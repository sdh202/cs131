What happens to Anna Franklin? She is thirty-nine, very attractive, \\"pretty was always too tame a word,\\" a single mother and journalist, who goes for a short vacation to Italy, leaving her six-year-old daughter with friends in London. When she does not return, her friends are justifiably alarmed, but knowing Anna's reliability they invent rational reasons for her continued absence - until it becomes apparent that she may never return.<br /><br />The two different accounts of Anna's adventures are cleverly interwoven with the narrative of what occurs at home with the daughter and friends who wait, as we wait, to discover just what is going on. The author also takes us on a journey into Anna's past to further develop her character. This chilling novel promises answers but never really delivers. Ms. Dunant's writing is taut and suspenseful.

In 1882, when author Willa Cather was nine years-old, her family left their home in Back Creek Valley, Virginia, and moved to Nebraska, near the settler country in Red Cloud where they farmed a homestead. Ms. Cather, often thought of as a chronicler of the pioneer American West, frequently drew on her memories of prairie culture and her own personal experiences. She wrote about the themes closest to her heart. Of primary importance was the drama of the immigrant struggling to survive in a new world, epitomized here in \\"My Antonia.\\" In this extraordinary novel, Miss Cather weaves together the story of Antonia Shimerda, an immigrant girl from Bohemia who represents the optimism, determination and pure grit that newcomers to America needed to make a successful life, and that of American-born Jim Burden, our narrator.<br /><br />Burden, a successful and cultured East-coast lawyer, is returning to his childhood home in Blackhawk, Nebraska for a visit. On the long train ride, he reminisces with an unnamed friend about the place where they had both grown up and about the people they knew - especially their dear friend Antonia, \\"who seemed to mean to us the country, the conditions, the whole adventure of our childhood.\\"<br /><br />When young Jim Burden was orphaned at age ten, he left his native Virginia to live with his grandparents on their farm, just outside of Blackhawk. At almost the same time that Jim arrived, the Shimerda family settled on their land. Mrs. Shimerda had argued effectively for a move to America so that the children, especially Ambrosch, the eldest son, would have the chance to make a better life for themselves, with more possibilities of moving up in the social hierarchy and of acquiring wealth. The Bohemian newcomers were the Burden's closest neighbors. Fourteen year-old Antonia Shimerda, the eldest daughter became a close friend of Jim's. He was immediately drawn to her warmth and friendliness. When Antonia's father, a sensitive, refined man, discovered that Jim was educated he asked the boy to teach his daughter to speak English. \\"Te-e-ach, te-e-ach my &Aacute;n-tonia!\\" he told/asked Mrs. Burden. Together the two young people worked the land and explored the glorious prairie. And Antonia began to learn English.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Antonia's studies came to an end with her father's tragic suicide. The man missed his native land terribly and was not able to accept his family's extreme poverty or the demands of his wife and son. When he lost his only friends, he sunk into a deep depression from which he was not able to escape. After Mr. Shimerda's death, Antonia had to work even harder, performing the heaviest, most physically demanding chores, just to keep the farm from going under. She was not able to go to school with Jim, and began to slowly lose the refined ways she had learned from her dad.<br /><br />The author describes Antonia's life as Jim perceives it, and from information he gathers from others about the long periods when he did not have contact with her. Their widely different positions in society dictated their life choices and their fortunes. And their lives, their personal histories, parallel the changes and the transformation of the Great Plains. When Antonia and Jim explored the Nebraskan wilderness, it was a wilderness as far as the eye could see. \\"There seemed to be nothing to see; no fences, no creeks or trees, no hills or fields. If there was a road, I could not make it out in the faint starlight. There was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of which countries are made. No, there was nothing but land--slightly undulating...\\" And, \\"I had the feeling that the world was left behind, that we had got over the edge of it, and were outside man's jurisdiction. I had never before looked up at the sky when there was not a familiar mountain ridge against it. But this was the complete dome of heaven, all there was of it.\\" When Jim makes his return trip by train, years later, everything had changed.<br /><br />Willa Cather's prose is straightforward, the narrative is deceptively simple and crystal clear. Her characters are complex and the wonderful, richly textured descriptions of the landscape and life on the plains make reading the novel pure pleasure. The author also captures the interior landscape of her characters with great perception and sensitivity. This is a great work of fiction which depicts a people, and a place in time, which only remain on the pages of a book, preserved vividly by Willa Cather.<br /><br />This Barnes and Nobel Classic Edition provides an Introduction and Notes by Gordon Tapper, author and Assistant Professor of English at De Pauw University, as well as a biography of Willa Cather, and a chronology of her life and work; a timeline of significant events that provides the book's historical context; an outline of key themes and plot points; and discussion questions ideal for book club conversations.<br /><br />H.L.

Eric Ashworth, creative chemist, with a touch of entrepreneurial genius and a craving for exotic drugs, awakens in an L.A. jail, badly burned, thinking he's in Hell. He has amnesia. Poor guy can only remember the name \\"Desiree,\\" but cannot recollect who or what the moniker is attached to. His knack for remembering past experiences is so shot, in fact, that the first cop he speaks with has to tell him his own name.<br /><br />Eric's learned memory is also effected. He is able to recall some chemical formulas, the concept of profit and loss, and still possesses a minor ability to devise better ways to zone people out through the wonders of modern chemistry. However, he had been \\"unique\\" before the lab explosion, and the overdose that erased eight seconds worth of his gray matter. Ashworth is \\"irreplaceable\\" to those who hired him. He had possessed brilliance - the ability, perhaps, to cure diseases like cancer. Instead he chose to design and produce recreational drugs. Discovered and backed by big bucks from an underworld honcho, Eric and his multitude of skills went to work, producing and distributing drugs. He received, and still does, dire threats from a toady thug and his retarded, violent son as to what they will do to him if he blows the job - literally and figuratively.<br /><br />There is an image that occasionally flashes across his mind. \\"A ball of fire, half the size of the house itself rose to the sky. Beautiful.\\" \\"Between the flash and the roar, there wasn't any space at all.\\"<br /><br />Ashworth's lawyer, whom he doesn't remember meeting, bails him out of the clink and takes him to a low rent dive, Hotel Firebird, Room 621, where his neighbors are pimps, whores, buyers, sellers, and lots of bugs. I gather from the psychedelic narrative that the bugs are both the creepy crawly kind that bite, (occasionally painted in day-glo colors - or viewed through day-glo colored retinas), and also the kind people wear taped to their bodies - \\"tapeworms.\\" Eric samples a mysterious new drug called \\"Skin,\\" \\"Cradle,\\" or \\"Derma\\" that synthesizes the sensations of touch, and allows him to time-travel inside his skull for weeks. Due to Skin, or the slow, inevitable return of his memory, or both, he begins to recall his life as a clandestine criminal chemist and his relationship with Desiree, his fortune telling lover. Perhaps he would have been better-off to have remained an amnesiac.<br /><br />Craig Clevenger can sure write!! I have highlighted and book-marked phrases and paragraphs throughout the novel to go back and reread. I may not have understood as much about our protagonist as I would have liked, or empathized with him a whole lot at times, but the author's heavily stylized, wired prose is exceptional - no doubt about it! I will say that the parts of the narrative dealing with Ashworth's childhood, his parents and his fear of violent storms is brilliant and very sensitively handled. Other characters are introduced here: fellow residents of Hotel Firebird, Jack and the Beanstalk, their friend Donna, Detective Ainslinger, Manhattan White and his sicko son, even Desiree - but they all just move on by. I'm in Eric's head and everyone else is a blur.<br /><br />As for the storyline, the reader is carried along on sheer manic energy, at times moving with the beat and allowing meaning to rush past - like some terrific 60's acid rock song - or trip. (My age is showing!). I am glad Mr. Clevenger kept the page number at 212. I couldn't have run with him much farther. But it was a really good trip.<br /><br />I am reminded here of Will Christopher Baer's \\"Kiss Me Judas.\\" Although I like the character of ex-cop Phineas Poe more than Eric Ashworth, I am sure if the two ever met, they'd get along very well. I bet their respective creators would also.<br /><br />I have not read \\"The Contortionist's Handbook\\" but plan on doing so soon. Craig Clevenger is extremely talented and I hope his new novel does as well as it should, based on merit! Kudos!<br />JANA	2005-10-10

A friend and I were out shopping a few weeks ago and we both picked up Bob Dylan's \\"No Direction Home: The Soundtrack\\" CD,  which is the 7th volume in Dylan's archival Bootleg Series, and also the soundtrack for Martin Scorsese's excellent PBS documentary of the same title. The album is outstanding and now that my shopping pal's birthday is coming up, Halloween actually, I decided that Dylan's \\"Lyrics, 1962-1985\\" would be a near perfect gift. She is a major Dylan fan, as am I, and we have been for almost forty years. Time flies!<br /><br />One of the deciding factors for making this purchase is that the hardcover volume edition makes an excellent, elegant presentation. The cover is laminated and each poem is printed singly on large, cream-stock pages with colored headers. Arranged by album, the book is a compilation of all of Dylan's writings and drawings, ('62 - '85), some wonderful pen sketches ranging in topic from roadside scenes to the romantic, plus 120 new compositions and an Index of song titles. \\"Lyrics, 1962-1985\\" is an extraordinary celebration of the artist's/composer's work.<br /><br /> \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" Tangled Up In Blue,\\" \\"Masters of War,\\" \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright,\\" \\"With God On Our Side,\\" \\"It Ain't Me Babe,\\" \\"My Back Pages,\\" \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" \\"Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again,\\" \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,\\" \\"Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You,\\" \\"This Wheel's On Fire,\\" \\"Shelter From The Storm,\\" etc., and hundreds of others - they're all here! Dylan's liner notes and stream-of-consciousness short prose pieces really enhance the text.<br /><br />Bob Dylan is a songwriter, musician and poet - an artistic genius and innovator whose tremendous body of work has had a major impact on over 40 years of American music, from the oldest anonymous folk ballads through blues and country into rock-and-roll. He expanded popular music by including politics, social commentary and philosophy into its vocabulary. He told more folks what was happening than the politicians and news reporters combined...and the counterculture loved him! We still do! While exploring and creating musical styles, Dylan did remain true to his roots in traditional American song.<br /><br />I am so sorry that the book is out of print.

Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series is without a doubt my favorite in all fiction. (I consider J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Ring\\" trilogy to be in a category of its own). I had been hoping for another novel about the fabulous time-traveling Fraser family but thought \\"The Fiery Cross\\" would be the last. Needless to say, when I heard that a sixth book was in the works, I reread my already well-worn copies of the first five installments, and pre-ordered \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes.\\" I must say that Ms. Gabaldon is the only author I know of who is able to maintain her storyline, the tension and excitement, through thousands of words, and six novels, over a period of fifteen years. She continually invents new adventures, accurately recreates history, and allows her characters and their relationships to grow to extraordinary depth. I can only say BRAVO(!), as she has yet again come up with a winner.<br /><br />As Gabaldon fans know, Claire and James Fraser have weathered more storms than most. They crossed oceans and centuries to make a life together. Readers were first introduced to Jamie and Claire in \\"Outlander,\\" right after Claire made the voyage from peaceful 20th century Scotland to 18th century Scotland and total mayhem. We witnessed passion, love and friendship grow between this couple as they began married life, and experienced adventure, adversity and attempted to alter history. They finally settled in North Carolina along with their daughter Brianna, her husband Roger, their son Jemmie, many of their family members and friends from Scotland, including most of Jamies fellow prisoners from Ardsmuir and hundreds of refugees in exile in the wake of the Jacobite rebellion.<br /><br />Claire, now a beautiful matron in her 50s, spends much of her time utilizing her physician's skills and searching for ways to bring 20th century science to her 18th century practice. James is the founder of the Fraser's Ridge community and acts as an unofficial clan chief to the families who look to him for leadership. Brianna and Roger, and Fergus and Marsali are young couples coping with a heavy daily work load and parenting. This is a period when backbreaking work, from first light to last, is necessary for survival.<br /><br />\\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\" opens in the year 1772 on the eve of the American Revolution. Even in the backwoods colony of Fraser's Ridge, NC, people are rebelling at the increased taxation by the British, with no government representation for themselves. Word of the Boston Massacre has reached the Frasers and their neighbors, and, in fact, one of the novel's characters was involved in the event. The American colonies are in turmoil. Tension builds as isolated cabins are burned in the wilderness and families murdered. North Carolina Governor Josiah Martin asks James Fraser to help unite the backcountry population, including the Native Americans, in support of the King. However, Jamie knows about the revolution to come. His wife, Claire, has traveled back in time from the twentieth century, as have his daughter Brianna and her husband. They are well aware that it's only a matter of a few years before the start of the War of Independence.<br /><br />Looming over the Frasers is the threat of a tiny newspaper clipping from The Wilmington Gazette, dated 1776, which Claire discovered before returning to the 18th century. The article reports the destruction of the house on Fraser's Ridge, and the death by fire of James Fraser and all his family. Claire and James know from experience that it is not possible to change or effect future events, but they are determined to do all in their power to prove the newspaper report wrong.<br /><br />While not as good a read as \\"The Outlander,\\" (but what is?), this is a fabulous novel and the historical events portrayed are fascinating. I am from the Northeast and when I studied the American Revolution I usually focused on events in Philadelphia and New England. Ms. Gabaldon gives anotherperspective here, which has motivated me to further explore the history in the southern colonies.<br /><br />The author has an imagination for which I will always be grateful, and she is as skilled a writer as there ever was. She develops characters so that they truly come to life and remain with the reader forever - no small accomplishment. Her ability to capture the essence of a loving relationship, whether between lovers, spouses, parents and children, or friends can easily move her readers to tears. The dialogue is excellent and the wonderful Scottish dialect, interspersed with Gaelic, adds much to the novels' credibility and the readers' enjoyment.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes.\\" And for those who have not read the other books in the series, do yourselves a huge favor and begin with \\"Outlander\\" and read straight through all five sequels. You will be delighted and richly rewarded.<br /><br />Just a closing note: I know many men who have read and enjoyed these books. These novels are much more than chick lit!!

This is where he wrote the glorious stories later called \\"The Jungle Books.\\" In her imaginative debut novel, Ms. Vinton mingles fact with fiction and vividly brings to life Kipling's early years in Bombay, India, where he lived a pampered existence as the only son of a well-to-do British family. She connects his very early experiences in India, as well as later less agreeable ones in England, with the material he used to create the wonderful books and characters that have delighted children and adults for generations.<br /><br />Kipling was born in Bombay, where his father, John Lockwood Kipling, was an arts and crafts teacher at the Jeejeebhoy School. His mother was a sister-in-law of the painter Edward Burne-Jones. Ruddy, as Kipling was affectionately called, was brought up by an ayah who taught him Hindustani as his first language. At the age of six he was taken to England by his parents and left for five years with extended family, virtual strangers. This experience, the abrupt separation from his parents and India, his first home, proved to be a traumatic one for the little boy. He was to write about his feelings during this period later in life, when he dubs his foster home, \\"The House of Desolation.\\" .<br /><br />In 1892 Kipling married Caroline Starr Balestier, the sister of an American publisher and writer. The young couple moved to the United States, to Brattleboro Vermont where the author wrote the stories which comprise \\"The Jungle Books.\\" The most familiar, and perhaps best loved, are the Mowgli tales where an Indian baby, Mowgli, is lost in the jungle after Shere Khan, (the tiger), kills his family. He is taken to safety by Bagheera, (the black panther,) and placed  with a wolf family that has a brand new litter. The stories tell of how Mowgli is reared by his foster parents, alongside the wolf pups. Over time the child is instructed by a series of animal mentors in the rules or \\"Laws\\" of the jungle. There is also great enmity between Mowgli and the tiger Shere Khan who killed the boy's parents. Kipling portrays the natural world, and especially its creatures, in a logical anthropomorphized manner, so entertaining to both children and adults.<br /><br />Rudyard and his proud, pregnant wife Carrie arrive in Brattleboro to build their dream home, Naulakha. Kipling left the hectic literary life behind in London, searching for a quiet, rural setting to raise his family and to write. The year is 1892 and the twenty-six year-old author has very little money. However, he brought with him to America something of great value - the seed of an idea, a gem of a story about a feral child raised by wolves. He wants to develop that theme in this new world.<br /><br />The Connolly family, Jack, Addie and their eleven year-old son Joe, are the Kipling's nearest neighbors. Jack, a struggling immigrant farmer, is an angry, disappointed man, who labors under constant, backbreaking work for little monetary gain. He fears the harsh winter months ahead. He also resents the Kiplings, and what he believes to be their high and mighty airs and easy circumstances. Addie takes in their laundry, which fuels Jack's anger even more, although they need every penny. But young Joe is entranced by Rudyard. He has never met a more magical person in his life. As they become friends, Kipling tries out his tales on his young admirer, and it becomes evident that Kipling is as much inspired by the boy as Joe is by him. Joe, in fact, becomes sort of a muse. Kipling asks the boy questions and Joe's responses are necessary to flesh out Mowgli's character and life. Joe responds with enthusiasm, and begins to identify with the imaginary foundling. Unfortunately, when the boy returns home after his stimulating conversations with Kipling, he faces an angry jealous father.<br /><br />The parallels, contrasts, and interactions between these two families, and the mutually rewarding relationship that Kipling shares with Joe make for fascinating and rich reading. The narrative is extremely well written and the descriptive passages, whether of the landscape or conversations between Joe and Kipling which conjure-up Mowgli and his magical friends are wonderful, absolutely superb at times. The complexity and intensity of the characters, and some of the situations they face, leave the reader with a sense of sadness. There is grief here. The creative process comes out the ultimate winner, I believe. Joe, with his extraordinary imagination will always be the \\"changeling child,\\" with too much in common with the fictional Mowgli for his own good. Jack is an unhappy man, but perhaps is better off living with his rage than with the understanding that he can never give his son what Kipling can. And Kipling, is hampered by haunting boyhood memories, a domineering wife and so much loss.<br /><br />A most unusual and original novel. Highly recommended!

Former NYPD detective turned author Dorothy Uhnak tries for suspense in this would-be thriller about a group of neighborhood kids who know more than they're telling about a brutal murder. The characters are believable, however the storyline is too formulaic and the conclusion comes from way out of left field. No surprises here, unfortunately. I had hoped for much better from Ms. Uhnak.<br /><br />On a cold December night in late December, 1935, six kids from the Bronx flee a murder scene and vow to each other never to speak about what went down that evening. Witnesses testify that they saw one of the boys' fathers kill his childhood friend. The suspect, an alcoholic in a drunken stupor, confesses and is eventually electrocuted for the crime. The events of that long ago night will haunt each member of the group as they grow through adolescence to become major movers and shakers in their communities and country. Their dark secret will continue to taint their lives, and those of the people they love, until the denouement in the final chapters.<br /><br />Again, the characters are well portrayed, but the tale of kids who witness/participate in a gruesome event, keep a lifelong secret which effects them all, and reunite as adults when the \\"truth\\" is revealed at last, is not a new one. The period, the Great Depression through the 1950's, and the settings, the Bronx, post WWII Germany, Washington DC, Israel and Hollywood give the novel a bit of needed pizzazz.

In 1882, when author Willa Cather was nine years-old, her family left their home in Back Creek Valley, Virginia, and moved to Nebraska, near the settler country in Red Cloud where they farmed a homestead. Ms. Cather, often thought of as a chronicler of the pioneer American West, frequently drew on her memories of prairie culture and her own personal experiences. She wrote about the themes closest to her heart. Of primary importance was the drama of the immigrant struggling to survive in a new world, epitomized here in \\"My Antonia.\\" In this extraordinary novel, Miss Cather weaves together the story of Antonia Shimerda, an immigrant girl from Bohemia who represents the optimism, determination and pure grit that newcomers to America needed to make a successful life, and that of American-born Jim Burden, our narrator.<br /><br />Burden, a successful and cultured East-coast lawyer, is returning to his childhood home in Blackhawk, Nebraska for a visit. On the long train ride, he reminisces with an unnamed friend about the place where they had both grown up and about the people they knew - especially their dear friend Antonia, \\"who seemed to mean to us the country, the conditions, the whole adventure of our childhood.\\"<br /><br />When young Jim Burden was orphaned at age ten, he left his native Virginia to live with his grandparents on their farm, just outside of Blackhawk. At almost the same time that Jim arrived, the Shimerda family settled on their land. Mrs. Shimerda had argued effectively for a move to America so that the children, especially Ambrosch, the eldest son, would have the chance to make a better life for themselves, with more possibilities of moving up in the social hierarchy and of acquiring wealth. The Bohemian newcomers were the Burden's closest neighbors. Fourteen year-old Antonia Shimerda, the eldest daughter became a close friend of Jim's. He was immediately drawn to her warmth and friendliness. When Antonia's father, a sensitive, refined man, discovered that Jim was educated he asked the boy to teach his daughter to speak English. \\"Te-e-ach, te-e-ach my &Aacute;n-tonia!\\" he told/asked Mrs. Burden. Together the two young people worked the land and explored the glorious prairie. And Antonia began to learn English.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Antonia's studies came to an end with her father's tragic suicide. The man missed his native land terribly and was not able to accept his family's extreme poverty or the demands of his wife and son. When he lost his only friends, he sunk into a deep depression from which he was not able to escape. After Mr. Shimerda's death, Antonia had to work even harder, performing the heaviest, most physically demanding chores, just to keep the farm from going under. She was not able to go to school with Jim, and began to slowly lose the refined ways she had learned from her dad.<br /><br />The author describes Antonia's life as Jim perceives it, and from information he gathers from others about the long periods when he did not have contact with her. Their widely different positions in society dictated their life choices and their fortunes. And their lives, their personal histories, parallel the changes and the transformation of the Great Plains. When Antonia and Jim explored the Nebraskan wilderness, it was a wilderness as far as the eye could see. \\"There seemed to be nothing to see; no fences, no creeks or trees, no hills or fields. If there was a road, I could not make it out in the faint starlight. There was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of which countries are made. No, there was nothing but land--slightly undulating...\\" And, \\"I had the feeling that the world was left behind, that we had got over the edge of it, and were outside man's jurisdiction. I had never before looked up at the sky when there was not a familiar mountain ridge against it. But this was the complete dome of heaven, all there was of it.\\" When Jim makes his return trip by train, years later, everything had changed.<br /><br />Willa Cather's prose is straightforward, the narrative is deceptively simple and crystal clear. Her characters are complex and the wonderful, richly textured descriptions of the landscape and life on the plains make reading the novel pure pleasure. The author also captures the interior landscape of her characters with great perception and sensitivity. This is a great work of fiction which depicts a people, and a place in time, which only remain on the pages of a book, preserved vividly by Willa Cather.<br /><br />I prefer to purchase Enriched Classics fiction whenever available.

I remain hooked!	\\"Deadly Illusions\\" is author Brenda Joyce's seventh installment in the historical mystery/romance series featuring New York City debutante Francesca Cahill. Ms. Cahill, society bluestocking, and heiress to a considerable fortune, has done remarkably well so far as an amateur sleuth, NYC's first female private investigator and a major novelty in her chosen profession. It is only 1902, after all, and women still have seventeen more years before the United States Congress and Senate approve the 19th Amendment, giving them the right to vote. Francesca has solved the case of the City Strangler, the brutal Cross Killer mystery, two child kidnappings, several murders, captured a stalker, discovered the ringleaders of a child prostitution ring and had them put behind bars, restoring the young girls to their families, and thus has earned the right to call herself \\"Crime-Solver Extraordinaire,\\" as printed on her Tiffany embossed business cards. Of course she has had the assistance of her dear friend and former love, police commissioner Rick Bragg, to teach her the ropes. Unfortunately for the nascent romance, Rick's estranged wife, Leigh Ann, returned from a lengthy stay in Europe, and nipped it in the bud.<br /><br />In \\"Deadly Promises,\\" the novel prior to this one, Leigh Ann is crippled in an accident and, extremely depressed, she has given up on starting life anew with her husband - just when Rick realizes he never stopped loving her. Calder Hart, Rick's half brother, wealthy art connoisseur, rogue and rake, is bent on reforming his ways now that he is engaged to marry Francesca. However, he  has serious misgivings about the marriage as his feelings for his fiancee intensify. At times he is convinced that he is not good enough for her, a sentiment shared by Andrew Cahill, Fran's father, Rick Bragg, Daisy Jones, Calder's former mistress who is out for revenge, and various other members of society. Francesca believes in Calder despite his past and realizes she loves him. Clearly the two are an eccentric match made in heaven. Not only do they share a firm friendship, she is Calder's first and only friend, but sparks fly when they're together.<br /><br />While the ever addictive soap opera continues, our amateur sleuth discovers that three working class Irish women have had their throats cut, with a dull knife, by a madman newspaper reporters have dubbed The Slasher. Two of the victims survived but one was stabbed and strangled to death. Maggie Kennedy, Fran's friend and the mother of young assistant detective Joel Kennedy, is an acquaintance and neighbor of the three women, and is thought to be in danger also. She fits the victim profile. Of course Ms. Cahill is determined to catch the killer before he strikes again.<br /><br />Miss Joyce's storyline is not as strong here as it has been in the last two installments of the Cahill/Bragg/Hart mystery/suspense romances. As always, the mysteries are secondary to the various relationships between the fascinating cast of characters. However, not too much is going on this time around, and the constant repetition of various predicaments, especially Calder's and Francesca's jealousy of each other, and the constant sparring and bickering among the overly competitive half brothers is tiring and melodramatic. This case is one of the least interesting in the series, and is repetitious also. Women who live in New York City's tenements are being victimized and a woman hating perpetrator is on the loose. So, what else is new? As a matter of fact, many of the author's male villains hate women, including the police chief. I would like to see some variation in character flaws and criminal behavior.<br /><br />I must admit I am still hooked on the series, the developing characters and their ongoing, individual stories. These books actually seems more like soap opera episodes and installments in a serial novel rather than stand alone romance/mysteries. If you are interested, I would suggest reading the previous Francesca Cahill novels before \\"Deadly Illusions,\\" as this is a continuing saga and extremely addictive. I warn you there are many flaws, but I have just finished seven books - so what else can I say?<br /><br />Come meet these personages, if you have the patience, and become involved in their lives, loves, traumas, mysteries, and the delightful historical setting of 1902-1903 New York City, with its society balls and glitter, the tenements and roughs, gambling halls and beautiful, exotic call girls. Seth Low, the mayor, was recently elected on a reform platform to fight the Tammany Hall machine, and the police commissioner he appointed took some of the actions the fictional Rick Bragg has taken and faced many of the same difficult issues Bragg faces in attempting to reform the terribly corrupt police department. If Ms Joyce takes the series past 1903, Rick will be out of a job as the next administration is a \\"Tammany beast.\\" Perhaps, Bragg will use the opportunity to run for Senator. ENJOY!!

Ms. Cahill, society bluestocking, and heiress to a considerable fortune, has done remarkably well so far as an amateur sleuth, NYC's first female private investigator and a major novelty in her chosen profession.

What astonished Fran even more than his declaration of marital intent was her decision to accept him...and I don't think she is on the rebound. Clearly the two are an eccentric match made in heaven. Not only do they share a firm friendship, she is Calder's first and only friend, but sparks fly when they're together. While Ms. Cahill is sorting out her complex feelings for Calder and Rick, and dealing with the former's precipitous announcement of their engagement, a number of beautiful adolescent girls are being abducted from the streets of Manhattan.<br /><br />Francesca learns that lovely teenage Emily O'Hare has gone missing, and fears that the girl has been kidnapped. She quickly discovers that Emily is not the only young girl to disappear in the last few weeks. This new case is by far the most intense to date, as it deals with child prostitution, a crime both Calder and Bragg want to shield the young woman from. But, as usual, Fran is determined to find the girls and bring them home, if at all possible.<br /><br />Sound like a soap opera? It is, in all but title! I have become hooked on the series, the developing characters and their ongoing, individual stories. Ms. Joyce got off to a shaky start but hit her stride a book or two ago, and continues to improve with \\"Deadly Promise.\\" While far from perfect in terms of believability, this series, in classic soap style, is loads of fun even though it frequently stretches readers' credulity. These books actually seems more like installments in a serial novel than stand alone romance/mysteries. In fact, most of the characters are from the previous books and the mystery is part of the continuing storyline, involving Francesca, her family, friends and those who touch upon their lives. This approach suits very well and certainly has me returning for more.<br /><br />If you are interested, I would suggest reading the previous Francesca Cahill novels before \\"Deadly Promise,\\" as this is a continuing saga and extremely addictive. As I review this novel, I am reading the latest installment, \\"Deadly Illusion\\" and hope the author continues to write about Francesca, her family, Calder, et.al.

In 1882, when author Willa Cather was nine years-old, her family left their home in Back Creek Valley, Virginia, and moved to Nebraska, near the settler country in Red Cloud where they farmed a homestead. Ms. Cather, often thought of as a chronicler of the pioneer American West, frequently drew on her memories of prairie culture and her own personal experiences. She wrote about the themes closest to her heart. Of primary importance was the drama of the immigrant struggling to survive in a new world, epitomized here in \\"My Antonia.\\" In this extraordinary novel, Miss Cather weaves together the story of Antonia Shimerda, an immigrant girl from Bohemia who represents the optimism, determination and pure grit that newcomers to America needed to make a successful life, and that of American-born Jim Burden, our narrator.<br /><br />Burden, a successful and cultured East-coast lawyer, is returning to his childhood home in Blackhawk, Nebraska for a visit. On the long train ride, he reminisces with an unnamed friend about the place where they had both grown up and about the people they knew - especially their dear friend Antonia, \\"who seemed to mean to us the country, the conditions, the whole adventure of our childhood.\\"<br /><br />When young Jim Burden was orphaned at age ten, he left his native Virginia to live with his grandparents on their farm, just outside of Blackhawk, Nebraska.

When Lord Henry Oliphant is appointed Governor-General to India in 1836, his devoted sister, Lady Eleanor Oliphant, a 34 year-old spinster, agrees to accompany him as does Harriet, their artistic younger sibling, and also their cousin Lafayette, a lady's man and a libertine. Lady Eleanor keeps a journal in which she recounts the significant events that occur over the six year period they spend on the subcontinent, as well as the more personal changes in character and points of view.<br /><br />Susanna Moore, a superb writer, brings vividly to life the grandeur, beauty and squalor that was India - a place so far removed from anything the Oliphant's had previously experienced as to be totally unimaginable. The small group of family members arrive in the country, like so many before them, with great confidence in the superiority of their British aristocratic heritage and their right to rule. Each is to change slowly over the years, and as they become accustomed to the heat, the brilliant local color, the extremes of wealth and poverty, the claustrophobic inbred social life, each one grows to love India, and all are transformed.<br /><br />Elegantly written and well researched, Ms. Moore recreates with great accuracy the language and experiences of an English lady living in early 19th century India. \\"One Last Look\\" is loosely based on the lives of a real governor-general and his sisters who went out to India in 1836 to serve the British Empire. The diary is fictional and spans seven years, but primary sources for the narrative are the published writings of sisters Emily and Fanny Eden, who accompanied their brother George, Earl of Auckland, when he was sent to Calcutta as Governor General. The author also consulted the diaries of another period traveler and contemporary of the Edens, the wife of a civil servant, described by Moore as \\"the sublime Fanny Parks.\\"<br /><br />Governor Oliphant's reign has been largely unsuccessful. Hoping for support in his quest to win Afghanistan for Britain, he undertakes the \\"Great Progress\\" in 1937, a two-and-a-half-year journey from Calcutta to Kabul to cement an alliance with the Maharajah Ranjit Singh, an old warlord. Accompanied by a huge retinue of 12,000 people, Lady Eleanor asks: \\"Why must we travel with scribes, equerries, victualers, cooks, officers with their wives and children and parrots and spaniels, tent pitchers, herdsmen, syces, grass cutters, musicians, dancing girls, water bearers, butchers, sweepers, tailors, valets, hairdressers, the Bombay Troop, the queen's 12th Regiment, the Irish guards and 2,000 native archers?\\" Because everything is a big production in India. Much of the author's extraordinary descriptions of this dramatic trip is taken directly from the journals of Emily Eden.<br /><br />Eleanor, Harriet and the \\"sublime Fanny\\" were adventurous, spirited women, who opened to their new bicultural experience and thrived. \\"The danger of this place is that I am learning to deny myself nothing,\\" writes Eleanor. And, \\"My life - once a fastidious nibble - has now turned into an endless disorderly feast.\\" These women were far different from the memsahibs who came later to India in the early 20th century. The staid latecomers felt it necessary to enforce their hierarchical society, and to maintain English dress, customs and culture, rather than to adapt more and to enjoy.<br /><br />\\"One Last Look\\" is an atmospheric novel, the action is character driven, the conflicts internal.

Kathryn Harrison's \\"The Kiss,\\" is a powerful, beautifully written autobiographical work about her four year incestuous relationship with her sexually and emotionally exploitive father, her years with her dysfunctional family, especially her narcissistic mother, and ultimately, her story of survival. This is not a \\"tell-all,\\" written to titillate voyeuristic readers. There is nothing graphically sexual written in this memoir of the author's childhood and early adult life. Pain, however, is found here in abundance, as well as courage.<br /><br />When Ms. Harrison sought professional help because she feared for her life, (a potential suicide), and her sanity, she worked very hard to revisit her past, to learn about and understand the horrors she experienced, and to explore her family's dynamics, particularly those between her mother, father and herself. Although the subject of incest is a major taboo, the act - the crime - is much more prevalent in our society than one would imagine. Because there is so much shame attached to incestuous relationships, victims rarely divulge their dark secrets, and so documentation and accurate statistics are difficult to come by.<br /><br />Kathryn's parents met when they were seventeen. They fell in love, and when the teenage girl became pregnant with Kathryn, the young couple married and lived with the disapproving maternal grandparents. Before the infant turned one year-old, her grandfather pressured her father, just a boy really, to leave and get a divorce so his wife could begin her life anew. Kathryn saw her father twice over the next twenty years. Her mother, who provided her child with almost no emotional stability, moved into her own apartment when Kathryn turned six, leaving her behind and no phone number or mailing address where she could be contacted. She did visit, however, and spent time with her daughter. Both grandparents raised the little girl, who was bright, gifted, and creative. She turned into a beautiful, but extremely troubled young woman, longing to be loved.<br /><br />When Harrison entered college, her father, now an ordained minister, reestablished contact with her. He had remarried and had another family. Oddly enough, Kathryn's mother, who appeared to be still in love with her ex-husband, arranged for him to spend a week with their 20 year-old daughter and herself, and invited them both to stay at her small apartment. She vied with her daughter for the man's attention throughout his visit. When he left, Kathryn drove him to the airport. Ms Harrison writes: \\"A voice over the public-address system announces the final boarding call. As I pull away, feeling the resistance of his hand behind my head, how tightly he holds me to him, the kiss changes. It is no longer a chaste, closed-lipped kiss. My father pushes his tongue deep into my mouth: wet, insistent, exploring, then withdrawn. He picks up his camera case, and, smiling brightly, he joins the end of the line of passengers disappearing into the airplane.\\" She wonders if the weird, unsettled feelings she has are appropriate...if other fathers kiss their daughters like this. \\"In years to come,\\" she writes, \\"I'll think of the kiss as a kind of transforming sting, like that of a scorpion: a narcotic that spreads from my mouth to my brain.\\" This is the kiss of the book's title - a turning point in the author's life and in her relationship with her dad.<br /><br />For twenty years, throughout her childhood and adolescence, Kathryn yearned to have a father, like other children. It is painful to imagine the ambivalence she felt after \\"the kiss,\\" and the guilt she felt for that very ambivalence after their physical relationship began. This is a man, a minister of God, who tells his very vulnerable daughter, that he \\"was frightened when he felt that he loved me more than God, but the heresy was resolved when God announced to my father that He was revealing Himself to my father through me.\\"<br /><br />The most shocking aspects ofMs. Harrison's narrative do not deal directly with the incest, her father's criminal behavior, her mother's extreme narcissism, or either set of grandparents. What truly astonishes is the realization that this woman survived to become a relatively healthy adult, an extraordinarily gifted writer, and a loving mother and wife. There is much here that is hopeful and inspiring. I purposefully put off reading \\"The Kiss\\" until I had read some of the author's fiction. I wanted to keep the memoir in perspective and not allow it to color my opinion about her other work. I have read three of her novels so far and have become quite a fan.<br /><br />There has been way too much publicity surrounding \\"The Kiss,\\" for all the wrong reasons, as far as I am concerned. Ms. Harrison has been accused of sensationalism, of writing about such a culturally taboo topic to make money, for not writing more from a victim's point of view - not portraying herself as sufficiently devastated, etc.. In an interview, the author said that one of the reasons she wrote this story, is because her first novel, where the heroine has an affair with her father, is deemed autobiographical by critics. The female character was/is totally unlike Harrison, and she felt as if she had \\"betrayed her own history.\\" She wanted to set the record straight.<br /><br />This searing account of an obsessive, forbidden love affair, in all its complexity, is brilliantly documented. There is a noticeable lack of affect in Ms. Harrison's sparse prose, demonstrating how detached she was from her feelings of rage, sadness and pain. She also discusses here her bouts with anorexia and bulimia, her attempts to reclaim her life and her quest for a personal identity. Not easy to read - but well worth the effort.<br />JANAeal directly with the incest, her father's criminal behavior, her mother's extreme narcissism, or either set of grandparents.

This searing account of an obsessive, forbidden love affair, in all its complexity, is brilliantly documented. There is a noticeable lack of affect in Ms. Harrison's sparse prose, demonstrating how detached she was from her feelings of rage, sadness and pain. She also discusses here her bouts with anorexia and bulimia, her attempts to reclaim her life and her quest for a personal identity. Not easy to read - but well worth the effort.  JANA	2005-09-27

Rookie Assistant United States Attorney Vicki Allegretti shows up for a routine meeting with a confidential informant and finds herself staring into the barrel of a black nine millimeter semiautomatic Glock. It seems she interrupted a robbery. Vicki fortunately escapes with her life. Her ATF partner Morty and the CI, a pregnant woman, are not as fortunate, turning what should have been a simple interview about the straw purchase of two guns into a triple homicide. When the pair of teenage felons escape they leave behind a brick of almost pure cocaine, called \\"fish-scale cocaine\\" in the vernacular.<br /><br />The now deceased informant was going to testify against Reheema Bristow, a beautiful African American woman, with no prior arrests, who allegedly purchased two Colt 45.s at a local gun shop and illegally resold them to someone else - a straw purchase. When Bristow's mother, a crack addict, is brutally murdered right after the shootings, Vicki suspects a connection between the opening of a new \\"drug store\\" in the slum neighborhood known as Devil's Corner and the homicides. Heartbroken about her partner's death, and frustrated with the jurisdictional red tape holding up the investigation, (turf problems between local police, ATF and FBI), she decides to do some sleuthing herself, teaming up with Reheema in the process - a very unlikely duo, but it works. The two meet some extremely unsavory characters who wouldn't mind eliminating them both, as they attempt to solve the crimes.<br /><br />This is the first book I have read by Lisa Scottoline, as odd as that may seem - odd in that I am an avid reader and the author's novels are very popular. I am pleasantly surprised at the fascinating storyline about the business of drug dealing in our inner cities, apparently inspired by a real-life jury trial for crack-cocaine trafficking of members of one Philly's most violent gangs. I enjoyed Vicki as a character, although her self destructive romance/friendship with a married man was distracting. And I really liked the Philadelphia setting - my old stomping ground...and still a favorite place to visit.<br /><br />This is a good light read. I recommend it and will be looking into Ms. Scottoline's previous novels.<br /><br />JANAarried man was distracting.

Boston medical examiner Dr. Maura Isles returns from a Forensic Pathology conference in Paris to find four Brookline police cruisers, lights flashing, outside her home. When her neighbors, the cops, and finally friend and colleague, homicide detective Jane Rizzoli look at Maura in disbelief, she knows something is really wrong and that it must involve her. A dead woman has been found, sitting in the driver's seat of a car parked in front of her home. The Jane Doe, shot through the head, is Maura's body double. The two could be twins. And, in fact, the corpse shares her blood type and birth date. Further tests will show their DNA is a match. Maura was adopted in infancy and knows nothing about her birth mother or blood ties. The discovery that the same lawyer who handled Maura's adoption also handled the placement of the dead woman, another adoptee, is the final straw which sends Maura on a quest to discover her roots.<br /><br />Boston Police Detective Jane Rizzoli, in her eighth month of pregnancy, realizes that her search for the killer converges with Maura's own personal investigation. Her findings, which are inextricably linked to Isles' past and present, are gruesome and point to many more than one untimely, violent death. As Maura delves deeply into her history, it becomes clear she may be the killer's next target.<br /><br />\\"Body Double\\" is the first book I have read by Tess Gerritsen, but it won't be my last. Although this compelling suspense thriller is apparently part of an ongoing series featuring Dr. Isles, Detective Rizzoli, etc., it is definitely a stand alone novel. As I found myself riveted to this dark tale, I was glad to know that if I wanted to read more about the fascinating characters, I could do so in the author's previous books. Gerritsen's narrative is extremely well written, and at times, downright scary. Highly recommended!<br />JANA	2005-09-25

The Iditarod, sometimes called \\"The Last Great Race,\\" takes mushers, (dog sled racers), and their dog teams over 1150 miles of some of Alaska's roughest, most majestic terrain - jagged mountain ranges, iced-over areas of Norton Sound, frozen rivers, dense forests, desolate tundra and miles of windswept coastline. The temperatures frequently fall well below zero, with winds that can cause complete loss of visibility. Hazards of overflow, long hours of darkness and treacherous climbs and side hills are always present. From Anchorage, in south central Alaska, to Nome on the western Bering Sea coast, each team of 12 to 16 dogs and their musher cover over 1150 miles in 10 to 17 days. The winner takes home a $250,000 purse. But one has to be alive to collect it. This year's race has a major impediment to arriving at the finish line in one piece. It seems as if one of the contestants is eliminating the competition by cruel, unusual and permanent means.<br /><br />Top Iditarod mushers are dying on the trail in the most gruesome and bizarre ways. Three deaths have occurred before the halfway mark is reached in a race that has never claimed a life in its entire history. Jessie Arnold, the top female contender, is determined to win and not allow the terrible deaths/murders of her friends and colleagues to deter or distract her from her goal.<br /><br />State Trooper Alex Jensen, a gifted investigator, as well as a handsome bachelor, meets the attractive Jessie during the race and the two are immediately drawn to each other. Already committed to finding the killer before he/she can do any more harm, Jensen is especially anxious for Jessie, as she is now favored to win, and has thus become a bigger threat to the murderer. As more victims fall prey to mysterious injuries, Jensen realizes that the killer is after more than money and prestige.<br /><br />Although Sue Henry's \\"Murder on the Iditarod Trail\\" is filled with suspense, I must admit to being more thrilled/awed/terrified with the description of the race, the weather and its dangers, which seem much more difficult to evade than the threatened actions of a vicious, determined murderer. This excellent mystery really gives one an understanding of what a tough foe Mother Nature can be. The author wisely couples the disturbing details surrounding the murders with the dangers of the climate and the trail to build tension and rivet the reader to the page.<br /><br />The Iditarod is not just a dog sled race. It is a race in which unique men and woman, from all walks of life, compete. Man and animal are pitted against nature, and as each mile is covered, a tribute is paid to Alaska's past. The Iditarod Trail, now a National Historic Trail, had its beginnings as a mail and supply route from the coastal towns of Seward and Knik to the interior mining camps at Flat, Ophir, Ruby and beyond to the west coast communities of Unalakleet, Elim, Golovin, White Mountain and Nome. Mail and supplies went in. Gold came out. All via dog sled.

Miss Cahill, the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, is an unwilling member of New York City's social elite at the turn of the 20th century. She lives in a Fifth Avenue mansion, with her parents and older brother, attends glittering society balls and fundraisers, and is a champion for social reform. An intellectual, but not a snob, Francesca is determined to do something with her mind other than plan dinner parties. Unbeknownst to her mother, she enrolled in Barnard College with aspirations to become a journalist. However, since she met and fell in love with newly appointed police commissioner Rick Bragg and began solving crimes, her grades have been suffering. With each new book Rick's and Fran's friendship has grown and their love for each other has deepened, especially since they spend so much time together working on cases. Unfortunately, there are complications in the commissioner's life which prohibit him from proposing marriage and planning a future with the young woman he cares for so much.<br /><br />Although I am hooked on the series' secondary characters and their ongoing stories, I have been very skeptical about the quality and credibility of the narrative in the first three books. With \\"Deadly Desire\\" I think Ms. Joyce has hit her stride. This actually seems more like an installment in a serial novel than a stand alone romance/mystery. In fact, most of the characters are from the previous books and the mystery is part of the continuing storyline, involving Francesca, her family, friends and those who touch upon their lives. This approach suits very well and certainly has me returning for more. There are still some major flaws, but since I am so absorbed in the various subplots, I tend to overlook them at this point. The author has succeeded in holding my interest and has me coming back for more - not an easy thing to do!<br /><br />Sarah Channing, a brilliant artist and Francesca's soon-to-be sister-in-law, discovers that her art studio has been vandalized. One portrait, in particular, has been brutally slashed and smeared with blood red paint. Sarah pleads with Francesca to help her find the person who committed this savage act of destruction. Fran decides to interview Calder Hart, Rick's half brother, wealthy art connoisseur and womanizer, who has befriended Francesca and is clearly attracted to her. If any other artist in the area has had similar problems with vandals, Calder would know. However, involving him, spending more time with him, is courting trouble because Calder would like to be much more than Francesca's friend.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Rick's, (and Calder's),  family is having a reunion of sorts in New York and, of course Fran meets them all - patriarch, Rathe Bragg, mother Grace, sister Lucy Savage with her twin toddlers and adolescent stepson, and brother Rourke, a medical student. While lunching with Lucy, Francesca realizes that her new friend is being stalked by a ruthless criminal who followed her and her children from Texas. When the thug kidnaps Chrissy, one of the twins, Fran and the Bragg clan pull together to find the little girl...hopefully alive.<br /><br />Complicating things further, Leigh Ann Bragg, Rick's estranged wife, enters the picture and calls on Francesca. And of course, Fran's brother Evan continues having problems with his upcoming marriage, his father, and gambling debts. Sister Constance's marriage is rocky and her husband, British Lord Neil Montrose, is beside himself with angst, etc., etc..<br /><br />Say what you will, I am hooked!

Miss Cahill, the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, is an unwilling member of New York City's social elite at the turn of the 20th century, 1902 to be exact. She lives in a Fifth Avenue mansion, with her parents and older brother, attends glittering society balls and fundraisers, and allows herself, occasionally, to be courted by the town's most eligible bachelors. However, Francesca is a marginal player, at best, in the comings and goings of Manhattan's rich and famous, to her mother's dismay. She is an intellectual, and determined to do something with her mind other than plan dinner parties. Unbeknownst to her mother, she has enrolled in Barnard College with aspirations to become a journalist. Recently, however, coinciding with newly appointed police commissioner Rick Bragg's move to New York, Francesca has taken to sleuthing....and romance. Her grades are suffering as a result.<br /><br />Back in book one, \\"Deadly Love,\\" when a neighbor's son was kidnapped, Fran stepped in, solved the crime, and saved the day. This is when she met and worked with the extremely handsome, charismatic Bragg for the first time. From their initial introduction, sparks began to fly, and as Francesca found herself becoming more involved with sleuthing than journalism, stronger feelings than mere physical attraction developed between the sophisticated man about town and the naive young woman. Unfortunately, there are complications in the commissioner's life which prohibit him from courting Francesca.<br /><br />Although family and friends have warned her to stay out of police matters, Fran has continued her work as an amateur PI. She now accepts a new case from a woman who fears her new husband is unfaithful. While spying on the philanderer, she stumbles over the dead, mutilated body of a woman. Francesca is determined to find the murderer, who, it appears, has killed before. The same unmistakable trademark is left on all the victims -  the sign of a cross carved on their throats.<br /><br />As I have written in previous reviews, there are many flaws in this series, the major one being the principal character, Francesca Cahill. I don't understand how the author can take a potentially credible, likeable young woman, whom, we are told frequently, is extremely intelligent, independent, etc., and turn her into a silly, immature, indiscreet, and melodramatic personage. Whenever I think Ms. Joyce is catching on with her character development, she has Fran do something simply outlandish, really zany, and it just breaks the mood. Francesca Cahill cannot be Stephanie Plum, not even a more conservative early 20th century sister of Ms. Plum's and still maintain the atmosphere the author wishes to establish. She is a Manhattan socialite in 1902, not a New Jersey bounty hunter in 2005! And, the idea that an upper class young woman would have business cards distributed saying, \\"Francesca Cahill, Crime-Solver Extraordinaire, No. 810 Fifth Avenue, New York City, All Cases Accepted, No Crime Too Small,\\" is ridiculous. Also, the mysteries are filled with too many coincidences to suit my taste.<br /><br />So, why do I keep on reading these books? If you have ever been sick and home from work for a few days, watched the soaps and become addicted to one in particular, you will understand. The strength of Ms. Joyce's novels lies not in the mysteries but rather in her vivid recreation of New York at the turn of the century and her compelling secondary characters. Their stories are ongoing, as are Francesca's and Rick's.<br /><br />Calder Hart, Rick's half brother, wealthy art connoisseur and womanizer, has befriended Francesca and is clearly attracted to her. He is an extremely complex man, and, like his brother, he is illegitimate. Bragg and Hart have different fathers and the same mother. The relationship between these two, their individual lives and backgrounds, are fascinating. Evan Cahill, Francesca's older brother, is another engaging character. He is a smart, caring man, but flawed - with a tendency to gamble and accumulate debts. In fact he has got himself in way over his head and owes a fortune. Andrew Cahill, the family patriarch, a savvy businessman and affectionate father, (pulled himself up by the bootstraps), has agreed to pay off the debts only if Evan agrees to marry a young woman he does not love, nor even care to become better acquainted with. His fiancee has unseen depth, however, and is a brilliant artist, but only Francesca is aware of this. Then there is Constance, the beautiful big sister, married to the very handsome British Lord Neil Montrose, who Francesca has discovered \\"in flagrante\\" with another woman. The clan's maternal force, Julia Cahill, is an extremely strong character determined to marry-off her children well. New characters are introduced in each novel who remain as part of the permanent storyline well after the mystery is solved.<br /><br />The series' premise is a winner - a society girl/college student sleuth in 1902 NYC. There is enough \\"good stuff\\" here to hold my interest, marginally. But I don't have to buy the next book to fulfill my curiosity. I can just go to my local bookstore and skim the narrative over a cup of coffee to discover what will happen between Francesca's sister and her husband, or find out if Evan will break things off with his fiancee. It is up to the author to make her books worth paying money for - although I have now bought three. I will check-out the fourth for improvements before I make the next purchase. My suggestion to potential buyers, take the first book out of the library before you invest your time and money.<br /><br />JANAtionship between these two, their individual lives and backgrounds, are fascinating.

Frank Turner Hollon's \\"The Point of Fracture\\" epitomizes the taut psychological thriller at its best. My adrenaline glands started pumping early on in the novel and the flow didn't let up until I reached the conclusion. I was absolutely riveted by this beautifully written, fast-paced, unputdownable new release by the author of \\"The God File\\" and \\"A Thin Difference.\\"<br /><br />Michael and Suzanne Brace have been married for fifteen years. When the story opens Michael has been sleeping on the couch for a very long time - he prefers it to the guest room. A childless couple, the Braces have become strangers to one another, although he holds dear the memory of the young woman he fell in love with. He clearly retains the image of the girl who drove around with him one night in his \\"blue Volkswagon bug, until the sun came up, completely naked, drinking beer and laughing out loud.\\" And he still believes she exists somewhere inside Suzanne. The reader will learn otherwise.<br /><br />Michael considers himself to be an artist, a writer, and has long believed he has a great novel inside him just waiting to be born. The son of a wealthy family in Fairhope, Alabama, he had the independent means to take the time to test his theory of creativity. A forty hour work week was of no immediate concern. As years passed, however, he became less sure that \\"he could write a decent sentence, much less a novel.\\" Bourbon became a short term solution for writer's block. Now the money situation is getting tight as his savings dwindles. But he finally has something solid. He has written four chapters of what he knows is an exceptionally good narrative. And this is a story he feels compelled to write.<br /><br />Suzanne, still beautiful, suffers from debilitating headaches which leave her temporarily incapacitated. She is also terribly disturbed by childhood memories of violence and abuse. The upside of her physical pain is that it distracts from the emotional pain which is even more crippling. When Suzanne stumbles upon her husband's manuscript and finds that she is the subject of the novel, that Michael has written about dark events she has never discussed with him or anyone else, she feels the rush of a lifetime's rage. And she seeks vicious revenge, conjuring up and carrying out the perfect crime.<br /><br />From the meticulous planning stages of the deed, to its execution, the investigation and the final drama played out in a court of law, this is a page-turner that will disturb and even shock. The prose is vivid and stark, the narrative tight, the characters, major and minor, are complex and well drawn. Hollon builds tension like few other writers. This one is dark and edgy and fine! \\"The Point of Fracture\\" is the first novel I have read by the author, but I certainly intend to remedy that now.

Recently, however, coinciding with newly appointed police commissioner Rick Bragg's move to New York, Francesca has taken to sleuthing....and her grades are suffering as a result.<br /><br />\\"Deadly Love,\\" Brenda Joyce's first mystery in this series, preceding \\"Deadly Pleasure,\\" introduced the cast of characters who people Francesca's life. Miss Cahill also solves her first crime in book one, a child's kidnapping which could have turned lethal, and she begins what seems to be an intense mutual attraction with the extremely charismatic Commissioner Bragg. I panned this first novel, (barely 2 Stars), so many people, including myself, may wonder why on earth I would bother reading this second installment, which is an improvement, but not by much. It is because, although our heroine is silly, (at times beyond belief), immature, indiscreet, and melodramatic, and the mysteries are filled with too many coincidences to suit my taste, the secondary characters are absolutely fascinating. Their ongoing stories do make these books worth reading - very light reading, mind you!<br /><br />Francesca had calling/business cards printed by Tiffany reading, \\"Francesca Cahill, Crime-Solver Extraordinaire, No. 810 Fifth Avenue, New York City, All Cases Accepted, No Crime Too Small.\\" Cute? Not! And she passes these cards out all over town! This is supposedly a brilliant, serious minded young woman of the upper classes, not a merchant's daughter, who wants to keep her sleuthing a secret from her family? I am embarrassed for her and the author.<br /><br />A recipient of one of these Tiffany embossed cards, Miss Georgette de Labouche, leaves a note for Francesca requesting her immediate assistance on a most urgent matter. The matter turns out to be a dead body, the corpse of Miss Labouche's wealthy, longtime lover. The unhappy woman is more concerned with getting rid of the body than with discovering the identity of the killer. Fran sends Joel, the child pickpocket she has hired as an assistant to get the police. Commissioner Bragg is delighted to see Francesca again, but exasperated to find her involved in yet another crime. The attachment between these two continues to develop, but for some reason, Rick is unable to court her or declare his feelings, except as a friend.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the book is the introduction of Rick's half brother, the wealthy rake Calder Hart. Actually the man is much more complex, which is why he is such a compelling figure. Both Rick and Calder are illegitimate, with different fathers and the same mother, and they do not get along at all. The relationship between these two, and their individual lives and backgrounds, are fascinating. Evan Cahill, Francesca's older brother, is another engaging character. He is a smart, caring man, but flawed - with a tendency to gamble and accumulate debts. In fact he has got himself in way over his head and owes a fortune. Andrew Cahill, the family patriarch, a savvy businessman and affectionate father, (pulled himself up by the bootstraps), has agreed to pay off the debts only if Evan agrees to marry a young woman he does not love, nor even care to become better acquainted with. His fiancee has unseen depth, however, and is a brilliant artist, but only Francesca is aware of this.Then there is Constance, the beautiful big sister, married to the very handsome British Lord Neil Montrose, who Francesca has discovered \\"in flagrante\\" with another woman. The clan's maternal force, Julia Cahill, is an extremely strong character determined to marry-off her children well.<br /><br />The series' premise is a winner - a society girl/college student sleuth in 1902 NYC. But Ms. Joyce foundered badly in her first novel and has not improved much here. \\"Deadly Pleasure,\\" the main plot, is not very complex or suspenseful. And PLEASE, if Francesca is supposed to be intelligent, work on her character so that she comes off as a smart young woman with a good head on her shoulders! It seems that more time is spent describing the heroine's wardrobe than developing a suspenseful plot and the principal character. In one instance, the author goes on at length about a peach colored evening gown. On the next page the same dress has mysteriously turned mint green. It seems that Ms. Joyce is churning-out a \\"Deadly series\\" novel 3 times a year. The results are formulaic and sloppy. I get angry because the series has such possibilities. Also, fans of light reading do understand the difference between quality and trash. Never underestimate us!<br /><br />I am still intrigued by the Cahill family and those who touch their lives. Save your time and money with this one. But it is only the second in a series, so perhaps Ms. Joyce will hit her stride. The setting and concept, and certainly the characters, are worth another try. I will let you know after book three - and if there is no great improvement there, I quit!<br /><br />JANAare of this.

Aleut detective Kate Shugak, formerly a gifted investigator for the Anchorage D.A.'s office, moved back to Alaska's far north country after a horrible child abuse case left her scarred physically and emotionally. She now resides on a 160-acre homestead with her half-wolf, half-husky, half-breed canine, Mutt, and makes her living as a private investigator. \\"A Cold Day for Murder,\\" Dana Stabenow's debut mystery in this wonderful series featuring PI Shugak won an Edgar award in 1993.<br /><br />A national park ranger has gone missing in the Alaskan boondocks in the middle of winter, which signifies almost certain death from exposure. It has been more than six weeks since anyone heard from him. The young man's father, a US Congressman, demands that every effort be made to find his son. When the FBI agent assigned to search for the ranger goes missing, Kate Shugak, a native of the area where the two men were last seen, and an expert in Arctic wilderness survival skills, is asked to take the case, she accepts although their trail is now colder than the weather.<br /><br />Dana Stabenow's Kate Shugak novels are consistently good to excellent, and this first one is a real favorite of mine. The author delves into Kate's background, presents some of her family members, spins a thrilling mystery, and touches on the political issues of environmental protection and loss of native cultures that Ms. Shugak holds dear. She also explores the relationship between Jack Morgan, Kate's former boss and lover, and our sleuth heroine.<br /><br />One of the reasons I enjoyed this book so much, and many others in the series, is their Arctic setting and the details of native life and culture. The author's descriptions of the region's physical geography are wonderful. Her characters are original, complex and the dialogue is excellent - full of dark humor. Kate Shugak is super savvy, tough, prickly, and vulnerable, although she hides it well. She has a deep loyalty and abiding love for her people and the land.<br /><br />A terrific read and a winning mystery series!<br />JANAA terrific read and a winning mystery series!   JANA	2005-09-19

Gem cutter Kate Chandler accepts the commission of a lifetime from Arthur McCloud, one of the world's foremost gemstone collectors, who also happens to be the President of the United States' brother-in-law. She does the job brilliantly, as usual, and is able to craft seven exquisitely faceted jewels \\"that burn with an extraordinary blue color,\\" each one a uniquely different shape, from one rough, dull bluish stone. Gems of this deep color and large size are rarely mined nowadays. This particular rough had been in a private collection for over one hundred years. The newly cut stones, collectively called the \\"Seven Sins,\\" assure Kate a major boost in her professional reputation, especially advantageous since her field is comprised primarily of men.<br /><br />Kate's half brother, Lee Mandel, a courier for the family firm, was given the assignment to personally deliver the cut and polished Seven Sins to McCloud at his home on Captiva Island, Florida. A few miles away from his destination, Lee disappeared. So did the stones. Kate, who trusts Lee implicitly, is sure foul play is involved, and that her brother may have been robbed and murdered. Six months after the disappearance, the FBI still believes the foul play is Lee's - that he deliberately stole the gems and took off for parts unknown, a much richer man. Determined to discover the truth, Kate begins her own investigation with a visit to a gem trade show in Scottsdale, Arizona near her home. She is on the lookout for one or more of the seven sapphires she cut. She decides to delve into this mystery despite a death threat she received warning her not to interfere.<br /><br />FBI agent Sam Groves, an outstanding investigator with lousy social and political skills, is in Arizona as part of a special task force looking for a ring of gem thieves. When he sees Kate palm a sapphire, (part of her investigation), he catches her red-handed, so he thinks. She sets him straight real fast. The two eventually work together to solve the mystery surrounding the Seven Sins, Lee Mandel's whereabouts, and to unravel what appears to be a leak inside the task force that has cost the lives of several jewel couriers. The more time Kate and Sam spend together, the stronger their mutual attraction grows.<br /><br />Although \\"The Color of Death,\\" is better than Elizabeth Lowell's last novel or two, it is still formulaic and predictable. There are few, if any, surprises here. The gemstone details, of craft and trade, are absolutely fascinating, and raise the narrative a bit above average.

Bigelow Greene, a twenty six year-old meteorologist from the Midwest, is hired by the Weather Bureau in 1915 and sent to the frontier boomtown of Anchorage, Alaska, to set up an observation station. Unfortunately, due to the department's new budget, the young man barely earns a living wage. He must find additional work to survive life in the harsh Arctic climate, where below freezing temperatures and 20 hour-long winter nights present a major challenge to one's sanity. \\"The Alaskan sun remains unknowable, every day a new prank, pulling along its bows and parhelia and other odd, errant optical paraphernalia, too lazy and distracted to achieve altitude, rolling along the tops of mountains, infusing the icy fog with a strange and sullen greeny glow.\\" In his solitude, Bigelow sees all matter of surreal phenomena from his observatory windows which he would have never before called weather. He questions whether he can survive here. He doesn't think he has mastered the \\"required optimism\\" to do so. Descriptions of the physical world, like the one above, provoke one to wonder whether the landscape is depicted from a real life perspective or from an emotional one, a reflection of Bigelow's inner world?<br /><br />There is a woman, called the Aleut, who lives in a frame house on the mud flats outside of Anchorage. Bigelow becomes obsessed with her. He finds her beautiful. He visits her. They drink tea, share meals, have sex. She bathes. He watches. They never talk. He knows nothing about the woman, about her life, her history, not even her name. Although he speaks to her, he never knows whether she understands him. However, she allows him to watch her \\"as intently, as much and as long, as he wants and the reason for this comes to him one night. She is self-possessed. She possesses herself.\\" This makes him want her all the more. She becomes necessary to him. Then, one morning, she is gone. And he is shattered.<br /><br />Bigelow, begins to drink and look for sexual pleasure with other women, mostly local prostitutes, to ease his pain. He is devastated by the Aleut's disappearance. He temporarily becomes involved with a shopkeeper's daughter, who sings, but is unable to speak. She stammers so violently that she communicates only through written notes. However, his fixation with the missing Inuit woman continues and follows him into his dreams. An introverted, sensitive man, Bigelow does not fit in with the coarser men from town and so he is left virtually alone.<br /><br />The young scientist originally accepted his low paying job because it would give him the opportunity to prove a meteorological theory he had long been obsessed with. He hypothesizes that a great current of air sweeps in a circular fashion from the poles to the equator and back again, causing the air high over the poles to be warm, and the air over the equator cold. His dual obsessions with the meteorological project and with the Aleut woman continually vie for first place in his mind and with his energy. He designs and constructs an enormous kite to take temperature readings thousands of feet above the earth, which will enable him to prove his theory. The kite and his documentation also serve to distract him from his emotional pain and loneliness. The narrative focuses as much on Bigelow's inner obsession with the Aleut woman, as on his professional passion for charting the weather,  with \\"recording a narrative that unfolds invisibly to most people.\\" Unbeknownst to Bigelow, his newfound success with the kite has made a name for him in Anchorage as a scientific innovator. No matter how successful his work is, however, he finds no peace of mind.<br /><br />\\"The Seal Wife,\\" is a finely detailed, well-researched historical fiction that concerns the development of scientific technology before WWI, turn-of-the-century Alaska, and the growth of one man's character. Kathryn Harrison's language is richly metaphorical, especially when she describes the Alaskan landscape as seen through Bigelow's eyes. Her characters, especially the women, are of mythological proportion, more archetypical than three dimensional, and extremely mysterious - although I find Bigelow to be quite realistic. I am a big fan of Ms. Harrison's and while this is an excellent novel, I do prefer her more contemporary work.<br /><br />JANApe as seen through Bigelow's eyes.

For thousands of years, before humans inhabited the earth, an ancient race of magical beings, the Fane or Faerie folk, roamed free in forests and wooded places. With the coming of man, these creatures made themselves invisible, except to animals and others of their kind. There is a magical forest, situated in the north of England, surrounding the estate of Hartsmere in Westmorland. This enchanted wood is ruled and protected by Hern, guardian spirit of the Forests and youngest son of Oberon and Titania. Hern is of the Fane, a near immortal being. He is one of the last of the Elder Race to remain in the world of men and has grown weary of living among mortals. Longing to return to Tir-na-nog, the Blessed Land of his people, he seeks a way to leave the forest he has guarded so well for millennia.<br /><br />The Fane have greatly diminished in number. To save themselves from extinction, each Fane had to steal or sire a half-human child to increase their population and strengthen their bloodline. Hern, the Forest Lord has not yet provided his people with such a child and is commanded to do so before he will be allowed to enter Tir-na-nog.<br /><br />The Fleming family, who own Hartsmere, have prospered for generations. Their health, wealth and prosperity is due to an oath they swore \\"to protect the forest and all its inhabitants from the ravages of mankind.\\"  When Cyrus Fleming, Earl of Bradwell, trespasses upon protected ground and attempts to kill an enormous stag, he is forced to make a bargain with Hern who demands Bradwell give him his daughter or die a terrible death. Fleming agrees, but only if Hern wins his daughter's love.<br /><br />Hern appears to Lady Eden as her distant cousin, Cornelius Fleming, and courts her with so much success that their union is consummated the night before the wedding ceremony. He then reveals himself to her in his natural, non-human, form and she flees in horror. He disappears having achieved his goal. Lady Eden is pregnant with his son. A marriage is quickly arranged for the pregnant Eden, not a difficult task as she is the belle of London's ton. When the child is born, Eden is told the baby died, and the same message is sent to Hern, who is now doomed to remain in the forest. Unbeknownst to either parent, the infant is sent to Ireland to live with foster parents.<br /><br />Eden's husband turns out to be horribly abusive and dies of drink and dissipation five years after their marriage. She returns to Hartsmere an impoverished widow to find her estates in serious decline and her people starving. It is at this time that her boy is returned to her, mysteriously. When Hern learns he has been deceived, he comes looking for the child and revenge.<br /><br />I initially had high hopes for \\"The Forest Lord.\\" I loved fairy tales as a kid and this one, based on Celtic mythology, starts off in a refreshing and original manner; well written and well paced. Then I began to notice some serious discrepancies, especially in Eden's character description and development. The storyline takes a melodramatic turn for the worse about a third of the way through, which is where Ms Krinard began to lose me as an avid reader. Finally, and most annoyingly, the last half of the novel reads like a story in search of a conclusion.

She lives in a Fifth Avenue mansion, with her parents and older brother, attends glittering society balls and fundraisers, and allows herself, occasionally, to be courted by the town's most eligible bachelors. However, she is a marginal player, at best, in the comings and goings of Manhattan's rich and famous, to her mother's dismay. Francesca is extremely bright and is determined to do something with her mind other than plan dinner parties. Unbeknownst to her mother, she has enrolled in Barnard College with aspirations to become a journalist. Fran is also active in major societal reform movements, especially the Ladies Society for the Eradication of Tenements.<br /><br />At one of her mother's numerous parties, she is introduced to newly appointed police commissioner, Rick Bragg. As they spar about local politics, he takes note that the lovely young women has the proverbial brains as well as beauty. She notices that he's not so bad himself. Later in the evening, she goes into her father's library to take a breather and finds an unopened note on top of the mail, marked URGENT, but not addressed to anyone in particular. So she opens it and reads, \\"A is for Ants.

Francesca, who begins as an interesting young woman, winds-up an airhead. And she is supposedly intelligent! She bumbles as badly, at times, as Bragg's police, forerunners of the Keystone Cops.

Hope belongs to life, it's life defending itself."	It has taken me years to sit down and finally make a serious commitment to read Julio Cortazar's \\"Hopscotch/La Rayuela.\\" I cannot think of a better companion to devote a few weeks to, maybe even longer - hey, whatever it takes! It depends on your reading speed and the time you take to truly savor the poetry of the author's language. So, be willing to make a small personal investment in this very special novel, and the reward you reap will be a worthy one. Julio Cortazar will take you to places you have never been before in literature, and may never experience again. I read \\"Hopscotch\\" over this past summer, after a thirty year delay. I can be very stubborn about putting off what is good for me!! The author's imagination is boundless, his prose rich and luminous, his wit and sophistication rare, the dialogue brilliant, the plot...I won't attempt to describe that with a few adjectives. Wander through the extraordinary labyrinthine plot on you own - the way is yours to discover. I promise, you won't get lost!<br /><br />I was introduced to \\"La Rayuela\\" about thirty years ago, when a close friend, with similar reading tastes, gave me the book. Enthused after just reading the novel, he told me that I reminded him of one of the characters, La Maga. (What a compliment...I think!). I was living in Latin America at the time. With personal interests at stake and much curiosity, I bought a copy in Spanish, which I read with some fluency back then. After experimenting with which way to approach the novel, and trying both ways, I gave up...and just read the parts about La Maga. I had little patience at that point in my life, and needed to acquire some, and to read slower, with more of a sense of play and participation. Cortazar wants his readers to participate - to make reading his book an interactive experience, not a passive one. I was and still feel touched when I remember my friend's comments regarding La Maga. She is a magnificent character and Cortazer's prose, his language, (Spanish), is exquisite. So, about a year later, I thought I'd give it another try, in English, perhaps with better results. None! I just wasn't ready, I guess. That happens to me with fiction occasionally. I have to be open to the experience. Yet, after all these years, I still thought of Horacio Oliveira and La Maga from time to time. And why not? They are truly unforgettable. As I wrote above, I did make time, at last. For an adventure of a lifetime, I recommend you do the same.<br /><br />When Julio Cortazar published \\"La Rayuela\\" in 1966, he turned the conventional novel upside-down and the literary world on its ear with this experiment in writing fiction. He soon became an important influence on writers everywhere. \\"Hopscotch\\" is considered to be one of the best novels written in Spanish. The work is interactive, where readers are invited to rearrange its text and read sections in different sequences. Read in a linear fashion, \\"Hopscotch\\" contains 700 pages, 155 chapters in three sections: \\"From the Other Side,\\" and \\"From This Side\\" - the first two sections are sustained by relatively chronological narratives and so contrast greatly with the third section, \\"From Diverse Sides,\\" (subtitled \\"Expendable Chapters\\"), which includes philosophical extrapolation, character study, allusions and quotations, and an entirely different version of the \\"ending.\\"<br /><br />The book has no table of contents, but rather a \\"Table of Instructions.\\" There, we learn that two approved readings are possible: from Chapter 1 through 56 \\"in a normal fashion\\", or from Chapter 73 to Chapter 1 to... well, wherever the chapters lead you. The instructions are all in your book and are extremely clear. At the end of each chapter there is a numeric indicator to lead the reader to the next chapter. One never knows where one will be lead. Due to its meandering nature, \\"Hopscotch\\" has been called a \\"Proto-hypertext\\" novel. Cort&aacute;zar probably had this work in mind when he stated, \\"If I had the technical means to print my own books, I think I would keep on producing collage-books.\\"<br /><br />Horacio Oliveira, our protagonist and sometimes narrator, is an Argentinean expatriate, an intellectual and professed writer in 1950's bohemian Paris. He and his close friends, members of \\"the Club,\\" do lots of partying, drinking, and intellectualizing, discussing art, literature, music and solving the world's problems. Oliveira lives with and loves La Maga, an exotic young woman, somewhat whimsical, at times almost ephemeral, who leaves behind her, like the scent of a light perfume, a feeling of poignancy and inevitable loss. La Maga refuses to plan her encounters with Oliveira in advance, preferring instead to run into each other by chance. Then she and Oliveira celebrate the series of circumstances that reunite them. Eventually, he loses La Maga, who loses her child. With her absence, Oliveira realizes how empty and meaningless his life is and he returns to his native Buenos Aires. There he finds work first as a salesman, then a keeper of a circus cat, and an attendant in an insane asylum.<br /><br />As Oliveira wends his way through France, Uruguay and Argentina looking for his lost love, \\"Hopscotch's\\" narrative takes on an emotionally intense stream of consciousness style, rich in metaphor. Back In Argentina, Oliveira shares his life with his bizarre double, Traveler, and Traveler's wife, Talita, whom Oliveira attempts to remake into a facsimile of La Maga.<br /><br />The game of hopscotch is only developed as a conceit late in the narrative. It is first used to describe Oliveira's confused love for La Maga as \\"that crazy hopscotch.\\" The theme develops as a metaphor for reaching Heaven from Earth. \\"When practically no one has learned how to make the pebble climb into Heaven, childhood is over all of a sudden and you're into novels, into the anguish of the senseless divine trajectory, into the speculation about another Heaven that you have to learn to reach too.\\" The variations on the children's game are described as \\"spiral hopscotch, rectangular hopscotch, fantasy hopscotch, not played very often.\\" The allusions continue and include some beautiful passages.<br /><br />\\"Hopscotch\\" is much more than a novel. Ultimately, it is best left for each reader to define what it is for himself/herself. Pablo Neruda in a famous quote said, \\"People who do not read Cortazar are doomed. Not to read him is a serious invisible disease.\\" I don't know whether I would go so far. Remember, I put off the experience for many years. But this is one novel that should be read during one's lifetime. It is brilliant and it is fun!<br /><br />JANAhad the technical means to print my own books, I think I would keep on producing collage-books.\\"  <br /> <br />Horacio Oliveira, our protagonist and sometimes narrator, is an Argentinean expatriate, an intellectual and professed writer in 1950's bohemian Paris.

In this dissertation on women and literature, she discusses the various obstacles facing women involved in the creative process, and stresses the importance of financial and social independence for females. I think this is probably my favorite essay by the author, and one of her finest, most accessible pieces of writing. It is important to note that her interests did not lie particularly in the areas of politics and feminism, but solely on art itself and the freedom to create it.<br /><br />Ms. Woolf argues that the reason there were so few prominent, highly respected women authors before the twentieth century is because most women had not led lives conducive to creating great art or literature. She posits that there was no actual body of notable women's literature because, in the past, women did not have the education, the income, the privacy, the experiences of travel to broaden their world, or the time to write. Dominated by men throughout history, females have been denied access to education, independent travel, and to publication. Without an independent income, women are totally dependent upon men.<br /><br />Women are responsible for bearing children, and in almost all cases have the primary responsibility for bringing them up. Few have the luxury of hired help. Although rewarding in many way, child rearing allows for little privacy, independence and solitude, prerequisite conditions for writing, painting or composing. If privacy is non-existent, interruptions block creativity. Ms. Woolf clearly states that what a woman needs is a room of her own and a guaranteed fixed income in order to write noteworthy fiction. Here she challenges women to become economically self-sufficient in order to acquire the necessary intellectual freedom to create outstanding literature. Virginia Woolf believed that the remarkable, the momentous, could be found amongst the mundane details and occurrences of everyday life. She encourages women to write about all of the \\"minutely obscure lives\\" which men have ignored, and about themselves, their feelings and their reactions to the world around them. I believe the author's great novel, \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" reflects this mindset.<br /><br />Aphra Behn, (1640 - 1689), was the first female writer to earn her own income from writing. After John Dryden, she was the most prolific dramatist of the Restoration. However, she achieved her place in literary history for her pioneering work in prose narrative. Ms. Behn paved the way for 19th century novelists like Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Bronte sisters, who were able to write in their family sitting-rooms or libraries, despite their lack of independence and privacy. Woolf wrote/spoke: \\"All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn, which is, most scandalously but rather appropriately, in Westminster Abbey, for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds. It is she - shady and amorous as she was - who makes it not quite fantastic for me to say to you tonight: Earn five hundred a year by your wits.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Woolf quotes Sir Arthur Quiller-Coach, a Professor of Literature who wrote: \\"The poor poet has not in these days, nor has had for two hundred years, a dog's chance...a poor child in England has little more hope than had the son of an Athenian slave to be emancipated into that intellectual freedom of which great writings are born.\\" Ms Woolf goes on to state that obviously this noted professor believes that intellectual freedom depends upon material things. \\"Poetry depends upon intellectual freedom. And women have always been poor, not for two hundred years merely, but from the beginning of time. Women have had less intellectual freedom than the sons of Athenian slaves. Women, then, have not had a dog's chance of writing poetry. That is why I have laid so much stress on money and a room of one's own.\\"<br /><br />A good part of \\"A Room of One's Own\\" analyzes the patriarchal British society that so limited a woman's opportunities. Woolf theorized that while male authors write about women and allow their heroines to \\"shine like beacons\\" in fiction, in reality women were often treated like slaves, not free to choose their own mates, and frequently beaten by their husbands and fathers. She goes on to say that men historically belittle women as a means of asserting their own superiority. She uses the metaphor of a looking-glass relationship, men, threatened by the thought of losing their power, need to reduce women to enlarge themselves.<br /><br />The androgynous ideal, the writer with an androgynous mind, where a writer uses both parts of the brain equally, is also championed here. \\"The androgynous mind is resonant and porous; it transmits emotion without impediment; it is naturally creative, incandescent and undivided.\\" This is a fascinating proposition which Woolf explored more fully in her 1928 novel \\"Orlando,\\" a fantasy set in the Elizabethan court, tracing the career of the androgynous protagonist from a masculine identity to a feminine identity.<br /><br />Woolf constructed this essay as a partly-fictionalized narrative to make her points vividly. She invents an imaginary female narrator, a talented contemporary novelist of some potential. Unfortunately,  because she lacks models and a tradition to draw on, our narrator is a hundred years away from being able to develop her gifts fully, to \\"be a poet.\\"  A fictional historic character is introduced, Miss Judith Shakespeare, the very gifted sibling of Will, in order to illustrate the sorry fate of highly intelligent, creative women in the past. This device is extremely effective in bringing home the difficulties of talented women living in the traditional world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this extraordinary long essay to both men and women - to everyone interested in the creative process. It is a brilliantly written, perceptive thesis.<br /><br />JANAve not had a dog's chance of writing poetry.

Wilkie Collins' suspense thriller \\"Armadale\\" contains no less than four main characters, named Allen Armadale - two fathers, each with a single son and heir. Only one Allen Armadale, however, is the rightful owner of the estate, Thorpe-Ambrose, plus a fortune in pounds sterling, and title to land and wealth in Barbados, West Indies. Although the plot sounds convoluted, if only by containing so many characters of the same name, I have to say this is compelling reading at its best, and the narrative is extremely understandable and well paced. The author is a master storyteller.<br /><br />Allen Armadale, (let's call him #2), makes a death bed confession in 1832, at the Swiss health resort of Wildbad. The only English speaker available to document the dying man's final words is a Scot, Mr. Neal. This shocking written disclosure is then mailed to Armadale's executors to be given to his infant son, (Allen Armadale #3), when he comes of age.<br /><br />Armadale, (#2), nee Wrentmore, was born in Barbados and upon turning twenty-one he received a surprise inheritance from his godfather, a Mr. Armadale, of Thorpe-Ambrose in Norfolk, England. The young man would become the owner of his godfather's considerable Barbadian estate on the condition that he change his name to match that of his benefactor. It was thus that Allen Wrentmore became Allen Armadale, the largest proprietor and wealthiest man on Barbados. The elder Armadale had just disinherited his own profligate son, Allen Armadale #1. The infamous son, going by the pseudonym Fergus Ingleby, turns up in Barbados shortly thereafter and befriends his distant cousin, the newest addition to the Armadale line. The consequences of this relationship are dire.<br /><br />Years later, another pair of Armadale men (#3 and #4), both in their early twenties, meet and become the best of friends. Although each has been warned never to come into contact with the other, there is, initially, no way for them to recognize each other's true identities. As with their forefathers, a generation before, a pseudonym is involved here. Unlike their fathers, however, both are totally innocent of malicious intent.<br /><br />All four Allen Armadales are connected by the most enigmatic, fascinating villainess that I know of in literature, Lydia Gwilt - although her name leaves much to be desired aesthetically. Miss Gwilt, perhaps fiction's first femme fatale, is a beautiful, sensual, flame-haired temptress. She is also a bigamist, dope addict, forger, and murderess....at the very least, and probably the book's most intelligent personage. Her intrigues drive the plot of this gripping drama: a tale of murder, espionage, counter-espionage, criminal fraud, adultery, inescapable destiny, romantic rivalries, confused identities, innumerable secrets and lies. Also included in the storyline is a chilling portrait of an abortionist with a bizarre clinic, which he utilizes with lethal intent. Amazingly, Mr Collins' book was published in 1866...and we complain about too much crime and violence in today's entertainment! A book reviewer of the period wrote of Lydia Gwilt in the \\"The Athenaeum,\\" (1866), \\"One of the most hardened female villains whose devices and desires have ever blackened fiction.\\" I find that none of Collins' characters are all good or all bad, though, and Miss Gwilt certainly earned my sympathy on more than one occasion. The author's three dimensional characters are just one of the many reasons \\"Armadale\\" is such an addictive read.<br /><br />Collins controls complex plots and subplots with seeming ease. He focuses on the question of fate as opposed to free will. Are our destinies predetermined or can they be altered? One of the main characters fights relentlessly against what he is convinced is his fate. At other times, he seems reconciled to it. The novel also introduces the first private detective that I know of in fiction, in the person of Mr. Bashwood - certainly no model for Sherlock Holmes, Sam Spade or Mike Hammer.<br /><br />Wilkie Collins was a close friend of Charles Dickens, and they both serialized their popular fiction, called 'sensation novels' by many. The nineteenth-century Victorian serial novel allowed authors to make a single story last for years, like today's most popular soap operas. This type of fiction was much more topical, and targeted a wider audience than our soaps, however. The history of the serial gives an understanding of how important writers like Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins were to serial publication and how important serial publication was to nineteenth-century readers. Other popular episode writers of the time were Alexander Dumas, Anthony Trollope, George Eliot, William M. Thackeray, etc.. Wilkie Collins, called master of the cliff-hanger is famously quoted for saying: \\"Make 'em cry, make 'em laugh, make 'em wait - exactly in that order.\\"<br /><br />A recently discovered interview with Wilkie Collins reveals that \\"Armadale\\" was his own favorite among his works. I have read both \\"The Woman in White\\" and \\"The Moonstone\\" and found them to be exceptional, really great reads. \\"Armadale\\" may be the best of the three. I was absolutely riveted. Highly recommended!<br />JANAs a close friend of Charles Dickens, and they both serialized their popular fiction, called 'sensation novels' by many.

While driving his family through Mexico, he had a veritable brainstorm. He remembered his grandmother's storytelling technique - to recall fantastic, improbable events as if they had actually happened - literally. That was the key to recounting the life of the imaginary village of Macondo and her inhabitants. He turned the car around and drove back home to begin \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" anew. To my mind it is one of the 20th century's best works of fiction, and was highlighted in the citation awarding Garcia Marquez the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature.<br /><br />\\"Living to Tell The Tale\\" relates the early years of the author's life, although some of the book's most important incidents predate Garcia Marquez's birth. The impact of these experiences, the people and their stories, were to have a powerful effect on him, as a man and as a writer. This is the tale of his parents' courtship, marriage and the birth of their children, Garcia Marquez, (Gabito), the oldest, and his ten siblings. It tells of his early years which were spent in Aracataca, in the home of his maternal grandparents. His grandfather, Colonel Nicol&aacute;s Ricardo M&aacute;rquez Mej&iacute;a, was a Liberal veteran of the War of a Thousand Days. He was supposedly a storyteller of great repute. The Colonel told his young grandson that there was no greater burden than to have killed a man. Later Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez would put these words into the mouths of his characters. His grandmother, Tranquilina Iguar&aacute;n Cotes, had a major influence on Gabriel's life also. Another great source of stories, her mind was filled with superstitions and folklore, and she gossiped away with her numerous sisters within hearing range of young \\"Gabito.\\" No matter how fantastic her statements, she always delivered them as if they were the absolute, verifiable truth. This was the style which was to effect Garcia Marquez's fiction, sometimes called \\"magical realism.\\" These women filled the house with stories of ghosts, premonitions and omens - all of which were studiously ignored by her husband. He had little interest in \\"women's beliefs.\\"<br /><br />Aracataca was a small village, a banana town on the Caribbean coast, where poverty was the norm and violence was an everyday occurrence. On December 6, 1928, in the Cienaga train station, near Aracataca, 3,000 striking banana workers were shot and killed by troops from Antioquia. Although still a baby, this event, recounted to him, was to have a profound effect on the author. The incident was officially forgotten and omitted from Colombian history textbooks.<br /><br />In 1940, when he was twelve, Gabo was awarded a scholarship to a secondary school for gifted students, run by Jesuits. The school, the Liceo Nacional, was in Zipaquir&aacute;, a city 30 miles to the north of Bogot&aacute;. It was during his school years, 1940s and 50s, that he was first drawn to poetry - a national obsession in Colombia. Verse was revered as an art form, and also as an effective means of social and political commentary. He and his friends, fellow students, would read aloud and discuss poetry late into the night. The youths admired a group of poets called the piedra y cielo (\\"stone and sky\\") and they were strongly influenced by Juan Ramon Jimenez and Pablo Neruda. Too poor to buy his own books, Gabo would devour novels borrowed from friends.<br /><br />While still a boy, he decided he wanted to be a writer. The people who surrounded him in his childhood later became instrumental when developing the characters and the storylines for his novels. \\"Love In The Time of Cholera\\"was inspired by the romance between his mother and father. And his grandfather, who had twelve children, (some say 16), by two different women, became Colonel Aureliano Buendia in \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\\"<br /><br />One of the most powerful episodes of the book tells of the period called \\"La Violencia.\\" In 1948 the Liberal presidential candidate, Jorge Eliecer Gaitan, was assassinated. The murder led to rioting, and left approximately 2500 dead on the streets of Bogota, during \\"el Bogot&aacute;zo.\\" Political violence and repression followed. One of the buildings that burned was the pension where Garcia Marquez lived, and his manuscripts were destroyed along with his living quarters. The National University was closed and he was forced to go to the university in Cartagena. Garcia Marquez began his career as a journalist, writing stories and commentary for a Liberal newspaper in Cartegana. Later he moved to the coastal city of Barranquilla where he began to associate with a group of young writers who admired modernists like Joyce, Woolf and Hemingway, and introduced Marquez to Faulkner. In 1954 he returned to Bogota, as a reporter for El Espectador.<br /><br />Garcia Marquez begins his book, however, not with his real birth in 1928, but with his \\"birth as a writer,\\" at age 22. He and his mother took a trip from Baranquilla, where he was working as a reporter, to his childhood home in Aracataca, now virtually a ghost town. They were going to sell the ancestral house. Vivid memories were stirred up here, memories which electrified his imagination. This trip was to change the course of his writing life. \\"With the first step I took onto the burning sands of the town, Aracataca instantly became Macondo, an earthly paradise of desolation and nostalgia.\\" His one great subject became his family, \\"which was never the protagonist of anything, but only a witness to and victim of everything.\\" His is not a chronological autobiography. Garcia Marquez cuts back and forth through time to show how memory colors experience. As he says in the book's epigraph, \\"Life is not what one lived, but what one remembers and how one remembers it in order to recount it.\\"<br /><br />Humor, dry wit, a sense of the absurd, is a trademark throughout the novels of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and this autobiography is full of his deadpan humor. His anecdotes of his many mistresses and cafe society are wonderful. \\"Living To Tell The Tale\\" is not a conventional literary memoir. It is a magical combination of memoir and national history written in the author's remarkable voice. It is his personal mythology, from the repertoire which birthed Macondo. The narrative is intimate and sincere, filled with bewitching details and descriptions. In spite of poverty, and the political turmoil so prevalent in Colombia during his lifetime, Gabo acknowledges his early years were filled with joy, a sense of well-being and encouragement from many people. Garcia Marquez leaves us, at the end of this volume, with a glimpse of his future love, his wife, \\"\\"wearing a green dress with golden lace in that year's style, her hair cut like swallows' wings, and with the intense stillness of someone waiting for a person who will not arrive.\\"<br /><br />Bravo Gabriel Garcia Marquez!!<br /><br />JANAher and father.

Although this novel, and the entire quartet, have been classified as children's books, I do not totally agree with the label or classification. The tales may well be appreciated by children and adults alike, but the sophisticated prose, the very language used to form the riveting narratives, is as rich and flavorful as dark Belgian chocolate. And apart from the obvious storylines, there are subtexts, subplots and subtleties. One could say that Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" or \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" by Jonathan Swift, are delightful children's books, however, these same novels are usually appreciated by adults on an entirely different level.<br /><br />\\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" introduces the main character of the series, Ged, a little boy who discovers he has magical ability. He studies under Ogion the Silent, the great mage of Re Albi, learning to read and write the Six Hundred Runes of Hardic. Ged discovers he has developed the power to call animals. However, he is tempted by magic clearly forbidden to one so inexperienced, and makes a terrible mistake. From this incident, Ged and Ogion learn that he has become too powerful at too young an age and is not able to control the magic within. The boy decides to leave his beloved mentor and travel to Roke Island and the School (for sorcery).<br /><br />He studies under the Archmage Nemmerle, Warder of Roke and the nine Masters of Roke. Ged's arrogance and carelessness lead him to show off to impress the other boys. He accepts a dare to call up a spirit and instead releases a mysterious, evil shadow from beyond this world. The experience nearly kills him. This time the consequences are truly horrific and will have a lasting effect on his life.<br /><br />When he recovers, he finishes his studies and is hired by the residents of Pendor to protect them from a dragon that has menaced them for years. While he lives there he is haunted and tormented by the evil shadow, and finally realizes that he must go after it instead of trying to hide. In order to fulfill his obligation to the townsfolk of Pendor he goes out to meet their dragon instead of waiting for it to come to him. Only then will he go in search of the shadow.<br /><br />The tale of the \\"Tombs of Atuan,\\" is the second book in the Earthsea Cycle and begins a few years after Ged's adventures combating the \\"shadow\\" force. In Atuan, part of the Kargish lands, a little girl, Tenar, is chosen at birth to assume the role of One Priestess of the Tombs of Atuan, where the ancient Nameless Ones are said to dwell. When Tenar turns five years-old, she is taken from her parents and formerly given to the Nameless Ones, her life until death is dedicated to them - the old gods. She is schooled to become the High Priestess, reborn, of an ancient religion. And from this time she will have no other name but Arha, the Eaten One. While, in Atuan's tombs, she discovers an intruder in the forbidden labyrinth. This man offers the young woman a wider destiny if she wishes it. She chooses to turn her back on everything familiar, in exchange for an uncertain future.<br /><br />Something is leaching the magic, mystery and all the joy out of Earthsea. The world's Balance has been disrupted. Arren, the young prince of Enlad, heir to the Principality of Morred, joins Ged, (now Archmage), on a quest to find the source of the evil. Their search will take them to the open sea to visit with the raft people, and then across the wall into the dry land of the dead. \\"The Farthest Shore,\\" the third novel, is my favorite. Ged's and Arren's commitment to prevent their world from falling apart, is inspiring and often extremely moving.<br /><br />In this book we learn that it is now time for a king to sit on the throne of Earthsea again, to wield the Sign of Peace and unite the lands and peoples. However, a prophecy must be fulfilled first: \\"He shall inherit my throne who has crossed the dark land living and come to the far shores of the day.\\" Ged insists on taking action before any more discussion takes place about kings and future. He would go where the trouble is now, with Arren, to find the source of the blight. They must find and close the hole in the world where the light is bleeding out.<br /><br />\\"Tehanu,\\" the fourth and final book, was written twenty years after publication of \\"The Farthest Shore.\\" Ms. Le Guin returns to Earthsea, and to Gont, to chronicle Ged's life after he ceases to be Archmage, and to reunite him with Tenar. A new power and another champion of Balance, Tehanu/Therru, is also introduced here. Tenar's reflections on her life, the nature of a woman's power and her own place in the world are major themes in the novel. Although \\"Tehanu\\" stands on its own, as do the other books in the Earthsea series, the story will be more enjoyable if the previous books are read first.<br /><br />Ms Le Guin examines many topics in these extraordinary novels. To me one of the most interesting is the delicate balance between life and death. The author focuses on the importance of death and how its inevitability makes life more meaningful. Her approach is influenced by eastern philosophy. The eternal cycle of life, death, the return of the body to the earth, and one's energy to the universe, is part of the natural world which maintains the equilibrium of our planet.<br /><br />Ms. Le Guin's prose is, quite simply, exquisite.

Powerful and moving, \\"The Mill on the Floss\\" is considered to be George Eliot's most autobiographical novel. Along with \\"Middlemarch\\" it is my favorite. Set in early 19th century England - St. Ogg's, Lincolnshire to be exact - this is the tale of gifted, free-spirited Maggie Tulliver and her selfish, spoiled brother, Tom, who were born and raised at Dorlcote Mill on the River Floss. Eliot's portrayal of sibling relationships is terribly poignant and plays a major part in the novel, as does the longstanding rivalry between two local families - the Tullivers and the Wakems.<br /><br />From earliest childhood Maggie worships her brother Tom, and longs to win his approval, and that of her parents. However, her fierce intelligence and strong streak of independence bring her into constant conflict with her family. She finds, in literature, the kindness and love she longs for in life. \\"...everybody in the world seemed so hard and unkind to Maggie: there was no indulgence, no fondness, such as she imagined when she fashioned the world afresh in her own thoughts. In books there were people who were always agreeable or tender, and delighted to do things that made one happy, and who did not show their kindness by finding fault. The world outside the books was not a happy one Maggie felt. If life had no love in it, what else was there for Maggie?\\" Her nature, complex, passionate, sensuous, noble, intellectualized, and spiritualized, is of great importance to this novel, as is the pathos of her relationship with Tom.<br /><br />Maggie's early years are brilliantly and unsentimentally portrayed from a child's perspective. The author structures a sequence of childhood's phases, which might appear, at first, to be random vignettes, but constitute an excellent psychological basis on which to build a character and motivation. Eliot once stated, \\"my stories always grow out of my psychological conception of the dramatis personae.\\" Thus, the author chronicles Maggie's life as she grows from a precocious little girl to a strikingly attractive young woman, tall with full lips, and a \\"crown\\" of jet black hair. Her lack of social pretension makes her even more charming and likeable. As she matures, her conflicts with her brother, her family, even with her community, increase significantly. She, herself, feels torn between what is considered her \\"moral responsibility\\" and her search for self-fulfillment. Ultimately, she demonstrates honor and courage in the face of the disapproval of a narrow, tradition-bound society.<br /><br />Parallel to, and intertwined with Maggie's story, is that of families Tullivur and Wakem. After Tullivur loses his mill and social respectability through bankruptcy, (a loss precipitated by a rash lawsuit he undertook), Wakem purchases it all. Mr. Tullivur agrees to stay on as manager. At first he seems resigned to his misfortune. However, within the space of a few pages he is swearing vengeance on the new owner and cursing him. He actually summons Tom to inscribe his curse on Wakem in the family Bible, and makes his son swear to uphold it. The feud becomes violent when Wakem, in the role of proprietor, appropriately corrects Tullivur's management of the mill. Of course the criticism is taken as an insult, and shortly afterward, upon meeting his boss on the road, Tullivur horsewhips him in \\"a frenzy of triumphant vengeance.\\" Tom sees this uncontrolled outbreak of madness as the result of long repressed hatred. Mr. Tullivur never repents his beating of Wakem. His injured pride and sense of righteous indignation, justify him in his own mind. This lack of forgiveness is also demonstrated by Tom for his sister. In direct contrast, Maggie couples love with forgiveness.<br /><br />As she reaches adulthood, Maggie finds herself torn between her relationships with three extremely different men: her proud, stubborn brother, Tom; Philip Wakem, a beloved friend who is also the son of her family's worst enemy; and a charismatic but unacceptable suitor. When Tom is thrown suddenly into the role of adult, after his father's death, he becomes obsessed with acquiring social status and power. He attempts to arrange a socially advantageous marriage for Maggie, and when she refuses, he severs ties with her.<br /><br />I won't spoil your read with any further discussion of the novel's details, especially the dramatic conclusion. George Eliot writes with a keen sense of humor, especially when addressing the grotesque in the human character. Her narrative has great depth, as insight to character and social observations are more important to Eliot than pace and action. \\"The Mill On The Floss\\" is deeply romantic - a work of great beauty and a literary classic. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />\\"The Mill On The Floss\\" is based partially on Eliot's, (born Mary Ann Evans), own experiences with her family and her brother Isaac, who was three years older than she. Eliot's father, like Mr. Tulliver, was a businessman who had married a woman from a higher social class. His wife's sisters were rich, ultra-respectable, and self-satisfied. These maternal aunts provided the character models for the aunts in the novel. Like Maggie, Eliot was extremely intelligent, energetic, imaginative and unconventional. She did not fit traditional models of feminine beauty or behavior, causing her family a great deal of consternation. Eliot lived with a man who she had not married - a daring enterprise in Victorian England. By the time this novel was published, she had gained considerable notoriety as an \\"immoral woman.\\"<br /><br />This edition has been edited by Gordon S.

Word had reached his kingdom from other points in Earthsea, and he and his father had begun to notice signs of this malaise in their own land. Sorcerers, mages, witches and chanters, no longer remember their spells, nor are they able to sing their songs. The names of things are on the verge of being forgotten. Wizards are being maimed and killed in some places. Men and women who have long depended on magic to enrich their lives, seem not to care at all anymore. Roke is \\"defended,\\" invulnerable, protecting the Masters from harm, so the prince's warning is the first heard on the Island.<br /><br />Ged, now the Archmage: the greatest wizard of all Earthsea; \\"the man who had capped the Black Well of Fundaur and won the ring of Erreth-Akbe from the Tombs of Atuan and built the deep founded sea wall of Nepp; the sailor who knew the seas from Astowell to Selidor; the only living Dragonlord,\\" confers urgently with the other Masters. They know the Balance has been disrupted. Whatever balance remains, now resides in Roke when it should lie in the hands of a king. Eighteen years before, the Ring of the King's Rune was returned to its rightful place. This deed improved the world for a while, but it did not bring oneness. There has been no king on the high throne in Havnor for 800 years. Now a king must sit on the throne of Earthsea again, to wield the Sign of Peace and unite the lands and peoples. However, a prophecy must be fulfilled first: \\"He shall inherit my throne who has crossed the dark land living and come to the far shores of the day.\\" Ged insists on taking action before any more discussion takes place about kings and future. He would go where the trouble is now, immediately, to find the source of the blight. He must find and close the hole in the world that is leeching out the light. Ged will take one companion with him, Arren.<br /><br />As the two sail south and then west, they discover decay, decline, darkness, forgetfulness.

That woman, Clarissa Dalloway, is the upper-middle class wife of Richard Dalloway, an affluent Member of Parliament. As the day begins, Clarissa, buys flowers for a dinner party she plans to give that evening, where prominent society guests and political figures will mingle, engaging in same banal conversation and banter as always. Clarissa is renowned as a hostess in London society, an asset to her husband.<br /><br />When Peter Walsh, a man she hasn't seen for thirty years, pays her a surprise visit, her thoughts take her back to the summer of 1890. She reflects on the choices she made as a young woman and how they shaped her life and effected her as a person.<br /><br />Juxtaposed upon Clarissa's story, her character and elite social position, is that of Septimus Warren Smith, a shell-shocked veteran of the First World War. While the prosperous Mrs. Dalloway purchases her flowers, Septimus sits in Regent's Park listening to the sparrows sing to him, in what he believes is Greek. He is still young, though shattered in spirit. Septimus is poor with few resources to improve his health or position in life. Yet the two individuals share common fears. Toward the end of the book, their lives intersect, for just a moment in time.<br /><br />Ms. Woolf uses flashbacks as a method to broaden the novel's timeframe from a day to a lifetime. She employs stream-of-consciousness, a relatively new literary device back then, to allow her characters' thoughts to travel back and forth in time, reflecting their emotions, and enriching them tremendously as complex personages. In literature, there are relatively few characters who approach the memorable Mrs. Dalloway in depth. The author believed that the remarkable, the momentous, could be found amongst the mundane details and occurrences of everyday life. Characters are tied together by time's thread, weaving a tapestry through the years. In the novel, Big Ben marks the passage of time, booming out the hour, a reminder that precious moments of life are passing as it tolls.<br /><br />Virginia Woolf is one of the most talented and noteworthy literary figures of the twentieth century. She is renowned as an innovative novelist, especially for her contribution to the development of the stream-of-consciousness narrative technique. Her prose is some of the most poetic I have ever read and her character development, especially in \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" is superb.

A trusted athletics coach seduces an innocent minor in his charge, resulting in a pregnancy, the birth of a daughter, a marriage built on a lie, and secrets which eventually taint the lives of many people in Ottawa Valley's Deep River community, especially members of the LeBlanc and Halliwell families. These deceptions, the very act which made them necessary, will cause death, disappearance and despair beyond measure.<br /><br />Sixteen year-old Kay Clancy is an \\"aspiring, teenaged gymnast of uncommon talent\\" getting ready to compete for a spot on the Canadian team headed for the 1960 Rome Olympics. However, her dreams are dashed when she becomes pregnant by her coach, a man more than twice her age with a lovely wife and child of his own. Shortly after her disquieting discovery, Kay falls in love. She literally flips off the school's trampoline right into Joseph Patrice Emmanuel Francois Gabriel LeBlanc's \\"Herculean arms.\\" Kay believes it is love at first sight for both of them, but Joe had seen her before, so he loved her earlier. When Kay confesses her pregnancy, but not the identity of the father, Joe disappears. He returns, however, months later, in time to claim Kay for his wife and baby Estelle as his first born.<br /><br />What follows are happy years for the LeBlancs. Baby Louis arrives on the scene not long after Estelle. And Margaret, (called Margar), is about to be born when tragedy strikes and Joe disappears again. He is last seen portaging his canoe toward the nearby river. Years later, when all have given up hope of finding him or his remains, (except for Louis, Margar and his LeBlanc uncles), Joe's disintegrating canoe paddle is found, along with a canoe 'thwart,' underneath the dock in front of the Halliwell home, where the coach lives with his emotionally fragile wife, Marie, and their son, Eddie. Margar LeBlanc, the only one of Joe's three children never to see him, longs to do so. The mischievous and very curious girl is frequently drawn to the Halliwell home, by the river. What she will eventually find there will alter her forever.<br /><br />This beautifully written and complex story is framed by the quadrennial Summer Olympiads, from Rome in 1960 to Moscow in 1980, and oddly enough, it is also interspersed with sitings of the Trudeau family, debonair Premier Pierre, his wife Margaret and their three sons. I grew up in this time period and was a fan of Canada's first family, as well as the Summer Games, so it makes sense to me. It also gives me a vivid sense of the period and setting.<br /><br />Kristen Den Hartog's characters, especially the children, really leap off the page. She captures them in telling moments of joy, sorrow and fear with remarkable eloquence. Ms. Den Hartog describes with tremendous poignancy a child's longing for a lost parent, a hero figure - \\"Margar never knew her dad, but because she was always looking for him, she was the one who bumped into him most often, after he disappeared.\\" And a child's irrational fears: \\"Born into a time of pain and sadness, Margar developed her own belief about Joe, secret as a crime, and as chilling: that the thought of her impending arrival was so repugnant to him, he could not remain one Moment longer. Something about her that mortified him had emanated from Kay's belly like a poisonous gas or a smelly, jaundiced aura.\\" There is not enough room to quote all the passages I marked and found myself going back to read over again.<br /><br />\\"Origin of Haloes\\" touched me deeply.

He received a shocking telegram at his law office in Philadelphia informing him of his sister's death by suicide and summoning him to New York. The year is 1926 and David, a handsome, well dressed, well educated professional, reflects the breeding and refinement Harlem's elite society demands of members of its inner circle.<br /><br />McKay discovers that his deceased sister Lilian, a writer and intellectual, had married a man she barely knew and, oddly, never confided her change in civil status to him, her own brother. The husband, James Sweet, also an attorney, now has claim to the family estate. After questioning the family's longtime housekeeper, Annie Williams, as well as Mr. Sweet, and many of Lilian's friends, David is not able to accept that his little sister killed herself. He knew her too well, and does not believe that such an extreme act of self destruction was in her nature - no matter what the evidence revealed. He is sure foul play is involved.<br /><br />As he investigates the events leading up to Lilian's death, including the sudden return of her glamorous twin sister Gem from Paris, McKay discovers a dark world of secrets, lies and betrayal by those he trusted most. He cannot throw stones, however, as he himself is carrying the burden of a secret life, the consequence of a terrible tragedy which occurred four years before.<br /><br />Although this page-turner has flaws, I must admit that I was riveted by the storyline and the mysterious figure of Lilian McKay Sweet. Persia Walker's meticulous research, her attention to historic detail, the fascinating period and setting she documents, 1920's Harlem, are compelling reasons to read \\"Harlem Redux,\\" in and of themselves. I live in New York City, and learned an amazing amount about uptown in my hometown from the book. Ms. Walker incorporates anecdotes from places and celebrities like, Langston Hughes, W.E.B. Dubois, The Cotton Club, etc., and also adds commentary on important social issues of the day which enrich the plot considerably.<br /><br />On the downside, I found the narrative to be extremely awkward at times, and very melodramatic.

Beatrice \\"Bede\\" Dunn became fascinated with wild orchids when she got a summer job with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. They sent her to the Bruce Peninsula to map orchids. She spent three months there, wandering around the woodlands, doing some serious hiking and camping-out. When she returned in the fall with fifty rolls of film, she had a new avocation - wild orchid hunting. Bede became passionate about \\"documenting the existence of a single flower or the breeding ground of a particular species.\\" In 1984 she and her boyfriend, Scott, went on a hiking holiday in the Dordogne region of southwestern France. When it began to rain, the couple had an argument about whether to leave their camp and seek shelter elsewhere or to stay put. Bede was adamant about remaining and so she did - alone. When Scott returned two days later the tent and their things were still at the campsite, but Bede was gone, along with her camera, backpack, Michelin guide and a book on wildflowers and orchids. No one ever saw the young woman again. After a massive search and investigation, which garnered much publicity, no evidence of foul play was discovered, no body, no crime scene.<br /><br />Mara Dunn, Bede's identical twin, has never resigned herself to the loss of her sister. She moved to the Dordogne after her divorce became final and went into the interior design business, all the while maintaining contact with the police. Nothing concrete, however, was found concerning the disappearance. During an antique hunting expedition in a near-by town, Mara discovered an old Canon camera in a pile of junk. She noticed it immediately, even though the case was mildewed and worn, because it was identical to the cameras her parents had given her and her sister for their high school graduation. She was sure it was the camera her sister had traveled to France with. Inside the case the initials \\"B. D.\\" were written, and inside the camera was an undeveloped roll of film. Damaged by time and dampness, but still viable, thirty-four photographs were revealed upon development, of wild orchids and a dovecote, taken in what appears to be the local landscape. Mara is convinced the photographs document her sibling's final days.<br /><br />Now, almost twenty years after Bede vanished, Mara, with the photographs in hand, makes yet another effort to find her sister, or her remains. Julian Wood is an English expatriate living in Dordogne and an expert on wild orchids. He is also the author of \\"Wildflowers of the Dordogne/ Fleurs sauvages de la Dordogne,\\" and the man Mara wants to assist her. She asks him to help her retrace her sister's footsteps using the photographs as a guide. Julian is skeptical about turning up anything new on the missing woman. He doesn't really want to get involved and he doesn't care much for pushy, intense women. Besides, the police have copies of the photographs and don't seem very excited by them. When Julian views the final picture though, he becomes agitated and as motivated to begin a search as Mara, but for different reasons. The photo is of a Cypripedium - Sabot de Venus in French, sometimes called Lady's Slipper in English. And since this rare wild orchid does not grow in the Dordogne, or anywhere in Europe, he has his own mystery to unravel - if he decides to become involved with Mara and her investigation.<br /><br />Not only is \\"Deadly Slipper\\" a good literary mystery, it is really a fun book to read. Filled with an exotic cast of characters - from the local bogeyman and his mother, who is even scarier than her son, to the bizarre Sauvignac family, (the local nobility), to Julian Wood's fanatic orchid hunting nemesis and competitor, and the regulars down at Chez Nous, the town's cafe/bar/gourmet restaurant, plus a French police inspector and his lads, these personages all enrich the narrative. The horticulture tidbits are fascinating, and I'm no gardener. The description of food, wine, the gorgeous countryside - c'est tres magnifique! The setting IS France! There is even some romancing going on in between gruesome discoveries. You cannot go wrong, especially if you're looking for something different in sleuthing.<br /><br />JANAagnifique!

Not to read him is a serious invisible disease." P. Neruda	It has taken me years to sit down and finally make a serious commitment to read Julio Cortazar's \\"Hopscotch/La Rayuela.\\" I cannot think of a better companion to devote a few weeks to, maybe even a bit longer - hey, whatever it takes! It depends on your reading speed and the time you take to savor the poetry of the author's language. So, be willing to make a small personal investment in this very special novel, and the reward you reap will be a worthy one. Julio Cortazar will take you to places you have never been before in literature, and may never experience again. I read \\"Hopscotch\\" over this past summer, after a thirty year delay. I can be real stubborn about putting off what is good for me!! Cortazar's imagination is boundless, his prose rich and luminous, his wit and sophistication rare, the dialogue brilliant, the plot...I won't attempt to describe that with a few adjectives. Wander through the extraordinary labyrinthine plot on you own - the way is yours to discover. I promise, you won't get lost!<br /><br />My introduction to \\"La Rayuela\\", (which means hopscotch, like the children's game), is a personal story. I will make it quick. About 30 years ago, while living in Latin America, a friend told me that I reminded him of a character in a novel. The character, La Maga - the book \\"La Rayuela/Hopscotch.\\" With personal interests at stake and much curiosity, I bought a copy in Spanish, which I read with some fluency at the time. After experimenting with which way to approach the novel, and trying both ways, I gave up...and just read the parts about La Maga. I was too impatient at that point in my life, and needed to become a mellower person, to read slower, with more of a sense of play and participation. And Cortazar wants his readers to participate - to make reading his book an interactive experience, not a passive one. I was and still feel touched when I remember my friend's comments regarding La Maga. She is a magnificent character and Cortazer's prose, his language, (Spanish), is exquisite. So, I thought I'd give it another try, in English, perhaps with better results. None! I just wasn't ready, I guess. That happens to me with fiction sometimes. I have to be open to the experience. However, after all these years, I still thought of Horacio Oliveira and La Maga from time to time. And why not? They are truly unforgettable. As I wrote above, I did make time, at last. For an adventure of a lifetime, I recommend you do the same.<br /><br />When Julio Cortazar published \\"La Rayuela\\" in 1966, he turned the conventional novel upside-down and the literary world on its ear with this experiment in writing fiction. He soon became an important influence on writers everywhere. \\"Hopscotch\\" is considered to be one of the best novels written in Spanish. This is an interactive novel where readers are invited to rearrange its sections and read them in different sequences. Read in a linear fashion, \\"Hopscotch\\" contains 700 pages, 155 chapters in three sections: \\"From the Other Side,\\" and \\"From This Side\\" - the first two sections are sustained by relatively chronological narratives and so contrast greatly with the third section, \\"From Diverse Sides,\\" (subtitled \\"Expendable Chapters\\"), which includes philosophical extrapolation, character study, allusions and quotations, and an entirely different version of the \\"ending.\\"<br /><br />The book has no table of contents, but rather a \\"Table of Instructions.\\" There, we learn that two approved readings are possible: from Chapter 1 through 56 \\"in a normal fashion\\", or from Chapter 73 to Chapter 1 to... well, wherever the chapters lead you. The instructions are all in your book and are extremely clear. At the end of each chapter there is a numeric indicator to lead the reader to the next chapter. One never knows where one will be lead. Due to its meandering nature, \\"Hopscotch\\" has been called a \\"Proto-hypertext\\" novel. Cort&aacute;zar probably had this work in mind when he stated, \\"If I had the technical means to print my own books, I think I would keep on producing collage-books.\\"<br /><br />What is most important, as a reviewer, is to give you, the prospective reader, an idea of the narrative and the characters...and to tell you why reading this novel was such an extraordinary experience for me. Horacio Oliveira, our protagonist and sometimes narrator, is an Argentinean expatriate, an intellectual and professed writer in 1950's bohemian Paris. He and his close friends, members of \\"the Club,\\" do lots of partying, drinking, and intellectualizing, discussing art, literature, music and solving the world's problems. Oliveira lives with and loves La Maga, an exotic young woman, somewhat whimsical, at times almost ephemeral who leaves behind her, like the scent of a light perfume, a feeling of poignancy and inevitable loss. La Maga refuses to plan her encounters with Oliveira in advance, preferring instead to run into each other by chance. Then she and Oliveira celebrate the series of circumstances that reunite them - although he knows well the places she frequents and is capable of causing at least a few planned surprises. Eventually, he loses La Maga, who loses her child. With her absence, Oliveira realizes how empty and meaningless his life is and he returns to his native Buenos Aires. There he finds work first as a salesman, then a keeper of a circus cat, and an attendant in an insane asylum.<br /><br />As Oliveira wends his way through France, Uruguay and Argentina looking for his lost love, \\"Hopscotch's\\" narrative takes on an emotionally intense stream of consciousness style, rich in metaphor. Back In Argentina, Oliveira shares his life with his bizarre double, Traveler, and Traveler's wife, Talita, whom Oliveira attempts to remake into a facsimile of La Maga. The game of hopscotch is only developed as a conceit late in the narrative. It is first used to describe Oliveira's confused love for La Maga as \\"that crazy hopscotch.\\"  The theme develops as a metaphor for reaching Heaven from Earth. \\"When practically no one has learned how to make the pebble climb into Heaven, childhood is over all of a sudden and you're into novels, into the anguish of the senseless divine trajectory, into the speculation about another Heaven that you have to learn to reach too.\\" The variations on the children's game are described as \\"spiral hopscotch, rectangular hopscotch, fantasy hopscotch, not played very often.\\" The allusions continue and include some beautiful passages.<br /><br />\\"Hopscotch\\" is much more than a novel. Ultimately, it is best left for each reader to define what it is for himself/herself. Pablo Neruda in a famous quote said, \\"People who do not read Cortazar are doomed. Not to read him is a serious invisible disease.\\" I don't know whether I would go so far. Remember, I put off the experience for many years. But this is one novel that should be read during one's lifetime.

The protagonist, his unique circumstances, and the period in which the novel is set, are most singular and make this a truly special read. It is 1919 England and the Great War is over. Soldiers have returned to their homes and families. Many are maimed in mind and body. And then there are those who do not return at all.<br /><br />World War I was devastating for the British people, militarily and psychologically. \\"In July 1917, at the Battle of Ypres, (better known as the Battle of Passchendaele - Belgium), 70,000 British soldiers died and another 170,000 were wounded.\\" Combined with the disastrous Battle of the Somme, fought in France just a year before, with its 420,000 British casualties (60,000 on the very first day of fighting), the Somme marked \\"the end of an age of vital optimism in British life that has never been recovered,\\" wrote historian John Keegan in \\"The First World War.\\" Approximately 720,000 British soldiers, (from the UK alone), were killed in WWI. Then the terrible influenza epidemic of 1918 devastated the country, and all of Europe, killing millions. Although nothing would bring back the relative innocence of life before 1914, people are slowly rebuilding their lives and a society that had been so hideously interrupted as the story opens.<br /><br />In Scotland Yard, Inspector Ian Rutledge, who was an army officer in France and a survivor of the Somme, has resumed his once promising career, against his doctors' advice. After falling under direct shelling and being buried alive in a frontline trench, he suffered an emotional breakdown - they called it shell shock. Rutledge has not recovered. The doctors told him that hearing voices is not uncommon for a soldier who had undergone such a traumatic incident. It is a way for his mind to accept something of its own creation, in order to conceal what it cannot face otherwise. The particular voice that the Inspector hears is that of Corporal Hamish Macleod, a young Scot who served under him. Macleod had refused to continue fighting and Rutledge was forced to order his execution. Ian knows that if he does not succeed in recovering the skills he had before the war, he may well wind up in a sanitarium for the rest of his life. He is determined to put one foot in front of the other and fight his debilitating illness before it destroys him. Superintendent Bowles, Rutledge's unscrupulous superior, is jealous of his subordinate's pre-war success and has learned of his mental instability. He is determined to see the man fail.<br /><br />Rudtlege has just returned from Warwickshire, where he solved a gruesome and politically charged murder, (\\"A Test of Wills\\"), his first post-war success. He finds that an unknown slasher, who had brutally attacked several women in London's White Chapel area before his trip to Warwickshire, was still on the loose and that the newspapers were resurrecting old Jack the Ripper stories to terrify an already frightened public. When his nemesis, Bowles, asks to see him, Ian expects to be assigned to the slasher case. On the contrary, with all the new publicity, Bowles wants the limelight for himself, and so assigns Rutledge to a seemingly unimportant case in Cornwall. The inspector, exhausted, looks forward to being by the sea.<br /><br />So he travels south on what is thought to be a fool's errand, to Borcombe on the Cornish coast. A brother and sister from the area's most prominent family had committed double suicide there, in the beautiful country house overlooking the ocean where they had lived together all their relatively short lives. Both were in their 30's at the time of death. Olivia Marlowe had been crippled with poliomyelitis as a child, and although her half brother, Nicholas Cheney, fashioned a brace for her to enable her to get around, sometimes she had a great deal of pain.Another half brother, Stephen FitzHugh died just a few days after the suicides, in the same house, from an accidental fall. Lady Ashford, a politically connected cousin to all three diseased persons, felt there had been a \\"hasty judgement, and that insufficient consideration had been given to the likelihood of murder\\" - three suspicious deaths over a period of a few days. She asked Scotland Yard to reopen the case.<br /><br />From the first,  the local constable tells Rutledge that there is absolutely no evidence to support foul play in any of the deaths. Olivia, a reclusive spinster, had been in pain, and although Nicholas was only in his early thirties, he had been gassed at Ypres and suffered terribly at times because of his damaged lungs. Stephen, the third dead family member, had been retrieving some paperwork from the upstairs study and in his rush to leave, he fell down the steps, breaking his neck. He had lost a foot in the war and his balance was off because of it. It is during this discussion that Rutledge learns Olivia Marlowe is, in fact, O. A. Manning, a famous poet whose war poetry had touched him deeply. Her verse had meant so much to him in his darkest hours. Her true identity as the writer had just came to light with her demise. Only Nicholas knew the truth. Rutledge is seriously disturbed by this information, wondering how the woman who wrote such magnificent poems could have killed herself.<br /><br />Guided by the voice of Hamish, the man he unwillingly had executed on the battlefield, (which is, of course, Rutledge's own unconscious mind), Ian begins to uncover the haunting truths of murder and madness within a family. He realizes how his findings had so effected the entire family for so long, and now will forever change the future of the surviving kin. Here are people who struggled for years against an evil they could not defeat, until one man finally brings them all closure. What haunts Rutledge, and left me so moved, is that he arrived so late to the scene.<br /><br />Todd's descriptions of post war England, the main characters, the villagers, even the scenery are extraordinary. I also want to mention that bits and pieces of poetry are included in the novel, supposedly Olivia Marlowe's/ O. A. Manning's work. It seems to have been written by Charles Todd. I think it is very good verse - worth taking note of anyway.<br /><br />Don't be daunted by the number of half brothers, sisters and family history involved in this superbly wrought mystery. There was one mother who married three times. Author Todd does a good job of explaining it all. Oddly, Mr. Todd, who writes like a native of the UK, is an American. I definitely plan to read the third book in the series. Ian Rutledge has become very real to me, as has Hamish. I am rooting for the two to merge and am certainly interested in their further activities. I gave the debut novel 4+ stars. This one is an easy 5. Highly recommended!<br /><br />JANAdeal of pain.

I am arriving to relieve your tedium. And bringing along a very big surprise. Love and kisses.\\"<br /><br />Fallon is an artist, a painter, who is sexually repressed. Her dearly departed was as cold in life as he is in death. Poor man! Anna's surprise is Montague Bridgeman, \\"handsome,\\" \\"brooding,\\" \\"haunted,\\" \\"worldly-wise,\\" \\"jaded\\"....these are Ms. Lawless' adjectives, not mine. Anyway, back to the Gilchrist country home where we discover that Anna bid on Montague at the Boston Women's Auxiliary fund raising auction and won. Why does it seem strange that the 19th century Boston Women's Auxiliary would be auctioning off a potential love slave - publicly?? She is donating him to Fallon for one week for anything and everything. Fallon decides to paint him, on canvas. I don't think they had edible paint in those days. He decides to awaken her. Both succeed. If it matters, I am not clear on the period in which the novella is set. I would place it at the turn of the 20th century.<br /><br />As erotica, \\"Taboo: A Novel of Forbidden Sensual Delights\\" may contain delights, but as far as taboo goes, I am a 21st century lady...or woman. There's minimal storyline and the erotica is typical - or same old, same old. If and when I pick up an erotic novel or short stories, I want something special. Otherwise, I'd rather read a spicy romance, and there are plenty on the market. As authors of erotica, I prefer Emma Holly (Black Lace Series), Susannah Indigo (\\"Oysters Among Us\\"), Susie Bright, Laura Reese, Robin Schone, Beatrice Small, or check-out [...] for excellent women's erotica selections.

Long before author Janet Evanovich turned Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter extraordinaire, loose on the citizens of Trenton, NJ, she wrote 12 short romance novels, all screwball comedies with happy endings, some involving just a tad of mystery for extra spice. These novellas were published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. I have read and enjoyed many of them. It is also interesting, if you are an Evanovich fan, to read one of her early books and compare it, her characters and her now famous humor with her more recent work. Unfortunately, \\"Back to the Bedroom,\\" which has just been reissued, is one of the weakest books in the series. It is a short, simple romance with minimal plot.<br /><br />Katherine Finn, \\"called Kate to her face and the 'Formidable Finn' behind her back,\\" is a professional cellist and former child prodigy, who has a Type A Plus personality. Divorced and paying off the mortgage on a Washington, DC, Federal style brownstone, she has her day scheduled from early morning to late at night, practicing, playing, giving music lessons, etc.. Her next door neighbor, handsome bachelor David Peter Dodd, recently won millions in the lottery and is taking an extremely long vacation. He has plans to be temporarily employed for a long time. David has never met Kate because she is always on the run. Then one awful morning a helicopter drops a heavy piece of metal, accidentally, through her roof and David comes to the rescue.<br /><br />Of course she is beautiful, he is handsome and there is mucho chemistry between them. Typically there are all kinds of high jinks, the romantic ones, the ones involving sweet, pistol-packing old lady, Elsie Hawkins, who rents a room from Kate, and also those including her drug producing/dealing neighbors. Some of Ms. Evanovich's attempts at humor do fall flat. She tries too hard, especially in the episodes with the drug dealing criminals. Interestingly, for Stephanie Plum fans, this was the first of four romances to feature Elsie Hawkins, the prototype for Grandma Mazur.<br /><br />As I wrote previously, \\"Back to the Bedroom\\" is short, simple and sweet.

This is a stand-alone novel, and one can easily get to know the cast of characters and their history without having read prior books. Ms. Kellerman provides a terrific change of pace from my usual fiction fare. Although these mysteries have their share of violence, gruesomeness and unsavory individuals, the ethnic/cultural aspect of the stories and the sheer humanity of the characters are refreshing.<br /><br />LAPD Detective Sergeant Peter Decker met Rina Lazarus, a young and very beautiful widow, while investigating a rape at a yeshiva in Deep Canyon, CA, where she lives and works. Rina is an Orthodox Jewess and the mother of two small sons, Samuel and Jacob. Attracted to each other from their first meeting, Rina and Peter, feel their relationship is \\"bashert,\\" meant to be or predestined. Raised a Baptist, Peter is studying with Rabbi Aaron Schulman to become an observant Jew, both for his own spiritual needs and in order to marry Rina. At times, however, he has doubts about the course he has chosen, although he never doubts his feelings for Rina. The couple are very much in love. Besides her beauty, outside and in, Decker is drawn to her total lack of guile.<br /><br />Decker has become very close to Rina's sons and takes them on a camping trip where one of the boys discovers the charred remains of two corpses. Peter, who works in juvenile crime, is temporarily assigned to homicide to investigate this case.

The fact that he is the father of a teen-age daughter, from a prior marriage, only increases his despair and anger.

Long before author Janet Evanovich turned Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter extraordinaire, loose on the citizens of Trenton, NJ, she wrote 12 short romance novels, all screwball comedies with happy endings, some involving just a tad of mystery for extra spice. These small treats, (like a piece of good chocolate, they lift your spirits), were published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. I have read and enjoyed almost all of them. It is also interesting, if you are an Evanovich fan, to read one of her early novelettes and compare it, her characters and her now famous humor, with her latest work. \\"The Grand Finale\\"  is one of the weakest books in the series. It is a short, simple romance with minimal plot.<br /><br />Lingonberry Knudsen, called Berry, is a young divorcee and pizza parlor owner with an extraordinarily kind heart. She recently advertised for a delivery boy but hired three homeless old woman instead. Two of them cannot drive, poor eyesight, and one has no sense of direction, so they're back at the pizzeria baking, while Berry is in an isolated part of town making deliveries after dark in her battered surplus army jeep. The three older ladies also moved in with Berry, who lives in a small space over the store. One can hardly expect Lingonberry to send them back to their old spot on the floor at the train station. As she approaches what seems to be a deserted house, she hears a kitten crying...or mewing. The tiny kitty cat is stuck up a tree. So up Berry climbs to the rescue, just in time to see the home owner, and prospective pizza owner, drive up in a perfectly restored Stutz Bearcat, enter the house, climb the stairs to his bedroom and proceed to undress - no shades - almost exactly at Berry's eye level. She lets go of the branch she has been sitting on, while ogling, just as Mr. Gorgeous drops his briefs. Needless to say, she falls out of the tree, on top of the pizza, and screams. Thus she meets tall, dark and handsome Jake Sawyer.<br /><br />Jake teaches first grade school at the local elementary school. As a chemist, he originally worked as a corporate chemist in R&D. He hated his job and hated standing/sitting under florescent lights everyday. Therefore Jake Sawyer set his mind to work on something more interesting - Gunk! He invented Gunk, which all kids and some adults love. \\"It creeps. It crawls. It comes in five scents and three flavors (yes, it's edible). It's freezable. It's disgusting!\\" Don't tell that to the kids.`<br /><br />So we have adorable Berry with a talent for disaster; Jake the answer to almost every disaster I can think of; Mrs. Dugan, Mrs. Fitz and Mildred, three outrageously eccentric old women, a new dog and a lot of home made butterscotch pudding.<br /><br />As I wrote previously, this is short, simple and sweet. If fluff offends you, steer clear of \\"The Grand Finale,\\" written in the days when Janet Evanovich was developing the talent that authored the terrific Stephanie Plum series. There are other books in this Loveswept series which are much more interesting, although not really more complex than this one.<br /><br />JANA<br />  <br />Jake teaches first grade school at the local elementary school.

I may be Karen Marie Moning's biggest fan! I have read every one of her books and Daegus MacKelter, the dark, intense, super-alpha hero from the \\"Dark Highlander,\\" and his time traveling brother Drustan, (\\"Kiss of the Highlander\\"), are two of my favorite fictional men. Although I remain loyal to Daegus, the MacKelter brothers may have some competition now with the introduction of their 9th century kinsman, Laird Cian MacKeltar, in Ms. Moning's latest novel, \\"Spell of the Highlander.\\" A major bonus in this new book is that all three McKelters, along with their mates, appear here.<br /><br />Cian is a Celtic warrior and the most powerful Keltar Druid ever to live. He is heir to the arcane magic of the Old Ones, but has been imprisoned for eleven centuries in The Dark Glass, one of the four coveted Unseelie Hallows, objects of seemingly boundless powers. The Dark Glass has been stolen, along with other priceless antiquities, due to the intervention of Aoibheal, Queen of the Fae, (the Tuatha De Danaan), who is determined to destroy the dark Druid sect of the Draghar.<br /><br />Lucan Myrddin Trevayne, a former pupil of Cian's back eleven hundred years ago, is the evil sorcerer and ancient enemy who imprisoned him and who will stop at nothing to reclaim the Dark Glass and gain more power.<br /><br />Jessica St.James, a graduate student in archeology at the University of Chicago, receives a midnight phone call from her doctoral advisor. Apparently he has been involved in a fender bender and needs her to go to his office on campus to accept an important emergency delivery. What kind of package, she wonders, gets delivered in the early morning hours? A mysterious one. The package is huge, the size of a sarcophagus. It turns out to be a mirror with an ornate golden frame carved with symbols and glyph-like shapes, apparently an ancient relic. Her first thought is that she would love to authenticate its age and origins. But sleep and a hard days work beckons, especially since she will have to take the professor's classes the following day. When she returns to the office the next evening to grade students' papers, she finds a strange man there who attempts to kill her. Cian MacKelter calls to Jessi from inside the mirror and gives her the Celtic words which will temporarily free him from his prison to defend her. Her terror overcomes her disbelief and she recites the spell. Cian keeps his word and does save her. Did you doubt?<br /><br />Cian's freedom is transitory and he has a lot of work to do before he can break the spell which has ensorcelled him and free himself permanently. He desperately needs Jessica to help him. Actually, he needs her to believe that he really exists and that she is not crazy first. On Samhain, in twenty-two days, Cian's hated enemy Lucan Trevayne must pay a tithe to the mirror to keep MacKelter imprisoned. All \\"Tuatha De bindings, both the Seelie (the good fae) compacts, and the Unseelie (bad fae) indentures, must be periodically reaffirmed by gold. Usually compacts only require reaffirmation if something is changed or violated within the agreement. However, since the Dark Arts run counter to the nature of things, the Dark Glass must be paid every one hundred years, on the anniversary of the original date of binding at midnight.\\" Cian has to keep himself and the mirror hidden during the twenty-two day period and plan his revenge. He cannot allow Trevayne to continue to live. Lucan looks to obtain the Dark Book, the contents of which are so potent that \\"continual exposure to it will change a man forever...and not for the better.\\" Lucan Trevayne is bad enough to begin with - the world does not need him to get worse! He must be stopped at all cost.<br /><br />Obviously, Cian is the typical mouthwatering male hunk Ms. Moning usually creates. And Jessica is bold, beautiful, intelligent, etc., in other words, a perfect MacKelter mate. Their courtship is similar to previous MacKelter romancing rituals. I really enjoyed the \\"Spell of the Highlander,\\" however, here's where I might run into some trouble with other fans. My critique is totally constructive and I do write as a loyal Karen Marie Moning reader. Her storylines are usually much more complex - intricate plots, subplots, etc. Not so here. The narrative is interesting, but very simple, without any real twists and turns. Cian is a likeable character, but not at all complicated. In fact, at times he is almost caveman-like. And Jessi is so stereotypical. Heroines like Jessica exist in hundreds of romance novels. I have read many books by this author and know what she is capable of. Maybe it's me, but I wonder if pressure from her publisher is forcing her to pump out the books. I really hope not, because I so look forward to reading Ms. Moning's work. Also, BASTA!! Enough with women drooling all over men and visa versa. It is getting old and there are more subtle ways, and sexier ones, to express lust and sensuality.<br /><br />From what Ms. Moning writes in a brief afterward, she is planning more novels about the MacKelters and the Fae. I say \\"terrific!!\\" I only hope the author grows as a writer as she further develops her wonderful characters. Highly recommended!<br />JANAhowever, here's where I might run into some trouble with other fans. My critique is totally constructive and I do write as a loyal Karen Marie Moning reader.

Kathryn Harrison's latest novel, \\"Envy,\\" opens with protagonist Will Moreland, a New York City psychoanalytic psychotherapist, about to attend his 25th college reunion. His wife Carole is adamant about not accompanying him, although he tries to tempt her with descriptions of the luxury hotel where he will be staying, the pool, excellent restaurants, room service, and pay-per-view. The fact is, Carole cannot cope with the inevitable questions that will be asked by strangers. Until three years ago the Morelands were a family of four. There were two children then, Samantha and Luke. Ten year-old Luke died in a tragic boating accident and both parents are still dealing with their grief. Then there will be the comments and curiosity about Will's identical twin, another Cornell alumni, the famous Mitchell Moreland. Mitch, a world renown long-distance swimmer, is as well known a sports figure as Lance Armstrong or Tiger Woods. Unfortunately the athlete has been estranged from his family since Will's wedding. He left the reception shortly after delivering the traditional best man's toast to the bride and groom, and has not made contact with his relatives since - over ten years now. Although Will is not thrilled about discussing these private aspects of his life, his inquisitiveness about his fellow alumni of the class of '79 overcomes his reluctance to attend. He also wants to obtain some information from an old lover about something he had read in the recent alumni bios - something which is causing him great anxiety.<br /><br />At the party Will strikes up a slightly flirtatious conversation with Elizabeth, the ex-girlfriend whom he has not seen in twenty-five years. He discovered that she has a daughter, now in her mid-twenties, and after doing the math realizes the baby was born a few months after the two broke up. Although Elizabeth married late in her pregnancy, Moreland cannot help but wonder if he is the father. Their encounter turns hostile when he requests a DNA sample - a strand of the daughter's hair to determine paternity. He leaves the festivities a day early and when he returns home does not mention the incident his wife.<br /><br />Carol Moreland, a calm, serene woman, had always been open to discussing anything with Will. Her husband thinks of her as a woman who \\"seems at peace with life, with herself. Not like me.\\" Since the death of their son, however, she has distanced from her husband both physically and emotionally. She used to be a passionate sexual partner, up for anything - not any more. Oddly, though Carole practices yoga and meditation, she is addicted to violent true crime books - so graphic that she hides them from her young daughter. She really does not want to discuss their problems, although Will, as a shrink who is his own favorite patient, longs to talk about and analyze their lack of communication, among other subjects. Actually, Will is something of a motor mouth, always ready to go on at length about his feelings, problems, dreams, the unconscious, etc.. He is really too analytical and over-intellectualizes his own difficulties. Moreland winds up going back into therapy with his training analyst, Daniel, a psychiatrist's psychiatrist who has worked with him before.<br /><br />Moreland also talks frankly with his aging father, a retired veterinarian, who at seventy has become an artistic photographer - even exhibiting his work in a SoHo gallery. He is having an affair with a younger woman, with his wife's consent.<br /><br />The primary reason Will goes back into analysis, is because he has begun to have violent and vivid sexual fantasies about every women he sees, including his patients, which makes it extremely difficult for him to function effectively in his therapeutic role. He is depressed. He also obsesses about his past relationship with his twin, who was born with a port-wine stain that colored more than half his face purple. The boy was teased mercilessly by other children. As a result, he became shy and self-conscious at an early age. He actually took up long distance swimming because it is a loner's sport. Will has always felt guilty at having been born \\"unmarked.\\"  The man is stressed out to the extent that he has considered taking a leave of absence from his practice. I find Will to be a very sympathetic character and the source of much of the novel's humor, as well as its sadness. His conversations with his analyst and patients are also very interesting and provide tremendous insight into basic psychoanalytic techniques - except for one potential analysand.<br /><br />An outrageous young woman, (highly inappropriate behavior), comes to Will's office for an intake. She is essential to the plot, but her interactions with Will are (hopefully) purely fictionalized. The girl, in her early twenties, is sexually obsessed with older men. In fact, she \\"collects\\" them. She describes her sexual adventures to Will explicitly, blow-by-blow accounts, obviously looking to excite him and add him to her collection. Her \\"Fatal Attraction\\" behavior provides an element of the suspense thriller at times.<br /><br />Kathryn Harrison has done it again. This is a beautifully written, intelligent novel, whose characters, and their inner workings, are more exciting than what goes on in the world around them. Their development and dialogue are brilliant, as are the author's descriptions of the surroundings, the  city and countryside, even the poignant photographs taken by Will's dad. There are also some major surprises which will shock - at least they shocked me - in terms of various betrayals. \\"Envy\\" is certainly an appropriate title for this book.<br /><br />Much of the author's writing contains themes of narcissism, family violation, physical suffering and sexual taboo. \\"Envy\\" is more humorous than her other books that I have read, and more erotic. Although there are painful moments, and the subject of possible incest does come up, pain and suffering are not the main focus. \\"Envy\\"  definitely deserves 5 Stars, as far as I am concerned, and I highly recommend it.

She is extremely intelligent and perceptive, artistically talented, and if overly thin, she is still quite attractive with her waist-long red gold hair and chiseled features. She has a wonderful husband, Carl, who loves her very much, despite her sometimes bizarre behavior. And she co-owns a successful videotaping business, recording and editing the life celebrations of others - turning them into perfect events in her workshop.<br /><br />In reality, Ann Rogers is seriously ill, both physically and mentally. As a girl she was diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus. She never followed doctors' instructions properly, behaving irresponsibly about eating regularly, testing blood sugar and injecting insulin. It was if she had a death wish. She certainly learned early on the consequences of her behavior. Her guardians, her father and maternal aunt, didn't monitor her as they should have. They were deemed negligent by Ann's doctor, causing an investigation by Child Protection Services when the adolescent girl was rushed to the hospital with severe insulin shock. It was not the first time such an emergency occurred. As an adult, Ann, if anything, has become even less responsible about caring for herself. Along with her potentially lethal carelessness, she exacerbates her poor health with an addiction to crystal meth - speed. She has been warned about the dangers of diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes which occurs when small blood vessels in the retina become swollen, or tiny new blood vessels start to grow and block the retina causing the complete loss of sight. Taking drugs, especially speed, is part of a continuing pattern demonstrating Ann's lack of concern for her life. She also steals compulsively from New York City's most expensive department stores. Usually, there is no need or desire to possess the stolen items, so they are often disposed of quickly.<br /><br />Ann's great grandfather was a photographer who lived and worked in Mexico for many years. The most lucrative aspect of his business was photographing the dead, especially children. Back in the late 1800's young children died frequently. They were often carried off by childhood illnesses, and there was a severe meningitis epidemic in his area in 1886. People, even the poorest, wanted memorial photographs of their \\"angelitos,\\" (little angels). When Ann's father, the famous photographic artist, Edgar Evens Rogers, discovered a portfolio of his forefather's work he was fascinated. He began to photograph young Ann in the nude, in poses of death. She became his primary, in fact, his only subject.<br /><br />Virginia Crane Rogers died giving birth to Ann. Mariette Crane, Virginia's sister, came to care for the infant and never left, becoming like a mother to the girl. The only interest her father showed in his daughter was as a model - her development as a human being ignored. And when her teen body began to fill out, although still quite thin and immature, he lost interest in her altogether. Edgar Rogers committed suicide in 1979, and photographed his own death from a camera set on a tripod with a timer attached. Needless to say, the resulting pictures scarred Ann terribly, not that these were her first scars.<br /><br />New York's Museum of Modern Art has long been planning a retrospective of Edgar Rogers' work. As the exhibit's inauguration date approaches, Ann becomes extremely stressed which causes her to behave more erratically than usual. Many of Rogers' photographs will be on display for the first time. These are the most graphic, where prepubescent Ann is posed as if dead, or in sexually explicit situations. Some of the photos even show self-mutilation as art - art which violated the girl's, and then the woman's life.<br /><br />Katheryn Harrison writes brilliantly, elegantly. Her narrative approaches poetry at times. However, \\"Exposure\\" is much more than a novel of psychological suspense. The storyline is devastatingly painful to read. Ann is most certainly over exposed. She was abused - her life, her very privacy invaded from childhood and made public. She was treated like an object by her only living parent. While reading, I  often felt as if I were rubbernecking at the site of a horrendous automobile accident. I knew I would be sickened by what I saw, but I could not turn away. I became a voyeur. The characters and the read are so compelling, however, it is almost impossible to put the book down.<br /><br />Since the publication of her memoir, \\"The Kiss\\" in 1997, Ms. Harrison and her work have elicited much public attention - of the wrong kind, I think. She wrote about the incestuous affair she had with her father when she was in her 20's. Unfortunately, the autobiographical account probably receives all the scrutiny because of the taboo subject matter, rather than because the prose and the story are of literary merit - which they are. Much of her writing has pathological narcissism, violation, physical suffering and sexual taboo as central themes. Potential readers may find these topics too distasteful to deal with. This is a shame because the author is extremely talented and writes about much that is relevant in today's world. I recommend \\"Exposure,\\" but suggest that for an initial experience one should begin with another Harrison novel. I am reading \\"Envy\\" right now, and find it excellent.<br /><br />JANApsychological suspense. The storyline is devastatingly painful to read. Ann is most certainly over exposed.

She had personal reasons for wanting to help the kids to stay off drugs, and to put the pushers away for a long time. When she was identified by the bad guys as a cop and almost killed, she resigned from the force, burnt out.

She purchases the house, called Haben, from schooner Captain Ivan Rassmussen, a descendant of pirates. His family had lived at Haben for generations. After the sale is completed, she discovers that the toilet is dysfunctional. It leaks so bad that the bathroom floor collapses and falls into the kitchen and downstairs bathroom. The bathroom mirrors go the way of the floor. A new heater is needed desperately before the cold sets in, and the wooden porch floor is rotten. Stephanie, with limited funds, feels she has been swindled by Ivan, And the final straw, his ancient Aunt Tess, long departed from this world, (at least physically), haunts the widow's walk.

The protagonist, his unique circumstances, and the period in which the novel is set, however, are most unique and make this a very special read. It is 1919 England and the Great War is over. Soldiers have returned to their homes and families. Many are maimed in mind and body. And then there are those who do not return at all. Approximately 720,000 British soldiers, (from the UK alone), were killed in WWI. Then the terrible influenza epidemic of 1918 devastated the country, and all of Europe, killing millions. Although nothing will bring back the relative innocence of life before 1914, people are slowly rebuilding their lives and a society that had been so hideously interrupted.<br /><br />In Scotland Yard, Inspector Ian Rutledge, who was an army officer in France, is resuming his once promising career. He is also keeping a terrible secret. After falling under direct shelling and being buried alive in a frontline trench, he suffered an emotional breakdown - they called it shell shock. He has not recovered. The doctors told him that hearing voices is not uncommon for a soldier who had undergone such a traumatic incident. It is a way for his mind to accept something of its own creation, in order to conceal what it cannot face otherwise. The particular voice that the Inspector hears is that of Corporal Hamish Macleod, a young man who had served under him. Macleod had refused to continue fighting and Rutledge ordered his execution. He knows that if he does not succeed in recovering the skills he had before the war, he may well wind up in a sanitarium for the rest of his life. He is determined to put one foot in front of the other and fight his debilitating illness before it destroys him. Superintendent Bowles, Rutledge's unscrupulous superior, is jealous of his subordinate's pre-war success and has learned of his mental instability. He is determined to see the man fail.<br /><br />In the village of Upper Streetham, Warwickshire, Colonel Charles Harris, an ex-Army officer, has been murdered and the Chief suspect is Captain Mark Wilton, a Victoria Cross decorated war hero, friend of the royal family, and fiance to the dead man's ward. When the local police request the aid of Scotland Yard, Bowles assigns the politically charged case to Rutledge.<br /><br />The Inspector actually does begins to function despite his alter ego's harassment and running commentary. He finds more than one person with a motive to murder the Colonel. The complex psychological study and mystery unfold with much suspense and, although the pace slows at times, the character study of Rutledge more than makes up for any weaknesses in the narrative. The Inspector is a really special character and it is impossible not to like and admire him. His empathy with both victims and suspects is extraordinary. Even under extreme stress, it is clear why he was such a strong leader under fire. In a way he represents a generation of emotionally fragile veterans, trying to resume life after a carnage such as the world had never seen before.<br /><br />Author Charles Todd writes of Rutledge: \\"Before the war it had been the case that drove him night and day - partly from a gritty determination that murderers must be found and punished. He had believed deeply in that, with the single-minded idealism of youth and a strong sense of moral duty towards victims who could no longer speak for themselves. But the war had altered his viewpoint, had shown him that the best of men could kill, given the right circumstances, as he himself had done over and over again. Not only the enemy, but  his own men, sending them out to be slaughtered even when he had known beyond doubt that they would die and that the order to advance was madness.\\"<br /><br />Todd's descriptions of post war England, the main characters and the villagers, even the scenery are extraordinary. Oddly, Mr. Todd, who writes like a native of the UK, is an American. I definitely plan to read the second book in the series. Ian Rutledge has become very real to me, as has Hamish. I am rooting for the two to merge and am certainly interested in their further activities. I give this first effort 4+ stars. Highly recommended!<br />JANAlike a native of the UK, is an American.

88808:US	51247650	R2RCF6YZVBJP0T	0380732661	885145717	The Ritual Bath (Decker/Lazarus Novels)	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	An award-winning debut mystery - the 1st in the outstanding Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series	\\"The Ritual Bath,\\" Faye Kellerman's debut novel introducing the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series won the 1987 Mcavity Award for Best First Mystery.<br /><br />Detective Peter Decker is called to investigate a vicious rape in a remote Orthodox Jewish Community in the California hills outside of Los Angeles. One of the women was brutally attacked as she walked home from the mikvah, the bathhouse where the cleansing ritual is performed. Rina Lazarus, the lovely young widow who discovered the victim, acts as an intermediary between Decker and the yeshiva, (a Jewish religious seminary), students and their families who are suspicious of outsiders.<br /><br />Decker is also working on a case involving a brutal serial rapist with a foot fetish, who operates in an area near the yeshiva. It is a possibility that this psychopath, called the Foothill rapist, is the attacker. Or the perpetrator(s) could be a gang of teen thugs who have been responsible for anti-Semitic vandalism and violence in the past. And then there are suspects who are members of the religious community itself. From the first, it is clear that further assaults of a similar nature are more than likely to occur. The next incident, on the yeshiva grounds, is a horrific murder. As evidence accumulates, it appears that Rina is the psychopath's primary target.<br /><br />Rina is a beautiful woman both outside and in. The mother of two young sons, she lost her husband, a brilliant seminary scholar, at a very young age. She is now in her late twenties and maintains the mikvah, as well as teaches mathematics, to support herself and her boys. She has not had much contact with men since her husband's untimely death, and although she and Decker are very much drawn to each other from the first, she refuses to involve herself with a man who is not an Orthodox Jew. Rina had a secular upbringing and chose to become an observant Jewess when she married.<br /><br />The author deftly handles the workings of various intense personal relationships and crime solving with apparent ease. As with the other Kellerman books I read, her characters are her strength. They are truly three-dimensional and their dialogue is extremely realistic. I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery, the humanity of the characters, and details of the Orthodox Jewish customs and lifestyle.<br /><br />Her mysteries are solid. No loose threads are left behind. I plan to read more of this excellent author's work and highly recommend it to others.<br />JANAme solving with apparent ease.

Stephanie Plum, feisty heroine of \\"Two For The Dough,\\" is a novice bounty hunter, recently employed by her sleazy Cousin Vinny, the owner of a bail bonding company. Ms. Plum, who was received with great public acclaim in Janet Evanovich's award-winning debut novel \\"One For The Money,\\" is back and packing Big Time with her .38 Smith and Wesson, stun guns, mace and a humongous attitude. Unfortunately she's got a lousy aim. Steph is divorced, sans money and culturally-challenged, being born and raised in Trenton, New Jersey. I'm originally from NJ, so I am allowed to say that!<br /><br />Her most recent assignment has her on the trail of Kenny Mancuso, an ex-GI who accidentally shot his childhood friend Moogey Bues in the knee with a stolen gun and then jumped bail. Mancuso is suspected of stealing some powerful military weapons which have been used to kill cops and civilians alike. This fellow is a real sicko. He also happens to be a distant relative of Joseph Morelli, the guy Steph ran over with her father's Buick after he cavalierly copped her virginity when she was sixteen and then disappeared from her life for 3 years. He hasn't improved or matured much with age. Joe is a law enforcement officer now, appropriately working in vice. He is continuously horning in on Stephanie's investigations, and obviously still has the hots for her.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Spiro, another Mancuso friend and the assistant undertaker at Stiva's Funeral Home, hires our  fugitive recovery agent to track down twenty-four missing coffins, sans corpses thank goodness. When Grandma Mazur accompanies Stephanie to Stiva's, and a variety of other local funeral parlors, the real trouble, and laughter, begins.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, \\"Two for the Dough\\" is filled with side-splitting humor and features some of the most hilarious characters I have met in ages, with Grandma Mazur, Stephanie's maternal grandmother, a pistol-packin,' roller blading clotheshorse in the best supporting role. Ranger, a 2nd generation Cuban American, ex-Special Forces creative genius of a bounty hunter, is Stephanie's professional advisor, who attempts to minimize her bumbling. And Lula, a 250 pound-plus ex-hooker, aspires to be a bounty hunter & is working on her resume.<br /><br />Of course there's the mystery and sleuth work...which I would rate 4 stars. However Ms. Evanovich's humor, characters and subplots brings the rating up to a definite 5 stars. By all means, take a trip to your local library, bookstore...or Amazon.com, of course, & get this chock-full of great reading gem of a book. Also, beware!! Janet Evanovich has 9 more Stephanie Plum books on the market to date, and you won't want to miss any of them - they're as addictive as a great belly-laugh!<br />JANACuban American, ex-Special Forces creative genius of a bounty hunter, is Stephanie's professional advisor, who attempts to minimize her bumbling.

89724:US	51247650	R3GIWK3BNHZ3R2	0451528328	487132973	The Virginian (Signet Classics)	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	"The Virginian" established the fictional code of the West.	Owen Wister's \\"The Virginian,\\" first published in 1902, is considered by many to exemplify the American Western novel. Wister certainly established the code of the West, and the stereotypical figures of the tough but genteel and courageous cowboy, (the one wearing the white hat and riding the white horse), the spinster schoolmarm from back East, horse rustlers, and the corrupt villain beyond redemption. In fact, the novel contains a scene constituting the first known \\"shootout\\" in American literature. Our narrator is an easterner, a man who visits Judge Henry, the Virginian's employer, at his ranch on Sunk Creek fairly frequently. I came to think of him as Mr. Wister himself, who did travel to Wyoming and parts West extensively.<br /><br />From my perspective, the Virginian, whose true name is never revealed, is anything but a stereotype, although many heroes have been modeled after him. Yes, he is tall, dark and handsome. This description is not terribly distinctive or unusual. One could definitely call him the strong silent type, and he does have a marked sense of honor, loyalty and justice. However, born and raised in Virginia before the Civil War, it is realistic to assume he was instilled with the values of a southern gentleman. Although he was not to the manor born, his family was decent and hardworking, and one certainly does not need wealth to live by the Good Book. A war veteran and a longtime wanderer throughout the western territories, he had learned survival skills by his mid-twenties. Loose lips was not a desirable trait if one wanted to live a long and healthy life. I found the Virginian to be a credible character, flawed like all men, but with a clear and unwavering sense of right and wrong. He is a man suited to his environment and to his times, and personifies the rugged individual.<br /><br />It is important to note the period in which this novel was written to fully enjoy it, just as it is crucial to understand the times and setting in which such authors as Charles Dickens, Jane Austen and George Eliot wrote. In \\"The Virginian,\\" Wister states: \\"It was through the Declaration of Independence that we Americans acknowledged the eternal equality of man. For by it we abolished a cut-and-dried aristocracy. We had seen little men artificially held up in high places, and great men artificially held down in low places, and our own justice-loving hearts abhorred this violence to human nature. Therefore, we decreed that every man should henceforth have equal liberty to find his own level. By this very decree we acknowledged and gave freedom to true aristocracy, saying, 'Let the best man win, whoever he is.' That is America's word. That is true democracy.\\" Believing this so strongly, is it any wonder that the character of the Virginian was created?<br /><br />As for Miss Mary Stark Wood of Bennington, Vermont, who calls herself spinster at age 20, she is a woman ahead of her time. Many have been created in Mary's image, but she is the original. Intelligent, independent, adventurous, full of pluck and, yes, pretty, she sets off to teach school in Bear Creek, Wyoming, to get away from family pressure to wed an unwanted suitor, and probably to see more of the world. An acquaintance and correspondent of Miss Wood's, Mrs. Balaam, a Bear Creek resident, wrote and told the young woman of the teaching position. Mary accepts, and as it happens, the Virginian is the first to meet her upon her arrival. He actually rescues her, as the primitive stagecoach she has been traveling in is mired-down in a creek - the driver drunk and quite irresponsible. She is later embarrassed, remembering how tightly she clung to the cowboy, in fright, not out of flirtatiousness. He, however, cannot get her out of his mind. This is so much more than a romance novel, although there is romance aplenty, of both the classical nature and the kind between a man courting a woman.<br /><br />The Virginian's bete noir is an evil character named Trampas. The two clash throughout the tale until the final showdown. One of the books classic lines has our hero responding to Trampas after a nasty insult, \\"When you call me that, smile.\\" He is also betrayed by a trusted friend who becomes corrupt out of greed and weakness. Law and order had not arrived in Wyoming Territory and it was up to individuals to maintain a civil society. Mary Wood calls this taking the law into one's own hands, or vigilantism. This issue becomes a bone of contention between herself and the Virginian.<br /><br />Owen Wister imbues his characters, especially the Virginian and Mary, with a remarkable sense of depth. Their relationship, as well as his relationship with his old friend Steve, are depicted with particular poignancy. The initial reserve between Mary and her suitor is normal for the period. However, the sexual tension between them is palpable. Graphic love scenes are not necessary here. The author does more with a kiss and an embrace than many modern writers accomplish with all their erotica. There is some terrific humor also. I found Emily, the hen, to be one of the most original animals in fiction and absolutely hilarious. Wister's vivid passages describing the Wyoming wilderness are extraordinary, making it easy for one to visualize the gorgeous landscapes. The pace is somewhat slow at times. However, I did not find the narrative at all tedious. Time passed more slowly back then and things took longer to accomplish for obvious reasons. This difference is demonstrated in the way the tale is told.<br /><br />\\"The Virginian\\" was voted by the Western American Writers in 1977 as the greatest western novel of all time. Whether it is or isn't is debatable, but I really enjoyed it. In this 100th anniversary edition Max Evans contributes a new and fascinating Afterwards.

Long before author Janet Evanovich loosed Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter extraordinaire, on the citizens of Trenton, NJ, she wrote 12 short romance novels, all screwball comedies with happy endings, some involving just a tad of mystery/suspense. These small treats, (like a piece of good chocolate, they lift your spirits), were published, originally by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. I have read and enjoyed them all - but then I love almost everything Ms. Evanovich writes. \\"Love Overboard,\\" was released by Harper Torch, (Harper Collins), in January 2005 for those who missed the book first time around when it was titled, \\"Ivan Takes A Wife.\\" Very few changes have been made to the original material other than some necessary editing.<br /><br />Oddly enough, \\"Lover Overboard's\\" heroine is named Stephanie too, Stephanie Lowe, and could very well be the ancestor of Ms. Plum. Like Stephanie Plum, Stephanie Lowe is bright, witty, sexy, and in law enforcement....a former a cop. When she graduated from the Academy she looked all of sixteen, perfect to work undercover as a narc at a high school. She had personal reasons for wanting to help the kids to stay off drugs, and to  put the pushers away for a long time. When she was identified by the bad guys as a cop and almost killed, she resigned from the force, burnt out. She wanted a change of pace, scenery and local culture, so she moved a good distance away from New Jersey.<br /><br />Her dream home is in Camden, Maine, overlooking the ocean. Stephanie plans to turn it into a B&B for the tourists who flock to the area each year for the Windjammer cruises, as well as to spend time on the gorgeous Maine coast and offshore islands. She purchases the house, called Haben, from schooner Captain Ivan Rassmussen, a descendant of pirates. His family had lived at Haben for generations. After the sale is completed, she discovers that the toilet is dysfunctional. It leaks so bad that the bathroom floor collapses and falls into the kitchen and downstairs bathroom. The bathroom mirrors go the way of the floor. A new heater is needed desperately before the cold sets in, and the wooden porch floor is rotten. Stephanie, with limited funds, feels she has been swindled by Ivan, And the final straw, his ancient Aunt Tess, long departed from this world, (at least physically), haunts the widow's walk. Fortunately for Ivan, the ghost will only speak to women.<br /><br />Stephanie's cousin Lucy, the chef on the \\"Josiah T. Savage,\\" the Captain's schooner,  is engaged to a plumber. The couple plan to take a week off to wed and enjoy a short honeymoon. Lucy promises Stephanie that if she will take her place as cook on Ivan's 100 year-old ship for this one week, and feed the handsome Captain, a confirmed bachelor, the crew and passengers, she will have her new husband install the toilet. Although our protagonist barely knows how to boil water, she desperately needs an indoor john. As she steps onboard the \\"Savage\\" and greets Ivan, something happens to both of them that never surfaced during the house signing. Sparks fly!! Bigtime!

I picked up Kate Pepper's \\"Seven Minutes To Noon,\\" curious to see if she was able to capture the urban Brooklyn setting I am so familiar with as a New Yorker. She does indeed succeed in bringing the area vividly to life - Carroll Park, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill with its green and leafy brownstone-lined streets and upscale shops, the results of many gentrification projects which have sent real estate prices soaring. The book would be near perfect if Ms. Pepper's suspense thriller storyline mirrored her flair for descriptive writing. Unfortunately, it does not. Her writing is laborious and the pace plods. The conclusion is weak, not very credible at all, and threads are left dangling. Truthfully, beach reads like this one are a dime a dozen on today's market. (This is not a derogatory statement about light fiction. I am talking about quality and being a selective reader). This novel is mediocre, at best. From her descriptive style, character development, knowledge of children and the ability to capture their antics on the printed page, I think Kate Pepper is talented enough to improve her storytelling, tighten up her narrative, pick up her pace considerably and come up with a winner. This one is definitely not!<br /><br />The plot basics concern Alice Halpern, homemaker, shoe store co-owner, mother of young Peter and Nell, wife to Mike, and pregnant with twins on the way. She waits to have coffee with friend Lauren, also pregnant, in her last month. They planned to meet in Carroll Park today and then pick up their children from school together. Lauren doesn't show. And when she finally does, she is a corpse, the baby torn from her womb and missing. Later the police mention to Alice that her friend is not the first pregnant woman to go missing in the neighborhood. As the story progresses, Alice begins to fear for herself and her unborn babies. As she approaches her ninth month she senses that she is being stalked. As her previously safe middle class existence turns into a world of nightmares, keeping the twins safe becomes her overwhelming priority.<br /><br />I think the audience for this type of \\"domestic\\" mystery is limited to women, since much of the narrative not dealing with crime is devoted to pregnancy, birth, child rearing, women's friendships and midlife crises, etc.. I  really cannot recommend \\"Seven Minutes To Noon,\\" but will take a look at Kate Pepper's next novel when it hits the shelves.

Sharon Pywell's beautifully crafted debut novel, \\"What Happened To Henry,\\" chronicles the lives of the three extraordinary Cooper siblings from early childhood through adulthood in 1960's post WWII USA. The book's recurrent theme is the powerful, haunting memory of the devastation at Hiroshima, in the aftermath of the atomic-bomb drop of 1945 that brought immediate or horrifically lingering death to more than 140,000 people. The A-bomb, which the Japanese called \\"pika-don,\\" did not simply kill, maim and injure masses of people and destroy buildings. It obliterated all the living and the community of the living. It devastated society and wrecked havoc on the environment. This year, 2005, is the 60th anniversary of  Hiroshima's and Nagasaki's annihilation. The subject is introduced into the narrative in a subtle manner, and gives one pause to reflect on the impact the atomic bomb had, not only on Japanese and US children, but on children everywhere, who grew up in the days of the Cold War, with threats of nuclear missile attacks as a backdrop to their lives.<br /><br />The Coopers are a middle class family of devout Catholics who live in a the suburban community of Eleusis, NY. It is 1960. Lauren, the middle child, is having a problem getting through First Communion. She is the only nine year-old in the class. A \\"First Communion failure,\\" this is the third time she repeats the curriculum but will hopefully receive the sacrament soon, along with her seven year-old classmates. She had been foiled on her initial attempt by multiple streptococcus infections. Her fate was sealed on her second shot by a bowl of salted peanuts she found lying on the kitchen table. Lauren had a momentary lapse of memory about fasting before receiving the host. Her older brother Henry witnessed her downfall, so she couldn't lie. Thus, she continues to study catechisms with the stern, feisty, ever practical Sister Leonarda, hoping to succeed and get it over with. Lauren really struggles with the logic and veracity behind transubstantiation, martyrdom and heaven, especially when the sister makes pronouncements like, \\"Those who believe that they can evade judgment are generally struck down by trucks or disease before they can receive the sacrament of Extreme Unction.\\" Lauren has good reason to question these beliefs, as the reader will discover.<br /><br />Winston, the youngest Cooper is seven and a little hellion...or perhaps \\"tyrant\\" would be a more apropos description. When his wishes, which become his commands, are not fulfilled, or when his feelings are hurt, he dismantles everything in sight, and is quite effective in his destruction skills, being mechanically and electrically inclined. Winston compulsively takes the protective coverings off wall sockets and rewires everything. He is always absconding with his father's tools, like the hacksaw he smuggled into his bedroom to saw his bed's headboard in half. Annie Cooper, the children's mother, is distraught by her son's behavior and can never quite understand what possesses him. Warren Cooper, the family's father, an engineer working in the Research and Development department of a large defense corporation, admonishes his son for using a hacksaw to cut wood. He is upset that his son picked the wrong tool for the job. Lauren bitterly complains to older brother, Henry, that Winston gets away with murder.<br /><br />Twelve year-old Henry is the family's pillar of strength and stability. Lauren adores him and depends on him emotionally for his wisdom, strength of character and level-headedness. She has a recurring nightmare in which she watches a man in a cornfield shoot Henry. The dream always ends with Lauren holding his body in her arms, thinking, \\"...I don't know the way.\\" Even the inscrutable Winston responds to his big brother. Other than being kind, insightful and creative, Henry is a normal pre-adolescent boy, who is into building model fighter airplanes from WWII. His collection hangs in his roomin simulated fight patterns. He is a bit obsessed, however, with looking at the photographs in a library book entitled, \\"Disaster, Disaster, Disaster,\\" which graphically documents the horrors of the Hiroshima bomb! The picture he is most fascinated by is of a Japanese man with his arms outstretched, running toward a terribly burned woman - toward the blazing inferno caused by the bomb, not away from it.<br /><br />In 1958, when the Cooper kids were ten, seven and five respectively, a terrible tragedy hit the family hard. By December, 1962, everyone had seemingly recovered from the emotional aftermath of the event which left them bereft. The Cooper method of getting their lives back on track is invariably the same - never discuss the problem, and repress, repress, repress.

This is truly a beautifully written novel. The author ably pulls off Henry and Asagao communing in the spirit world to such an extent that their relationship becomes more realistic than any diagnosis of pathological illness.

He is a bit obsessed, however, with looking at the photographs in a library book entitled, \\"Disaster, Disaster, Disaster,\\" which graphically documents the horrors of the Hiroshima bomb! The picture he is most fascinated by is of a Japanese man with his arms outstretched, running toward a terribly burned woman - toward the blazing inferno caused by the bomb, not away from it.     In 1958, when the Cooper kids were ten, seven and five respectively, a terrible tragedy hit the family hard. By December, 1962, everyone had seemingly recovered from the emotional aftermath of the event which left them bereft. The Cooper method of getting their lives back on track is invariably the same - never discuss the problem, and repress, repress, repress.

Bruce S. Feiler's literal quest for a spiritual connection to the Torah, (the Pentateuch), that he studied as a boy, resulted in a ten-thousand mile journey in which he retraced the steps of his Biblical forefathers across three continents. His friend and guide, renowned Israeli archaeologist Avner Goren, accompanied him on his travels through Turkey, Israel, the Palestinian territories, the Nile Valley, the Sinai Peninsula and Jordan, visiting the legendary scenes of the greatest stories ever told. In an interview, Feiler once said that he had always thought of the Bible \\"as this foreboding black book with gilt-edge pages.\\" When visiting Israel, before making this trip, a close friend was pointing out places of interest, (an understatement)! \\"Over there,\\" he said, \\"is the rock where Abraham went to sacrifice Isaac.\\" It dawned on Feiler that he was not in Disneyworld or Kansas! He realized the places mentioned in the black book's gilt pages are real - one can see, and feel them. The idea came to him then to \\"retrace the Bible through the desert and read the stories along the way.\\" And along the way he found himself using the \\"Bible as a Baedeker.\\"<br /><br />Bruce and Avner trekked by foot, car, jeep, camel and rowboat in order to examine archeological evidence, get a feel for the geography of each place, interview hundreds of people from Bedouins to pilgrims and tourists, consider historical theory, study and contemplate theology and religious myth, in their attempt to put the Biblical narrative into a historical and cultural context. Together they search for the  \\"real\\" Mount Sinai, where it is written that God revealed Himself and subsequently delivered the Book of the Covenant to Moses.The location of this sacred mount is up for debate. At least twenty-two mountains have been put forth as the real thing. Mr. Feiler makes the point that, \\"...the lack of identifying details points to another, perhaps more consequential factor: The less Mount Sinai is associated with a physical place, the more it is perceived as a spiritual place.\\" He says that Sinai is not only a place, it is a \\"metaphor for the covenant between Israel and Yahweh.\\" He also quotes a rabbinic midrash, (Jewish commentaries on the Hebrew Scriptures compiled between A.D. 400 and 1200 and based on exegesis, parable, and haggadic legend), saying that the world's mountains once quarreled over which one would play host to God. Each extolled its own virtues except for Sinai, which said humbly, \\"I am low.\\" God finally announced: \\" My presence will rest on Sinai, the smallest and most significant of all.\\" The rabbis note that in its modesty Sinai resembled the humility of Moses who did not want to become his people's leader.<br /><br />To me the best parts of this book include the author's comments, like the above, which really give life, zest (!), to his experiences. The conversations between Feiler and Goren, their insights, along with the wonderfully rich interviews conducted with Jews, Christians, Muslims, and humanists, scholars, archeologists, local historians, and bystanders at many of the locations - some of these people, perhaps, descendents of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs - really make \\"Walking The Bible\\" special and distinguish it from travelogues and other books of this type.<br /><br />The book is divided into five parts which correspond, not to the Five Books of Moses, but to five geographical areas where significant Biblical events took place: \\"The God of Our Fathers,\\"  revolves around Jerusalem and nearby sites; \\"A Coat of Many Colors,\\" Egypt; \\"The Great and Terrible Wilderness,\\" Sinai; \\"The Land That Devours Its People,\\" also Sinai  and the Negev Desert - the dependency of man on his fellow human beings for survival in the desert really impressed Feiler. Remember, the tribes wandered Sinai for forty years. As the joke goes, if Moses' sister Miriam had been the leader, she would have asked for directions (!); and \\"Toward The Promised Land,\\" Jordan.<br /><br />The author's vivid and detailed descriptions, especially of the people he meets, are outstanding. Yes, his writing leaves something to be desired, but to tell the truth, I was so absorbed in his adventures, I hardly noticed. It is certainly not bad writing. He is telling a tale of adventure - old and new, not competing for the Pulitzer. His research and documentation are meticulous. Feiler relates to Abraham in a way which touched me deeply. He writes, \\"Abraham was not originally the man he became.... He was a traveler, called by some voice not entirely clear that said: Go head to this land, walk along this route, and trust what you will find.\\"<br /><br />I am so glad that I journeyed vicariously with Bruce Feiler and Avner Golen.  For an amazing voyage of discovery, I recommend you take the trip yourself!<br />JANAand detailed descriptions, especially of the people he meets, are outstanding.

Away for the weekend recently, I picked up a copy of Faye Kellerman's \\"Day of Atonement\\" in the guest bedroom's book basket, (nice touch), and found it to be an intriguing and refreshingly delightful mystery. I really do like noir, but have, perhaps, been reading too much of fiction's dark side lately. This is a terrific change of pace. Although Ms. Kellerman's novel has its share of gruesomeness - a boy's disappearance, a psychopathic killer, etc. - the ethnic/cultural aspect of the story is as unusual as a sleuth series which focuses on family values.<br /><br />\\"Day of Atonement\\" is the fourth in the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus novels. However, one can easily get to know the characters and their history without having read the prior books. Peter Decker, a detective with the Los Angeles police, and his new bride Rina Lazarus are spending their honeymoon in Boro Park, Brooklyn, at the home of Rina's ex in-laws. Rina, an Orthodox Jewess had been widowed early in her first marriage and has two small sons. The couple and their boys are visiting for the High Holy Days, allowing the grandparents time with their grandchildren while Peter is still on vacation. Although Peter's birth mother was Jewish, he was raised as a Baptist and recently converted.<br /><br />During the New Year dinner celebration, Peter is shocked when he comes face-to-face with a family secret, a bizarre coincidence which shakes him to the core. He has to put on his detective hat, however, even if he is discombobulated. As the meal begins, and then ends, it becomes apparent that a fourteen year-old boy is missing. Noam Levine, a relative of the family they are visiting, is a troubled youth, a real loner. Decker is called upon to use his best investigative skills to find the boy, who is in serious danger. Suspense builds as clues are discovered which show just how perilous Noam's situation is. Subplots involve Peter's past, along with his relationship with his new wife, sons and the community he has inherited through marriage. As Yom Kippur nears, (the holy Jewish Day of Atonement, a time for reflection and for forgiveness), all the narrative's various threads come together for a riveting climax.<br /><br />Along with a compelling mystery, Ms. Kellerman provides a fascinating look inside an insular religious community trying to live according to the dictates of their faith. The three-dimensional characters come to life on the page. Both Rina and Peter grow individually, and as a couple, within the story. The chemistry between them is palpable. Rina is a particular appealing character. After a secular upbringing, she chose to become Orthodox. Her newly found independence, (a result of her relationship with Peter), her time as a single parent, and coping with terrors from her past combine to make her an individual well worth meeting. The novel's setting, and background are factual and handled with respect.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery, the humanity of the story and the characters, and details of the Orthodox Jewish customs and lifestyle. As a matter of fact as I finish this review I am about to pick up another book in the series.<br /><br />JANAas inherited through marriage.

This is a stand-alone novel, and one can easily get to know the cast of characters and their history without having read the prior books. Ms. Kellerman's Decker/Lazarus novels are a terrific change of pace from my usual fiction reading. Although these have their share of violence, gruesomeness and unsavory individuals, the ethnic/cultural aspect of the stories and the sheer humanity of the characters are refreshing.<br /><br />Peter Decker, a detective with the Los Angeles police, is still courting Rina Lazarus, an Orthodoz Jewish widow and the mother of two small sons. Raised a Baptist, Peter is studying with Rabbi Aaron Schulman to become a Jew, but at times has doubts about the course he has chosen. He and Rina are very much in love. Apart from her beauty, outside and in, Decker is drawn to her total lack of guile. Rina, who in no way wants to pressure him, needs to find out how committed her finance is to their relationship and to becoming an observant religious man. She has taken her boys back east, to visit with her ex in-laws in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Late one night, thinking of Rina thousands of miles away, Peter is unable to sleep and takes a drive into the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. He finds an adorable toddler wandering around by herself in the early morning hours. After checking with people in the near-by housing complex, he determines the child to be lost or abandoned. When he gets her into the light, Decker discovers she is wearing blood-soaked pajamas and is covered in bee stings. He is concerned that something has happened to the little girl's parent(s) or guardian, since the blood does not seem to be her own. He feels for the bewildered child and is determined to find her family. His partner, Marge Dunn, places their small charge in foster care while they look for the relatives. Their search is relatively short, but what they find will lead them into a long and horrific investigation concerning a family feud turned violent, an overabundance of passion and death. No spoilers here!!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Abel Atwater. an old buddy from his Vietnam War days appears in need of help. Atwater lost a leg and some of his sanity in the war. Now it appears he has been charged with the rape and mutilation of a prostitute. He swears he is innocent. Peter has some doubts.<br /><br />The author deftly handles the workings of various intense personal relationships and solving multiple crimes with apparent ease. As with the other Kellerman book I read, her characters are her strength. They are truly three-dimensional and their dialogue is extremely realistic - at times just plain funny, at others quite moving. Her mysteries are solid. No loose threads are left behind. I plan on reading more of this excellent author's work and highly recommend it to others.<br /><br />JANAwhile they look for the relatives.

Martin's remarkable \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" series. The novel picks up seamlessly where \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" left off. The story deepens and becomes more complex as, (at least), four claimants battle for the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms and unimaginable darkness and disaster threaten from the North. This riveting, multi-layered epic saga reads, in part, like superb historical fiction, (the novel is based more on history than on legend or myth), and in part like dark fantasy, with a huge cast of vivid, well developed human characters - and a few of the supernatural kind also. As with the first book, there is an Appendix at the back of the novel with the names of all the royal houses, their kings, queens, knights, histories, and mottos.<br /><br />The ten year-long summer of peace has come to an end, and the darkness of a harsh, frigid winter is about to descend on the now splintered Seven Kingdoms. An ominous blood red comet, thought by some to be an omen of evil, by others a portent of good, blazes across the sky. In just a short period, war has ravaged the land. King Robert Baratheon, and Lord Eddard Stark, enforcers of thirteen years of peace, have been murdered - victims of political treachery in the game of thrones. Robb Stark of Winterfell has been proclaimed King in the North and battles, along with his liegemen and their armies, against the Lannisters, while dead King Robert's brothers, Stannis and Renly Baratheon, fight each other for crown and throne in the South. The House of Lannister attempts to hold on to their power through young heir apparent, Jeoffry Lannister Baratheon, the child of incest, who rules like a tyrant from King's Landing. His evil, manipulative mother Cersei and his uncle, Tyrion, the dwarf, dominate the sadistic young king and rule through him. Tyrion, called the Imp, tries to check his nephew's arrogance and cruelty and his sister's power plays. At one point he comments that he is all that stands between the family and the population, who despise him, and chaos. Deadly political intrigue is the name of the game at court.<br /><br />King Balon Greyjoy, of the Iron Islands, has marshaled his forces in his own play for power. Meanwhile, major armies are massing against King's Landing from all points on the map, and from various sources, all with their own interests at stake. There is an extraordinary battle scene which occurs during the last 200 hundred pages that is detailed, intense and mind-boggling in scope and creativity. I don't like military/war/battle descriptions, yet I was absolutely riveted to the page. This is really superb writing!<br /><br />Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons and royal heir from the previous dynasty, plans, from a continent away, to travel with her unlikely brood across deserts and wastelands to take back the crown that is rightfully hers.<br /><br />Sansa Stark, Robb's sister, is held captive at King's Landing waiting for an opportunity to escape. Arya, the second Stark sister, is making her way north, toward home, disguised as an orphan boy. She is traveling with a band of miscreants destined for the Night's Watch in the far north. Back at Winterfell, the two youngest Starks, find themselves confronting a friend turned mortal enemy. And Jon Snow, the illegitimate son of Eddard Stark who is serving in the Night's Watch, discovers an invasion of a more heinous nature. Evil, destructive forces, far more deadly than thousands of mounted armed knights and soldiers, are mobilizing to wreck havoc on the land and civilization. Powers as old as the earth itself are preparing to move. Jon is a member of the contingent led by Lord Commander Mormont, (father to the disgraced Ser Jorah), who travel in the menacing frozen wilderness, north of the tower, in search of the lost Benjen Stark, and the King Beyond the Wall.  But the dire danger in the North is ignored or forgotten as feudal lords vie for supremacy and wage waramongst themselves.<br /><br />New characters are introduced in \\"A Clash of Kings,\\" among them Lady Melisandre, a priestess of a god known as the Lord of Light. She has ensorcelled Stannis Baratheon and the powers she wields are terrifying.<br /><br />Martin's prose is fluid and extremely well written. Compelling plots, subplots and counterplots are interwoven throughout as the characters go about their lethal quest for power and wealth. The descriptions are so vivid and three dimensional that this alternate world, one that in many ways resembles Europe during the Middle Ages, is really brought to life on the printed page. The author does not shy away from the brutal realities of civil war. There are appalling abuses of physical and governing power, frightening scenes of battle and strife, where the innocent civilian population is abused and horribly victimized. However, the narrative also includes spellbinding adventure, romance, war, battles, knights and their ladies, quests, infidelity, love, honor, incest and treachery, etc..

Karen Robards' work used to represent the best of contemporary romance fiction. However, her last few novels indicate that Ms. Robards, like many authors in the romance genre, is going the formula fiction route. The freshness, originality, complex, riveting storylines and compelling characters which used to be Ms. Robards' trademark, have been lacking in her recent novels. I bought \\"Bait\\" in good faith and looked forward to reading it over a recent weekend that had rain in the forecast. Well, it rained all right, but the book provided no distraction from the poor weather.<br /><br />You already know the plot. You have read it before, probably many times. A smart, savvy, attractive, independent, (etc.), businesswoman/professional is: either assaulted, or is the potential victim of a serial killer, or gets into serious trouble of another kind. Enter a sexy, macho ( but politically correct), lawman, (FBI or police homicide detective or perhaps a Navy SEAL or CIA agent), to capture the bad guy(s), keep our heroine safe and out of trouble, and propose to her...or at the very least move in with her at the story's end. That's the formula. And that's \\"Bait.\\" Ho-hum.<br /><br />\\"Bait's\\" bare bones has lovely \\"honey-eyed\\" Maddie Fitzgerald, the CEO of a fledgling advertising agency based out of St. Louis, visiting New Orleans on business. She and one of her employees, ad executive Jon Carter, are make a presentation to the bigwigs at Brehmer's Dog Chow Company - a pet-food manufacturer. The account is worth $10 million and could mean a major break for Maddie's new business.<br /><br />Unfortunately the night before the dog and pony show, Maddie is almost murdered in her hotel room by a vicious serial killer. Enter sexy, sardonic FBI agent Sam McCabe and his chubby, cherubic partner, E.P. Wynne. The killer has been playing cat and mouse with Sam ever since he began the murder spree. He calls McCabe and leaves clues about the next murder victim, then challenges the agent to solve the puzzle and rescue the targeted victim within a certain time frame. Maddie is not cooperative with the FBI at all. She is stressed by her near death experience, and under even more pressure about winning the pet food account. Then there's her hidden past. Nothing new here either...except I cannot believe the author actually used the word \\"whacked\\" when referring to a mob hit! Give me a break. This is so not the \\"Sopranos.\\". Maddie does recognize immediately, however, that she is attracted to and disconcerted by McCabe. When she returns to St. Louis, she is attacked again. Yep! He misses her twice!! A more forceful McCabe pays another call on Maddie, and plans to use her as bait to catch the killer. You know the rest!! (or should if you use just a smidgeon of imagination).<br /><br />Truthfully, \\"Bait\\" is substandard reading. And it is not just the formulaic plot that I object to. Ms. Robards' characters are as flat as cardboard. The plot is minimal and not a substantial subplot in sight. There's some cutesy humor involving the Brehmer's mascot dog Zelda, but at this point I felt too condescended to as a reader to crack a smile. Well, you get the gist. I advise you to save your money and your time. I would so much rather see less of an author - no one should crank out book after book, year after year, if there is nothing new and exciting to write, in order to please publishers, fans or pocketbook. Isn't a writer's good reputation worth its weight in gold?

Since its inception, the Project has been dedicated to celebrating, documenting and promoting poetry's role in Americans' lives.<br /><br />\\"An Invitation to Poetry: A New Favorite Poem Project Anthology\\" is the third volume of Pinsky's publicly and critically acclaimed series in which Americans, from ages 5 to 97, from many states, of diverse occupations and education, are asked to submit their favorite poems and to explain why the poem is important to them. Some of the readers' comments are as moving as the poetry itself.<br /><br />The work included in this volume represents poets from all over the world throughout the centuries. The enclosed documentary DVD, which is a companion piece to this compilation, features twenty-eight contributors reading their own selections along with an introduction by Pinsky. The readers range in age and background from two 11-year-olds to 97-year-old former Poet Laureate Stanley Kunitz to a Supreme Court justice. One of the segments that really moved and inspired me is by a Vietnam War Veteran who cries in front of the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D. C., while reading \\"Facing It\\" by Yusef Komunyakaa: \\"I go down the 58,022 names / half-expecting to find / my own in letters like smoke.\\"<br /><br />I found many of my own favorites in this extraordinary collection. I was also introduced to several wonderful new poems I might never have read otherwise.

Edgar Award-winning author Edward Liss returns with \\"The Coffee Trader,\\" another elegantly written historical suspense thriller. In 1659 the bustling port town of Amsterdam was filled with refugees from the Spanish Inquisition, as well as schemers and rogues from all over Europe looking to make some gulden (guilder). The Dutch, after defeating the Spanish, turned their small country into a major economic power in Europe. Amsterdam became the most financially dynamic city in the world, thanks to the robust commercial activity of their commodities exchange, the world's first.<br /><br />Miguel Lienzo, a Portuguese Jew, escaped the Inquisition on the Iberian peninsula and moved to the much more tolerant Netherlands. He created a home within the city's close-knit Sephardic Jewish community. Sharp-witted, and a bit of a rogue himself, Miguel thrives on the exhilaration of the Dutch bourse, but his trades of late have not gone well. On the brink of financial ruin due to sudden shifts in the sugar market, he enters into a partnership with a seductive, entrepreneurial Dutch widow with an eye for business, Geertruid Damuis. Together they concoct a daring plot to corner the market on a new commodity - coffee. Lienzo's plan has him going up against a powerful enemy, Solomon Parido, who sits on the Ma'amad, the Jewish self-governing body which controls all aspects of community life. Miguel had been betrothed to Parido's daughter, until his unfortunate lack of discretion caused the relationship to end, earning him Parido's lasting enmity. If Lienzo fails, he will not only be ruined but exiled as well...and nothing would please Parido more.<br /><br />Liss meticulously recreates the 17th century Dutch city. He brings Lienzo's world to life in great detail, as well as the workings of the Amsterdam bourse which are strangely similar to modern commodities markets. The complex, labyrinthine storyline, chock full of intrigue, is really compelling, and his characters are three dimensional in scope. Miguel, actually, is a surprisingly nuanced figure.<br /><br />I found myself drinking more coffee than usual while reading this novel. Something about the narrative had me smelling freshly ground coffee beans constantly. Imagine a world without Starbucks! One part of \\"The Coffee Trader\\" that I really enjoyed, amongst many, is the Europeans' astonished reaction after their first taste of this bitter, stimulating brew, and their realization that fortunes could be made with the beverage. Lienzo even foresees a day when taverns, serving coffee, will spring up on every corner. Imagine that?<br /><br />JANAdimensional in scope.

Three authors who greatly influenced the direction of the English novel also happened to be sisters, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Bronte. Charlotte's \\"Jane Eyre,\\" Emily's \\"Wuthering Heights, and Anne's \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,\\" extraordinary novels all, comprise this Oxford University Press edition. The people, events and settings which marked these young women's lives, as well as their vivid imaginations, impacted their writing significantly.<br /><br />Charlotte Brontë consciously tried to achieve financial success from the family's literary efforts. She wanted to make her living as a writer, and her goals were the most professional of the three. Her novel \\"Jane Eyre,\\" a dark gothic romance, is the story of a governess and her passionate love for her Byronic employer, Mr. Rochester. It is ranked among the great English novels. There are many recurring themes here, some of which are repeated in other works by Charlotte Bronte: relationships between men and women and their different roles and limitations in society; relations between social classes; religion and morality; the need to fulfill the desires of others versus the necessity to maintain one's personal integrity; the conflict between reason and passion, and, of course, Jane's deep need to love and be loved. However, primary to the tale is the magnificent, complex character of Jane herself.<br /><br />Long before the women's suffrage movement, Miss Bronte created, in the character of Jane, an intelligent, independent, strong-willed female, determined to make her place in the world. Equality between the sexes is not brought up in the novel, neither legally nor politically. What the persona of Jane addresses here is obvious in the following very famous lines: \\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.\\"<br /><br />Emily Bronte is said, by many literary critics, to be the undisputed genius of the family. An uncompromising, enigmatic, almost reclusive personality, she produced only one novel and a few poems, yet she is ranked among the giants of English literature. \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" her masterpiece, is the wild, passionate story of the intense love between Catherine Earnshaw, another intelligent, independent, strong-willed heroine, and the gypsy-like foundling Heathcliff. This novel, however, is much more than a love story. \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is about hatred, cruelty, delusion, frustrated yearning, deep despair and vengeance. At times its very darkness is depressing and painful. Yet love and faithfulness, which endure beyond death, bring hope and much needed light to this tale; as does a second love story, born from the seeds of the first. The author also addresses the issues of social class here. Emily's powerful prose, its very beauty and energy, make the book such a literary classic. Charlotte published \\"A Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell\\" in 1850, in which she explained the morbidity of Emily's work by referring to the \\"horror of great darkness\\" in her life.<br /><br />Of the three extraordinarily gifted Brontë sisters, Anne has been judged the least talented. I say, look at her competition, and her short lifespan. I also think her novel \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,\\" about a young woman's marriage to a dissipated, villainous rake, is brilliant. Some of the behavior described in the narrative is apparently taken from events which Anne witnessed when she worked as a governess. She openly stated that in \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" she, \\"wished to tell the truth, for truth always conveys its own moral to those who are able to receive it.\\" This well written, extraordinary tale can most definitely hold its own against the works of her sisters, and those of other noted authors of the period. Both \\"Agnes Grey\\" and \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" have been wildly praised for their realism and integrity.<br /><br />All three girls were born in Thornton, England in the early 1800s. Their father Patrick, was a poor Anglican clergyman. He and his wife had six children. The two oldest daughters, Maria and Elizabeth died before reaching adulthood. Their brother Patrick Branwell, was just a year older than Emily. Shortly after Anne's birth their father accepted a position in Haworth, located within the Yorkshire moors, a wide, wild, vast, uninhabited wilderness which was to have a major effect on all three women's writing. Emily loved walking the moorlands with her dogs, so much so, in fact, that she became desperately unhappy when away from home. She was extremely introspective, and preferred the outdoors to the company of her peers. Thus she made few friends. Her intensity of character is evident in \\"Wuthering Heights.\\"<br /><br />When Mrs. Bronte died, soon after reaching Haworth, the children were cared for by their maternal aunt. Charlotte and Emily were sent to Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire but they returned within a year. The treatment at Cowan Bridge was very harsh, and Charlotte later modeled Lowood School, (\\"Jane Eyre\\"), after it. \\"The food was poor and insufficient and they were treated with inhuman severity.\\" The two oldest sisters, Maria and Elizabeth, actually died as a result of the conditions and the sickness contracted there. Charlotte's fiction is full of motherless and orphaned heroines whose loneliness is frequently the driving force behind their search for a place of belonging<br /><br />For the next several years, the Bronte children were taught at home. They were extremely inventive and creative with their games and imaginary stories. Charlotte attended Miss Wooler's school at Roe Head for one year in 1831, then returned home and taught her sisters. She went back to the Wooler's school to teach in 1835, but after bouts of depression and poor health, she resigned from her position. Again, Charlotte draws material from this experience to use in Jane Eyre.<br /><br />Charlotte, Emily and Jane collaborated on a book of poems, published at their own expense, entitled \\"Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell.\\" The pseudonyms were chosen to match the first letter of their names. In 1847 Anne's \\"Agnes Grey\\" and Emily's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" were published together in three volumes. Although her first novel, \\"The Professor\\" was rejected, Charlotte's \\"Jane Eyre: An Autobiography\\" was an immediate success. Oddly, Currer Bell was identified as the editor rather than the author. The subtitle was dropped in subsequent editions.The popularity of the Bronte novels allowed Anne's \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" to be published shortly thereafter. The sisters' identity as authors was at first unknown, even to their publishers. It was not until after the publication of Charlotte's \\"Shirley\\" in 1849 that the truth was made public. By the date of this last publication, the Bronte's family life was to be tragically destroyed.<br /><br />Branwell Bronte, an unstable man with a history of alcohol and opium use died in September 1848. Emily then fell ill and died of tuberculosis December 19, 1848. Anne soon followed, contracting tuberculosis that same year and dying May 28, 1949. Charlotte continued to live virtually alone at Haworth. The three sisters are almost as famous for their short, tragic lives as for their novels.<br /><br />Charlotte published \\"Villette\\" in 1853. During this period, Charlotte also accepted an offer of marriage from her father's curate Arthur Bell Nicholls and on June 29, 1854, she and Nicholls were wed. She became quite ill with toxemia during pregnancy, complicated by the Brontë susceptibility to tuberculosis. She died March 31, 1855. Her first novel \\"The Professor \\"was published posthumously in 1857, and a fragment from an unfinished work entitled \\"Emma\\" was published in 1860.<br /><br />Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bronte were writers destined to have a tremendous impact on English literature.

Eudora Welty, winner of the National Medal for Literature and the Pulitzer Prize, paints a haunting, lyrical portrait of the enormous Fairchild clan at Shellmound - their rustically feudal cotton plantation in the 1920's Mississippi Delta.<br /><br />The family has gathered for the wedding of Dabney, the second and prettiest daughter, (in her particular generation), and Troy Flavin, Shellmound's overseer, a ruddy-haired man who is totally unsuitable, in the eyes of various family members. However, nothing is expressed verbally to indicate their displeasure. Their attitudes, the way they live and treat each other, say it all.<br /><br />It is late summer, and the festivities are underway in the semi-tropical heat which hangs heavy over the river and bayou. Nine year-old Laura McRaven, a cousin whose mother just died, arrives for the celebrations on a trial visit, of sorts, that will decide whether she is to become a permanent member of the clan, or be sent back to her non-Fairchild father in Jackson. The plot is a simple one, however, the novel's pattern of relationships are most complex. The characters' reveal themselves through their actions, conversations, soliloquies, and sometimes through the perceptions of young Laura, as they all deal with the issues which unite and divide them.<br /><br />Welty's sensitive story vividly portrays the charm and customs of old Southern family gatherings of yesteryear, and explores the complexities and chaos associated with close-knit families. The author literally invites the reader, most hospitably, into Shellmound and beckons us to join the festivities.<br /><br />\\"Delta Wedding\\" was Ms. Welty's first novel, published in 1946.

Powerful and moving, \\"The Mill on the Floss\\" is considered to be George Eliot's most autobiographical novel. Along with \\"Middlemarch\\" it is my favorite. Set in early 19th century England - St. Ogg's, Lincolnshire to be exact - this is the tale of gifted, free-spirited Maggie Tulliver and her selfish, spoiled brother, Tom, who were born and raised at Dorlcote Mill on the River Floss. Eliot's portrayal of sibling relationships is terribly poignant and plays a major part in the novel, as does the longstanding rivalry between two local families - the Tullivers and the Wakems.<br /><br />From earliest childhood Maggie worships her brother Tom, and longs to win his approval, and that of her parents. However, her fierce intelligence and strong streak of independence bring her into constant conflict with her family. She finds, in literature, the kindness and love she longs for in life. \\"...everybody in the world seemed so hard and unkind to Maggie: there was no indulgence, no fondness, such as she imagined when she fashioned the world afresh in her own thoughts. In books there were people who were always agreeable or tender, and delighted to do things that made one happy, and who did not show their kindness by finding fault. The world outside the books was not a happy one Maggie felt. If life had no love in it, what else was there for Maggie?\\" Her nature, complex, passionate, sensuous, noble, intellectualized, and spiritualized, is of great importance to this novel, as is the pathos of her relationship with Tom.<br /><br />Maggie's early years are brilliantly and unsentimentally portrayed from a child's perspective. The author structures a sequence of childhood's phases, which might appear, at first, to be random vignettes, but constitute an excellent psychological basis on which to build a character and motivation. Eliot once stated, \\"my stories always grow out of my psychological conception of the dramatis personae.\\"  Thus, the author chronicles Maggie's life as she grows from a precocious little girl to a strikingly attractive young woman, tall with full lips, and a \\"crown\\" of jet black hair. Her lack of social pretension makes her even more charming and likeable. As she matures, her conflicts with her brother, her family, even with her community, increase significantly. She, herself, feels torn between what is considered her \\"moral responsibility\\" and her search for self-fulfillment. Ultimately, she demonstrates honor and courage in the face of the disapproval of a narrow, tradition-bound society.<br /><br />Parallel to, and intertwined with Maggie's story, is that of families Tullivur and Wakem. After Tullivur loses his mill and social respectability through bankruptcy, (a loss precipitated by a rash lawsuit he undertook), Wakem purchases it all. Mr. Tullivur agrees to stay on as manager. At first he seems resigned to his misfortune. However, within the space of a few pages he is swearing vengeance on the new owner and cursing him. He actually summons Tom to inscribe his curse on Wakem in the family Bible, and makes his son swear to uphold it. The feud becomes violent when Wakem, in the role of proprietor, appropriately corrects Tullivur's management of the mill. Of course the criticism is taken as an insult, and shortly afterward, upon meeting his boss on the road, Tullivur horsewhips him  in \\"a frenzy of triumphant vengeance.\\" Tom sees this uncontrolled outbreak of madness as the result of long repressed hatred. Mr. Tullivur never repents his beating of Wakem. His injured pride and sense of righteous indignation, justify him in his own mind. This lack of forgiveness is also demonstrated by Tom for his sister. In direct contrast, Maggie couples love with forgiveness.<br /><br />As she reaches adulthood, Maggie finds herself torn between her relationships with three extremely different men: her proud, stubborn brother, Tom; Philip Wakem, a beloved friend who is also the son of her family's worst enemy; and a charismatic but unacceptable suitor. When Tom is thrown suddenly into the role of adult, after his father's death, he becomes obsessed with acquiring social status and power. He attempts to arrange a socially advantageous marriage for Maggie, and when she refuses, he severs ties with her.<br /><br />I won't spoil your read with any further discussion of the novel's details, especially the dramatic conclusion. George Eliot writes with a keen sense of humor, especially when addressing the grotesque in the human character. Her narrative has great depth, as insight to character and social observations are more important to Eliot than pace and action. \\"The Mill On The Floss\\" is deeply romantic - a work of great beauty and a literary classic. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />\\"The Mill On The Floss\\" is based partially on Eliot's, (born Mary Ann Evans), own experiences with her family and her brother Isaac, who was three years older than she. Eliot's father, like Mr. Tulliver, was a businessman who had married a woman from a higher social class. His wife's sisters were rich, ultra-respectable, and self-satisfied.

In this, his latest book, after \\"The Years With Laura Diaz,\\" the author returns to the magical world of fantasy, and to some of his favorite themes: creativity and time.<br /><br />Gabriel Atlan-Ferrara, a dynamic and celebrated symphony conductor, reflects back on his life, at age 93, and realizes that only death awaits him. These reflections reveal his great passion for one woman, and for music. They also disclose the conductor's view of the world, and destiny, as he confronts death. \\"El muerto no sabe lo que es la muerte, pero los vivos tampocos\\" (\\"The dead don't know what death is, but neither do the living\\"). The past holds for him the memory of his love for the red-haired, dark eyed Inez. Gabriel has a shimmering glass seal, a mysterious object \\"sufficient unto itself.\\" This seal might bestow upon its bearer the ability to see past, present and future, to hear music of impossible beauty, and to read unknown languages. The maestro hopes to find, in the crystal seal, the impossible reflection of Inez and a return to a time when they were together - to transcend time, distance and space through their love.<br /><br />The crystal also provides the link between two intertwining stories - that of Atlan-Ferrara and his memories, and a parallel narrative which records Inez' dreams - a poetic love story telling of the first encounter in human history between a man and a woman. \\"Inez\\" is an extraordinary tale which contrasts love and obsession, life and death, male and female.<br /><br />Alan-Ferrara encountered Mexican opera singer, Inez Prada, three times over the course of his lifetime. The first time was during the 1940 London blitz. This was when he initially heard her sing. In 1949 they met again in Mexico City. She had become a renowned diva. Atlan-Ferrara had moved-up in his career also, and was now one of the world's most important orchestra conductors. Their last meeting took place in London, 1967, when the conductor decided to break all the rules of traditional opera. Each time they met they were performing Berlioz's opera, \\"The Damnation of Faust.\\" It is \\"the opera that permits me to travel in time...,\\" Fuentes said in an interview. \\"It is Berlioz who invents this original dissonance, this extraordinary mystery of the origin of music and the origin of voice.\\"<br /><br />Fuentes also stated that Alan-Ferrara is \\"modeled on one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, the Romanian Sergiu Celibidache.\\" The young Mexican soprano, Inez, Fuentes says was inspired by the legendary Maria Callas.<br /><br />Margaret Sayers Peden's translation is excellent and captures Fuentes' language as well as any translation could.<br /><br />Carlos Fuentes, probably Mexico's greatest living writer, is the author of more than twenty books and has received many awards for his accomplishments as a novelist, essayist, and commentator, among them the Cervantes Prize in 1987. Major themes in Fuentes' work are the power of fantasy, national identity, and the promise and failure of the Mexican revolution. Fuentes has frequently been mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize for literature.

Martin's remarkable \\"Song of Fire and Ice Quartet.\\" This is a riveting epic saga which reads, in part, like superb historical fiction, (the novel is based more on history than on legend or myth), and in part like dark fantasy, with a huge cast of vivid,  well developed human characters - and a few of the supernatural kind also. The conscientious reader need not stay up at night studying in order to become acquainted with all these personages. There is an Appendix at the back of the book with the names of all the royal houses, their kings, queens, knights, histories, mottos, etc.. This story is narrated by multiple individuals, including: Lord Eddard (Ned) Stark, his wife, sons and daughters, Tyrion Lannister - an incredibly rich character, and Daenerys Targaryen Stormborn, the last daughter of the Dragonkings who had ruled the Seven Kingdoms for three hundred years.<br /><br />The setting for much of Martin's \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is the Seven Kingdoms, a feudal realm which has a recorded history that goes back 8,000 years. The author takes us to a period and place where dragons' eggs might still hatch, under certain conditions, although a dragon has not been sighted in centuries. Magic is dwindling. The old gods are worshiped with equanimity, alongside the new. Seasons and weather are different from what we experience. Summer can last for years and then disappear suddenly, giving way to the dreaded, seemingly eternal winter, with its killing cold, icy winds and blizzards.<br /><br />One king rules all seven kingdoms from his Iron Throne in the Red Keep at King's Landing. He is paid homage by the lesser kings and/or lords. Thirteen years ago, a civil war deposed the Targaryen Dynasty, and mad king Aerys was overthrown by Robert Baratheon of Storm's End, and Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and the northern reaches. Robert reigns as King now, but his taste for wine, women, and weapons holds his interest more than attending council meetings and dispensing justice. He has grown fat and bleary-eyed, a major disappointment to his friends and those who fought for him. His wife, Queen Cersei of the House of Lannister, has little time for her husband. Her true love is for power. Cersei's Lannister family, an avaricious and ambitious bunch, are not content to remain in their present positions as powerful royals. They want the crown. If King Robert were to die, Cersei would become the young king's regent. Cersei's twin brother, Ser Jaime, aspires to the most powerful position at court - although he is already a member of the elite Kingsguard. Jaime Lannister had been sworn to protect King Aerys once, but in fact was the one who murdered him - and thus he is called Kingslayer. The royal court is presently filled with intrigue, plots and rumors. Consqeuently, the realm is in turmoil. Queen Cersei has a terrible secret which could bring down the entire House of Lannister, if she does not take the initiative and eliminate her enemies. The \\"King's Hand,\\" (right-hand man), is murdered because of his knowledge. King Robert is so dismayed at the assassination that he travels north to Winterfell, to personally ask his childhood friend and companion-at-arms, Eddard Stark, to take the position, vacated so abruptly. This is not the first time Robert has asked Eddard for assistance. It was Stark who helped him win the crown.<br /><br />Eddard is not cut out for politics or court life. He wants to remain with his wife and family in the North, at Winterfell. Although ice and snow have not covered the land for decades, winter is about to return with a vengeance and Stark senses the danger. An honorable man, Stark rules as his ancestors have done for countless generations. Now however, the entire realm is in turmoil, and though he believes his duties lie at home, he cannot refuse his king. Thus, he enters the game of thrones, where one is said to either win or die. In any case, all are losers here - forthe real threat lies where no one is looking.<br /><br />The Wall that separates the Seven Kingdoms from ancient forested wastelands and tundra lies just north of Winterfell. It is beyond that Wall, that the true danger lurks - evil, destructive forces far more deadly than thousands of mounted armed knights and soldiers are massing their forces to wreck havoc on the land, and civilization. Powers as old as the earth itself are preparing to move. The men of the Night's Watch, who are sworn to guard the Wall above all else, are being slaughtered. Meanwhile, the Seven Kingdoms prepare for civil war, even as the guards in black send messengers southward asking for help. But the dire danger in the North is ignored or forgotten as feudal lords vie for supremecy and bicker amongst themselves.<br /><br />Across the sea, Viserys Targaryen, the heir of the previous dynasty, marries off his sister, Daenerys, to a powerful chieftain in exchange for promises of an army to win back his realm, the Seven Kingdoms. Aided by Ser Jorah Mormont, a knight exiled by Lord Stark, Daenerys will eventually seek to revive the ancient legacy of the Dragons.<br /><br />Martin's prose is fluid and extremely well written. The narrative is riveting! Plots, subplots and counterplots are interwoven throughout as the characters go about their lethal quest for power and wealth. As I mentioned briefly above, the story is narrated by various individuals offering multiple points of view. Since no human being in the novel is totally evil, or purely good, this is an effective literary device, especially in a book of this scope, to allow the reader to glimpse a hero's bad points, or a villain's good qualities. The descriptions are so vivid and three dimensional that this alternate world is really brought to life on the printed page. I was particularly amazed by the drama and originality of the room where the enormous black skulls of the Targaryen dragons are stored.  Exceptionally imaginative writing!  And the three multi-colored, jewel-like petrified dragon's eggs that Daenerys is gifted with on her wedding day - again, the descriptions and the fate of these objects are quite unique. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a long book, at 807 pages before the Appendix. However, I just kept on turning them, one after another, and lost track of time. This is a spellbinding and compelling novel of adventure, romance, war, battles, jousts, knights and their ladies, quests, infidelity, love, honor, incest and treachery, etc.. Get the picture?

To me the book has always epitomized the best of gothic fiction. The narrative is filled with intensity of feeling, especially Heathcliff's passionate love for his Cathy and hers for him - a love which endures beyond the grave. More than would be lovers, however, the two are soul mates and have been since their childhood. Cathy once told Nelly, her servant and friend: \\"My greatest thought in living is Heathcliff. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be... Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure... but as my own being.\\"<br /><br />Yet, the novel is more than a love story. \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is about hatred, cruelty, delusion, frustrated yearning, obsession, deep despair and vengeance. At times its very darkness is depressing and painful. Yet love and faithfulness, which endure beyond death, bring hope and much needed light to this tale; as does a second love story, born from the seeds of the first. The author also addresses the issues of social class here. Both Linton and Earnshaw families are considered gentry. However, the Linton's are a more educated, cultured group and appear to be of a higher class than those who reside at Wuthering Heights. Some of Catherine's most crucial decisions involve moving up in society.<br /><br />The story is told in a series of narratives, none of which are entirely reliable. During the winter of 1801, a gentleman named Mr. Lockwood rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire. He has a natural curiosity, and in time visits his neighbor and wealthy landlord, Heathcliff, a grim, forbidding man who lives at Wuthering Heights, a few miles from the Grange. Lockwood also makes the acquaintance of Heathcliff's housekeeper Ellen Dean, called Nelly, and asks her to tell him about her employer and the history of those who reside at Wuthering Heights. He documents her narrative in his journal, and his written recollections make up the main portion of the novel. Much of Nellie's tale consists of memories from years before, her observations of life with the Earnshaw family, her recollections of the Lintons, and her own conclusions, which are subjective. Lockwood, gets his information second hand, from Nellie's perspective. He continually interprets, and misinterprets the relationships and actions of the characters who play such major roles here. So, it is up to the reader to make sense of it all - which is what the author intended.<br /><br />As a young girl Nelly worked as a servant at Wuthering Heights for Mr. Earnshaw, the owner, his wife, and their two children, Hindley, and Catherine. Earnshaw returned from a business trip to Liverpool with a gypsy-like urchin, a dark-haired, handsome orphan boy. He had taken quite a fancy to the lad, a quiet, stoic child, and names him Heathcliff, after a son who died. Earnshaw decides to raise him with his own children. Catherine befriends Heathcliff almost instantly. They share a love of nature, and an emotional intensity unknown to most people. They are able to communicate with each other easily, even as young children, and both possess tremendously creative imaginations. The two roam the moorland wilderness, where they're most at home, like wild creatures of nature, and become inseparable friends. Hindley detests Heathcliff from the first. He is jealous and goads the boy constantly. Eventually, after the death of his wife, Mr. Earnshaw begins to show preference for Heathcliff over his own son, which exacerbates the hostility. Finally, Hindley is sent away to school and Heathcliff is kept at home, at Earnshaw's side.<br /><br />Hindley comes into his inheritance some years later, at age twenty, when his father dies. Cathy is eleven years-old, and Heathcliff about twelve, when the heir returns to Wuthering Heights, and seeks viciousrevenge for having his rights usurped by a wretched boy from the slums with no means of his own. Obviously Heathcliff cannot defend himself and is totally dependent on Hindley. He is forced to work as a laborer in the fields, and is treated harshly, as less worthy than an animal. He and Cathy maintain their closeness. They still wander the wild North country and she shares her studies with him. One night they pay a clandestine visit to Thrushcross Grange, home of the Linton family. Cultured, spoiled and very well behaved, young Edgar and Isabella live there. When a dog savagely bites Cathy, it is discovered that she and Heathcliff have been hiding in the brush spying. The girl is seriously injured and is forced to stay at the Grange for several weeks to recover. During her time with the Linton family, Mrs. Linton becomes intent on turning wild, mischievous Cathy into a young lady. She encourages her to become a young woman with manners and actions appropriate to her social standing in society, rather than the wild, headstrong creature she is while roaming the moors with Heathcliff. By the time Catherine returns home, in elegant new clothes, she has become infatuated with Edgar Linton. Needless to say, her relationship with Heathcliff deteriorates significantly, as he feels he is losing the only person he ever loved.<br /><br />Edgar pursues Catherine relentlessly, and eventually, the young woman's desire for social advancement, and an inexplicable fey, self destructive quality about her, prompt her to accept his proposal. However, she really does not love her fiance. She may care for him, but her feelings are much less than what her passionate nature requires. On the other hand genteel women of this period were supposed to have neither \\"passionate\\" nor intense feelings. \\"'Here and here!' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast: 'in which ever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!'\\" Thus Catherine acknowledges to Nelly that her marriage to Edgar cannot be one of love. Although she knows that Heathcliff is her true love, however, she cannot marry him because he has been so debased by Hindley. \\"It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightening, or frost from fire\\". Her powerful connection to Heathcliff is always present, no matter how annoyed she becomes with him. Heathcliff leaves Wuthering Heights a bitter man. He knows that if he had come from a better social class, or had wealth, Cathy would have married him. When he finally returns, years later, a self-possessed, successful, wealthy man, he is obsessed with revenge, and is more adept at exacting it than Hindley ever was.<br /><br />Nelly continues her increasingly complex tale, (which I won't spoil for you), of three generations: of births, marriages, deaths, traumas, complications, a second more hopeful love story and redemption. The most recurring theme is the great love and friendship, the everlasting connection, between Cathy and her Heathcliff, whose difficult nature is almost impossible to understand and to accept - unless, of course, one thinks about his unknown origins and early childhood as a homeless waif in Liverpool. One can only imagine the horrors he experienced wandering the streets of the rough port town, with neither protection nor kindness. What cruelty and meanness of spirit did he learn there? His terrible, inhuman treatment at Hindley's hands certainly played a part in Heathcliff's lust for revenge and lack of mercy, as did Catherine's decision to marry Linton, which must have been devastating for him. Heathcliff remains a dark, brooding, cruel man throughout his adult years and never reforms. He is an anti-hero, at least in my eyes, as he alsopossesses good qualities, along with a terrible sadness, an emptiness and longing which he shows to Cathy alone.<br /><br />Emily Bronte's extraordinary prose is filled with powerful imagery. Miss Brontë spent most of her short life at home, in Thornton, Yorkshire, where she was happiest. She loved the surrounding moors - the wide, wild expanses, unsuitable for cultivation, and full of danger. There are bogs and wetlands on the moors, which can go virtually unseen, and where one can drown. It is also a place of great beauty. The author spent much time walking there with her dogs and was terribly unhappy when she was away. The similarities between the author's natural environment and that of the area around Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are obvious. Ms Bronte drew inspiration from the regional Yorkshire architecture also, as well as her own personal experiences and her amazing imagination, a gift Charlotte, Emily, Anne and Branwell Bronte shared - with each other and with us. I have read a few Bronte biographies and always felt that the character of Catherine Earnshaw, certainly her intensity and love of nature, was based on Emily Bronte.<br /><br />Keep a box of tissues handy throughout your reading of \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" I wonder if this is the first tearjerker?<br />JANAatherine acknowledges to Nelly that her marriage to Edgar cannot be one of love.

Of course I have not been there since the 1980's, and imagine much has changed in the ensuing years. I will always remember, however, the magnificence of Guatemala's mountainous northern landscapes, the rich and colorful indigenous culture, the tropical beauty surrounding Lake Atitlan, and the horror of the country's deadly politics.When I heard that Kent Harrington had come out with a new novel, \\"Red Jungle,\\" a noir-ish political thriller set in this exotic Central American country, I knew I wanted to read it. I thoroughly enjoyed the author's \\"Dia de los Muertos\\" and hoped to find a similarly exciting, well written tale here. I am not disappointed.<br /><br />Guatemala, indeed most of Central America, was rife with revolutionary upheavals and repressive violence during the last half of the 20th century. Popular demand for social justice collided with traditional feudal agrarian societies, underpinned by a small elite clique of land-owning families supported by the United States. The rapid expansion of commercial agriculture drove small peasants off the land and into urban areas where they did not have the skills to make a living, and lost their pride in indigenous traditions and their positions of worth in their local communities. The usually conservative Catholic Church became an agent for justice, popular mobilization and change. People demanded democratic reforms in the authoritarian political system, long dominated by landed elites and protected by vicious dictators, the military, and the infamous \\"death squads.\\" In Guatemala the reformist wave was broken by more repression and the mass murder of local populations. The military had long been levying a campaign of terrorism and genocide against these groups, most of them Mayas, in order to distribute native peoples' land among plantation owners.<br /><br />Russell Cruz-Price's journey into the seething politics and secret wars of Guatemala, along with some very unwise decision making on his part, land him in a world of hurt...which, of course, makes for some awfully good reading.<br /><br />Cruz-Price, son of an American businessman and the beautiful daughter of one of Guatemala's elite and powerful families, spent most of his adolescence in the US. While his parents were in the process of divorcing, he was being educated at various military academies. Although he did spend time with his maternal family in Guatemala, Russ' visits came to a halt after his mother, Isabella Cruz, was killed, supposedly in an automobile accident. After graduating from university with a degree in economics, Russell got himself a job as a journalist for an English financial newspaper, based out of Guatemala City. And there is big news to report from Guatemala, financially speaking. The price of coffee is plummeting and Washington cannot stabilize the country's economy. The World Bank and the IMF are chomping at their respective bits to call in loans.<br /><br />Russell recently purchased a defunct coffee plantation, Tres Rios, on Guatemala's Pacific coast, using all his savings and maxxing-out his credit to do so. An acquaintance of his, a fortune-hunting German archeologist, oddly enough named Gustav Mahler, swears he knows that the location of the Red Jaguar, a priceless Mayan antiquity made of red jade, is on Russ' newly acquired property. Evidently his line is a good one, as he was able to convince the bright young financial analyst cum journalist to buy the land, much of it virgin jungle. Cruz-Price's cash investment plus Mahler's expertise is going to pay off Big Time...so he says! Mahler sounds more like a used car salesman than an archeologist, if you ask me. Although he did discover the lost Mayan temple at Bakta Halik, I find his reasoning lacking, and Russ' credulity naive, to say the least. However, having read other Harrington novels, I just figured I'd cut the man some slack, and continue along with the otherwise riveting read. I mean, what is this world coming to if you can't trust a good writer to lead a reader to a place of interest?<br /><br />When Russ is not traipsing around in dense jungle meeting millions of mosquitoes, snakes called \\"Four Steppers,\\" (if one bites you, you can take about four steps before you drop dead), real man-eating jaguars, and members of various paramilitary groups who do not understand what a safety catch is, he is hanging-out with Beatrice, a gorgeous married woman. Unfortunately, this married woman is one of Cruz-Price's poor choices. She is the wife of Carlos Selva, the head of Guatemalan intelligence, and probably the country's next president. And when he's not wrapped around the lovely Sra. Selva, he is seeing Katherine Barkley, an American woman working for the UN-affiliated \\"Houses for Humanity.\\" Or so she says. As one learns early on in \\"Red Jungle,\\" people and events are not always what they seem. Then there's a plot to overthrow the government...but I won't go there here.<br /><br />\\"Red Jungle\\" is pure suspense with Mayan ambiance, and the ever present threat of violence waiting to erupt. There's some good satire thrown in to boot. Kent Harrington creates an almost surrealistic environment, both in city and jungle. He writes a deft narrative and intertwines Isabella Cruz's story, set in the 1970's and '80's, with that of her son's, enriching the tale greatly. His characters, the kind who are believable and those who are not, are terrific - from Gustav Mahler, \\"who looked like Kid Rock and has an IQ of 183,\\" Coffee Pete, a very old CIA guy who decided to go native, the two Guatemalan presidential \\"candidates,\\" eccentric Carl van Diemen, Sr. Carlos Selva, who is drawn to perfection - very subtle on the outside and a latent volcano underneath, to various thugs and bystanders. And Russell Cruz is an extremely complex guy with definite self destructive tendencies.<br /><br />My only complaint about \\"Red Jungle,\\" is that I feel Mr. Harrington could have given more background information about Guatemala's political history, especially since so much of his narrative occurs as a consequence of this history. The inclusion of just a few pages of information, integrated into the storyline, would have given the novel more depth and meaning. Also, the author almost always refers to the opponents of the Guatemalan government, or those fighting for land reform, as Communists. This is a tremendous oversimplification, and unjust to the thousands of people who believed in democracy and struggled, risking their lives and the lives of their families, for a better system. Instead, Mr. Harrington writes of Cuban and Soviet trained guerillas. I wish he had been less cavalier and more clear about the identity of the majority of the opponents to the violently repressive, US backed government and its policies - especially when, in the USA, the word \\"communist\\" conjures up all kinds of monstrous fantasies and conspiracy theories.<br /><br />I would like to mention that aesthetically, the book is beautifully bound and designed - kudos go to Dennis McMillan for excellent work, as usual - and to Joe Servello for the wonderful maps and illustrations.

According to some biographers, Charlotte allowed her husband to read the two chapters she had completed but he discouraged her from continuing. Nicholls, a diligent, serious-minded man, believed that since \\"Emma\\" was about a girl's school where the protagonist suffered, it would bear too much resemblance to \\"Jane Eyre.\\" He was concerned the critics would accuse her of being repetitious. The twenty page draft was put away and Miss Bronte died five months later.<br /><br />Author Clare Boylan was introduced to this fragment of unfinished work by Bronte biographers Lyndall Gordan and Juliet Barker and was inspired to undertake the awesome task of completing \\"Emma\\" - to recreate Charlotte Bronte's post-Romantic, gothic literary style as well as life in Victorian England, and to continue a tale hardly begun. This is not the first time a modern writer has tried to get inside the head and imagination of a long deceased author to write a sequel to a novel, or, as in this case, to complete one. I sincerely admire Ms. Boylan's efforts, but do not think she has succeeded. Although \\"Emma Brown\\" starts off well, and continues to intrigue far beyond Miss Bronte's contribution, halfway through the book the narrative begins to deteriorate.<br /><br />Isabel Chalfont, a prosperous, attractive widow, \\"not young nor yet old,\\" who resides in a rural English village, is our narrator. Three of her neighbors, the pretentious Misses Wilcox, own and teach at Fuchsia Lodge, a school for young ladies. Their enterprise is a small one, just a few students, but the Wilcox sisters are always on the lookout to expand. Therefore they are delighted when wealthy Conway Fitzgibbon, Esq. of May Park, Midland County, deposits his heiress daughter in their care. The mysterious Miss Matilda Fitzgibbon boasts an extremely expensive wardrobe and an \\"insolently distant\\" air. She possesses a plain, weary countenance and looks unhappy most of the time. This may be partially due to the fact that she sleepwalks and experiences strange fits. Matilda neither glories in her finery nor interacts with her peers. She is obviously favored by the Misses Wilcox over the other pupils, because of her wealth and status in society. However, she is indifferent to their pampering.<br /><br />When letters are mailed to the girls' parents asking them if they expect their daughters to travel home for Christmas, the note sent to Fitzgibbon, Esq., is returned unopened. It appears that there is no such place as Midland County and no such person as the addressee. Another neighbor, local bachelor William Ellin, is asked to investigate. And indeed, he takes it upon himself to play detective, but consults with his friend, the level-headed, intelligent Widow Chalfont first. She pities the terrified girl, who seems to have no memory of her past, and offers her a home and affection while they wait for the mystery of her identity to be solved.<br /><br />Isabel tries to draw the girl out, and at times she seems responsive. One morning, however, Matilda goes on an errand and never returns. Her destination and her history are much more shocking then anyone could have imagined. Mrs. Chalfont's story, as well as Mr. Ellin's tale, are interwoven into the narrative, where far too many contrivances and coincidences occur to make for credible reading. The excesses of fate and melodrama are among this novel's weaknesses. Also, during the seemingly never-ending period when Maltilda wanders through the stews of Victorian London, there is just too much repetition. As interested as I had become, I found the reading so tedious I was tempted to put the book down. I am reminded of the silent film episodic serial, \\"The Perils of Pauline.\\" The perils never cease, but the suspense and drama do. I also seriously doubt whether Charlotte Bronte would have written as graphically as does Ms. Boylan about the perversions to be found in the back alleyways of London, especially child prostitution.<br /><br />I find many similarities between \\"Emma Brown\\" and \\"Jane Eyre.\\" I don't think Charlotte Bronte would have gone in this direction. Yes, there is the obvious similarity of the girl's schools, Lowood and Fuchsia Hall, where, when found to be a fraud, Matilda is tormented by her former benefactresses as much as Jane ever was by Mr. Brocklehurst.  I accept that, and these scenes play only a small part overall. However, just as Jane was befriended by Helen Burns, despite her many humiliations, so does the once hostile Diana make friends with and comfort Matilda. Jane finds longed for maternal kindness in Miss Temple, as does Matilda with Isabel Chalfont. There is a governess who falls in love above her station, etc..<br /><br />On a more positive note, the author is obviously familiar with Miss Bronte's writing, including her correspondence. At times I hear the voice she has strived to create throughout. She address effectively some of Miss Bronte's major themes, the search for one's identity, women's forced dependence no matter the social class, and the limited options open to educated but impoverished women. Elements of the story, apart from the girl's repetitive wanderings, are fascinating and certainly held my interest. I just feel disappointed that \\"Emma Brown falls short when my expectations were so high.<br />JANAwritten as graphically as does Ms. Boylan about the perversions to be found in the back alleyways of London, especially child prostitution.

Louis de Bernieres intertwines his beautiful narrative of a small Anatolian town and the lives of its inhabitants with that of the biography of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder and first president of the Turkish Republic. \\"Birds Without Wings\\" is superb historical fiction which chronicles the rise of Turkish nationalism, following the horrific massacres of Armenians and Muslims in the 19th and early 20th century. Similar ethnic and religious mass murders occurred in the Balkans, and other such slaughters were perpetrated by the Russians in their vast territory. Refugees fled in droves into the Ottoman Empire, to life in exile, trying to escape the killing fields. The destruction of the Ottoman empire in WWI put an end to a tradition of religious and ethnic tolerance in Asia Minor, areas of the Balkans, and many Arab countries. De Bernieres also takes the reader to the battlefields of various wars, revolutions and counterrevolutions, and portrays the Battle of Gallipoli from the Turkish point of view - although I don't think he captures the true extent of the horrors of Gallipoli.<br /><br />De Bernieres' dedicates his novel to: \\"....the unhappy memory of the millions of civilians on all sides during the times portrayed, who had become victims of the numerous death marches, movements of refugees, campaigns of persecution and extermination, and exchanges of population.\\"<br /><br />Karatavuk, now an old man and the town scribe, remembers his childhood when he spent almost all his time running free with his beloved friend, Mehmetcik. Of course they both had to spend time at home with family and/or working, but there was always plenty of opportunity to play and adventure. Mehmetcik is a Christian and has long since been deported, with all the other non-Muslims, from his home in the former Anatolian town of Eskibahce, a fictional coastal village carved into a hillside in southwestern Turkey. The refugees were shipped to Greece, to live as strangers amongst strange people who called them Turks, in spite of their shared Greek Orthodox religion.They were transplanted to replace the Greek Muslims, who were transported from Greece to Eskibahce, which was part of the former Ottoman Empire but now belongs to Turkey. In the old days Christian, Muslim, Armenian and Jew lived together in Eskibahce, in relative harmony. Everyone spoke Turkish. Christians learned the Greek alphabet in order to read and write Turkish with Greek letters. Muslims learned to recite the first few lines of the Koran in Arabic, but otherwise remained illiterate. Mehmetcik taught his Muslim friend to read Turkish in Greek, making letters and words in the dirt with a stick, thus enabling him to become a scribe when his arm was crippled by a gun shot.<br /><br />Karatavuk and Mehmetcik are not the boys' real names. Karatavuk's real name is Abdul, Mehmetcik's is Nicos. Iskander the Potter made them terra cotta whistles in the shape of birds. These whistles are extremely special and unique. When half filled with water and blown, they sound like the bird they resemble. Abdul, Iskander's son, received the karatavuk, a completely black bird with a yellow beak which makes a \\"vuk, vuk, vuk sound in the oleander tree and sings to praise God in the evening.\\" Thus Abdul, who whistled and flapped his arms much of the time, fancifully trying to make them function as wings, got his nickname. Nicos received a smaller but beautiful bird whistle also - the mehmetcik, \\"sometimes called kizilgerdan, and sometimes the fire-nightingale.\\" He too became more than proficient in making the bird song. Iskander warned them both, \\" Man is a bird without wings, and a bird is a man without sorrow.\\"<br /><br />Now Karatavuk remembers his old friend and happier days, so long ago. He writes his memories in a letter to Mehmetcik, which the man will never receive, even if he is still alive. No one knows where he is. Karatavak writes that he misses him, even now that his eyes have dimmed and he has grown old. He tells of people they cared for so much and who are long gone from Eskibahce, killed in wars, displaced to God knows where, murdered by ethnic cleansing: wealthy Aga Rustem Bey and his beautiful, mysterious Circassian mistress, Leyla Hanim, who was not Circassian at all; Abdulhamid Hodja, the local imam, who was friend and wise man to Muslim and Christian alike, and came to bless Philothei, a Christian, when she was born; Ayse, the imam's wife and a good woman, who once asked her Christian friend to light a candle before the icon of the Virgin - just in case; Father Kristoforos, who encouraged the Muslims to enter his church on holy days when the religious figures honored by both Christianity and Islam were celebrated. The priest also accepted \\"offerings from Muslims who were anxious to hedge their bets with God by backing both camels;\\"  Veled the Fat who gave his camel cigarettes to smoke; Ali the Snowbringer and his family who lived in a hollow tree; the Dog; the Blasphemer; Ali the Broken-Nosed; Stamos the Birdman; Mohammad the Leech Gatherer; Charitos and Polyxeni, parents of Mehmetcik, and tragic Philothei the Beautiful; Drosoula the Ugly, best friend of Philothei; Sadettin who was forced to kill his sister and then ran away to be a bandit; and Ibrahim the Mad. He also remembers Firket from Pera, and other war comrades - all of them gone.<br /><br />He remembers when, as boys,  they fancied themselves to be birds, and were happy even when they fell. He was a robin, Mehhetcik a blackbird. But in reality they were birds without wings. \\"For birds with wings nothing changes; they fly where they will and they know nothing about borders and their quarrels are very small...But men are confined to earth...and because we cannot fly, we are condemned to do things which do not agree with us. Because we have no wings, we are pushed into struggles and abominations we did not seek.\\"<br /><br />Unlike his other novels, especially my favorite, \\"Corelli's Mandolin,\\" the author introduces and sets in motion a huge cast of characters, who are restricted in their development as a consequence of their large number. They are remembered most for one or two salient characteristics, sometimes charming, occasionally comic, and, as time passes, more and more heartbreaking. Although this device works, and is effective in an epic tale of this proportion, I found something significant lacking here. I wanted to become more intimate with some of the personages - to find out more about them, their thoughts and dreams. This is impossible in \\"Bird's Without Wings,\\" because as in real life, these figures are as grains of sand in the scheme of world events. \\"History,\\" de Bernieres writes, \\"is finally nothing but a sorry edifice constructed from hacked flesh in the name of great ideas.\\" This book is extremely powerful and pertinent now, given global current events, especially the last few years in the Balkans, Middle East, and former USSR.<br /><br />On the down side, although one cannot help but be caught up in de Bernieres' lyrical prose and a storyline packed with adventure, joy and so much sorrow - this novel is too long at 554 pages, 95 chapters, a six part Epilogue and a Postscript. Although I really found it difficult to put the novel down, it is nowhere as fluid or as accessible as \\"Corelli's Mandolin.\\" Nor is the narrative as passionate.

We're not going to see this kind of thing much longer. It already belongs to the past".	Edward Sheriff Curtis dedicated his life's work to documenting the customs and lifeways of the Native American peoples of North America. This extraordinary book includes some of the best photographic examples from Curtis' twenty volume masterpiece, \\"The North American Indian,\\" one of the most significant representations of traditional indigenous culture ever produced.<br /><br />Curtis was one of two official photographers for the 1899 Harriman expedition to Alaska. On his return, he stopped in northern Montana, accompanied by George Bird Grinell, editor of Forest and Stream. There he witnesses the deeply sacred Sundance of the Piegan and Blackfoot tribes, a sight which transformed his life. Grinell said to him at that time, \\"Take a good look. We're not going to see this kind of thing much longer. It already belongs to the past\\". It became clear to him then, that he was to record, with pen and camera, the life of the North American Indian. By the time the last volume appeared in 1930, little remained of the ancient traditions of the peoples he photographed.<br /><br />Beginning in 1900 and continuing over the next thirty years, Edward S. Curtis, sometimes called the \\"Shadow Catcher\\" by tribes' people, took over 40,000 photographs and recorded ethnographic information from over eighty American Indian tribal groups, ranging from the Eskimo or Inuit people in the North to the Hopi people of the Southwest. In the end, the work comprised twenty textual volumes and twenty portfolios with over 2,000 illustrations.<br /><br />\\"Sacred Legacy: Edward S Curtis And The North American Indian\\" was compiled and published to honor the 100th anniversary of Curtis's project to photograph the North America's indigenous peoples, and is a sacred legacy. This impressive volume beautifully reproduces in luminous images 200 of Curtis's greatest photographs from the finest source materials available - a significant number from platinum, gold and silver prints. Christopher Cardozo, an authority on Curtis, carefully selected the photographs for publication and for the accompanying exhibition. Writers who contribute their work here include: Joseph D. Horse Capture, N. Scott Momaday, and Anne Makepeace.<br /><br />The photographs are organized by tribes and culture areas, encompassing the Great Plains, California, the Southwest, Plateau Region and Woodlands,  Pacific Northwest, and Alaska. These reproductions represent an artistic masterpiece worthy of any collection. This volume is a fitting tribute to Curtis's genius.<br /><br />\\"The passing of every man and woman means the passing of some tradition, some knowledge of sacred rights possessed by no other.\\"  Edward S.

Alice Miller's \\"Prisoners Of Childhood; The Drama Of The Gifted Child,\\" was originally published in 1981. A later revised and updated edition, \\"The Drama of the Gifted Child: The Search for the True Self\\" is now available with a new Foreward by Dr. Miller. I read this book over 20 years ago, and recently reread it. I find that it is just as relevant, wise and perceptive today as it was then. Dr. Miller was a practicing psychoanalyst, who gave up her work with patients to write books, for the layperson, primarily dealing with early childhood abuse. In her Forward, Miller continues to disavow psychoanalysis. Although I am not in agreement with her on this, she continues to be one of my heroes.<br /><br />Dr. Miller, who writes an elegant and easily understandable prose, discusses here the issue of children raised by a narcissistic parent(s). She explains that this book is not about high I.Q. children, but about those who were able to survive an abusive childhood because they developed an adequate defense system. At a very early age the child intuitively apprehends the parent's needs. Since the parent, especially the mother, is the child's soul source of survival, the child strives to please, fearing disapproval, or abandonment. Thus, the child sublimates his needs for the parent's. Roles reverse and the child frequently takes on the parent's responsibility as emotional caregiver. This impedes the growth of a child's true identity, and a \\"loss of self\\" frequently occurs. The child adapts by not \\"feeling\\" his own needs, and develops finely tuned antennae, focusing intensely on the needs of the all important other. Ms. Miller writes, \\"An abused child, (emotionally), does not know it is being abused, and in order to survive and avoid the unbearable pain, the mind is provided with a remarkable mechanism, the 'gift' of 'repression,' which stores these experiences in a place outside of consciousness.\\" Although, later in life, these \\"prohibited\\" feelings and needs cannot always be avoided, they remain split off and the most vital part of the true self is not integrated into the personality. The results are often depression, and tremendous insecurity.<br /><br />Alice Miller makes her readers aware of the unexpressed sufferings of the child and the tragedy of the parent(s) own illness. As she frequently states, \\"any parent who abuses a child,\\" knowingly or otherwise, \\"has himself been severely traumatized in his childhood, in some form or another.\\"<br /><br />Gifted children are often the products of emotional abuse by a narcissistic parent. However, if the child's great need for admiration is not met, for his/her looks, intelligence or achievements, he/she falls into severe depression. Miller says one can only be free from depression \\"when self-esteem is based on the authenticity of one's own feelings and not on the possession of certain qualities.\\"<br /><br />Children need a great deal of both emotional and physical support from the adult. According to Miller, this adult support must include the following elements in order for a child to develop to his or her full potential: \\"Respect for the child; respect for his rights; tolerance for his feelings; willingness to learn from his behavior.\\"<br /><br />Miller also writes about the \\"origins of grandiosity as a form of denial and its relationship with depression.\\" Another interesting chapter deals with the \\"process of parental derision\\" and how it results in humiliation and possible psychic trauma of the child.<br /><br />Alice Miller's extraordinary book, along with consistent psychoanalytic psychotherapy, enabled me to understand my past, modify behavior, forgive, and finally, best of all, to heal. I cannot recommend \\"Prisoners of Childhood: The Drama Of The Gifted Child\\" highly enough.<br /><br />JANAlways be avoided, they remain split off and the most vital part of the true self is not integrated into the personality.

It is a personal memoir, recounted as if the author were sitting around a table, with good friends and a bottle of excellent Chilean wine, telling tales of the people, anecdotes and incidents that were so important in his life. \\"Confieso Que He Vivido,\\" means I confess that I have lived. And Sr. Neruda certainly did that...with zest, zeal and so much talent. I read Neruda's book in Spanish, but feel more comfortable writing this review in English. The translation by Hardie St. Martin is a good one, but it does not do justice to Neruda's extraordinary writing skills. He romances the Spanish language, like no other, even with his prose.<br /><br />Neruda was born, the son of a railroad worker, in the then frontier wilderness of Southern Chile in 1904. He led a bohemian lifestyle, dressing in black \\"like the true poets of the last century,\\" during his university years in Santiago. His shyness, the \\"kink in the soul,\\"...especially of women, took him a while to overcome. He describes the people and places of that period with great 'carino' (love). His political ideology began to form at that time also, and politics became an integral part of his writing. The Student Federation, student demonstrations and the subsequent repression, had a great impact on the young intellectual.<br /><br />Neruda led a rich and fascinating life. World traveled, he served as Chilean consul in Burma, Ceylon, and Java. He was the consul in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, and during this time \\"Nine Love Poems\\" from \\"Veinte Poemas de Amor y Una Cancion Desesperada\\" was published. It was at this time also, that his friend Federico Garcia Lorca was killed. Neruda was present in Paris to organize a worldwide anti-Facist congress of writers that would be held in Madrid. His writing about Spain during the war is heartbreaking. Returning to Chile in 1938, he found a burgeoning Fascist movement in his own beloved land.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed his account of the time he spent in Mexico, as consul. He tells of his encounters with the great Mexican painters there.<br /><br />After returning home, Neruda ran for political office and was elected to Chile's Senate in 1945. He was later removed from his Senate seat after joining the Communist Party.<br /><br />His friends included: Garcia Lorca, Ehrenburg, Picasso, Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, Octavio Paz, Miguel Angel Asturias, Gandhi, Nehru, Mao, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and most sadly, Salvador Allende.<br /><br />Pablo Neruda's death, just weeks after the brutal murder of Chile's President Allende, is something I will never forget. I was living in Colombia at that time, and remember where I was and what I was doing when I learned of Allende's death, and later heard of Neruda's passing. It called to mind, then and now, my recollections, as a young girl, when President Kennedy's assassination was announced. I always thought Neruda died of a broken heart.<br /><br />This is an exceptionally good memoir, told with great charm, in a series of vignettes. I highly recommend it, especially to anyone who has read and enjoyed Pablo Neruda's poetry - to my mind some of the most beautiful in the world. It also gives us a glimpse of the politics of the left from the point of view of a Latin American - not the usual perspective, and well worth while.<br /><br />JANA<br /> <br />I particularly enjoyed his account of the time he spent in Mexico, as consul.

A digital wizard, he is a systems operator for an exclusive erotic online service, EROS, (Erotic Realtime On-line Stimulation), which caters to the rich and powerful, who are willing to pay exorbitant monthly fees to maintain their anonymity and privacy. As a sysop Harper can cruise the hundreds of discussion threads within EROS, while his presence goes undetected by the participants, even in private chat rooms. He can also participate in discussions under assumed identities. Drewe, who never minded her husband's job with EROS before, has become uncomfortable with it in recent months. Harper has avoided her sexually, because she wants to get pregnant, and she feels he relieves his frustration online, rather than facing up to their real problems.<br /><br />Karen Wheat, is a famous author and an EROS client with whom Harper is familiar. When she is discovered murdered and horribly mutilated in her home in New Orleans, Harper contacts the authorities. He thinks Karen's death may be connected with a number of other EROS clients who have gone missing - six women in five different states. He contacts the detective in charge of the Wheat case to give the police a heads-up, and to have someone investigate the whereabouts of the women who suddenly dropped out of their prepaid EROS service. Harper gets himself and his loved ones in a world of trouble, and peril, for his noble efforts.<br /><br />The mastermind behind the killing(s) is a dark genius, who does not fit any previously developed profiles for serial killers. He also alters his modus operandi for each murder, which makes him that much more difficult to catch. And he has infiltrated EROS, surfing the privileged Internet service for victims.<br /><br />\\"Mortal Fear\\" is an intriguing suspense thriller. However, it ultimately disappointed me because the narrative meanders so. I like tight writing and taut suspense. Author Greg Iles, a favorite of mine ever since I read \\"Black Cross\\" and \\"Spandau Phoenix,\\" has the necessary elements and talent to create a real winner here, but does not succeed - although this novel does provides much entertainment, if you don't mind the frequently slow pace. The book begins with a bang, that is to say, there are lots of thrills and chills from the start - which is good. However, the pace slows significantly about halfway through. Mr. Iles seems to have forgotten the concept that less is more. He builds suspense to a fever pitch, the tension peaks, begins to fall-off, and we're back to where we started - the psychopathic killer is not captured, the mystery is not solved. The local FBI, their experts at Quantico, and homicide detectives from 5-6 major cities have been made to look totally incompetent, (I have truly never read of such a diverse group of experienced professionals who continually make so many stupid blunders). Meanwhile, the reader has gone through almost 600 pages of the same cyclical storyline - and no one has learned enough to come close to stopping the madman - and his identity is known!!<br /><br />The repetitiveness really does distract from the horror and suspense. Loose threads dangle at the conclusion. Characters, like \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" are introduced, built up, and then disappear - the author loses them - they are not murdered. And Harper Cole acts totally out of character at times. There are frequent tangential philosophical and religious conversations, which at first are interesting, then just provide obvious filler. I would give the novel a 3.5 rating, although that's not possible, simply because there are fascinating sections, especially those which deal with the world of online chatrooms/forums. There is suspense also, but as I wrote, it gets watered down at times. If you're an Iles' fan, and/or the plot sounds interesting, give it a try.<br /><br />JANAa 3.5 rating, although that's not possible, simply because there are fascinating sections, especially those which deal with the world of online chatrooms/forums.

This compelling story is set in Baku, Azerbaijan, the oil rich city on the shores of the Caspian Sea. Depending on one's religion and ethnicity, Baku used to be considered either the easternmost city in Europe, or the doorway to the Orient. Many ancient, aristocratic and fabulously wealthy families, Georgian and Armenian Christians, and Persian Muslims lived here for generations. The Russian Empire, which encompassed both Georgia and Azerbaijan, maintained a tenuous peace, and, in fact, the citizens of Baku formed deep intercultural friendships which went back a hundred years, or more. However, beneath the surface, the conflict between Islam and Christianity seethed in the never-ending struggle for cultural and religious domination. The novel covers the turbulent times from 1909 to 1920, and opens on the eve of World War I, continues through the Bolshevik Revolution, and provides deep insight into the conflicts between Eastern and Western cultures.<br /><br />Ali Khan Shirvanshir, the son and heir of an ancient and noble Persian family is our protagonist and narrator. He was born and raised in Baku, Azerbaijan, in the Trans-Caucasus, at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, Christianity and Islam, modernity and tradition. Ali Khan is finishing his last year of high school as the novel begins. His forty classmates at the Imperial Russian Humanistic High School of Baku are a mixed lot, numbering thirty Mohammedans, four Armenians, two Poles, three Sectarians, and one Russian. Their Russian Professor condescendingly informs his pupils during a geography lesson that it is their responsibility to decide \\"whether our town should belong to progressive Europe or to reactionary Asia.\\" He is not pleased when Ali Khan states his preference for Asia.<br /><br />Ali is fascinated by the secrets, mysteries, hidden nooks and alleys of Baku, his home - \\"the soft night murmurs, the moon over flat roofs and hot quiet afternoons in the mosque's courtyards,\\"  the scent of sea air and the smell of oil. He thanks God that he was born a Muslim of the Shiite faith. He only wishes to live his life and die in the same street, in the same house where he was born - along with Nino Kipiani, with the flashing eyes, who eats with a knife and fork, goes about without a veil, and wears sheer silk stockings. Although young, the two love deeply, their feelings continue to grow and endure in spite of the seemingly insurmountable cultural and religious conflicts that confront them. They are both children of the Caucasus, and their friendship was born on the Caspian shores of Baku.<br /><br />When Ali recounts to Nino the discussion that took place in class and how he had heatedly argued for Baku to remain Asian, Nino says bluntly: \\"Ali Khan, you are stupid. Thank God we are in Europe. If we were in Asia they would have made me wear the veil ages ago and you could not see me.\\"<br /><br />Ali has the soul of a desert man. A friend once told him, \\"The Orient's dry intoxication, comes from the desert, where hot wind and hot sand make men drunk, where the world is simple and without problems. The desert man has but one face and knows but one truth, and that truth fulfills him. The fanatic comes from the desert.\\" This might have been true of Ali if it were not for his great love for Nino, his real life Georgian Christian princess. Their feelings for each other makes them both much more complex characters than they would be otherwise, encompassing a greater wisdom and compassion together than they would have ever been able to alone.<br /><br />A pious friend tells Ali, \\"The woman is just an acre on which the man sows.\\" He reminds Ali that women have \\"no souls nor intelligence. No Paradise or Hell is waiting for a woman. When she dies she just disintegrates into nothing.\\" Ali does not believe this, but begins to feel confused and alienated. Then his father advises him to never forget, when he marries, his wife will live in his shadow. Meanwhile, after the couple's engagement is announced, Nino's father talks with Ali about the necessity for mutual trust and respect in marriage. \\"Man and wife,\\" he says, \\"should help each other by word and deed. And they must never forget that they have equal rights and that their souls are their own.\\"<br /><br />The couple's relationship is at the center of the novel's events, but \\"Ali and Nino\\" is much more than a romance. The story takes the reader on a fascinating magic carpet ride to cosmopolitan Baku; irresistibly beautiful Tbilisi, capital of Georgia; the Karabakh, of western Azerbaijan, where the world's most glorious and hardy horses are bred; Teheran, the ancient, mystical capital city of Persia, and the mountains of Dagestan. We witness the consequences of love and passion; war, political and cultural turmoil, and revolution; honor and disgrace, and the impact of Islam, Christianity, and newly born Bahaism on the times.<br /><br />While reading \\"Ali and Nino : A Love Story,\\" I was reminded of an old saying my grandmother used to repeat, \\"A bird may love a fish, but where will they build a home.\\" Ali and Nino loved each other deeply, were bound by a strong friendship and mutual respect, but in the period in which they lived it was almost impossible for them to find a living environment in which both of them could breathe and be who they were as individuals, as well as a couple.<br /><br />This is a beautifully written novel, both lyrical and powerful in its use of language. What is most strange, is that the author's, or authors,' story is almost as dramatic as that of Ali and Nino. The novel was first published in German, in Germany, in 1937. Paul Theroux, who wrote the Afterword to the Anchor Edition, (the one I have and recommend), calls the novel, \\"....one of literature's foundlings.\\" Apparently, lost and/or forgotten in the chaos of WWII and the aftermath, \\"Ali and Nino\\" was rediscovered in a secondhand bookstore in the ruins of postwar Berlin by Jenia Graman. She read the novel, and struck by the originality and beauty of the story, translated it and saw to its publication - first in England and then in the United States.<br /><br />It is thought that the author, Kurban Said, is actually two people. Lev Nussimbaum was a Jew, born in Baku in 1905 whose family moved to Berlin during the turmoil of the Russian Revolution. Nussimbaum became a journalist and author, and eventually converted to Islam, taking the name Essad Bey. When Hitler became Chancellor of the German Nation in 1933, Nussimbaum moved to Austria where he began an intense friendship with Baroness Elfriede Ehrenfels, also a writer.

It lasted from April 5, 1992 to February 29, 1996.<br /><br />Irena Zaric is, in many ways, a typical  teenager. Irrepressibly energetic, buoyant, funny, loving, she is a star on her high school basketball team, Sarajevo's champions. She wears funky clothes - a gray West German jacket, Esprit jeans, red-and-black Air Jordans, American polo shirts, hecho en Honduras, and sports purple nail polish. Her best friend and teammate, Amela Divacs, blonde and curvaceous, is considered prettier by the local boys, but lithe Irena, with the k .d. lang haircut, is thought to be sexier. She doesn't dwell much on politics, history or culture - she's a jock(!) - there are too many more important things on her mind, like athletics, her friends, acquiring copies of Q Magazine, Madonna, Johnny Depp, Michael Jordan, Princess Di, and the great Croatian player Toni Kukoc. Schoolwork is not a priority, although her teachers are not concerned about her. They know she is intelligent, that her \\"mind has depth.\\" Of course she loves her parents, brother, (who is in Chicago), and grandmother, but like most teens, she takes them for granted. She adores Pretty Bird, her Timneh African gray parrot, who is an outrageous mimic, able to imitate the sounds of the telephone ringing, the doorbell, the refrigerator opening, the vacuum cleaner, and, best of all, the sound of a basketball hitting the hoop.<br /><br />The war begins suddenly for Irena, on a warm weekend in March. Students march for peace and are shot for their idealism. Serb police take off their uniforms and badges and become the \\"paramilitaries,\\" clothed in menacing black. They erect barriers and declare the land beyond, Serb Sarajevo. The Bosnian Serbs, supported by neighboring Serbia and Montenegro, respond to Bosnia-Herzegovina's declaration of independence with armed resistance. They aim to partition the republic along ethnic lines and join Serb-held areas to form a \\"Greater Serbia.\\" The national army is converted into the Bosnian Serb Army, and Irena's family's apartment, the entire Grbavica block of buildings, is appropriated for Bosnian Serb officers.<br /><br />Amela is officially knows as a Serb, Irena a Muslim, although her father recently yelled in outrage, \\"Half (Serb) isn't half enough for them. Yes, them...don't you see? They want 'purity.' My father was a Serb married to a Jew. I married a Muslim whose mother was a Croat. Serb, Croat, Muslim, Jew - what does that make you and your brother? We have no name. And now we have no place.\\" The family decides to go live with Mrs. Zaric, Irena's grandmother and only living grandparent. She lives on the \\"other side of the river,\\" in what is considered Muslim territory. \\"The Miljacka River, which used to tie the city together like a ribbon, now divides it like the edge of a serrated knife.\\" On their way over, bombs falling around them, they are brutally attacked, violated and robbed by men dressed in black - Serb thugs. When they arrive, they find grandmother Zaric shot dead. Life only gets worse. Anyone who was alive, anywhere in the world, during the 1990's and able to read, knows just how terrible, (beyond description), life became for the non-Serbian Sarajevans.<br /><br />Irena's former assistant principal, Dr. Tedic, offers her an innocuous job, ostensibly at the Sarajevo Brewery. There she is trained to be a sniper. Teenage women actually served as snipers for both Bosnian and Serbian forces during the war. Highly disciplined, they performed with excellence, and freed up the men to fight at the front. Irena is trained to aim and shoot at a spot, an object, not a human being. I wonder if that made her work any easier. \\"I'm kind of a pacifist,\\" she confesses to Tedic. \\"So am I,\\" he responds, \\"When the world permits.\\"<br /><br />Author Scott Simon, host of National Public Radio's Weekend Edition with Scott Simon, has coveredten wars, and has won extensive awards for his reporting, including the Peabody and the Emmy. He writes clear, straightforward prose, at times quite lyrical, and frequently moving. Irena's story, which is her city's story, will haunt you. The characters are three-dimensional, so much so that I felt as if I knew them personally by the end of the novel. The gallows humor is wonderful and there is plenty of suspense. I love Irena's parents, former hippies, their hearts filled with peace and love - still. \\"Pretty Birds\\" is compelling, riveting, and ultimately as shattering as the siege itself. My highest recommendations for this extraordinary novel.<br /><br />\\"There is no greater sorrow on earth than the loss of one's native land.\\" --Euripides--<br />JANAfor his reporting, including the Peabody and the Emmy.

Joseph C. Wilson's life as a foreign service officer, Ambassador to Gabon, and Sao Tome and Principe under President George H. W. Bush,  Special Assistant to President Bill Clinton, Senior Director for African Affairs at the National Security Council from June 1997 until July 1998, (responsible for the coordination of U.S. policy to the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa), and the last diplomat to meet with Saddam Hussein in 1990, just before the first Gulf War, is fascinating enough to warrant a best selling memoir, in and of itself. President Bush #41, once hailed Wilson as \\"truly inspiring\\" and \\"courageous,\\" after he gave shelter to more than one hundred Americans at the US embassy in Baghdad, although Saddam Hussein threatened to execute anyone who refused to hand over foreigners.<br /><br />There is much autobiographical material in \\"The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed my Wife's CIA Identity,\\" but this is so much more than the run of the mill anecdotal musings of \\"my life so far.\\" At the heart of this book lies Wilson's controversial story and the allegations which led to Justice Department Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald's ongoing investigation into possible violation of multiple criminal statutes, including the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, which makes it a federal crime to knowingly reveal the identity of a covert CIA agent.<br /><br />In just over 500 pages, Wilson gives a detailed account of his foreign service career which spanned more than two decades. He also candidly discusses the events leading to his decision to go public with his criticisms of the Bush administration. Wilson divides his book into three parts: his time in Africa - in which his love of the continent and its people is clearly evident; his time as the acting ambassador of Iraq on the eve of Desert Storm - which has sections that read like an espionage thriller; and finally the story of his mission to Niger, and the outing of his wife's identity to serve unethical political purposes.<br /><br />Wilson writes of a meeting he was asked to attend at CIA headquarters, whose participants included the intelligence community's experts on Africa and uranium, along with staff representing the CIA and US State Department. According to Wilson, a report \\"purporting to be a memorandum of sale of uranium to Iraq had aroused the interest of Vice President Dick Cheney.\\" Wilson was then told that the Vice President's office had tasked the CIA to find out if there was any truth to the report. He was asked, at this meeting to share with the analysts his knowledge of Niger, uranium, and the Nigerien government officials in charge at the time the contract was supposedly signed - 1999 or 2000. Wilson had not been to Niger in two years, but the Minister of Mines, who would have overseen the uranium sale, if it had taken place, was a friend of his. At the end of the meeting, Wilson was asked if he would be willing to travel to Niger to check out the report in question. He emphasized to the attendees that he was a diplomat not a spy, and that his profile in Africa could hardly be considered a low one. He knew the country, the situation and had the contacts. He thoroughly discussed whom he would meet with and what questions he would ask with the US Ambassador to Niger. You'll have to read the book for further accounts.<br /><br />Now, I think, given the controversy and name calling, that the following is important and is indicative of other similar issues which have been used in a vicious PR campaign to cloud Wilson's allegations, and the purpose of the Justice Department's investigation. Objectively, does it matter if Vice President Cheney's office officially gave Mr. Wilson the assignment? His office tasked the CIA with selecting an appropriate, qualified person to do the job. Does it matter if the director of the CIA personally hired him for the temporary investigatory position? Or a high-level CIA official? Or if he was selected because Valerie Plame, his wife, recommended him for the job? (which Wilson denies). Who hired him is not the point here, nor is whether he could or couldn't get the job on his own, etc. The point is that Joseph C. Wilson would not have been sent to Niger on a fact finding mission if he did not possess the expertise to do the job. Not only was the messenger shot in this case,  so was his wife!!<br /><br />The outing controversy has its roots in the 2003 State of the Union address, when President Bush said, that the British government had learned that Iraq had sought uranium in Africa, a possible indication of Saddam Hussein's interest in nuclear weapons. Mr. Wilson wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times questioning whether the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence to justify the war in Iraq. Had the administration ignored not only his own 2002 report, but two previous inquiries by Barbro Owens-Kirkpatrick, an American ambassador to Niger, and Carleton Fulford, a Marine Corps general, who also found that the Iraq-Niger story was not credible.<br /><br />What follows are the details of columnist Robert Novak's role in bringing Ms. Plame's name to the fore and connecting it with her CIA job, and all the subsequent ugliness. Wilson and his credibility have been attacked on a daily basis. \\"He's just a flamboyant politician, not equipped to discuss yellow cake.\\" \\"She's been photographed by Vanity Fair?\\" (Whatever that means!?). Is it a crime to be glamorous and intelligent? Everyone has read the slurs. I find Wilson's take on all this informative, and can certainly empathize with his outrage, (and his wife's - and mine as a US citizen!), however, this is not the book's strongest section. Much of this information, minus Wilson's unique perspective, is available in the media. The first two parts are outstanding, and the entire narrative is extremely well written. However, I know most will buy or borrow this book because of the seemingly ever present scandal of leaks and lies associated with it.<br /><br />Whatever one's partisan politics, and we all have them, hopefully the American people will unite and condemn anything illegal or unethical that was committed in this altogether unsavory situation. The investigation is still underway, and it will be interesting to see how this all pans out. In the interim, the book makes for a compelling read. It is certainly not boring!

Author Grace Tiffany is a Renaissance scholar who in recent years has written a few excellent historical novels involving William Shakespeare, his life and work. She is a professor of Shakespeare and Renaissance Drama at Western Michigan University and has taught Shakespeare at Fordham University, the University of New Orleans and the University of Notre Dame, where she obtained her doctorate. \\"The Turquoise Ring\\" is a retelling of Shakespeare's controversial play, \\"The Merchant of Venice, from the point of view of five women - most of them characters in the great Bard's original work. Given Dr. Tiffany's background and literary talents, I cannot think of a better person to tell this intriguing tale.<br /><br />A young Spanish Jew from Toledo, Shiloh ben Gozan,  flees Spain and the Inquisition in 1568, carrying his infant daughter, Jessica, with him. His beloved wife Leah was brutally tortured and murdered because she refused to renounce her Jewish faith before the Holy Brotherhood. The only possession Shiloh carries with him, besides some food and goat's milk for the baby, is a turquoise ring his wife had given him upon their betrothal. He travels to Venice to live openly as a Jew and to raise Jessica. However, conditions aren't much better for his people in this new home. They are forced to live in a small ghetto, and wear badges and other identifying symbols of their religion when they leave the restricted area. Although, Venice's economy and trade flourish with the influx of Jewish refugees from Spain, they are still forbidden to own land, and the only work available to them is through usury. In Venice Shiloh's precious turquoise ring is stolen and passes through many hands, effecting all who own it.<br /><br />The narrative begins with Elizabeta Santa Leocadia de la Cerda's story. Her mother Serafina, (originally called Sarah), was a newly baptized Catholic, a Jewess who converted, (called a converso or marrano), and her father an established Christian hidalgo, a wealthy nobleman. Many marranos continued to practice the Jewish religion in secret, although they attended mass regularly and took Holy Communion. Serafina actually did renounce her Judaism and tried to become a true Christian, until she became disillusioned with both Catholicism and her marriage. She told Elizabeta, before she died, \\"The new faith is as hollow as the old. It brought me only wealth and bitterness....and a husband who wanted forgiveness every night. Forgiveness to keep on sinning.\\" Unlike her mother, Elisabeta is not materialistic, nor does social class and position matter to her. She gives up her wealth, noble family name and a life of privilege, to return to her mother's family and marry Shiloh ben Gozan, the man she loves. She takes the Hebrew name Leah.<br /><br />Jessica, daughter of Leah and Shiloh, (called Shylock in Venice), is unhappy with the restrictions of life in the ghetto. Unlike her mother, who died when she was born, she is a superficial, spoiled girl, not interested in learning Hebrew and practicing Jewish laws. She would like to leave the ghetto, wear lovely clothing, marry a Christian and convert. She sees the Virgin Mary as a mother figure and frequently steals away to the cathedral in the Piazza San Marco to pray.<br /><br />Nerissa d'Orocuora, a sensual, earthy woman from Padua, works for the ben Gozan family for a brief period in the Venetian Ghetto, as a maidservant. She and Jessica form a fast friendship. When caught entertaining men in her quarters, Shiloh tosses her out of the house and she promptly finds more enjoyable work for better wages in the houses of the Malipiero as a high class prostitute, a legal profession in Venice. Nerissa is savvy and gets by on her wits. She quickly moves up in the world when she is taken in and kept by prominent and influential Cardinal Grimani. All is well, until Nerissa meets Lady Portia Bel Mente, an eccentric young woman with beautiful hair and a brilliant legal mind. She wears men's clothes so she can attend legal meetings and court sessions, learn and debate. The two become best friends and Nerssia moves to Portia's large estate in Belmont, where she will become her lifelong companion and confidant.<br /><br />According to Portia Bel Mente's father's bizarre will, she must marry, no matter her inclinations, if she is to inherit her parent's money and land, which would then be turned over to her husband anyway.

Members of New York City's Police Scuba Squad discover two headless skeletons, one of which is hideously deformed, in the Humboldt Kill, aka \\"Cloaca Maxima, named after the great central sewer of ancient Rome\\" for obvious reasons. NYPD Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta is called in to investigate the who, why, what, where, etc., of the decapitated corpses, and discovers a link between them and a series of murders plaguing the city's underground homeless population. The violent deaths of the anonymous \\"houseless,\\"  the so-called \\"mole\\" people, have not been a priority for the powers that be, but when one of the corpses is identified as that of a wealthy socialite, priorities change fast!<br /><br />The inability to discover the identity, or the species (?), of the unusually malformed skeleton, leads Lt. D'Agosta to enlist the aid of his old friend, anthropologist Margo Green, an assistant curator at the New York Museum of Natural History, and her former professor and mentor, the retired scientist Dr. Frock. FBI Special Agent Prendergast hooks up with the Doctor, the Lieutenant, and the professor, and they are later joined by journalist Bill Smithback. After finding some fascinating new evidence, the team attempts to discover if there is a link between the mole people's brutal murders, the two skeletons found in the Kill, and the Museum Beast incident of the previous year. It is important to note that \\"Reliquary\\" is the sequel to \\"Relic,\\" and though this reads well as a stand-alone novel, it has strong ties to the first book in terms of plot, and characters. Green, D'Agosta, Prendergast, Frock and Smithback all worked together on the Museum Beast case. Enough background information is woven into this storyline so that one need not be familiar with \\"Relic\\" to enjoy this book.<br /><br />The plot and sub-plots take some twists and turns, but everything leads our diverse team of sleuths and experts downward, deep into the dark maze of abandoned subway tunnels and sewers that lie beneath the streets of New York. One of the aspects of  \\"Reliquary\\" that most intrigues me, is the factual, rather than the fictional. Much of the information included about the world underneath the streets of Manhattan is fact. \\"It has been estimated that as many as five thousand homeless people have lived in the vast warren of underground tracks, subway tunnels, ancient aqueducts, coal tunnels, waiting rooms, disused gas mains, etc., which riddle underground Manhattan. Grand Station alone sits above seven stories of tunnels.\\" The Author's Note contains more information on this subject.<br /><br />I don't want to interject spoilers, so suffice it to say that there are some creepy critters hanging out with the regulars below the Big Apple's glittering sidewalks. One of Margo Green's friends and colleagues, a gifted scientist, had been working secretly, on his own, with some of the plant fibers the now dead Museum Monster needed in order to feed. The man came up with much more than he bargained for, and consequently placed not only the population of New York at risk, but the entire ecosystem of our planet...and worse!! Yoiks!<br /><br />This book starts off with a bang, that is to say, quickly with lots of scariness - which is good. However, the pace slows significantly about halfway through. The concept that \\"less is more\\" is seemingly unknown to Misters Preston and Child. I have encountered problems with their tendency to over-write before. Repetitiveness may cause boredom in the reader, and frequent exposure can take the scariness out of monsters. I think \\"Reliquary\\" is about 50-75 pages too long. The authors build suspense to a fever pitch, the tension peaks, begins to fall-off, and their point is still not made, nor are the mysteries solved. The lack of a taut narrative, really distracts from the horror and suspense. And, I was/am extremely disappointed in the ending. Not credible at all!! Here I have trekked through the smelly sludge of centuries, thirty stories beneath the city surface, seemingly forever, in order to accompany our protagonists, especially Agent Prendergast, who is superb...for this kind of finale??<br /><br />If you enjoy Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, then by all means pick-up a copy of \\"Reliquary.\\" It has its good moments and is entertaining, especially, when exploring the belly of the beast.<br /><br />JANAies, thirty stories beneath the city surface, seemingly forever, in order to accompany our protagonists, especially Agent Prendergast, who is superb...for this kind of finale?? <br />  <br />If you enjoy Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, then by all means pick-up a copy of \\"Reliquary.\\" It has its good moments and is entertaining, especially, when exploring the belly of the beast. <br />JANA	2005-07-17

This novel had the potential to be excellent literary fiction. At times Carlos Ruiz Zafon's writing reminded me of both Gabriel Garcia Marquez's and Jorge Luis Borges' work. My expectations rose dramatically as I began to hope for more than a good read. Instead of great literature, however, the novel became an overlong and predictable bestseller, with a most original premise, some brilliant passages and many flaws.<br /><br />Sr. Ruiz Zafon's extraordinary idea of creating a Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a labyrinthine library where each book awaits someone to choose it and give it another chance to live by making it part of the new owner's life, gave me chills. There existed a possibility, as I read the first chapters, that I might be able to list this as one of my favorite works of fiction. Unfortunately, my disappointment when reaching the novel's conclusion overshadowed the book's many positive elements.<br /><br />Daniel Sempere is a young boy who fears he has forgotten the image of his dead mother's face. His compassionate father, an antiquarian book dealer, introduces him to the book cemetery. Daniel and Sr. Sempere are both memorable and unusual characters, as are many of Ruiz Zafon's other figures. Fermin, a former Republican agent who becomes a second father to Daniel, and Julian Carax, the author of the book Daniel selects, are both extraordinary men. Daniel's choice of books ultimately determines the course of his life, as he tries to discover if the author is still alive and solve the multitude of mysteries surrounding him.<br /><br />The setting, post-WWII Barcelona, is fascinating and Zafon depicts a brooding city in mourning as a result of the atrocities of both civil and world wars. The rich plot and various subplots, filled with passion, obsession and revenge, have such potential but become terribly convoluted and lose coherence at times. There is much too much information given about some of the characters, their rationales, and oddly enough, about an ancient, haunted house. Much of the mysterious ambiance is lost as a result of all the unwieldy description. Here, the concept \\"less is more\\" would have strongly improved the narrative. The entire novel could have been cut by a third, perhaps, and made a better, tighter book without losing any of the story or character development. I am a big fan of long, juicy novels, but the length should have a purpose and enhance the tale. The author has focused more on the melodramatic rather than the literary elements. Some may not care, as this is an excellent read. I did care though, as I see so much more potential here and hope the author lives up to it next time.<br /><br />I do recommend \\"The Shadow Of The Wind.\\" Most will find it highly enjoyable, as did I.

It seems the committee wants to use a section of the grounds for a museum, and is sponsoring this function to raise funds. Francis has never been to a reunion of any kind in his entire life, and certainly never thought to return to this particular hospital, where so many traumatic and painful events occurred. Unsettled, but fascinated, he calls to confirm his attendance before he can change his mind.<br /><br />On a warm May afternoon, wearing his only suit, Francis, now forty-one years-old, takes three buses before arriving at the small New England town where he had spent so much time behind walls and locked doors. Ghosts from the past haunt him as he recalls \\"the tastes and smells of madness.\\" He listens to his past \\"as it swirled around him.\\" The medications he takes daily keep the voices at bay, inner voices he has heard since he was a little boy. Of course, the meds have side effects, some severe, which cause other medical conditions - but the voices are quiet now...and that's the point. Francis is not completely convinced, however, that their silence is a good thing. They never told him to do anything bad, and he doesn't know if he would have obeyed them if they did. In a sad strange way, they offered him sensible advice and kept him company. He never experienced the normalcy of childhood, of growing up with friends, playing sports, dating, because of their presence. Except for the voices, he has always been isolated - alone. But he did make a friend or two at one time - at the hospital. And he reunites with one today.<br /><br />Nappy, who obviously believed he was Napoleon, (most of the time), knows more about the former Emperor of the French than most historians. Another Western State Hospital alumni, he is going to give a speech about the \\"road to recovery\\" in today's program, and is glad to see C-Bird. Of course, he is now aware, all of the time, that he is neither emperor nor general. With chagrin, he admits to the huge number of delusional people who make the same claim to fame as he did. He was not even original in his madness. He confidentially informs \\"C-Bird\\" (the nickname that was given to Francis shortly after he was committed), that he will not discuss the killings in his speech - the killings which were never revealed, never solved, and that still give both men hideous nightmares. Then Nappy remarks, \\"I'll be happy when they tear it down. It was a dangerous evil place.\\" And he asks C-Bird, almost pleadingly, to tell the story.<br /><br />Francis goes home that evening thinking about Nappy's request. He has pens and pencils, but no paper. He does have unadorned, white painted walls. So he pulls an old chair over to the side of a wall, \\"deep in the corner of the room.\\" His long suppressed memories have begun to surface, and he grips the pencil and begins to write.<br /><br />Twenty years ago, a shy, frightened Francis Xavier Petrel arrived at Western State Hospital, in Massachusetts, in the back of an ambulance. He is a schizophrenic who has been guided by voices since childhood. Considered harmless, one day during a family argument, he threatened his parents and sisters with a kitchen knife. This outburst caused his family to commit him to the mental institution, where he is forced to adjust to terrifying and dangerous new surroundings. It is at Western State that he meets the first friend he has ever had - ironically, a man who is most definitely not insane. \\"Peter the Fireman,\\" is a Boston firefighter and arson investigator, who burned down a Catholic church, inadvertently killing a priest and injuring several other people. He believed the church was empty. The priest was a pedophile who preyed on Peter's nephew, and many other innocent boys. The firefighter knew the priest would never be brought to justice, so he took the law into his own hands. He is at Western State for evaluation before standing trial.<br /><br />When C-Bird and Peter find the broken and bloody corpse of a beautiful young nurse-trainee in a suspiciously unlocked storage closet, the hospital's medical director Dr. Gulptilil, and his assistant, the arrogant psychologist, Dr. Evans, are eager to place the blame on the most obvious inmate. Lanky, a paranoid schizophrenic, obsessed with finding and eliminating evil, had recently expressed hostility toward the young woman, but he is not a likely suspect, given the circumstances. However, he is arrested immediately, charged, and incarcerated in yet another institution. As Peter observes, \\"Evil has not been killed. It is right here among us and is as alive as you or I.\\" Both Doctors Gulptilil and Evans do not want to explain their policies nor have their decisions scrutinized. They fear that further police and state investigation will bring out information about the brutal, substandard manner in which the hospital is being run, which would jeopardize their jobs.<br /><br />Massachusetts profiler and state prosecuting attorney, Lucy Kyoto Jones, recognizes clues from the crime scene photographs which makes her think she has a serial killer-rapist on her hands - one she is very familiar with. There have been murders in three different parts of the state, with the exact same modus operandi. Not only does Ms. Jones believe Lanky is innocent of the crime, she is almost positive that this repeat killer has managed to conceal himself as a patient in the asylum. The man probably is considered harmless enough, especially medicated and sedated, that he is allowed occasional access to the outside world - perhaps furloughs to spend weekends with family. Lucy remembers Peter from former cases. He has testified frequently for the prosecution against suspected arsonists. He asks to help her investigate, and has the skills she requires. She respects him, regardless of the circumstances in which she find him, and accepts. They just have to find a way to bamboozle Dr. Gulptilil and Dr. Evans into cooperating.<br /><br />Peter also wants to work with C-Bird, to the young man's great surprise. No one has ever wanted to do anything with him before, or be around him at all. The question for Lucy and Peter is, how does one find a psychopathic serial killer masquerading as a madman in a world populated by the insane? Peter recognizes that Francis is able to understand the inverted rationale of an insane asylum, and see into the minds of the mentally ill. In this world of madness, he is a better profiler than either Lucy or Peter.<br /><br />As his need to concentrate and write with accuracy become stronger, Francis goes off his medications and begins hearing voices again, and hallucinating about the murderer the patients called \\"the Angel.\\" The well-written, fast-paced, unputdownable narrative moves back and forth between life and events at Western State Hospital, twenty years before, in 1979, to the present, with Francis dedicating all his energies to documenting the story, at last. By bringing the truth to light, he hopes to resolve and put to rest the memories and fears which still stalk him.<br /><br />I have the highest praise for Mr. Katzenbach's novel. He has not only created a brilliant suspense thriller, but has written with great sensitivity, humor and poignancy about the world of the insane. His most unusual characters come to life on the page, and I so liked and cared about many of them, as much as I hated Dr. \\"Gulp-a-pill\\" and Mr. \\"Evil.\\" Francis, is one of the most sympathetic, intelligent narrators I have \\"listened to\\" in a long time.

I first read Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" the summer between 4th and 5th grades. I was absolutely riveted by the story and characters and clearly remember sitting on the porch steps, my nose in the book. I cried when I reached the conclusion, because I was afraid that I had just read the best book in the world, and that I would never find anything else as good. The local librarian convinced me otherwise. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough - for people of all ages. It will always have a special place in my heart.<br /><br />Ms. Alcott writes about four young women, living in New England, during a period of much strife in America - the Civil War. They are self sufficient, creative and well educated, and each chooses a different life path, traditional and non. Considering the period when the book was written, the author's views on opportunities open to females, restricted though they were by society, is refreshing and liberating. Of course, this was not my focus as a nine year-old. The novel is long, but that never bothered me as a young girl, or much later when I reread it. I didn't want the story to end, actually.<br /><br />Sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March and their beloved Marmee, (who offers her daughters guidance, comfort and unconditional love), learn to live in genteel poverty while their father, a doctor, is away treating wounded soldiers. This beautifully written classic, chronicles the girls' adolescence through womanhood, with all their trial, tribulations, and joys.<br /><br />Much of the novel focuses on Jo, the second daughter, and a gifted writer. She is very much a tomboy, and an avid reader who writes plays which the girls act-out with delight and exuberance. When they meet their new next-door neighbor, the wealthy, lonely Theodore Laurence, (called Laurie), they befriend him and invite him to become the only male member of their exclusive theater ensemble. Laurie becomes an important person in all of their lives, and the March family in his. Margaret, (Meg), the oldest, is quite lovely - a young woman with traditional values and tastes. Sensitive Elizabeth, (Beth), is the most fragile sister -quiet, caring and timid. And Amy, the youngest, is a gifted artist, with a tremendous sense of self-importance.<br /><br />Together they cope with their father's absence and their fear for his safety, severe illness in the family, a death, lack of money precluding many of life's small luxuries, romance, love, marriage and many glorious adventures. In the second part of the novel, Meg marries, Jo's writing becomes a priority, as does Amy's art. During a time of impoverishment, they learn how good it feels to give to those who are much needier than themselves. This aspect of the book is very moving. Ms Alcott brings her characters to life on the page. All of them, even minor personages, are extremely well developed.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" was first published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. The author drew from her own childhood experiences to dramatize the lives of the March family. The character \\"Marmee\\" is based on her own mother, Abigail May, (Abba), Alcott, whom she described as having: \\"A great heart that was home for all.\\" Like Marmee, Abba was loving and passionate about women's rights, temperance, and abolition. A truly compelling and wise novel!<br /><br />Anne K. Phillips, associate professor of English and assistant head of the English department at Kansas State University, is co-editor of the Norton Critical Edition of \\"Little Women\\" and \\"The Louisa May Alcott Encyclopedia,\\" along with Gregory Eiselein, professor and director of graduate studies in English at Kansas State.<br /><br />Phillips was awarded a University Small Research Grant in January 2002 to examine the first editions of \\"Little Women\\" at the Houghton Library at Harvard University, in connection with the development of the Norton Critical Edition.<br /><br />This edition also provides the authoritative, accurate text of the first edition (1868-69) of \\"Little Women,\\" accompanied by textual variants and explanatory annotations. Backgrounds and Contexts\\" includes a wealth of archival materials, among them previously unpublished correspondence and Alcott's own precursors to the novel. Twenty nineteenth-century reviews provide critiques and seven modern essays represent a variety of critical theories used to read and study the novel. A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are also included.<br /><br />This is an outstanding edition and the additional academic information makes for richer reading and study.

Henry VIII was one of the most powerful monarchs in British history, who ruled England in unprecedented splendor. He has long been one of my favorite historical characters, as have three of his six wives, Katherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn and Katherine Parr. For better and for worse, he was certainly a larger than life figure. (quite literally so - at his death, he was obese). I know of very few fictional personages who are as complex and fascinating as this man, (and the women who attracted him). Born to Elizabeth of York and King Henry VII on June 28, 1491 in Greenwich Palace. Henry was a second son and not expected to rule. But rule he did. He became heir to the throne on the death of his elder brother, Prince Arthur, in 1502, and succeeded in 1509. Sir Thomas More once said of him, \\"If a lion knew his strength, it were hard for any man to hold him.\\"<br /><br />Henry was highly intelligent, and, as a youth, quite athletic. Described by a contemporary: \\"He speaks good French, Latin and Spanish; is very religious; heard three masses daily when he hunted ... He is extremely fond of hunting, and never takes that diversion without tiring eight or ten horses ... He is also fond of tennis.\\" He wrote books and composed music, and was a lavish patron of the arts. As the author of a best-selling book, which went through 20 editions in England and Europe, attacking Martin Luther and supporting the Roman Catholic Church, Henry was given the title \\"Defender of the Faith\\" in 1521 by the Pope.<br /><br />\\"The second half of Henry's reign was dominated by two major issues, very important for the future of England and the monarchy: the succession and the Protestant Reformation, which led to the formation of the Church of England.\\" Women and the role they played in the King's life, impacted many of his policies and actions - but the Protestant Reformation and the succession, in particular, had their roots in Henry's relationships with women. He was perhaps England's most infamous monarch, especially when it came to matters of lust, love, marriage, and the unusually cruel and ruthless ways he invented to terminate soured relationships. He was married to six distinctly different women. Author Alison Weir chronicles Henry VIII's metamorphosis from vibrant young prince to despotic, paranoid old king through his marital history, in this richly detailed and meticulously researched composite biography. She has used many public records, diaries, diplomatic sources, and personal letters of the early 1500's to offer a comprehensive, factual version of the private and public lives of Henry VIII and his wives.<br /><br />Ms. Weir writes, with great elegance, wit and insight, about each of the women, and how their lives impacted their times and history. She also describes each of these complex women, their unique characters as individuals, (not just as consorts to a king), their motivations and ambitions. She outlines their ascent and decline, and how they related to one another, their peers and families...and to their husband.<br /><br />Catherine of Aragon dominates the first part of the book, but that is to be expected. She was married to Henry for 24 years, and prior to their marriage, she was wed to his older brother Arthur, a cause for future problems for the realm and much heartbreak for Catherine. Queen Catherine is portrayed most sympathetically, and that is my inclination also. She was a noble lady, raised to serve as Queen, who loved her husband, almost as much as she loved God and the Catholic Church. I have always wondered how Henry's character, his country and history would have changed if Catherine had born him a healthy son. One of the most poignant sentences in history, is one of Catherine's last. As she lay dying, she dictated a letter to the husband who had so ruthlessly abandoned her. She bid her scribe to write: \\"Lastly, I make this vow, that mine eyes desire you above all things. Farewell.\\"<br /><br />Anne Boleyn was an extremely well-educated, and very independent young woman, especially given the times. And Henry was obsessed with the idea of possessing her. Anne played his obsession to the hilt. Her complex and ambitious nature, as well as the politics of her downfall, are portrayed with great skill by Ms. Weir. Anne never bore Henry his longed for son, but she was the mother of Queen Elizabeth I, a truly great monarch.<br /><br />Poor Jane Seymour's mild manner was a temporary, but welcome, relief to Henry after his relationship with and marriage to Anne. However Queen Jane's narrative is brief, as was her life. She died after birthing Henry's only living son. Henry once said that he loved Jane Seymour best of all his wives, (she never really argued with him or expressed differing points of view), and he was buried by her side.<br /><br />Anne of Cleves, perhaps the most politically astute of Henry's wives, certainly the one with the best survival skills, was thrilled to be cast-off and allowed to keep her head.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the naive and beautiful Katherine Howard, Henry's \\"blushing rose without a thorn\\" went the way of Anne Boleyn, because of promiscuity, lack of savvy, and church politics.<br /><br />And Catherine Parr, a woman of extraordinary intellect, was one of only eight women whose writings were published during the reign of Henry and his father. She was fortunate to become aware of a plot against her before she met the same end as Queens Anne and Katherine.<br /><br />As a backdrop to these personal dramas and matters of state, the author draws a lavish portrait of court life with its moral and political intrigues. She details the struggle for international power, and clearly explains England's break with Rome and the beginning of the Protestant Reformation.<br /><br />This is a superb and very readable history, that has been meticulously researched.

From page one you will voyage with the most remarkably original cast of characters, through worlds of vibrant color, where the sun shines almost always - when not obscured by a four year downpour. You will find yourself laughing out loud when you are not sobbing in sympathy with someone dying of heartbreak. I do not like to label Sr. Garcia Marquez' work \\"magical realism.\\" There is no label to accurately describe the writing that gifted us with \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude.\\" This is a book that defies description. You must read it to experience the fantastically real world of Macondo, and the people who live there. Once you know them, they will be a part of your own world forever. Have you ever looked at a painting, walked into it and become a part of it? When you open this novel at page one, you are beckoned to enter.<br /><br />Macondo is a mythical South American town, founded, almost by accident, by Jose Arcadio Buendi­a, and populated primarily by his descendants. This is the story of one hundred years in the life of Macondo and its inhabitants - the story of the town's birth, development and death. Civil war and natural calamities plague this vital place whose populace fights to renew itself and survive. This is a huge narrative fiction that explores the history of a people caught up in the history of a place. And Marquez captures the range of human emotions and the reasons for experiencing them in this generational tale.<br /><br />There is much that is delightful and comical here. Surprises never cease, whether it be Remedios ascending, or a man whose presence is announced by clouds of butterflies. There is satire, sexuality and bawdiness galore. But there is also a pervading sadness and futility that permeates throughout. Cruelty is a reality in Marquez' world, as are failure, despair and senseless, sudden violence. The plot is filled with passion, poetry, romance, tragedy and the echoes of the history of Colombia and Latin America.<br /><br />I first read \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude\\" in 1968, while living in Latin America. I have read it 2 or 3 times over the years, always picking up new pieces of wonder that I had previously missed. This is my favorite novel, and I am an avid reader. My favorite fictional character is Melquiades, the gypsy who foretells the future of the township and whose ghost accompanies the reader until there is no more to read. Having read this in Spanish and English, I must laud Gregory Rabassa's extraordinary translation which faithfully brings to life not only Marquez' story, but his lyrical prose. This is one of the 20th Century's best works of fiction. It is a masterpiece not to be missed.<br /><br />JANAis a reality in Marquez' world, as are failure, despair and senseless, sudden violence.

It is also the story of the downfall of one woman, who attempts to live by her own rules, with no sponsor and no money of her own. Her parents are dead and she lives with relatives.<br /><br />The Barnes and Noble Classic Series Edition of  \\"The House of Mirth\\" contains an excellent Introduction by Jeffrey Meyers, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, who received his doctorate at Berkeley, and has worked as a professional writer since 1992. A distinguished biographer, Meyers has published 43 books and 520 articles on modern American, English, and European literature. This new edition also includes criticism, legacies, and study questions.

Though she has little money, she has family connections, good breeding and the hope of coming into an inheritance. Beautiful and very charming, Lily has been brought up to be an ornament, as were most women of her class at that time. She is a gilded bird with a noble heart, but clearly she is not aware of the restrictions of her cage. Part of Lily's tragedy is that she does have character, spirit, and a conscience. However, she does not know how to align these attributes, with her ornamental avocation, and her ambitions to marry a wealthy man of good birth.<br /><br />As expected, Lily is popular with both bachelors and married men. Most of the bachelors propose marriage at on time or another. The only man she has real affection for is her dear friend, Lawrence Seldon, a barrister, whose lack of income makes him entirely unsuitable as a husband. Lily had developed a gambling habit to support her lifestyle, and supplement her allowance. An unfortunate losing streak has put her into debt. In her naivete, she forms an unsavory business alliance with a married man. Later, she is unjustly accused of having an affair with him and their business arrangement also come to light.<br /><br />Her family cuts her off without a penny. Society friends and connections reject their former darling, trying to extricate themselves from any repercussions Lily's indiscreet behavior may have on their reputations. Former friends turn vicious. The irony is that Lily has never committed any of the sins she is accused of. Several of her friends have, and frequently...but their sins are committed with the utmost discretion. Lily's crime is indiscretion. Her beaus disappear, as do her marriage prospects. The hypocrisy of her class becomes more apparent to her, as she searches for a means to survive, with all the familiar doors closed in her face.<br /><br />Lily seeks employment as a seamstress in the New York City slums, and lives there also, in a humble room with no refinements. Having no formal training and no real ambition, (her ambivalence about work is obvious), she sinks into deep depression and begins to decline. Laudanum helps her to sleep, and she becomes dependent on the drug.<br /><br />Lily's descent, from society's beautiful darling to a disheveled, desperate woman living in a shabby hotel room, addicted to drugs, is disturbing reading, to say the least. Her decline seems inevitable, especially after we read of her many poor and self-destructive decisions. She seems to sabotage herself. However, Lily Bart is ultimately the victim of a cruel society that sacrifices anyone who does not conform to its expectations.<br /><br />After reading \\"House Of Mirth,\\" for the first time several years ago, Lily's character has remained clear in my mind.

A Must Read	Author Juan Rulfo's extraordinarily powerful novel, \\"Pedro Paramo,\\" captures the essence of life in rural Mexico during the last years of the 19th century, and the beginning of the 20th, like no other work of fiction. Here, in a mere 124 pages, the author vividly portrays the radical social and economic changes which spurred the dramatic migration of the campesinos from ranchos and villages to the urban slums, where they could no longer live off the land, nor find work. Ghost towns mark the places where many had once flourished. I first read this masterpiece in English while living in Guadalajara, Mexico, over 25 years ago. I was absolutely captivated by the haunting story and by the fascinating characters. I reread the book a few years later, in Spanish, and was able to appreciate, first-hand, the authors skillful, nuanced use of language. After a series of surrealistic dreams, which turned my thoughts southward, I recently picked up another copy and began to read once more of the dry, deserted streets of Comala and the man who doomed the town and its inhabitants. I am amazed that the novel remains as fresh, magical and poignant as it did the first time around. I think Juan Rulfo's masterpiece takes on depth and texture with each reading. And it certainly proves true the maxim, \\"Good/great things come in small packages.\\"<br /><br />Pedro Paramo, the son of failing landowners, was consumed with love for Susana San Juan. This intense passion lasted a lifetime. Eventually, Pedro's aging father and family died, and Susana moved away. Alone and lonely, he assumed control of the estate and unscrupulously did whatever he had to, fair and foul, to amass a fortune and build his empire. He married the heiress Dolores Preciado, took possession of her land and wealth, and sent her to live an isolated existence with her sister. His ranch, in Comala, the Media Luna, expanded with great success at the expense of others. However, the manipulative, exploitive patriarch would pay dearly, in spades in fact, for his greed and for the sorrow he brought to Comala and her people.<br /><br />Dolores Preciado, on her deathbed, extracts a promise from her son, Juan, to return to Comala to find his father and claim what is theirs. Juan narrates and guides the reader on his journey to the dusty, desolate village, now populated by ghosts, lost souls who murmur to him, sighing and complaining in desperate voices, until he believes that he too is dead. The story of Juan's experience, his search for identity and his heritage, is interwoven with the tale of his father, Pedro Paramo, and that of sad, beautiful Susana San Juan.<br /><br />The novel was first published in 1955 and has become a classic, not only in Spanish speaking countries, but worldwide, for its themes are universal. This is a literary class and a truly great book. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />JANAdearly, in spades in fact, for his greed and for the sorrow he brought to Comala and her people.  <br /> <br />Dolores Preciado, on her deathbed, extracts a promise from her son, Juan, to return to Comala to find his father and claim what is theirs.

Raymond is a doctoral candidate writing a dissertation on Robert Burton's \\"The Anatomy of Melancholy\\" at the University of Toronto. Hannah, another Toronto resident, is going to Jerusalem in six days to study Torah at an Orthodox egalitarian Institute. The two hook-up at a party. Neither expects more than a one-night stand. But the attraction between Hannah and Raymond is an intense one and continues far beyond one night. They are passionate together, physically, emotionally, intellectually. They laugh a lot. In short, they're falling in love and have an extremely brief period of time to do so. They are aware and stressed by the limitations of their situation.<br /><br />Raymond is an atheist. He expresses himself with irreverent humor, and eloquence, on Judaism, Christianity and Islam in a memorable passage, which I would quote here if it weren't so long. On the other hand, Hannah has trouble explaining her journey to Raymond, and to herself. \\"What it is is a program for North American almost-assimilated Jews like me, who are messed up about their Jewish identity and want to deal with it. And they tell you, this is what being a Jew is, and you are one. Oh, and here's how you do all the things that make you Jewish.\\"<br /><br />Their six days together take place in her sunlit attic apartment, bare now except for a bed, like an island in the middle of the room. They also spend some time at Raymond's place, a dark basement flat, and at a cottage on Enigma Lake, north of Toronto. Meals are shared at various ethnic restaurants, and in bed. They visit funky bars, drink wine, bourbon and crantinis, and explore each other's bodies, histories and minds. Can two people find true love in less than a week - a love which will endure nine months of separation - especially when one is a Jewish woman who is going to study religion in Jerusalem, and the other is an atheist \\"goy?\\" Or is this just a fling?<br /><br />Most of the novel takes place while the two are apart. Their communication, and some of the narrative, is conveyed through a series of emails between Israel and Canada. However, in between their correspondence, the book offers vivid and convincing glimpses of both characters' lives. Hannah's euphoria at her spiritual and cultural development comes across with enthusiasm. She wants Raymond to visit Jerusalem during the last month of her stay, to see the extraordinary city for himself, and to learn about Israel. Both of them want to find out whether their relationship is still viable. Raymond's melancholia contrasts sharply with Hannah's exuberance. He is bogged down with his writing. Toronto is always dark and cold in winter and he, unlike Hannah, is not making new friends. Their polarities and irreconcilable differences are brought to the fore, just as their connection and similarities were initially. Yet, the couple remains drawn to each other, in spite of the impediments of geographical distance, culture and newfound, (newly made), personal problems.<br /><br />Author Stephen Marche uses an interesting writing format for his novel. The margins act as a venue for a minimalist narrative which runs parallel to the main storyline. \\"Raymond considers Hannah's departure.\\" \\"Hannah considers homesickness, desperation and loneliness in the past tense.\\" \\"Hannah thinks about the name God.\\" \\"Raymond address the peoples of the Book.\\" It's a clever literary device that adds depth and wit to the novel. I wonder if Marche purposefully used the marginalia, because it so resembles Talmudic commentary.<br /><br />\\"Raymond and Hannah\\" (\\"A Love Story\\") is a most compelling read. It is hard to believe this is a debut novel. A quirky, original, bold, love story, it is certainly contemporary, combining physical lust, spiritual longing, and intellectual quests, as well as a search for emotional intimacy. The landscape of Israel, its contrasts and contradictions, where the elements of modern life meet history, is beautifully, realistically, and often ironically depicted.<br /><br />JANAand often ironically depicted. <br />JANA	2005-07-12

Pablo Neruda's \\"Memoirs\\" is not a comprehensive autobiographical document. It is a personal memoir, recounted as if the author was sitting around a table, with good friends and a bottle of excellent Chilean wine, telling tales of the people, anecdotes and incidents that were so important in his life. \\"Confieso Que He Vivido,\\" means I confess that I have lived. And Sr. Neruda certainly did that...with zest, zeal and so much talent. I have read both this Spanish edition and the English edition, translated by Hardie St. Martin, which is a good one, but it does not do justice to Neruda's beautiful skill with the Spanish language. He romances the language, like no other, even with his prose. I am only sorry I do not feel secure enough in my knowledge of Spanish grammar to write this review in the beloved language of Neruda.<br /><br />Neruda was born, the son of a railroad worker, in the then frontier wilderness of Southern Chile in 1904. He led a bohemian lifestyle, dressing in black \\"like the true poets of the last century,\\" during his university years in Santiago. His shyness, the \\"kink in the soul,\\"...especially of women, took him a while to overcome. He describes the people and places of that period with great 'carino' (love). His political ideology began to form at that time also, and politics became an integral part of his writing. The Student Federation, student demonstrations and the subsequent repression, had a great impact on the young intellectual.<br /><br />Neruda led a rich and fascinating life. World traveled throughout his life, he served as Chilean consul in Burma, Ceylon, and Java. He was the consul in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, and during this time \\"Nine Love Poems\\" from \\"Veinte Poemas de Amor y Una Cancion Desesperada\\" was published. It was at this time also, that his friend Federico Garcia Lorca was killed. Neruda was present in Paris to organize a worldwide anti-Facist congress of writers that would be held in Madrid. His writing about Spain during the war is heartbreaking. Returning to Chile in 1938, he found a burgeoning Fascist movement in his own beloved land.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed his account of the time he spent in Mexico, as consul. He tells of his encounters with the great Mexican painters there.<br /><br />After returning home, Neruda ran for political office and was elected to Chile's Senate in 1945. He was later removed from his Senate seat after joining the Communist Party.<br /><br />His friends included: Garcia Lorca, Ehrenburg, Picasso, Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, Octavio Paz, Miguel Angel Asturias, Gandhi, Nehru, Mao, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and most sadly, Salvador Allende.<br /><br />Pablo Neruda's death, just weeks after the brutal murder of Chile's President Allende, is something I will never forget. I was living in Colombia at that time, and remember where I was and what I was doing when I learned of Allende's death, and later heard of Neruda's passing. It called to mind, then and now, my recollections, as a young girl, when President Kennedy's assassination was announced. I always thought Neruda died of a broken heart.<br /><br />This is an exceptionally good memoir, told with great charm, in a series of vignettes. I highly recommend it, especially to anyone who has read and enjoyed Pablo Neruda's poetry - to my mind some of the most beautiful in the world. It also gives us a glimpse of the politics of the left from the point of view of a Latin American - not the usual perspective, and well worth while.<br />JANAar is heartbreaking.

There is also a brief biography of George Eliot included.<br /><br />Ms. Eliot created here, an entire community in England in the mid-1800s and called it Middlemarch. She populated this provincial town with people of every station, local squires and their families, tradespeople, the rising middle class, (Middlemarch, right?), & the poor and destitute, ruthless and honest. She crowded them together, with all their ambitions, dreams and foibles, in this magnificent literary soap opera, and wove a wonderful web of plots and subplots. Ms. Eliot also wrote scathing social commentary and used great wit.<br /><br />The fortunes of Middlemarch are rising in this new era when machines and trains - fast, available transportation - are changing the world, the economy, the politics. Rigid social codes, the British class system, is in danger of being breached. Folks are out to make a quick buck, or a shilling - anything to acquire wealth and enhance social position.<br /><br />Dorothea Brooks lives in Middlemarch. She is an intelligent, sensitive young woman, who wants to dedicate her life to important endeavors. She does not want to settle for a typical marriage and family, but looks toward a more noble cause. As a woman, a professional life is not open to her, nor is the pursuit of intellect, outside of marriage. She weds the elderly Rev.

Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \\"up\\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption.

There are consequences, always.<br /><br />Gillian Beer writes a fascinating Introduction in this Penguin Classic Edition, in which she discusses Miss Austen's portrayal of the double-edged nature of persuasion. This complete and unabridged edition also contains a biography of the author, an Afterword, a new chronology and full textual notes.<br /><br />Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \\"break the connection,\\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl or a viscount.<br /><br />The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is sooo palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). I think this is Ms. Austen at her most passionate. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.<br /><br />This remarkable novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen.<br /><br />JANAtackles, is just as germane today as it was when written.

On a hot July afternoon, two eleven year-old girls are sent home early from a birthday party. One of them, Ronnie, (Veronica Fuller), has been acting out inappropriately - her usual rebellious behavior - thus the banishment. Ronnie is prone to dark moods. Her companion, Alice, (Alice Manning), a shy, chubby girl who is innocent of any misbehavior, has to leave also, so her friend won't have to walk home alone. Actually, Alice doesn't really consider Ronnie a friend. Her mother, Helen, insists that Alice play with Ronnie, at least in the summertime, when Alice's schoolmates from St. William of York are at camp. Helen Manning, a single mom, doesn't have enough money to send Alice away for the summer months, or to continue with her private schooling after grade school. So Alice thinks of Ronnie as a \\"summertime-only friend,\\" and a fellow \\"doesn't-have-a-pool-membership girl.\\" Alice is a good girl, she believes, along with almost everyone else. She is very bright, although not anywhere near as creative or as artistic as her mother, which worries her. She so wants to please. Ronnie, on the other hand, comes from a very dysfunctional, working-class family, who scream a lot and steal from each other, and \\"the parents don't care what their kids watch on TV.\\"<br /><br />On the way home that July day, Ronnie decides she wants to take a shortcut through a really nice neighborhood, where the houses are fancier and the lawns more spacious. Ronnie spots a baby carriage on the porch of the biggest, prettiest house on the street. The two girls decide that the baby has been left carelessly in the sun and heat too long. The carriage is also too close to the steps and there could be an accident. So they decide to take the baby, to care for her better than her parents are doing.<br /><br />Four days later, the baby's dead body is found by rookie cop, Nancy Porter, in a hut in Baltimore's Leakin Park. The child had been suffocated. Both girls are arrested. Although no clear account of the story emerges, they do admit to taking the baby. Ronnie and Alice are convicted and sentenced to spend the next seven years, until their eighteenth birthdays, in separate juvenile detention facilities, one a somewhat harsher institution than the other.<br /><br />When the two are released, young adults now, they are advised to avoid each other. Each one has the possibility to make a new start in life, find a job, go to community college. The only bonds which remain between Alice and Ronnie are the secrets they hold close, and their bewildered reentry into a world where they have no past. As juveniles, their names were never released to the public.<br /><br />Within a brief period after the girls gain their freedom, several small children begin to disappear from public places, only to be found again relatively quickly, and always on the premises where they were \\"lost.\\" Then another toddler disappears, and this one is not found. The circumstances are chillingly similar to the abduction case seven years before. Now Alice's and Ronnie's parents, their lawyers, and the police, must discover and confront the shattering truths they did not push hard enough to find out years earlier. Otherwise, another family will lose their child.<br /><br />This is a disturbing, unsettling novel with a stunning conclusion. The author's premise is that, perhaps, the most shocking crimes are committed by children. Or is the public more shocked that children are capable of commiting murder? Do eleven year-olds really understand what they are doing when they take a life? At what age do we prosecute children as adults for heinous crimes they commit? Ms. Lippman appears to believe that children are just as capable of calculation, premeditation and manipulation as anyone else. The reader is left to make his/her own decision.<br /><br />All the characters in \\"Every Secret Thing\\" share some major commonalities. Adults and children alike, all long for acceptance by their peers. Don't we all? They all have secrets and all of them share serious emotional pain. I do think that apart from Ronnie, Alice and Helen Manning, (who is a complex woman and well portrayed), the characters are rather one-dimensional. Sharon Kerpelman was Alice's original lawyer, and is filled with guilt that she didn't work out a better deal for her client. She has stayed in touch with Alice during her detention period, and wants to act as a mentor now that the girl is free. Alice doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Baltimore homicide Detective Nancy Porter feels she has to prove she earned her rapid rise in the department. That her swift move from rookie to county detective was not because of her fluke find years before, nor because of family nepotism. Cynthia Barnes, the mother of the murdered child, is still grief-stricken, and her pain and guilt take the form of obsession for revenge. The character of reporter Mira Jenkins is totally flat. I don't really understand her place in the book, or the author's attempt to develop her. She obviously represents the presence of the press - but her part could have been played anonymously and the narrative honed. As is, many extraneous personages are introduced needlessly. I don't find any of the characters particularly likeable - but that's not a necessary component to enjoy this book. Also, I find it odd that there are basically no male characters, just the detectives who pretty much remain in the background.<br /><br />\\"Every Secret thing\\" is much more than a mystery or a suspense thriller. It is a study of the two girls and the tragedy they cause. The novel also deals with issues of race, class, the burden of peer pressure,  the larger issue of children who commit crimes and when they should be tried as adults, and SECRETS. As usual, the author's writing is taut and her story a page-turner.<br /><br />JANAs. Don't we all? They all have secrets and all of them share serious emotional pain.

It fills her with anguish to think that she, at age four, had a hand in the accidental shooting death of Deborah Fontanel Owens, her own mother. Lily's life has been shaped around this incident, and she has never ceased to yearn for her mother, (for a mother's love), although her memories of the actual woman have been blurred by time. In fact, Lily has very little memory of that dark day's events, and is totally dependent on her miserable, sadistic father, T. Ray Owens, for any and all accounts of her mom. The only person who shows her any affection is Rosaleen, a black peach-picker T. Ray brought in from the fields to care for his child.<br /><br />At fourteen, Lily is extremely bright, loves to read and has a talent for writing. One of her teachers has encouraged her to think about a college education, although her father tells her she will be lucky to go to beauty school. On July 4, 1964, Lily's birthday, she walks Rosaleen to town so the black woman can register to vote. President Lyndon B. Johnson just signed into effect the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and Rosaleen feels pride in doing her civic duty, as does Lily in accompanying her. The two are harassed by three white men, one of whom is the biggest racist in town. When Rosaleen tries to defend herself, she and Lily are thrown in jail. In reality, back then in the American South, given what Rosaleen did to defend herself, and to whom she did it, she very well could have been beaten to death on the spot. T. Ray picks up his daughter almost immediately, and painfully punishes the girl. She manages to escape, though, and to break Rosaleen out of the hospital where she is recovering from her afternoon's encounter with Jim Crowe.<br /><br />One of the few mementoes Lily has of her mother is a small picture of a black Madonna with the words, Tiburon, S. C. on the back. Lily has saved some money from selling peaches at her father's roadside stand, and is certain that if she and Rosaleen can reach Tiburon, she will find out about her Momma, and they will somehow be safe. And, sure enough, in Tiburon, S. C. Lily  finds a connection between her Madonna picture and a trio of fairy godmother-like women -  the calendar sisters May, June, and August Boatwright. These black spinster sisters live in a Pepto-Bismol pink-colored house, on a large tract of land outside of town. They keep bees, sell honey and other bee by-products, and their label, the Black Madonna Honey Company, is the same as the picture keepsake that Lily has from her mother. It is here that Lily learns, among many things, that \\"without a queen, the hive will die.\\" She understands that she must replace her own queen, her dead mother, or she will shrivel-up inside.<br /><br />August Boatwright, Mother Figure, (with capital letters!), earth mother, and Madonna all-in-one, takes Lily and Rosaleen in without question, gives them jobs and a home - at least temporarily, until they can live and grow in an environment which will allow them to thrive. And along the way Lily will learn some basic truths, common for both bees and people.<br /><br />All kinds of neat tidbits and facts about bees, their lives, habits, care, beekeeping in general, and honey production are woven throughout the book, and the details are fascinating. Each chapter is headed with a quotation about bees. However, as important and interesting as bees are as themes in \\"The Secret Life Of Bees,\\" sometimes the narrative is too sweet and sugary for my taste.<br /><br />Sue Monk Kidd writes beautifully, lyrically, about a southern white girl's unusual coming of age. However, the novel reads, frequently, like fantasy fiction. Now, I enjoy a beautiful story, especially when the author is as talented as this one, but I grew up in the 1950's and 60's, and the history I recollect is far different from this book's version. I clearly remember what the times were like when President Johnsonsigned the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and when Schwerner, Cheney & Goodman were murdered in Mississippi, and when Ms. Fanny Lou Hamer challenged white domination of the Mississippi Democratic Party. I was at the Democratic Convention in 1964 in Atlantic City, as a student delegate, when Ms. Hamer and her colleagues entered Convention Hall. Sue Monk Kidd's bucolic Sylvan, South Carolina, and the little town of Tiburon, are poetic, magical places - in spite of rampant racism. One character is badly beaten, but not killed - she is actually able to walk out of the hospital within 24 hours. Another is unjustly jailed, but set free after a day or so - and not harmed? A strange white girl just moves in with a family of black women, in rural SC, and no one makes a helluva hullabaloo? And I shudder to think of a white teenage girl driving around in a car, in the front seat, with a black teenage male - in 1964 South Carolina. This would not be believable in many northern cities at the time - but it was unthinkable in the south. That poor guy would have never made it to the jailhouse alive!!<br /><br />So let me stop here and say, that while I enjoyed reading this book, with its rich narrative and characters, it does read like a fairy tale. The hideous racism and violence of life in the US, north and south, is not depicted realistically in comparison to the beautiful, pastoral setting and peace of life with the Boatwright women. I do hope readers realize that much poetic licence has been taken here in terms of what this difficult period was like in US history.<br /><br />It's interesting to note, I think, that Lily's ideal home, almost heaven, is depicted as being among black women. There used to be many white children, in the south, (and in the north), during the 1960's and before, who received a primary source of love and care from black women, hired to work for their families. I am sure this warm, loving fantasy is not uncommon.<br />JANAand when Schwerner, Cheney & Goodman were murdered in Mississippi, and when Ms. Fanny Lou Hamer challenged white domination of the Mississippi Democratic Party.

Sirine is the superb chef at Nadia's Cafe, a Lebanese restaurant in a small Near Eastern community in Los Angeles, near UCLA. The menu proclaims \\"Real True Arab Food,\\" and the ethnic cuisine, scented with exotic spices and tasting of home, comforts and inspires the Arab and Iranian expatriates who eat here and live, work and study nearby. The food is actually so delicious that non-Middle Easterners frequent the restaurant also.<br /><br />Sirine is a lovely, intelligent woman, who could have married at many points in her life. However, at age thirty-nine she is still single and not looking to change her civil status. Her father was Iraqi, her mother American. Together they worked for the Red Cross, and together they died in Africa when Sirene was just nine years-old. Her beloved Iraqi uncle, her father's brother, has cared for her ever since. Although she doesn't speak Arabic, is not a Muslim - nor a member of any religion for that matter, and has never been outside the US, she feels connected to Iraq and curious about her cultural and ethnic identity. Her few memories of her parents are painful. They always seemed to be saying good-by to her, or returning as strangers. When they failed to return that last time, she closed her heart against further loss.<br /><br />Life is good, though. Sirine is independent and works at a job she loves. Her uncle, who provides his niece with enough love to equal a large family's worth, is also a professor and a teller of tales and fables which would put Shaharazad to shame. His \\"moralless\\" story, \\"the story of how to love,\\" runs parallel to the actual narrative. It is about Aunt Camille and son, Abdelrahman Salahadin, who had an \\"incurable addiction to selling himself as a slave and faking his own drowning.\\" Sirene has a coterie of good friends, including: King Babar, the dog, cafe owner, Um-Nadia,  Mireille, Nadia's daughter, Nathan, a brilliant but reclusive photographer - who has spent a good deal of time in Iraq, Aziz Abdo, a Syrian poet, (and somewhat smarmy), and the homesick cafe regulars who believe Sirine is a God send. Um-Nadia understands the loneliness of the immigrants. She says, \\"The loneliness of the Arab is a terrible thing; it is all-consuming....it threatens to swallow him whole when he leaves his own country, even though he marries and travels and talks to friends twenty-four hours a day.\\"<br /><br />When Sirine is sought out by exiled Iraqi Arabic literature professor Hanif Al Eyad, she is unable to deny the strong emotional and physical attraction she feels. Although they are well into adulthood, they both experience the wonder, confusion, excitement and passion of first love. He even helps her prepare baklava! Han, as the professor is called, went into exile as a young boy, when Saddam Hussein came into power. He was much too immature at the time to understand the enormity of his decision, and the repercussions if he should want to return to his homeland. He hasn't seen his brother, sister or parents in over twenty years. He had no idea when he left how much he would miss them and his country. He longs for his people - the sights, smells, food, of his native land. With Sirine, Han does not feel like an exile. \\"You are the place I want to be - you're the opposite of exile.\\" Yet Han's past remains a mystery. Why did he leave Iraq at so young an age? Why does he put-off answering Sirine's questions, telling her he will eventually give her answers, and not doing so?<br /><br />The pain of exile, and loss, are themes which run through the storyline of this beautiful novel. Sirine's Iraqi uncle asks an Italian waiter in a Los Angeles restaurant, \\"Wouldn't you say that immigrants are sadder than other people?\\" To which the waiter responds, \\"Certo! When we leave our home we fall in love with our sadness.\\" The uncle explains to Sirine why he doesn't like talking about his former home, back in Iraq - the home he shared with Sirine's father and their parents. \\"It means talking about the differences between then and now, and that's often a sad thing. And immigrants are always a bit sad right from the start anyway..... but the big thing is that you can't go back. For example, the Iraq your father and I came from doesn't exist anymore. It's a new scary place. When your old house doesn't exist anymore, that makes things sadder in general.\\"<br /><br />Another major theme is the importance of keeping one's native culture and traditions alive through food, memory, language, and storytelling/legends. For this reason, food and its preparation are so important in \\"Crescent.\\" Sirine is an American but she learned to cook the foods of the Middle East from both her mother and father. Her favorite memory of them is watching them both make baklava. They moved together like in a dance. And then they taught her to take her part in the preparation of this dessert.<br /><br />And, of course, love and intimacy are important ingredients here also.<br /><br />Author Diana Abu-Jabar's prose is lush and lyrical. It awakens the senses, evoking exotic imagery, sounds, tastes, smells - even textures. For political and cultural reasons, this is a good book for Americans to read. We all know what an evil person Saddam Hussein is. However, the novel gives a realistic idea of how the Iraqis suffered under the Post Gulf War embargo, and continue to suffer in the current situation - without blaming any one person, government or country. The rich Iraqi culture is also discussed, which many of us are not as informed about as we should be. I don't think there is a part of this novel that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. Although nothing is perfect, I am still too immersed in the whole gestalt of \\"Crescent\\" to come up with any flaws at the moment. And isn't that the best feeling to be left with when finishing a book? Highly recommended!<br /><br />Ms. Abu-Jabar lives in Florida and teaches at the University of Miami.

Friedrich Barbarossa, crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1155, attempted to establish the German states as preeminent in Europe. He fought in ongoing wars with northern Italy, seizing and sacking Milan as a warning to all who would stand in his path. Barbarossa awarded precious holy relics from Milan to the Archbishop of Cologne, Rainald von Dassel, for his aid and chancellorship. Many Italians obviously did not want these relics taken to Germany. \\"Map of Bones\\" opens with a flashback to 1162. A small group of monks, the Archbishop's men, are leading a wagon with the priceless cargo to the German border. They are attacked near their destination. However, both sides in this endeavor are mysteriously thwarted.<br /><br />Cut to present day Cologne. A special midnight mass is being conducted in the city's massive gothic cathedral, the K&ouml;lner Dom, by the present day archbishop. It is the occasion of the Feast of the Three Kings. The beautiful church is known for its extraordinary architecture, art, stained glass windows, and, above all, the magnificent gilded Sarcophagus of the Magi, the largest reliquary in the western world. Brought there over 850 years before by Archbishop Rainald von Dassel, it is thought to hold the remains of the Three Wise Men who brought gifts to the Christ child. Immediately after parishioners receive Holy Communion, a band of armed intruders, disguised as monks, unleash a nightmare of terror, ruthlessly killing virtually everyone present. They then steal the ancient bones, leaving the golden sarcophagus and other treasures untouched.<br /><br />The Vatican requests that the US government dispatch a covert Sigma Force team to assist local investigators in finding out who committed this heinous massacre and why. DARPA, the Department of Defense's research and development wing which oversees Sigma Force, complies. Dr./Commander Grayson Pierce is selected as group leader. Lieutenant Rachel Verona, of Rome's carabinieri, is assigned to work with the elite squad. And her uncle Vigor, a Catholic priest and a spy for the Pope and other Vatican good guys, tags along. By the way - the entire Sigma team have advanced degrees in science and/or engineering, (no Liberal Arts humanities types here), genius IQs, and mega-combat skills. They are also extremely attractive. Lt. Verona, also quite lovely, has similar training - hmmm, a cop with elite Navy SEAL skills. And her uncle's no slouch either!<br /><br />According to the \\"Map of Bones\\" storyline, the Dragon Court, a secret fraternity of alchemists and assassins, formed in medieval times, still exists today, if only to serve as our villains. These men, responsible for the theft and the murders, (and much more!), have definite plans for the sacred remains - which are not human bones. They will stop at nothing less than world domination. Interestingly, the actual historic Order of the Dragon was an occult-inspired secret society created by the aristocracies of medieval Europe following the formation of chivalric orders like the Knights Templar. Vlad the Impaler, better known as Vlad Tepes, (or to fans of Bram Stoker, as Dracula), was a member of the Order of the Dragon. (sorry for the tangential remark). There are also evil Vatican spies and a member of a sinister Guild who work with the Dragons.<br /><br />Author James Rollins' packs mythology, religion, ancient relics, history, (including Vatican history), cutting-edge science and technology, the ancient wonders of the world, manna from the desert, puzzles, clues, and enough action for three novels into this one. As always, Rollins does his research. However, I was really disappointed in the story. There is altogether too much fleeing, chasing and fighting, and not enough uninterrupted plot. Every time I would get into the mystery, or an aspect of mythology or history, along would come the same old bad guys to cause more bloodshed and tumult, (the good guys always make it out with just a few band-aids). After a whilethese sequences lose all credibility and tension. There is little fluidity to the narrative - it is really jarring at times! I don't expect any real character development in this kind of novel. I am a big fan of James Rollins, loved \\"Sandstorm,\\" but one doesn't expect depth of character in an action adventure thriller. However, this time the personages were extremely shallow, except for Grayson Pierce. And Lt. Verona's eye-batting is ridiculous. What can I say? My adrenaline did not flow with \\"Map of Bones,\\" nor did my heart beat faster. It's an entertaining read that is not hard to put down.<br /><br />JANAa while these sequences lose all credibility and tension.

The level of suspense in Edgar Award-winning Michael Connelly's riveting whodunit, \\"The Poet,\\" is so intense that even though I read the thriller's sequel, \\"The Narrows,\\" first and therefore knew some of the more important aspects of the plot, including the identity of the serial murderer, I was still caught off guard and surprised throughout the novel. I do suggest, however, that one read the books in order for maximum enjoyment - although both are easily 5 Star reads.<br /><br />The opening lines, from the mouth, (or mind), of protagonist Jack McEvoy, are knock-outs.

Author Connelly was a crime reporter himself, and his obvious expertise when describing the investigation, along with his knowledge of police procedures and the newspaper business, lends enormous credibility to his narrative.<br /><br />When Jack is informed of the suicide of his twin brother, Sean, a homicide detective who was obsessed with a particularly heinous murder case, he has serious doubts that his brother was capable of taking his own life. Jack breaks his own rule. How can he keep his twin's death at arm's length? He begins to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death on his own, and discovers that Sean was murdered - a murder ingeniously disguised as a suicide. His research also brings to light several similar \\"apparent\\" suicides by homicide detectives, in various US cities. All of the dead cops were deeply disturbed by exceptionally grisly cases they were working on. Also common to all the deaths are brief and cryptic suicide notes, quoting lines  from some of the more obscure writings of Edgar Allen Poe. Cases in Chicago, Baltimore, Dallas, New Mexico and Florida are eventually reopened. Jack continues to follow his leads, and to protect his sources, until the FBI discovers what he has uncovered and puts an end to his detecting. Obviously, they want to take over - these are federal crimes, after all, and Jack is a journalist. McEvoy threatens to print the story, which is his right - but would give the killer a heads-up. However an agreement is struck that Jack will temporarily sit on the scoop if the feds allow him to sit-in on the case. Thus, an unlikely team is forged. Several members of the FBI's Behavioral Science Section, and one Denver reporter, race against the clock to track the killer(s) and prevent the next murder(s).<br /><br />This is one scary, chilling thriller. Add Poe's writing to this unnerving mix, and I'd advise you to read during daylight hours, or keep all the lights on in the evening. If you are squeamish, this may not be the book for you, as it deals with mutilation, child molestation and pedophilia.<br /><br />Connelly is an excellent writer and his characters are every bit as compelling, complex and convincing as his narrative. The psychological aspects behind the motivations of many of these personages are just plain fascinating. To me Thomas Harris' \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Red Dragon\\" are the best books I have every read in this particular category/genre. I have yet to read anything which induces the terror evoked by these two novels. This one comes close.<br /><br />JANAe notes, quoting lines  from some of the more obscure writings of Edgar Allen Poe.

Forty years before \\"Dead Witch Walking\\" begins, a quarter of mankind died from the mutated virus named T4 Angel. According to Kim Harrison's alternate world history, US and USSR Cold War zeal spurred Bigtime investment into bio-engineered weapons, as well as drugs, (even more so than in our actual world. Imagine that!!). This intensity of purpose \\"turned science inward instead of outward. We never made it to the moon.\\" A lethal DNA chain spread from a lab and attached itself to a bio-engineered tomato. The product was a deadly fruit, indeed. The rest is history - as was a quarter of humanity. This is when homo sapiens discovered they were/are not the only human-like creatures, (sort of), on the planet. The Inderland species, witches, lycanthropes, the undead, (vampires), trolls, pixies, faeries, etc., were resistant to T4 Angel. And so there came a time, when the virus died-out, and it was discovered that the combined numbers of Inderland species on earth equaled, and occasionally surpassed, the total number of human beings. The \\"Turn\\" is the name for the moment when humans discovered they shared the planet with \\"others.\\" Their reaction to the Turn, and events leading up to it, was to outlaw medical research. No more new meds or biotechnology. Imagine the stock markets!! The Washington lobbyists!!<br /><br />So, to cut to the chase - The Federal Inderland Bureau, (FIB), a purely human institution, was created, to monitor Inderlander activities. A rival force made-up of out-of-work federal agents and Inderlander police was then formed, and called Inderland Security (IS). Their only common goal was to search and destroy any remaining bio labs and illegal substances.<br /><br />Our protagonist, Rachel Morgan, a red-headed witch, is a top contract runner for the IS with an excellent employment record, until recently. Known for always bringing-in the bad guys, with or without the use of magic, she has been experiencing a run of bad luck lately. Tired of shabby treatment from her boss, (who she finds out has been sabotaging her), along with lousy assignments, she breaks her contract and quits the IS. Her friends Ivy, a living vampire, and Jenks, a prolific pixie, leave along with her in a show of solidarity. The three decide to team-up and freelance. The last runner who quit was, unfortunately, blown to bits. IS is what is known as a cradle to grave kind of company, and resignations are frowned upon - severely! Ivy pays off her IS contract, so she has nothing to worry about. Jenks was always a freelancer. Rachael, however, is blamed for being a negative influence on the two, and her boss, Denon, is determined to terminate her life in a quick and gory fashion. He never liked her anyway. Now Rachael is a \\"dead witch walking.\\"<br /><br />In between dodging assassination attempts, Rachel is determined to bring down one of the city's, (a very much altered Cincinnati), most powerful men, a drug kingpin who has been running Brimstone and biodrugs. She believes if she can bring in this crime boss, the IS might rescind the contract they have taken out on her life.<br /><br />While I really enjoyed Ms. Harrison's alternate world, and her creative society building along with the interaction between various species of Inderlanders, there is really not much of a plot here. There's lots of structure, but little meat on the bones. I found the narrative to be choppy more often than not, although the pace is fast and there's lots of humor. I just couldn't find much to sink my teeth into. I think the author plans \\"Dead Witch Walking\\" to be the first book in a series. If so, it has definite possibilities and I would consider reading a second book, which hopefully will be more plot driven, and not as \\"cute\\" as this one.<br />JANAwho she finds out has been sabotaging her), along with lousy assignments, she breaks her contract and quits the IS.

Set in post Civil War Spain, the author accurately paints a grim portrait of a country settling into the \\"normality\\" of an uneasy peace. Atrocities have devastated both sides of the conflict. The populace's \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\" attitude will continue for many years, and even in 1941, battle scars are still fresh, as are memories of dead loved ones, and festering political wounds. Many areas of Spain are in ruins, and food shortages leave much of the population hungry - some are literally starving The descriptions of the humiliation, defeat and isolation of those who did not support Franco's cause is made palpable throughout Ms. Pawel's intelligent narrative. However, while Spain strives toward peace, law and order, the rest of the world is in the throes of WWII.<br /><br />Carlos Tejada is one of the most well developed characters that I have met in recent popular fiction, as is his new wife Elena. They are both extremely bright, well educated, decent people, and polar opposites politically. He is the second son of a wealthy landowner, a conservative, and a staunch Nationalist. He backed Franco from the beginning. Now, as a lieutenant in the Guardia Civil, Tejada's Falangist views have been moderated somewhat through maturity, experience, and the influence of his spouse - the former Elena Fernandez, Socialist daughter of a distinguished Classics professor at the University of Salamanca. Carlos studied law at this university before joining the Guardia during the war. The couple met in Madrid, where she worked as a schoolteacher, while Tejada was investigating a murder. When Elena was dismissed from her position because of her leftist politics, she returned to her family's home in Salamanca, where Tejada had been transferred and promoted to the position of  lieutenant. The two eventually marry here, after weathering some major adventures and solving a few mysteries.<br /><br />Lt. Tejada is extremely pleased to accept a promotion and his first command with yet another transfer, this time to the Cantabrian village of Potes, a remote outpost in the Picos de Europa Mountains of northern Spain. He sees this relocation as an opportunity to lead his own men, and to get away from his difficult former commander. Tension had also developed between himself and some of his fellow officers when they realized he was marrying into a \\"red\\" family. Elena is now pregnant and not as content with the new post as her husband. After all, the area is extremely isolated and this is her first pregnancy.<br /><br />The Tejadas arrive in the middle of a blizzard and there is no one to meet them. The officers at the small post are not exactly welcoming, nor were they expecting a woman - certainly not a pregnant woman with leftist leanings, (all documented in her file). Since there are no adequate quarters for a married couple, the two find lodgings at a local fonda. Tejada takes command of the small force, which appears to be sorely lacking in discipline. He also discovers that the former Guardia commander was killed by the maquis, the Republican guerillas, who still operate in the pine forests and periodically shoot at the patrols. Although the war has been over for almost two years, the small town is a center of smuggling and guerrilla activities. Sergeant M&aacute;rquez, Tejada's immediate subordinate, is a man of questionable judgement, and the other officers, although good at following orders, are limited.<br /><br />Within days of the Tejada's arrival, it is discovered that two shipments of dynamite have been stolen from Devastated Regions, a government agency responsible for rebuilding what the war destroyed. In the Devra Valley almost everything was destroyed. Carlos is beside himself. If the maquis have taken the dynamite, then every bridge and building in the area are in danger. Events really seem out of control when the corpse of a local man is found by the river. Unfortunately, Elena discovers the body.<br /><br />Elena has become caught up in the problems of the town's inhabitants, who shun the Guardia...and her. She is obviously lonely, and her politics and friendly nature make her extremely sympathetic to the locals and their various plights. She discusses opening a school with the area's priest and, perhaps, teaching there.<br /><br />This rich historical novel is much more than a mystery, although the sleuth-work and suspense are riveting. The characters themselves are the story - and a most compelling one. Obviously Carlos and Elena go through an adjustment period, as do all newlyweds. However, it is rare that a Falangist Guardia Civil officer and a Socialist, university educated woman, choose to make their lives together - at least not in the early 1940s in Franco's Spain. Their commitment to each other, however, to form a good life together, in spite of their differences, seems to me to symbolize the future hope of Spain. The supporting cast and sub-plots are also extremely compelling. Ms. Pawel spent more than a month in Potes, researching her novel. Highly recommended!<br /><br />JANAt of control when the corpse of a local man is found by the river.

Carlos Tejada Alonso y L&eacute;on, who was introduced to readers in Rebecca Pawel's Edgar Award-winning novel \\"Death of A Nationalist,\\" has recently been promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the Guardia Civil and transferred from Madrid to Salamanca, a city famous for its university. Tejada studied law here before joining the Guardia during the Civil War. He is just past thirty years-old - certainly very young to be a lieutenant. However, Tejada's entire profile is unusual for a National Guardsman. He is the second son of a wealthy landowner, a conservative, and a staunch Nationalist. A Falangist, he backed Franco from the beginning. Now he enforces the laws and policies of the Generalissimo's authoritarian government, and searches for \\"enemies of the state,\\" usually Republicans, who are jailed, sometimes tortured, and frequently killed. Tejada is basically a decent man, a hero of the siege of Toledo - and while I am certainly not an apologist for Fascism, (on the contrary), there must have been some good people who fought and believed in the Nationalist cause, even if they were on the wrong side of history.<br /><br />I wrote in my review of \\"Death of a Nationalist,\\" that author Rebecca C. Pawel presents the reader with a very interesting dilemma. How does one empathize with a protagonist who is a member of the Fascist cause, one of the victors in Spain's bitter, bloody Civil War? How does one embrace, in a literary fashion, someone who works to enforce Fascist policies? This continues to be an issue in \\"Law of Return,\\" although personally, I resolved my problems with Tejada in the last book. I find too many admirable qualities in him to pass over because of his politics - which I am definitely not in agreement with. I accept him for the man he is, and for the man he has the potential to become.<br /><br />It is 1940, and although the Civil War has been over for a year, fear, paranoia, hunger and shortages are everywhere. One of Tejada's new responsibilities in Salamanca is overseeing local parolees who must report to him weekly. There are approximately seventy-five, and many are considered troublemakers because of their Socialist leanings and/or former affiliations. Of particular interest are a group of four, all former university professors called \\"the petitioners.\\"<br /><br />These men are labeled \\"petitioners\\" because of a historical incident which occurred on October 12, 1936, at a public ceremony at the University of Salamanca commemorating Dia de la Raza. Keynote speaker, Falangist General Millan de Astray finished his address with the slogan, \\"Viva la Muerte!\\" (\\"Long Live Death!\\"). Miguel de Unamuno, a great Spanish author, educator, humanist and philosopher, was standing next to the general on the platform. He said, \\"Vencera pero no convencera.\\"). (\\"You will win but you will not convince\\"). Enraged, Millan had to be physically restrained from striking Unamuno, who was  immediately removed from his position at the university and placed under house arrest. He died two months later. Ironically, Unamuno was a devout Catholic and accepted by the Falangists. He had misinterpreted Franco's cause, however, thinking it represented nationalism. Manuel Arroyo, Guillermo Fernandez , Tomas Rivera, and Arturo Velasquez are fictional characters who, as professors, circulated and signed a petition protesting the treatment of their colleague.<br /><br />There are times when I so dislike our protagonist, even though I understand his reasoning. This is due to the author's extraordinary talent in developing complex, true-to-life characters. She is also on-target when portraying the political conflict of the period. Tejada, when interviewing Dr. Rivera, thinks, \\"You were a damn fool to meddle in what didn't concern you.\\" (Because Rivera signed the petition knowing there would probably be retribution). Yet one knows, from reading about him, that Tejada would never just obey orders or keep silent when faced with what he believed to be injustice. Carlos Tejado is  an anti-hero, struggling with his personal political beliefs, his firmly entrenched dedication to justice and the law, and the grim post-war situation he finds himself in. He begins to understand that in the tonal scale of life, the differences between right and wrong are more subtle and variegated than black and white.<br /><br />When one of the petitioners disappears, Tejado's investigation takes him to the seaside resort of San Sebastian, and then on to Nazi occupied France. On this trip he comes into contact, once again, with the lovely schoolteacher he met in Madrid, Elena Fernandez. She had been dismissed from her job because of her leftist politics, and returned home to Salamanca to be with her parents. However, this is not Tejada's first post-Madrid encounter with Elena. Her father is Guillermo Fernandez, a distinguished Classics professor. He is also one of the \\"petitioners\\" and a parolee. When Elena accompanied him to one of the weekly meetings, she and Tejada saw each other. The growing relationship between these two greatly enriches the narrative. Their mutual attraction, affection and respect, along with their opposing political viewpoints, makes for a good match and an interesting read. Both Elena and Carlos are extremely bright and literate people which provides a strong base of commonality. It helps that she is clever at figuring out mysteries too.<br /><br />There is an important and moving side story here. Professor Joseph Meyer, a German-Jewish friend and colleague of Professor Fernandez, writes begging for help to cross into Spain from France before he is forcibly repatriated to Germany and sent to a concentration camp. The Fernandez family's humanity, as individuals and as a unit, is emphasized here considering the risk they are willing to take for an outsider.<br /><br />\\"Law of Return\\" is just plain fascinating. Its originality is refreshing and the taut, well written prose is far different from what is found in many formulaic crime novels on today's market. This is much more than a mystery, however. It is historical fiction at its best. Ms. Pawel paints a vivid portrait of post-war Spain, whose people are trying to come to grips with past horrors and return to some semblance of normalcy. The author's descriptions of the humiliation, defeat and isolation of those who did not support Franco's cause is palpable.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Law of Return,\\" and suggest reading \\"Death of a Nationalist\\" first for maximum enjoyment. Both books stand on their own, however, without any prequel.

The country was basically divided into Red Spain - the Republicans, and Black Spain, represented by the landed elite, committed to a feudal system and Franco's cause, Fascists, the urban bourgeoisie, the Roman Catholic Church, and other conservative sectors. The number of casualties is only an estimate, but suggests that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were killed. Many of these deaths, however, were not the results of military battles, but the outcome of brutal mass executions perpetrated by both sides.<br /><br />During the war in Spain, approximately 38,000 non-Spanish, anti-fascist volunteers from fifty-two countries, took up arms to defend the Republican cause against Franco, who was aided by Hitler and Mussolini. Twenty-eight hundred Americans, in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, fought here alongside their Spanish and international comrades-in-arms from 1937 through 1938. These men and women believed the defense of the Republic represented the last hope of stopping the spread of international fascism. Most of the volunteers were not political, but idealists who were determined to \\"make Madrid the tomb of fascism.\\" English novelist, essayist, and critic, George Orwell was one of them.<br /><br />Orwell was not just a writer, he was a partisan and he was a political idealist. A revolutionary Socialist, not a Communist, he was affiliated with the Independent Labor Party (I.L.P.). Orwell originally traveled to Spain in 1937 to observe and to write, but he almost immediately enlisted in the militia as a private. At that time there were several political parties in Loyalist Spain, and each party had its own militia units, soon to be absorbed into the People's Army. Because Orwell's letters of introduction were originally from the I.L.P., which had connections to the P.O.U.M. (Workers Party of Marxist Unification - a small group of anti-Stalinists), he joined a unit of that party. Most volunteers fought Fascism under one of the Communist or Socialist banners, in a coalition effort, with the intention of working through political and social differences when the war was won. Until that time, he believed that the anti-Fascists should work together in a united front.<br /><br />When Orwell arrived in Barcelona, the Anarchists were still virtually in control of Catalonia. It was the first time Orwell had ever been in a town where the working class \\"was in the saddle.\\" He clearly conveys the sense of excitement of seeing the city under de facto workers' control, and the intensity of the revolutionary spirit which coursed through the people. \\"Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said 'Senor' or 'Don' or even 'Usted;' everyone called everyone else 'Comrade' and Thou,' and said 'Salud' instead of 'Buenos Dias.'\\" It seemed like all men were equal, and there was hope in the air. \\"All this was queer and moving. There was much in it I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it almost immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for.\\"<br /><br />After the most elementary training, Orwell spent weeks of bitter cold and hardship on the Zaragoza front, but saw little action. He was briefly hospitalized with a festering hand wound, and then returned to action - and this time there was plenty of it. Orwell's description of the fighting and conditions at the front is extraordinarily vivid and chilling. He went on leave to meet his wife in Barcelona in April, and thus was in the thick of things for the P.O.U.M. uprising. The situation in Barcelona had changed drastically since those initial days when everyone appeared on equal footing. There were startling changes in the \\"social atmosphere.\\" Perhaps initially, everyone had worn overalls and shouted revolutionary slogans \\"as a way of saving their skins.\\" Now, smart hotels and restaurants were once again filled with the wealthy, while food prices had jumped enormously for the working-class. The poor experienced serious and recurrent shortages. The differences between the luxuries of the \\"haves\\" and the increasing poverty of the majority became obvious. On May 3 a struggle began between the syndicalist unions and the Catalonian police force. Orwell saw the issue as a clear one: \\"I have no particular love for the idealized 'worker' as he appears in the bourgeois Communist's mind, but when I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.\\" He spent three nights on the roof of a moving-picture house, watching over P.O.U.M. headquarters until troops came from Valencia, and the street fighting stopped.<br /><br />After ten days back at the front Orwell received a near lethal neck wound. By the time he left the hospital he had lost his voice and all movement in his right hand. Warned by friends that the P.O.U.M. had been suppressed, and many members jailed, Orwell escaped to France with his wife. He began to write \\"Homage To Catalonia\\" shortly thereafter. It is a most inspiring and eloquent account of his time fighting with the militia during the Spanish Civil War, not just from a soldiers perspective, but as an eye-witness to one of the most significant events of the 20th century. It first appeared in 1938, but was coldly received by the left-wing intelligentsia, who regarded Communists as heroes of the war. In Orwell's lifetime \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" sold only about fifty copies a year.<br /><br />Many became disillusioned with communism in Spain, but kept silent fearing to harm the Loyalist cause. Orwell's take on the Communist's/Stalin's political machinations, and the overriding priority of the USSR to strengthen Soviet foreign policy, may appear obvious today, but those who put their lives on the line in Spain were much more naive. \\"The whole of Comintern policy is now subordinated (excusably, considering the world situation) to the defense of the USSR.\\" History now documents the Communist betrayal as far more terrible than Orwell conceived. He became an enemy of Soviet style communism as a consequence of his experiences in Spain, and advocated the English brand of socialism. There is an excellent Introduction in this edition by Lionel Trilling which discusses, to some extent, the political wheeling and dealing that occurred on the Republican side: how the Communist Party allied itself with right wing socialists and liberals to crush the P.O.U.M., with the standard Party line that anyone to the left of them were Trotskyists and therefore \\"fascist traitors.\\"<br /><br />This is a masterpiece which brings history to life. For a truly intense portrait of the period, you can do what I did, which was to read Ernest Hemingway's \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" with \\"Homage To Catalonia,\\" back-to-back. My highest recommendations!<br />JANAouted revolutionary slogans \\"as a way of saving their skins.\\" Now, smart hotels and restaurants were once again filled with the wealthy, while food prices had jumped enormously for the working-class.

It is a most inspiring and eloquent account of his time fighting with the militia during the Spanish Civil War, not just from a soldiers perspective, but as an eye-witness to one of the most significant events of the 20th century. It first appeared in 1938, but was coldly received by the left-wing intelligentsia, who regarded Communists as heroes of the war. In Orwell's lifetime \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" sold only about fifty copies a year.     Many became disillusioned with communism in Spain, but kept silent fearing to harm the Loyalist cause. Orwell's take on the Communist's/Stalin's political machinations, and the overriding priority of the USSR to strengthen Soviet foreign policy, may appear obvious today, but those who put their lives on the line in Spain were much more naive. \\"The whole of Comintern policy is now subordinated (excusably, considering the world situation) to the defense of the USSR.\\" History now documents the Communist betrayal as far more terrible than Orwell conceived. He became an enemy of Soviet style communism as a consequence of his experiences in Spain, and advocated the English brand of socialism. There is an excellent Introduction in this edition by Lionel Trilling which discusses, to some extent, the political wheeling and dealing that occurred on the Republican side: how the Communist Party allied itself with right wing socialists and liberals to crush the P.O.U.M., with the standard Party line that anyone to the left of them were Trotskyists and therefore \\"fascist traitors.\\"     This is a masterpiece which brings history to life. For a truly intense portrait of the period, you can do what I did, which was to read Ernest Hemingway's \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" with \\"Homage To Catalonia,\\" back-to-back. My highest recommendations!  JANA	2005-06-30

And that is that the truth does not set you free."	\\"The Narrows,\\" one of Michael Connelly's best Harry Bosch mystery thrillers yet, takes its title from an extremely dangerous area in the Los Angeles River, that narrows to a hazardous ravine which fills with deep rushing water during heavy rains. Kids are warned to \\"stay out of the narrows.\\" The term also symbolizes life's dark recesses, and those sometimes found in one's mind. My review's title is a direct quote from Harry Bosch. By the end of the novel, you will understand what he means...if you don't already.<br /><br />Hieronymus Bosch, named after the painter, recently learned he has a 5 year-old daughter by ex-wife, former FBI agent Eleanor Wish, a professional poker player in Las Vegas. Their little girl, Maddie, has given Harry a new lease on life, so to speak. He simply adores her. She drew a picture for him, of him, and when he asks her what it's about, she tells him it is her Daddy, as a policeman, (pronounced \\"pleaseman\\"). In the drawing he is facing a mean man, Mr. Demon. Bosch asks her who Mr. Demon is, and she responds, \\"He's a wrestler. Mommy says you wrestle with demons and he's the boss of them.\\" So true, so true.<br /><br />As fans know, Harry Bosch retired from the LAPD and is working as a PI. He receives a call from the widow of an old friend, Terry McCaleb, a former FBI profiler. Terry had retired too after a heart transplant. He moved to Catalina Island wanting to get away from the violence of city life and to spend more time with his wife and kids. Health-wise he had been doing extremely well for over five years - he even ran a charter fishing boat, on which he recently dropped dead from heart failure - right before this story opens, as a matter of fact. Graciela McCaleb does not believe that Terry died a natural death. She thinks he was murdered and asks Harry to please look into the situation. Apparently, Terry was not able to let go of his life-long career as a detective - at least not completely. He still had boxes of files on his boat of unsolved serial murders, from around the country, which he was working on, causing serious problems in his marriage. Among the files, Harry finds several photographs, notes and a clipped article from the LA Times attempting to link various men who had gone missing, mysteriously, from Las Vegas casinos over the last 3 years. He also discovers a notepad with clues showing that McCaleb was working solo, on different angles of this case, including a reference to \\"Zzyzx.\\"<br /><br />Another separate, but ultimately connected storyline, informs the reader that Bob Backus, former head of the FBI's Behavioral Sciences Section turned serial killer, featured in Connelly's book \\"The Poet,\\" is still alive and now back in business, diabolically dealing out death while outwitting former colleagues. FBI Agent Rachael Walling, a Backus protege, was outwitted bigtime. Everyone thought she shot and killed him in the prior novel. Not so. For various reasons connected to the case, the FBI punished agent Walling, and sent her out to run a local office in the wilds of North Dakota. After a few years of solitary confinement, she was promoted to a South Dakota regional office, where she at least has some people to talk to. Her career, however, is basically shot - that is, until Backus rises from the proverbial grave asking for his old trainee. He mails a hand-held global-positioning system to FBI Headquarters with a message on it, \\"Hello, Rachel,\\" and a single waypoint in its memory. The waypoint is at the end of Zzyzx Road, in the middle of the Nevada desert. Because Agent Walling knows Backus so well, she is allowed to work the case, on a limited basis.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the most riveting, complex novels I have read in quite a while. Although there are a many references to past books and former characters here, one does not have to be familiar with them to easily understand either their context or the narrative. I had never read the other books and had no problems following this one. I did order both books, however, so there may be a method in Mr. Connolly's mentioning them, besides enriching this plot! Is this an outstanding suspense thriller - heck yes! However, it is also a compelling read for those who know and care about Harry Bosch, and for those who are just becoming acquainted with him also. He is clearly at another crossroads in life. A former partner has asked him to rejoin the LAPD and he is seriously considering it, even though it will mean less time with his daughter.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"The Narrows\\"...and wager that if your read this, and have not yet read Connelly's \\"The Poet,\\" you will probably purchase it as I did!<br /><br />JANAlems following this one.

Emilie Fl&ouml;ge was a talented fashion designer in the glittering fin de siecle world of the Viennese elite. An attractive, elegant woman, she owned a highly respected haute couture salon, whose clients numbered among the city's rich and famous.<br /><br />Brilliant Austrian painter and illustrator, Gustav Klimt, founded the Noveau Art Movement in Vienna, called the Sucession. His famous painting \\"The Kiss\\" epitomizes the eroticism and aesthetics of this turn-of-the-century artistic movement.<br /><br />Emily met Klimt for the first time when she was only twelve years-old. Her father wanted her portrait painted and asked Klimt to do it. Eventually Emily studied painting with the artist, and, over the years became his lover, confidant, muse, business associate and companion. She was also his sister-in-law. Her sister Helene married his brother Ernst.<br /><br />Author Elizabeth Hickey paints a somewhat shallow portrait of the complex relationship between Emilie Fl&ouml;ge and Gustave Klimt, focusing on the undocumented, \\"what has been omitted from historical record,\\" like their conversations, emotions, thoughts and sexual relationship. In lieu of personal journals, the author used her imagination. She researched her subjects well and did rely, for the most part, on historical data when available. Emilie is our narrator, and her tale goes back and forth in time between the period near the end of WWII, at her lakeside retreat in Kammer am Attersee, to Vienna in the last years of the 19th century and the first part of the 20th. Interspersed between the two narratives are Emilie's insightful comments on various paintings by Klimt, which tie into the story: \\"The Sleeping Girl,\\" 1889; \\"Pregnant Nude,\\" 1890; \\"Study for Adele Bloch-Bauer,\\" 1903; Female Nude,\\" 1907; \\"The Kiss,\\" 1907.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the novel, I was left feeling very frustrated. It is definitely a lightweight read. I brought a large appetite to the table and was left hungry. I had hoped \\"The Painted Kiss\\" would be a meaty historical fiction focusing on Klimt and Emilie, but also portraying a glorious epoch - one of brightly lit, cosmopolitan Vienna, with her intellectual, artistic and political figures interacting during a very important period in the city's history. The Austro-Hungarian Empire would soon cease to exist. I also expected a more in-depth character study, and a better developed relationship between Gustave and Emilie. I got neither. Both personages are more one-dimensional than not. I never see their passion...or get much insight into their personalities. Yet these were vivid, almost larger than life individuals. What does come across, however, is the importance of the artist as mentor and teacher in Emilie's life. Parts of the novel are little more than fleshed-out outlines, briefly covering years and events - some characters are mere sketches. If the author is going to invent a narrative, then by all means, go for it!  There is so much that was left unexplored here.<br /><br />As I wrote previously, Ms. Hickey certainly writes well and I believe she is capable of doing much more with a novel. She does give the reader a glimpse of the period, a feel for the city and its people. However, she depicts vignettes, which are not essentially substantial. We are offered an appetizer, not a full meal. I enjoyed the historical figures she brings into the action, like: Alma Schindler-Mahler, Oskar Kokoschka, Egon Schiele, Carl Moll, etc., even though they play small parts. And I particularly liked Emilie's descriptions of dress design and fashion. I just wish there had been more detail.<br /><br />I am going to rate \\"The Painted Kiss\\" 3 Stars, and not quibble about points. There is enjoyment to be had here, and knowledge, especially for those who love art and historical fiction. Also, the author peaked my curiosity about Klimt, as a man and as an artistic genius. I recently read a quotation by him, and was struck by how much it sounds like the person Ms. Hickey described: \\"I have the gift of neither the spoken nor the written word, especially if I have to say something about myself or my work. Even when I have a simple letter to write I am filled with fear and trembling as though on the verge of being sea-sick. For this reason people must do without an artistic or literary self-portrait. And this should not be regretted. Whoever wants to know something about me - as an artist, the only notable thing - ought to look carefully at my pictures and try and see in them what I am and what I want to do.\\"<br /><br />JANAe person Ms. Hickey described: \\"I have the gift of neither the spoken nor the written word, especially if I have to say something about myself or my work.

Vampire fiction has become increasingly popular over the last few years. From Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake series, to Anne Rice's Lestat and his companions of the night, Charlaine Harris' more down-home, southern-style vamp, Christine Feehan's dark Carpathians, and Poppy Brite's sinister goth bloodsuckers, to name a few, modern novelists have been successfully drawing inspiration from Bram Stoker's classic, \\"Dracula,\\" which still has a loyal following 110 years after its initial publication. I must admit I have been a fan since I was first terrified, many years ago, by Bela Lugosi, who played the film version of the fanged count. Author Elizabeth Kostova has come up with a creative and scholarly contemporary version of the mythical vampire tale with her debut novel, \\"The Historian.\\"<br /><br />In 1970's Amsterdam, the teenage daughter of an international diplomat, known only as Paul, discovers an ancient book and a packet of old letters in her father's library addressed to, \\"My dear and unfortunate successor.\\" The young woman, (we never learn her name), lost her mother when she was just a baby, and has led a very sheltered life, cared for by her father and a housekeeper. When she asks her dad, who is a former history professor, about her unusual find, he tells her that Bartholomew Rossi, a brilliant historian, and his own Ph.D. advisor and mentor, wrote the missives, not realizing that Paul would be the \\"unfortunate\\" beneficiary. He also tells her the medieval book had mysteriously come into his possession over 20 years before. Paul was a student then, and one evening, working in the library stacks, he saw that someone had left an old volume on the table, alongside his own texts. Bound in soft faded leather, the book opened almost automatically to the center pages, where he saw a great woodcut of a \\"dragon with spread wings and a long looped tail, a beast unfurled and raging, claws outstretched.\\" In the dragon's claws hung a banner with the word \\"Drakulya.\\" Other than that wood cut, the rest of the pages were empty. When he attempted to discover the owner to return the volume, it kept reappearing with his things. Confiding in his advisor, he learned that Rossi, years before, had received an identical tome, in a similarly mystifying manner. The analytic Rossi also informed Paul that Dracula still lives, centuries after his birth. Thus, Paul became history's sleuth, with an extremely dangerous mission. His PI work eventually took-on life and death importance when Rossi disappeared, leaving a spatter of blood as the only clue. Paul was determined to find him.<br /><br />Over a period of months, Paul reveals to his daughter a series of unusual and horrifying events, all related to his search for his advisor, along with details of both his and Rossi's investigations into the book, and their subsequent search for the truth about Vlad the Impaler or Drakulya - and his hidden tomb.<br /><br />This is a complex, multi-generational, epic tale told during three major time periods: the 1930's, Dr. Rossi's story along with his historical findings concerning Dracula's tomb, history and vampirism; the 1950's, Paul's story, his research and conclusions on the same subject and the search for Rossi; and the 1970's, involving the daughter's detective work and her search for her father, who has also gone missing. Their investigations takes the characters to Oxford, Istanbul, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, France, Italy, Greece and Switzerland. The author brings the varied landscapes to life, and paints spooky scenarios of ruins and old monasteries. Here the historical coexists alongside the supernatural. As all three stories unfold and intertwine, the plot and its resolution inspire a sense of tremendous dread in the reader, when the presence of evil incarnate appears and takes action.<br /><br />Like Bram Stoker who developed his story through journals, diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings, Ms. Kostova uses letters, memoir and archival material to further her narrative. The historical material makes the preternatural aspects of her tale appear even more credible and, for the most part, enriches the reading experience. Stoker's vampire is based on the 15th century Wallacian warrior, Prince Vlad Dracule and he visited Romania and Hungary to read and research original historic manuscripts and local lore. \\"The Historian\\" is based on the same 15th century personage, Vlad the Impaler, (Vlad Tepes), a cruel and sadistic nobleman who is credited with having founded the state of Wallachia, part of present-day Romania. He was also a military commander in Transylvania, where he owned land and a castle-like fortress. Tepes was one of a number of princes and vassals initiated by the Holy Roman Emperor into the Order of the Dragon, an institution, similar to other chivalric orders of the time. The Romanian prince was particularly dedicated to ridding his country of the Turks and putting a halt to the Ottoman invasion. Ms. Kostova spent ten years researching her novel, traveling widely in Eastern Europe, learning languages and gleaning stories and folklore.<br /><br />To the author's credit, she tells a whale of a tale, and puts a most original spin on an old, but always exciting story. Her narrative is almost totally plot driven, however, and because of this the characters' development is almost nil. I found Paul, his daughter, and Rossi to be rather flat, one-dimensional figures. Paul's wife and a Turkish expert on Dracula do bring some life, warmth and humanity into the novel. While almost all the extensive historical background is fascinating, towards the latter part of the 642 page novel, the academic research, especially the migratory patterns and travels of medieval monks, begins to read like a dry doctoral dissertation. I love good historical fiction, based on accurate facts - but historic evidence should not take over or interfere with the primary plot. It should enhance it. Long before the author moved on to another topic, I had reached my limit with monastic life, customs and politics.<br /><br />Ms. Kostova creates moments of extremely heightened suspense, which, unfortunately, she allows to lapse in order to either further the historical data, which is already plentiful, or to go off on a tangent. Rather than prolong the thrills and chills, this approach stultifies. In one instance, the young woman, the daughter, who is a principal narrator, drops out of the storyline for over 150 pages, right in the middle of a most exciting sequence - she's alone in a train compartment with Vlad himself - in order to continue documenting the travels of the monks, etc. These continual interruptions, which usually divert from intense action, are just plain annoying. Overall, the writing could have been much more taut.<br /><br />\\"The Historian\\" is a combination of fiction, history, folklore and tremendous research all revolving around a quest of mythic proportion. I found it to be, for the most part, a compelling read.

A compelling action adventure, this is a tale filled with mystery and suspense, peopled by a cast of extraordinarily vivid characters. It is also the author's finest, and most emotional love story. Although his use of language seems simple, it is deceptively so. Hemingway deals effectively with broad themes here - love, loyalty, trust, courage and honor are some. And of course, \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls,\\" set against the brutal violence of the Spanish Civil War, is probably the definitive work of fiction about this pivotal period in European, and world history.<br /><br />Generalissimo Francisco Franco's fascist troops invaded Spain in July 1936 in order to overthrow the newly established Republic headed by the Popular Front, (composed of liberal democrats, socialists, anarchists, trade unionists, communists and secularists. (If I have left anyone out, I am sorry - this was a truly complex and unique political situation.)<br /><br />The country was basically divided into Red Spain - the Republicans, and Black Spain, represented by the landed elite, committed to a feudal system and Franco's cause, Fascists, the urban bourgeoisie, the Roman Catholic Church, and other conservative sectors. The number of casualties is only an estimate, but suggests that between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people were killed. Many of these deaths, however, were not the results of military battles, but the outcome of brutal mass executions perpetrated by both sides.<br /><br />During the war in Spain, 2,800 American volunteers took up arms to defend the Republican cause against Franco, who was aided by Hitler and Mussolini. Those who fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, from 1937 through 1938, believed the defense of the Republic represented the last hope of stopping the spread of international fascism. These Americans fought alongside approximately 35,000 anti-fascists from fifty-two countries. Most of the volunteers were not political, but idealists who were determined to \\"make Madrid the tomb of fascism.\\" Hemingway's protagonist Robert Jordan, an American professor of Spanish from Missoula, Montana, was one such volunteer.<br /><br />Robert Jordan, an explosives expert, has been ordered to make contact with a small band of partisan fighters in the Guadarrama Mountains of fascist controlled southern Spain. His mission, of critical importance, is to blow up a bridge, at a specific time, to facilitate a simultaneous Republican attack on the city of Segovia. Most of the novel deals with Jordan's relationships with members of the guerilla fighters, including the girl Maria with whom he falls in love. Jordan is described as, \\"a young American of slight political development, but a great way with the Spaniards and a fine 'partizan' record.\\" Neither a Communist nor a Marxist, he is anti-fascist. As is the case with most foreign fighters, he is under Communist discipline/direction, because, in the conduct of the war, they eventually run the \\"show\\" and provide the most effective opposition.<br /><br />Pablo is ostensibly the band's military leader. He has become disillusioned with the fight, cynical and bitter. He is no longer willing to die for any cause. A smart man, but brutal, and cunning in a mean way, he is a complex character. He does have a conscience. Pablo spends much of his time in an alcoholic stupor. When Robert Jordon enters the picture, Pablo's level of animosity reaches new heights, and his comrades, along with Robert, are afraid he will sabotage the mission. He undergoes several changes during the 3 days and 3 nights in which the story takes place.<br /><br />Pilar is Pablo's woman, an extremely strong and savvy person, she is steeped in gypsy lore and superstition, and is probably the novel's most colorful character. She is a fine warrior who can be counted upon to cover one's back in battle. Pilar possesses a big heart. She has cared for Maria and brought the girl back to health. When Robert Jordon joins them, Pilar takes the leadership position over from Pablo, whom she no longer trusts, but still loves. She commands the allegiance of the guerrilla fighters and organizes them into a temporary alliance with \\"El Sordo,\\" another exceptional character. She is the force behind many of the novel's events - stimulating movement, motivating or manipulating people to take action - but for good purpose. Pilar, relates various war stories, and anecdotes, which reflect the cruelty and inhumanity of civil war.<br /><br />Mar&iacute;a's life was shattered by the outbreak of the war. Her father, the mayor, along with her mother, and many of the local citizenry were shot before her eyes by the invading Fascists. Since her mother was not a Republican, but a devout Catholic, she shouted, \\"Viva my husband, the town's mayor,\\" before she died, rather than the more typical, \\"Viva La Republica!\\" Maria was then taken away and brutalized, physically and emotionally, by Franco's soldiers. When the guerilla band blew up the train on which Maria was a prisoner, they carried the dazed and broken girl to their mountain hideaway.<br /><br />A thrilling subplot is developed when Andr&eacute;s, a guerilla, must take an urgent message across the lines to a Republican general. Roberto's entire mission, and much more importantly, the offensive, depends upon the successful and timely delivery of the dispatch. Another important character is old Anselmo, for whom Robert develops a strong attachment.<br /><br />A major portion of the novel is told through the thoughts of Robert Jordan, with flashbacks to meetings with Russians in Madrid, and some reflections on his father and grandfather. Jordon's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway's skill with language and character development. Jordan, at one point comments to himself, that he is his own best companion. Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses. In such a relatively brief period, he begins to love life as never before, because of his feelings for Maria. Even here, however, he accepts that if anything happens to him, he is fortunate to have experienced a lifetime in three and a half days.<br /><br />Again, I cannot write enough in praise of Hemingway's use of language. It is sparse, direct, and extremely beautiful in its descriptiveness. He translated the Spanish intimate \\"tu\\" form  into English. I speak Spanish, and although this may seem a bit awkward initially, it gives a much more accurate feel for the local idiom and the dialogue between Maria and Roberto, (as he is called), and between Roberto and the partisans.<br /><br />This is not only an extraordinary novel, but is one of the most important in American fiction. Hemingway worked as a correspondent in Spain during the Civil War, as a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA). He raised money for the Republicans in their struggle against the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco.<br />JANA, Pilar takes the leadership position over from Pablo, whom she no longer trusts, but still loves.

Hemingway worked as a correspondent in Spain during the Civil War, as a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA). He raised money for the Republicans in their struggle against the Nationalists under General Francisco Franco.   JANA	2005-06-24

I have been a Christine Feehan fan ever since I read \\"Dark Prince,\\" the first novel in the  \\"Carpathian\\" series. Over the last few years, I read every one of those books and found them to be way above average - some are really outstanding. Thus, I was disappointed by the mediocre quality of \\"Oceans of Fire,\\" the third book in the Drake Sister series. I have not read the first two, nor do I plan to do so now. This one lacks the depth, drama and intensity of Ms. Feehan's \\"Dark\\" novels, and while some of the characters are quirky and fun, they lack the complexity and originality I have come to expect from the author's personages. Also, I fear that she is becoming formulaic in her approach to fiction. This is a much lighter work than the Dark novels, but it still has much in common with them, and reminds me a bit of Nora Roberts' \\"Three Sisters Island Trilogy.\\"<br /><br />The Drake sisters number seven, and all have unique magical powers. \\"Oceans of Fire\\" features sister number three, Abigail Drake, a more introspective young woman than her siblings. She is most at home in the ocean and has always had an affinity for the water, sea life, and dolphins in particular. She has dedicated herself and her work, (a Ph.D. in marine biology), to the study of these small cetaceans. Abigail also has the ability to detect lies. This is her magical gift. She is not comfortable with her special talents, however, and is also quite insecure, partially because she had her heart broken by a Russian Interpol-type, covert agent, Alexsandr Volstov, four years before.<br /><br />One day, swimming along the coast of her home in Sea Haven, California, Abigail, and her dolphin friends, witness a murder. She attempts to rescue a second man, a friend of hers who is an innocent bystander. He is shot and wounded, apparently because he was a witness to the crime. As Abbey goes to his aid, she is spotted by the bad guys and becomes a target for hungry sharks, both human and fish.  She doesn't know this, but the perpetrators are members of the Russian mafia who are being pursued by Alexsandr Volstov. Small world! So there's some excitement, the damsel is rescued by her hero, who has never stopped loving her, etc.. Same old, same old.<br /><br />This is not a bad book. If you are a die hard Christine Feehan fan, you will probably like it. And that's OK. For me there's nothing here that has not already been written many, many times before by this author and others. I have to go with a 2 Star rating = below average for redundancy. The least I can hope for in a new book is well written original material.<br /><br />JANAow this, but the perpetrators are members of the Russian mafia who are being pursued by Alexsandr Volstov.

I just finished browsing the cookbook section of a local bookstore, searching for something inspiring and unusual for a wedding shower gift. Linda Carucci's \\"Cooking School Secrets For Real-World Cooks: Tips, Techniques, Shortcuts, Sources, Hints, and Answers to Frequently Asked Questions, Plus 100 Sure-Fire Recipes to Make You a Better Cook\\" came out recently, and after thumbing through it pretty thoroughly, I decided this was the one. In fact, after reading more over coffee, I decided to go back and pick up another copy for myself.<br /><br />Two major attractions, for me, are the recipes - more than 100 exciting and interesting dishes, from soup to sweets. Since the author is of Italian ancestry, the emphasis here is on Italian food - but not every recipe - there's a wide variety. Many of these I don't have in my own extensive collection. And, the most unique aspect of the cookbook, and second major attraction, is the information included under tips, shortcuts and gourmet cooking secrets. I consider myself a good cook and have been creative in the kitchen for many years now, yet many of these tips, and answers to frequently asked questions, are new to me. In fact, for cookbook lovers, much of \\"Cooking School Secrets For Real-World Cooks\\" reads almost like a novel. You have to love cookbooks to understand what I mean!!<br /><br />The book is divided into three major sections. The first is Cooking Basics, and while I am familiar with much of the information, I found the sections on Creative Cooking, How Cooking Changes The Texture And Flavor of Foods,. Cooking With The Seasons, and Understanding Your Palate to be of particular interest. The page layout is attractive and well organized, and there are helpful illustrations throughout.<br /><br />The recipes are in Part Two, and there are many sensational suggestions from stocks, (\\"What is a chinois and why will this make homemade chicken stock better?\\"), soups, (\\"Why are Turkish bay leaves preferable to the California variety?\\"), and broths, to risottos, pastas, seafood, poultry and meat, (\\"Why is a marinade essential when grilling a flank steak?\\"), mouth-watering side dishes, special salads and desserts. There are some wonderful versions of favorite comfort foods, like: Tomato Cheddar Soup; Spaghetti and Meatballs; Chicken Cacciatore; Baked Macaroni with White Cheddar Cheese and Buttered Breadcrumbs; Turkey Mole from Mexico; and Braised Calamari in Red Sauce. And then there are dishes worthy of the most special occasions and guests: Grilled Leg of Lamb with Pomegranate Marinade and Muhammara;  Pork Loin Roast with Vanilla Scented Applesauce; Risotto Primavera with Wild Salmon; Grilled Stuffed Chicken Breasts with Prosciutto, Taleggio, and Pesto; and a fabulous paella. And the desserts - Bittersweet Chocolate Bread Pudding with Kahlua Sauce; Zabaglione with Fresh Berries and Peaches; Grilled Peach Ice Cream Sundaes with Short-Cut Caramel Sauce, a chocoholic cake....and so many more.<br /><br />The last part, Part Three, deals with seasonal recipes, sources, and includes twelve special menus for casual and special occasions.<br /><br />Linda Carucci has worked in the food industry for over 20 years.

Her extremely busy schedule barely allows time for a social life. When Alexandra receives a mysterious offer to perform extensive reconstructive surgery on an unknown patient in New Orleans for a $4 million dollar fee, she smells something fishy. She is told that the prospective patient, one M. Cyprien, is unable to travel and that she will only be required to spend a few days in Louisiana. Obviously, her persistent refusals are ignored, as are her professional commitments. M. Cyprien arranges to have her kidnapped and forcefully brought to his mansion, La Fontaine, in the heart of the New Orleans' Garden District.<br /><br />After recovering from a knock-out dose of ether, a lengthy sleep, nausea and a terrible headache, Alexandra is taken to meet Michael Cyprien, a man without a face - literally. Obviously, he had been horribly injured. Her job would be to construct an entire face, and the underlying structure, from scratch, using just an old portrait to go by. Cyprien presents an unusual challenge as he has a strange disease which causes him to heal almost immediately after any cut or incision is made on his flesh. The primary reason he insisted on Dr. Keller performing the surgery, is because an article written about her in Time Magazine called her the \\"fastest scalpel in the world.\\" She is able to perform accurate surgical procedures very quickly. And a fast scalpel is just what M. Cyprien needs.<br /><br />Fortunately for Cyprien, the miraculous operation succeeds with almost perfect results. Unfortunately for Dr. Alexandra Keller she is given more than money in payment for her services and winds up back in Chicago - in the hospital with almost all the blood drained from her body. Her reclusive former patient is a member of an immortal species called the Darkyn. They have been ruthlessly hunted and destroyed, since they began rising from the dead in the 14th century, by a Vatican-sponsored order of soldier monks dedicated to their annihilation. Alexandra's brother, a priest, has just been recruited by this group of holy Brethren.<br /><br />I am a major fan of good vampire fiction. Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake series is my absolute favorite. I also really enjoy Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire series, Poppy Brite's novels, as well as many of Anne Rice's books. Therefore, when a friend recommended Lynn Viehl's \\"If Angels Burn: A Novel of the Darkyn,\\" I couldn't wait to pick the book up. I am extremely disappointed. The characters are not well developed at all, not are they compelling. There is little chemistry between Alexandra and Michael. I cannot understand why not, for the life of me. All the components are there, except the sizzle. And I am shocked that any author would have a professional, a doctor and romantic protagonist say, \\"Bite my a*s!\\" How terribly unsexy!!<br /><br />There are many possibilities for this series to improve with future novels. The author's premise is a good one. I like the attempt at plot complexity - but please not at the expense of character complexity. I will rate this as average - barely, because it is not boring and does have the potential to be much more. I keep my fingers crossed and look forward to the author's next effort, due out in the autumn, I believe.<br /><br />JANAsly hunted and destroyed, since they began rising from the dead in the 14th century, by a Vatican-sponsored order of soldier monks dedicated to their annihilation.

And Oklahoma, smack in the middle of the Dust Bowl, was a particularly bad place to be. Poverty, alcoholism, (despite Prohibition), violence, racism, and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, were realities of the times. The phrase, \\"Brother, can you spare a dime,\\" came to epitomize the humiliation and hopelessness of 13 million unemployed Americans. Severe droughts made farming impossible, and thousands of folks were driven off their land by starvation. Many blamed the banks and the wealthy financiers for the country's economic devastation. Crime rates rose drastically with the advent of the Great Depression and Prohibition, and robbing banks became an up-and-coming career path. In 1933, police jurisdictions ended at state lines, the FBI was in its infancy, fast cars and machine guns were easily available - if not for sale, than for stealing. On hand to take full advantage of this get rich fast manner of money making was a motley assortment of criminal masterminds, sociopaths, romantics, and adventurers. Some of the era's most famous Public Enemies - John Dillinger, Machine Gun Kelly, Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the Barkers - became iconic figures.<br /><br />Elmore Leonard's latest novel, \\"The Hot Kid,\\" is set in 1930's Oklahoma, against a backdrop of moonshine, speakeasies, mine strikes, oil wildcatters, gangsters, gun molls, prostitutes and plenty of bank robberies. The plot focuses on Carl Webster and Jack Belmont, two colorful characters who could make Bonnie and Clyde, in fact, the entire Barrow Gang, seem boring in comparison. The men's backgrounds are similar but their paths could not have diverged more.<br /><br />Carl Webster, born Carlos, is the grandson of a pureblooded northern Cheyenne woman who married a white man. Their son, Virgil, is Carl's father. His mother, Graciaplena, was Cuban. She is deceased. Virgil, a hero of the Spanish American War, is a pecan farmer, who hit paydirt when oil was discovered on his land. When Carl was just 15, he witnessed an armed robbery and murder in an Okmulgee, Oklahoma drugstore. The kid took it personally because Emmet Long, one of the hold-up men, called him and his father breeds and greasers. He also ate Carl's peach ice cream cone - took it right out of his hand. Later that same year, Carl shot and killed a cattle thief. He warned the man first, \\"If I have to pull my weapon, I'll shoot to kill.\\" This warning, unintentionally, turns into his tag line. Thus, Carl begins to move toward his inevitable career in law enforcement - what else? He eventually becomes a Federal Marshall, who acquires fame early-on for killing a famous bank robber - the very same gangster who once stole his ice cream cone. Webster is also known for possessing a strong code of honor. A clothes horse too, with an enormous ego, he's one hot kid!<br /><br />Another Oklahoma boy, and a peer of Carl's, is Jack Belmont. To be blunt, Jack is a bad seed - a real psycho. His dad, Oris, is an oilman who, unlike Carl's father, found oil the old-fashioned way - he worked for it. His discovery of black gold was no accident, but the end result of a long arduous process. And he is a very wealthy man. His only son, however, is a major disappointment, and no amount of hard work can change that. At age ten, Jack tried to drown his sister, but only succeeded in crippling her for life. He also tried his hand at rape, assault, a racially motivated shooting, and other shenanigans, before getting down to real business. He attempted to blackmail his dad, when he could have easily gotten the money by asking. When Oris cracks-down and thinks to make a man of Jack by having him do some \\"boot camp\\" labor with some of the \\"hard cases\\" working the oil rigs, Jack blows up an oil tank in an explosion that can be seen miles away. Tired of the oil business, he embarks on a bank robbing spree across Oklahoma and Kansas. He does try his hand at kidnapping andforgery first. He thinks he is the hottest kid around! Maybe he means hotheaded!<br /><br />Webster is soon on Jack's trail. And Jack, longing to reach the pinnacle of his career by becoming Public Enemy Number One, hunts Marshall Webster, whom he has sworn to kill. That would bring in plenty of publicity!<br /><br />Tony Antonelli, another important personage, is a journalist who writes for True Crime, and documents the exploits of Carl Webster and of Jack Belmont. He doesn't particularly want to be \\"hot,\\" he just wants to become an award-winning writer. And lovely Louly Brown is definitely hot. She had a \\"thing\\" for Pretty Boy Floyd, loves our protagonist but is drawn to the outlaw life.<br /><br />Elmore Leonard's quirky characters are some of the most fascinating around. He paints a vivid portrait of Depression-era life in the Dust Bowl, including some of America's most notorious crime figures, turned folk heroes. As always his dialogue is great, as is his dark humor. However, for some reason I was not as drawn into the plot as I had hoped to be. Leonard's narrative is well written, and I am fascinated by the period. I just kept waiting for the main story to begin, and when I discovered I was in the middle of it, I felt kind of let down. I seem to be the only reader, of the hundreds of thousands who bought this book, who feels this way - so chalk it up to my quirkiness. I definitely recommend the novel and am not at all sorry I read it.<br /><br />This is Elmore Leonard's 40th novel, proving that some talented, creative people are not slowed down by the process of aging.<br />JANAs he is the hottest kid around!

Having read Philip Kerr's outstanding \\"Berlin Noir Trilogy,\\" I looked forward to the publication of his latest novel, \\"Hitler's Peace.\\" I was amazed to find myself pushing to get through a plodding narrative based on unlikely events, with totally unrealistic characters. This is, by far, inferior to the author's previous historical thrillers. I am doubly disappointed because I am fascinated by the history of WWII, and having read extensively about that period, I had hoped for a creative fictional account of military and political goings-on in 1943. I would have thought that having authored other novels about the Third Reich, Kerr would have no problem doing so here.<br /><br />\\"Hitler's Peace,\\" an alternate history of sorts, revolves around the Teheran Conference, conducted in November 1943 by Allied leaders Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin to discuss military strategy and post World War II Europe. Hitler has realized that, after losing hundreds of thousands of soldiers at Stalingrad, Germany has all but lost the war. Roosevelt has demanded nothing less than the Reich's unconditional surrender. Fearful of what a Russian invasion of the Fatherland would mean, Hitler is secretly exploring possibilities for a separate peace with the British and Americans. Unbeknownst to the Fuehrer, Heinrich Himmler has put out similar peace feelers, and is not opposed to having Hitler assassinated and staging a coup. When a mass grave containing the bodies of over 4000 Polish officers is discovered in the Katyn Forest, near Smolensk, the situation becomes more complex. It is clear that the Russians, who perpetrated this atrocity, wished to rid themselves of potential Polish leaders before they take over the country. The Germans believe that this disclosure will alienate English and American leaders towards Stalin. Subsequently, however, a letter is brought to light revealing the terrible and uncalled-for deaths of more than 50,000 German POWs in Russian camps.<br /><br />Philosopher Willard Mayer, an OSS operative, is central to the plot. He has been chosen by FDR to investigate the Katyn Forest incident, and to act as the presidents envoy during the Teheran Conference. At one time, while a student in Vienna, Meyer was a Communist who spied on the Germans for the Russians. He most definitely does not want this information brought to light. German General Schellenberg, the novel's  other focal character, has created an alternate plan to the peace negotiations. He wants to kill the Allied leaders in Teheran.<br /><br />Franklin D. Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Hitler, Himmler, Borman, Goering all play active roles in the novel, and Kim Philby, Lord Victor Rothschild, author Rosamund Lehmann, Evelyn Waugh and other members of the rich and famous set make guest appearances. As I wrote previously, many of these personages and their actions do not ring true. For example, Harold Adrian Russell (Kim) Philby was a senior officer in the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) for many years, but was actually an agent of the Soviet KGB, who later defected. In the book he discusses his plan to go to the Soviets if the Brits decide on a separate peace with Nazi Germany. He talks about this openly at a cocktail party with a man, a US government employee, he hasn't seen for years. With this type of indiscretion, Philby hardly would have been as successful a spy as he turned out to be. The incident is ludicrous, and there are others like it. I find it difficult to empathize with any of the self-absorbed individuals who people this book, and am hard-pressed to recommend it to anyone, when I barely got through it myself.<br /><br />JANAmps.  <br /> <br />Philosopher Willard Mayer, an OSS operative, is central to the plot.

Pawel presents the reader with a very interesting dilemma from the first page of her most original whodunit, the Edgar Award-winning \\"Death Of A Nationalist.\\" How does the reader empathize with a protagonist who is a member of the Fascist cause, one of the victors in Spain's bitter, bloody Civil War? How does one embrace, in a literary fashion, someone who works to enforce Fascist policies, especially when we meet him in the act of killing an innocent civilian?<br /><br />The novel is set in Madrid, 1939, in the terrible aftermath of a war which ravaged Spain from 1936 to 1939. Generalissimo Francisco Franco and the Nationalists have prevailed over the Republicans, who backed the democratically elected and progressive Popular Front government. Large numbers of American volunteers went to Spain during this period, under the auspices of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, to defend the Spanish Republic against the military rebellion led by General Franco, who was aided by Hitler and Mussolini. The men and women, who fought from 1937 through 1939, represented  the last hope of stopping the spread of international fascism. The Lincolns fought alongside the Spanish and approximately 35,000 anti-fascists from fifty-two countries who, like themselves, sought to \\"make Madrid the tomb of fascism.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Pawel accurately paints a grim portrait of post-war Madrid, a city settling into the \\"normality\\" of an uneasy peace. Atrocities have devastated both sides. The populace's \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\" attitude will continue for many years, and at this early stage, battle scars are still fresh, as are memories of dead loved ones, and festering political wounds. Many areas of the city are in ruins, and food shortages leave much of the population hungry - some are literally starving. Carlos Tejada Alonso y L&eacute;on is an officer, (sergeant), of the Guardia Civil, a rank rarely obtained by a young man not yet thirty years-old. Tejada is the second son of a wealthy landowner, a conservative and a staunch Nationalist. A Falangist, who backed Franco from the beginning, he studied law in Salamanca before joining the Guardia. Now he enforces the laws and policies of the Generalissimo's authoritarian government, and searches for \\"enemies of the state,\\" usually Republicans, who are jailed, sometimes tortured, and frequently killed. Tejada is basically a decent man, a hero of the siege of Toledo - and while I am certainly not an apologist for Fascism, (on the contrary), there must have been some good people who fought and believed in the Nationalist cause, even if they were on the wrong side of history. One has to read the book to determine if it is possible to accept Sergeant Carlos Tejada Alonso y L&eacute;on for the man he is.<br /><br />The story opens with the sergeant and one of his subordinates investigating the death of a fellow Guardia member. Reports have it that the man was shot by a sniper. Unfortunately, when Tejada arrives at the murder scene, he discovers the corpse of his best friend, who shared with him the long hardships of Toledo. He also finds a young woman near the body, clutching a notebook in her hands. After some words with her, he decides she is a \\"red,\\" (she is wearing a red scarf, after all), and probably the murderer. He shoots her in cold blood. This brutal act will change him forever. Later, as he investigates further and begins to have doubts, he becomes driven to seek justice. During the investigation process, he comes into contact with various \\"rebels,\\" and a lovely Socialist schoolteacher, Elena Fernandez. As he meets more politically diverse people, and converses with those who would have been adversaries a short time before, the more human their faces become to him. Tejado also begins to discover flaws in his own personal and professional attitude.<br /><br />This novel is just plain fascinating. Its originality is refreshing and the taut, intelligent, well written narrative is far different from theformulaic crime novels usually found on the market. Ms. Pawel's anti-hero Tejada is a complex character, struggling with his personal political beliefs, his firmly entrenched dedication to justice and the law, and the grim post-war situation he finds himself in. He begins to understand that in the tonal scale of life, the differences between right and wrong are more subtle and variegated than black and white. The author's descriptions of the wounded streets of Madrid are eerie and unsettling - as is the overall ambiance.<br /><br />\\"Death of a Nationalist\\" is the first of a series of novels featuring Sergeant Tejada.

The novel also tells the poignant personal stories of a man and a woman, both spies - ostensibly for opposite sides,  whose lives become forever intertwined after their meeting in WWII Lisbon.<br /><br />Captain Karl Voss, a young officer in the Abwehr, the German military intelligence organization, had studied physics at Heidelberg University before the war and showed great promise for a brilliant career. In January of 1943, he was well aware that Nazi Germany was failing in its efforts to conquer the world. His beloved brother was recently killed at Stalingrad, and his father, General Heinrich Voss, had been forced into retirement because he refused to obey orders to kill all Jews and partisans encountered in the Russian campaign. Karl is recruited by like-minded, disillusioned Army officers to become a double agent - an enemy of the Nazi state, but a loyal defender of Germany. His job is to go to Lisbon as the German Legation's military attache and security officer. There he will make contact with representatives of the British Secret Intelligence Service to negotiate a separate peace, excluding the Russians, whose invasion does not bode well for the German people. Stalin had stated at the Teheran Conference that up to a hundred thousand German officers would have to be executed, and that he would need four million German slaves to rebuild Russia. Unfortunately, shortly after Voss' arrival in Portugal, the Abwehr was dissolved and its functions taken over by Heinrich Himmler.<br /><br />Twenty year-old Andrea Aspinall, a talented Oxford educated mathematician, has a facility for languages also. She is fluent in Portuguese, her deceased father's native tongue, and also in German. At university she is recruited and trained by the British Secret Intelligence Service and sent to Lisbon. Her cover name is Anne Ashworth and she works as a secretary for a Shell Oil executive, another British agent, translating German scientific documents into English for the Americans. That's her day job. Anne's living quarters are with a wealthy Irish businessman, Patrick Wilshere, and his wife, a Portuguese woman of noble birth. No lover of Great Britain, Wilshere is suspected of selling wolfram and raw diamonds to the Germans, and doing all in his considerable power to help the Nazis win the war. Anne, in a most dangerous environment, is to obtain as much pertinent information as possible to assist the Allies in their \\"endgame.\\"<br /><br />In July, 1944, Lisbon is a city of spies. It is probably the only place in war-torn Europe where all sides are able to meet on equal grounds. Yet, behind polite facades, a bitter war is being waged. Portugal was extremely important economically to both Axis and Allied Powers, because of the mineral wolfram. After the Allies landed in Normandy, all the wolfram mines were closed. However, there remained a vital trade in industrial diamonds, used to produce the machinery necessary to construct the German rockets that were bombarding London. Frightening rumors were circulating about Hitler's secret weapon which would win the war for the Third Reich. It was feared that with new German technology, the rockets might end-up carrying atomic warheads.<br /><br />In this chilling and paranoid environment, it is almost impossible to imagine two dedicated agents, one Axis, one Allied, meeting and falling in love.<br /><br />The novel is divided into three parts. The first is in wartime Lisbon. The second part is set during the height of the Cold War in London and East Berlin. And finally, the surprising denouement, with glasnost and the collapse of the Berlin Wall, brings all loose ends together - and closes the circle on all that began so many years before.<br /><br />Mr. Wilson is a writer of rich imagination and extraordinary narrative ability. He is obviously fascinated with the \\"spy culture,\\" and believes we are all inherently spies, some even to the point of addiction. We all possess secrets and are fascinated by the secrets of others. Perhaps this is why the book is so thrilling - it is filled with enigma. All the characters are developed with imagination and subtlety. The author takes Andrea/Anne on a life journey from late adolescence, through her middle years to old age, and does it in a most credible and unusual way. He won the CWA Gold Dagger Award for \\"A Small Death in Lisbon,\\" which I read and thought brilliant. \\"The Company of Strangers\\" is no less so. One of the most unique and compelling novels I have read in this genre.<br />JANAelieves we are all inherently spies, some even to the point of addiction.

Noah Braddock, surfer dude extraordinaire turned private investigator, makes his literary debut in \\"Killer Swell,\\" an unusual whodunit which proves to be well worth a reader's investigation. Braddock, a character as fresh as the clean salt air wafting over his tiny beach front apartment in Mission Beach, near San Diego, is the antithesis of the typically brooding, cynical, divorced, alcohol-guzzling, investigators who \\"protagonize\\" so many sleuth books nowadays. He's a Californian!! And he is young - not quite thirty, smart, attractive, athletic, (he still rides the waves), witty, and definitely not lonely. He drinks beer, but otherwise I get the feeling that his body is a temple - although others are wont to beat up on it, especially if they don't like the questions he asks! Noah's got a couple of delightfully quirky friends, who would be extremely noir if they weren't continually drenched by the left coast sun. And he has a lush, lovely lady - sort of. Ambivalent Homicide Detective Liz Santangelo cannot decide whether to cuff Noah and read him his rights, or to take him home with her at night.<br /><br />In \\"Killer Swell\\" Braddock learns that his first love, Kate Crier, has gone missing when her distraught mother, Marilyn, asks him to find her. Marilyn and Ken Crier, a wealthy society couple living in La Jolla, did everything in their power to break up their daughter's relationship with the socially inferior, and impoverished, Noah Braddock during the young twosome's high school years. They finally succeeded, and Kate and Noah have not seen each other for well over a decade. The Criers despised Noah, and the feeling was mutual, thus his shock that they are seeking to employ him now. He reluctantly accepts the case. He feels he owes it to Kate, in spite of his loathing for her parents.<br /><br />The usual suspects are questioned, beginning with Kate's husband, Dr. Randall Tower, who is not very forthcoming. Apparently there were marital problems. Kate is unhappy, and a separation had been discussed, but nothing which would make her run away and stay away for over a week. For that matter, both Criers are evasive and only open up when our PI threatens to quit. Emily Crier, Kate's older sister, and Braddock's friend from school, looks to him for comfort and gives him some real clues as to what was going on in her sister's life.<br /><br />The next step is a visit to the hotel where Kate stays when in town. That she chooses to go to the Marriott rather than her parent's home, or her sister's, says something about family relationships. The woman at the front desk tells Braddock that Kate had checked out two days early. In the hotel parking lot Noah spots an isolated Mercedes and gets a sick feeling in his gut. The smell emanating from the trunk says dead body loud and clear. It is Kate, and her life is long gone.<br /><br />This fast-paced mystery is not terrible complex. However there's lots of excitement and a few unexpected twists and turns which will interest even the most discerning reader. The novel's real strength lies in the winning cast of characters, especially Braddock's buddies, his lady and even a major villain. And I am fascinated by surfing, a sport I tried but gave-up due to the fact I could never make it to a standing position. While there's not much board time, what there is is beautifully descriptive. I'm fairly picky when it comes to mysteries and thrillers. There are so many of these beach books on the market. Yet, I know I will come back for more of Noah Braddock. Jeff Shelby has created a character who is a real character. The narrative is exceptionally well written and the dialogue is excellent. What a debut! Way to go!!<br /><br />JANAhappy, and a separation had been discussed, but nothing which would make her run away and stay away for over a week.

David Francis' stark, beautifully crafted debut novel, \\"The Great Inland Sea,\\" takes its title from a vast desert-like area in Australia's New South Wales. This harsh, dry land was once, (hundreds of millions of years ago), a Great Inland Sea, where shells and fossilized sea creatures can still be found. Over the course of the narrative the reader discovers what our protagonist eventually learns in this unusual coming of age story, that people and things change. Neither the individuals who play a part in our lives, nor the events, are as predictable or as apparent as they seem. Day, a young man, is our narrator, and this is his story.<br /><br />He left the family farm located near Maude, New South Wales, when he was twelve years-old. His father, Darwin, and his deceased mother, Emily, provided an emotional environment too dysfunctional for any child to thrive. Combined with the harsh physical climate, it's a wonder Day survived. He took-off after his mother's mysterious death, with just a pony to his name. Selling the animal in the nearest town, he made his way toward Melbourne, and found a job as a jockey along the way. He worked for the Delauney's at Sutton Grange for six years, breaking, exercising and caring for young thoroughbreds. Then, in 1953, he escorted a horse named Unusual to America.<br /><br />On Maryland's eastern shore, Day meets Callie, a determined young woman, with a hard shell around her heart. She is set on becoming the first woman jockey...and a successful one at that! Day pours all his stored-up loneliness and intense yearning for love into his feelings for her. Emotionally scarred by a brutal childhood, Callie is not capable of reciprocating his love with much more than occasional affection, rejection and abuse. When thwarted, Day's feelings become obsessive. Again, his most critical needs, his overwhelming thirst for love, are met with a harsh, barren landscape. Haunted by his past in Australia, he returns to his father's farm and his mother's grave, to face his ghosts.<br /><br />There he learns of his mother's girlhood in Vienna where she was an opera singer, and of a mysterious Argentinean man, Dickie Del Mar, who came to the farm once for an extended stay. Other than his mother, Del Mar was the only person Day remembers as showing him affection and paying him attention. Callie and Day remain in touch - usually by letter or telephone, the contact always instigated by him. Then she writes with an invitation. She asks him to travel to Mexico, to a horse show in Puebla. And so he leaves Australia for a second time, and initiates a scenario which puts the past and present on collision course.<br /><br />The troubling story of Day's childhood, and the lives of his mother and father are darkly gothic in nature. A constant air of suspense permeates the narrative and Mr. Francis is unusually good at building tension and sustaining it. The prose is sparse but lyrical and the descriptions, especially of the Australian Outback, excite the senses and bring the landscape to life in the mind's eye. I am fascinated by the author's imagery of the sea, swimming and potential death by drowning - especially in the context of a desert environment.<br /><br />\\"The Great Inland Sea\\" is a compelling, thought-provoking novel, and also a tautly written mystery.

I was seriously deprived as a child and never read the \\"Wind in the Willow,\\" nor did I have it read to me. Given that my Mom is an avid reader and encouraged me to be one also, I don't know why this classic was omitted from my early reading repertoire. When I met my husband, he discovered I had never read Kenneth Grahame's book, and told me it was/is one of his favorites. So, the first gift I ever received from him was a copy of \\"Wind in the Willows,\\" inscribed \\"A kid's book for a special lady, who is a child at heart.\\" Now the marvelous adventures of the Mole, Rat, Toad and Badger still delight, as they did that first time many years ago, when I was 19 years-old. If you are older than eight, the reading level says 4-8, and are not familiar with this tale, by all means get yourself a copy and enter the magical world created by Mr. Grahame, who wrote this as a series of bedtime stories for his son in 1908. As far as literature goes, the writing is quite lyrical, really beautiful and inventive, and so intelligent. A samples below, describes the scenery of new surroundings:<br /><br />\\"He thought his happiness complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen such a river before - this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates who shook themselves free, and were caught and held again. All was a-shake and a-shiver, glints and gleams and sparkles, rustle and swirl, chatter and bubble. The Mole was bewitched, entranced, fascinated.\\"<br /><br />Grahame writes this exuberant, humorous fantasy, about the adventures of four close friends, all animals, who live in the English countryside, the Wild Wood, to be exact. He tells the tale from the animals' points of view, emphasizing the etiquette and sensibilities of woodland creatures, and those who make their homes and livings underground and on river banks. Throughout his narrative he explains how animal society works, and how non-human creatures perceive the world around them.<br /><br />Toad, of glorious Toad Hall, is a spoiled, rich, rather eccentric creature, who is accustomed to doing exactly as he wishes. Reckless, he perpetually gets himself and his friends into trouble. They count on it, in fact. Ever a free spirit, with the money to indulge his whims, Toad discovers a new passion - motor cars. Of course he involves diligent, kind-hearted Mole, very clever Water Rat, and wise, reclusive Badger in his madness, and invariably they extricate themselves from the consequences, rescuing their friend Toad as well.<br /><br />President Theodore Roosevelt and his family greatly enjoyed \\"Wind in the Willows.\\" He wrote to the author praising the book.

I first read Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" the summer between 4th and 5th grades. I was absolutely riveted by the story and characters and clearly remember sitting on the porch steps, my nose in the book. I cried when I reached the conclusion, because I was afraid that I had just read the best book in the world, and that I would never find anything else as good. The local librarian convinced me otherwise. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough - for people of all ages. It will always have a special place in my heart.<br /><br />Ms. Alcott writes about four young women, living in New England, during a period of much strife in America - the Civil War. They are self sufficient, creative and well educated, and each chooses a different life path, traditional and non. Considering the period when the book was written, the author's views on opportunities open to females, restricted though they were by society, is refreshing and liberating. Of course, this was not my focus as a nine year-old. The novel is long, but that never bothered me as a young girl, or much later when I reread it. I didn't want the story to end, actually.<br /><br />Sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March and their beloved Marmee, (who offers her daughters guidance, comfort and unconditional love), learn to live in genteel poverty while their father, a doctor, is away treating wounded soldiers. This beautifully written classic, chronicles the girls' adolescence through womanhood, with all their trial, tribulations, and joys.<br /><br />Much of the novel focuses on Jo, the second daughter, and a gifted writer. She is very much a tomboy, and an avid reader who writes plays which the girls act-out with delight and exuberance. When they meet their new next-door neighbor, the wealthy, lonely Theodore Laurence, (called Laurie), they befriend him and invite him to become the only male member of their exclusive theater ensemble. Laurie becomes an important person in all of their lives, and the March family in his. Margaret, (Meg), the oldest, is quite lovely - a young woman with traditional values and tastes. Sensitive Elizabeth, (Beth), is the most fragile sister -quiet, caring and timid. And Amy, the youngest, is a gifted artist, with a tremendous sense of self-importance.<br /><br />Together they cope with their father's absence and their fear for his safety, severe illness in the family, a death, lack of money precluding many of life's small luxuries, romance, love, marriage and many glorious adventures. In the second part of the novel, Meg marries, Jo's writing becomes a priority, as does Amy's art. During a time of impoverishment, they learn how good it feels to give to those who are much needier than themselves. This aspect of the book is very moving. Ms Alcott brings her characters to life on the page. All of them, even minor personages, are extremely well developed.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" was first published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. The author drew from her own childhood experiences to dramatize the lives of the March family. The character \\"Marmee\\" is based on her own mother, Abigail May, (Abba), Alcott, whom she described as having: \\"A great heart that was home for all.\\" Like Marmee, Abba was loving and passionate about women's rights, temperance, and abolition.

Kevin Boyle, a history professor, and National Book Award-winning author of \\"Arc of Justice: A Saga of Civil Rights, and Murder in the Jazz Age,\\" has written the best true crime book I have ever read, including Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood.\\"  A Detroit native, Boyle tells one of the city's most important civil rights episodes - the September night in 1925 when black people took up arms to defend their home from a white mob. His narrative of the sensational murder trial, which ignited the Civil Rights Movement, is electrifying! Boyle's research is meticulous. He interweaves the incidents leading up to the murder, the police investigation, and the courtroom drama of the trial, with history that documents the volatile America of the 1920's. He re-creates the Sweet family's inspirational journey from slavery through the Great Migration to the middle class. \\"Arc Of Justice\\" reads like a suspense thriller! I was riveted to the page. I thought I was relatively well informed about the Civil Rights Movement. However, I was amazed at how little I did know, especially about the period before the mid-1950's. I learned so much from this book about the significant and fascinating history of the Great Migration and many of the events which took place afterwards, especially in the North during the 1920's.<br /><br />\\"I have always been interested in the colored people. I had lived in America because I wanted to...The ancestors of the Negroes came here because they were captured in Africa and brought to America in slave ships, and had been obliged to toil for three hundred years without reward. When they were finally freed from slavery they were lynched in court and out of court, and driven into mean, squalid outskirts and shanties because they were black....I realize that defending Negroes, even in the North, was no boy's job, although boys were usually given the responsibility.\\"<br /><br />With these words, Attorney Clarence Darrow, a civil libertarian, best known for defending John T. Scopes in the so-called \\"Monkey Trial,\\" agreed to act as co-defense counsel for Dr. and Mrs. Ossian Sweet, as well as two of the doctor's brothers, Otis and Henry Sweet and seven of their friends and colleagues. They were all accused of conspiracy to commit murder, and murder in the first degree. The young, upright Sweet family's real crime was to buy a bungalow in a previously all-white working class neighborhood in Detroit, and move into their home, on September 8, 1925. A few friends and relatives helped them make the move and volunteered to remain with the family in case of trouble.<br /><br />When rumors circulated of the purchase of the house on Garland Ave. by a Negro family, a new neighborhood improvement association was quickly formed. The newly appointed secretary arranged for a meeting to be held in the local school auditorium. The crowd of middle class whites attending overflowed the large room. This new organization was one of many neighborhood associations established across America, at that time, which \\"unleashed real estate market's arsenal of discriminatory practices, trying to impose restrictive constraints.\\" The principal speaker for the meeting was a representative from another local group that had successfully driven African American, Dr. Alexander Turner, from his new home the month before. The message, \\"keep Garland safe from colored invasion.\\"<br /><br />The grandson of run-away slaves, Ossian Sweet put himself through college and medical school by stoking coal and waiting tables. Howard University, where he studied medicine, was the nation's preeminent black university. Although he had achieved the long-held dreams of his family, to become a respected member of the middle class, he still had terrifying memories from his childhood in Florida, of lynchings and unspeakable violence against black people. His childhood fears, exacerbated by his new neighbors' threats, propelled the doctor to invite his brothers and some friends to keep watch with him in case violence broke out. Sweet was well aware that his country was deeply divided, seething with hatred of minorities, (blacks in particular). The burgeoning presence of the Ku Klux Klan in the North, (by 1924, Detroit's Klan had 35,000 members), with their very public and menacing rallies, was extremely threatening. The summer of 1925 had been particularly hot. There was racial violence almost everywhere in urban Detroit. By the night of September 8, the tension in his neighborhood was palpable. Although frightened, Sweet thought he was ready to defend his home. He prepared himself for the expected mob and bought nine guns and enough ammunition for himself and the others, to be used only if necessary. He also notified the Detroit police of his planned move and asked for protection. The Sweet's infant daughter stayed at his wife's mother's home.<br /><br />A crowd of 100 to 150 people gathered in front of the Sweet house for much of the night of September 8, but except for one barrage of rocks thrown against the house, no violence occurred. The next evening Gladys Sweet worked in the kitchen preparing a meal, while  Ossian and his acquaintances played cards. At one point, they looked out the windows to see a swelling crowd filling the area surrounding their home - nearly 1000 people. According to the Sweets, stones began flying. The eleven people, shut up in the house on Garland Ave. were very nervous and afraid. Threats of violence and racial epithets were audible. Ossian Sweet said later, \\"the whole situation filled me with an appalling fear - a fear that no one could comprehend but a Negro, and that Negro, one who knew the history behind his people.\\"<br /><br />After rocks smashed through an upstairs window, shots were fired from the Sweet home. One of the bullets struck thirty-three-year-old Leon Breiner in the back as he stood nearby. Another man  lay with a bullet wound to the leg. Six policeman, (who had been present at the time of the shooting, but did nothing to restrain the mob), entered the Sweet home and arrested the eleven occupants, including Gladys Sweet. At police headquarters, the Sweets and their friends were told, for the first time, that a man had been killed and another wounded. An assistant prosecutor informed them that he planned to recommend first degree murder warrants against all eleven, and then promptly jailed them.<br /><br />From her jail cell, Gladys proclaimed, \\"Though I suffer and am torn loose from my fourteen-month-old baby, I feel it is my duty to the womanhood of my race. If I am freed I shall return and live at my home on Garland Avenue.\\"<br /><br />Author Boyle describes, brilliantly, how the end of WWI launched the Great Migration of Negroes from the rural South to the urban North. \\"There were 5700 blacks living in Detroit in 1910, 91,000 in New York City. Fifteen years later, Detroit had 81,000 black citizens, NYC almost 300,000.\\" By 1925, Americans were deeply divided by hatred for those who were \\"different;\\" those who were not white and Protestant.<br /><br />This popular history, which explores the politics of racism and the bitter battles within the nascent Civil Rights movement, compels the reader to keep turning the pages. The writing is fluid, intelligent and lyrical at times. \\"Arc Of Justice's\\"  conclusion will, shock and surprise. There are 8 pages of color photographs included. This is one book I will keep and recommend highly to others. Kudos!<br />JANAbroke out.

The next evening Gladys Sweet worked in the kitchen preparing a meal, while  Ossian and his acquaintances played cards. At one point, they looked out the windows to see a swelling crowd filling the area surrounding their home - nearly 1000 people. According to the Sweets, stones began flying. The eleven people, shut up in the house on Garland Ave. were very nervous and afraid. Threats of violence and racial epithets were audible. Ossian Sweet said later, \\"the whole situation filled me with an appalling fear - a fear that no one could comprehend but a Negro, and that Negro, one who knew the history behind his people.\\"     After rocks smashed through an upstairs window, shots were fired from the Sweet home. One of the bullets struck thirty-three-year-old Leon Breiner in the back as he stood nearby. Another man  lay with a bullet wound to the leg. Six policeman, (who had been present at the time of the shooting, but did nothing to restrain the mob), entered the Sweet home and arrested the eleven occupants, including Gladys Sweet. At police headquarters, the Sweets and their friends were told, for the first time, that a man had been killed and another wounded. An assistant prosecutor informed them that he planned to recommend first degree murder warrants against all eleven, and then promptly jailed them.     From her jail cell, Gladys proclaimed, \\"Though I suffer and am torn loose from my fourteen-month-old baby, I feel it is my duty to the womanhood of my race. If I am freed I shall return and live at my home on Garland Avenue.\\"    Author Boyle describes, brilliantly, how the end of WWI launched the Great Migration of Negroes from the rural South to the urban North. \\"There were 5700 blacks living in Detroit in 1910, 91,000 in New York City. Fifteen years later, Detroit had 81,000 black citizens, NYC almost 300,000.\\" By 1925, Americans were deeply divided by hatred for those who were \\"different;\\" those who were not white and Protestant.    This popular history, which explores the politics of racism and the bitter battles within the nascent Civil Rights movement, compels the reader to keep turning the pages. The writing is fluid, intelligent and lyrical at times. \\"Arc Of Justice's\\"  conclusion will, shock and surprise. There are 8 pages of color photographs included. This is one book I will keep and recommend highly to others. Kudos!  JANA	2005-06-10

Distinguished historian, Martin Gilbert, one of the world's leading authorities on the Holocaust, culminated three years of extensive pictorial research with this new and important illustrated volume, \\"Never Again: A History Of The Holocaust.\\" Many of the book's photographs are from the massive permanent exhibit at the Imperial War Museum, London.  Owing much to \\"those who have assembled the basic Documentation,\\" his text is well written, easy to follow, and allows the horror of the events to speak for itself<br /><br />In this visual chronology, Gilbert's narrative compellingly captures the richness of Jewish life in Europe before the rise of Nazism, the effects of antisemitism, and, ultimately, the destruction of much of European Jewry. Also portrayed is evidence of the desperate search by many Jews for safe haven, after 1933, from the horror which was to come. The knowledge that a multitude believed that such a thing as the systematic mass murder of millions was impossible, and/or that the threat would pass, is what truly consternates and deeply saddens. However, there were few places of safety to accommodate even those who did want to leave their homes.<br /><br />Gilbert documents German military conquests and the spread of Nazism, beginning with Poland, and ending with Italy, Greece and Hungary; the establishment of Jewish ghettos throughout Europe, and life, (and death), in these walled-in communities from which few could escape; individual acts of defiance and group revolts in these ghettos - most famously the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, led by the Jewish Fighting Organization (ZOB); the stories of \\"Righteous Gentiles\\" who risked their lives to save the Jews; the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941; and the death camps. He also writes of the fate of slave laborers and those who were forced to participate in what were, literally, death marches; the liberation of the Jews; the war crimes trials from Nuremberg to Eichman.  Interestingly, he addresses questions that are still being asked about the Holocaust today.<br /><br />Included are individual stories, like those of Anne Frank, the children of Izieu and Otto Schindler. Reflections and testimonies of witnesses and survivors illuminate the period as do the extraordinary moving photographs.<br /><br />Martin Gilbert's work provides an eloquent record which, at times, overwhelms us with the truth. Now, more than ever, as the survivors and perpetrators grow old and die, it is paramount to understand and give meaning to the grim record of human destruction. \\"Never Again\\" powerfully counteracts the dehumanizing nature of Nazi extermination. As the statistics \\"represent real people,\\" names are put to faces in photographs and the stories of individuals are told. With the publication of this work Eli Wiesel said, \\"This book must be read and reread. It will be painful to you, but you must read it anyway. To know? No. To understand? No, not that either. But simply to remember all those whom the world, once upon a time, tried to forget.\\"<br /><br />JANAsses questions that are still being asked about the Holocaust today. <br />  <br />Included are individual stories, like those of Anne Frank, the children of Izieu and Otto Schindler.

Many have called him \\"irascible, demanding, bullying, and probably a genius.\\" I can attest to the \\"genius\\" part. As a bassist Mingus has few peers. He elevated his instrument into the front line of a band with his \\"pulsating sense of rhythm and powerful tone.\\" My admiration for him led me to buy the book, \\"Tonight At Noon: A Love Story.\\" The title comes from one of Charlie's best compositions.<br /><br />Sue Mingus, his widow and fourth wife, writes this extraordinary memoir with elegance, passion, and honesty. Their's is an improbable love story, especially given their racial, social, and temperamental differences. He was a brilliant, volatile, eccentric artist, and a product of L.A.'s Watts ghetto. Sue Graham, a Midwestern WASP and debutante, graduated from Smith College, and worked as a journalist in Europe and New York. The two met in 1964. Unlike many memoirs on the market today, this lady has a powerful tale to tell - and she can really write! One of the most moving and fundamental feelings I was left with after concluding this love story, and it is just that, is that Charlie Mingus was so very special, not just as a musician, but as a man.<br /><br />The first part of the memoir covers the period of the couple's courtship and marriage, beginning when they met to the onset of Charlie's illness, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, (ALS), commonly called Lou Gehrig's Disease, in 1977. The latter half deals with his last years, and their terrible battle against his affliction for which there is no cure. Sue cared for him until his untimely death in 1979, at the young age of 56. Physically and emotionally exhausted, Sue traveled to India to scatter his ashes in the Ganges. She says, \\"He had more energy than ninety people running down the block when he was frozen in a wheelchair\\" (commenting on his final days in Cuernavaca, Mexico).<br /><br />Jazz and art were Mingus' wonderful obsessions. He brought Sue into his world with all its exoticism, confusion, exhilaration, hostilities, excesses and unpredictable confrontations. Hers is the story of a loving and tumultuous marriage, and her own personal odyssey inside and outside its confines. Her writing on Mingus' shared thoughts, on many topics, makes for fascinating reading, and provides insight into the mind of this talented, complex man. At one point she writes, \\"He was so worried he might fail to express something on his mind that he was compelled to state it instantly, examine it, get a reaction to it. Sometimes I thought if he failed to express himself to the world around him, he would go out of his mind.\\" Another discerning comment about living with a creative genius and asserting one's own priorities: \\"Artists get away with their ambiguities and immoralities because they leave something behind, maybe not to their own children, but to the world. The rest of us leave our children behind, whose judgment will add to our own.\\"<br /><br />There are several wonderful anecdotes of encounters with Charlie Parker, Sonny Rollins, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Norman Mailer, and some extraordinary anti-drug comments to Timothy Leary: \\"You've got nothing for Harlem, man. Nothing for the workers, the people who go to their jobs, the people who get up at six.\\"<br /><br />\\"Tonight At Noon\\" includes never-before published black and white photographs of Mingus and a special epilogue about the activities Mingus' music has taken on since his death. Sue Mingus is the founder and president of the Charles Mingus Institute and has managed Mingus's music for the past twenty years. She has dedicated herself to keeping his sound alive and thus created the Mingus Big Band, which has made five CDs, the latest is \\"Tonight at Noon,\\" and each year tours about thirty cities in the U.S. and twenty more cities around the world.<br /><br />\\"Tonight At Noon\\" was one of the \\"100 Best Books of the Year,\\" chosen by the Los Angeles Times Magazine, December 8, 2002, and was among the \\"Notable Books of the Year 2002,\\" in the New York Times Book Review, December 8, 2002.

From the adrenalin-charged Prologue, where a sniper takes three shots at the President of the United States, wounding him, and killing his best friend and a secret service agent, Michael Lawson's \\"The Inside Circle\\" provides a roller-coaster ride of a riveting read. This suspense thriller has a tautly written storyline involving political corruption, blatant abuse of government power, cover-ups at the highest levels, murder, incest, and a lurid gothic tale of a megalomaniac who rules his turf with an iron fist.<br /><br />The sign on lawyer Joe DeMarco's office door, reads \\"Counsel Pro Tem For Liaison Affairs, J. DeMarco.\\" The title was the  invention of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, for whom Joe works. His job description reads \\"get it done guy.\\" He is Speaker John Fitzgerald Mahoney's heavy, the man to go to when problems need to \\"be resolved\\" in a manner which cannot be associated with the Congressional offices. When Mahoney orders DeMarco to meet with Homeland Security Secretary Andy Banks, our appealing protagonist learns that Banks received a warning note concerning the assassination attempt days before the event occurred. The note was immediately passed on to Secret Service Director Patrick Donnelly, who obviously did not act on it. Banks asks DeMarco to investigate a secret service agent for possible complicity in the crime. The deeper Joe digs the more suspicious, unsubstantiated \\"non admissible evidence\\" he discovers. And none of the information points to the suspect who supposedly fired the shots - the man who conveniently committed suicide before further investigation could be conducted.<br /><br />DeMarco is a terrific character, and his wit, (the author's really), honesty, resilience, along with the quirky crew he brings into the case to assist him, make the novel more unique than it would be ordinarily. After all, there is usually a glut of well-written political thrillers on the market. Joe's fact finding takes him from Washington, DC, to Georgia's Chattooga River, and finally, to a southern Georgia county which encompasses a big part of the Okefenokee Swamps.

Twentieth century cinema revived interest in these lycanthropes, with films like Michael Landon's \\"I Was A Teenage Werewolf,\\" \\"An American Werewolf In London,\\" and Jack Nicholson's \\"Wolf,\\" among others. Popular fiction has romanticized and/or demonized these mythical creatures who look and act human but turn into wolves at the full moon. Author Dennis Danvers has given readers a new take on this old tale with his novel, \\"Wilderness.\\"<br /><br />Alice White, is an intelligent, exotically attractive woman in her early thirties. She is a loner, and has been since the age of twelve, which is when she first changed into a wolf during the full moon. Unlike fictional accounts of werewolves, Alice's transformation does not endow her with human qualities. She becomes a full-fledged wolf in every way, and never fully remembers her experiences as a wild animal when she changes back into human form. Nor does she recall what it is like to be Alice when she is a wolf, although the wolf is aware of \\"the girl,\\" who is her other self. Her secret governs her existence. She has made it a point not to form close relationships with friends or lovers, although she yearns for normalcy and an end to her isolation and terrible loneliness. She is not as afraid of discovery as she is of hurting someone, due to a violent incident she was once involved in. So, she barricades herself in her basement at the beginning of each lunar cycle.<br /><br />College biology professor Erik Summers is Alice's new neighbor and very much attuned to the natural world and animals. Erik and Alice felt an intense mutual attraction since they first met. The attraction is more than just physical. There is a sense of deep affinity between them. With Eric, Alice breaks her cardinal rule about keeping all contact with men to one night stands. As their relationship grows into love, Alice knows she can no longer live a lie and decides to confide in Eric.<br /><br />Danver's fast-paced, well written narrative explores the concept of a woman coming to grips with her extreme and most unusual dual nature, and her decision about which path she will follow, that of the human or the beast. He also emphasizes Erik's dilemma. Here is a man who loves a woman he believes is his soul-mate, only to be presented with information he finds totally unbelievable. The story is moving, and far removed from the cliche werewolf novel which is so prevalent on the market today. Alice and Erik are well developed and sympathetic characters. This is not a horror novel or a supernatural romance, but a sensitive, original book which deals with human psychology and relationships much more than lycanthropy. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />\\"Wilderness\\" was nominated for both the Locus and Bram Stoker first novel awards.<br /><br />JANAric. <br />  <br />Danver's fast-paced, well written narrative explores the concept of a woman coming to grips with her extreme and most unusual dual nature, and her decision about which path she will follow, that of the human or the beast.

As the book's  title suggests, the novel is about liberty - and not just America's.<br /><br />The plot centers around two women whose backgrounds and lives could not be more dissimilar. Makepeace Hedley is a Yank, a former Boston tavern keeper whom fate chose to turn into an Englishwoman, or as much so as humanly possible. Forced to leave her native land, she married an Englishman, and upon his early demise, married another, Andra Hedley, whom she adores. She is an extremely intelligent, independent, brash, blunt-spoken woman, who in today's world would be called a staunch feminist. She also has the kindest of hearts. Makepeace has always been, first and foremost, a businesswoman. In Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Northumberland, she successfully runs the family shipping company, while Andra is a mining engineer concerned with preventing underground gas explosions. He is presently on a visit to France, investigating the properties of air with chemist Antoine Lavoisier. As the novel opens, the French have just entered the war on the side of the colonials, stranding Andra Hedley across the English Channel, which sends Makepeace in to a frenzy of worry. To make matters worse, she receives a long-delayed letter, informing her that her eleven year-old daughter, who has been visiting friends in America, is on a ship returning to England with her guardian, a dear family friend. The ship, with daughter and companion, should have docked in London months ago and yet no word has been sent to the Hedleys of its arrival. Makepeace and her stepson, upon hearing that the child was taken prisoner by the British after her ship was sunk in a sea battle, set off for London to rescue the girl.<br /><br />Diana, Countess of Stacpoole, has just become the Dowager Countess. She is only thirty-nine and still quite beautiful. Married at fourteen to a sadistic brute of a man, she learned quite soon to hide her emotions behind a veneer of boredom, lest her husband use her feelings against her. She is a woman of honor, a stoic, and strong supporter of the British class system and her place in it as a woman of noble birth. She recognizes that under this system, she is not a free person and has no rights under the law. She is a \\"prisoner of propriety.\\"  Diana's son and his wife have now taken over their hereditary positions, have parsimoniously awarded her a small allowance and asked her to move into the estate's Dowager House. Like Makepeace Hedley, Diana, receives a letter. Her girlhood friend, who has married a colonialist, writes to tell her that her son, a navel officer, has been taken prisoner by the British, and is being held in abominable conditions in Plymouth. The Dowager Countess, determined not to continue to live as a prisoner herself, decides to pay a visit to her friends Lord Admiral and Lady Edgecumbe, who live just outside the port city. Once there, she will investigate the whereabouts and condition of her friend's son.<br /><br />The Dowager Countess and the businesswoman meet and unite forces in friendship and common goals. Together they confront the serious problems of unacceptable prison conditions, slavery, segregation, smuggling, prostitution, along with public scandal, and discover, in the process, how precious their own freedom is.<br /><br />\\"Taking Liberties\\" is an exceptionally good historical novel which, among other things,  illustrates the differences between the new world and the old empire. Although there are romantic elements here, this is much more than a romance. Author Diana Norman has done considerable research on the period and times and her narrative reflects this. Her characters are extremely well developed, and continue to grow due to the situations which confront them. The two women, especially, become much more political as a result of events which touch their lives personally. I found parts of the book to be delightfully humorous. Ms. Norman is a teller of yarns if there ever was one! \\"Taking Liberties\\" is a sequel to the novel \\"A Catch of Consequence\\" about the early life of Makepeace Hedley, nee Burke.

However, while \\"The Cutout\\" stands on its own as a novel, \\"Blown\\" is more a sequel, a Part II, dependent on the prior book for a thorough understanding of the content. Both books are chilling thrillers concerning the Neo-Nazi terrorist organization \\"30 April.\\" \\"Blown\\" continues the saga of tough, talented Caroline Carmichael, CIA intelligence analyst turned operative.<br /><br />Caroline has worked for the last two years for the Counterterrorism Center, (CTC), focusing almost obsessively, on \\"30 April\\" a disciplined group of Eastern European terrorists whose goal is to cleanse Europe of all non-Aryans. This group was responsible for the deadly explosion which killed everyone onboard MedAir Flight 901, including her husband, former deputy director of the CTC, Eric Carmichael. The 30 April Organization's leader, Croatian Mlan Krucevic, was a trained geneticist who used biological agents in human experiments. Just a few days before this novel begins, he and his group kidnapped US Vice President Sophie Payne, while she was on an official visit to Berlin. Krucevic and most of his cohorts were killed during the subsequent search and rescue mission. Unfortunately, so was the American vice president. While reviewing videotape footage of the kidnapping, a select few CTC employees, including Caroline, discover that Eric Carmichael is still alive. His face is visible in the terrorist helicopter which makes-off with Ms. Payne. Scottie Sorensen Chief of CTC and Eric's boss, had secretly recruited him to infiltrate 30 April. Now, after the vice president's unexpected murder, Eric has become a liability to Sorenson, and must be eliminated. Sorenson \\"blows\\" Carmichael's cover.<br /><br />As the novel opens, Daniel Becker, an American citizen and member of a US based 30 April cell, spikes drinking water with deadly poison. He then hands out cups of the doctored water to runners participating in a marathon, with fatal results. Becker disappears and reemerges several hours later to kill the Director of Central Intelligence. Caroline is next on his list. A series of emails are sent to the Washington Post newsroom, warning that retribution is at hand for the death of Krucevic. Invoking the name of Tim McVeigh, as well as Ruby Ridge and Waco, the text says, \\"The End Times are coming. Prepare.\\"<br /><br />Caroline Carmichael, aware of Sorenson's betrayal, understands it is almost impossible to beat the Chief at his game. Without the power or the proof to expose him, she is about to resign from the CIA when she learns of the attack, and the epidemic number of deaths following the marathon. As the major expert on the terrorist organization, she is drawn into the new investigation. Then she hears her husband has been arrested in Germany as a terrorist operative. Not trusting anyone and suspecting everyone, Caroline is helpless as far as assisting Eric to escape and evade his former boss. She must focus on identifying and capturing the members of the domestic terrorist cell.<br /><br />Francine Mathews, is a former CIA analyst who brings her expertise to the suspenseful narrative, making her characters and scenarios quite credible and giving a behind-the-scenes look at our intelligence community. However, I really question whether this novel can stand on its own. The storyline and sub-plots are quite dependent on \\"The Cutout\\" for an enormous amount of information not provided here. Segments concerning Eric Carmichael, his activities with 30 April, the kidnapping and death of Vice President Payne, Scottie Sorenson's rogue behavior, and almost everything which refers to Krucevic's son, Jozsef, are given scant attention here, yet these absent elements are so critical to enjoying and understanding \\"Blown.\\" I have to qualify and say that although this is an excellent political action thriller, (I enjoyed it immensely), it is only so in combination with Ms. Mathews' prior novel. I do recommend reading them both together.<br /><br />JANAmensely), it is only so in combination with Ms. Mathews' prior novel. I do recommend reading them both together. <br />JANA	2005-06-03

How can a book with a totally contrived plot, and one-dimensional characters who lack credibility, be a successful, and somewhat riveting page turner? And how could I, aware of this from page 28, keep reading with avid interest? There's just no accounting for my lack of good taste!<br /><br />Years ago, author Miles Van Meter wrote a best seller, \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" about a serial killer who committed depraved crimes against his family and others in his community. With the recent apprehension of the murderer, and new case evidence, Van Meter has just released an updated version of the book with additional chapters. Margolin's novel opens with the author on a book tour. After giving a reading at a bookstore, he agrees to answer questions from the audience. In a series of flashbacks the bizarre events described in his book are revealed.<br /><br />Sixteen year-old Ashley Spenser, is a top student in high school, a natural leader and a star soccer player on her varsity team. She invites her best friend, another team member, to spend the night to celebrate that day's winning game, which will give them a shot at the State Cup. In the early morning hours, a masked man enters the Spenser home, brutally stabs Ashley's father, rapes, tortures, and murders her friend, terrorizes Ashley and leaves her tied-up and helpless, while he goes into the family's kitchen and makes himself a snack before returning to kill the teenager. Norman Spenser, bleeding to death, crawls into his daughters bedroom and helps free her, using a Swiss Army knife. The girl escapes through the bedroom window and runs to a neighbor's house to get help. Mrs. Spenser, who has been away on a business trip, returns to find her husband dead, her daughter terribly traumatized and her own life altered forever. What follows is the inevitable search and arrest of the killer, but not before he murders and maims once again, and makes another attempt on Ashley's life. There are numerous twists and turns in the storyline, plus various subplots which I don't want to disclose and spoil the book for potential readers.<br /><br />The narrative kept me turning pages, although much that I read was pure and simple bad writing. When an author, in order to further his plot, sacrifices believability, I rapidly lose respect. Ashley, only a month or two after the murders, is seriously depressed and grieving. She has not returned to school, but her principal has decided to allow her to finish the year without going back into the classroom. Yet, her mother moved right back into the house where the tragic events occurred, has not insisted that her daughter get help, and is frustrated that the girl is mourning and not bouncing back, when she used to be so resilient. Give me a break! She encourages her daughter to accept a scholarship to an exclusive academy and live away from home, just 2-3 months after the crime, without getting any counseling at all. I find her reactions and lack of patience difficult to believe. She also shows no sign of mourning, herself. Then, after another attempt is made on the poor kid's life, she is left alone in a totally deserted dorm over the holidays (??), with just 2 cops guarding the building - one by her room and another on the grounds. Again, this young girl has just experienced severe violence and witnessed heinous murders, including her father's, and she is by herself in a huge dormitory facility??? Puleeze!<br /><br />As I wrote before, I was left incredulous by many of the plot's implausible leaps. Character development is almost nil. The writing is formulaic and often repetitive. Yet, I will give this to Mr. Margolin, he has the knack of keeping readers hanging in there. I don't understand how he holds the readers' interest, mine included, when there are so many thrillers of this type on the market which are of a much higher quality. I feel obligated to give him an Average of 3 Stars on this, however, because I certainly read through until the end.<br />JANA	2005-05-31

Susan Gibbs' debut novel, \\"The Bend In The River\\" is set on the still unsettled prairies of post-Civil War America, and in the Washington Territory. This is more an epic historical western, the saga of a young woman's most unusual experiences living on the Great Plains, than it is a typical romance. The author's simple, straightforward prose, and realistic dialogue lend authenticity to this unique tale of the early West.<br /><br />Shea Hawkshadow, a half-breed Cheyenne warrior, finds a young woman, near frozen to death during a freak early autumn blizzard. Seventeen year-old Emma Jordan had just finished burying her parents near the family's sod house, and was on a twenty mile walk to the nearest trading post, when she was overtaken by the snow and freezing temperatures. When Emma regains consciousness, she is at the Cheyenne Agency, Shea's home, in the capable care off Red Leaf Woman, a widow. Emma is treated well, and though she makes a few unsuccessful attempts to escape the reservation, she finally acquiesces to spend the winter there. She begins to learn the language and customs of these Native Americans, and in turn teaches some of the men to read and write English. Because of Hawkshadow's mixed-blood heritage, he is rejected as a potential husband by the tribe's women, although he has a proven record as a brave Cheyenne Dog Soldier and hunter. He and Emma have much in common, and their mutual attraction is more than just her neediness as a new found orphan, and his as a lone brave with little hope of marriage. The two fall in love and marry despite the strong prejudices which exist at this time about \\"mixed-race couples,\\" especially when one member of the pair is a white woman. They dream of living a \\"normal\\" life amongst the Cheyenne.<br /><br />When the tribe is threatened with yet another relocation, tribal leaders decide to ask Red Cloud's Sioux for help, and to flee north, back to their lands along the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers. The fall of 1978 marks the Cheyenne Outbreak.Two hundred and eighty-four men, women and children undertake a clandestine and brutal 1500 mile march, which lasts for more than five months.

It is also a remarkably well researched story of the American West.<br /><br />There are actually two interrelated novels here, with an unofficial demarcation line between them. The book's second part is about life in Washington Territory, eventually Washington State. Emma and Shea move to this region looking, still, to make a home for themselves where they will either be accepted or left in peace. The hatred and persecution they endure is terrible. Emma, Shea, and their complex relationship are beautifully brought to life by the author. In fact, I would say that one of Ms. Gibbs' strengths is character development. All of hers are remarkably three dimensional. This section of the novel also deals with the emotional manifestation of the many problems Emma has experienced over the years. She has a nervous breakdown, and the process of her healing reveals many interesting details from her past.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Bend In The River,\\" although I would have definitely preferred the tale to be told in two separate novels.

Set in southwest Georgia during the 1940's, 50's, and 60's, \\"In The Dark Of The Moon\\" is the story of a woman's grace and her madness, a child's quest, and a family's secrets. It is also a tale of revenge. Underlying all, however, is the brutal racism endemic to the Deep South during that period, and the hope of change brought by the burgeoning civil rights movement.<br /><br />Emmitt Till, a fourteen year-old black boy from Chicago was visiting relatives in Mississippi during the summer of 1955. He was shot in the head, after being brutally beaten, for allegedly whistling at a white woman. Elizabeth Lacey killed herself that same summer, unable to bear the pain caused by the myriad of cruel images which flooded her mind. She left behind her precocious five year-old daughter, Kansas.<br /><br />Elizabeth, bold and honest, as she had vowed to be when just a young girl, had long been the \\"family emergency\\" no one wanted to confront head-on. The \\"broth of the family's bloodlines,\\" tinged with insanity, had threatened to boil over since her adolescence, when her gaiety became fevered and her sadness profound. Her mind, camera-like, would take snapshots, moments frozen in time, and file them away for later viewing. Elizabeth was unable to protect herself from the \\"bad images of the world:\\" the death of FDR, who once waved and smiled at the three year-old little girl from a passing car; photographs of concentration camp victims; Hiroshima and Nagasaki; a devastating betrayal which occurred on the night of her first high school dance; the violent lynching of an innocent black man she had unwittingly caused; the heinous murder of Emmitt Till which brought back all the pain.<br /><br />Kansas Lacey, now twelve, has been raised by her extended family: her grandparents, the emotionally fragile and very distant, Miss Pearl, and Daddy Jack, the Sheriff of Sumner; Miss Lucille, called Grandemona, her great-grandmother; Aunt Francis, always Elizabeth's confidant, who now wants to take on that same role for Kansas; the beloved Pinky, a black woman who had cared for Elizabeth when she was too ill to function, and then became a mother figure to the child, after her mother's suicide. The Lacey's, a dysfunctional bunch of folks, were unable to honestly answer the precocious child's endless questions about her parents and the past. They thrived on half-truths, euphemisms and omissions. As Kansas grew older, she was left to learn by the impressions she garnered and her own sleuth work, the results of which she kept locked away in her diary. She is not the only one working to bring the facts surrounding Elizabeth Lacey's death into the open. By Kansas' thirteenth year, all the evil and violence which had been hidden and repressed about the prominent Lacey family of Sumner Georgia, will come to light, and the daughter will finally learn that her mother \\"was solid and brave, in spite of the unwinding spiral of her mind and the poise of a pistol barrel at her temple.\\"<br /><br />Suzanne Hudson has created unforgettably powerful characters, whose voices will remain with the reader long after they complete \\"In The Dark Of The Moon.\\" The author is from a small town in southwest Georgia, where her grandfather, and great-grandfather before him, were county sheriffs. Her insight into the psychological and social make-up of life in the South is made even more credible because of her personal background and experience. The narrative is fast paced, taut and incredibly moving at times. The plot and subplots are riveting - I was unable to put the novel down. And Ms. Hudson's descriptions, bring the southern landscape to life, especially that of her much loved Lake Blackshear. Her depiction of the dark side of the Velvet Corridor is chilling. I highly recommend this extraordinary novel, compelling fiction from a most talented writer.<br /><br />JANAwants to take on that same role for Kansas; the beloved Pinky, a black woman who had cared for Elizabeth when she was too ill to function, and then became a mother figure to the child, after her mother's suicide.

Nicole Krauss' \\"History Of Love\\" is one of the most poignant and beautiful novels I have read in many moons - dare I say years? I do not exaggerate. Her prose is pure poetry, and her writing is a wonderful example of literature as an art form. Although this is not a Holocaust novel, per se, the Shoah casts a long shadow over the narrative. I think the book is much more a remembrance of those who died, a memorial of sorts, than a book about death. Actually, the themes here are love, survival and loss. I shed many a tear while reading, sometimes because of the author's exquisite use of language, and others because of a character's terrible sadness, but I found myself bursting into laughter more often than not at the wonderful humor. Some of the dialogue is especially witty. Oddly, I was reminded of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's work. Perhaps the sense of wonder Ms. Krauss conveys, along with elements of fantasy which intertwine with reality, form a kind of magical realism.<br /><br />\\"The first woman may have been Eve, but the first girl will always be Alma.\\" So wrote young, aspiring author Leopold Gursky. He actually wrote three books before he was twenty-one, before WWII invaded his hometown of Slonim, which was located \\"sometimes in Poland, and others in Russia.\\" Now, years later in Brooklyn, NY, Leo has no idea what happened to his manuscript, \\"The History Of Love,\\" his most important work. He wrote the novel about the only thing he knew, his love for Alma. \\"Once upon a time there was a boy and a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering.\\" He continued to write their story long after Alma's father sent her to America, where she would be safe from the Nazis. He even wrote after the Germans pushed East, toward his home.<br /><br />At age eighty, Leo feels compelled to make himself seen at least once a day. He fears dying alone in his apartment, on a day when no one sees him at all. And he is capable of doing some pretty outrageous things to garner attention, including posing in the nude for a life drawing class. Ever since the war he has felt invisible. He survived by becoming invisible. And now, he needs to be sure he exists. When he came to America, his cousin, a locksmith took him in and taught him the trade. He did so because he knew Leo could not remain invisible forever. \\"Show me a Jew that survives and I'll show you a magician,\\" he used to say. Leo finds some solace in his work. \\"In my loneliness it comforts me to think that the world's doors, however closed, are never truly locked to me.\\" Unbeknownst, to Leopold Gursky, his book has survived also, and has inspired others in many ways, especially to love.<br /><br />Alma Singer is a precocious teenager who lives in New York City. She is named for all the female characters in her father's favorite book, \\"A History of Love.\\" Singer, an Israeli, bought the only copy in a store in Buenos Aires, while traveling in South America. Alma's mother, Charlotte, is an Englishwoman who met her husband while working on a kibbutz in Israel. He gave her the book, a gift, when he realized how much he cared for her. He died of pancreatic cancer when Alma was seven. Seven years later, his family is still adjusting to their loss. The sensitive girl desperately wants to ease her mother's loneliness. She also wants to learn how to survive in the wilderness, and help her brother, Bird, be a normal boy. Bird believes he may be the Messiah. Charlotte, a translator, receives a request from an anonymous stranger to translate an obscure book by a Polish exile, Zvi Litvinoff, who immigrated to Chile. She accepts the commission. The book, written in Spanish, is titled \\"The History of Love.\\" Alma reads her mom's English translation and sets out to find her namesake. Her literary detective work is hilarious and her tenacity is admirable.<br /><br />Ms. Krauss is a master at linking her various storylines seamlessly. Her characters are a delight - all vivid and memorable for their humanity, their eccentricity, and their inner strength. The author brings them to life on the page. They have all experienced sorrow and loss, yet there is not a self-pitying voice among them. And it is impossible not to love Leo Gursky. I hear my grandmother's voice, at times, when he speaks. She died years ago, and was probably a generation older than the author's grandparents, to whom the novel is dedicated.<br /><br />I plan to reread \\"The History of Love\\" in a few weeks, over a weekend when I won't be disturbed.

I never even heard of Betty Smith's classic novel \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,\\" let alone read it. And I was an avid reader who lived relatively close to Brooklyn. Whatever the reason for this significant omission in my early literary development, I remedied the situation recently, (yes, it took me a while). I can only echo here what millions of other readers have said since the book's publication in 1943, this is an extraordinary novel which enriches and delights. I can understand why The New York Public Library chose it as one of the \\"Books of the Century.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Smith grew up in Brooklyn and drew from her own experiences to portray the hardships of the Nolans, a tenement family living in that borough's Williamsburg slums during the early part of the 20th century. Teenage Francie Nolan is an avid reader who wants to become a writer. She adores her father John, an alcoholic with a multitude of pipe dreams. He, in turn, loves his children and tries to be a good father, but he is not able to carry out his responsibilities. Nolan has become a dissipated man due to his alcohol addiction. Francie believes in him regardless, (and she's the only one), because they're soul-mates. Although it seems contradictory, the girl also possesses a strong practical streak. Her mother, Katie, abandoned all illusions for a better life long ago. She is rendered almost emotionless by a surfeit of her husband's grand schemes. However she stresses to her children that education is the only path out of the tenements. Grandma Rommely, Katie's mother, also reinforces the importance of education.<br /><br />There is a single ordinary tree visible from the Nolan's tenement window. It grows doggedly through the cement, in spite of harsh conditions which thwart it's development. Yet, it perseveres. For Francie and her father the tree symbolizes hope - the blossoming of life against all odds. It is like a beacon of of light in the darkness of their daily lives. Francie has the tenacity of that tree, and remains steadfast to her dreams. Unlike her father, she has the inner strength and resourcefulness to make them come true.<br /><br />The author poignantly depicts the Nolan's struggles to survive and grow in a world of poverty, hunger, class prejudice and tremendous loss. Francie, a courageous girl, of strong character, comes of age here under extremely difficult circumstances. The portrait of her family members and her relationship with them is beautifully drawn, especially her relationship with her brother Neely. And turn-of-the-century Williamsburg is brought vividly to life. Broader topics are also introduced which enhance the narrative tremendously, such as, WWI, immigration, and politics of the period. Smith's characters are strong and well developed. She uses flashbacks to tell the fascinating story of John Nolan's courtship of Katie, their marriage and early years together.<br /><br />\\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\" is a heartfelt, moving novel which touched me deeply. Betty Smith's prose is powerful, as are her storyline and characters. This is a book I will keep to reread in the future. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br />JANArancie has the tenacity of that tree, and remains steadfast to her dreams.

As she begins a controversial speech to crowds gathered near the US Embassy in Berlin, a terrorist attack is launched. A bomb goes off in front of the Brandenburg Gate, killing and wounding many, including Ms. Payne's bodyguard. In the midst of the ensuing chaos, a helicopter lands, terrorists grab the vice president and make an effortless get-away. Later, as the CIA director and her associates review the videotape of the kidnapping, they recognize the face of the pilot and are stunned into silence. And these folks, who have seen and heard just about everything, are not easily shocked.<br /><br />Caroline Carmichael is a CIA intelligence analyst specializing in European terrorist groups. Her husband, Eric, former CIA operative and European station chief, had been killed two years before when the plane he was on exploded over the Aegean Sea. Since then, all Caroline's work for the Counterterrorism Center, (CTC), has focused on one disciplined, deadly group of Eastern European killers, the \\"30 April Organization.\\" Their agenda is to cleanse Europe of all non-Aryans and their MO is terror. Croatian Mlan Krucevic, is the organization's leader. He is a trained geneticist who uses biological agents in human experiments. A fanatic, like his father before him, he is a former director of prison camps in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and responsible for the murder and torture of thousands of Muslims and Serbs. His file reads like sadistic horror fiction. It was Krucevic who had a bomb placed on MedAir 901, Eric Carmichael's fatal flight. The 30 April Organization, under Krucevic's command, is also responsible for kidnapping Sophie Payne.<br /><br />Caroline's expertise on everything pertaining to 30 April, its history, methods, motives and the psychology of its members, leads to her active involvement in the plan to rescue the Vice President. However, as the complex plot unwinds, and Central European governments begin to crumble, the reader discovers that much more than the life of a high ranking US official is at stake.<br /><br />\\"The Cutout\\" is an outstanding novel of espionage and international politics - chillingly realistic, especially given Francine Mathews' personal knowledge of her subject. She is a former CIA analyst. Her descriptions of the intelligence community are fascinating and credible, as is her tour through the killing fields of Bosnia, and the glimpses she provides of the savage results of religious and ethnic hatreds which have existed in this region for centuries.<br /><br />\\"Cutout\\" is an Intelligence term for a go-between, a pawn. I found \\"The Cutout\\" to be more than just an intelligent action thriller and a riveting read. Ms. Mathews' presents a fascinating political scenario, where a German chancellor is assassinated. His replacement is a representative from Germany's Social Conservative Party, with a hidden agenda to annex Central Europe, and the means to do it. This overriding plot is gripping, as is the kidnapping of the US Vice President. The author masterfully juggles and merges various storylines. Her characters are strong and well developed. \\"The Cutout\\" also brings into play a moral topic which has been discussed widely, especially since 9/11. It's that old Machiavellian, \\"Does the end justify the means?\\" How far should our Intelligence operatives go, whether in dealing with evil, (working with people like Saddam Hussein, or former Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega), or in perpetrating it themselves, (i.e., as inside agents, performing terrorists acts themselves, so as not to blow their cover), in order to wipe-out the larger evil? \\"The Cutout\\" makes for a compelling read and I highly recommend it.

L. B. Matekoni, (the best mechanic in Botswana), foster mother of two lively children, homeowner, and a most respected member of the community.<br /><br />Her life is not free of care, however. There are problems with her adopted son, a date has yet to be set for her wedding, and friend and colleague Grace Makutsi is having trouble finding a husband. Savvy assistant detective Makutsi, who has picked-up  business acumen from her boss, opens the \\"Kalahari Typing School For Men,\\" with a little help from her friends. This special all male school is necessary, as the guys are ashamed to sit in class with women. When Mma Makutsi is not busy looking for suitors, she is searching for potential students.<br /><br />And across town there is new found competition for the Ladies' Detective Agency - always No. 1 in my book. Until recently, Precious Ramotswe  had the only PI office in Gaborone. However, the \\"Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency\\" has just opened its doors and is ready for business. Arrogant, aggressive Cephas Buthelezi, the owner, a retired NYC cop, and a male chauvinist if there ever was one, is a master at fighting dirty. He has reopened the issue about a woman's place in the sleuth business...and is making inroads with the local clientele. He advises potential customers to, \\"Entrust your enquiries to a MAN!\\" Needless to say, the financial problems which have longed plagued Mma Ramotswe, significantly increase with the competition.<br /><br />New cases include, a well-to-do engineer from Lobatse, who hires Mma Ramotswe to assist him in righting the wrongs he committed in the past. And, a potentially philandering husband is investigated with disturbing results.<br /><br />Author Alexander McCall Smith's series is so outstanding because of his phenomenal characters, although the storylines are fascinating, and his elegant but simple writing style makes reading enjoyable. Precious Ramotswe is a jewel - an absolute original. Extremely intelligent, with outstanding intuitive capabilities, she possesses a keen perception of the human character. Along with perseverance, and a strong set of values, Mma Ramotswe inspires trust in most all who meet her. She is also good woman with a kind heart. Most inspiring is her deep and abiding love for Africa, and for Botswana and its people in particular. \\"They are my people, my brothers and sisters.

I felt compelled to read \\"The Friend Who Got Away: Twenty Women's True Life Tales of Friendships that Blew Up, Burned Out or Faded Away\\" because I am a woman who once lost a best friend, and for some reason let her \\"get away.\\" I have long felt a profound sense of sadness for the tremendous loss - the loss of so much closeness, the mutual trust, and the extraordinary intimacy of being able to confide almost anything in another person. In my lifetime, I have experienced the end of many relationships, some for expediency, others because paths diverged, and some, even for the best. Yet I will never forget this special women and all the wonderful conversations, thoughts and dreams we once shared - and now do not. Those who believe, in general, that romantic relationships are more intense than platonic friendships are in for a surprise. As I read the twenty essays included in this gem of a collection, some of them wonderful, others not, I was amazed at how many resonated with me and reminded me of various and diverse relationships I have had with women over the years. I was struck by the complexity of these friendships, and the variety of reasons they ended.<br /><br />One friendship broke-up over a loan. Another, because men, sex and dates took priority over women friends. Others ended because of intellectual differences, competition, ambition, and betrayal. A few stories are devastating in nature, one involves the loss of a child. Authors Heather Abel and Emily Chenoweth discuss their mutual college friendship, and its demise, in separate essays. \\"I've never had a friendship that was that intense,\\" Chenoweth said in a recent interview. \\"It did make it volatile in the way that a love relationship can be. But the thing is, lovers have a vocabulary for talking about the relationship. I'm not sure that exists for friends.\\" Now, at age 33, both have reconciled.<br /><br />Contributors Heather Abel, Diana Abu Jaber, Dorothy Allison, Nuar Alsadir, Kate Bernheimer, Emily Chenoweth, Jennifer Gilmore, Beverly Gologorsky, Vivian Gornick, Ann Hood, Nicole Keeter, Patricia Marx, Lydia Millet, Mary Morris, Francine Prose, Katie Roiphe, Helen Schulman, Elizabeth Strout, Emily White, share their well written, unique stories with the reader, which will inevitably evoke a multitude of feelings.

This senior is as smart as he is sexy - and he is sexy, trust me! He made his debut in James Swain's \\"Grift Sense.\\" \\"Funny Money,\\" book two in the series, has our hero back home in Atlantic City....for a funeral, unfortunately. Doyle Flannigan, Tony's best friend and former partner was murdered, literally blown away, while investigating a casino scam.<br /><br />Right before his death, Doyle phoned Tony at his home in Florida to discuss a $6 million dollar con he was investigating at the Bombay Casino in Atlantic City. The Bombay is owned by their longtime acquaintance Archie Tanner, one of the richest men in NJ, and a \\"mean, foul-mouthed thug.\\" No one likes this guy, including his employees. In the middle of their telephone conversation, a bomb explodes, causing Doyle's demise. Tony hears it all, courtesy of AT&T. Needless to say, our man is out for blood - Bigtime! He's hops a plane, pointed north, to attend the funeral, comfort Liddy, Doyle's wife, and bring Valentine-style justice to those who killed his best buddy. He also plans to hunt down the hustlers who are ripping-off the Bombay. To further complicate his life, black sheep son Gerry, a bookie who manipulated his father into setting him up in business, is being pursued by the Mob.

Julie Garwood has long been one of my favorite romance authors, at least she was up until a few years ago. I love every single one of her historical romances, they're all keepers - but I have been consistently disappointed in her relatively recent venture into the contemporary romance thriller genre. I enjoy suspense thrillers by authors like Karen Robards, Tami Hoag, Suzanne Brockmann, Elizabeth Lowell, Linda Howard, etc.. However, this area is not Ms. Garwood's forte. Unfortunately, \\"The Murder List\\" is a dud, similar in nature to both \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Mercy,\\" but without their strong points.<br /><br />Heiress and philanthropist Regan Hamilton Madison is persuaded by her best friends Sophie and Cordie to become involved in their amateur investigation of a con-man, who runs popular self-help seminars. The two are convinced he murdered a gullible milionairess for her money. The three women attend one of his receptions and participate in a \\"cleansing exercise\\" geared to rid them of their anger. Participants are asked to make a list of people they really don't like and wish would disappear - folks they wish they could murder. Unbelievable?! Regan is shocked but plays along. They are then asked to burn their lists, which is symbolically supposed to cleanse them of negative feelings. Unfortunately, Regan is unable to burn hers, because her cell phone rings and she walks outside to answer it. After the event, she leaves the conference center and is attacked by a strange man on the way to her car. She drops her phone, the intact list, and fortunately escapes with her life. Soon afterward, the first person on her list dies, an apparent suicide. Then another one has a fatal heart attack. When Regan goes to the police to report the attack, as well as her perceived connection to the murders/deaths, Detective Alec Buchanan is assigned to be her bodyguard.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot contains little that is original, worthwhile, or interesting. The characters are cardboard caricatures. Not one of them is developed sufficiently to come across as believable. The heroine is just too naive - too cutesy, to be as intelligent and creative as the author would have us believe. Regan and her two friends are supposedly, experienced, responsible professional women, sophisticated adults. They act like adolescents with little savvy, scatterbrained versions of Nancy Drew. However, they are perfect physical specimens of femininity - gorgeous faces, figures, AND designer wardrobes. Men find them irresistible, but none have ever been in a successful relationship. Of course, the hero is handsome, sexy, intelligent, ambitious, loyal, tender but slightly macho...and single!!! Do you doubt? The villains are not particularly scary! And the dialogue, especially between girlfriends, is inane, to say the least.<br /><br />As with literary fiction, I have high standards for the romance novels and beach books I choose to read. And why not? There's lots of compelling, well written escapist literature on the market, with new books appearing all the time. I look for storylines which are original and complex, with fresh, fully developed characters, and a taut narrative - lots of suspense too. \\"The Murder List\\" just doesn't make the grade. Again, I am not happy about writing this review, as Ms. Garwood has brought me many hours of reading pleasure. I hope she gets back in the swing soon.<br /><br />Janaare cardboard caricatures.

The technology, including a finely tuned magnetometer, had been installed by a firm in Tel Aviv. Since many Austrians vehemently wished the organization did not exist, a letter of introduction was necessary in order to enter the offices, and thorough searches were conducted after appointments were granted. The elderly Eli Lavon worked there and was responsible for interviewing Holocaust survivors, and their descendents, who sought restitution for property and valuables stolen by the Nazis. When a bomb blew up inside the front office, killing two young women and severely wounding Lavon, Ari Shamron, the \\"Memuneh,\\" and former head of Israel's Mossad, knew he had to call in master spy, Gabriel Allon, to work the case.<br /><br />Allon, who goes by the name of Mario Delvecchio, is one of the world's most brilliant art restorers. He is working on a Bellini altarpiece in Venice when Shamron notifies him of the explosion which critically injured his old friend, Eli. Although personally adverse to returning to the city where another act of violence claimed his wife and son years before, Allon travels to Vienna immediately to investigate the crime. A former Auschwitz inmate, Max Klein, contacts Gabriel right after his arrival, and tells him a bizarre story about his unintentional involvement in the explosion. Klein, who had been forced to play the violin in Auschwitz's infamous death orchestra, is murdered, but not before he imparts critically important clues.<br /><br />Klein's information takes Allon to a Viennese cafe where he sees a man whose face he vaguely recalls. Then he discovers a photograph which triggers nightmarish memories. Unknowingly, Gabriel Allon become involved in events which are to take a tremendous emotional toll, and will lead him across Europe, to South America, and back in time to WWII. He will learn details of his deceased mother's internment in Birkenau Concentration Camp, events she had never been able to discuss with him, and also about the infamous Death March she barely survived. For the first time he will read Irene Allon's testimony at Yad Vashem, the Israeli center for Holocaust research and documentation. His mother's past, billions of stolen dollars in a Swiss bank account, and multiple conspiracies which still protect a sadistic mass murderer are linked. At the center of all the clandestine activity is the future chancellor of Austria and a plan to revive Fascism.<br /><br />I think \\"A Death In Venice\\" is Daniel Silva's best book in his trilogy about the Holocaust. Although the last of the series, this novel stands well on its own, and the reader does not need any prior background to become thoroughly immersed in this historical thriller. The story takes on more chilling relevance when it is coupled with current Austrian politics. Gabriel Allon is a wonderful character. He has the soul and sensitivity of an artist, yet has had to repress so much of his self in order to serve his country. And he has made supreme sacrifices, including the lives of those he loved most. Now, when it appears he might finally have another shot at a meaningful life, he is called out of retirement, yet again, because of a scheme with consequences too politically devastating to contemplate, and because of a compelling need to seek justice.

Many years ago I read Gabriel Garcia Marquez' novel, \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" for the first time. I was entranced by the tale of Macondo and its populace, the poetic elegance of the language, and the author's ability to turn the written page into a magic carpet. I was living in Latin America back then and just beginning to speak Spanish, so I read the novel in English. I didn't really credit the translator's work very much, sad to say. I was young. What did I know? However, the narrative was, and is, written in such an exquisite manner that I took note of the translator's name, Gregory Rabassa. A few years later, still living south of the border, my ability to speak the language had improved significantly - for which I am thankful! I reread Marquez' masterpiece, this time in Spanish, and remembering the English version I was struck at the accuracy of Mr. Rabassa's translation. Not only had he interpreted the author's text from Spanish into English with exactitude, (the words, their meaning, correct grammar, syntax, and idioms), he brilliantly communicated the culture of coastal Colombia, the author's writing style, in fact, his very voice. Most extraordinarily, however, he was able to capture the lilt, lyricism, and love of language. This ability to transcend linguistic and cultural borders, proves Gregory Rabassa is a gifted writer and poet in his own right. I'm a big fan!<br /><br />I cannot think of another who has had such an impact on Latin American literature. Through him English-speakers, worldwide, have been able to appreciate the works of such notable authors as: Octavio Paz, Miguel Angel Asturias, Julio Cort&aacute;zar, Mario Vargas Llosa, Jorge Amado, Ant&ouml;nio Lobo Antunes, and, of course, Gabriel Garcia Marquez.<br /><br />When I discovered that Mr. Rabassa had written a memoir, \\"If This Be Treason: Translation And Its Dyscontents-A Memoir,\\" I couldn't wait to read it. I have done so, and enjoyed every page. Not only does he discuss his own fascinating life, he writes about so many talented authors, whose books I have loved, and his collaboration with them. His writing style is conversational, witty, and provocative in its honesty. One feels as if seated at the table with him, over a good cup of coffee or a bottle of wine, listening to tales of the people, anecdotes and incidents which have been so important in his life.<br /><br />Also included are essays on the writers he has worked with and the books he has brought into English. These memoirs make for an excellent read - especially for those who have loved the novels Gregory Rabassa has translated.

This is a quirky tale of people whose lives are in flux, and who are able to handle their changed status creatively. The essential element, common to all, is a strong sense of self on which to fall back. These characters are survivors.<br /><br />Dawn Mackenzie and her nine year-old daughter, Jewel, have moved into a new house, \\"painted an awkward blue of a Mexican bakery with straggling bougainvillea that arches over the front door.\\" The best feature is the deck which looks over the rooftops to the San Francisco Bay. Dawn chose this particular house because it has a downstairs studio apartment she can rent out to help with expenses. The back yard is in shambles but she has plans to begin a garden with Jewel, who wants her own scent garden, \\"In case one of us goes blind.\\" The child is delightfully morbid throughout.<br /><br />Dawn and Jewel had lived with David, their boyfriend/father figure, for five years. An overpowering, larger than life man, he began to stifle Dawn until she really needed her own space to thrive. She and her daughter are adjusting to the newness of living on their own, after the comparative luxury of David's place, and his home cooking. Ironically, Dawn works as an exterminator, by day, killing vermin. At night, however, she draws them. She was trained in technical drawing and aspires to become a full time illustrator of insects. One of her new projects is to put together a portfolio.<br /><br />Harlan, a documentary filmmaker, responds to Dawn Mackenzie's \\"Apartment for Rent\\" notice. He becomes the new tenant, occupying the studio space and sharing a common roof. Harlan had been happily married for years, but his wife's obsession with having a child, to the detriment of all else, distanced the two considerably. On a night out, Harlan picked up Sophia at a club. She is a beautiful exotic dancer. He thinks he's in love. Oh, how a little lust can affect one's thought processes! After confessing all to spouse, Macie, she threw him out. Thus the need for new digs.<br /><br />Over a period, Dawn, Jewel, and Harlan become good friends. When Dawn cannot sleep at night, she goes out to work in her garden in the dark. Harlan often comes to help out and keep her company. The garden becomes a special sanctuary for all of them. Harlan's business partner enters the picture when he becomes smitten with Dawn.<br /><br />Ms. Holm writes a straightforward, fluid narrative, although the pace is slow at times. Her characters are credible and she juggles various storylines with ease. Although she makes some perceptive observations about the nature of love and lust, decision making and the inevitable consequences, the plot is somewhat predictable.

The lives of these gifted and creative siblings can easily compete in drama, and intensity, with those of the characters in their gothic novels. Raised on the bleak Pennine moors of West Yorkshire, their home at Haworth Parsonage could be the setting for \\"Jane Eyre,\\" \\"Wuthering Heights\\" or \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.\\" Indeed, their beloved moors had much to do with the formation of their very characters. In beautiful weather, the dun and purple heathered countryside, with its vast spaces, is beautiful and dramatic. However, this is a place where the sun rarely shines, and there is a dark, brooding, almost sinister quality about the landscape. The almost total silence is occasionally broken by the song of the skylark or the call of the curlew. This solitary, raw, harsher beauty is spectacular in it own way, and has inspired many artists and writers. It is a setting that Emily never wanted to leave. In fact it grieved her so much to be elsewhere, that she was not able to complete her studies away from home. She would walk the countryside in all weather, with her dogs, and seemed to find sustenance there.<br /><br />Their's is a tragic story, so many lives and so much talent snuffed out so soon. Branwell, aged 31, Emily, 30, and Anne, 29. died within a year of each other. One can only imagine Charlotte's grief at being the last living child of Patrick and Maria Branwell Bronte. They were all frail, fey children, who tended to be extremely introverted, although vivacious and exuberant amongst themselves. The four spent much of their childhood and adolescence creating plays, writing epic poems and stories about fantasy worlds which seemed more real to them, at times, than everyday life.<br /><br />Their mother died when Anne was just a baby and her sister, a harsh disciplinarian, came North to live and raise the six children. I can see something of this woman's character in Aunt Reed of \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Maria, and Elizabeth, the oldest daughters, were sent away to school at the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge. A poor parson, Mr. Bronte thought the inexpensive school for girls was a Godsend. In fact, it was a miserable institute where the girls endured unbelievable privations. Maria died of tuberculosis as a result of her stay there, as did Elizabeth, a short time later.<br /><br />Author Lynne Reid Banks, (\\"The L-Shaped Room\\"), paints an intimate and fascinating portrait of the remaining siblings, \\"The Dark Quartet.\\" Much of their dialogue is taken from letters, which adds to the novel's richness and realism. The three young women were all published writers, and supported their family as such, using the noms de plume Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. They wrote prolifically throughout their lifetimes. Their heroines were uniquely strong-willed and independent, unusual in an age when the law and society defined a married woman as a husband's property. Women were totally dependant upon their mates, or fathers, during this period, and could actually be locked away in asylums at a man's whim and convenience. Their heroes were inclined to be intense, brooding, often cruel - perhaps modeled after Branwell. The Bronte sisters were not afraid to write about violence, nor coarse, unacceptable behavior. Again, this candid, direct approach to literature was unusual, especially from female authors. Unfortunately, Branwell did not fare as well as his sisters. Indulged as a boy because of seizures and/or tantrums, he did show great promise as a writer and painter. However, his unfortunate life was cut short by dissipation due to drinking, drugs and severe depression.<br /><br />I became interested in the biography of the Bronte's after reading Anne's \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall.\\" Although I have long been a fan of Charlotte's and Emily's, I had no idea that there was a third such talent in the family. It amazes me that these threevery young women, homebodies all, were able to probe the human drama so deeply, and with such sympathy.<br />JANAes all, were able to probe the human drama so deeply, and with such sympathy.

French mathematician Simon-Pierre Laplace published \\"Analytical Theories of Probabilities\\" in 1812. Author Adam Fawer defines \\"probability theory\\" as the \\"study of so-called chance events, like flipping a coin or throwing dice.\\" He goes on to explain that, \\"statistics refers to the measurement of actual events, like birth and mortality rates. Probability theory is used to derive equations that predict statistics.\\" Laplace surmised that, \\"if someone understood all the laws of physics, and knew the position of every sub-atomic particle in the universe at a single moment in time, then that someone would know everything that ever happened, and would be able to perfectly predict all future history.\\"<br /><br />As impossible as it all sounds for a human being to know everything, Fawer's novel is based on the conjecture that nothing is impossible, although certain things are infinitely improbable. Scientists named Laplace's inconceivable, omnisciently intelligent being, \\"Laplace's Demon.\\" As it happens, the protagonist of \\"Improbable,\\" David Caine, might be Laplace's Demon incarnate.<br /><br />David Caine possesses a brilliant mathematical mind, and an almost savant-like gift for calculating probabilities and statistics in his head, at calculator speed. A fourth year Ph.D. statistic student, at Columbia University, his professors call him \\"Rain Man\\" in tribute to his abilities. Caine puts his  talents to use unwisely, however. He is a gambling addict who is presently $7,000. in debt to Russian gangster, Vitaly Nikolaev. Nikloaev runs a seedy underground gambling club in Manhattan's East Village, and he is not adverse to perpetrating serious violence if David cannot come up with the money ASAP!.<br /><br />Caine is afflicted with temporal lobe epilepsy. He began to have severe seizures over a year ago. The disease is increasing in severity and the convulsions occur more frequently. No known medication alleviates the symptoms. In fact, as the storyline progresses, the reader is given to believe that the epilepsy might be more than a medical problem. As a last straw, Caine agrees to cooperate with the scientist from hell, posing as a good friend, and be a test subject for a medication which might help him...or kill him. It's a gamble. He will receive money for participating in the experiment, which he hopes to use to pay-off his debt. The drug, combined with David's own brain chemistry, opens up an entire world. Or more accurately, his brain becomes the doorway to entire universes of knowledge, parallel realities and dimensions, the collective unconscious, infinity...and probably many other things far beyond my ability to comprehend. However, the author explains all in an understandable fashion.<br /><br />David has visions of the past, present and future and begins to use this prescience to his advantage. However, his new gifts put him in much more danger. The Russian mobster and cohorts are mere annoyances compared to the shadowy figures who are now after him. The mad director of the government's Science and Technology Research Lab would love to take possession of David's brain for major personal profit. Deadly mercenary agents are searching for him, as well as the FBI, CIA and local police. Jasper, David's schizophrenic twin brother, and the lovely but deadly rogue CIA operative, Nava Vaner, are Caine's allies, but they are on the run also, for different reasons.<br /><br />Along with non-stop action, a most original plot which takes mega-twists and turns, phenomenal characters, and a well written, highly intelligent narrative, Adam Fawer digresses with lessons on Probability Theory, Quantum Physics, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, Newtonian determinism, Einstein's theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, Jungian psychology, etc.. Don't let this intimidate you. I am strictly a Humanities person. Math and science are anathema to me. And I learned a lot while being entertained.

The Great War was over and Germany was in the throes of defeat, its citizens impoverished, with ersatz everything for sale and no money to purchase anything. The gallant young men who had marched off to fight for God, Kaiser and Fatherland a mere five years before, were dead, maimed and/or disillusioned, bitter and unemployed. A generation of young women would never marry, their potential spouses buried beneath the winter snow. When the Kaiser abdicated, Fredrich Ebert, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, established the Weimar Government in time to sign the humiliating Treaty of Versailles, which forced Germany to pay billions in gold marks - reparation money it did not have. Inflation was rampant.<br /><br />Tremendous fear of communism permeated the country. Many thought that Russia's Bolshevik Revolution would spread across the border, so most Germans were content to turn a blind eye to the loss of certain liberties, constitutional rights, and accepted the \\"strong-arm tactics\\" which prevailed against anyone who threatened the country's stability. The \\"Spartacus League,\\" (Spartakusbund), German communists named after the slave who lead a rebellion against the Romans, was founded by Rosa Luxemburg, during WWI to counter the German Social Democrats' support of the war. Luxemburg, a Marxist politician, socialist philosopher, and revolutionary, along with her colleague, Karl Liebknicht, challenged Reichschancellor Ebert's government, as did the far right-wing Free Corps (Freikorps). Miss Luxemburg's failure to organize a coherent political opposition to the Social Democratic leadership proved fatal both to the outcome of the German revolution and to her own life. The state forces reasserted control and crushed the rebellion, brutally murdering Rosa, Karl Liebnecht and many other Party members, sympathizers and workers.<br /><br />Although Rosa, called the \\"Devil Jewess\\" by her enemies, was assassinated on January 15th, 1919, her body was not discovered until five months later. The mystery of her corpse's location during that winter and early spring has never been solved. Jonathan Rabb proposes a credible solution in his penetrating historical mystery, \\"Rosa.\\" The author's extensive research on life in post-WWI Germany enriches this fascinating novel tremendously.<br /><br />Detective Inspector Nikolai Hoffner, and his young assistant Hans Fichte, find themselves at the center of Berlin's revolutionary violence. Their offices at Kriminalpolizei, (Kripo), Headquarters are right on Alexanderplatz, at the center of the chaotic uprising. The social upheaval and subsequent battles provide but a momentary distraction for the two detectives, however. A vicious serial murderer is on the loose in Berlin, and their attention is intensely focused on the case. Four middle-aged women have turned up dead, all mutilated with identical, intricate markings etched into their backs. Hoffner and Fichte have spent almost six weeks trying to solve the bizarre crime. When the political police (Polpo) intervene, veteran cop Hoffner is disturbed and angry. Why would they be interested in a serial murderer? A fifth body is discovered - the MO is the same. Later that day, at the morgue, honchos from Polpo reveal yet another lifeless body, number six - this one is Rosa Luxemburg. She has the same marks carved into her back as the others. If Miss Luxemburg had been assassinated by the authorities, as rumored, or been killed by an angry mob, also rumored, then why and how did she receive the specific signature of the serial killer? No one, other than the police, knew of the killer's existence, nor about any of the clues at the crime scenes. The revolution had been front page news for weeks. And the Kripo was certainly not looking to enlighten the public about a mass murderer and their failure to catch him.<br /><br />The Polpo take possession of Luxemburg's body and refuse to release it. As Hoffner conducts a labyrinthine criminal investigation, suspense heightens as startling discoveries are made - in Berlin, Munich and Belgium. In the process a wide cast of compelling secondary characters are introduced, including a Jewish expert in lace making, Oliver Twist-like errand boys who work for the highest bidder, a charismatic pilot, Leo Jogisches, a former lover and colleague of Rosa's, Albert Einstein, Dietrich Eckart (Hitler's mentor), and artist Kathe Kollwitz. The Polpo goons are always a step behind or just ahead of Hoffner. In spite of continual warnings to ignore their machinations, the Detective Inspector persists on his own course. Subplots of love, betrayal, anti-Semitism, secret societies and the political foreshadowing of Nazism make for a riveting read.<br /><br />Nikolai Hofner is a superb multi-faceted character. He is a consummate professional, a brilliant detective, with a tremendous sense of irony, driven to discover everyone involved in this most complex of cases. He will not be deterred. A man with a past, a flawed yet courageous individual, Nikolai develops feelings of compassion and admiration for Rosa Luxemburg, as he begins to know her through her papers and his investigation. He also demonstrates fairness and sympathy for his partner's weaknesses. However, he is unable to show his wife and sons the love he feels for them.<br /><br />This is a fantastic novel noir set in an extraordinary place and time in history. The narrative is fast paced and well written, filled with period detail. The mystery at the book's core is a real one and the author's solution is creative, believable and thrilling in its implications. I highly recommend \\"Rosa.\\"<br /><br />JANAAs Hoffner conducts a labyrinthine criminal investigation, suspense heightens as startling discoveries are made - in Berlin, Munich and Belgium.

Big Jack McCormick owns Camp DoeRun, a cushy hunting lodge built on his own private parcel of West Alabama woods. Flush with game, this singular piece of forest is reserved for McCormick and his fellow huntsmen, a select group of five, in particular. These white men, are all honchos, pillars of their Three Breezes, Alabama community - the sheriff, an attorney, a bank president and McCormick's smarmy right-hand man. They get together regularly, far from their wives and families, their lip service to moral codes and the letter of the law left behind, to catch fish, shoot dove, turkey, and deer, drink, dine well and play with women, brought in especially for their fun and titillation. The aberrant is encouraged. Sometimes, there is just one women for all five, usually a beauty. Then the men would play \\"The Game.\\"<br /><br />On a brisk November night in 1958, twelve year-old Cecil Durgin, a \\"colored orphan,\\" was working up at DoeRun. He had been trained to accompany the hunters, flush the game, skin and field dress deer, cook, clean, fetch and carry. On this one fall evening, which is to mark Cecil's life forever, he witnesses the perverse Game as it is played-out, and the vicious murder at the evening's finale. At his young age, the boy knows, as did most African Americans, that \\"life could be taken on any whim or mangled on a dare, that his own silence meant life.\\" This lesson is brought home brutally the following morning when Big Jack has a talk with Cecil.<br /><br />Thirty-two years later, The Reverend Cecil Durgin is, himself, a pillar of the Three Breezes community. He is the owner of radio station WDAB, and has his own show preaching \\"common-sense scripture,\\" playing Gospel music, imparting local news, and offering spiritual advice. He has become a spokesperson for the black community, and politically, he can deliver the vote. Thus he bargains with those he detests to do what is best for the town's people. He still harbors dark secrets, however, and the resulting neuroses, brought on by his painful childhood, threaten his relatively solid marriage to a woman who loves him and shares his burden. Cecil occasionally drives through McCormick's woods to visit a place haunted by memories of a women long dead, and to think about the guilt he feels for endangering his marriage.<br /><br />An important election is coming up, one which could significantly impact the ever accumulating wealth of the four remaining DoeRun lodge men. They see Cecil as a major threat to their plans, and although times have changed significantly since that November evening in 1958, they still have the Klan around to do their bidding. The fast paced, taut narrative moves toward a chilling conclusion, gathering momentum and building tension as it goes. Cecil is not the only one scarred by secrets, which are all about to come to light.<br /><br />Suzanne Hudson paints a dark and disturbing portrait of the south as it was, with its brutal enforcement of strict class and color lines. She vividly depicts the omnipotence of a powerful few who were able to destroy, with impunity, the lives of the innocent, with a single gesture or word. Here men gave more respect and importance to the game they hunted and prized, than to the blacks they lynched. She evokes feelings of gut-wrenching fear and humiliation, as the reader empathizes with the victims of savage inhumanity. Ms. Hudson is a powerful, talented author. I intend to spread the word.

Young Helen Lawrence had just come out into society, and unfortunately two of her beaus, older men who, although settled, of good character and wealthy, didn't meet her romantic standards. I can't say that I blame the talented, attractive young woman. I was not particularly turned-on by either of the men, myself. Middle-aged, stodgy and tiresome, they were not the answer to an eighteen year-old's dreams - even a practical eighteen year-old. A third suitor, Arthur Huntington, handsome, charismatic, and known by some to be \\"destitute of principle and prone to vice,\\" was obviously smitten by Helen, and she was drawn to him also. Her aunt emphasized that the young woman should, above all, look for character in a potential mate. She advised her niece to seek a man of principle, good sense, respectability and moderate wealth. She warned Helen away from Huntington, calling him a reprobate. Helen agreed that she should marry such a one whose character her aunt would approve of, but also argued that love should play a part in her selection. Meanwhile, Huntington, on his best behavior, continued to woo Helen until she finally accepted his proposal, on the condition of her relatives' approval. Helen knew that Arthur was somewhat deficient in sense, scruples and conduct. However, she also truly believed that with her own strong religious convictions and love, she could and would change him for the good. In spite of numerous examples of her beloved's past lechery and excesses, Helen insisted on the match. And so they married.<br /><br />Within a few months Helen became much more familiar with her husband's character. He had no hobbies nor interests, as she did. She is a gifted painter, loves to read, enjoys the outdoors, and is not easily bored. Arthur demanded all Helen's time and attention, to entertain and pamper him. When he could no longer bear the country solitude, he left for London, to reacquaint  himself with his old haunts and bachelor friends. He insisted his wife remain behind, at their estate, Grassdale Manor. Huntington's behavior worsened with time, even after Helen bore him a beautiful son. He brought his debauched friends into his home for months on end, hosting wild drinking orgies and participating in a variety of low behavior extremely insulting to his wife, indeed, even encouraging his friends to mock his spouse. Helen eventually discovered that one of the houseguests, the wife of a friend, was Arthur's longtime mistress. Thus a double adultery was being conducted at Grassdale Manor, while she and her son were in residence, along with excesses of every kind.<br /><br />It was at this point that Helen, contrary to the customs of her times, locked her bedroom door against her husband. This seems like logical behavior in the 21st century. And many might ask why she did not leave Huntington long before. In the Victorian Age, the law and society defined a married woman as a husband's property. Women were totally dependant upon their mates, and husbands could actually have their wives locked away in asylums at their whim and convenience. There is a scene in the novel where Arthur has all Helen's paints and canvasses destroyed, and takes possession of her jewelry and money, so she cannot leave him. When the profligate begins to manipulate his young son, encouraging the child to drink and curse his mother, Helen does run away with her child.<br /><br />As the novel opens, we find her living in a few rooms at the remote Wildfell Hall, under the assumed identity of Helen Graham, a widow. Here she earns her living by painting. The neighbors are curious and seek her out, one in particular, Gilbert Markham. However when Helen is not forthcoming about her past, she becomes the object of ugly gossip and jealousy. Much of this compelling story is narrated through a series of letters Markham writes to a friend, and through Helen's own diary entries.<br /><br />The novel is divided into three sections: Helen's life at Wildfell Hall andher friendship with Gilbert Markham; Helen's diary describing the Huntington marriage; and the events following Markham's reading the diary. Anne Bronte's novel is powerful, haunting and quite disturbing. Miss Bronte, and her brother Branwell, served as governess and tutor to the children of wealthy aristocrats. Some of the behavior described here is apparently taken from events which Anne witnessed, and which marked Branwell severely. Ms. Bronte openly stated that in \\"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\\" she, \\"wished to tell the truth, for truth always conveys its own moral to those who are able to receive it.\\" This well written, extraordinary tale can most definitely hold its own against the works of Anne's more famous sisters, Emily and Charlotte Bronte, and those of other noted authors of the period.<br />JANAt Markham; Helen's diary describing the Huntington marriage; and the events following Markham's reading the diary.

Historically, whenever and wherever oppression exists, the people who are subject to it look for a heroic figure to defend them and to punish their persecutors. Such a paladin was Robin Hood, another is the legendary Zorro. One of my favorite authors, Isabel Allende, has reached deep into her ample well of talent and brought forth a hero who is more human than demigod. She has breathed fresh life into the Zorro of myth, and gifted him with a heart, a soul, a good mind,  an indomitable spirit and human fallibilities. This beautifully told tale of adventure and classical romance is chock-full of swashbuckling swordplay, ocean voyages, pirate attacks, Native American lore and rites, detailed fencing episodes, social injustice, secret underground societies, evil villains, duels at dawn, damsels in distress, unrequited love, gypsy camps, noble drawing rooms, drama, rollicking humor, vivid characters, tremendous energy...and so much more. The story's narrator is even a mystery person whose identity is not revealed until the conclusion. Ms. Allende's \\"Zorro\\" is a glorious literary adventure which will provide hours of entertainment for young and old alike.<br /><br />Don Diego de la Vega was born in Alto California at the end of the 18th century to a Spanish aristocrat, and the daughter of a Shoshone shaman and a Hispanic soldier turned deserter. Diego is raised alongside Bernardo, the son of his Indian wet nurse, and the two milk brothers remain inseparable throughout their lives. Although born into privilege, Diego becomes aware of social injustice at a very early age because of his mestizo blood and his bonds of friendship and brotherhood with Bernardo. European settlers continually perpetrate acts of violence against the Native American population and the two boys are helpless to come to the defense of their people.<br /><br />The two receive a multi-faceted education. The Shoshone teach them how to hunt and fight like Indian braves. White Owl, the shaman and Diego's grandmother, instructs them in indigenous lore, sends them on individual quests for a vision and their totems, and brings them through the rites of manhood. After a fox saves Diego's life, the small animal, el zorro, becomes his emblematic animal. White Owl tells him, \\"Zorro is your totemic animal, your spiritual guide. . . You must cultivate its skill, its cleverness, its intelligence.\\" Don Alejandro de la Vega gives his son lessons appropriate to a young Spanish grandee, including fencing, and instructs him about all things necessary to run their enormous rancho. Whatever Diego is taught, he passes on to Bernardo. The first part of the novel is about life and politics in California, Mexico, and Europe during the Napoleonic Wars, along with vignettes of the events and traumas which touch and effect the lives of the boys, and their families, as they move into adolescence.<br /><br />Diego is sent to Barcelona to receive a noble's education, like that of his Spanish ancestors. Bernardo accompanies him, as a servant, even though he is no such thing. They stay with a close friend of de la Vega's, a Francophile, Tomas de Romeu, who has two daughters, the beautiful Juliana, and the spunky, younger, cross-eyed Isabel. The girls and their duena Nuria, are to play important roles in this tale. All of Spain is under Napoleon's control and the Spanish are rebelling. Guerilla fighters attack the French forces everywhere. Meanwhile, Diego enrolls in the School of Humanities, and is mentored by the famous fencing master, Maestro Manuel Escalante, who literally wrote the definitive manual on the art of swordplay. Escalante recruits Diego into the secret society, Justicia, whose members' are pledged, \\"To seek justice, nourish the hungry, clothe the naked, protect widows and orphans, give shelter to the stranger and never spill innocent blood.\\" It is in Barcelona that the revolutionary character Zorro is born.<br /><br />The novel's final chapters deal with the return of Diego, Bernardo, their traveling companions, and Zorro. And in Alto California, Zorro confronts his enemies at last, the homegrown kind and those who have pursued him from abroad.<br /><br />As always, Isabel Allende's narrative is a delight to read. Her descriptive passages bring to life the local color, sounds and smells of Indian villages, the hacienda, the California countryside, Barcelona, gypsy camps, the sea, and a pirates' island. Her characters brim with life. \\"Zorro: A Novel\\" is better than the stuff of legend and a book I highly recommend for an adventure-packed read.<br />JANAnions, and Zorro.

The saga of Roland Deschain, Gunslinger of the line of Eld, and his \\"ka-tet,\\" (those whom destiny hath joined), continues in \\"Song Of Susannah,\\" the sixth, and penultimate novel in Stephen King's phenomenal Dark Tower series. As all readers should know by now, Susannah Dean is the woman who was born when her two former personalities, Odetta Susannah Holmes and Detta Walker merged. She has now been overtaken by a third persona, the demon-mother Mia, pregnant with her \\"chap,\\" Mordred, who presents a deadly threat to the ka-tet and their mission. Eddie Dean, previously a drug addict and mule in New York City, is Susannah's husband, Roland's right-hand man, but not the father of the child Susannah/Mia carries. Jake Chambers, is a boy from Manhattan who died twice in Book #1, was subsequently and symbolically reborn in Mid-World and is Roland's surrogate son. Oy, is their talking pet billy-bumbler, and all around Gunslinger helper. And Pere Donald Callahan is the ka-tet's newest member, from Calla Bryn Sturgis, and before that from Stephen King's novel \\"Salem's Lot.\\" Together the six walk the path of the Beam, searching for the Tower, that magical edifice which holds together time and all universes. Their quest is to prevent the destruction of the Tower, and the unthinkable consequences, by the fearsome Crimson King and his evil forces.<br /><br />\\"Song of Susannah \\" opens where \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" left off, with Jake, Callahan and Oy going through the door in the Cave near Calla. Their destination is 1999, New York City, and their mission is to find and help Susannah avoid the horrors which await if Mia takes total control of her body. The woman/women are also about due to go into labor, and will be at the mercy of the Crimson King's sinister \\"low men\\" if not rescued in time. Jake, Callahan and Oy must also find and take possession of the mighty and deadly Black Thirteen.<br /><br />Roland and Eddie travel through the same door to  East Stoneham, Maine, in the year 1977, to buy the vacant lot located at Second Avenue and Forty-Sixth Street in Manhattan, where grows the precious Rose, the manifestation of the Tower on Earth. The two Gunslingers must find Calvin Tower, who is in hiding near town with his friend Aaron Deepneau, and convince Tower to sell them the property. Meanwhile, Enrico Balazar and his thugs have also traveled to  East Stoneham, to murder Tower and Deepneau and gain control of the lot. If they do, the lot will be bought and the Rose captured and destroyed by North Central Positronics and Sombra, the multilateral corporations responsible for much of the wasteland Mid-World has become.<br /><br />The first four Dark Tower novels are amongst the best pop fiction I have ever read, and certainly King's best work. I love this epic saga, and Roland in particular, who is certainly my ideal classic hero. There have been more than a few times when I became so engrossed in the story I almost forgot I was reading fiction - so real did the Gunslinger and his ka-tet seem, and so grave their danger - and ours. Nothing less than the future of all universes and time is at stake here. Right? Book five was somewhat of a disappointment. Instead of multiple plots, much action, taut writing and increasing tension, the novel was overlong, slower paced, included too much repetition and filler, and of all things, introduced the author as a character, as well as brought forth a character from one of King's early books. I had read \\"Salem's Lot\\" years ago and had forgotten much of the story - thus I missed out on a good part of \\"Wolves of the Calla's\\" significance. Why weren't loyal readers warned to brush up on King's prior novels? Still, I thought it was an above average read, although not even close to the quality of the previous four novels.<br /><br />Stephen King has become increasingly self-indulgent and this becomes quite evident in \\"Song of Susannah.\\" The first books are so good that it would be impossible to spoil them for me, and nothing can permanently detract from the ka-tet's members, nor their mission. However, by not only making himself a character here, but a major character, King errs greatly. Just as Susannah has been taken over by Mia the host, King's ego has dominated the talented author. King even describes his own laugh as, \\"charmingly goofy.\\" Puleeze!! The result is not worthy of the series. King has Roland and Eddie visit him and the three discuss the Dark Tower series. Brave, serious, purposeful Roland actually becomes frightened when he realizes he is but a figment of the author's imagination. The dark drama suddenly takes on a circus-like atmosphere. For a minute, I felt kind of like a kid being told there's no Santa Claus. The introduction of King's biographical material, etc., and reinforcing that the heroes are fictional, diminishes the power and magic of Roland of Gilead, Mid-World, et.al., and brings the reader crashing back to reality, in my opinion. I also found distracting and irrelevant the CODA or King's writer's journal, which highlight events in the author's life from 1977 - 1999. Why?<br /><br />Not only would I never discourage anyone from reading \\"Song of Susannah,\\" I firmly believe that those who miss out on this extraordinary series are denying themselves some major literary pleasure. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. I highly recommend all 7 books, although I have yet to read the last one. At this point, I don't care how King ends his epic. I just know that he has taken me, so far, on a glorious 3500 page ride, (approximately), and I have loved almost every minute of it. Nothing that occurs in the final book, or that happened in this one, can spoil my glorious experience with the Dark Tower. I do believe in calling it like it is, though, and Mr. King got it wrong with this one...but it is still a decent book.<br />JANAetract from the ka-tet's members, nor their mission.

This book and the previous one, \\"Dead to The World,\\" are much better novels than the first three. Extortionist witches, shape-shifters, and faerie's have been added to the supernatural cast, which originally consisted of vampires and one or two other preternaturals. \\"Dead As A Doornail,\\" is complex, providing multiple plots, fascinating characters, and lots of action.<br /><br />Readers knew from the previous southern vampire episode that there was a possibility Sookie's brother Jason could become a shifter. He was bitten numerous times by a werepanther who had kidnapped him. And sure enough, at the full moon Jason turns into a large sleek cat, and is proud of it. The werepanther community at Hotshot, in wooded Renard Parish, welcomes him and makes him feel part of the pard. Sookie had been fearful Jason would have a terrible emotional reaction to the change and was so relieved at his accepting attitude. However, her relief turns to terror when a sniper begins killer local shifters, endangering her only kin. Sam, her boss, owner of Merlotte's Bar, and occasional collie, (at the full moon), has become increasingly attentive to our lovely blonde protagonist. While they are closing one evening, he is shot and wounded by a sniper's bullet. He remains very much alive, although his leg is temporarily out of commission.<br /><br />Sam is concerned about Sookie's safety, and he also needs a bartender while he is recuperating. Therefore he sends Sookie to Eric, Sheriff Vamp of the Shreveport area and proprietor of Club Fangtasia, to ask for his assistance. Eric, has always been turned-on by the attractive barmaid, and knows something meaningful happened between them. He just can't remember. Sookie cared for Eric while he was bespelled by witches. Amnesia was the consequence, rendering the all powerful head vampire, relatively helpless and frightened. Now, that he is back to normal, he has no memory of the entire episode. But he wants very much to find out about anything concerning him and Sookie, and a possible murder, which he may have been involved in. Eric sends pirate-like vampire Charles to be bodyguard and tend bar. Meanwhile someone(s) is out to get Sookie. Two serious attempts are made on her life.<br /><br />When Calvin Norris, the leader of the pack...er pard, is seriously wounded by the sniper, Jason's life is endangered. The formerly hospitable residents of Hotshot, now suspect Jason of the shootings, believing he is resentful of the change forced upon him and is seeking revenge on all lycanthropes.<br /><br />And as if life in Bon Temps is not already complicated, the local werewolf leader dies and a new chief must be selected. As \\"Friend of the Pack,\\" Sookie must get involved in the election politics, and old friend Alcide Herveaux's father is a contender. Bill Compton, Sook's former lover is also back in town.

In \\"Perdido Street Station,\\" author China Mieville creates the gritty, chaotic, macabre metropolis of New Crobuzon, in the world of Bas-Lag. The congested metropolis is, \\"a huge plague pit, a morbific city. Parasites, infection and rumor were uncontainable.\\" This fabulously detailed parallel world of dark fantasy engaged me from page one, with its phantasmagoric characters and nightmarish landscapes. Its citizens, humanoid and other, are an extraordinary mix of bizarre races and species. One of the most fascinating things about the book is the language. Reminiscent of, but different from, the \\"nadsat\\" vocabulary in Anthony Burgess' \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" it is not difficult to decipher and adds authenticity, and a kind of poetry, to the surreal environment. The city's hub, the main station where all rail lines cross, is Perdido Street Station. Magic is a part of everyday life here, Hell exists, as does Satan, but electricity does not.<br /><br />Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin, a huge, graying hulk of a man, is a brilliant, if eccentric, scientist. One day a garuda bursts in on him, to his utter astonishment and delight. He had never seen one before, as their native environment is in the desert land of Cymek, far from New Crobuzon. The tall creature, Yagharek by name and title, has a bird face and beak, intense black eyes, and what appears to be a pair of large wings beneath his cloak. He has come to commission Isaac for a crucial job. Yagharek's tale is a tragic one. Garuda are nomads, meant to fly and live free in the wilderness. They are an egalitarian society and totally individualistic. Cities are anathema to them. As punishment for a crime, he was cruelly de-winged. Although he believes this extreme sanction is just, he cannot bear living earthbound. He wants to hire the scientist to restore his power of flight, naturally - without taking potions or using artificial contraptions. Isaac, is up-front with the garuda, and explains he is a \\"dilettante and a dabbler, not a chymist, biologist or thaumaturge.\\" However, he believes he can do the job. Unfortunately, in his research on the physiognomies of flight, the scientist unknowingly unleashes the monstrous and lethal slake-moths to prey upon the citizens of New Crobuzon.<br /><br />Lin, is a khepri, a race of human-insects (for some reason I always picture them as lobster-like), and a gifted artist. She sculpts, and spit is her medium. She is also Isaac's secret lover. Human and khepri mingling is forbidden. Actually, all interspecies relationships are frowned upon. Although Lin wants to reveal their relationship, Isaac wishes to avoid disclosure. He is much more conservative, while her circle of friends, artists, intellectuals and underground journalists, are considered libertines and bohemians. Mr. Motley, a mysterious crime lord, and art connoisseur, sees Lin's sculptures and admires her work. He has her brought to his office, in the dangerous underworld neighborhood of Bonetown, and offers her a commission to sculpt him - probably the most difficult work she will ever do. Motley is a Remade, one of the surgically altered people, usually remade for punishment. Their final forms(s) is directly related to their crime. Mr. Motley's body is a doozy of a Remake - the term chaotic is a mild description<br /><br />This is not an easy book to read. I was tempted a few times to abandon it, actually, because of the concentration it requires. But the story, multiple plots, and characters are so compelling, I had to return to the novel. The complex storyline is well paced, but it is almost impossible to read quickly and fully absorb the rich flavor and appreciate the detail. Parts of the book are slow, in fact they plod, especially in the second half. Again, however, it is necessary to read the entire narrative, and it is addictive, all of it, so once you begin, do not expect to put it down easily. In retrospect, I think it is a terrific and most unusual novel, and certainly plan to read more of Mr. Mieville's work.<br />JANAwork.  JANA	2005-05-08

Author Juan Rulfo's extraordinarily powerful novel, \\"Pedro Paramo,\\" captures the essence of life in rural Mexico during the last years of the 19th century, and the beginning of the 20th, like no other work of fiction. Here, in a mere 124 pages, the author vividly portrays the radical social and economic changes which spurred the dramatic migration of the campesinos from ranchos and villages to the urban slums, where they could no longer live off the land, nor find work. Ghost towns mark the places where many had once flourished. I first read this masterpiece in English while living in Guadalajara, Mexico, over 25 years ago. I was absolutely captivated by the haunting story and by the fascinating characters. I reread the book a few years later, in Spanish, and was able to appreciate, first-hand, the authors skillful, nuanced use of language. After a series of surrealistic dreams, which turned my thoughts southward, I recently picked up another copy and began to read once more of the dry, deserted streets of Comala and the man who doomed the town and its inhabitants. I am amazed that the novel remains as fresh, magical and poignant as it did the first time around. I think Juan Rulfo's masterpiece takes on depth and texture with each reading. And it certainly proves true the maxim, \\"Good/great things come in small packages.\\"<br /><br />Pedro Paramo, the son of failing landowners, was consumed with love for Susana San Juan. This intense passion lasted a lifetime. Eventually, Pedro's aging father and family died, and Susana moved away. Alone and lonely, he assumed control of the estate and unscrupulously did whatever he had to, fair and foul, to amass a fortune and build his empire. He married the heiress Dolores Preciado, took possession of her land and wealth, and sent her to live an isolated existence with her sister. His ranch, in Comala, the Media Luna, expanded with great success at the expense of others. However, the manipulative, exploitive patriarch would pay dearly, in spades in fact, for his greed and for the sorrow he brought to Comala and her people.<br /><br />Dolores Preciado, on her deathbed, extracts a promise from her son, Juan, to return to Comala to find his father and claim what is theirs. Juan narrates and guides the reader on his journey to the dusty, desolate village, now populated by ghosts, lost souls who murmur to him, sighing and complaining in desperate voices, until he believes that he too is dead. The story of Juan's experience, his search for identity and his heritage, is interwoven with the tale of his father, Pedro Paramo, and that of sad, beautiful Susana San Juan.<br /><br />The novel was first published in 1955 and has become a classic, not only in Spanish speaking countries, but worldwide, for its themes are universal. This is a literary class and a truly great book. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br />JANAarly, in spades in fact, for his greed and for the sorrow he brought to Comala and her people.<br /><br />Dolores Preciado, on her deathbed, extracts a promise from her son, Juan, to return to Comala to find his father and claim what is theirs.

They search for the Tower, that magical edifice which holds together time and all universes. Their quest is to prevent the destruction of the Tower, and the unthinkable consequences, by the fearsome Crimson King and his evil forces.<br /><br />On the borderlands of Mid-World lies the remote village of Calla Bryn Sturgis. Almost all of the children born here are twins. Once every generation a large group of raiders, seemingly indestructible wolf-like creatures called The Wolves of Thunderclap, descend upon Calla and take one from each set of twins who fall within a certain age group. When the abducted children are returned, they are terribly changed, all severely retarded with reduced life-spans. The wolves are due to raid in just 30 days. A few of the town's people, who want to fight and defend their offspring, learn of the presence of the Gunslinger ka-tet in a nearby forest. They ride to meet the group of four, plus Oy, to ask for assistance. The Gunslingers' acquiescence represents a temporary divergence from their path and their trust in Ka (destiny).<br /><br />Meanwhile Susannah has a \\"chap\\" growing in her womb and Eddie is not the father. Her malady of old also returns, which seriously threatens to destroy the ka-tet when it is at its most vulnerable. Back in 1977, NYC, a single rose grows in a vacant lot on Second Avenue and Forty-Sixth Street. This is not just any flower, but the manifestation of the Tower on Earth. The same forces which seek to destroy the Tower are relentlessly trying to kill the Rose, and must be deterred at all cost. There is a magic portal, a Door in a cave near Calla, which enables Gunslingers to travel back and forth between New York, New England and Mid-World. Increasingly chaos and darkness are spreading to Earth, and elements from  Earth's culture are showing up on the Tower side of the Door, ominously foretelling of future events.<br /><br />My only problem with \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" is the introduction of defrocked priest Donald Callahan, and his overly long, repetitious story, directly out of author King's novel, \\"Salem's Lot.\\" Now I read that book years ago, when it was first published, and loved it. However, I can barely remember the plot. A large part of this novel involves Father Callahan and his past. I have invested lots of time and energy enthusiastically following the adventures of Roland and his merry group of Gunslingers through thousands of pages of prose. If I had been forewarned that a reread of \\"Salem's Lot\\" would assist me in appreciating \\"Wolves of the Calla, I would have done so, without hesitation. I am, if nothing else, a committed Dark Tower follower. But no one advised me, alas. And I do feel I missed-out on a portion of the story. I was, frankly, bored at times. I believe that Mr. King owes more to his loyal readers than to go off on a long self-indulgent walk down memory lane with a character, and plot, created many years ago. Other than this, I loved the book and believe it is a worthy continuation of one of my all time favorite epic sagas.<br /><br />Once again, the narrative is as rich as ever in its description of characters, cityscapes, landscapes and creatures. The changing relationships between the foursome, their growth as individuals and as a group, is really worth noting. Although not as adventure-packed, nor as suspenseful, as the first four novels, the book moves along at a good clip, except for most of the Father Callahan episodes. The full-color illustrations by comic book artist Bernie Wrightson are outstanding.<br /><br />At this point, I don't care how King ends his epic. I just know that he has taken me, so far, on a glorious 2000 page ride, (approximately), and I have loved almost every minute of it. Nothing that occurs in future books can spoil what I have already read. Highest recommendations!!<br />JANAtson are outstanding.     At this point, I don't care how King ends his epic.

With \\"Mystic River\\" he paints a portrait of a bleak working class neighborhood, Boston's East Buckingham Flats, and its inhabitants who are doomed to spend generations stuck in the dark, brooding environment, just a breath away from exploding into violence. I used to think of Dennis Lehane as an excellent writer of urban thrillers and mysteries. After reading \\"Mystic River,\\" I consider him to be one of America's great new literary voices. His characters are real, rich and complex; his dialogue is as true as the characters who speak it. The narrative is spare and elegant. And the plot is edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, always developing a new twist.<br /><br />The novel opens with three angry eleven year-old boys, Jimmy Marcus, Sean Devine and David Boyle, pushing each other around on one of the neighborhood streets. A car pulls up and two, plain clothes cops, (apparently), aggressively order David into their car. Terrified, David admits he doesn't live on that street. One man says they're going to drive Dave home and tell his Mom he's been fighting. Then the three drive away, leaving the other two boys with sick feelings in their guts. These feelings of fear, and something gone terribly awry, will remain with them all their lives. The two men were not cops. And Dave never reaches his mother that day, nor for many days afterward. This incident will link the lives, and the destinies, of these three boys forever.<br /><br />Twenty-five years have passed, and the boys are men now, living in the same neighborhood, not far from where they spent their childhood. The events of a seemingly innocent Saturday night on the town, turn violent. Murder most vicious is the outcome, and it brings all three, inextricably, back together.<br /><br />This tale of friendship, family, loyalty and revenge is just plain brilliant in its intensity. The unsettled feelings the novel evoked in me, stayed with me for days after I completed it. This is one of the best, well-crafted novels I have read in a very long time.

In a motivated mood, I asked my doctor recently to give me a good diet plan so I could take off many unwanted pounds. He didn't skip a beat. He told me that a healthy, balanced diet with low carbohydrate intake and daily exercise works. I have been at it for over three months now and the results in terms of pounds and inches lost are excellent. What a great way to lose weight, in a healthy manner, with a minimal amount of suffering. I am not feeling hungry, although I still long for certain foods. Thus, I have been experimenting with various low carbohydrate recipes, as I have grown a little bored with broiled meats, fish, omelettes and plain salad.<br /><br />Tod Dimmick's \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Quick and Easy Low-Carb Meals\\" is more than worthy of your attention if you are looking for good tasting food and meals with low carb counts. The book is designed for people on the go, who do not aspire to be Julia Child, and wish to adhere to a low carbohydrate lifestyle. All the recipes in this book, (almost 250), can be prepared in 20 minutes or less. From stocking your pantry through terrific ways to prepare breakfast, lunch, dinner, appetizers, snacks - there are choices galore to make your meals more exciting and interesting. Low carb doesn't have to mean \\"deprived.\\" There is even a section for kids, who are difficult to tempt, especially when their friends are gorging on fast foods.<br /><br />I have had the cookbook for a little over a week and checked-out the chapters on fish, white meat, beef and lamb, bean cuisine, salads, veggies and desserts. So far, I have made: Low-Carb French Toast with Fresh Strawberries (yum!), Low-Carb Toasted Almond Wheat Cereal, and  Florentine Scramble for breakfast; Ham and Swiss Roll-Ups, Turkey, Arugula and Almond Roll-Ups, an Open-Faced Tomato and Provolone Sandwich, and a Tuna Salad Wrap for lunch; Ginger Scallops, Broiled Lemon-Rosemary Chicken with Green Beans and Almonds, Red Beans and Rice, Herbed White Beans with Baby Spinach and Meatloaf for dinner; and Cheater' Crustless Chocolate Cheesecake (outrageous!), and Chocolate Chip Cookies. Needless to say, I feel much more motivated and less restricted as far as food is concerned.<br /><br />I also want to add that exercise is so important in the weight loss process.

I first read Gwen Bristow's \\"Jubilee Trail\\" when I was in high school and really loved the story and characters. Over the years I have frequently looked for the novel in used book stores, thinking to reread it to see if the strong narrative would hold up after all this time. I saw a well-worn copy at a friends house last month and asked to borrow it. Once again this book, rich in historic detail about the old West and the brave men and women who traveled the Jubilee Trail, held me in thrall.<br /><br />Eighteen year-old Garnet Cameron recently graduated from Miss Wayne's Select Academy for Young Ladies, a boarding school on a country estate in Upper Manhattan. She now resides with her doting parents at their home in Union Square, New York. The year is 1844. Garnet is in the process of being wooed by the cream of the local crop of eligible men, and she is just plain bored. She has always been different from her peers - more spirited and adventurous, and she is fearful she will have to surrender her dreams of travel and a more active life. She is expected to settle down, with a young banker or stockbroker, and live the staid existence her mother has. Then she meets Oliver Hale, a California ranch owner who has lived out West for eight years. Originally from Boston, he attended Harvard and then left with his older brother to buy land beyond the United States' frontiers. Oliver makes the trip East every year to trade goods from the Far East, California and Mexico. When he and Garnet fall in love and decide to marry, she is thrilled she will finally have the opportunity to travel, and much more. Before she leaves, her mother asks if she married Oliver for love, or because of the possibilities marriage to him offers. While Garnet obviously loves her husband, she is certainly not adverse to the benefits the match brings.<br /><br />The young couple honeymoon in New Orleans, and then set off for St. Louis, Independence, Santa Fe and onward to California, through the badlands and the grueling heat of the Mojave Desert. The abundance of well developed characters - all interesting, though not all likeable - are just too numerous to mention. Suffice it to say that this is a complex plot and the individuals who people it make the tale even richer. Events that neither Garnet, nor Oliver, could ever have foreseen take place, and Garnet will need all her pluck and spirit to survive.<br /><br />Ms. Bristow writes about an exciting and tumultuous time in California's history. During the period of this novel, the California Territory is transferred from Mexico to the US, and the famous Gold Rush begins.

Narayan's \\"Waiting For Mahatma\\" is set in southern India, in the fictional village of Malgudi, during the final years of the country's struggle for Independence from the British Empire. This is the second book I have read by Narayan, and I enjoyed both immensely. The author is a classic teller of tales, totally irreverent in his use of humor and irony. His straightforward prose is graceful and highly readable.<br /><br />Sriram is an orphan who has lived with his Granny since childhood. His father was killed fighting for the British in Mesopotamia, and the grandmother has received a monthly military pension for the boy ever since. She saved every penny in an account set up for Sriram, and now that he is twenty years-old, she signs the account over to him. Feeling wealthy and quite independent, he strolls around town until he is stopped by a beautiful girl, asking for a contribution. She is collecting money for Mahatma Gandhi's work. And Mahatmaji is coming to visit the people of Malgudi.<br /><br />Sriram is not particularly knowledgeable about Gandhi, nor has he thought much about Indian independence, the elimination of the caste system, and nonviolent civil disobedience. He is totally focused on the girl collecting coins for a cause. He wants to know her name, her age, her caste, her horoscope and whether she is free to marry him. He is love struck from the first glance. Later, Sriram wades into a great gathering of people, all awaiting the arrival of \\"the great soul,\\" to look for the lovely young woman in the crowd. The throng suddenly cries out in one great voice, \\"Mahatma Gandhi Ki Jai!\\" He has arrived. The great man begins to clap his hands rhythmically and loudly and asks the crowd to do the same, with vigor and spirit. \\"No good. Not enough. I like to see more vigor in your arms, more rhythm, more spirit. It must be like the drum beats of the non-violent soldiers marching to cut the chains that bind Mother India.\\"<br /><br />Sriram eventually finds Bharati, the girl of his dreams, in Gandi's entourage. He asks to volunteer, to work for the cause, and charms Bharati by his obvious romantic intentions. She, however, has more serious matters on her mind. She brings Sriram to meet Gandhi, after he promises to tell the truth in all things. He suddenly blurts out that he wants to work and live in the ashram so he can be close to Bharati. Gandhi responds that Bharati must be pleased to have such a fine friend. He will permit Sriram to travel with him and his followers for a few weeks if Granny permits. When the Mahatma finally leaves the area, Sriram becomes Bharati's disciple, and she his Guru, with the great man's blessing. His parting words to the boy are, \\"Spin and read Bhagavad Gita, and utter Ram Nam continuously, and then you will know what to do in life.\\" He promises to write to both of them, and he does.<br /><br />As the struggle becomes more intense, Gandhi is jailed and many of his followers choose to protest by going to prison also. Such a one is Bharati. Sriram is left on his own to do the best he can and remain faithful to the ideals he has dedicated himself to. Although his version of nonviolent resistance is quite different from Gandhi's and Bharati's.<br /><br />Although I found fascinating, and terribly moving, all the narrative that has to do with Mahatma Gandhi, this is, in fact, a story of the common man. Most of the novel's characters are touched only slightly by the political events taking place in their nation. Their primary concerns are much more basic - food, shelter, clothing, health, etc.. The problems of the larger world may intrude occasionally, but not for long. The author perfectly portrays the small village and its peoples concerns, trials and tribulations, and juxtaposes them against Mahatma Gandhi's take on the big picture and love for his people.

She can't read their minds, and doesn't need to worry about keeping their inner voices at bay.<br /><br />Driving home from work early New Year's morning, (there was a huge party at Merlotte's Bar), Sookie sees a half-naked, shoeless man running down the road. When she stops to help the poor guy, she realizes it is Eric, charismatic owner of Club Fangtasia, and vampire Sheriff of Area 5, which encompasses Shreveport and Bon Temps. It appears that Eric has amnesia, and remembers nothing about his life except that he is a vampire. He doesn't even know why he is running, or where. He is only aware of his terror - a very strange state for the strong, confident warrior he has always been. We learn later from Eric's cohorts that a coven of powerful witches, who use their magic for dark purposes, are attempting to take control of all the supernaturals in Area 5 - vampires, werewolves, shifters, etc.. When Eric refused to cooperate with them, they cast a spell taking away his memory. Sookie brings Eric home to care for him, through sheer kindness. Her brother Jason interferes with her altruism, however, when Eric's second in command visits to figure out an emergency course of action. Eric must remain in hiding and Jason negotiates a whopping $35,000. babysitting fee for his sister. Sookie finds that Eric is no longer the suave, scary, business-first, head-honcho vampire that she had been accustomed to. He is now tender, sincere, attentive, romantic, protective of her and grateful for her loyalty and decency. Our heroine doesn't know what to make of this drastic change, until sparks begin to fly between the two. She then decides to go with the flow. After all, Bill has been gone a long time.<br /><br />\\"Dead To The World's\\" pace is fast and the action is nonstop throughout. Jason goes missing, the evil witches are on the loose, Alcide Herveaux, the hunky werewolf (from \\"Club Dead\\"), and his pack become involved in what is to be a major battle between the forces of good and evil, new characters are introduced, and much more. Per usual Charlaine Harris fills her well written narrative with humor, suspense, and thrilling plot twists and turns. The finale is outrageously good! Terrific escapist reading.

For those too young to have seen her the first time around in \\"Barbarella,\\" \\"Cat Ballou,\\" \\"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\\" \\"Klute,\\" \\"Julia,\\" \\"Coming Home,\\" \\"On Golden Pond,\\" and so many other movie greats, all the publicity surrounding \\"My Life So Far\\" might stir the interest of younger folks to view Ms. Fonda's extensive repertoire. I can't think of a more worthwhile and entertaining endeavor.<br /><br />For me, a film lover and Jane Fonda fan from way back, this autobiography held many surprises. My longtime image of Ms. Fonda has always been of a woman secure within herself, grounded, self-assured. Au contraire. The product of a privileged<br /><br />background, intelligent, creative, beautiful, talented, Jane was not as aware of her strengths as she was of her perceived weaknesses, which she really homed-in on. She suffered from bulimia, along with anorexia and a Dexedrine addiction, for more than 30 years. It is not difficult to understand the roots of her tremendous lack of self-esteem and neediness. Reading about the Fonda family, their interactions and life together while Jane and her brother, Peter, were growing up, is terribly sad. Her father was withdrawn, brooding, and distant. His lack of presence in his children's lives had a tremendous impact.<br /><br />Their mother's mental instability and eventual suicide, when Jane was twelve years-old, was devastating, although the child was not told the truth about the cause of death until much later. For years she felt tremendous guilt for not saying a final goodbye to her mom - even though she had no clue the woman was about to kill herself. Katherine Hepburn, who worked with both Henry and Jane in the movie, \\"On Golden Pond,\\" noted the actor's extremely cold attitude toward his daughter. It appears that even at the end of Henry Fonda's life, including the evening Jane accepted the Oscar for Best Actor for him, he never gave her the approval she so longed for.<br /><br />The memoir is divided into three parts, or 3 Acts, in which she chronicles her life so far in this highly readable narrative: growing up in Hollywood; student life at Vassar; Jane as Barbarella, the American sex-kitten in France, with first husband Roger Vadim; Jane as committed political activist, with an interesting take on her controversial trip to Hanoi during the Vietnam War; her second marriage to student activist/politician Tom Hayden, her third to Ted Turner, motherhood; betrayal and infidelity, (I was more shocked by the behavior of her three husbands, than by the various menages in France, where at least Jane was invited to participate); Christianity and her religious faith; etc., etc.. This is a vital woman who has been involved in many important artistic, political, and athletic/sports events during the last fifty years. She has met some of the world's most interesting people, and even lived with a few. I admire the hard work she has done to understand herself. Therapy has obviously played a major role in her life and I really respect this. It demonstrates her commitment to growth and renewal. She is a survivor.<br /><br />Her present work and energies involve the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention, (G-CAPP), which she founded in 1995 and chairs. In 2002, she opened the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory University's School of Medicine.<br /><br />Like some contemporary political figures, Jane Fonda seems to inspire an extreme, almost visceral reaction from people - folks seem to either love her or hate her. Few are indifferent. Whatever one's feelings, it is impossible to deny this woman's talent, intellect, complexity, dynamism and the contributions she has made to our society.<br /><br />It isrumored that Ms. Fonda wrote this book herself, an oddity nowadays with so many ghost written \\"tell all\\" memoirs on the market. I don't doubt for a moment that she is the author. She has proven to be extremely talented in many areas, with a variety of endeavors, over the years. Why not writing? I highly recommend this fast paced, well written autobiography. It informs and fascinates. Kudos!<br /><br />JANAt is rumored that Ms. Fonda wrote this book herself, an oddity nowadays with so many ghost written \\"tell all\\" memoirs on the market.

Sookie Stackhouse, the attractive, telepathic barmaid from Bon Temps, LA, makes her third and most delightful appearance so far in \\"Club Dead.\\" This novel marks a turning point in the relationship between Sookie and her heretofore adoring boyfriend Bill, Civil War veteran and vampire. He's got a cheatin' heart, along with other unfaithful body parts. This is unfortunate because Sookie thought she had found the man of her dreams, at long last. Not only is/was Bill intelligent, kind, considerate, tall, dark and handsome, (if somewhat pallid), but most importantly, Sookie is not able to read his mind. Folks in her backwater northern Louisiana town always treated her as if she had a disability. They made her feel ashamed of her \\"gift.\\" The major disadvantages to her telepathy had always been her inability to keep the voices at bay, even though she has learned to shield herself somewhat. She had been unable to have a relationship until Bill came into her life. How can you fall in love when you know everything your boyfriend is thinking?<br /><br />Bill had been ignoring Sookie for some time, seemingly unable to focus on anything but a computer project he was totally immersed in. He told her he was working on a secret assignment for the Queen, (vampire), of Louisiana and would be traveling to Seattle at her request. Sookie knew he was lying to her about something, if not many things. Shortly after Bill left, Eric, owner of Club Fangtasia and vampire boss of Area 5, which encompasses Shreveport and Bon Temps, sends Bubba, (the late, great King of Rock and Roll, thought to be dead for decades by fans worldwide, but really a vampire), to guard her. Since being turned into the undead, Bubba's voice is still golden, but his mind is dim. On Bubba's watch, Sookie is attacked by a biker werewolf at the bar where she works. Then Eric pays her a personal visit to inform her Bill has met with foul play - he has gone missing. Since the secret project concerns the Louisiana vampire community, it is imperative to find him before he can be tortured into giving away information. The charismatic Eric, who has always had the hots for Sookie,  happily tells her that Bill has plans to leave and move-in with a former girlfriend, the vicious vampire Lorena - if he is still alive. He also gives her another assignment, which she is obligated to accept.<br /><br />Alcide Herveaux, a really nice guy who happens to turn into a wolf when the moon is full, will  accompany her to Jackson, where she is to investigate Bill's disappearance. The only clue she has is that Mississippi Vampire King Russell Edgington's Club Dead might be a good place to begin her sleuthing.<br /><br />\\"Club Dead\\" has a fast paced plot, filled with humor, suspense, vampire lore and politics, new characters and excitement - not to mention Sookie's depression at being betrayed by Bill. I must say, that for a dumpee, she certainly gets plenty of male attention, although the men aren't human. Author Charlaine Harris also gives more depth to Sookie, Bill and Eric. I really like Alcide as a character and hope to see more of him in future novels. I also enjoy Sookie's downhome attitude. She is proud but not pretentious, feminine but no shrinking violet. She has got great instincts and her sense of humor is downright wicked! This is light, escapist reading at its best.<br />JANAy, it is imperative to find him before he can be tortured into giving away information.

Big Jack McCormick owns Camp DoeRun, a cushy hunting lodge built on his own private parcel of West Alabama woods. Flush with game, this singular piece of forest is reserved for McCormick and his fellow huntsmen, a select group of five, in particular. These white men, are all honchos, pillars of their Three Breezes, Alabama community - the sheriff, an attorney, a bank president and McCormick's smarmy right-hand man. They get together regularly, far from their wives and families, their lip service to moral codes and the letter of the law left behind, to catch fish, shoot dove, turkey, and deer, drink, dine well and play with women, brought in especially for their fun and titillation. The aberrant is encouraged. Sometimes, there is just one women for all five, usually a beauty. Then the men would play \\"The Game.\\"<br /><br />On a brisk November night in 1958, twelve year-old Cecil Durgin, a \\"colored orphan,\\" was working up at DoeRun. He had been trained to accompany the hunters, flush the game, skin and field dress deer, cook, clean, fetch and carry. On this one fall evening, which is to mark Cecil's life forever, he witnesses the perverse Game as it is played-out, and the vicious murder at the evening's finale. At his young age, the boy knows, as did most African Americans, that \\"life could be taken on any whim or mangled on a dare, that his own silence meant life.\\" This lesson is brought home brutally the following morning when Big Jack has a talk with Cecil.<br /><br />Thirty-two years later, The Reverend Cecil Durgin is, himself, a pillar of the Three Breezes community. He owns radio station WDAB, has his own show preaching \\"common-sense scripture,\\" playing Gospel music, imparting local news, and offering spiritual advice. He has become a spokesperson for the black community, and politically, he can deliver the vote. Thus he bargains with those he detests to do what is best for the town's people. He still harbors dark secrets, however, and the resulting neuroses, brought on by his painful childhood, threaten his relatively solid marriage to a woman who loves him and shares his burden. Cecil occasionally drives through McCormick's woods to visit a place haunted by memories of a women long dead, and to think about the guilt he feels for endangering his marriage.<br /><br />An important election is coming up, one which could significantly impact the ever accumulating wealth of the four remaining DoeRun lodge men. They see Cecil as a major threat to their plans, and although times have changed significantly since that November evening in 1958, they still have the Klan around to do their bidding. The fast paced, taut narrative moves toward a chilling conclusion, gathering momentum and building tension as it goes. Cecil is not the only one scarred by secrets, which are all about to come to light.<br /><br />Suzanne Hudson paints a dark and disturbing portrait of the south as it was, with its brutal enforcement of strict class and color lines. She vividly depicts the omnipotence of a powerful few who were able to destroy, with impunity, the lives of the innocent, with a single gesture or word. Here men gave more respect and importance to the game they hunted and prized, than to the blacks they lynched. She evokes feelings of gut-wrenching fear and humiliation, as the reader empathizes with the victims of savage inhumanity. Ms. Hudson is a powerful, talented author. I intend to spread the word.

If you have not read the other three books, this is not the place to make your acquaintance with Merry and her fey friends for the first time. There is much to fascinate and intrigue between these pages, but not for novices to the High Court of Faerie. I suggest beginning with \\"A Kiss Of Shadows.\\"<br /><br />I view Laurell Hamilton's tales of Merry Gentry as effective serial fiction - an epic story which is told over a number of separate installments. A \\"Stroke of Midnight\\" is not a stand alone book. The series' bottom-line is that Faerie is dying - Seelies and Unseelies, all. The sidhe rarely have children anymore, which is why Merry must bear a child in order to reign. Meredith's Aunt Andais, the Queen of Light and Darkness, is almost convinced that her son, Cel, would make a really rotten king, which is why she made Meredith co-heir, with the crown going to whoever becomes a parent first. Merry has a 6 month head start because Cel is imprisoned for a variety of heinous crimes he committed. He is fortunate his mother loved him too much to do the just thing and sentence him to death.<br /><br />As the novel begins, Princess Meredith is still inside the Unseelie's hollow hill, their haven or sithen. She and her elite bodyguards, each a potential father to the child she has been challenged to bear, and each a potential King to the Queen she may become, flew in yesterday from Los Angeles at the Queen's invitation. There was business to discuss and a special court banquet to attend last evening. The human media, with camera crews and photographers, have been allowed into the sithen today, an event which rarely occurs. When the Princess and her entourage arrived in St. Louis, she was almost assassinated and one of her guards was wounded protecting her. The press conference is being held to show the world that Meredith is well. As the reporters prepare to leave, Merry is informed that there are two dead bodies in the hallway near the kitchen - one human reporter and one Unseelie have been murdered.<br /><br />Meredith manages to convince the Queen to allow a local police detective and crime lab to work the murder cases with her and her crew. Human forensics are much more effective than faerie magic when solving a murder, or two. Most of the Merry men have detective experience. Back in LA they work, along with Ms. Gentry, for the Grey Detective Agency, which specializes in \\"Supernatural Problems, Magical Solutions.\\" The whodunit is just one of the intriguing subplots which unfold here, as is a plot to overthrow the Queen.<br /><br />\\"A Stroke of Midnight\\" deals, primarily, with the acquisition of power, the consolidation of alliances, outing enemies, and either winning them over or eliminating them. Meredith's acceptance by the Nonseelie Court is imperative if she is to rule there one day. Many courtiers view her as a partial human, a mortal mongrel, not fit for the throne. Fey politics are extremely complex. The saying, \\"The enemy of my enemy is my friend,\\" takes on a whole new meaning in the world of the immortals. If Merry comes into power and the good guys win, the lost power of the faerie will be restored. If they lose, I don't want to be around to watch. The novel's action, fast paced as it is, takes place over a short period of a few days. However, much is accomplished in demonstrating to the Unseelies how powerful Princess Meredith has become.<br /><br />And her powers have increased significantly over the last two books. Danu, the Goddess whom the Tuatha De Danaan are named after, appeared to Merry in a dream, and she was given a sacred chalice. The chalice remains with Meredith in the waking world. The Goddess will walk with Merry again, and with a few select Ravens, in an \\"other-world\\" where their powers of old will be renewed. Merry, through the Goddess, is now able to restore past magic and supernatural gifts to some of her guards - to  reawaken their godhead. Maeve Reed, Hollywood star, and a Sidhe exiled from Faerie, was remade into Conchenn, the faerie goddess she once was. Rhys is Cromm Cruach once more, as in times of old. And Doyle has taken on new form, actually many forms. The heavy silver octagonal ring Queen Andais gave the Princess has also regained power on her finger. In this book the ring's power increases as, seemingly, do all whom Meredith touches, especially her Raven warriors. She has picked up several new ones, at the Queen's behest.<br /><br />For those who are turned off by Meredith's sexual activities, I say, do not place human values on the fey. Merry may be mortal, but she is not a human being. And who is to say she will remain mortal? She does have connections to the Goddess, after all. Also, the sex is not very graphic, certainly not by today's standards. As a matter of fact not by the standards of 25 years ago either. There is just too much going on in this magical world to obsess about the act necessary to make Merry pregnant and to restore fey power. I don't think Ms. Hamilton invented fertility rites. I know it bothers some that the Princess \\"sleeps around,\\" but monogamy is just not part of the plot.<br /><br />As always, Laurell Hamilton has come up with a winner. Although I am a die-hard Anita Blake fan, it is difficult not to quickly be drawn into the world of faerie, and Merry and her men are delightful. I find Ms. Hamilton's novels, in both her Anita Blake and Princess Meredith series, to be extremely well-plotted, with taut narratives. The dialogue is superb, often humorous, and hip, per usual. There are flaws, but I was so busy enjoying myself, I didn't bother to count them. Highly recommended!<br />JANAken their godhead.

I would suggest beginning with \\"A Kiss Of Shadows.\\"<br /><br />Princess Meredith is still in Los Angeles with her elite bodyguards, each a potential father to the child she has been challenged to bear, and each a potential King to the Queen she may become. For if Meredith does prove fertile, and bears an heir to the throne, she will indeed inherit the Unseelie Crown, not her cousin Cel, the Queen of Air and Darkness' only child.<br /><br />This novel is different from most. It is not a stand alone book. I look at Laurell Hamilton's tales of Merry Gentry as effective serial fiction - an epic story which is told over a number of separate installments. All Ms. Hamilton's novels, in both her Anita Blake and Princess Meridith series, are well plotted. Sometimes, however, the reader needs to take a step back and look at the big picture, because issues are not always resolved between the pages of one book. \\"Seduced by Moonlight\\" is not short-term plot driven. The epic's bottom line is that faerie is dying - Seelies and Unseelies, all. The sidhe rarely have children anymore, which is why Merry must bear a child in order to reign. Their custom is that marriage is not permissible unless the female becomes pregnant. Queen Andais is almost convinced that her son would make a rotten king, which is why she made Meredith co-heir, with the crown going to whoever becomes a parent first. Merry has a 6 month head start because Cel is imprisoned for a variety of heinous crimes he committed. He is fortunate his mother loved him too much to do the just thing and sentence him to death.<br /><br />\\"Seduced By Moonlight\\" deals with the acquisition of power, the consolidation of alliances,  Meredith's preparation for two crucial meetings, one with Queen Andais and her court, the other with Taranis, King of Light and Illusion, and his Seelie nobility, and the events which occur at the Unseelie banquet. The consequences of these assemblages could be critical to the entire future of the fey. Politics amongst the immortal is extremely tricky. There are all kinds of allies and enemies, supporters and detractors, neutrals, all the above, none of the above, and various combinations of the above -  in the Seelie world, and in that of the Unseelies. If Merry comes into power, the good guys win, the fey folk survive and thrive, with their old magic restored. If they lose, I don't want to be around to watch. The action takes place over a short period, but much is accomplished in furthering Meredith's image as sidhe powerful, rather than the mongrel, part human mortal her detractors call her.<br /><br />Meredith and her Merry men conference via mirror with Kurag, Goblin King. It is important to have his support and that of the slaugh, (nightmarish monsters which all the fey fear), for the upcoming events. They must negotiate all this. As part of the deal struck, the Princess' entourage is richer by two, the twin goblins Ash and Holly, who will be made sidhe. And for every goblin \\"turned\\" sidhe, Meredith's alliance with Kurag will accumulate in length of time.<br /><br />Merry's powers increase significantly here. Danu, the Goddess whom the Tuatha De Danaan are named after, appears to Merry in a dream, and she is given a sacred chalice. The chalice remains with Meredith, however, in the waking world.

I know it bothers some that she \\"sleeps around,\\" but monogamy is just not part of the plot. <br />  <br />The pace is fast, although it may not carry anyone further than a few days forward in time, the dialogue is superb, often humorous, and hip, per usual.

Popular demand for social justice collided with traditional agrarian, almost feudal, societies. The rapid expansion of commercial agriculture drove small peasants off the land and into urban areas where they did not have the skills to make a living, and lost their pride in indigenous traditions and their positions of worth in their local communities. Industrial development fostered the growth of the urban working class and middle class, creating professional and blue collar jobs, but the poor and uneducated remained disenfranchised, with extremely high infant mortality rates, and almost no healthcare. The usually conservative Catholic Church became an agent for justice, popular mobilization and change. People demanded democratic reforms in the authoritarian political system, long dominated by landed elites and protected by vicious dictators and their military. In Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador, the reformist wave was broken by more repression and the mass murder of local populations.<br /><br />Kate Banner, a trained midwife, travels to Chiapas, Mexico in 1981, to visit her best friend, Maggie. She meets a man, Mark Deaver, the son of a wealthy American woman who has settled there. Mark is an adventurer of sorts, who will eventually run guns for the Sandinistas. Kate believes they will return to the United States one day, or somewhere away from the violence in Central America, and make a life together. In the meantime, she works with some of the 100,000 Guatemalan refugees who fled over the border to Chiapas for asylum, to escape the violence in their homeland. She delivers babies, administers first aid, and assists doctors, whenever one happens to appear. While Kate had never thought of herself as a revolutionary, she was strongly impacted, as a young girl, by the Civil Rights Movement, the bombing of the Baptist Church in Birmingham, the murders of innocent students at Kent State University, the protests against the War in Vietnam, photographs of Vietnamese children screaming with napalm burning their backs. She remembers the nuns telling her to \\"remember that you have been called to live in freedom.\\" \\"You shall love they neighbor as thyself.\\" Although she never believed in armed struggle, like Mark - she did want to help the victims of the violence.<br /><br />Eight years after her arrival in Mexico, Kate is living in Sandinista held Nicaragua, working in a clinic for women and children. She and Maggie are members of a community of activists, dedicated to helping the people of war-torn Nicaragua. Unfortunately, her relationship with Mark has been on the wane for some time, which causes her a great deal of anguish. While she still loves him, he has never really met her needs, or even knows what they are. She has finally come to grips with the futility of their relationship, and acknowledges the pivotal moment she has arrived at in her life. It is time to move on. After a hurricane hits, Kate delivers a baby in the bottom of a swamped boat. When the mother dies, Kate packs the few possessions she has. After years of service, she is physically and emotionally exhausted, and very sad. It is time to leave for the US. She wants Maggie to accompany her to Antigua, Guatemala, and stay with some close friends they haven't seen in a while. Then - on to Michigan. Maggie, however, has ideas of her own. She wants to travel into the countryside with Bob, the new man in her life, and will meet up with Kate in Antigua.<br /><br />Kate's journey north, into the seething politics and secret wars of Guatemala, will provide the most difficult challenges she has ever faced. She will also meet people who will change her life forever, and find grace and love where she never thought to.<br /><br />This is a story as powerful and compelling as you will ever read. Patricia Henley's masterful narrative and elegant prose illuminate the characters she brings to life on the page - people determined to stand-up for their rights to live free. She infuses \\"Hummingbird House\\" with passion, beauty, outrage, despair and hope. The novel concludes with these moving lines, \\"We see with quite clear eyes the war beneath the wars.

Her mother, an American Irish Catholic and her father, a Lebanese Christian, met in college and wed soon after. They parted during their daughter's fifth year.<br /><br />\\"My mother's boyfriend got a crush on me, so she sent me to live with my Daddy. I didn't want to live with Daddy. He has a weird accent and came from Lebanon.\\" Thus, Jasira begins her story. Her narrative may sound more like that of an ten year-old, rather than an adolescent girl living in 21st century America, but she does get her facts straight. When her mother discovers that live-in boyfriend Barry is paying inappropriate attention to daughter Jasira's budding sexually, she blames the girl, and sends her away from home in Syracuse, NY, to live with her father in Houston. Gail Monahan, Jasira's mom, informs her that she \\"was always walking around with her boobs sticking out.\\" How could Barry help but notice? Some people should never have children!<br /><br />Jasira's father, Kifat Maroun, is an educated man with conservative views and a stone-age mentality. Adjusting to life with him is challenging, to say the least. He doesn't care for the girl's blossoming womanhood anymore than his ex-wife does, especially when she begins to menstruate after a few weeks in Houston. It is about this time that he tells her she is \\"sagging\\" and takes her to buy seven uncomfortable underwire bras, although she has had her own brassieres for some time. Underwires hurt. 34-C?! No, Mr. Maroun is not a happy man! Dad expresses his anger through continual verbal abuse, which occasionally turns into smacks and slaps, and then becomes more violent. He has no problem coping with his own sexual and emotional needs, however, and finds a girlfriend soon after Jasira's arrival. He begins to leave his daughter for 2 or more days at a time, so he can stay with his lady love, of course. He tried having the woman over to his house, initially, but found she paid too much attention to Jasira. \\"You hog all the attention,\\" he said. \\"I don't know how you do it, but you do.\\" Charming. After all, big guys need attention too, and thirteen is old enough to spend a few unsupervised nights alone.<br /><br />At school, Jasira is called \\"towelhead,\\" \\"camel jockey,\\" and worse. The kids are well aware that America is about to enter the first Gulf War, and Jasira becomes an easy target for their hostility. She finds it difficult to make friends and begins fixating on Mr. Vuoso, the father of the boy she babysits. Mr. Vuoso, a married Army reservist with a large collection of Playboy magazines, seems to be more interested in Jasira than mom's boyfriend Barry ever was, with unfortunate results. Then Thomas, a black schoolmate, takes an interest in her. But her parents do not want her hanging out with an African American. An aside here, Jasira is by no means a Lolita-like character. She is no \\"nymphet,\\" nor does she use sex to manipulate. She is naive, lonely, insecure, chock-full of raging hormones, with no one to confide in.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to reading this highly publicized novel. However, now that I have completed it, I am disappointed by the lack of depth in the characters. Almost all of them are cardboard-flat and possess few redeeming qualities. How can so many people be so flat-out bad, consistently? Both of Jasira's parents totally lack affect, (both of them?), human decency and basic kindness. They appear to be suffering from narcissistic personality disorders in their absorption with self, their sense of entitlement, lack of empathy and arrogance. Having an Arab Christian as a major character is purely gratuitous. Ms. Erian offers the reader little information on the man's rich cultural background, his professional experiences at NASA, or on his thoughts as an Arab-American in a country mobilizing for war against an Arab nation. What she gives us is a fiendish stereotype, who dislikes his ex-wife, hates his daughter and despises his mother, who calls frequently from Lebanon. The neighbors, Melina and Gil are a bit more fleshed-out, but not much. Their relationship with Jasira is a breath of fresh air,  but the resolution between the couple, the girl and her parents is not at all credible, especially at the book's conclusion.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, for the first half of the novel Jasira sounds much younger than her 13 years. Her thought processes and dialogue are just too immature to be believable. She is surprisingly unsophisticated regarding her changing body. I grew up many years ago, way back in the 20th century, and still knew more than she seems to. We were taught in school, health class, back then! Then there's the media, libraries, magazines, and girl talk - just too many available sources for Jasira to remain believably ignorant. However, her intense focus on sexuality, indicative of young people experiencing major hormonal, social and educational changes, and her bewilderment, is extremely well portrayed by the author. The girl's need to be touched and cuddled is obvious, as is her ambivalence about her relationship with Mr. Vuoso. She is so starved for affection that she mistakes abuse for closeness and caring. She remains quite passive though, almost dazed, in her actions and thoughts throughout most of the abuse she suffers. I am surprised by her lack of anger, especially since most of the adults in her life betray her big time!<br /><br />In spite of myself, I found \\"Towelhead\\" often entertaining, in a voyeuristic, titillating kind of way. But why should a book portraying graphic physical and sexual child abuse entertain? I found the narrative to be shallow and contrived at times. Ms. Erian seems content with the facile resolution. An example is the  ending, which leaves much to be desired. I had really expected much more. I have read many positive reviews for \\"Towelhead,\\" and  feel like I am either totally out of sync, or the bystander crying, \\"The Emperor is not wearing clothes!\\"<br /><br />JANAt she gives us is a fiendish stereotype, who dislikes his ex-wife, hates his daughter and despises his mother, who calls frequently from Lebanon.

I am embarrassed to admit, as an avid reader and mystery lover, that I just made the acquaintance of this fine detective, and connoisseur of most Edinburgh and Glasgow pubs, in his sixteenth and latest book, \\"Fleshmarket Alley.\\" I find that, apart from books 1 and 2, this is a perfect place to get to know the curmudgeonly crime solver. Just as Rebus is a new character to me, he is new to his latest work situation. So, in a sense, we begin a fresh venture together.<br /><br />\\"I'm not supposed to be here,\\" Detective Inspector John Rebus said. Not that anyone was listening.\\"  As the novel begins, our hero is grumbling about the reorganization that has recently been implemented at the police station where he has spent the last eight years. St. Leonard's is closed, and he and his unfortunate colleagues have been assigned to other stations, whether they require additional staff, or not. Not to say the DI has been surplussed, but, in fact, he has been surplussed. I don't think anyone who has worked with Rebus would ever call him superfluous - certainly not his avid fans - but we all understand the inevitability of corporate downsizing, whether we agree with it or not. Thus, this often irate, but consummate professional, does not even have a CID office. He has been relocated to Gayfield Square, just off Leith Walk, a fairly upscale neighborhood, near Edinburgh's New Town. This area is just three miles from Knoxville, but traveling that brief distance is like visiting a foreign country, one with an extremely low tourism rate.<br /><br />Knoxville is a low-scale public housing project, built in the 1960s, where the large majority of residents are immigrants from developing countries. It has long been a target for racists, who want \\"Britain to remain British,\\" meaning for white Anglo-Saxon Protestants only. The buildings are covered in graffiti warning the \\"Pakis\\" to \\"Get Out.\\" Knoxville will play a significant role in this novel. It is here that a male corpse is discovered with multiple stab wounds, including one to the throat. There is nothing on the body to identify it. This vicious murder will cause John Rebus to visit places he's never been before, (and he's been around), and to form some astonishing alliances, at least unusual for him. Somewhat of a reactionary, he finds himself oddly drawn to a political activist and artist. Although the two are polar opposites, he is fascinated by the woman, and the ideals she represents - interested enough to reexamine some of his own long-held prejudices.<br /><br />While Rebus covers the Knoxville situation, his longtime \\"pal\\" and coworker Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke, also a new resident at Gayfield Square, receives a visit from a couple she worked with on a prior case. The Jardines' eldest daughter had committed suicide three years before. She had been raped, and although the perpetrator had been caught, tried and convicted, the young girl had not been able to deal with the trauma. Now, the family's second daughter has gone missing. They plead with DS Clark to help them, even though they live outside her present jurisdiction. Then another murder victim turns up, this one connected to the missing girl and her family.<br /><br />That same day, the skeleton of a female, and another of an infant, are discovered buried beneath the concrete in a newly renovated bar in Fleshmarket Alley. As diverse as these cases appear, they are all, ultimately, connected.<br /><br />Mr. Rankin is a master at creating and developing his narrative and characters. Apart from the usual suspects, I was drawn to, for better or worse: Mohammad Dirwan, \\"Mo\\" to his friends, a Glasgow solicitor who works with refugees; Caro Quinn an activist and artist Rebus meets outside Whitmire, a deportation complex; Dr. Alexis Cater, son of a famous USA movie star who is very knowledgeable about the skeletons,and is more than willing to pass the information along to DS Clark, in exchange for a date; Morris Gerald Cafferty, \\"Big Ger,\\" a supposedly retired gangster, who has the lowdown on almost everyone, and a magnificent hot tub to boot; and dancer Kawame Mana, or \\"Kate,\\" as she calls herself, a student from Senegal who works part-time in a sleazy club.<br /><br />\\"Fleshmarket Alley\\" contains additional and complex subplots, apart from the ones I mention above. More importantly, for me, Mr. Rankin takes on the social issues of smuggling illegal immigrants for profit, slave labor, terrorism, and corporate run, prison-like refugee detention houses. Along with the extremely well written police procedural, it is the examination of these controversial political and social issues that make this novel so special and unique.<br /><br />I highly recommend this latest offering from Ian Rankin, and enthusiastically plan to read some of his earlier John Rebus books.<br /><br />JANAthe skeletons, and is more than willing to pass the information along to DS Clark, in exchange for a date; Morris Gerald Cafferty, \\"Big Ger,\\" a supposedly retired gangster, who has the lowdown on almost everyone, and a magnificent hot tub to boot; and dancer Kawame Mana, or \\"Kate,\\" as she calls herself, a student from Senegal who works part-time in a sleazy club.  <br />  <br />\\"Fleshmarket Alley\\" contains additional and complex subplots, apart from the ones I mention above.

At the end of the fourteenth century, England was riddled with plagues, wars, uprisings, and political and religious strife. King Richard II, son of Edward the Black Prince, was crowned in 1377, when he was just ten years-old. His two uncles, John of  Gaunt, and Thomas of Glouster, vied for power during the Protectorate, the young King's minority. Meanwhile all Christianity was suffering through the Great Schism. Pope Boniface VIII and King Philip the Fair of France seriously quarreled, to put it mildly, about Church tithing and taxation. Finally, Boniface declared the primacy of the Church over secular authorities, the superiority of Popes over kings. Ultimately this resulted in two Popes, one in France and one in Rome. The Church, which had tremendous power in England, wanted to acquire more wealth through  tithing. The monarchy wished to tax the Church's considerable property, and institute an additional poll tax on the people. As always, the poor were penalized most. Almost a century before, in 1297, a mob of villagers and serfs burned out a group of Benedictine monks who withheld spiritual services, including the Eucharist, pending offerings they could not afford. Now the peasants were ready to revolt against the latest tax approved by John of Gaunt.<br /><br />In Oxford, English theologian and reformer John Wycliffe criticized the Church's abuses and false teachings. As the novel begins, he is working on an English translation of the Bible - the first European translation done in over 1,000 years. Since the printing press had not been invented yet, only the wealthy had access to the hand printed, beautifully illuminated copies of the Bible. \\"The Word\\" was written in Latin, or in Norman French, and the poor, and most women of all classes, did not study languages nor could they read. Wycliffe, backed by John of Gaunt, believed that everyone should have access to Holy Scripture - that God is not something the clergy had a right to keep for their exclusive use. These beliefs were considered heretic. As the author, Brenda Rickman Vantrease stresses, heresy was not the real issue here - the acquisition of power and wealth were. This was purely \\"a matter of alliances and appearances,\\" and of mass political and spiritual oppression.<br /><br />Finn, a master illuminator, works for the Church, decorating hand-written pages of scripture with gloriously painted miniature works of art. He is presently illuminating writings of the apostle John for the powerful Abbott of Broomholm. Finn is also secretly employed by Wycliffe, whom he does not charge, to illustrate his English translation. One of the Broomholm Abbey's more venal priests pressures Lady Kathryn of Blackingham Manor to give the artist and his daughter lodgings. She is afraid of the consequences if she does not agree. Recently widowed, with twin fifteen year-old sons to support, as well as her serfs and villagers, Lady Katheryn has little money left to give to the Church, let alone to feed and clothe her family, and pay taxes and tithes. Fearing for her sons' inheritance, she makes a place at her manor for Finn and his daughter. Her decision to do so will change the course of her life, and the lives of all who depend on her.<br /><br />This is a richly textured novel, filled with a multitude of colorful images, sounds, smells, events, and human stories which portray the pageantry and the cruelty of English life in the Middle Ages. The narrative also homes in on one particular noble family, and their dependents, illustrating the workings of feudal life up close and personal. Ms. Vantrease explores, through her narrative, the feudal system with an emphasis on the roles of various members of medieval society and their place in the social hierarchy. She also looks at the role of religion and that of the Church, as well as man's greed for wealth and the acquisition of personal power. There are also wonderful descriptions of the illuminating process.<br /><br />\\"The Illuminator\\"is peopled with a resplendent cast of characters and their interactions with family, friends, lovers, servants, and enemies, are revealed in the narrative. Obviously, there's Finn the Illuminator, and his lovely young Rose; Lady Katheryn; her twin sons Colin and Alfred; Half-Tom, a dwarf and a hero; Hugh Despenser, the greedy, corrupt Bishop of Norwich; Sir Guy de Montaigne, the Sheriff of Norwich, who is intent on marrying Katheryn for her land; Julian of Norwich, an anchoress filled with love and compassion, who has dedicated her life to God and to reveal Him to those who seek her out; the evil overlord Simpson; John Ball a charismatic peasant priest who preaches for \\"ecclesiastical poverty and social equality\\" for clergy; and so many others. The author really brings these individuals to life on the page, with all their foibles and complexities - she illuminates them.<br /><br />This is one of the most imaginative, well written historical novels I have read in a long time.

Princess Meredith Nic-Essus is a member of the High Court of Faerie. When she lives in Los Angles, however, as she has for the past three years, Meredith assumes the name and identity of Merry Gentry. Merry works as a P.I. for Jeremy Grey, owner of the Grey Detective Agency, which specializes in \\"Supernatural Problems, Magical Solutions.\\" She left the faerie world, the mounds at Cahokia, in Illinois, to go into hiding in California when her cousin Cel, the evil heir to the throne, attempted to have her assassinated once too often.<br /><br />Meredith's Aunt Andais is Queen of Air and Darkness, and has ruled over the Unseelies, (those not of pure fey blood), for over one thousand years. Those who have pure faerie blood are the Seelies, and her uncle Taranis, King of Light and Illusion, reigns over them. Meredith is mortal, half Seelie Court and half Unseelie, (part of her heritage is Brownie). The Queen sent Doyle, the Captain of her Raven Guard, to the West Coast to bring her niece back to the High Court. Meredith was forced to return because Andais finally realized, what was obvious to many, that her only son and heir did not possess the necessary attributes and character to become King. So the Queen placed Prince Cel and Princess Meredith on equal footing. She stipulated that whoever became a parent first would be her successor. Meredith must bear a child before Cel can father one if she wants to wear the crown. The bit about having a child is paramount, although Andais could have handled the situation more delicately. The sidhe have fertility problems. Thus, childbearing is of the utmost importance if the royal line is to continue.<br /><br />Meredith is finally allowed to escape the political machinations of court life and return to LA. Accompanying her are some of the Queen's  hunkiest Ravens, who are instructed to guard her bodily, and to enjoy it. They are to assist her to become pregnant. Wow!! The lucky father-to-be gets to become King. Excellent motivator! Plus Merry is gorgeous, ruby-red hair, and smart to boot. Oh, a goblin is included in the merry mix of immortal men, due to a pact negotiated with Kurag, Goblin King.<br /><br />Meredith and her firm are contracted, in utmost secrecy, to assist the glamorous, golden goddess of Hollywood, actress Maeve Reed, who turns out to be a Seelie in exile. Ms. Reed once said \\"No,\\" to King Taranis - thus the exile. She carries a terrible secret, and the King would kill her immediately if the information became known - which is why she is constantly surrounded by bodyguards. To complicate matters, now that Merry and her men have visited the Reed compound, the King might decide they know too much and order a mass assassination.<br /><br />Just as things begin to get dangerous, in between bedroom interludes with Merry and the Ravens, \\"The Nameless\\" are loosed on humanity. They are the most evil elements of Seelie and Unseelie combined, and much has been sacrificed to keep these beings buried and suppressed forever. So, if anyone says that \\"A Caress of Twilight\\" is just about S-E-X, they're only partially correct!<br /><br />The characters, the settings, the Ravens checking-out America and LA for the first time, Hamilton's take on Celtic mythology, are just a blast - pure entertainment! Of course, I am a major Laurell Hamilton fan and truly enjoyed her entire Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series. Merry is certainly not Anita, but she is fun.

Broussard is Orleans' Parish Chief Medical Examiner, and not only a distinguished professional, but a superb detective as well. Dr. Kit Franklyn, so far, has proven to be a less interesting figure. She is a criminal psychologist and was the county's first suicide-research investigator. She also detects.<br /><br />A mystery man has sent Kit a long-stemmed yellow rose for three successive days, always leaving the flower on her porch, where she finds it when she comes home from work. On the third evening, she discovers a note attached to the flower, asking her to meet the sender at Grandma O's Restaurant for lunch the following day. Smiling, she expects her boyfriend, Teddy La Biche, is behind this romantic gesture. Who else? When she enters the restaurant the following afternoon at 1:00 PM, the lunch crowd has thinned and there are only a few stragglers left. Teddy is nowhere in sight. Seated in the rear, an aging white-haired man, dressed in jeans and a khaki shirt, seems to recognize her. He stands to greet her, saying her name, and then collapses on the floor. He dies almost immediately, seemingly from a heart attack. Kit has no idea who he is. However, a photograph of Kit as a schoolgirl is discovered in his wallet.<br /><br />Within twenty-four hours two more corpses are found, and Chief Broussard begins to see a horrifying connection in all three deaths. A technician, who assisted Andy on the first case, the mysterious heart attack victim who expired in Grandma' O's, accidentally cut her skin through her protective glove during the autopsy. She falls ill with what turns out to be a lethal Ebola type virus - the same one which killed the others. No one knows what the name or the source is. The potential death toll of a viral epidemic centered in New Orleans is chilling.<br /><br />Adding to the suspense, Kit goes missing, kidnapped, while searching for clues to the identity of the man with the yellow roses. The hunt for the source of the virus, and the search for Kit, will take the reader all over New Orleans, from the docks to the ultimate, violent confrontation deep in the bayous. The folks who people the storyline are good, especially the ones with a touch of Creole, or more, in their blood. And the villain is an exceptionally bad dude, a psychopath, who is calm, focused and deliberate, even under duress - which makes him appear all the more evil. He, and Broussard are by far the best characters. And the analytic work and dialogue that go on during the autopsies are fascinating.<br /><br />This is a good book, however, I found some of the author's solutions too facile, too contrived.

Donaldson's \\"Cajun Nights\\" is sadly out of print, HOWEVER, it is quite easy to buy a used copy. Try Amazon's Marketplace sellers, if you're interested. I read a review for the book, and since I always like a good mystery and love fiction set in New Orleans, I bought it. This is a taut, suspenseful novel, filled with interesting characters, a plot that will keep you riveted and just a tad of the supernatural. Remember, Voodoo arrived in New Orleans after a revolution in Haiti brought the Free People of Color to the city. Besides, if the setting is the Big Easy, magic must be involved. Author Donaldson has also managed to capture the charm of the bayou, the French Quarter, and lots of additional local color.<br /><br />In New Orleans, 1738, a wealthy landowner, Albair Fauquel, and his Haitian slave, Malaqua, were hanged for using the dark arts to cast a spell over a prominent member of society. Fauquel's victim, apparently bewitched, murdered his family and committed suicide. Just before his death, with the noose chafing his neck, Fauquel cursed the city's citizens for wronging him. \\"But, I tell you this, one day I will return and right this wrong as I did the other. And the streets of this city will run with blood as friend slays friend, fathers slay their children, and rampant suicide sends the souls of men by the hundreds to everlasting hell. Beware the songs you loved in youth.\\"<br /><br />Present day, New Orleans - Dr. Kit Franklyn, a psychologist and the county's first suicide-research investigator, was just hired by Orleans Parish's Chief Medical Examiner, Andy Broussard, an aging gourmand who believes that a good meal with fine wine is better than sex, but prefers his work to either. He is superb at what he does, which includes detecting. Kit work will involve compiling psychological profiles of the decedent in cases where the physical evidence does not enable the examiner to determine whether death was accidental or suicide.<br /><br />On the first day of Kit's job, she and Chief Broussard are called to the scene of a fire at a private home. It appears that Barry Hollins, a loving husband and father had just set himself ablaze, killing his wife, two year-old daughter, and mother-in-law in the process. It was not the mother-in-law's fault. He really liked her - REALLY! Hollins had no history of unhappiness, depression or instability. Within a short period, two more violent murder-suicides occur. Franklyn and Broussard are stumped at the sudden bizarre behavior. When Kit asks the deputy medical examiner to pull up some nationwide murder-suicide statistics, the results are startling, to say the least. Eerily, clues begin to appear which link the historic past to the present. Murder attempts are made against the two protagonists. And I couldn't figure out what was going on for the life of me. I was shocked at the \\"who\\" in the whodunit.<br /><br />I have just ordered used copies of two other Andy Broussard/Kit Franklyn mysteries.

Author Ruth Rendell transcends the mystery genre with this brilliant psychological thriller, \\"A Judgement In Stone.\\" The novel is a relatively short one at 191 pages, but it sure packs a wallop in terms of its emotional impact. I finished the book last week and am still thinking about it. An unconventional mystery, the reader is informed from page one who the murder victims are, who the killers are, and, at least, their partial motivation. There are no spoilers. Yet Ms. Rendell infuses her taut narrative with suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat. I read \\"A Judgement In Stone\\" in one evening - just could not put it down.<br /><br />Jacqueline Coverdale and her husband George are desperate to find a trustworthy live-in servant to clean their large country home, Lowfield Hall. They have had abysmal experiences with au pairs and local help. This is the second marriage for each. Jacqueline is divorced and George is a widower. They met at George's daughter's wedding and it was love at first sight. After almost six years, the chemistry and affection between the two have grown. Between them they have four children, two are adults with their own homes, one young woman is at university, and an intellectually gifted teenage boy, who is  finishing secondary school with honors, lives at home. The kids all get along well and have from the beginning. Jacqueline has been run ragged trying to keep the place clean, clothes washed, meals cooked, bills paid, etc. The couple has not had the time to entertain, go to the opera, or even read a good book as often as they would like, due to all the household chores. They place an ad in the newspaper advertising for domestic help. Eunice Parchment is the sole applicant.<br /><br />From the moment Eunice is introduced, a feeling of trepidation permeates the storyline. She is in her forties, illiterate, a very serious handicap which has always caused her to keep to herself, fearing the humiliation of discovery. She is also a probable sociopath. However, she cleans, washes, polishes silver and irons like a dream. She even offers to cook, which is Jacqueline's job. The Coverdales are thrilled. They eventually begin to notice her lack of affect, but never mind - she does her work like a true professional. Ms. Parchment rarely leaves the house and spends all her free time watching the television, which the family has provided for her. She had never watched TV before. The woman is as content as she has ever been. She enjoys housecleaning because it is something she does well, and does not require reading skills. Her only fear is that she will be asked to shop from a list, although Mrs. Coverdale does almost all the shopping, or that someone will leave a note for her with instructions.<br /><br />When she meets Joan Smith, a storekeeper in the nearby town, she makes a friend, of sorts - probably the first she has ever had. Unfortunately, Joan is less stable than Eunice.<br /><br />Ruth Rendell is a master at developing characters, and her fascination with the dark side of the human psyche is obvious. She skillfully portrays each of the Coverdale family members, exploring their personalities and motivations. She is most insightful, however, at revealing what goes on in the minds of the two women, Eunice Parchman and her friend Joan, a religious fanatic. The author writes with extraordinary elegance, consistently. I can almost guarantee that if you pick this book up, you will not be able to put it down.<br /><br />Ms. Rendell, who sometimes writes as Barbara Vine, is the winner of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award. She is also the recipient of three Edgars from the Mystery Writers of America and four Gold Daggers from Great Britain's Crime Writers Association. In 1997, she was named a life peer in the House of Lords.<br /><br />JANAable sociopath. However, she cleans, washes, polishes silver and irons like a dream.

Having read her entire Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series, I truly enjoyed eleven of the twelve books, rating most of them 5 Stars. I also became extremely attached to her cast of characters, the driving forces behind many of her storylines. Few authors are able to create superb dark fantasy, complex characters, and also tell a riveting tale like Ms. Hamilton. So it was with great anticipation that I picked up \\"A Kiss of Shadows,\\" the first of the Merry Gentry novels.<br /><br />Princess Meredith Nic-Essus, \\"Child of Peace,\\" \\"Princess of Flesh,\\" \\"Besaba's Bane,\\" is a member of the High Court of Faerie, the \\"only one ever born on American soil.\\" She is in hiding from the fey folk - self-imposed exile, because there had been too many assassination attempts when she lived at court. When the fey originally left Europe, Thomas Jefferson invited these immortal and magical beings to the United States. He offered them land to settle and gave them the privilege to live in this country as an autonomous minority. They chose the mounds at Cahokia, in Illinois, as their home. The Princess' Aunt Andais is Queen of Air and Darkness, and has ruled over the Unseelies, (those not of pure fey blood, and some pretty creepy creatures are included in this category), for over one thousand years. Those who have pure faerie blood are the Seelies, (mostly blondes, and elitist snobs). Meredith's uncle, the King of Light and Illusion, reigns over them. Meredith is mortal, half Seelie Court and half Unseelie, (part of her heritage is Brownie), yet neither side wants to claim her. Her mortality frightens and disturbs them all. The Prince of Flame and Flesh, her father and the queen's brother, chose for her to be raised amongst humans. Meredith is second in line to the Elven throne, after the Queen's son and only heir, Cel, who is the most perverse and evil villain in this novel. Cel was, and continues to be, the driving force behind the assassination attempts, and the deadly duels Meredith had been challenged to. He obviously doesn't care for competition.<br /><br />The beauteous, ruby-red-headed Princess Meredith, not about to die yet, took off one day, left her possessions behind, shielded herself well, and hopped a flight to Los Angeles. Heaven knows why she picked that city - nothing against LA, but with smog and crime, there are better places to live in the USA. Assuming the name Merry Gentry, and using glamour to pose as a human being, she has worked for the last three years, (the entire period of her exile),  as a P.I. for Jeremy Grey, owner of the Grey Detective Agency, which specializes in \\"Supernatural Problems, Magical Solutions\\". She is presently living with Roane Finn, a selkie who had his seal skin destroyed and longs to return to the sea. Otherwise, they make a nice couple. Then Queen Andais sends Doyle, her right-hand male Unseelie, whom she call \\"Darkness,\\" to bring her niece back to Cahokia and the High Court. Doyle is the leader of the Queen's Guard, called The Ravens, and brings the royal sword \\"Mortal Dread,\\" to protect Meredith.<br /><br />The detective aspects of the novel are really fun: car chases, deadly spiders, illegal sale of love potions, mucho magic and a good mystery. Merry's struggle to become a member of her beyond bizarre royal family, (talk about dysfunctional), to accept her former status as an unwanted outsider,  to learn to participate in the deadly political machinations common to court life, as well as cope with an increasingly complicated sex life are fascinating. Leave it to author Hamilton. The cast of characters is strong. Of course Merry/Meredith is not feisty Anita, who would commit harikari before furnishing a room in pink and mauve. But I knew this before I began the novel and promised myself not to short-shrift our heroine because she is not Ms. Blake. I also love the supernatural creatures who people the story: faeries, ogres, trows, goblins, pixies, brownies, etc..<br /><br />On the down side, the first half of the book plods at times. Faerie history, lineage, background material, cast of characters at court and in LA, are all laid out for the reader, and it can be slow going. This is a first book in a series, and there is an abundance of information to impart, most of it quite interesting. One of Laurell Hamilton's strengths, other than her fantastic imagination, is her descriptive ability. She enables the reader to visualize some extraordinary scenarios and people. But lots of description and less action took away from some of my enjoyment. I will say that there is an action-packed case Merry is on during this period, as well as some terrific scenes with her selkie. The second half of the novel picks up significantly. I definitely recommend \\"A Kiss Of Shadows,\\" especially for those who love dark fantasy.  A compelling, magical, and frequently erotic read.<br /><br />JANA<br /> <br />On the down side, the first half of the book plods at times.

From the first sentence of \\"A Dark Adapted Eye,\\" the reader is informed that someone important is about to die. By page six, we know that this person will be hanged by the neck until dead for a murder she committed. So, this extraordinary novel by Ruth Rendell, writing as Barbara Vine, is not a classic whodunit, rather a fascinating and complex psychological drama - a more suspenseful mystery than many of the best in which the perpetrator, or murderer, remains unknown until the conclusion.<br /><br />Faith Severn nee Longley is our narrator, and I believe this is so because she is related in one way or another to all the novel's primary characters, and is of an age, and a position in her family, where her point of view is more objective than most could possibly be, under the circumstances. \\"A Dark Adapted Eye\\" is, above all, the riveting story of a middle class English family during the first half of the 20th century. Thirty years after the fact, Faith, with the assistance of an interested journalist, attempt to piece together the events leading up to a tragic murder which would have profound effects on the entire clan.<br /><br />The Longley family was seemingly united, like many others, with it's temporary dysfunctional moments and happier gatherings and reunions. Faith, along with her parents, John and Vranni Longley lived just outside of London. John's twin sister, Vera Hillyard, was 32 years-old in 1939, and had been caring for their sister Eden, younger by fifteen years, since the girl was 14. The Longley parents were both dead. Vera had lived with her husband, a military man, in India and she come home when her father became ill. Her young son, Francis, had been farmed off to boarding school at age 7. Although they are sisters, Vera acted the mother to Eden and obviously adored her. Faith joined her aunts, and Francis, at their country home, Laurel Cottage, Great Sindon, East Anglia, for holidays. Other relatives, who played an important role in their lives, lived within a relatively close distance. Overall, they appeared to be a group of relatively contented human beings, related by blood and marriage. Yet even Faith, as a young girl, realized that many family stories, and other personal news and events of both little or great importance, were never discussed at home, nor with her aunts. They were all a closed-mouthed, secretive and repressed bunch of folks. The tragedy and drama that was to eventually unfold began during this time, right before WWII.<br /><br />Ms Rendell/Vine quotes James Drevor from The Dictionary of Psychology on the front book leaf prior to the text, \\"Dark Adaptation: a condition of vision brought about progressively by remaining in complete darkness for a considerable period, and characterized by progressive increase in retinal sensitivity.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Vine is a marvel at creating her characters and developing them. Throughout the skillful narrative, it is remarkable to watch individuals change and grow; to observe how they interact with each other and impact each other's lives. The author builds tension from the beginning of her intricate story, and it increases in intensity, almost non-stop, until the book's conclusion. A sinister air permeates parts of the novel when certain characters are front and center, and then lightens-up considerably when others appear on the scene. This deep psychological study, and the manipulative behavior described, are outstanding. It is obvious why the author won The 1986 Edgar Award for her achievements here.

Author Jeff Lindsay's brainstorm to have a psychopathic serial killer as a protagonist - a man driven by his own \\"Dark Passenger\\" to kill, dismember and gift wrap the victim's body parts ever so neatly, never leaving a drop of blood behind, is brilliant. Even more unique, is the author's ability to endear said protagonist, Dexter Morgan, to his readers. Why, Dexter is extremely likeable, sympathetic, even loveable, at times. Women think he's sexy, and his adopted sister dotes on him. He even has a decent sense of humor, dark, of course.<br /><br />Dexter was adopted at the age of three by a cop, Harry Morgan, after an unexplained tragedy orphaned the boy. Harry watched carefully for potential psychopathic behavior from his foster son. Even though the child could not remember what happened to him during his first years, before he became a Morgan family member, his adopted father understood that it would be highly unusual if the child escaped his early experiences unscathed. What occurred before shaped Dexter, no matter how hard Harry tried to straighten him out. So, when Harry discovered that his son, now fourteen years-old, had a history of killing animals, he sat him down for a heart-to-heart. The older man knew that Dexter was really a good boy. Although he is devoid of human feelings, Dexter had learned to fake them quite well in order to fit into society. He sincerely cares what his mother, father and sister Deb, think of him - this is the closest he will ever come to having emotions and feeling love. Harry and Dexter decided that when the need to kill pushed Dexter to look for bigger and better prey, he would learn to channel his urges, control them, and choose his victims carefully, to make sure they would be the scum of the earth - other serial killers, rapists, child molesters, etc.. See, he can murder and dismember to his heart's delight, with every full moon, and still be a good guy??<br /><br />Eventually Harry and his wife die leaving Deb and Dexter on their own. Dexter Morgan is now a highly regarded crime lab technician, specializing in blood spatter analysis for the Miami Police Department, where his sister, Deb, works as a policewoman. She has aspirations to become a homicide detective and get out of vice ASAP, where she presently works, dressing night after night like a flashy hooker, patrolling the worst sections of Tamiami Trail, \\"bait on a sting,\\" catching unsuspecting johns. Dexter is supportive of  Deb and wants to help her achieve her goal. He has assisted her before on cases, as, oddly enough, it is not difficult for him to enter the criminal mind and predict behavior, to the best of his ability. Psychopaths can be helpful to society too.<br /><br />A new kind of serial killer is at work in Miami, who leaves his victims, all hookers, on or near his sister's turf. Dexter, almost always in an apathetic state, becomes fascinated by this monster, who also dismembers his subjects and arranges them in grisly positions. Their modus operands are extremely similar. He feels admiration for his fellow predator and believes the psycho is reaching out to him, trying to tell him something. Dexter is torn between \\"doing the right thing\\" per Harry's long ago instructions, and assisting his sister, or finding the killer to express his sincere admiration at his craftsmanship. There is a third possibility here, one too terrible to contemplate - could this murderer actually be our very own Dexter, performing the deeds during periods of sleep or blackouts?<br /><br />On the downside, Mr. Lindsay's narrative style is overly simplistic, and at times, melodramatic. I don't have the patience to read this kind of dumbed-down prose, no matter how many gruesome car chases are involved in the plot. The author's pop psychology leaves much to be desired, as does any character development one might find in the novel - I couldn't see a three dimensional individual for the life of me. I really cannot understand thisbecause almost all the primary characters have much grist for the mill in terms of background material, their earlier lives. Some really relevant, interesting stuff is covered in just a page or two. I believe Lindsay's second book, \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter,\\" will be out in July 2005. It is not uncommon for series books, which start out quite flawed, to improve greatly with practice. I don't think I will look into Dexter's further adventures, however - not while such brilliant writers as Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine are around to provide really outstanding psychological thrillers. There are just too many superbly written mystery thrillers already on the shelves for me to waste precious time on books which don't make the grade, no matter how original the premise.<br /><br />JANAnderstand this because almost all the primary characters have much grist for the mill in terms of background material, their earlier lives.

I love every single book in the series, except this last one. Anita and her creator couldn't possibly have a bigger fan than I. However, \\"Incubus Dreams\\" is unworthy of our protagonist, her preternatural cohorts, and Ms. Hamilton. It was a huge disappointment for me. After \\"Narcissus In Chains\\" and \\"Cerulean Sins,\\" which are among my favorite Anita novels, I had high expectations for \\"Incubus Dreams,\\" especially since the next book won't be out for another year, and this one has to tide me over. There is just no central plot here. Period! What we have are many sub-plots looking for an anchor. And the scattered mini-storylines aren't even connected.<br /><br />As the novel commences, Anita has achieved the level of master necromancer, enhanced her status as human servant to Jean-Claude, and acquired a vampire servant of her very own, Damian. She is Bolverk of the Thronnos Rokke Clan, Nimir-Ra, (with her own Nimira-Raj - Micah), of the Blooddrinkers Pard. She, Jean-Claude, the Vampire Master, and Werewolf Ulfric, Richard Zeeman, finally married their forces and have become a triumvirate, powerfully tied to one another. Anita merged her blood and her being with two extremely vital creatures, for whom blood lust and sex are major motivators. The two preternaturals took on a touch of Anita's humanity in this exchange, and she, in turn, has become more otherworldly - her sexuality included - especially the part inherited from Jean-Claude. He has within him elements of an incubus, and is able to feed off sexual energy. Anita now has this same capacity and need, called the \\"ardeur.\\" She has become more adept at controlling this drive, although she still needs to have a trusted man around to allow her to feed when the urge overcomes her. And the men who love her appear quite willing to share all of her charms with just about anybody. Now, Laurell Hamilton has caused me to suspend my belief in reality over and over again - but with this premise, she's over the top!! She gives new meaning to the concept \\"to share!!!\\"<br /><br />I want to emphasize that whatever enjoyment one gets from \\"Incubus Dreams\\" depends on a level of familiarity with Anita Blake and those beings she hangs-out with. These are not stand-alone books. Author Hamilton has developed her characters over a period of eleven-plus years, and one should read at least a few of her early works, beginning with \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" before tackling this one.<br /><br />\\"Incubus Dreams'\\" main point, I think, is that the initial triumvirate of Anita, Jean-Claude and Richard finally merge \\"all the way\\" - yes, they take the final step, except for the fourth mark. Richard acquiesces to a menage. Thus their joint powers and abilities have increased manyfold, but none of them know just how much yet, nor how strong they have actually become individually. The three, unknowingly, also exchanged personality traits when they merged. Richard now sometimes sounds like Anita when he speaks - especially his new sarcasm. Anita and Richard have become more practical and laid-back, a gift from Jean-Claude, and our Master Vamp has become more human and sensitive - just a tad. Asher, who was a major character in the last novel is nowhere to be found here - and he comprised a significant part of a threesome with Anita and Jean-Claude. Has he been dispatched so easily after such an important role? OK. Just a question, now back to the major point of \\"Incubus,\\" (IMHO). Since most of the city's vampires are from Belle' Mort's line, they are beautiful and seductive - but by no means are they powerful warriors. If a strong master vampire, and contingent, challenge Jean-Claude as Master of St. Louis, they probably would have the forces to defeat him - thereby endangering the city's lycanthrope population and Anita, who are allies of Jean-Claude's. Therefore Jean-Claude needs to acquire warriors of his own, although this new more powerful merger of the triumvirate will assist him significantly.<br /><br />It take over 600 pages to make this point. On these pages, Anita participates in more threesomes then I care to enumerate. She forms another triumvirate, which I believes lessens the importance of her relationship with Richard and Jean-Claude, and/or Jean-Claude and Asher. Then she couples with guys I don't even know, and neither does she. I don't understand why these disposable characters have been added. I do not know what purpose they serve, other than to cater to Anita's \\"ardeur,\\" and she already has more than enough known men chomping at the bit, willing to help her out here. She also sleeps with vampires and lycanthropes to prevent them from dying. Give me a break!! There is just too much written about too many recently introduced folks I don't care about, and not enough info about those already developed in prior books. And so much physical intimacy, of the gratuitous kind, is boring and not at all sensual.<br /><br />There is also a serial murderer on the loose - a vampire is killing strippers and lap dancers - so what else is new? However, this sub-plot only takes up a few chapters, and is given such short shrift, that I wonder at its inclusion.<br /><br />I am rating the book 3 Stars - not less - because I could probably read pure trash if Anita, Richard, Jean-Claude, etc., were included in the cast. I am addicted. Also, Laurell Hamilton's classic dark humor is prevalent throughout and she is funnier than usual. I really liked the scenes with the above three characters, the initial triumvirate. I will now go through withdrawal waiting a year - or more  for the continuation. If you're a fan of Anita Blake's and have kept up with the series, you will probably want to read this, although you may not enjoy it as much as the other novels. One can just as easily skip this one and not miss much.<br />JANAwill assist him significantly.     It take over 600 pages to make this point.

These are amazing novels, but I want to emphasize that the degree of enjoyment one gets from them depends on a level of familiarity with Anita Blake and cohorts. These are not stand-alone books. Author Hamilton has developed her characters over a period of eleven-plus years, and one should read at least a few of her early works, beginning with \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" before tackling \\"Cerulean Sins.\\" Action-packed and plot driven though the books may be, knowledge of the characters, and their growth, is essential for maximum appreciation.<br /><br />\\"Narcissus In Chains,\\" the novel prior to this one, was a pivotal point in the series, where some tension, built over a long period, was relieved and crucial decisions were made concerning the direction of Ms. Blake's life. Anita achieved the level of master necromancer, enhanced her status as human servant to Jean-Claude, and acquired a vampire servant of her very own, Damian. She has also become Bolverk of the Thronnos Rokke Clan, Nimir-Ra, (with her own Nimira-Raj - Micah), of the Blooddrinkers Pard, and a lycanthrope politician, of sorts. Anita, Jean-Claude, the Vampire Master, and Werewolf Ulfric, Richard Zeeman, finally married their forces and have become a triumvirate, powerfully tied to one another. Anita merged her blood and her being with two extremely vital creatures, for whom blood lust and sex are major motivators. The two preternaturals took on a touch of Anita's humanity in this exchange, and she, in turn, has become more otherworldly - her sexuality included - especially the part inherited from Jean-Claude. He has within him elements of an incubus, and is able to feed off sexual energy. Anita now has this same capacity and need, called the \\"ardeur.\\" She is not able to control this drive yet and needs to have a trusted man around to allow her to feed when the urge overcomes her. Needless to say, the concept of monogamy is kaput, at least for the time being. She also possesses an inner-beast, as does Richard. Her ability to deal with an overabundance of additional superhuman features is just another stage in her development. Laurell Hamilton has made a courageous decision to take her protagonist over the dangerous terrain she now travels. She is definitely pushing the envelope. This is a crossroads for Blake fans, as well as for Ms. Blake. Ultimately Anita had to deal with making a decision about Jean-Claude and Richard, and either accept her growing preternaturalism, the merger and its consequences, or look for another career.<br /><br />\\"Cerulean Sins\\" begins in a relatively low-keyed manner. Leo Harlan, a new client whose job description reads \\"assassin\\" meets with Anita and hires her to raise a dead ancestor for genealogical purposes. Hah! That same evening she has cemetery duty, to reanimate a man thought to have been a suicide. For insurance purposes, Anita needs to interview the corpse with a  judge, insurance agent, former wife, and various others as witnesses to determine whether the family is entitled to receive insurance money. Vampire Asher, second-in-command to Jean-Claude, arrives as the zombie-raising ceremony is concluding. A major emergency has arisen - so what else is new?<br /><br />Belle Mort, the 2000 year-old fountainhead, \\"le sourdre de sang,\\" of Jean-Claude's and Asher's bloodline, and member of the all powerful Council of Vampires, had scheduled a visit to St. Louis for three months in the future. The Master of the City, and everyone connected to him, are responsible for wining, dining, (she thrives on blood, sex and fear), and doing everything possible for La Belle Mort and her entourage. Displeasing her could mean death or serious long-term torture. However, no one is allowed to harm this Queen of vamps - no matter what she does. She is their mother and their liege lady. Mussette, one of her lieutenants, has arrived early, on purpose, to wreck havoc.Mussette has some unreasonable demands, (of course), including the return of Asher to Europe and La Belle's lair. The only way he can be saved is for him to become the third member of a menage which includes Anita and Jean-Claude. Hmmm. What will Anita, the former Miss Priss decide?<br /><br />On another front, a series of hideous murders are being committed in St. Louis, and although Anita has been called to work the case, her longtime mentor and former dear friend Lt. Dolph Storr, seems to hate her for her intimate contact with the preternatural set, especially the vampires. Then problems arise with Richard, and the allegiance of his werewolves, whose back-up is especially needed during the visit of Belle Morte and Mussette. The action is totally non-stop, as are the multitude of conflicts and dilemmas Anita must confront in her personal life.<br /><br />Laurell Hamilton is one of the best storytellers around. I have now read eleven Anita books, and I rarely read series novels. The plots are spectacular. The labyrinthine vampire and lycanthrope politics makes US election brouhahas look like child's play. The characters are some of the most fascinating and complex that I have encountered in fantasy fiction. They have all grown and changed tremendously since book #1. The author's humor is often dark, but hilarious. I can't wait to read \\"Incubus Dreams,\\" the 12th and last published Anita Blake novel. On the other hand, I am reluctant to begin it, because the 13th book won't be out until 2006.

Author Monica Bohm-Duchen delves into eight famous works of art, and the lives of their creators, for \\"The Private Life Of A Masterpiece.\\" She explores here the popularity of these masterworks. What has caused them to move so many viewers so deeply? The stories behind their creation and the history of each one, along with corresponding information about their respective artists, are also discussed. Dating from 1501 to 1950, the artworks selected are: Michelangelo's \\"David\\"; Leonardo's \\"Mona Lisa\\";  Francisco de Goya's \\"Third of May, 1808,\\" Edouard Manet's \\"Olympia,\\" Vincent Van Gogh's \\"Sunflowers,\\" Edvard Munch's \\"Scream\\"; and two 20th-century paintings, Pablo Picasso's \\"Demoiselles d'Avignon\\" and Jackson Pollock's \\"Autumn Rhythm.\\" In all, there are 150 black and white photographs and 10 line illustrations in this 240 page book - a real gem for any art lover to treasure. The principal commonality in the pieces chosen for the publication, apart from being well known art icons, is that all eight strike resounding chords within viewers worldwide.<br /><br />Each painting, and the \\"David,\\" have their own, in-depth biography. Ms. Bohm-Duchen's rich analytical narrative is what makes this volume so special. This is not a dry text at all. As a matter if fact, I found it to be a real page-turner. The author has thoroughly researched every piece, and writes fascinating commentary on their creation. I was especially intrigued by the text documenting the various methods the artists used to prepare and execute their work. Also, of particular interest are the historical art reviews - how the finished masterpieces were received by the public. For example, when Manet's painting \\"Olympia\\" was hung in the Salon of Paris in 1865, it was met with jeers, laughter and disdain by art critics, the public, and the newspapers. Manet was rebelling against the art establishment of the time, and Ms. Bohm-Duchen explains that by painting a real woman, a courtesan at that, instead of an idealized version of  \\"woman,\\" and by disregarding the paths forged by the great masters, Manet greatly shocked viewers. Tidbits like these may not be absolutely necessary for an understanding of art, but the wealth of material the author provides certainly enhanced my appreciation and enjoyment.<br /><br />Beautifully written and presented, I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys fine art.<br /><br />JANAzed version of  \\"woman,\\" and by disregarding the paths forged by the great masters, Manet greatly shocked viewers.

The author consistently sets a high standard of authenticity, especially in terms of what life is about growing up in the projects and on the mean streets, where the sub-culture and economy of illegal substances are always good for a lift. Without making apologies or excuses, Pelecanos is the rare writer who enables readers to empathize, at times, with even the most hardcore criminal - although there is an unusually nasty human predator here.<br /><br />Derek Strange, is a black, middle class, middle-aged man, a former cop and a successful private investigator. Although tough, his heart is in the right place. Derek has worked before with Irish ex-cop, turned PI,  Terry Quinn, in \\"Right As Rain.\\" The two detectives hook up again in \\"Hell to Pay,\\" to find a fourteen year-old girl who has run away from her home in middle class suburbia, and is determined to be the star hooker for one of DC's most vicious \\"handlers.\\" The two are interrupted, mid-investigation, by the merciless drive-by shooting of one of the neighborhood kids. The boy, ten-year Joe Wilder, was a most promising member of the peewee football team that Strange and Quinn coach. He was also a good candidate for life outside the projects. Devastated by the death, and the feelings the loss triggers, Strange becomes a man on a mission to personally take down the killers.<br /><br />Pelecanos delves into the private lives of both Strange and Quinn, which makes for a richer narrative, and gives the reader more insight into these two protagonists. Derek has a long-term relationship with Janine, his office manager. Although the two love each other, Strange, who has a settled life, and is committed to help his community's young black men make good futures for themselves, is unable to commit to a monogamous relationship. Janine's teenage son, Lionel, to whom Derek feels very close, points out that he doesn't want to get too tight with a man who might be gone tomorrow. The volatile Quinn, a loner who has never had a successful relationship with a woman, meets Sue Tracy, of Bagley and Tracy Investigative Services, \\"Specializing in Locating and Retrieving Minors.\\" Quinn feels strongly enough for Sue that he is willing to try breaking his track record. The new couple could make it, with lots of work. Quinn also needs to deal with his hair-trigger temper and not so latent racism.<br /><br />The clear, straightforward writing is outstanding, but the pace does not pick-up speed until near the conclusion. The tension is there from the beginning, however, and builds in intensity. This is as much a character-driven novel as plot-driven, thus the slower momentum. I find it a plus. The author has an ear for street talk that just brings conversations to life. His dialogues are unlike any other. Sometimes when the characters are back-and-forthing, especially about music, there is almost a rap-like rhythm to the prose. The narrative is imbued with a certain nostalgia. Someone is always remembering the old neighborhoods and the way things used to be, (for better or worse), going back to the Vietnam War and the riots in the 1960s. This is real icing on the cake, which few can deliver like George Pelecanos.

Suskind's beautifully crafted narrative excites the imagination and expands the reader's senses - especially that least appreciated of faculties, the olfactory. John E. Woods should be lauded for bringing the richness and texture of the author's language to his English translation. \\"Perfume\\" is much more than a murder mystery or suspense thriller. It is an extraordinary tale that defies genre classification.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born in the most squalid, stinking marketplace of 18th-century Paris, perhaps even the most putrid place in all France, on July 17, 1738. And, as the author explains, the stench of 18th-century Paris is one that modern man cannot begin to fathom - manure, moldering wood, rat droppings, human excretions both common and exotic, caustic lyes and sulfur from the tanneries, congealed blood from the slaughterhouses, the great unwashed masses, spoiled and rotting food, etc., etc.. His mother, who suffered from \\"gout, syphilis and a touch of consumption,\\" was otherwise healthy. She was not concerned when her labor began. She had delivered four other babies beneath her fish booth, all illegitimate, and disposed of all four, along with the bloody refuse of fish and entrails at the end of the market day. Amoral, she had no idea she was doing wrong, nor did she particularly care. Jean-Baptiste was fortunate. He cried lustily at birth, thus calling sufficient attention to himself, that his mother was forced to acknowledge him. The baby boy was allowed to live. Taken in by the church, he was placed in the care of a wet nurse.<br /><br />In the novel's wonderful first paragraph, Suskind introduces John-Baptiste. \\"In eighteenth-century France there lived a man who was one of the most gifted and abominable personages in an era that knew no lack of gifted and abominable personages. His name was Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and if his name - in contrast to the names of other gifted abominations, de Sade's, for instance, or Saint-Just's, Fouche's, Bonaparte's, etc. - has been forgotten today, it is not because Grenouille fell short of those more famous blackguards when it came to arrogance, misanthropy, immorality, or, more succinctly, to wickedness, because his gifts and his sole ambition were restricted to a domain that leaves no traces in history: to the fleeting realm of scent.\\"<br /><br />Grenouille had no scent of his own - absolutely no odor. This was a terrible handicap which caused all to shun him from infancy, without understanding why they avoided him. However, in a bizarre attempt to balance this aberration, nature provided Jean-Baptiste with the most acute sense of smell of any human that ever lived. At an early age, he was able to clearly distinguish differences in people with his eyes closed. He knew the different scents of wood, which he had to chop everyday, and even which of a variety of cows provided the milk he drank each morning. He spent his every waking hour identifying, ordering and classifying scent. This extraordinary olfactory gift, and his passion to pursue, capture and distill all scents, were to be the cause of his unforeseeable elevation in society, which rarely recognized one of his lowly class, and also, his ultimate downfall. Mr. Suskind chronicles here Grenouille's life - from his stint at the home of Madame Gaillard, who took in orphans like Jean-Baptiste, to his arduous apprenticeship with the tanner Grimal, his work with the famous perfumer Baldini, where he became a journeyman perfumer, and his wanderings throughout all Paris to learn the city's every smell. He aspired to become the omnipotent god of scent. He knew that the person \\"who ruled scent also ruled the hearts of men,\\" for \\"scent was the brother of breath.\\" Then came the day he discovered the single most exquisite scent of all, which he became obsessed to possess for his own.<br /><br />Grenouille had never known love or the slightest affection, not even a tender touch. No one  educated him about right and wrong, and he had no inherent ability to distinguish between good and evil. From the earliest age, he did what was necessaey to survive. He was truly a man with no conscience - totally narcissistic. Morality played no part in his life - the pursuit of scent was all that gave him joy. It is to Patrick Suskind's credit that I felt such empathy for this creature. I don't excuse his behavior, but given his background and life, how else could he have been expected to turn out?<br /><br />\\"Perfume's\\" various settings are illustrated, and the characters depicted, as Jean-Baptiste would perceive them, through smell. The descriptions are so vivid, and the use of language so bountiful, that I found myself reading passages aloud at times, just to savor the words. The historic detail is meticulous and fascinating, as is the process of perfume making, much of which is described here. This is a compelling tale, that is surreal, almost otherworldly. It is also a chilling portrait of a psychopath with a mission. The conclusion is brilliant, unexpected and riveting.

I thought the combination of suspense thriller set against a raging hurricane would make for an ideal read. Also, this novel has received consistent praise from Amazon customers - so what could be bad? Plenty!! The plot is simplistic, almost kitschy at times, especially the conclusion. There is no complex mystery, as a matter of fact, it is fairly clear who the bad guys are from the beginning, as it is what they are after and why. Subplots, chilling twists and turns in the narrative, are virtually nonexistent. The number of convenient coincidences that occur, just as it appears all is lost, render the story incredible. Mr. Stewart's characters are even less complex than the storyline. He does not develop them, and their only motivations seem to be either greed or survival - not exactly a wide range. They express little emotion, whether in fear, grief or even in the throes of passion. In a word, \\"Hurricane's\\" characters are flat! Most of all, the description of the storm is weak, to say the least - not at all what I expected. And I am extremely disappointed.<br /><br />Julie Tanaka, and her daughter Meiko, are living aboard their boat in Trinidad. For those interested in boating, especially sailing, we don't even learn what kind of ship they own - although, I would assume that with a jib, staysail and main mast it is a sloop. Right?? They are abruptly advised by local authorities that their husband, and father, has been blown-up along with the boat he was delivering to California. Drugs are involved. There is barely time for a shocked silence and a tear or two, when a process server comes along to tell them that they have been left with considerable debt, and he will take possession of their boat ASAP - thank you very much. Enter Bill Broxton, DEA agent, to save the day...until he learns he has been slandered, framed and is wanted for murder, among other things. He's in worse shape than Julie and Meiko! Obviously, the two women have to leave the island before they lose their boat. And Braxton better get out of town fast also. All this sounds more exciting in theory than it actually reads in fiction.<br /><br />I will say that my interest was peaked enough to stick with the story. I do love sailing, boats, the ocean and, as I previously mentioned, violent storms. So, there was, for me, some grist for the mill here. I have been through more than a few hurricanes in my life, but the book didn't add much to my knowledge. The descriptions are fairly basic - and although I didn't expect anything near the level of Sebastian Junger's \\"The Perfect Storm,\\" I did want more than was delivered. The book is not a total loss, however, and would probably make for some good entertainment on a plane flight, or in a hotel room late at night.

The descriptions are fairly basic - and although I didn't expect anything near the level of Sebastian Junger's \\"The Perfect Storm,\\" I did want more than was delivered. The book is not a total loss, however, and would probably make for some good entertainment on a plane flight, or in a hotel room late at night. However, don't look for a 4 or 5 star read here. <br />JANA	2005-04-01

The metallic taste of the rain is pleasing to Natalie, which is one of the reasons she likes to walk in the Portland drizzle. Radio static is now preferable to music, which grates. Bright lights, \\"florescent, flickering so fast no one could tell they weren't steady,\\" provide the ambiance she likes most. She is pure adrenaline - electric - awake all night. Tang - orange flavored water really - fruit roll-ups and beef jerky comprise her diet. She can't remember the last time she ate fresh fruit and vegetables, but likes canned produce, with the slight aftertaste of metal. Home is a lopsided trailer supported by sinking cinderblocks, surrounded by clumps of crabgrass, old bottle caps and scraps of paper, located off a dirt road. Most of all, Natalie is obsessed with Playboy Playmates from the year 1976. She knows their bios by heart, can mimic their photographic poses. That Bicentennial year was a memorable one for the then 12-year-old girl. Now, however, \\"Forgetfulness disconnected the past from the future, took her in a different direction, and she suspected that was not something she could always deny. For the temptation was not to remember, to really forget, to embrace her best days....moving forward, her energy multiplying, never lapsing.\\"<br /><br />Kayla, Leon and Chris skateboard beneath the Burnside Bridge in Portland, Oregon. They are best friends, have been since fourth grade when they were selected for a gifted student program. Now, at fifteen, they have been inseparable for over five years. They study languages, classical music and play instruments. Kayla is a whiz-kid in math and science, just as she excels, with her sensuous grace, on the skateboard. She is especially fascinated with electricity. Chris is best at literature and history. Leon is good at everything. The three attempt to be intellectually dispassionate, all the while feeling the intense, ever changing emotions of adolescence. They look with disdain at their peers, and what they consider to be the superficial lives of most adults. All three are desperate to figure out a way to live together, \\"...somewhere, and they would live in a way that no one had lived before...\\"<br /><br />Natalie sees Kayla skateboarding one evening and is transfixed by the girl's agility and skill. She approaches Kayla and, after a strange conversation about Playboy's 1976 July Playmate, asks the girl to help her with a special project. Natalie will pay well for copper wire stolen from electrical lines located outside the city. Kayla agrees to do the scavenging if her two friends can be included. The teens already have a purpose for the money, and Natalie fits their image of \\"an especially promising person\\" - an off-beat nonconformist. They're psyched. And thus begins a bizarre, chilling, and ultimately dangerous affiliation.<br /><br />\\"The Bewildered\\" is a riveting novel - pardon the pun, but it is electrifying!! The author's depiction of the three teenagers is on target. They are all three-dimensional, vivid, believable characters. Mr. Rock captures Leon's, Kayla's and Chris' joy for life, their intensity and idealism, their language and the loyalty they share for one another. He also provides insight into their distinct personalities and the growing awareness of their sexuality, which could ultimately divide them.<br /><br />Natalie is at once bizarre, erratic, yet terribly canny and willing to use others for her own ends, no matter the cost. The other characters are equally eccentric, and with good reason. Steven, the sailor, knew Natalie before, in another lifetime; Victor Elias Machado - an ex-con on post-prison supervision for attempted sexual abuse. Was he guilty or unjustly sentenced because he is one of the Affected? Chesterton, who is obsessed, studying a hidden world and those who populate it in his office at the Shanghai Shanghai in Chinatown. He looks \\"to access what is most electric in us, most alive.\\"<br /><br />Rock's landscapes are at times fantastical, surreal. The description of the kids skateboarding through the deserted Portland zoo late at night is phenomenal. His narrative is strong and tightly written. This is a most original, atmospheric novel that will stay with you long after you finish it. Highly recommended.<br /><br />JANAtastical, surreal.

Maybury was known to have been in financial difficulties. His wine business, funded by his wife, which he ran from the cellars of her estate, was virtually bankrupt. It was widely believed that Maybury physically abused Phoebe, although she excused her often bruised face as the result of clumsiness, falls, etc.. After ten days with no sign of the man, the police searched the Grange and the surrounding wood thoroughly, even digging up the Maybury's extensive gardens - to no avail. An overly zealous detective questioned Pheobe to the point of harassment. He also implied she was responsible for her parents death in an auto accident a few years before. Finally the unsolved Maybury mystery was laid to rest in the cold case files.<br /><br />Ten years later Pheobe Maybury, now in her mid-thirties, is still living at her elegant country home, along with her two best friends from childhood, Anne Catrell, a journalist, and Diana Goode, an interior decorator. The three women are shunned by local society, and much maligned - believed to be witches, lesbians, or both. When a badly decomposed corpse is found in the estate's ice house, two cynical detectives arrive at the scene to investigate. The nightmare of ten years before begins anew. Detective Chief Inspector Walsh was originally in charge of the missing husband case, years ago. He has never lost his conviction that Pheobe murdered David, and is sure the unidentifiable body must be his. It appears Walsh, with the one-track mind, has his own agenda. Detective Sergeant Andy McLoughlin, a charismatic but troubled man, looks at the clues, both recent and past, along with the various testimonies and begins to take a different view from his superior's. To arrive at the truth, however, he must examine his own demons and motivations.<br /><br />Author Minette Walters won the John Creasey Award for Best First Crime Novel with \\"The Ice House.\\" This unputdownable mystery is richly deserving of the prize and much praise. Phoebe, Anne and Diana are complex characters and their relationships with each other, and with the two detectives, really make the book special - a delightful  and thrilling read. I was very much taken with the characters, more so than usual, and cared very much what happened to them. There is much more than a murder mystery, or two, or three, going on in this suspenseful novel. There are unexpected twists and turns along with a number of fascinating subplots.

Cordelia Hopkins makes a living finding lost people. She and her beautiful bloodhound, Greta, have a terrific track record for leading successful search-and-rescue missions. They're very good at what they do. As \\"Vanishing Acts\\" progresses, it becomes obvious that Delia has had an unusually intense interest in loss, of both people and memory, stemming from her third year of life.<br /><br />Raised by her warm and loving father, Andrew, Delia had as happy a childhood as anyone could wish for. Her dad, a widower, was always right there for her. She could talk to him about anything...and she still can, she believes. Sometimes, she would think about what it would be like to have a mother and fantasize about meeting her in heaven. Her mom died in a car crash when she was a small child. On the other hand, it seems to Cordelia that she and her father have lived forever in the same cozy house in rural New Hampshire, just the two of them. He has run a local senior center there for as long as she can remember, and has always been active in community affairs. Although she has vague memories of a woman who smelled of vanilla and apples, Delia remembers almost nothing of her life prior to Wexton, NH.<br /><br />Her two next door neighbors are her two best friends and have been for most of her thirty-two years. She grew up with both of them. Eric Talcott, her fiance, is the father of her pre-school daughter, Sophie. They are in the process of planning their wedding. Fitzwilliam MacMurray, (Fitz), formed the other part of their triumvirate from the time they were little kids. They were a \\"fungible\\" trio, as Fitz once put it. In high school, when Eric and Delia fell in love, the three-way friendship continued and still does, years later.  Eric is now a lawyer, and Fitz a journalist.<br /><br />As Sophie grows from a toddler to little girl, Delia begins to remember more about her own life at her daughter's age. Images, sounds, the feel of the sun on her head, bring back fragmented memories from another time - people, voices and a place she just cannot identify. Then one evening a policeman knocks on the door with a warrant for her father's arrest, and her life and world are turned upside down.<br /><br />\\"Vanishing Act\\" is written in the first person by each of five main characters: Delia, Andrew, Eric, Fitz, and  Elise. Each point of view provides part of the puzzle that is the history of the Hopkins' family. I am a big fan of the author's and have never disliked any of her novels. There are some books by Jodi Picoult which I love, and others I would prefer not to read twice. \\"Vanishing Acts\\" is in the latter category, and is probably the book I like least by Ms. Picoult. The narrative feels forced, even erratic at times, and disturbs the natural flow which usually marks the author's work. She has added unwarranted drama, which fits neither the storyline nor the characters. There are scenes from prison life that, although fascinating, are tremendously distracting and excessively violent - to no purpose. Certain characters, dialogue and scenarios are just out of place and make an otherwise believable plot incredible. Unnecessary touches, like change of font and the use of boldface type to distinguish between characters' stories and chapters, are also awkward. It is as if the author could not count on the strength of her plot and storytelling ability to sustain the novel, and needed to go for the artsy effect to provide a worthy result.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are people who surface here, like the Native American woman, Ruthann, who is a jewel of a character - and a prime example of what Jodi Picoult fans look for when we purchase her novels without a second's thought. I am glad I read the book. I would have been sorry to miss it. However, read parts of it in a bookstore before you decide to make a purchase. Otherwise, wait for it to come out in paperback or go to the library.<br /><br />JANAragmented memories from another time - people, voices and a place she just cannot identify.

At this somewhat late date in life, I thought it about time I explore Ms. Rendell's mysteries, and her psychological thrillers, which receive such rave reviews. \\"From Doon With Death\\" was my recent introduction to the author's work. I believe in starting at the beginning. Now I understand what all the fanfare is about. This is an excellent mystery - and it is only her first effort. I know she has matured greatly as a writer in the forty plus years since she published this book in 1964. I look forward to following her development as a writer as I continue to read her books, authored under the name of Barbara Vine, as well as Ruth Rendell.<br /><br />Margaret Parsons and her husband of six years, Ronald, have  recently moved to Kingsmarkham in Sussex. They are a happily married, rather introverted couple, and keep to themselves most of the time. Although Margaret is a lay preacher at the local Methodist Church, and has some acquaintances there, the two have not made any friends yet. They are definitely not wealthy and live a very frugal existence. Ronald works for the Southern Water Board at Stowerton and Margaret is a homemaker, a good one too. Their large, ugly house, is not well constructed, nor does it have a refrigerator, washing machine or other modern conveniences. It does contain, however, a small but very expensive collection of Victorian literature and poetry, bound in suede, scented leather and watered silk. All are inscribed, on the fly leaves, from Doon to Minna, and the messages are personal, romantic, and intense, to say the least.<br /><br />At the book's beginning, a frantic Ronald Parsons telephones Inspector Mike Burden, a neighbor, to tell him that his wife hasn't come home that evening. The body of the thirty-two year-old woman, is found the next day, strangled in a near-by wood. She had left home with only her keys and purse, not even her coat. When the valuable book collection is discovered in a trunk in the attic, the investigation take on a new nature. Who are Minna and Doon? And who was Margaret Parsons?<br /><br />Although the seemingly prim and proper Mrs. Parsons is dead when the story begins, the author paints a vivid portrait of the victim in retrospect, through the testimonies of those questioned in connection to the crime. Chief Inspector Wexford, with his countrified ways and off-beat humor, is a meticulous detective, if somewhat eccentric. Inspector Burden, also very competent, makes a wonderful straightman and side-kick. The narrative is taut, the characters diverse and original, and the mystery suspenseful. I couldn't figure out who did it. Ms. Rendell also writes a scathing commentary about the idle rich. This is a book that stands the test of time and continues to rivet its readers.

It is, however, a thrilling psychological study of a rapist, Victor Jenner, who suffers from chorea, a disease of the nervous system marked by involuntary, jerky movements of the arms, legs, and/or face. Sometimes this illness is called \\"live flesh.\\" Victor also has a severe phobia of tortoises, along with a multitude of other neuroses. Throughout the novel, he feels a need for psychiatric treatment, but never follows through. Typically, he blames the system for not providing him with therapy. He does understand that he has serious problems, though, and more often than not knows the difference between right and wrong. The inimitable Ruth Rendell thoroughly explores Jenner's motives, secrets, and complex emotions. She paints a chilling portrait of a man doomed by violence he cannot control. This is obviously much more a book driven by characters, and their development, than by action. The heart of \\"Live Flesh\\" lies in the complexity of Victor Jenner's personality and how he interacts with others, two characters in particular. These people are all steeped in a web of consequences stemming from one single event, a gunshot, which alters their lives forever.<br /><br />Victor Jenner was convicted of shooting a young police officer in the lower back and permanently crippling him. He had been holding a young woman hostage in her bedroom, after breaking and entering her home, while escaping from the scene of an attempted rape. David Fleetwood, the officer, had been trying to gain the woman's release. Victor was not tried for the attempted rape, or the numerous other acts of sexual violence he had successfully committed. The police probably had no idea he was responsible for the crimes. After ten years Jenner is released early, for good behavior. He has serious problems adjusting to life after incarceration. But then, he always had problems adjusting. His irrational thought processes cause him to blame everyone but himself for the events leading up to the shooting. Underneath, however, he feels tremendous guilt for giving in to his irresistible urges which cause so much harm to others. The author allows the reader to enter Jenner's mind, his very thoughts, throughout the novel. He constantly constructs false scenarios which absolve him of guilt. Primary among his rationalizations is that if David Fleetwood had not taunted him by saying that the gun was a fake, a replica, then he wouldn't have had to fire it in order to prove that it was real. Other rationalizations include: if the girl hadn't screamed, then he wouldn't have had to hold her hostage; and if his uncle hadn't owned a gun, which he had easy access to, he never would have had it in his possession. Victor is also firmly convinced that he is incapable of restraining himself because of the chorea, which acts up when he is stressed. He believes that his behavior is as blameless and uncontrollable as the involuntary twitching which torments him.<br /><br />The plot takes an unusual twist when Victor looks to meet the man he maimed, now wheelchair bound. His delusions allow him to think that, for the first time in his life, he has found true friendship. I must say that I really empathized with Victor, right up until the conclusion - which is a stunning one. His crimes are heinous, but so is the life he has to live with himself. I don't absolve him. I just feel terribly sorry for him - which is all Ms. Rendell's doing. Her characters are rich and so believable. And her narrative is spellbinding. This is a brilliant analysis and portrayal of a deranged man.<br />JANAhe events leading up to the shooting.

Twenty-nine year-old Karen Lowens is HIV-positive. The disease is in its final stages, but she will probably die by lethal injection before AIDS takes it course. Karen is on Death Row in the Mountain View facility, Gatestown, Texas, awaiting her execution. It won't be long now. She is a convicted serial killer. Her victims, all johns - all but one, were mostly truckers. So many had taken more than the pound of flesh they had paid her for. Lowens had been beaten, abused, and broken so many times - torn-up internally by the constant pounding against her flesh. The horror began the first time her mother sold her for drug money at age twelve. Unfortunately, one evening, Harry Mills, an innocent man and all around nice guy, bumped into Karen's rage in a convenience store. She shot him dead. Although Lowens resists any close connection with her fellow prisoners, she is curious about a new inmate, Sharleen, who has just become a member of this exclusive cellblock. She was dubbed the Satan Killer by the media. \\"Karen thinks about things to say to Sharleen. She wants to tell her that she is not alone in knowing what it feels like to tear through human life. She wants to tell Sharleen that hatred ebbs to a steady ache.....Sharleen, she does not say, there is joy in breathing out, knowing you can breathe in again.\\"<br /><br />Twenty-nine year-old Franny Wren is a doctor, trained in some of the country's finest universities and hospitals. Orphaned at a young age, her Uncle Jack, a physician, took her in after her parents' death, and made sure she wanted for nothing. Fran has just lost a patient - one she had became extremely attached to. Anna Gillison, a precocious little girl was cancer-ridden when Dr. Wren took over her case. She was able to persuade the child's parents to allow a brutally painful bone transplant - a long-shot - rather than let Anna die peacefully in her own bed. The child died in terrible pain, not at all in peace. \\"'I don't think I can do this,' Anna had said. 'Can I let go now?' And, 'Will everything be here when I am gone?'\\" Franny is devastated, guilt-ridden and beyond sorrow. In this fragile state, just after Anna's funeral, she is informed of her uncle's death. She leaves New York City for Gatesville, Texas, her childhood home, to make funeral arrangements.<br /><br /> Celia Mills is a young widow unable to move-on with her life. Henry, her husband, best friend and beloved companion left the house, five years before, for a six-pack. An innocent bystander at a hold-up, he was shot, murdered. He never returned to Celia. In a sense, Celia never returned to herself either.<br /><br />Three women's lives converge in the stifling heat of a Texas summer. They have followed remarkably different paths in life, but all three share the commonality of intense emotional pain and loss.  Amanda Eyre Ward treats her characters tenderly, with compassion, sensitivity and gentle humor. She also gives the reader an unflinching look at these women, while exploring the sanctity of life, their wavering spirituality, and the events which will impact all three dramatically. Celia's voice is the only one we hear first-hand. The others' stories are told in the omniscient third person. This variation is an effective tool for developing the readers attachments and sympathies, I think. Ms. Ward's prose is luminous. I read her second novel, \\"How To Be Lost,\\" (also highly recommended!), and was so impressed that I immediately picked up a copy of \\"Sleep Toward Heaven.\\" I am not disappointed.

In spite of some critics' views, I think \\"Narcissus In Chains\\" is one of the best books in the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series. I want to emphasize that the degree of enjoyment one gets from this novel depends on more than a basic familiarity with Anita Blake and cohorts. Author Laurell Hamilton has developed her characters in ten books, (up until this one), over a period of eleven years. Action-packed and plot driven though the books may be, knowledge of the characters and their growth is essential before beginning this one. The series now reaches a pivotal point, in which tension, built over a long period, must be relieved and crucial decisions made. \\"Narcissus In Chains\\" is definitely not a stand-on-its-own novel. Nor is it just one in a long series of action thrillers.<br /><br />Anita achieves the level of master (mistress?) necromancer here, enhances her status as human servant to Jean-Claude and acquires a vampire servant of her very own. She also becomes Bolverk of the Thronnos Rokke Clan, Nimir-Ra, (with her own Nimira-Raj), of the Blooddrinkers Pard, and a lycanthrope politician, of sorts. Now, there are those who complain that their heroine has been besmirched by a now voracious sexual appetite. Granted, there is much more sex here, of a graphic nature, than in the previous books. And I understand that this may be offensive to some. However, the series evolves and Anita is a big girl, but no longer a totally human one - if she ever has been. She has long struggled over her fear of intimacy, emotional and sexual. She took relatively small steps from a somewhat tentative sexual relationship with Richard, to another less tentative one with Jean-Claude. All the while her supernatural strengths and skills were increasing. Now the three powers merge - the master necromancer, Anita, Jean-Claude, Vampire Master and Werewolf Ulfric, Richard, marry their forces and become a triumvirate, powerfully tied to one another. Anita merges her blood and her being with two extremely vital creatures, for whom blood lust and sex are major motivators. The two preternaturals take on a touch of Anita's humanity in this exchange, and she, in turn, becomes more otherworldly - her sexuality included - especially the part inherited from Jean-Claude. She now possesses an inner-beast, as does Richard. Her ability to deal with an overabundance of additional superhuman features is just another stage in her development. Laurell Hamilton has made a courageous decision to take her protagonist over the dangerous terrain she now travels. She is definitely pushing the envelope.

The two preternaturals take on a touch of Anita's humanity in this exchange, and she, in turn, becomes more otherworldly - her sexuality included - especially the part inherited from Jean-Claude. She now possesses an inner-beast, as does Richard. Her ability to deal with an overabundance of additional superhuman features is just another stage in her development. Laurell Hamilton has made a courageous decision to take her protagonist over the dangerous terrain she now travels. She is definitely pushing the envelope.

Henri Cartier-Bresson, a man who elevated photography to an art form, is known for successfully capturing \\"decisive,\\" but elusive, moments on film - photographs taken at the instant when \\"visual harmony and human significance coalesce.\\" His famous photograph of a man jumping over a puddle (\\"Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare, 1932\\") illustrates this concept perfectly. Perhaps Cartier-Bresson's unique gift for combining the plastic arts with the images he saw through the camera's lens was acquired through his early training as a painter in his native France.<br /><br />A renowned photojournalist, he began his career in 1931 and purchased his first Leica in 1932. He was one of the first to shoot in the 35 mm format, and was an innovator of the \\"street photography\\" which was to influence generations of photographers. During his decades long career he worked all over the world and photographed such luminaries as Matisse, Picasso, Coco Chanel, Truman Capote, and Gandhi. His interest in the visual arts also extended to cinema - he made films with Jean Renoir, Jacques Becker and Andr&eacute; Zvoboda and a documentary on Republican Spain (1937). In 1947 Cartier-Bresson co-founded the photographic cooperative Magnum along with fellow photographers Robert Capa, George Rodger, David Seymour and Bill Vandivert.<br /><br />Cartier-Bresson retired from photography in 1973 to return to painting, and his first love, drawing. He once said in an interview, \\"Photography is a sketchbook. Drawing is meditation.\\"<br /><br />Henri Cartier-Bresson died on August 3, 2004 in Paris. He left behind a photographic record of the world, mid-20th century. He will probably be best remembered, however, as an artist who had tremendous insight into ordinary people and the extraordinary ability to capture fleeting emotion on their faces. Some of his best photographs, I think, include: girls in Bali preparing to dance; a prisoner thrusting a fist and leg out of his cell door; children peeping over the Berlin Wall - in fact, all his spontaneous pictures of children; old priests awaiting midnight Mass in Italy; the funeral of an old Kabuki actor, a captivating portrait of Henri Matisse; lovers kissing at a Paris cafe; and exquisite landscapes and cityscapes, worldwide.<br /><br />\\"Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Man, the Image and the World: A Retrospective\\" was published in honor of the artist's 95th birthday. An enormous selection of photographs is offered here, more than 600 reproductions, film stills, paintings and drawings on fine heavy art paper, taken over a period of fifty years. These images represent the best of his life's work. Fascinating essays by art and photography critics are included in the volume.<br /><br />Henri Cartier-Bresson once wrote. \\"A velvet hand, a hawk's eye - these we should all have.\\" This man was blessed with both the hand and the eye.

The Zohar, one of the great masterpieces of Western religious thought, represents an attempt to uncover hidden meanings behind the world of appearances. It is the central work in the literature of the Kabbalah, the Jewish mystical tradition. It has been said that the Kabbalah, dating back to the second century B.C. E., actually encompasses \\"the spiritual heritage of all mankind,\\" and offers tools for \\"transforming chaos and fragmentation into unity and completion.\\" The Zohar is the \\"Book of Splendor.\\" And \\"The Book of Splendor\\" is the transforming element in Frances Sherwood's unusual and beautiful historical novel of magical realism - Eastern European style. .<br /><br />It is to the Zohar that the great Judah Loew, Rabbi of Prague, turns when he discovers that, once again, the Christians are targeting his people for a lethal pogrom, which could mean total eradication. The year is 1601. The Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph Habsburg II rules from his throne in Prague. He is quite mad and totally obsessed with becoming immortal. Rudolph is terrified of death - in fact, he is so petrified that, thinking to get the upper hand of Death, he tried to kill himself. At a time when the Jews were being expelled and tormented all over Europe, Rudolph's father had given them sanctuary in Prague, where their living conditions are far from perfect, but they are, at least, allowed to live. The city's Jews are anxious that their capricious ruler might discontinue his father's policies and withhold protection in times of trouble and violence. There is good cause for anxiety. The obsessed Rudolph is too focused on the possibilities of life immortal to care for the Jewish community's problems. In desperation the Rabbi, a tzaddik - a righteous man, decides to create a golem to protect his people. \\"A golem is, at best, a God-send, at worst blasphemy incarnate.\\"<br /><br />Taking mud from the right bank of the Vltava, Judah Loew fashions a large man, a veritable giant. He is formed exactly as a male human being, in fact he looks a bit like the rabbi in his youth, but has no tongue with which to speak. He has no history, no ancestors, \\"no choice to his direction.\\" He has no soul. He has been made to serve, to defend and to preserve lives. In preparation to craft the golem, the rabbi had fasted for seven days, and studied, yet again, the worn pages of \\"The Book of Splendor,\\" to discover the profound meaning hidden within. He sang Psalm 139.....\\"until the words became a meditation ingrained in heart and mind.\\" And he brought to life the golem, whom he named Yossel. But unbeknownst to the rabbi, the artificial man could feel and think. Just as his creation was an act of faith, a miracle, so was it that Yossel had the knowledge, perception and reason of an educated man.<br /><br />There lived in the Judenstadt, (ghetto), at this time, a beautiful young seamstress, Rochel. Illegitimate, she was thought to be a child of rape, her mother having barely escaped from a pogrom with her life. She is an outsider in a community of outsiders. In an act of charity, Zev, a widower and the local shoemaker, takes her to wife. She is grateful and strives to be a good spouse according to Torah, to put frivolous thoughts from her mind. But Zev is old and not handsome. And Rochel is vibrant and young.<br /><br />Ms. Sherwood has woven two parallel stories here, along with various delightful subplots. One is the bittersweet tale of Rochel, Zev, and of Prague's Jewish community, led by the legendary Rabbi Loew. The other is of Rudolph II, who is going madder by the day in his glorious castle on a hill. He has brought two alchemists from England to discover and concoct the formula which will grant him eternal life. They know they are doomed to failure and certain death, but their pottering in the laboratory, while various members of the Emperor's staff, and the community at large, kibbitz and comment, makes for some hilarious reading.<br /><br />The author has interwoven elementsof sharply etched realism, representing ordinary events and descriptive details, together with fantastic and dreamlike elements, as well as material derived from myth and fairy tales. Her characters, from the actual historic figures of Emperor Rudolph, Rabbi Loew, the English alchemists Dee and Kelley, astronomers Johannes Kepler and Tycho Brahe, to the creations of her imagination, all brim with life. They are radiant and compelling. The prose is exquisite. This one goes on my bookshelf for keeps!

Eva's Cousin\\" is a work of fiction. Sibylle Knauss had always been interested in matters of German history and how they could be transformed into literature. Before beginning her novel, the author, had the opportunity to interview  Gertrude Weisker, Eva Braun's real cousin and the model for her central character, Marlene. Eva Braun had indeed invited Ms. Weisker, 20 years-old at the time, to stay with her at Berchtesgaden in the spring of 1944, a year before WWII would end with Germany's unconditional surrender to Allied Forces, her cities, country and people laid waste. Hitler was away in east Prussia, waging war, and Eva was lonely - she needed to be amused. Although based on fact, many of the folks who people these pages are fictional, as are their stories. Essentially, however, Ms. Knauss captures the true characters of Eva, her cousin, and those who surrounded them, as well as the very ambiance of the Berghof itself, and the period, which represent, as Hannah Arendt worded it, \\"the banality of evil.\\"<br /><br />This is beautifully written, nuanced fiction, not an action-packed thriller, but I was riveted to the page even so. More dramatic and disturbing than the image of Nero fiddling while Rome burned, is one of the New Year Eve Ball, (1944-45), at the Platerhof Hotel in Obersalzberg, near Adolph Hitler's Bavarian mountain retreat. It was not a party for ascetics. Featured on the menu were: goose liver pate, larded saddle of venison, eels in aspic, Parma ham and overflowing bottles of champagne - all one could drink, and more. However, the hungry were not to be fed at this feast. The hungry and starving were in Auschwitz and Dachau. They were slave laborers in German factories. They were women and children throughout Europe. They were soldiers at the front. On this same New Year's Eve, the nearby Bavarian capital of Munich was in ruins. The revelers partied as if there were no tomorrow, and for many of them the tomorrows would be few. They welcomed in the new year, \\"the year of their downfall, rejoicing.\\" Throughout the novel the luxurious lives of the politically and \\"genetically privileged\\" are juxtaposed with the unspoken - with those of the people of Europe, the rest of the world, in fact, the German citizens who were being bombed to smithereens 24/7. Were these human beings? Very much so, our author tells us.<br /><br />This is the story of two young women who were fortunate enough to spend almost a year together at one of the world's most beautiful places, the Bavarian Alps. Yes, they were seemingly fortunate until one realizes that their host was Adolph Hitler. Evil rubs off, if in no other way than by selective blindness to the horrors which the man and his machine perpetrated on a daily basis. These women listened to the BBC. They were not ignorant. They lived right above a slave labor camp. They saw. Evil is being a sycophant to evil doers. Evil is luxuriating in the spoils of a heinous war. Evil is accepting the dehumanization of human beings, and ignoring the merciless slaughter of same.<br /><br />Marlene, just twenty, was naive and worshipped her older, more glamorous cousin Eva, Hitler's long time mistress. Eva, a superficial woman, not overly bright, was addicted to shopping, pretty clothes and jewelry. She was, herself, an ornament. One of the few instructions she left before she committed suicide was that her papers, the ones with shopping lists, unpaid bills, and receipts, be burned. She did not want to go down in history as a shopaholic - \\"the only sin she was aware of committing.\\" Ms. Braun was virtually unknown to Germans outside Hitler's inner circle, and had little personal worth other than that of being linked to the Fuhrer. Mistresses did not command much respect in this male dominated, macho society. Still the two played, girl-like, giggling, at sports, skinny dipping in a gorgeous mountain lake, riding, and hiking. Outside the world had become Hell incarnate - \\"inside frocks were being made amongst the ruins.\\" There is even a love story here, of sorts. A powerful SS officer, much older than Marlene, fell in love with her. For a moment, one could almost forget the \\"SS\\" part, when he whispered tender words of love to her. However, when she asked her romantic knight about the terrible conditions of the starving laborers, he tells her abruptly that the slaves are not human beings like the German people. They do not feel and suffer as Germans do, and they are lazy and must be dealt with harshly. Forget? How can one forget?<br /><br />Ms. Knauss said in an interview about the four women, both her fictional protagonists and the real-life Eva and Gertrude, \\"They are examples of people who were very close to the center of Nazism, but somehow they were also very far from it. They didn't think about anything political, about political crimes or war, they just lived their little everyday lives at the Berghof.\\" She also makes the point that when she wrote the novel, Gertrude Weisker's story was not the point. She wanted to write about what it felt like to be a young woman at that time, with such close proximity to the Fuhrer and his private world. What would be the consequences, on one's character, on one's very soul, of this proximity? This is a most powerful novel - in its content, writing style and the excellent translation. \\"Eva's Cousin\\" is an eye-opener!<br />JANAre is even a love story here, of sorts.

This unusual novel makes for a refreshing change of pace, and is a delightful page turner with some very tense moments. There are actually two fascinating protagonists here. One is German American freelance hitman, Paul Schumann - or as they say in 1930's crime lingo, a \\"button man.\\" The other is Kripo (Police) Inspector Willi Kohl, a regular Berliner Sherlock Holmes. The Kripo is pre-War Germany's professional police force which lost much of its power to Himmler's Gestapo in 1933, after Hitler rose to power. Inspector Kohl is a dedicated professional with an excellent understanding of irony. He is not a fan of National Socialism, and seems to pull pertinent clues out of thin air from time-to-time. Deaver packs this book chock-full of period detail which gives a rich texture to the narrative.<br /><br />Paul Shumann may murder for a living, but he does have a conscious. He only takes \\"righteous assignments,\\" killing those who are themselves evil and deserve to be wiped out. A former contract employee of \\"Lucky\\" Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegal and \\"Deanie\\" O'Banion, Shumann never says he kills for a living. He uses \\"touch-off\\"  as a job description. \\"It was a phrase that Sergeant Alvin York used to describe killing enemy soldiers during the War. It makes Paul feel less like a punk to use a term that a war hero did.\\" He is meticulous about his work and is known as a brilliant tactician, until he gets caught! The folks who finally nab him are US Navy Intelligence honchos and a US Senator. They want to make a deal. They will give Shumann a \\"get out of jail free\\" pass and pay him big enough bucks to make a fresh start at a decent life, if he will go to Nazi Germany and kill Reinhard Ernst - the dedicated architect of Hitler's clandestine rearmament. If he refuses, he can call Sing Sing home and, perhaps, expect the electric chair. The Olympic Games are being held in Berlin and Paul is scheduled to sail with the US team, disguised as a journalist. Ossining, NY, is not an option.<br /><br />Shumann arrives and finds Germany to be a land of hardship and deprivation, where brutal Brownshirts are in control of the streets, Jews and other innocents are persecuted, and unbelievable atrocities are committed. It's actually much worse than mob infested New York, where Paul calls home. He takes a room near Berlin's Central Park, called the Tiergarten, (\\"Garden of Beasts\\"). Needless to say, he immediately gets into trouble, or we wouldn't have a plot. The extremely clever Inspector Kohl is on his trail right away, always just a step behind, amazing even Paul with his sleuthing talents. Shumann's contacts are an American agent and a very colorful German gangster, who provide assistance when they can, and occasionally hinder rather than help. Paul stalks Ernst, while Kohl follows Paul, and the Gestapo, which has been tipped-off about the American who plans to ruin the Fuhrer's Olympic Games, is just a few steps behind them.<br /><br />The cast of characters is really fabulous. The author has done an extremely clever job of creating them and fleshing them out. Olympic star, Jesse Owens, whose triumphs so irritated Hitler that he shunned the medal ceremonies, plays a minor role here. Jesse likes Paul so much he even covers for him when the police inspector comes snooping. Sports journalist and writer Damon Runyan is a Shumann friend. And of course the usual Third Reich suspects are present.<br /><br />There were times when the pace slowed down considerably, and I was distracted by Deaver's insistence on translating all the German place names into English. Most people don't need translations for Unter den Linden, Tiergarten, Heil, and the Fuhrer (the Leader, we are informed). Overall, however, this is a terrific novel, which proves to be much more than the usual suspense thriller.<br /><br />This is Jeffrey Deaver's first historical novel and it has earned him the \\"Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award\\" from the Crime Writers Association of Great Britain.<br />JANAthriller.

Once again Irene Kelly, veteran reporter for the News Express, in the fictional Southern California town of Las Piernas, investigates some serious crime. One of Irene's flaws, unfortunately, is stubbornness which borders on the extreme. As intelligent as she is, she frequently acts on impulse and winds up doing what she has been specifically told not to do, often with life-threatening results. Frank Harriman, a homicide detective with La Piernas Police Department, is Irene's boyfriend and emotional support system.<br /><br />Jacob Henderson, teenaged son of a district attorney candidate, comes to Irene claiming his father's opponent intends to use smear tactics and claim he is involved in a Satanic cult. A photograph was taken of the boy at a coven gathering, but he was there to convince a young girl, his friend Gethsemane (Sammy), to leave with him. Irene talks to the troubled girl, who substantiates Jacob's story. She tells the reporter that the cult is Wiccan, not Satanist. There are disturbing signs of cult activity in town, most of which seem to have a connection to a local runway shelter, which is sponsored by Frank's neighbor and dear friend, 80 year-old Althea Fremont. That same evening, Halloween, Mrs. Fremont is murdered and Satanic ritual symbols are left on her door. Irene begins to suspect there is more to this coven than meets the eye. Then Sammy disappears and a human heart is left on Irene's doorstep. Danger to Irene escalates when there are no indications she will back-off the case. This is a darker, edgier novel then the previous one, with some grim, brutal torture scenes. To come out of this alive, Irene will have to face-down the devil.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Dreams, Irene\\" is non-stop drama, thrills and chills. However, the narrative is not as taut as I expected it to be, having read two of the author's other books. The primary focus here is on Irene's relationship with Frank - which I actually enjoy. They are both fascinating, well developed characters and the chemistry between them is electric. As usual, Ms. Burke surrounds Irene with a number of interesting and memorable friends and family members, characters who add to the depth and richness of the novel. Our heroine does less investigating than usual here, and, more or less, stumbles into trouble and onto clues rather than initiating the action. This is novel #2 in the series, and the author is just beginning to develop the background storyline and characters. Her writing becomes much tighter, and her plots more well defined, in future books.

Irene Kelly, the woman referred to in Jan Burke's \\"Goodnight Irene,\\" is a veteran reporter for the News Express, in the fictional Southern California town of Las Piernas. She is presently working for a public relations firm, however, after having quit her job at the newspaper. Kelly made the temporary career change as a result of an argument concerning professional ethics with the publication's very unprofessional editor-in-chief. Then Conn O'Conner, Irene's beloved best friend, and longtime mentor at the Express, is brutally murdered. The only clue Irene can come up with is O'Connor's obsession with a long-unsolved homicide and an unidentified female body discovered in Las Piernas 35 years before. The corpse's face had been destroyed, and her hands and feet cut off so that her identity could not be established. The police dubbed her Hannah and tried for years to solve the case, to no avail. Newspaperman O'Connor wrote the original stories back then and had never given up on finding the identity of this Jane Doe. Every year, on the anniversary of her murder, he wrote his famous \\"Hannah\\" column, usually targeting more recently disappeared people.<br /><br />Homicide cop Frank Harriman, Irene's love interest from years before, is working on the O'Conner case, and asks Irene to get her job back at the Express in order to take over her former mentor's assignments. The rationale is that she might be able to find information useful to the investigation while continuing the dead man's work. In O'Conner's confidential files, she discovers a maze of forensic records that suggest a motive far more sinister than anyone imagined for the newspaperman's violent death, the unidentified woman's murder, and more recently, three horrific and separate attacks on Irene's, Frank's and O'Conner's son's lives. The unknown killer will obviously resort to anything to prevent past secrets from coming to light. And Irene and Frank develop a closer relationship as they work together to find the murderer(s).<br /><br />I had never read an Irene Kelly mystery until last month when I picked-up \\"Bloodlines,\\" the most recent book in the series.

She is an honest woman, very genuine, but usually winds up on the wrong side of every door. Amanda is quite impulsive and flirts with men, and boys, almost compulsively. Excessive drinking and keeping her own anger in rein are issues.<br /><br />Bobby is a good man at heart. He is not mean, but he is controlling. He loves his wife and daughter, however, like most violent people, he grew up surrounded by violence. He was a victim also. The couple wants to keep their marriage together. They have committed to do so. Bobby has joined an anger management group and they have entered couples counseling with a trusted priest.<br /><br />The author's character driven narrative is simply told, in a linear manner. The protagonists are well developed, three-dimensional people with some serious flaws - but they are likeable people too. Donahue doesn't over dramatize the violence, which is certainly dramatic enough, by concentrating on blood and gore. Instead he focuses on the love the couple has for each other, and for their daughter, and the anguish they both feel. The writing is not tight, however, and this is a problem. In an effort to show the quotidian, Donahue bogs down the narrative with excessive, repetitious, mundane details - what is eaten for breakfast each morning, who brushes their teeth in which bathroom, the daily list of household chores, who orders what at the restaurant, etc.. I think the novel would greatly improve with editing. There were times that I was about to put the book aside for the above reasons, but I was caught-up in the compelling characters and their story. I would have rated the novel 3 Stars, but I was riveted enough to continue reading late into the night. Check out the book at a local store, or your library, so you can glance through it and read a few pages before you decide to buy. A fascinating topic and characters - and a surprise ending.<br /><br />Nearly one-third of American women (31 percent) report being physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives.

Although not action-packed, (slow at times), it is riveting in its own way, and gathers lots of speed before it reaches a stunning conclusion. Her complex characters, their development and quirkiness, are a treat to read about.<br /><br />Professor Jason (Lars) Larson is a charismatic scholar of Romantic and Victorian literature at an upscale Connecticut university. To say he is frivolous is to put it mildly. I, personally, would evaluate him as terminally narcissistic. He adores teaching and is as romantic as the subject he specializes in. Occasionally, he also finds himself adoring one of the inevitable female students who swoon over him. He believes he does no harm with his infidelities. He is sophisticated, he thinks, like the Europeans. \\"Flirtation, romance, discreet affairs; these were his metier, his gift.\\" There is no doubt that Lars cherishes his family - his wife, the beautiful and understanding Emma, and precocious Cookie, his daughter, now on the cusp of adolescence. Unfortunately, Emma aids and abets him in his extra-curricular activities by indulging him more than he deserves, and remaining silent. Although he is discreet, he does have quite a reputation around campus. Students line up in droves to take his creative, dynamic classes. Particularly sought after are the few spots he has allotted each semester for independent study.<br /><br />The whimsical, eccentric Iris Weed enters Larson's life and the impact she is to have on him and his family will last forever. Iris is an attractive young woman, though quite complex, with an extraordinary gift for writing and a particular penchant for Blake, Byron and Shelly. Her talent is truly unusual. Lars recognizes this almost immediately and offers to supervise her in independent study. Iris is living in a truck for the semester - sleeping in the back, without running water or other modern conveniences. Fortunately she has a swimming class in the morning, which she has specifically taken to use the showers. Iris thinks of herself as a modern day Thoreau and is keeping diaries to document her experience for her senior project. Lars finds himself falling for Iris, even obsessing about her, a new experience for him.<br /><br />When Iris is brutally murdered in a parking lot, near her truck, Professor Jason Larson is thrust into the middle of a criminal investigation. He becomes prime suspect numero uno when the police discover his intense interest in the victim. To make matters worse, Lars had been seen arguing with Iris near the murder scene just before the crime was committed. His heretofore successful life spirals out of control as he himself loses control. He makes frantic efforts to cover up any potentially damaging evidence that would link him to his former student. This time, however, he is not able to use his charm to make things better.<br /><br />Although Larson is not the most likeable of fictional characters, the author ultimately treats him with sympathy and manages to win over her readers - at least she won me over. Her use of satire is very effective when depicting the smug world of academia. Ms. Lawson dramatically weaves her narrative along with Iris' diary entries to provide a thrilling read.<br /><br />JANA- sleeping in the back, without running water or other modern conveniences.

It's hard not to like a character who loves animals, even mean animals - the mad ones, the dirty, the underfed, the sick, vermin infested animals too, some trained to kill. Dogs, cats, parakeets, etc., they're Lorenzo Brown's thing. He's an officer for the Humane Society Law Enforcement team in Washington, D.C., and likes his job, a lot. Lorenzo figures if something is off with an animal, it's a human's fault, and is ready to paper offenders and serve search and/or arrest warrants if necessary. He saved his own dog, Jasmine, the night before her scheduled euthanization. She is the first pet he has every owned.<br /><br /> Brown is an ex-con, out on parole after 8 years in prison for a drug charge. He is determined to stay straight. Each morning, when he walks Jasmine, he passes the home of Nigel Johnson's mother. Occasionally, he will see Nigel there, along with a couple of young men wearing thick platinum chains. The troops lean against their rides - BMW coupes and sedans, a black Escalade, \\"tricked with spinners in the mix.\\" The black GS430 with \\"dual pipes and aftermarket rims\\" belongs to Nigel, now a powerful drug kingpin, who is usually busy directing business, talking on his Nextel. Lorenzo and Nigel, both smart and ambitious as kids, had run the streets together, going back almost twenty-five years. Brown had done the righteous thing by his friend. He stayed silent when he was pressured to give Nigel up. Brown chose to serve his time instead. Now he has had enough of the life. His old friends don't quite get it, however.<br /><br />Rachel Lopez also loves her work. She is Lorenzo's parole officer and one of the finest. She comes on tough initially and lays down the rules, but she wants all her people to make it. She has invested much of herself in their ultimate success. Rachel knows Lorenzo has committed crimes not included in his jacket. To have advanced in the game as far as he had, he probably did some violence, maybe even killed. She also knows that now, in the present, Lorenzo is not a bad man. But Ms. Lopez has problems of her own. Her own life is spinning out of control, and her late nights are taking their toll.<br /><br />Officer Brown needs Officer Lopez' support right now. He needs all the help he can get. A stupid mistake concerning turf boundaries has triggered enmity between local gangs. A psychopathic youth is on the streets, looking for a way to escalate the problem; waiting for the slightest opportunity to kill. A war is about to go down and our man could very well be sucked into it.<br /><br />I have long been a George Pelecanos fan. Over the years, I have read all his books, and to tell the truth, he has only written novels that I love, and others that I like a lot. This one is special though. I was deeply moved by the character of Lorenzo Brown, a really decent man trying to straighten out his life. The author lets us in on his thought processes. Mr. Brown is far from perfect. He carries within himself a strong streak of humanity though, which is his saving grace. Then there is Rachel Lopez, whom I also grew to care about. She is battling, against the odds, to keep her head above water. They both are having a real hard time in this world, yet always look to give someone else a hand up.<br /><br />No one captures the mean streets of the neighborhood like Pelecanos. His gritty prose, street-smart dialogue, fast-paced narrative and wonderful character development are what make his books bestsellers - literate ones! Highly recommended!<br />JANAsent, Lorenzo is not a bad man. But Ms. Lopez has problems of her own. Her own life is spinning out of control, and her late nights are taking their toll.

Some day, all this will have to be developed, carefully printed, fixed.\\"  In the seven portraits of Weimar Berlin that comprise \\"The Last Of Mr. Norris\\" and \\"Goodbye To Berlin,\\" Isherwood chronicles his life among the demimonde in this gloriously decadent capital city. He lived there, off and on, between 1929 and 1933. These marvelous stories are a fusion of fact and fiction. With each tale, and the passing of time, the sense of foreboding and prophetic imagery intensifies, as Germany prepares to embrace Adolph Hitler.<br /><br />Berlin was still a charming city of broad avenues, parks and caf&eacute;s during this period. It was also a grotesque metropolis of night-people, visionaries, political fanatics - a place filled with intrigue, where vice and virtue were found in abundance - more of the former than the latter. 1930s Berlin was a powerful city of mobs and millionaires. And it was one huge salon, a center of European intellectual life where the arts and sciences flourished. This is the scene which provides a backdrop for Isherwood's stories.<br /><br />\\"The Last of Mr. Norris\\" is an ironic adventure story, of sorts, narrated by William Bradshaw, a Christopher Isherwood-type figure who tutors English in Berlin. An elderly British double-agent, who is a bit of a fool with a cloudy reputation, becomes involved in the bloody struggle between the Nazis and the Communists.<br /><br />The six \\"Goodbye To Berlin\\" stories form a  relatively continuous narrative. In \\"A Berlin Diary - Autumn 1930,\\" Isherwood introduces the reader to his landlady, the infamous Fraulein Schroeder, \\"Schroederschen,\\" who calls him Herr Issyvoo. She is able to recite a history of her former lodgers by looking at the spots, stains and spillages left behind on her furniture, carpets and linens. Fellow flatmates include: Frl. Kost, a young woman, plump, blonde and pretty, who makes a living at the world's oldest profession - extremely upscale, of course; Bobby, who is a mixer at a west-end bar called the Troika, has adopted an English Christian name because they are all the rage; a commercial traveler, who is out most of the time, lives in the tiny attic which Frl. Schroeder refers to as the Swedish Pavilion; and Frl. Mayr, with her enormous arms, bull-dog jaw and coarse string-colored hair, is a music hall singer - the best in all of Germany, Schroeder assures with pride.<br /><br />\\"Sally Bowles\\" certainly is divine decadence, and her antics make for a wonderful story. I had a difficult time keeping the image of Liza Minnelli singing \\"Cabaret\\" out of my mind, however. I must say though, after reading about Isherwood's Sally, I have to laud Ms. Minnelli on her performance. Her characterization is indeed recognizable in this Ms. Bowles.<br /><br />\\"On Ruegen Island - Summer 1931\\" describes the author's holiday and the two characters he becomes involved with at a summer resort, Otto Nowak and Peter Wilkinson. Otto is a working class German youth, who uses his attractiveness to freeload off of men and women alike, rather than earn an honest wage. Peter Wilkinson, an Englishman living in Berlin, is extremely neurotic and very attached to Otto, although the two quarrel and bicker constantly.<br /><br />\\"The Nowaks,\\" Otto, (of Ruegen Island), and his immediate family, take Isherwood in as a lodger. As money became more difficult to come by and the effects of hyperinflation take their toll on Christopher's pocketbook, he has to economize and temporarily leaves Frl. Schroeder's relatively luxurious flat, for the slum-like, working-class projects of Wassertorstrasse.<br /><br />In \\"The Landaurers,\\" a wealthy Jewish family is aware of what is in store with the rise of Hitler's Nazism. Natalie befriends Isherwood, and throughher so does her family. In this story the perils ahead are obvious and the Landaurers make preparations to leave Germany.<br /><br />And in \\"A Berlin Diary - Winter - 1932-33\\" Isherwood bids farewell to Berlin. He will not return until 1952.<br /><br />These are well written and important stories which paint a picture of a never-to-be-forgotten time. The language and content give a real sense of the period, and Christopher Isherwood's taut and descriptive narrative is superb. Highly recommended!<br /><br />JANAd, and through her so does her family.

Sternfeld expanded this study with \\"A Stranger Passing.\\" The sixty color portraits of ordinary Americans included in this book, and made over a fifteen year period, were first shown at The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2001, and published at the same time.<br /><br />Although Douglas R. Nickel describes this book as a collection of portraits in his introductory essay, Joel Sternfeld's vivid images are so much more than traditional photographic portraiture. The pictures go beyond reflecting a mere image of the subject, no matter how interesting or aesthetic. And Sternfeld's subjects are more than the people being photographed. He has captured here the very essence of our culture - Americans, depicted in the context of their daily lives, during odd moments between events. Many of the warmest images feature relationships between two people.<br /><br />Each photograph tell a story. The volume's cover portrait is titled \\"Young Man Gathering Shopping Carts.\\" A teenager, with blond bobbed hair, open shirt, loosened tie, stands in a parking lot cluttered with pink shopping carts. The ubiquitous strip mall is the backdrop. His stance, the look of discontent on his face, and the generic locale say much more than most narratives. Sternfeld stirs the viewers imagination. One cannot help but wonder about the subjects' lives - the before and after of each picture. \\"A Lawyer with Laundry,\\" New York, portrays a seemingly reluctant subject, laundry in hand, leaning against a newsstand while warily suffering the photographer's attention. Some of my other favorites include: a colorful sari wrapped middle-eastern woman pumping gas in Kansas City; a young woman with bouffant hair, wearing a cotton-candy pink jacket holding her pet rabbit in a plastic carrying case; a forlorn woman on a New York City street holding a spectacular Christmas wreath; a man grilling a single hamburger on a broken patio in Cincinnati; and<br />\\"Motorcyclists,\\" which shows a man on a motorcycle, wearing goggles and a leather jacket, with an adorable baby in the sidecar wearing a helmet.<br /><br />Douglas R. Nickel, who wrote the Introduction, is director of the Center for Creative Photography and associate professor of art history in the College of Fine Arts at the University of Arizona, Tucson. Ian Frazier, who contributed another fine essay is an author.<br /><br />I don't usually buy coffee table books, although some of them are gorgeous. I have found that while I may admire the work a few times, I wind up placing the volume in a prominant place and then only glance at it occasionally, while dusting. This book is special though. \\"Stranger Passing\\" is a \\"travelogue of sorts, a detached, understated but compelling portrait of the people with whom Sternfeld has come into contact during his itinerant journeys.\\" The photographer compels us to question the assumptions we make about others.

The Winters family of Holt, Long Island, NY, seemed to have it all. They lived in a big, beautiful house with high ceilings in an affluent neighborhood. The three Winters daughters were bright, adorable, energetic. They attended excellent schools. A tight threesome, Madeline at 13 years-old was the organized one, the \\"good girl.\\" Caroline, just a few years older, watched out for her younger sisters, she was the responsible one. She gave Madeline her first cigarette when the youngster was 13...but told her not to inhale. Ellie was five, with a grin that lit up her whole face....and whatever room she happened to be in. Their love for each other shone on their faces. Behind their home was a small expanse of wooded land. The girls turned this area into a make-believe city, where Madeline was called Moo, Caroline was Candy, and Ellie became Laurel. Each had a chic apartment in this fantasy land, Candy had a career as a famous musician, Laurel was a busy actress, and Moo taught school and had a boyfriend named Renaldo.<br /><br />Mr. Winter was a Wall Street stockbroker and quite successful, when he was not at home, en famille. In the grand house with the tall ceilings, around his beautiful wife and three lovely daughters, Mr. Winter was a drunk - a mean, sadistic drunk, who occasionally caused his children to hide together in their walk-in closets, and even to sleep there, fearful, all huddled in a pile of comforters. Oh, he knew where they were, but the closed-in closet gave the kids a feeling of safety and the sounds of his harsh voice, his rage, and their mother's crying, were diminished with the door closed. Mrs. Winter, Isabelle, a still beautiful southern belle and ex-beauty queen, left the good life behind when she moved to New York looking for a different experience. She eloped and got what she wanted, sadly. Spending much of her time in her own world, she was lost in the past. Withdrawn, vague, she was inaccessible to her daughters. Caroline, who is the novel's narrator, once said, \\"We did not feel sorry for them, my parents, wandering miserably through their grand house like ghosts. All we knew was that they were not like other parents, and we hated them for it. When you are small, if you reach out and nobody takes your hand, you stop reaching out and reach inside instead.\\"<br /><br />One evening, after a particularly nasty episode, the three sisters decided to run away. Caroline had just received her driver's licence which made leaving town less complicated - so the girls thought. She prepped her mother's Oldsmobile for the trip. This was the get-away car they planned to take. Necessities were packed, including gummie bears for Ellie, and the route to New Orleans, (their destination), was marked on the map. The three made clear arrangements to hook-up after school, and then take-off. Caroline and Madeline waited hours for Ellie at their designated meeting place. She never appeared. They saw her enter school that morning. They never saw her again. That was fifteen years ago.<br /><br />Ellie's disappearance had a tremendous impact on the family which still resonates today. Her two older sisters' are left with holes in their lives as well as their hearts. Talented Caroline, with so much potential to be a concert pianist, had been accepted to study at the Juilliard School. She uses that talent to serve cocktails in a New Orleans rotating bar, The Highball - just hanging out. At 32, she is lost. Her evenings are spent reading trashy novels. She waitresses during the days and \\"fantasizes about strange men.\\" Her once close relationship with Madeline is now tenuous, at best. Madeline married a stockbroker, a nice guy, and they live in Manhattan. She had argued with Ellie on the day the child disappeared, and has been steeped in guilt ever since. Mr. Winters died years before of cirrhosis. Isabelle Winters has greatly improved with his demise, although she still packs the Chardonnay away. She constantly leafs through publications, searching for photographs which might be of her missing daughter. One day she sees a photo in People Magazine of a Montana woman at a rodeo. The woman's face is Ellie's, or what Ellie would have looked like at 21 - she is sure of it. Caroline is skeptical but admits there is a resemblance. Madeline, now pregnant, wants her long lost sister declared dead, so she can finally have closure. Both young women have always blamed themselves for Ellie's disappearance.<br /><br />Caroline makes a spur of the moment decision to drive to Montana to see if the lead on Ellie pans out. Armed with maps, copies of the photograph, a book called \\"Be Your Own Private Dick,\\" and a case of Dixie beer, Caroline heads to Missoula, to begin the search.<br /><br />Amanda Eyre Ward's beautifully written narrative unfolds as part suspense novel, part memoir, as Caroline is accompanied on her trip north by memories of a troubled childhood and reflections on her present circumstances. Hers is an intelligent voice, filled with wry observations. She is sharp, perceptive and seems to hide a world of hurt behind her cynicism. The author's pacing is on target. The prose is spare, which accentuates the emotional intensity. This is a page turner, with twists that will keep the reader guessing. And the plot holds surprises right up until the final sentence.

Levi	Until Myriam Anissimov published this comprehensive biography of Primo Levi in 1998, the world knew him primarily through his own writings. He was born into an assimilated middle-class Jewish family in Turin, Italy, in 1919. His people were not observant Jews, and Levi, apparently, knew little about \\"Jewishness\\" until Mussolini's anti-Semitic policy taught him something about his heritage. His father, Casare, was an electrical engineer and an avid reader. Primo learned from him that the humanities and the sciences need not be separate worlds.<br /><br />Trained as a chemist, he was arrested during the Second World War as a member of the anti-Fascist resistance and deported to the Monowitz concentration camp, part of the Auschwitz complex in 1944. Badly beaten and half-starved, Levi was determined to spend his time mentally recording his irrational world \\"with the curiosity of the naturalist.\\" His background in chemistry actually saved his life, Levi was to acknowledge later. After being transferred to work in the camp laboratory his situation improved dramatically. Anissimov's account of the final days at Auschwitz - when Levi, suffering from scarlet fever, managed to forage, with a few comrades, through a semi-dismantled concentration camp in the freezing cold - is the focal point of her book. Her research is meticulous. Levi survived 11 months as slave laborer 174517 until the liberation of what he called \\"that hideous distortion of humanity.\\" Seven months after the war, he was still a refugee in Russia, trying to make his way home.<br /><br />When he returned to Turin, to the same apartment where he had always lived, he felt a terrible need to bear witness. He had watched as fellow inmates were stripped of their essential selves before they died in the flesh. His powerful memoirs, works of fiction and poetry describe his experience in the death camp and his later travels in Eastern Europe. Levi wrote. \\"And I felt like Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, who waylays on the street the wedding guests going to the feast, inflicting on them the story of his misfortune.\\" The civilized world did not seem to care what he had to say, however. No large publisher would accept his powerful manuscript, \\"Survival in Auschwitz.\\" Anissimov reports that the book received a few positive reviews but was \\"distributed rather than sold.\\"<br /><br />For the last forty years of his life Levi devoted himself to understanding why he was not killed in the concentration camp. \\"The worst survived, that is, the fittest; the best all died,\\" he said. He spent much of his time writing about literature, astronomy, philosophy, the wonders of the natural life and the dignity of manual labor. Married with two children, he was a lifelong agnostic, and was described by some coreligionists as a stranger to Jewish culture. He worked at his profession, as a research chemist and factory manager, until his retirement. Plagued by survivor's guilt, and inner wounds, as well as the coverage the media was giving to Holocaust deniers, Levi, the most gentle of men, died in Turin in April 1987, an apparent suicide.<br /><br />This biography delves deeply into the life and mind of the man who was a philosophical student of life. Ms. Anissimov, a French journalist and novelist, explores the complex nature of the man, who was at once such a vital force, a real survivor in many senses, and the man prone to dark moods, disillusionment and bouts of severe depression. She writes, with riveting detail, about Levi's year in Auschwitz, drawing on his autobiographical accounts and those of other survivors. Hers was the supremely difficult task of attempting to do what Levi himself said he could not. He was not able to show how the survivor and the scientist, separately and together, perceived the world. \\"Primo Levi: Tragedy of an Optimist\\" is based primarily on Ms. Anissimov's reading of Levi's work, her correspondence or interviews with men and women associated with him, and interviews andessays on him by others. This painstaking journalistic endeavor is concise and clear, which is what Mr. Levi believed his own work should be - \\"avoiding embellishments and convolutions.\\" She has accomplished all this and more. I have read that many are disappointed that this biography did not delve more into Levi's personality, his psyche. I understand that his wife would not be interviewed. Nor would she release intimate personal papers. When close family members do not cooperate, and first-hand information is not available, it is almost impossible to form an accurate analysis of someone's inner complexities.<br /><br />I was deeply moved by this biography. There are flaws here, but overall it presents an extraordinary portrait of a great man. His writings were fundamental in shaping many people's understanding of what the Holocaust meant when he originally wrote about it, and what it means today, in the context of the 21st century. Some people, devastated by the manner in which he died, say that the Holocaust finally killed him. I do not believe this. Primo Levi fought almost all his life to live. He struggled to enjoy life and the world around him, and to bear witness, an enormous responsibility for anyone. He fought courageously for forty plus years. I respect him greatly for that, and for allowing us all to know him a little bit.<br />JANAThis painstaking journalistic endeavor is concise and clear, which is what Mr. Levi believed his own work should be - \\"avoiding embellishments and convolutions.\\" She has accomplished all this and more.

Dr. Joe Magee, a world-renowned professor of anthropology, specializing in pre-Colombian civilizations, is employed by the San Francisco Museum of American Antiquities. He conducts research and seminars from his home in the hills overlooking the lush Central Valley of California. Magee has a nice parcel of land and enjoys living in relative isolation. Except for his professional obligations, he has become reclusive in the last years, unusual for a man in his early thirties.<br /><br />Dr. Amy Parrish, anthropologist and world expert on Mayan culture, attends one of Magee's seminars. Previously, Joe had been asked by one of the museum's directors to hire her to collaborate with him on an upcoming expedition on his property. However, he had never even met Parrish and was reluctant to do so. After talking with her at length after the lectures, Magee decides to employ her for the enterprise, planned for the spring. The success of the job interview may be largely attributed to Amy's beautiful blonde looks, as well as her extreme intelligence, a terrific personality and a specialty in Mayan culture.<br /><br />The decline of the Maya civilization, and their disappearance from their home in the jungles of Central America, has long been a mystery. Dr. Magee, and other expedition members, plan to search for possible evidence that surviving members of this ancient civilization may have made their way north, as far as California's Central Valley. This hypothesis has long fascinated Amy Parrish. In fact, the work of both anthropologists meshes perfectly and Magee employs her ahead of time to assist on special projects and presentations. Amy moves out to Magee's property and into the lodging he provides for her near his home. The two turn from anthropology to detecting, however, when recent corpses are discovered on his property with their hearts torn out in a manner suggesting ancient Maya and/or Aztec sacrifices? They also find Mayan hieroglyphics in the area, forecasting the beginning of the Mayan Sixth World. It appears that 21st century descendents of the Maya are preparing for the cataclysmic end of the Fifth World, (that's the one we live in), as well as the inauguration of the Sixth, when the Maya will rule the earth.<br /><br />December 22, 2012 is the projected date for the event, based on actual Mayan predictions of the new age involving the Earth's ongoing reverse magnetic energy, sunspots and solar flares. Are the predictions accurate? And is Dr. Parrish more involved than she is aware of, with this civilization she has always felt an affinity for?<br /><br />The book's premise is certainly interesting. However, I had hoped that much more factual information about Mayan history, science and culture would be included in \\"The Sixth World.\\" I am disappointed that elements of the novel were not more evidentiary based, as would befit a book of this kind, which asks the reader to buy into the fantastic. Ultimately, I had a difficult time going along with the author's storyline because she failed to back up her case with historical research.<br /><br />The first part of the novel seems to focus primarily on the budding relationship between Parrish and Magee. Unfortunately, theirs is by no means a thrilling romance. There is little chemistry between the two, and they have barely kissed by page 200. What's worse, however, is I didn't even care, at this point, whether the prospective couple ever connected! I guess this means \\"The Sixth World\\" is not a romantic novel. Nor is it a historic novel, nor a fantasy sci-fi bolstered by fact. Other characters are introduced spottily, not in depth, as are the ancient Maya. At almost 400 pages, the book is overlong and the pace is slow during the first half. Almost no excitement - very little tension - is built in the relationships or in the mystery itself. The events warrant more passion than they actually provoke. The narrative could have been easily cut to make it more taut. I hung in there because I was hooked and wanted to see where the plot was leading. I am extremely interested in the Maya civilization, but was left wanting at the conclusion of \\"The Sixth World.\\" I felt as if I had been served an appetizer and now wanted the main course.<br /><br />As I said previously, I was curious enough to read the novel through to the end, so obviously there is interesting material here. Check it out at the library or book store, however, before you invest in a copy.<br />JANAwhere the plot was leading.

Absolutely indispensable, it includes 41 detailed maps for all five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island, along with several black and white photographs. As a New Yorker, I cannot think of anything that has not been included here. I frequently use the book myself, especially when I have out-of-town visitors. It is also excellent, for New Yorkers and visitors alike, to use on walking tours.

Molochai, Twig and Zillah, three androgynous Goth vagabonds all resembling rock stars, roll into New Orleans ready for Mardi Gras. Drunk on Chartreuse, their mouths full of candy, they make their way to a tiny bar with stained glass windows in the French Quarter. CHRISTIANS says the sign above the door. Christian, the bartender and owner, is a four hundred year-old vampire. Molochai, Twig and Zillah, younger by a few centuries, are also vampires. A thin adolescent girl, pretty Jessy, had long been waiting for the three, or their like. Her dream is to become one of them. She doesn't get her wish though. Unlike the myths, vampires are not made by a bite from the undead. They are born, just like humans. Impregnations are few and far between, and the women who carry them in their wombs, (frequently human women), usually die in childbirth. Bad lead vamp Zillah, with the gorgeous green eyes, takes a special liking to Jessy. After the evening is over, he leaves her alive and carrying his child.<br /><br />Fast forward fifteen years, Zillah and Jessy's son, \\"Nothing,\\" is living with his adoptive parents in a Maryland suburb, wondering why he feels so different from everyone else. Alienated and terribly lonely, he runs away from home and is picked-up hitching by the ever wandering Zillah, Twig and Molochai. Now he's found! \\"Lost Souls\\" chronicles his decline into his father's world and the inevitable loss of his soul. The three vamp sidekicks spend their lives going from place to place - seeing everything - cities and countryside, drinking blood from various sources, leaving scenes of carnage behind, and then turning around and beginning again - taking different routes which lead them back to the same cities. Drunk and/or drugged, these dark hedonists always come out unscathed, unlike their victims. Now they head for Missing Mile, NC, the home of Nothing's favorite musicians, the Lost Souls.<br /><br />Steve and Ghost are the vocalist and guitarist who make-up the Lost Souls. Nothing loves them, although he has never met them - he has only listened to their sound on tape. Ghost, the grandson of a backwoods' wise woman was born with a caul over his face. Ethereal in body and spirit, he is gifted with the sight, and is a truly decent human being - a man with soul. Steve, on the other hand has a ways to go before he becomes a mensch. As to the state of his soul - it's still up in the air. The musicians meet-up with the preternatural cohorts in a club in Missing Mile, where Nothing at last gets to meet his idols.<br /><br />Ghost and Steve want to save Nothing from himself and, ultimately, his fate. Steve's former girlfriend, Ann, winds up on the road with the monsters, pursued by our rock star heroes. The battle for the lost souls reaches its dramatic finale when Ms. Brite brings everyone together in The Big Easy.<br /><br />I was surprised at the quality of Poppy Brite's writing. It's good! Don't ask me why I expected otherwise. Her narrative is taut and her descriptive passages are at times lyrical, and always original. Her weakness lies in her characters' development. They are one dimensional. Ghost is wonderful, all goodness and light - but too angelic to be real. He is the shining heart of the novel. Steve, who is almost always on drugs and booze, is never really developed, although we get a sense that he is salvageable. And the vampires are dark cartoon-type characters - but maybe that's how vampires are supposed to be. They, and the vampire wannabe groupies, are all pale as corpses and dress in black, with black lipstick and mascara - a la Goth.<br /><br />Poppy Brite paints a picture of today's society through Goth eyes - surreal to say the least. If you're a fan of horror fiction, (the kind with gore and violence), or are into the funky and unusual, \\"Lost Souls\\" merits your attention.

Books	3	12	21	N	Y	An Action-Packed Novel About Israel's Struggle For Statehood	\\"The Gates of Zion\\"  begins with a brief prologue set in Qumran, 68 C.E.. Jerusalem has just fallen to the Romans. A Jewish scribe quickly and carefully copies the last passages of the book of the Prophet Isaiah. Then he wraps the scroll in linen, coats the linen with pitch, and prepares to bury it in a clay jar - along with all the other scrolls. He makes sure, at this hour of his death, that the words of God will be preserved for future generations. The Dead Sea Scrolls are about to be hidden.<br /><br />Two millennia later, on November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly, in its 128th plenary session, by a two-thirds vote (33 to 13 with Britain and nine others abstaining), passed Resolution 181 partitioning Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The Arab national movement in Palestine, as well as all the Arab countries, angrily rejected partition. Almost immediately there was Arab violence against the Jews in Palestine.<br /><br />Ellie Warne is an American photojournalist for LIFE Magazine, who unknowingly becomes the focus of danger when she takes pictures of ancient scrolls recently discovered by Bedouins. Ellie is staying with her uncle Howard, an archeologist, in Jerusalem. She finds new purpose when she decides to help the Hagganah prepare to defend the city of Jerusalem after the Partition.<br /><br />Rachel Lubetkin is a beautiful Jewish Holocaust survivor. She left the concentration camps behind in Europe, along with a big part of her soul. On her arm she bears the tattooed legacy, \\"Nur Fur Offizere, \\"For Officers Only.\\" The Nazis had used her as a prostitute. She is shunned by many of the refugees and called a traitor for not choosing death over forced prostitution.<br /><br />Moshe Sacher is a brilliant archeological linguist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He is also an active Hagganah leader who smuggles European Jews, refugees from the camps, into Palestine. Moshe, a tall, slender, good looking young man, is in love with Ellie Warne.<br /><br />David Meyer, a US Air Force war vet, is also in love with Ellie. He has come to Palestine for her, and also to help form the new State of Israel's air force. David, a reckless, carefree man, never realized the extent of his affection for Ellie until she left California. Now he wants her back, but she has another man on her mind, as well as her career and the commitment she made to build the newly formed state.<br /><br />Nine year-old Yacov Lebowitz lives in the Old Jewish City of Jerusalem with his elderly grandfather, a Rabbi. Yacov was in Palestine with his grandfather when his parents and siblings were taken away by the Germans.<br /><br />These characters and many more - Jew, Arab and British - hero and villain - come together to make this an action-packed historical novel. Ms. Brodie's narrative is obviously biased. Her tale is based on the Jewish/Zionist point of view. While she exposes the cruelty, deception and politics of Arab terrorism, she never mentions the Palestinian Muslim's position. The author is Christian and her own religious beliefs come to the fore from time to time.<br /><br />While I enjoyed much of the plot, I think that the novel is written on a Young Adult level. I prefer historical fiction with more depth and objectivity. The characters are too simplistic for my taste.

This novel will introduce you to some fascinating individuals. You will read their compelling stories, watch them play-out, and see how they connect, like pieces of some great puzzle designed by a psychopathic sadist. This is a tale of murder most foul, blackmail, psychological torture, fear and more murder. Jan Burke creates three-dimensional evil here. It lives and breathes in one of her characters - a man she constructs of paper and ink on the printed page, who brings out my own childhood terrors of the dark and monsters who lurk beneath the bed - a terrifying malevolent golum of a human being. I've known a lot of fictional villains, and this one is grim indeed. He permeates the story with a sinister presence and leaves everyone, including the reader, with a sense of foreboding that lingers after the book's conclusion.<br /><br />I had never read an Irene Kelly mystery before, nor anything else by Jan Burke. I am fortunate that I began here, late in the series, because this novel goes back to Ms. Kelly' youth, where she begins as a reporter for the Las Piernas News Express. So now that I plan to read the entire series, I have had the opportunity to know her initially, as a young girl and professional. However, the beginning of the story does not take place in the spring of 1978, when Irene accepts a job at the Express, covering hard news. The story begins in January 1958.<br /><br />On January 4, 1958, Jack Corrigan, veteran reporter for the News Express, is almost killed after he is abducted from a cocktail party, severely beaten, and left for dead in the swamps near Las Piernas. Upon first regaining consciousness, he witnesses the burial of a bloodstained car in a farmer's field. He understands that he is hung-over, in pain, and concussed. However, in any state, he surely knows when he is seeing suspicious activity. With the little strength he has left, he investigates to make sure he is not hallucinating. The man driving the tractor sees him from a distance, and calls someone back to the scene to make sure Jack will never investigate again. The next day he is discovered, crawling out of the wetlands, looking and smelling like death. And he almost is - dead!<br /><br />That same night, a luxury yacht is lost during a storm at sea off the Las Piernas coast. Two bodies wash up within a short period. They were the Ducanes, a very wealthy couple and the boat's owners. Another couple was apparently on board with them - their son Todd and his young wife, Katy, who just celebrated her 21st birthday. Their bodies were never recovered and it was assumed, for lack of other evidence, that they also drowned. Katy and Todd's infant son was kidnapped that evening also. No ransom phone calls or letters were received. In fact no one was ever able to obtain information or clues leading to the whereabouts of the child. The nanny, who was caring for him, was found murdered in the nursery. Corrigan knew the baby's parents well, and had known Katy, and adored her, since her own infancy. She called him Uncle Jack and left property to him in her will. Needless to say, he was heartbroken, when he was well enough to hear the news.<br /><br />Twenty years later, in 1978, Irene Kelly comes to work for the Express, after a stint as a reporter in Bakersfield. Conn O'Conner, who had been Jack's protege, student, foster son and best friend since 1936, when he was an 8 year-old paperboy, now mentors Irene. The 1958 murders and kidnapping have never been solved. Rookie reporter Irene is sent out to cover the groundbreaking of a new shopping mall, and discovers something much bigger. The construction crew at the site uncovers a buried car containing human remains. O'Connor decides to work the story with Irene. She was there when the car was unearthed, asked the right questions and deals well with the difficult detective incharge of the case.<br /><br />\\"Bloodlines\\" explores the complex relationship between many of the characters who are first introduced in 1936, including the strong bond between Corrigan and O'Connor. There's another secondary but important mystery that began in the 1940s, when Conn's beloved sister, Maureen, was murdered. The crime was never solved. The mentor-protege relationship continues between Conn and Jack into the 1950s, however they're more like friends and colleagues. They work closely together, especially after Jack's beating. Then Conn mentors the young Irene in the 1970s and passes along what he had learned as they pick up more clues about the crimes committed in 1958. The book's last segment is set in 2000, when all loose strings are masterfully tied off.<br /><br />Jan Burke also explores here the history of the newspaper industry and the changes brought about with the growing popularity of television. Her writing is taut, her pace fast and fluid, and her characters are most original and likeable. She gives them depth, which along with a spellbinding narrative, makes this novel a real keeper. A definite 5 star recommendation!<br /><br />JANActive in charge of the case.  <br /> <br />\\"Bloodlines\\" explores the complex relationship between many of the characters who are first introduced in 1936, including the strong bond between Corrigan and O'Connor.

I was deeply moved by \\"After Moses: A Novel,\\" about three eccentric siblings and their off-beat parents, set in a small southern Ohio town. Riveted to the page, it didn't take me longer than 24 hours to reach the book's conclusion. At the end, I wasn't sure that the members of the Tumarkin family are that much stranger, or more neurotic, than anyone else. Their ideals, however, and their deeply held convictions on personal freedom, creativity, honesty, spontaneity, child rearing, and the deep abiding love and respect they have for each other, are 'weirdnesses' one should aspire to.<br /><br />Shoe (Susan) Tumarkin's murder is the catalyst which brings the novel's primary characters together. Shoe was the oldest of three siblings, the one who chose to live life on the edge. She was tough because she made herself so. \\"To combat the shackles of safety she confronted fear.\\" If she thought a particular situation held possibilities of humiliation, loneliness, pain or pleasure, she would seek it out, just to overcome the inherent danger. Conquering her fears did not feel like recklessness to her. She was able to overcome her fight or flight instincts - not altogether a good thing, certainly not for Shoe.<br /><br />She leaves behind a five year-old son, Moses, an intelligent, loving, observant boy who finds joy in life. It seems as if all the good traits of his relatives, combine to make this one small child. Moses might be the novel's strongest character.<br /><br />Ida is a talented artist, gifted, and in many ways the total opposite of her older sister. While Shoe moved where the wind took her, Ida has never left home. At 34 she has never held a regular job, never traveled except to a national park with her family on vacation. Nor has she had a boyfriend or romantic relationship. Her mind is where her adventures take place, and she enacts rich fantasies closer to home, by herself or with loved ones. \\"Her real life sprung from her imagination, like a strange and peerless flower fed on nothing more than rarified air.\\" Not comfortable with most people, Ida goes in disguise whenever she is called upon to make public appearances. Her paintings sometimes save people, sometimes bring them together, and sometime play a special role in a novel, like this one.<br /><br />Johnny, the youngest, is very like his two sisters, yet like no other. He is stubborn and won't be led, as was Shoe. He prefers to be alone, as does Ida. And many of his jobs allow him to be in the wilderness, on his own. Johnny is fiercely loyal and has good insight, especially into the characters of family members. And he is protective of those he loves.<br /><br />Shoe leaves a will, unusual for someone in their thirties. Her $85,000. insurance policy goes to Moses, along with most of the paintings Ida has given her. Three of the canvases go to Emily, her best friend. Johnny is bequeathed all her ski equipment, camping and climbing gear, and topo maps. Ida is to be Moses' guardian - the boy and his aunt adore one another. Moses' father is never mentioned or named. And finally, Shoe requests that if both Johnny and Emily are unmarried at the time of her death, that the two marry - each other.<br /><br />Although not a typical thriller-suspense novel, this book has all the tension and mystery of one. From early on, one is imbued with a sense of foreboding, especially after a tall charming stranger enters the family portrait.<br /><br />Karen Mockler's narrative is taut, but also lyrical, especially when describing the natural world. Her characters are so realistic and compelling, that they almost leap off the page. She vividly portrays the family's individual members and how they come to terms with life after Shoe's death, and after Moses comes to live with them. The Tumarkin family is a lure that is hard to resist. Mrs. Turmarkin retreats from the world with the death of her eldest daughter. It is Moses who brings her back, occasionally. Mr. Tumarkin, a college professor,withdraws into academic life. There is an electric quality, however, a wonderful energy, hovering over them all, even when stressed to the max.<br /><br />\\"After Moses\\" is ultimately about choices - about how one chooses to live life and what we do when most choices are taken away from us. This is an extraordinary novel and I highly recommend it.<br />JANAric quality, however, a wonderful energy, hovering over them all, even when stressed to the max.     \\"After Moses\\" is ultimately about choices - about how one chooses to live life and what we do when most choices are taken away from us.

Melanie Vargas, a young federal prosecutor in New York City's US Attorney's Office, and a brand new mother, stumbles onto a crime scene one steamy summer night while she is out walking her daughter, Maya. Police officers bustle outside a building, keeping crowds away, just a few blocks from Melanie's own apartment, while firefighters in full regalia hose down the remnants of a fire. Vargas recognizes the posh town house of Jed and Nell Benson, business acquaintances of hers. Jed had once been a famous prosecutor, almost a celebrity, then switched career paths and made a bundle of money in private law practice. His dead body was just discovered in his study, burned almost beyond recognition, but not enough to hide a bullet hole in his forehead and savage dog bites on his body. Melanie sees her friend and old college roommate, Sophie Cho, outside the crime scene. Sophie, an architect, had spent the last year renovating the building, and is devastated at the her employer's loss of life. She offers to take Maya home while Melanie investigates. Ambitious to further her career, Ms. Vargas wants in - she wants the case badly. This will be the high profile, headline-grabbing story of the year. The Benson's teenage daughter, Amanda, was also found at the scene, unconscious ,with a few fingers chopped off, and the maid had been beaten senseless. Both are in the hospital.<br /><br />Melanie finagles her way onto the murder scene and then lobbies her tough boss, for the case. She promises to work 24/7, putting herself in a bind obtaining last minute, off-hour childcare for Maya. She also keeps the lid on her marital situation, which is miserable. Husband Steve was caught in an extramarital affair shortly after the baby's birth and Melanie insisted on a temporary separation - still in effect. Steve very much wants to reconcile, but Melanie has mixed feelings about the nature of their relationship and his commitment to it.<br /><br />Dan O'Reilly, a very handsome, competent and caring FBI agent is assigned to work the case with her. There is instant chemistry between the two, and although both acknowledge the mutual attraction, they remain professional. The evidence leads them to investigate the C-Trout Gangsta Blades gang, and their sadistic kingpin Slice, who just happens to have a dog trained to kill. Additional information points to suspicious dealings at Benson's exclusive law firm and another motive. And a series of dangerous events, including the brutal murder of three witnesses, bring Melanie to the conclusion that there is at least one major leak high-up in the investigation. As work proceeds, the case becomes more complex and is not as open and shut as it had first appeared.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down. It is Michele Martinez's debut novel and she packs it with suspense, thrills and a riveting storyline. The mystery is an interesting one, although not too difficult to figure out. The development of her protagonist, and other characters, are what impressed me the most. Melanie is muy simpatica - an extremely intelligent woman, she is a Latina who was brought up on the mean streets of Bushwick, Brooklyn, and has a past which haunts her. She adores Maya and is thrilled with her new role as mother. Only now is she discovering how different her definition of marriage is from her husband's. She is attempting to overcome her hurt and confusion at his infidelity and do the right thing, making a major effort to ignore her growing feelings for Agent O'Reilly. Her strength of character, courage and tenacity assist her in getting through some really scary situations, and persisting until she solves this difficult case. Melanie typifies grace under pressure. Her sister Linda is adorable as the family's Latina princess, and O'Reilly is almost too good to be true. The villains run the gamut from bad news to animalistic sadistic psychopath.

326560:US	51247650	R207XHD4CYARZJ	0156007568	333681334	The Years with Laura Diaz	Books	3	7	7	N	N	I Expected A 5 Star Read & Was Disappointed	Like Carlos Fuentes' masterpiece, \\"The Death of Artemio Cruz,\\" \\"The Years With Laura Diaz\\" traces a migration from the state of Vera Cruz to Mexico City, during and after the Mexican Revolution. Here, however, the protagonist is not at all similar to the jaded revolutionary, Artemio Cruz, (who makes a cameo appearance in the novel). She is Laura Cruz, an artist and photographer, a woman of integrity, as well as a wife, mother and lover. Strong and vibrant, she manages to circumvent the Latin machismo which surrounds her and become a person in her own right, able to produce her own creative work, and to love with great abandon. In this sweeping historical saga, which spans a one hundred year period, Laura Cruz meets and mingles with all sorts of 20th century luminaries, like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, along with numerous political figures. Logically, history is portrayed through the eyes, experiences and ideology of Carlos Fuentes. He incorporates his views on the Mexican Revolution, socialism, Mexico's various workers' and labor movements, the Spanish Civil War, the Holocaust, McCarthyism and other important events which took place during the last century.<br /><br />Santiago Lopez-Alfaro, a young Mexican filmmaker, is in Detroit to make a documentary about Mexican muralists and their work in the US. He also wants to capture the decay of a great city, \\"the first capital of the automobile, no less, the place where Henry Ford inaugurated mass production of the machine that governs our lives more than any government.\\" He goes on to narrate, \\"I wanted to photograph the ruin of a great industrial center as a worthy epitaph for our terrible twentieth century.\\" While Santiago is absorbed, studying the Diego Rivera mural at the Detroit Institute of Arts, he recognizes a familiar face - that of his own, spirited great great-grandmother, Laura Diaz. He proceeds to investigate, chronicle and relive her story, through various personal tragedies, her development into a great artist, and several marriages and love affairs. Against this fictional backdrop, Fuentes juxtaposes important historical events. And Laura Diaz seems to always be at the center of everything. She's everywhere - a veritable witness to history, reminiscent of Woody Allen's Zelig. And 'History' is as much a protagonist in this novel as Sra. Diaz. Fuentes' narrative, as usual, is driven by the ideas his characters represent. He sacrifices their natural development, frequently, to make his political and historical points. Indeed, the documentation of political upheavals, the rise and fall of various Mexican governments, and the lack of social and economic reforms are a constant here. The focus on the political and philosophical interests of the characters, with long sections of debate, makes for some dry reading at times, and certainly hampers the narrative's flow.<br /><br />Laura Diaz was born in 1898 and comes of age during her country's revolution, in which her beloved brother, Santiago, was killed. She marries a prominent union leader, but when she becomes restless after nine years and two sons, her husband advises her to focus on the home and children, rather than help him with the Worker's movement. She finds temporary solace in an affair, becomes part of a bohemian circle and, after a year, finds an interesting job with Diego Rivera, an acquaintance. She decides the only way to save herself from the passive, boring life of forced idleness is through work. Rivera, Frida Kahlo and Laura travel to Detroit, where the great master is to create a mural. The continuing epic of Laura's life, loves, adventures is fascinating. There are colorful stories within stories, but Laura is essentially pulled along by the force of history.<br /><br />I was disappiointed with \\"The Years With Laura Diaz.\\" Carlos Fuentes is a favorite author, and I have read his work in Spanish. I was expecting another masterpiece and this does not measure up to his usual standard. It is not an easy book to read. The information included is interesting, but there's an overabundance of it, to the detriment of the characters' development. Our heroine, appears to be little more than an observer, a front for Fuente's portrait of a century.  The book is also very long. Although I usually enjoy long novels, especially when the prose flows, I felt like I was actually on a century-long journey myself, and couldn't wait for the conclusion - always a bad sign. For all it's epic quality,\\"The Years With Laura Diaz\\" left me with an empty feeling. Something crucial was missing. Perhaps I missed relating to three-dimensional characters.<br /><br />Carlos Fuentes, probably Mexico's greatest living writer, is the author of more than twenty books and  has received many awards for his accomplishments as a novelist, essayist, and commentator, among them the Cervantes Prize in 1987.<br /><br />JANAan easy book to read.

Laurell Hamilton dedicated \\"Obsidian Butterfly,\\" to her \\"Edward fans\\" - meaning that nice guy Ted Forrester, whose alter ego Edward, a sociopathic assassin, co-star, along with protagonist Anita, in this ninth novel in the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series. Edward, is a hit man specializing in monsters - vampires, lycanthropes, even an occasional human. He is an equal opportunity killer, a predator, no doubt about it. Monsters call him \\"Death,\\" but then they call Anita \\"Executioner.\\" Both have bad, but honest, raps in the world of the undead. Edward is also Anita's deadliest ally and good friend, when he's not fantasizing about killing her in a duel to the death to see which is faster on the draw. The book opens with a telephone call, Edward to Anita. He wants a favor. She owes him. He needs her help, backup assistance, in Santa Fe, NM, now. What else can Anita do, but go?<br /><br />Edward's sociable half, Ted, meets her at the airport. Ted Forrester is Edward's only legal identity, as well as the persona he assumes when dealing with most humans. He is a bounty hunter, it looks better on a business card than assassin. The ease with which Edward switches back and forth, between himself and the likeable Ted, is spooky. Then again, Richard Zeeman, Anita's primary love interest, switches to his werewolf form quickly. And vampire Jean-Claude, the other love...forgive me, I digress. But you get the drift. Ted, rather than Edward, meets Anita because his fiance and her two children are outside waiting for them. Engaged? Her name is Donna, a New Age, naive single mother with an adolescent son and a little girl who could pass for Shirley Temple. Ted must have popped the question while Edward was focused elsewhere, but both halves appear to be extremely attached to this Norman Rockwell-like family. Ted/Edward realize he is unable to maintain normalcy long enough to marry. Also, anyone he loves becomes a potential hostage for his numerous enemies.<br /><br />The New Mexican authorities, police and FBI, have asked Ted to assist them in an unspeakably savage serial murder case. The few survivors have been skinned alive and mutilated, the dead were brutally ripped limb from limb. Yeachh! Supposing that the predator(s) might be supernatural, Edward contacted Anita. Despite Anita's record as a consultant to the St. Louis Regional Preternatural Investigation Team, the bigoted local police resent her interference, especially the Lieutenant, who thinks she's a witch. Working alongside Edward and Anita are the backup team, Olaf and Bernardo. Olaf is an unrepentant rapist, who hates Anita on sight, especially since Edward thinks so highly of her. And hunky Bernardo is more than willing to have an extremely short-term, intimate relationship with her, which Edward strongly supports. He really wants her to distance from Richard and Jean-Claude.<br /><br />All known monster species are eliminated as possible perpetrators during the investigation, but there is definitely dark magic involved with the crimes. The clues point to magic which was once known to the Aztecs. The search takes our team from the local Vampire Queen, Itzpapalotl, to the nearest den of werewolves, their Ulfric and his pet \\"'witch,\\" a fellow necromancer, like Anita. Anita senses a power so strong it turns her blood cold, and has since day one. Ultimately, this is about good vs. evil. I'm rooting for the good guys, although sometimes it is hard to tell them apart. The thrills, chills and mystery along the way will rivet you to your seat, and your eyes to the page. Even with the obvious absence of the romantic triumvirate and the unusual suspects, \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\" provides an excellent read.<br /><br />My only complaint, are the initial 40 pages, which find Anita and Edward bickering, bantering, threatening, etc. Enough, Ms. Hamilton! We all know Ms. Blake is a tough lady. You bog the reader down with an unwieldy vaudeville act as an introduction to the story. This gets old realfast. I decided to rate the book 5 stars, however, because the storyline and narrative are spellbinding - even after the bad beginning.

Thursday Next, the LiteraTec, (literary detective), from \\"The Eyre Affair,\\" returns in \\"Lost In A Good Book\\" to ferret out and prevent literary fraud and forgery, protect the integrity of the existing literary tradition, as well as to provide delightful entertainment for the reader astute enough to seek her out. SpecOps officer Next lives and works in the alternate reality of  London, 1985, which is a familiar world in many ways. The people look much as they do now, although styles have a retro look. People watch TV, listen to their favorite music, go to work each day to pay the rent, and they still fall in love. However, the computer chip has not been invented nor has the jet engine, but time travel is common, so there is a police force which takes care of time travel-related crime. England and Czarist Russia have been at war, the Crimean,  for 131 years. It is England's Vietnam taken to greater depths...or heights. The Russian Revolution never happened, so no Cold War, Lenin, or Stalin...but serfs are still around, I guess. The national economy is dominated by Goliath, a monstrous corporate conglomerate, which prides itself upon its ability to provide the English with every material necessity - \\"Cots to Coffins: Goliath. All You'll Ever Need.\\" Oddly enough, the nation's favorite pastime is literature. These folks read big time! Many change their names to John Milton, Charles Dickens, George Gordon, Lord Byron, etc., and Shakespeare denialists abound.<br /><br />Even though she has become a sought after celebrity due to her her recent rescue, revision, (and improvement), of the novel \\"Jane Eyre,\\" Thursday's superiors are not particularly pleased with her performance. Even more distressing, her husband of one month, Landen Park-Laine, is eradicated - erased from time - by the monolithic Goliath Corporation, and she is the only person who remembers he existed. In order to save him, she must release the villain, she imprisoned in Poe's poem \\"The Raven.\\" Due to a series of events too bizarre to be merely coincidental, Thursday believes someone related to her old enemy, Acheron Hades, may be out to get her. Oh! Our heroine is newly pregnant and her pet dodo, Pickwick, lays an egg!<br /><br />Along the way to rescuing Landen, she becomes apprenticed to Miss Havisham, of \\"Great Expectations\\" fame, who has agreed to assist her. A limited stint in the Jurisfiction division improves her text-hopping skills nicely. Thursday also appears before the magistrate of Kafka's \\"Trial,\\" passes through \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" encounters the Cheshire Cat, escapes The Questing Beast, is involved in the discovery of Shakespeare's missing play, \\"Cardenio,\\" and learns the world may end in a fortnight. By the way, Armageddon may be pink!<br /><br />Jasper Fforde's sense of the absurd is extraordinary. He plots, un-plots and re-plots with almost demented fervor, and his prose is skilled and imaginative. His energy, and his joy in the written word, is contagious. Filled with intelligent puns, word play, and irreverence, \\"Lost In A Good Book\\" continuously delights.

A new power and another champion of Balance, Tehanu/Therru, is also introduced here. Tenar's reflections on her life, the nature of a woman's power and her own place in the world are major themes in the novel. Although \\"Tehanu\\" stands on its own, as do the other books in the Earthsea series, the story will be more enjoyable if the previous books are read first.<br /><br />Tehanu/Therru, a little girl who had been tortured, burned and left to die by her savage parents, is taken in and adopted by Tenar, now called Goha. She is a widowed mother of two, and a grandmother, living at Oak Farm on Gont, the home she shared with her deceased husband, Flint. The child is terribly disfigured, scarred both inside and out, and her new mother is doing all she can to earn her trust. Ogion, the mage of Re Albi, is dying and sends for Tenar, his beloved last pupil. He took her on as a student when Ged brought her to Gont many years before. The way of magic was not hers, however, and she left to become a wife and mother. Before Ogion dies, he sees an unusual strength, a special quality, in Therru and tells Tehanu to \\"Teach her all - not Roke.\\" Shortly after the mage's death, Ged returns on the back of the dragon Kalessin. Unconscious, near death after his fateful voyage into the Dry Lands, Ged has lost his power. Tenar takes the crippled man, her former companion, under her wing to nurse back to health.<br /><br />Ged's loss of magical power and his opportunity to explore new paths in life seem more of an advantage than not. \\"Tehanu\\" emphasizes Ged's rebirth, after his return from the dead, rather than his loss. As an Archmage, he sacrificed many of life's simpler, but rewarding, pleasures for power. At one point in a \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" he realizes he always wished to return to Gont - to forego \\"all wizardry and venture, forgetting all power and horror, to live in peace like any man on the known, dear ground of his home land.\\"<br /><br />However, just as all are healing, and as Arren is about to be crowned high king of Earthsea, danger stalks the former Archmage and his Priestess friend of old, along with the little girl they care for.<br /><br />Obviously, in the 17 years between \\"The Farthest Shore\\" and \\"Tehanu\\" Ms Le Guin continued to grow and develop with the times.

In Atuan, part of the Kargish lands, a little girl, Tenar, was chosen at birth to assume the role of One Priestess of the Tombs of Atuan, where the ancient Nameless Ones are said to dwell. The nine tombs had stood there, since the time of the first man, since Earthsea was created. \\"They were the tombs of those who ruled before the world of men came to be, the ones not named, and she who served them had no name.\\" When Tenar was five years-old, she was taken from her parents and formerly given to the Nameless Ones, her life until death was dedicated to them - the old gods. She was to become the High Priestess, reborn, of an ancient religion. And now she has no other name but Arha, the Eaten One.<br /><br />Her days are all the same, spent learning the endless rites and lore important to her position. Arha is separated from other neophytes, who have been sent to serve various gods, and soon grows bored and restless. Beneath her dwelling place, under the Throne and the Tombs, lies a vast labyrinth where hidden treasures are stored. She had been introduced to the hidden passageways when she reached her teens and now spends her days, alone, exploring this dark underground maze. It is here that one day she comes upon an intruder. Since it is forbidden for anyone else to walk under the Tombs, or to show light there, she is at first incredulous to see the area illuminated for the first time, and to note the presence of a stranger who stands where even other priestesses are forbidden. It is Ged who is there to recover a most priceless treasure - and to offer the young woman a wider destiny if she wishes it.<br /><br />The author emphasizes that Arha must make a decision whether or not to free herself from a dying cult - from the weight and darkness of the Nameless Ones. She must decide whether she is willing to work to recover her identity and her name. Ms. Le Guin again underscores the power of names that she introduced in \\"A Wizard of Earthsea,\\" along with the themes of light and shadow, good and evil.

Precious Ramotswe, at the conclusion of \\"Tears of the Giraffe,\\" the entrepreneurial private eye was happily engaged to Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, they were both making plans for a life together and bonding with their two foster children, the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency was firmly established, as was Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, Mr. Matekoni's business, and the horizon was filled with sunshine as far as the eye could see. How drastically things can change in just one book!<br /><br />\\"Morality for Beautiful Girls\\" finds trouble on both personal and professional fronts. Mr. Matekoni is going through a bout of depression and is temporarily unable to run his business. The detective agency, while enjoying tremendous success with clients and developing a fine reputation, is not making money. The couple decide to merge and reorganize! Mma. Ramotswe closes her detective agency's offices and moves her business, lock, stock and barrel into a small building adjacent to Speedy Motors. Mma Makutsi, who had already been promoted to assistant detective, is now appointed acting manager of the mechanical garage AND she runs the detective business while the owner is in the field detecting. Not surprisingly, the strong woman turns out to be an extremely efficient manager and a clever investigator. Mma. Makutsi is one of my favorite characters and the way she deals with the lazy, girl crazy mechanics is priceless. Meanwhile, Mr. Matekoni, who has been persuaded to see a doctor, is resting and working on getting his health back.<br /><br />An important Government Man enlists Mma. Ramotswe's services when he becomes convinced his younger brother is being poisoned. While she is out in the countryside working the case, the director of the Miss Beauty and Integrity of Botswana Contest asks Mma. Makutsi to help him with background checks for the contestants. He wants a \\"good girl\\" to win, someone who will not bring shame to the pageant or to Botswana. The problem is that according to the country's norms and moral codes, \\"good girls,\\" don't compete in beauty contests.<br /><br />As always, the mysteries may appear small but they deal with issues important to people's lives, and some of them are extremely thought-provoking and emotional. And for all their apparent simplicity, I find these books highly sophisticated. I really appreciate the way the author handles the topic of depression, and how the need to become informed and get appropriate treatment is emphasized.<br /><br />Mr. Smith also stresses the importance of empathy. When considering a friend who treats her maid badly, Mma Ramotswe thinks that \\"such behavior was no more than ignorance; an inability to understand the hopes and aspirations of others. That understanding . . . was the beginning of all morality. If you knew how a person was feeling, if you could imagine yourself in her position, then surely it would be impossible to inflict further pain.

The island of Gont, located in the stormy Northeast Sea, is a land famous for its wizards. Gont's most famous native son was Ged, called Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage. His life is told in the \\"Deed of Ged,\\" in many other stories and songs, and in this book.<br /><br />Duny, a boy from the village of Ten Alders, was fascinated by his aunt's small \\"women's\\" magic. She was the local witch, no dark sorceress, but someone of use to the townspeople with her herbs and simple spells. The boy seemed to have a natural inclination for magic, and his aunt taught him a variety of tricks. His innate skills were put to a test when hordes of vicious Kargs invaded his homeland. His quick thinking allowed him to tap into his limited repertoire and come up with a spell to enshroud the village and its inhabitants in fog. Thus they were invisible to the enemy and almost everyone was saved. Word of the deed spread until Ogion the Silent, the great mage of Re Albi who tamed an earthquake, finally heard of Duny. Ogion comes for the boy on his thirteenth birthday and gives him his \\"true name,\\" which is Ged. And Ged takes the use-name (nickname) of Sparrowhawk. Very few in this world know a person's true name, \\"because who knows a man's true name, holds that man's life in his keeping.\\"<br /><br />Ged travels with Ogion to Re Albi as his apprentice, learning to read and write the Six Hundred Runes of Hardic and proves to be an adept student. He finds he has developed a power which allows him to call animals. However, Ged is tempted by magic clearly forbidden to one so inexperienced, and makes a terrible mistake. From this incident, Ged and Ogion learn that he has become too powerful at too young an age and is not able to control the magic within. The boy decides to leave his beloved mentor and travel to Roke Island and the School (for sorcery). Here he studies under the Archmage Nemmerle, Warder of Roke and the nine Masters of Roke. He finds that a wizard's life is spent learning the true name of things in the old tongue. Power to a mage must be kept in balance. Every action has a reaction. Again, training goes extremely well for Ged until pride and willfulness cause him to step over the line again, and foolishly use power which he not yet mastered. This time the consequences are truly horrific and will have a lasting effect on his life.<br /><br />Ged must move on, past this trauma to body and spirit, and continue to seek wisdom while he prepares to confront his monsters. He must also serve as sorcerer to the people he made a contract with. His adventures along the way are thrilling, as is the novel's extraordinary climax. This is a phenomenal book!<br /><br />Although this novel, and the entire trilogy, have been classified as children's books, I don't know whether I totally agree with the label or classification. The plots may well be appreciated by children and adults alike, but the prose, the very language used to form the riveting storylines, is as rich and flavorful as dark Belgian chocolate. I had to stop several times to read descriptive passages aloud, to listen to the music of the narrative. The author paints a universe of landscapes with words, and they're as vivid in the mind's eye as seeing the real thing. The narrative voice is bard-like, as if relating a legend of long ago. Ms. LeGuin's exposure to Native American legends as well as Norse mythology is evident in her writing. She is the daughter of anthropologists and throughout her fiction there seems to be a deep understanding of how societies work, how they are built and evolve.

YOUR SATISFACTION GUARANTEED	The Republic of Botswana is located in Southern Africa, nestled between South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia. The largest exporter of gemstone diamonds in the world, Botswana is democratically ruled and has some of Africa's last great wildernesses including the famous Okavango Swamps and the Kalahari desert. The country's latest claim to fame is \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" whose owner, and our protagonist, Precious Ramotswe, is its only female detective - perhaps the only one in all of Africa - thus the agency's name.<br /><br />The delightfully cunning Mma. Ramotswe inherited a herd of cattle from her beloved father. She then sold the cattle and used the money to start her agency in Gaborone. Uncertain of her success as a female entrepreneurial sleuth, she was met with skepticism from all sides. \\"Can women be detectives?\\" asked the bank's lawyer. Her only capital assets are a tiny white van, two desks, two chairs, a telephone, an old typewriter, a teapot, and three teacups. Oh! And she owns the sign outside her office, which reads, \\"THE NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY. FOR ALL CONFIDENTIAL MATTERS AND ENQUIRIES. SATISFACTION GUARANTEED FOR ALL PARTIES. UNDER PERSONAL MANAGEMENT.\\"<br /><br />Precious Ramotswe, however, does have the \\"Right Stuff.\\" Her most valuable assets are intangible, but I'd take them to the bank any day. She is extremely intelligent, with outstanding intuitive capabilities (that sounds professional!). Possessing a keen perception of the human character, along with perseverance, and a strong set of values, she inspires trust in most all who meet her. She is also good woman with a kind heart. Most inspiring is her deep and abiding love for Africa, and for Botswana and its people in particular. \\"They are my people, my brothers and sisters. It is my duty to help them to solve the mysteries of their lives. That is what I am called to do.\\"<br /><br />This is not an ordinary crime novel/police procedural. Nor is it an edge-of-your-seat mystery thriller. Yes, Mma. Ramotswe is a private detective, but she manages to solve mysteries without the use of guns and violence, for the most part, preferring to use unorthodox solutions instead. Her cases may be small but they deal with issues important to people's lives, and some of them are extremely thought-provoking and emotional. A sinister event comes to her attention when a young boy goes missing. Mma. Romotswe will have to confront one of her country's most fearful traditions - the use of human bones to make powerful medicine.<br /><br />The narrative is written simply, in a clear, uncluttered style. And our Number One Detective is a pure delight, as are the people she deals with, and their everyday problems which she helps them resolve. The details of Mma. Ramotswe's background, her life before she began detecting, are intense and absorbing.

Ms. Roberts' detailed descriptions of Alaskan landscapes, during all the seasons - the glaciers which emit blue light, the \\"Mountain,\\" (McKinley, called Denali here), the long winter nights, snow and ice storms, the variety of color displays caused by the Northern Lights, (the Aurora Borealis), that celestial phenomenon of bands or streamers of colored light that appear in the sky predominantly in the Arctic and Antarctic regions of the earth, are simply phenomenal. It is also fascinating to read about the mechanisms people use, who live near the Arctic Circle, to survive and make normal lives for themselves, including going out for sports and to socialize in sub-zero weather.<br /><br />The novel's is set in Lunacy, Alaska, a tiny, quiet town, (pop. 506), whose inhabitants have worked hard to make sure they have all the institutions necessary for a civilized life. It is also of extreme importance for them to function and be self-sufficient when the weather cuts them off from the outside world. The Lunatics, (as the townsfolk call themselves), proudly claim a mayor, a school, a bank, one hotel, (The Lodge), with restaurant and one pizzeria called \\"The Italian Place,\\" a health clinic, fire department, weekly newspaper, radio station, small plane service, and a police force - minus a chief - which is why Baltimore Police Officer Nate Burke was hired for the job. The town's elders were looking for an outsider without a local or state agenda, and experienced detective Burke fit the bill. He was willing to move thousands of miles, to the middle of nowhere, away from any possibility of career advancement, because he is in bad shape - so to speak. Nate is recovering from the break-up of his marriage, and much worse, the traumatic shooting death of his longtime partner, for which he feels responsible, has left him reeling. He has been on the edge of a breakdown, seriously depressed, for quite a while.<br /><br />Burke settles in fairly quickly, especially due to the influence of bush pilot Meg Galloway, who catches his eye from the minute he first sees her. He has been alone for a very long time and, until now, disinterested in finding company of the female persuasion. This new relationship is different from anything Nate has ever experienced. And his feelings are reciprocated. Meg is drawn to the sexy, very competent cop with the sad eyes, who is more giving than any man she has known. Being with Meg helps to bring him back, emotionally, to the land of the living. She sees the two of them as an Alaskan Nick and Nora Charles.<br /><br />Work is interesting, but crime in Lunacy is far different from crime in Baltimore, although the locals are just as colorful, and far fewer. Then a frozen body, with an ice ax in its chest, is discovered in a cave on \\"No Name Mountain.\\" Meg identifies the corpse as her father, who she and the rest of the town's people believed deserted his family 16 years before. Shortly after this grim event, the well-liked newspaper publisher, Max, commits suicide, leaving a note on his PC confessing to the murder of Meg's dad. Nate believes that there is much more going on than the obvious, and that Max is innocent. Against almost everyone's wishes, he refuses to let the investigation die.<br /><br />This is a riveting suspense thriller with some serious romance. Nate Burke is an extremely sympathetic and complex protagonist. He is much more than the usual Alpha male hunk who plays the romantic lead. All the characters, in fact, are terrific, no matter their eccentricities,  including Meg's huskies, Rock and Bull. Ms. Roberts explores community bonds and the intimacy of small town life in the wilderness, which can test the soul.<br /><br />My one problem with the book is that the narrative is way too long, especially the first 100 plus pages. Filler is not necessary in this novel and tighter writing could only enhance the story.<br /><br />JANAr is not necessary in this novel and tighter writing could only enhance the story. <br />JANA	2005-02-20

After finishing James Rollins' \\"Sandstorm,\\" my first book by the author, I couldn't wait to read another of his novels.

However,\\" Ice Hunt's\\" exotic wildlife, the rationale and priorities of several characters, and the manner in which many problems are resolved, left me incredulous, and at times rolling my eyes!<br /><br />The USS Polar Sentinel, a brand new sub and test model for future generations of attack vessels, is presently being utilized for scientific research. A startling discovery is made during a routine mission. The sub's equipment detects a vast inverted ice mountain containing a secret scientific laboratory. It is an abandoned polar station, originally built and utilized by the former Soviet Union during and after WWII. The base was actually constructed inside the ice. The Polar Sentinel's commanding officer decides to occupy the station to explore, conduct research, discover the reason for the station's highly confidential existence, and the reason why the Soviet scientists, who once worked here, had been left to die tragically - their fate unknown, even to their families.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a Russian admiral, the son of the man who was once in charge of the polar station, is on another submarine - this one Russian, making its way toward the now US occupied polar station. He has dangerously original plans of his own for the future of the base, the iceberg and the Arctic polar ice cap.<br /><br />Max Pike, a Fish and Game officer cataloging bear populations in the remote Brooks Range, who is also a former Green Beret, (convenient), finds a small plane, which has been shot out of the sky. Matt rescues the only survivor, who says he is a journalist traveling to the polar station. They barely have a  chance to exchange names when they find themselves relentlessly pursued by black clad Russian special forces, who aim to kill. Somewhere along the way, Matt's Inuit ex-wife, her father, and their dog join the  two men, and attempt to escape their pursuers in the ex-wife's airplane. Eventually everyone winds up at the polar base.

September 11 dramatically altered many people's perspectives on life and the world around us. The horrific events which occurred on that beautiful mid-September morning in 2001 changed John Perkins, author of  \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man.\\" Mr. Perkins, a highly respected economist, had once worked as chief economist at Chas. T. Main, an international consulting firm in Boston. Even though he worked for a private corporation, he was sent abroad under government contracts to convince leaders of developing countries, places of strategic importance to the US, such as Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Panama, Ecuador, etc., to accept enormous \\"loans\\" from the United States. The money would then be used to pay American companies to build local infrastructure and other projects. So while American corporations were profiting from these \\"loans,\\" the countries were sinking into overwhelming debt. The poorest people, who benefited least from these projects, were the ones stuck with the responsibility for payment. These countries usually became US puppet regimes, open to American corporate manipulation. If a leader refused to play the game, the consequences could be lethal. This is blatant economic blackmail - where your best buddy turns out to be the vindictive loan shark.<br /><br />Perkins resigned from the job about 20 years ago, because morally and ethically, he felt it was \\"wrong to play such a key role in creating an international empire at the expense of the poor and less advantaged around the world.\\"<br /><br />The author was paid extremely well to be an \\"economic hit man,\\" as he describes the position. He worked alongside the heads of the IMF, World Bank, and other notable global financial institutions. Perkins began writing a book shortly after he resigned, with the working title, \\"Conscience of an Economic Hit Men.\\" He wanted to dedicate the book to Jaime Rold&oacute;s Aguilera, former president of Ecuador, and Omar Torrijos Herrera, former president of Panama. He had enormous respect for both men, held them in high esteem, and thought of the two as \\"kindred spirits.\\" Unfortunately, Roldos and Torrijos had both been his clients. They both died in fiery plane crashes. According to Perkins, their deaths were not accidental. They were assassinated, targets of the CIA, because they opposed the goals of corporate, government, and banking leaders, which were, and are, to build and maintain a global empire. The CIA has long assisted American corporations to remain dominant in foreign markets, by overthrowing governments hostile to unregulated capitalism.<br /><br />In the early 1970s, the Royal House of Saud agreed to send most of their petro-dollars back to the United States and invest them in U.S. government securities. The Treasury Department used the interest from these securities to hire U.S. companies to develop Saudi Arabian infrastructure, and the House of Saud agreed to maintain the price of oil at reasonable limits. In return, the US would use its resources to keep the House of Saud in power.<br /><br />After attempting to implement something similar to the Saudi policy in Iraq, and failing, US industry, in concert with government, wanted to depose Saddam Hussein. Saddam did not play ball. When the \\"economic hit men\\" were not able to convince the infamous dictator to cooperate, CIA \\"jackals\\" went in to foment revolution or a coup. It was not so easy, however, to overthrow or kill Saddam. His bodyguards were too good and he used doubles. Perkins draws the conclusion, based on his experience, knowledge and hard facts, that the present Iraqi war was our next step. He cites the billions of dollars in US government contracts awarded to US corporations, like the Bechtel Group Inc., and Halliburton Company's subsidiary Kellog Brown & Root.<br /><br />The author was persuaded and even bribed to refrain from writing this book about his professional experiences. And, although he began to write on various occasions over the intervening years, he did stop. World events, such as the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1980, the first Gulf War, Somalia, and the rise of Osama bin Laden, convinced him to put his manuscript aside, again and again. Perkins stated in a recent interview with Pacifica Network's Democracy Now program, \\"When 9/11 struck, I had a change of heart.\\" He concluded the interview  by saying, \\"I believe the World Bank and these other institutions can be turned around....We can change that.\\"<br /><br />Perkins' tale is a gripping one and the international and political intrigue involved gives the non-fiction book the feel of a suspense thriller. The narrative is very well written and fast-paced. I am only a reviewer reporting about what I read. I didn't write the book - just the review. If you are unhappy with the author, or his point of view, please don't blame me, the messenger. I do highly recommend \\"Confessions Of An Economic Hit Man.\\" Whether you like Mr. Perkins or not, he has some very valuable information and insights to share.

He always adds something extra to his novels besides an original, fast-paced plot. Brown explores unique themes/topics, whether it be the mysteries of the Holy Grail and secrets of the Knights Templar, NASA politics, or discovering life on other planets, that add tremendous depth to his storylines. I think some readers take his work too seriously, however. After all, his books are fiction - novels where one is required to suspend belief to some degree. Brown's background research is quite competent. I have read both \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Deception Point\\" and found them to be super suspenseful and filled with fascinating new ideas. \\"Angels and Demons\\" is another page-turner.<br /><br />Robert Langdon, (also a character in \\"The DaVinci Code\\"), a renowned Harvard symbologist, is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze an obscure symbol branded into the chest of a murdered physicist. The dead scientist's final achievement had been the discovery of antimatter, \\"the most powerful and deadly source of energy known to man.\\" Langdon is able to identify the symbol. He also finds that the labs supply of antimatter, the only specimens in existence, has disappeared. Then the Pope dies suddenly. Cause of death is determined to be murder - an almost indiscernible murder. Langdon learns of a deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church by a centuries-old underground organization - The Illuminati. This organization, has existed since Galileo's time to promote the interests of science over religion. The antimatter is hidden underneath Vatican City on the eve of a Papal election, and it is scheduled to explode, threatening lives as well as all the historical documents and art that the Vatican contains.<br /><br />Robert Langdon, and Vittoria Vetra, the dead scientist's daughter, begin an exhausting search, with an impossible deadline, through the streets, churches and catacombs of Rome to prevent the disaster, find the Illuminati leadership and the murderer(s).<br /><br />Once again, Brown had me intrigued with his scientific and historical detail, Church politics, and high tech-mania.

The novel spans the period between the American Civil War and the end of World War I. Adam Trask grew up with his brother, Charles, on a farm in Connecticut. Their father clearly favored gentle Adam throughout their lives, leaving Charles, the wilder and more violent of the two boys, bitter and envious. Charles loved his father and brother deeply, but could never elicit the old man's affection. The jealousy he felt towards Adam gnawed at him constantly, and he finally left home to join the army. The brothers did not see each other for many years. Whenever Charles came home they argued relentlessly. And again Charles would go away. Finally, their father died, leaving both sons a fortune.<br /><br />Cathy Ames, a narcissistic, manipulative girl with few redeeming characteristics, plays a profoundly symbolic role in this Steinbeck novel. When she showed up at the Trask home one evening, beaten and close to death, Adam nursed her back to health. Gulled by Cathy's seeming vulnerability and beauty, he married her. She got him drunk on their wedding night, and while he slept, she had sex with Charles. Adam bought some land outside of Salinas, California, and moved there with his unwilling wife. He wanted to create an Eden for his Eve. Pregnant, and miserable at the thought of becoming a mother, Cathy tried to abort and failed. She stayed in Salinas long enough to give birth to fraternal twins, Aron and Caleb. Soon after their birth, Cathy abandoned her family, shooting her husband in the chest before exiting. Adam was so disturbed by the loss of his wife that he wanted little to do with his sons. The boys were raised by Lee, an Asian hired hand, who cared for them as his own. Samuel Hamilton, a neighbor and local philosopher, visited Adam frequently, attempting to jolt him out of his depression. On one occasion the two men discussed the biblical story of Cain and Able, Mr. Steinbeck's metaphor for this novel.<br /><br />Like their father and uncle, the twins constantly vie for their father's attention. Aron meets a young woman at school and becomes deeply attached to her. She is the first woman to show him affection. Caleb is beside himself with jealousy...and longing.<br /><br />The ensuing conflicts, and unnecessary alienation, between Aron and Caleb are heartbreaking. There is a painful scene when Adam repeats history, and tells Caleb, in spite of all the young man's efforts to please, that he should be more like his brother. The novel, however, does ends on a note of hope and redemption.<br /><br />I don't think Steinbeck's main characters are as fully developed, or as complex, as they could be because he is so intent on drawing similarities between them and their Biblical counterparts. In his retelling of the Cain and Abel story, Adam, Charles, Cathy, Aron and Caleb, are forced to reenact the ancient drama of exile from Eden. However the Biblical references are interesting, and the plot and subplots are tension-filled and moving. His secondary characters, Lee, Samuel, Abra, are beautifully drawn, realistic portraits of believable people. Their stories, histories and motives, are fascinating and add much to this deeply moving masterpiece by John Steinbeck.<br /><br />JANAempting to jolt him out of his depression.

Most diets don't work. Why? Because the people who follow the diets are dieting. We deprive ourselves of the food we love until we reach a goal. That could take years! Or we eat the foods we love in minute portions, mere tastes. Does one half cup of Godiva's Belgian Dark Chocolate ice cream satisfy anyone? If one chooses to stick with a diet program forever, an almost permanent state of slimness occurs. Voila!  Forever is a long time to live with deprivation...to state the obvious. And usually somewhere between resolution and goal, comes the binge. But I won't go there. Almost all of us have experienced this seeming endless cycle of weight management. Dieting is our national obsession! According to Mireille Guiliano's fascinating and sensible book, however, one can moderate and modify behavior and eat sensually - like the French. Bid deprivation adieu. Savor the food and wine you love and loose the fat you hate.<br /><br />\\"French Women Don't Get Fat: The Secret of Eating For Pleasure\\" holds no secrets - no new weight loss methods are revealed here. REALLY! As a matter of fact, from page one, the author distances herself from all the popular fad diets. Mireille Guiliano, President and CEO of Cliquot Inc., (the major French Champagne house), who helped found the firm in 1984, is an extremely smart, savvy woman and tres chic to boot! Everything she writes here rings true, makes perfect sense and is beautifully penned. \\"French Women Don't Get Fat,\\" (which is not totally true - I saw some pretty hefty women, even in Paris!), makes for a good read, provides food for thought, more than a soupcon of wit, and some wonderful recipes: Zucchini Flower Omelet, Aasparagus Tart, a Plum Clafouti made without dough, Salad of Duck a l'Orange, Grilled Peaches with Lemon Thyme, Chicken au Champagne, Croissants, and even Mousse au Chocolat.<br /><br />\\"The French Paradox,\\" the ability to eat good food, drink fine wine, (or beer), and remain slim is apparently a matter of attitude, with a smidgeon of wisdom and a pinch of common sense thrown in for good measure. The French are notorious for wining and dining, yet they are thinner and healthier than calorie conscious Americans - and Brits too! Mireille attributes the French women's penchant for slimness to their attitude toward food, which focuses on the best and freshest ingredients consumed in moderation, and frequent, brisk walking. It is all a matter of restraint and simple exercise. Madame Guiliano quotes Colette, who once described the table as \\"a date with love and friendship.\\" Be good to yourself, be good to your body, and enjoy! This is Mireille's basic message. One of the main messages I received from the book is \\"savor, don't stuff.\\" (my words - the author is infinitely more couth).<br /><br />The emphasis is on the positive - more dos than don'ts. But you know all this - right? Do eat slowly. Do drink wine with meals, (one glass), along with a glass of water. Eat plenty of fruit, veggies, et la salade vert. Oui? Eat three meals a day. And indulge yourself occasionally, with moderation. Have 3/4 of a cup of ice cream, and if you are having a salad for lunch with olive oil and vinegar, or fresh lemon juice, indulge in a full cup! As for chocolate, and she is a big chocolate fan, eat it, relish it. Hold it in your mouth and let it melt; exercise those taste buds. Don't eat on the sly, as we sometimes tend to do. Food does not taste as good when served along with a portion of guilt. There's hardly a mention of calories in the entire book. Refreshing!<br /><br />Mireille does share personal anecdotes, memories of growing up in a close knit family with a mother and grandmother who cooked. One of her stories, in particular, remains with me. She came to the US when she was 18 and spent a year as an exchange student in the affluent Boston suburb of Weston, MA. And did she ever discover the joys of brownies, chocolate chip cookies, bagels, and American-sized portions. She gained 20 pounds that year. Her father didn't recognize her when she returned to France. He told her she looked like a sack of potatoes. Cruel? Honest. This made an impression on the young woman, which remains with her to date. She did something about it too, with the help of her family physician. A natural raconteur, Ms. Giuliana also shares memories of her first taste of champagne at age six, picking tiny wild blueberries, (called myrtilles), in the woods near her grandmother's house, and a most memorable experience eating oysters at a seaside restaurant in Brittany.<br /><br />While I never lived in France, Mireille's US food anecdote reminded of a period when I lived in Italy, (the home of pasta and gelato). My experience, however, was the opposite of her's. I ate as I pleased and did not gain an ounce. I was in my 30s, (not a teen who burns up calories by breathing), and had a six month business contract in Rome. I ate three squares per day, including pasta, pastry, gelato, wonderful Italian wine, of course, and aqua minerale. The portions were much smaller than they are here and were served separately and slowly. There was time to savor. There was no fast food on my daily menu. Why would I want any with all the wonderful fresh food available? And I never needed larger portions than what was served. It seems that in our culture more equals better. My change in eating habits had to do with change of culture, primarily, as did Mireille's when she lived in America. We have wonderful fresh food here also - it's just a matter of changing our attitude toward food, portion control, and ignoring the fast and greasy.<br /><br />This is the ultimate non-diet book. It is up-beat, life affirming, sensible and I really enjoyed reading it! You will too!!<br /><br />**As an interesting sequeteur: In the EU, France has the lowest percentage of deaths caused by excess weight (5.8%), while the UK has the highest (8.7%). Figures presented to Parliament in a National Audit Office, (NAO), note that, \\"Nearly two thirds of men and over half of women in England are now overweight or obese.\\"<br /><br />According to a  major US government report, \\"Fitness problems such as obesity and overweight have reached truly epidemic proportions in the United States.

Mark Rubin, a modern Orthodox Jew, a loving husband and father, a wealthy furrier, believed himself the most fortunate of men. He thought he had the perfect family and a near flawless marriage. When his beautiful wife, Natalie, and their three children, Isaac, Penina and Efraim go missing, with no sign of foul play, the police back away from the case. The official point of view is that Mrs. Rubin probably packed-up and left with their children, whom Mark adores. This is totally incomprehensible to him. In desperation, Rubin turns to Baltimore PI Tess Monaghan, a former reporter for the Baltimore Star. She agrees to take the case, with some skepticism. Detective Monaghan has a gut feeling her new client has not been totally forthcoming with the details. He doles out vitally important information, reluctantly, in piecemeal fashion. She initially views him as a cold, controlling man, and has a bit of difficulty working with him because of their cultural differences. He just rubs her the wrong way. Also, there are very few clues on which to base the investigation. On the other hand, Tess needs the money.<br /><br />Tess' full name is Theresa Esther Weinstein Monaghan. The Weinstein part of the name comes from her mother. Tess is \\"half\\" Jewish and her interaction with the Orthodox Rubin causes issues of her own to surface. She is somewhat familiar with Jewish tradition, as she is with the Monaghan family's Christianity. While not particularly observant in either religion, she finds herself reflecting on the roles faith, culture, and religion play in her own family. She realizes the importance of understanding this aspect of Mark Rubin's life in order to succeed with the investigation. Tess' Uncle Donald recommended her for this particular job. He spent years working with Ruben in a volunteer program that instructed Jewish prisoners in rituals and traditions. Eventually, other members of the program will be called upon for their assistance in resolving the mystery.<br /><br />Tapping into a national network of \\"sister\\" investigators on her PC, (the SnoopSisters), Tess soon learns the location of the Rubin family. However, it seems a fifth member has been added to the entourage, a man described by witnesses as \\"handsome,\\" \\"charming\\" and otherwise unremarkable. Little do they know. It soon becomes apparent that underneath the illusion of  family bliss lies a web of deceit. Nothing is as it seemed. Suddenly the search becomes precarious and takes on a new urgency. Lives may be at stake.<br /><br />This is Tess' eighth case and she has established quite a professional name for herself. She is recognized as a professionally competent PI, but unfortunately the same cannot be said about her personal life. Tess continues to be commitment phobic. Her very cool boyfriend, Crow, is taking a break. He's out of town visiting his mom who has been quite ill. Tess also has a problem with the impending marriage of her Aunt Kitty. \\"By A Spider's Thread\\" finds her alone with her two dogs, recovering from her last case's very heavy baggage and puzzling over this new job. However, Ms. Monaghan is more than a semi-neurotic, feisty detective. The lady has depth. She has evolved into a complex, vulnerable, substantial woman of wit and some significant wisdom. This latest novel, just nominated for the 2005 Edgar Award, is the best, most spellbinding Tess Monaghan mystery yet.<br /><br />Multi-award winning author Laura Lippman is golden at creating and developing her characters, and it is precisely this strength that gives her plots depth and believability. Her people are not always likeable or sympathetic, but they're the real thing - human! She gives just enough clues and information to keep the suspense escalating, the tension building, but she does not give up her mysteries easily. I was absolutely riveted by this complex, multi-layered plot which holds surprises, chills and even a few laughs.

Mikels' novel, \\"Dawn of the Transcendence\\" takes a nameless youth through a personal coming of age journey, and a second more mystical adventure. Both involve growth, spiritual awareness and finally, transcendence.<br /><br />The teen, called the Youth, is a loner, an outsider in school as well as in his own family. He is in the throes of discovering his adolescent sexuality, with much guilt, and is unable to express his thoughts and feelings to anyone. As far as females are concerned, he doesn't have a clue as to what they're about, nor does he relate well to most people. Yet, in his earnest struggles for maturity, he is an extremely sympathetic figure. The Youth's search for meaning, for love and guidance bring him to a small New Mexican town where he unexpectedly and literally travels to the heavens for enlightenment. It is here he experiences the dawn of his transcendence.<br /><br />This is D. Mikels first novel. It is well written, original, and thought provoking. Mikels deliberate use of symbolism as a vehicle to explore moral transformation is fascinating. The narrative contains some fantastical elements, however, which do challenge believability. And sections of Part 2 express rather fervent political views, more fitting in an essay than a novel. I am reminded of Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" I so enjoyed the book, but the last section was a political thesis that I had problems with in the context of the novel. Overall, this is an excellent debut. I have read the author's second novel, \\"Walk-On\\" where he demonstrates tremendous maturation as a writer. Mikel's career as an author is one to follow!

When she was eight years-old, her father walked into the sea, never to be seen again. She and her mother often sit on the beach, near the ocean's edge where his footprints were last seen, watching - waiting for him to return. Wet footprints appear to her in the oddest places, convincing her that he has come back. He had told her that she was a mermaid - a gift from the sea. After all these years, she still believes him and reasons that if her father is alive, then he must be a creature of the sea and that she, his daughter, must be the same. And like the mermaids in Hans Christian Andersen's tale, and Friedrich de La Motte Fouque's \\"Undine,\\" our lost young protagonist loves a man and longs for him to return her intense affections. Unlike the fairy tales, however, one assumes she is not dependent on this man's love to gain a mortal soul.<br /><br />Jude, the man in question, is older, nearly twice her age. He returned from the Iraq War terribly changed, war-torn. After serving three years and seven months in the Army, he had decided to stay at the front a bit longer. He needed the money. He was finally evacuated for Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome and shipped back to the States. The bleak, Northeastern seaside town where they live has nothing to offer him, nor anyone else really. He doesn't own a fishing boat, which is the only way to make money in the tiny hamlet. Our mermaid is certain that Jude, now a hard drinking, womanizing sailor, is her prince. Jude, however, has problems of his own. Never having fully recovered from the traumas of battle, he believes the young woman is forbidden to him. She is like a critical war secret he has been prohibited to reveal. \\"Like if I say your name or if I touch you, I'd get court-martialed, found guilty, and executed.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Hunt's narrative is sparse and somewhat random in nature, according to her protagonist's apparent whims. It almost reads like a personal journal, with chapter titles for each entry. A literary work, \\"The Seas\\" is hauntingly beautiful with lyrical, almost ethereal prose and filled with ocean imagery. An atmosphere of melancholy permeates, with mystical, fantastical elements. The young woman's angst, and the sorrows of her wounded warrior, wrench the heart.

He's a bright kid who dreams of cutting-out from his dead-end existence someday. At nineteen, Strike's world is all about economic survival on the streets. He runs drug crews for Rodney, his kingpin boss. Unfortunately, Strike is not able to slough off the hassles of the daily hustle. He is already a man of means with teenage employees who report to him, and more worldly cares than he can handle. He suffers from stomach ulcers and is constantly drinking vanilla Yoo-Hoos to soothe the almost constant pain. Then Rodney asks him to kill another clocker who is skimming money. He tells Strike that this hit will be the key to getting ahead in the organization.<br /><br />Rocco Klein is a burnt-out, middle-aged homicide detective who drinks too much and has the home life from hell. He too dreams of a better future, while patrolling the rough New Jersey neighborhoods where drug killings are almost a daily occurrence. When yet another homicide occurs, a young man with two jobs, a clean record, and a family, confesses to shooting the street tough. Klein does not believe for a minute that twenty year-old Victor Dunham is guilty. However, he likes Victor's brother, Strike, for the job. He pressures Strike to either confess or to give up the real killer.

SS Sturmbannfuhrer Erich Kaempffer has just received a promotion and a plum new assignment. After a year's tutelage at Auschwitz, learning how to run an efficient concentration camp and implementing the Reich's final solution, Heinrich Himmler has rewarded him with a death camp of his own. Romania's new Division of Race and Resettlement is going to be busy for the next year or so, rounding up Jews, gypsies and other undesirables to transport to the facility, now under construction, in Ploiesti, north of Bucharest. It is April 1941.<br /><br />Then word comes through that Kaempffer is to make a detour. A small regular German army detachment under the command of Captain Klaus Woermann is stationed in an ancient castle, the Keep, in the Dinu Pass, a remote area of the Transylvanian Alps. The location is of interest to the Germans because of its strategic position to nearby oil fields. The captain had sent a communique to Headquarters in Berlin: \\"Request immediate relocation. Something is murdering my men.\\" The SS major must make the inconvenient trip to investigate, along with a contingent of his einsatzkommandos (SS goons).<br /><br />Kaempffer and Woermann had known each other since their teens, when they fought together in the Great War. Woermann, a regular army officer and non-party member, had distinguished himself in WWI as a hero. Kaempffer, a fanatic Nazi, had not. Now their soldiers keep dying, both army and SS, each in a manner more gruesome than the one before. Clearly something supernatural is involved which is brutally sucking the life from living souls. The Keep's occupation by foreign soldiers, and their continual tampering with the castle's structure while searching for \\"hidden gold,\\" have released an evil entity - the MOST EVIL entity. When a message is found, written in blood in an unknown language, it is decided an expert must be called in to assist the investigation. Unfortunately for everyone, the SS major refuses to abandon the Keep, as this may look like a failure to Heydrich, Himmler and cohorts. An elderly, sickly Jewish scholar from Bucharest, knowledgeable about Romanian history, folklore and extinct languages, is ordered to the castle. Accompanying him is his lovely daughter, Magda.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in Tavira, Portugal, a red-haired man awakens from a nightmare with a sense of foreboding. Grim-faced, he suddenly understands. He had hoped this moment would never come, but he is ready. He is called Glaeken, and he begins his trip across the 2300 mile length of Mediterranean Sea, through Turkey to Romania, immediately. Soon another war will begin, one which will rival even Hitler's war.<br /><br />Parts of \\"The Keep\\" are extremely scary, horrifying actually. A fantasy element is also present in the explanation of the evil \\"entity's\\" history, and Glaeken's, along with the building of the Keep. I found this to be fascinating stuff. During these segments the novel is fast-paced and riveting. However, there are areas of the narrative which plod, and while I enjoyed the romantic subplot, I am pretty sure hard core horror fans will not. The gratuitous gore, is just that - unnecessary, and becomes almost comical at times - especially since the gore belongs to Nazis. Overall, I did enjoy this. It is not a masterpiece of horror but it will certainly hold your attention. Recommended!<br /><br />JANAmay look like a failure to Heydrich, Himmler and cohorts.

Abigail Buwell sits by her blue roan and thinks: \\"I could have said this, that I was born, truly born, under a sky of shooting stars, beside a herd of grazing horses wearing moonlight on their coats. That the air smelled of water and juniper, and that I was born like this, whole. That I had lived only for some four years: that was the span of my true life.\\"<br /><br />Totally against her will, Abigail Buwell was redeemed from Indian captivity by an abusive brother-in-law whom she feared and hated. Her lawfully wedded husband - in name only - had died four years before, on the day she was captured. Three Indian braves were traded for Abigail and another woman - one who was glad to be rejoining \\"civilization.\\" Almost nine months pregnant, Abigail was forced to leave behind her small child, a man who cared for her, and the People, the only family she had ever really known. While one woman hated her captors and simply endured, Abigail found kindness, love and laughter for the first time in her young life. She left the tribe with the child in her womb, her magnificent blue roan, and the name given to her by the Indians, \\"She-Who-Was-Dreamed-By-The Blue-Horse.\\"<br /><br />US Military Outpost 2881 stood at the furthest edge of the frontier under the command of Major Robert Cutter, a Civil War veteran. There upon the barren, desolate plains, guarding a hostile somber-colored space, dwelled a contingent of military men, two women - the doctor's sick wife and the washerwoman, Maria - and a greedy sutler. It was to this place that Abigail Buwell was brought, and where she said, \\"I will not live among you.\\" Major Cutter was the only one who heard. She didn't speak again.<br /><br />Seemingly forgotten by mankind, and perhaps by God, the fort had been rife with illness. The Quartermaster and many others had died during an epidemic of meningitis. Almost all the food and fresh water were gone and no supply wagons in sight. There had been insubordination and desertion in the ranks. The men were in a stupor, unshaven, filthy, infested with vermin - shadows of their former selves. And the major, who had never fully recovered from the war, was unable to take control and improve conditions, if that were a possibility. Cutter had totally fallen apart - alienated, isolated, living in his own grim inner world, inhabited by ghosts, unable to cope with the even darker realities of the outpost. Among his papers was found, much later, a disturbing list he devised of \\"Good\\" and \\"Evil\\" - a telling example of his state of mind. He felt a kinship to Abigail, but her silence, emotional withdrawal and open hostility, pushed him further into himself and provoked hallucinations. He knew that neither of them had a future. The soldiers were immediately suspicious of Abigail, especially when her fellow hostage, the other woman who had been rescued, called her a \\"savage.\\" Violence threatened to break out. Mutiny was in the air, but the men were too weak to act - for the moment<br /><br />Melanie Wallace's insights into the human heart are astute, powerful and cut to the soul. Her well crafted narrative paints a bleak and brutal picture of post-Civil War life on the remote frontier. The landscapes of the Great Plains are fantastical, nightmarish.

Anita Blake, Executioner, necromancer, lover and human servant to Jean-Claude - the charismatic Master Vampire of St. Louis, lupa of the Thronnus Roke Clan lukoi, and Nimir-ra of a pard of leopard lycanthropes, is changing...more so all the time. When Laurell Hamilton introduced her to us in \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" Book One of the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series, she was a 24 year-old, smart, attractive, feisty, super-independent dynamo, who raised the dead for a living. She was almost a normal 21st century career girl. Of course she staked rogue vampires as a sideline, but we all have our quirks. Anita's preternatural powers have been steadily increasing, and in \\"Blue Moon,\\" book eight in the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series, the lines are really beginning to blur between her humanity and the supernatural. Always an uncompromising and tough lady, she has developed a hardness, a detachment, that frightens even herself.<br /><br />Anita, Richard Zeeman, (an alpha werewolf and her old boyfriend), and Jean-Claude, (her present lover), had formed a Triumvirate of power - Master Vampire, Ulfric and necromancer. In other words, when the three connect, they exude tremendous force and are able to do much more magic than any one or two can do alone. The three are still bound to each other, even though Richard is furious with Anita for dumping him. She had to choose between \\"a flesh eater and a bloodsucker.\\" Do you see a pattern here?<br /><br />Late one evening Anita receives a phone call from Richard's brother. Zeeman had been spending the summer in Meyerton, Tennessee, studying the Lesser Smokey Mountain Trolls which live in the area, and fulfilling the requirements for his Masters degree. He has been arrested for the rape of a local women, and is obviously innocent of the charge. Richard is squeaky clean, the ultimate Boy Scout, and very gentle, especially for a lycanthrope. To make the situation worse, a full moon will occur in five days. As luck would have it, this month, August, is a blue moon month - that means two full moons in 31 days - a phenomenon which arises every 3-4 years. And we all know what happens to werewolves during a full moon, don't we? Richard has not \\"come out of the closet,\\" so to speak, to his parents, his employers, or to many other humans. Basically, he needs to get out of jail pronto. Anita flies down to Meyerton to give him a hand and get him a good attorney. At Jean-Claude's insistence she is accompanied by an entourage of body guards. Colin, the master of the local vampires does not want Anita and cohorts on his turf - for any reason and has made some serious threats. So, vampires Asher and Damian, and lycanthropes Jason, Zane, Cherry, and Nathaniel are there to keep her safe - although, as always, Anita turns out to be the one who does the most protecting. Werewolves Jamil and Shang-Da are around for Richard, to assist him and to join in the Blue Moon celebrations with Verne, the local Ulfric and his pack..<br /><br />Freeing Richard proves easier than tangling with Colin and crew, plus the corrupt local police, and an assortment of other heinous monsters - there's pure evil on the loose in these hills!! There are some interesting twists in character development in \\"Blue Moon.\\" Anita is more vulnerable here than previously. She has to confront her mixed feelings for both Richard and Jean-Claude, come to terms with Raina's munin - the vengeful spirit who possesses her from time-to-time, make a decision about her reluctant status as leoparde-lionee of the Saint Louis wereleopards, and face her own ignorance in terms of the power she possesses. Anita fears that she is rapidly becoming as much a monster as those she hunts...and loves. Hamilton succeeds beautifully in developing this vulnerable side of Anita, without sacrificing the plot. However, at this point in the series a change was needed. There had to be more to Anita than one tough cookie who goes up against the monsters and wins, repeatedly. This isone of Laurell Hamilton's best novels - tightly plotted, well structured, including wonderful dark humor, acerbic wit, and plenty of thrills and chills.<br /><br />Just a word about the sexual content in \\"Blue Moon.\\" I do not find it any more excessive or graphic than what one reads in most popular fiction - bestseller lists included - nor what is shown on afternoon TV. It would not be realistic to write about a healthy, single woman of 24 and exclude sex. Anyway, I loved this book and certainly recommend it!<br /><br />Janay.

Tackle \\"Blue Belle\\" first, if you're interested, for a richer, more comprehensive read.<br /><br />Burke, is in a deep funk after losing his woman. Before Belle died, she asked Burke to pay her debts. He does what she would have wanted. But he is still cold, empty, locked in an inner jail he can't walk out of. \\"Once I could always find something on the sweet side of the edge I lived on. It was gone. Even in prison, there were some things you could laugh at. That was then.\\" Vachss continues to reveal more of Burke's character, his grim inner world and his past in \\"Hard Candy.\\" He is one of the most complex protagonists I have encountered in popular fiction - edgy, dark, an outcast, as hard-boiled as they come, a scam artist who is a standup guy, a righteous man, and above all, a survivor. Burke, the man, and the strange folks who people his world and call him\\" friend,\\" are what make me a faithful fan and keep me hooked on the series.<br /><br />Word is out on the street that Burke, a sting artist, is now a gun for hire. There is heavy fallout from the rumor. The police hassle him and old friends, the kind he never wanted to see again, come out of the woodwork looking for him. First, Candy, an old flame from his reform school days, gives him a call - after all these years. \\"Little Candy. A whore in her heart, even then. Just what I needed to cheer me up.\\" Candy is still a working girl - we should all be so successful - with mega-upscale digs and a fortune invested in her face and body - silicon implants, face lift, collagen injections, electrolysis, colored contact lenses, a wig in every color, a department store's worth of clothes, make-up, furs - more Neiman Marcus than Macy's. Can she be funding herself? What's her scam? Her teenage daughter, Elvira, dropped out of school and is with a so-called cult in Brooklyn. Candy wants Burke to bring her girl home. He agrees to check things out. In Brooklyn he meets the charismatic, soft-spoken Train, who maintains a safe-house for kids. Elvira is a member of his tribe. But is Train the real deal? Are the teens safer with him than on the streets? Burke has his own suspicions.<br /><br />His involvement with Train reunites him with another acquaintance from his adolescence - Wesley, a killing machine, a robot with a resume of death to show for his life. Burke always wanted to be just like him, totally cold, emotional as ice. Wes warns Burke off his turf - he stepped over the line once, without knowing it, when he killed Mortay in \\"Blue Belle.\\" Now Burke's life is on the line if he messes with Wesley's work again. Just to make things interesting, the Mafia is also on his case. And Strega, the witch he wanted to forget, contacts him with a request.<br /><br />The usual suspects are all present, including: Max the Silent, a Mongolian warrior who calls Burke brother; Pansy is a warrior of another species - she's a Neapolitan mastiff and Burke's roommate; the Mole, a pasty-faced genius who lives in a bunker beneath a high-tech junkyard; the Prophet, a scam artist who speaks in rhyme; Mama Wong, group doyenne - a Chinese Jewish mother and restaurateur. She cares for the gang, takes Burke's messages, holds his stash and feeds him hot and sour soup; Michelle, a gorgeous transvestite who is about ready to go to Denmark for a life-changing operation; and the now famous souped-up Plymouth. \\"The Mole makes sure to change the car's color after it is used on a job.\\"<br /><br />As always Vachss narrative hits hard. His street tough dialogue and staccato-like prose lend authenticity to this raw, darker than noir world - a world where unspeakable horrors are perpetrated upon innocent children. The author, a leader in the child protective movement, calls it \\"a war,\\" and considers his writing as powerful a weapon as his litigation. He openly admits that he writes about the abuse of children because he wants toraise people's awareness of what's going on, and he'll reach a wider audience with fiction.<br /><br />This is a powerful novel - part of a superb series.

All three book are excellent, but Burke, the man, and the strange folks who people his world and call him\\" friend\\" are what keeps me a faithful fan. They are my focus, whatever the plot. And the plots are good, fast-paced and riveting. However, this far-out group of characters has me hooked on the series. Burke is as complex a figure as they come, and he grows, evolves and changes with each book. I have never encountered anyone quite like him before in fiction. He is a hard-boiled, in-your-face, ex-con detective, who still isn't sure on which side of the law he prefers to operate. A survivor, at all cost, he is also a stand-up guy. Vachss delves more into Burke's past here, reveals more about his various prison stints and what he learned there. Fascinating stuff. If you are a Vachss/Burke fan, or become one, I would suggest that you try to read the books in order - at least the first 3 or 4. Of course, every novel stands on its own, independent of the others, but the character's development is continual. There are also references to past events, and for a richer reading experience it is helpful to know the history. If you're just looking for a good read, and not interested in becoming a Burke maven, then by all means, read at random.<br /><br />\\"Blue Belle\\" is one hard-hitting novel, reminiscent of crime fiction in the 1940s and 50s, though much more disturbing. Burke, as always, is our narrator. Everything and everyone comes under his cynical, seen-it-all scrutiny. I have never learned more about the underworld and the seamier side of life, the one most people rarely observe, than through the author's narrative. Burke's expert eyes take in details of life on the street that mine never would. His gritty urban world is one where \\"citizens\\" dwell side-by-side with \\"maggots.\\"<br /><br />A \\"ghost van\\" is terrorizing New York City's prostitutes. A gang of fiends, traveling in a big, smoke-colored van, are brutally murdering teen streetwalkers, young girls, only thirteen and fourteen years-old. A group of pimps put together a war chest and hire Burke to take the van off the streets. Pimps are, after all, businessmen, and lost merchandise and declining profits are bad for business. When the Prophet, a friend, mentor and \\"colleague\\" of Burke's, \\"scopes the scene\\" for information concerning these killers, he encounters a psychopathic martial arts freak by the name of Mortay, (\\"muerte\\"). As a result, the Prof winds up in St. Vincent's Hospital with two broken legs, in a world of hurt. Mortay has been hitting the city's dojo's and challenging each sensei to a death match. He will not allow anyone to walk away, and has killed everyone he has forced to fight him. He gave the Prof a message. He wants to fight Max The Silent, a mute, 20th century Mongolian warrior who calls Burke \\"brother.\\" Max and his woman have just had a baby daughter, whose life Mortay threatens if Max refuses to accept the challenge. Burke senses a connection between the van and Mortay. He just has to find out what it is and how to eliminate both problems....while protecting his brother's family. Grim.<br /><br />New developments occur in this novel which will have a long term effect on our protagonist. Burke has a lifetime history of living a loner's existence. Belle, \\"a big sweet-smelling girl with a snake tattoo on her thigh\\" meets our man to set up an initial appointment with Marques, the pimp. Burke and Belle act on a mutual attraction, which then begins to grow into a relationship. She is a voluptuous exotic dancer, a superb getaway-car driver, and she loves our man. Her past is dark. So what else is new?<br /><br />The usual suspects are all present, including: Max the Silent, now a father, who \\"makes his living as a courier, moving things around the city for a price. His collateral is his life;\\" Pansy is a warrior of another species - she's a Neapolitan mastiff, just like the kind that came over the Alps with Hannibal; the Mole, a pasty-faced genius who lives in a bunker beneath a high-tech junkyard; the Prophet, a scam artist who speaks in rhyme; Mama Wong, group doyenne - a Chinese Jewish mother and restaurateur, \\"keeps her prices high and the ambiance foul to discourage yuppies.\\" She cares for the gang, takes Burke's messages and holds his stash; Michelle, a gorgeous transvestite who is about ready to go to Denmark for a life-changing operation; I should add here that our hero drives a souped-up Plymouth, another important character.

That's the fresh coat of primer it almost always sports - \\"the Mole makes sure to change the car's color after it is used on a job.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Vachss' writing is bleak, gritty, disquieting.

Alternate history, is the exercise of looking at the past and asking \\"what if?\\" What if some major historical event had gone differently? How might the world have been changed? Ultimately, alternate history is the road not taken. Philip Roth's novel, \\"The Plot Against America,\\" is based on the premise that in the 1940 US presidential election, last minute Republican candidate Charles Lindbergh defeats Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Imagine!! Roth, the author, has imagined, and his result is both brilliant and mind boggling - an extraordinary, bone chilling story, beautifully written!! This is, at least partially, an autobiographical novel. The subject is fear - fear and anxiety so sharp the reader can smell it, almost taste it - a boy's fear, and that of the Roth family's of Newark, NJ, their neighbors' and community's. It is also a love story. I have rarely read fiction where the writer pours so much love onto the page - especially for his parents and brother. Herman Roth, Philip's father, is the book's hero, and Bess, his mother shines as the ultimate Jewish heroine - \\"whose worth is far above rubies.\\"<br /><br />\\"Fear presides over these memories, a perpetual fear. Of course, no childhood is without its terrors, yet I wonder if I would have been a less frightened boy if Lindbergh hadn't been president or if I hadn't been the offspring of Jews.\\" Thus the book begins, in the words of the now adult Philip, reminiscing about himself as a seven year-old boy. Our narrator for this tale, however, is young Philip, and a very effective guide he is. His voice is authentic and honest and lends much reality to this alternate fiction. It is not very difficult to remember one's childhood fears, and other emotions. But we examine these feelings in retrospect, colored by the years we have lived since that time. The true genius of this narrative lies in the immediacy with which Roth expresses these long-ago feelings. It is as if he has regressed and tapped into the true emotions of his boyhood self.<br /><br />The Great Depression devastated the American economy in the 1930s. It also gave birth to extreme political movements. Fascism never really caught on in the US, but it did have a following, and anti-Semitism was rampant. Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh were influential voices to the far right, and were extreme isolationists in their views on the European war, better known as the German invasion of Europe. Both received and accepted medals from the Third Reich. In this 1940 election, the one that never happened, Roosevelt runs a campaign based on complex policies, foreign and domestic. Lindbergh, a national hero, handsome and athletic, flies around the USA in his Spirit of St. Louis, promising to keep America out of Europe's war. He greets cheering crowds with the words, \\"Your choice is simple. It's between Lindbergh and war. To preserve the nation, we must resist the propaganda of 'the Jewish race,' and their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio, and our government.\\" In a momentous victory, Lindbergh becomes the 33rd President of the United States, with isolationist Montana Senator Burton K. Wheeler as his vice president, and Henry Ford as Secretary of the Interior.<br /><br />To the Roths, who are second and third generation Americans, this country has always provided a set of constitutional protections which allow them to live, as Jews, in Jewish neighborhoods or anywhere else, should they so wish, without the fear of the violence so prevalent in Europe. They had been relieved from the burden of obvious prejudice when their parents immigrated to the US, never more to be looked upon as outsiders. Herman and Bess Roth are startled by Lindbergh's victory. Herman comments when hearing the jubilant, cheering crowd, \\"They live in a dream, and we live in a nightmare.\\"<br /><br />The characters throughout the novel are lifelike, superbly constructed and three-dimensional - but then I have a feeling that such consistently powerful figures must be largely autobiographical. And the historical figures are absolutely believable. As a matter of fact, Roth has placed a detailed reference at the back of the book, \\"A True Chronology of the Major Figures,\\" from Roosevelt, Lindbergh, Walter Winchell, (who becomes a presidential candidate), and Henry Ford to Joseph Goebbels and Joachim von Ribbentrop, (who is given a state dinner at the White House). Additional documentation is included in this reference also.<br /><br />Mr. Roth succeeds with his vision of an alternate pre-WW II history. This is an extremely difficult genre in which to write a believable narrative. Historical accuracy is necessary, in terms of what has occurred before the author's point of divergence. The historical projection must make complete sense. The devil is in the details - and the details are where the real difficulty lies. The writer has to be part economist, sociologist, historian, military strategist, political scientist, etc.. Most readers are certainly capable of suspending belief, but asking them to stretch their imagination too far is a formula for disaster. Roth's novel is a coherent blend of autobiography, history, and speculation which makes sense of fiction.<br /><br />The plot is fascinating, fast paced and riveting. The writing is fluid. The author's vivid descriptions bring sights, smells, entire neighborhoods and events to life, and make a variety of intense feelings palpable. I could not put this book down. The use of irony and dark humor are fantastic. I don't remember whether I laughed more than I cried. I believe that Philip Roth confronts the possibility of an anti-Semitic, fascist America from an American point of view, rather than from a Jewish perspective. For Herman Roth, Jewishness is, \\"neither a mishap or a misfortune or an achievement to be 'proud' of.\\" It is rather \\"in the nature of things, as fundamental as having arteries and veins.\\" He insists on a place in this country, his country, as an American, no matter what \\"the nature of things\\" might be. This is what Herman Roth believes and this is what makes \\"The Plot Against America\\" an American novel. My highest recommendation!<br /><br />JANAg that such consistently powerful figures must be largely autobiographical. And the historical figures are absolutely believable.

363655:US	51247650	R2BQXBDCJME3WJ	0679781293	222744857	Flood	Books	5	25	26	N	Y	"FLOOD" - A Novel Of Revenge - OUTSTANDING!!!	\\"Flood\\" is Andrew Vachss' first novel featuring Burke, the hard-boiled, in-your-face, ex-con detective, who still isn't sure on which side of the law he prefers to operate. Abandoned at birth, father and mother unknown, Burke has no real first name. \\"Baby boy\\" is the name on his birth certificate. He is a survivor. He's also a stand-up guy. The novel is set in 1980s NYC, before Mayor Guiliani came to office and cleaned up the mean streets - or tried to. I have read a few other Burke books and became so fascinated with this complex character, and with the strange folks who people his world and call him\\" friend,\\" that I wanted to read this first book in the series to get a better sense of how he was developed. If you are a Vachss/Burke fan, or become one, I would suggest that you try to read the books in order. Of course, every novel stands on its own, independent of the others, but the growth and development of the characters are continual. There are also references to past events, and for a richer reading experience it is helpful to know the history. If you're just looking for a good read, and not interested in becoming a Burke maven, then by all means, read at random.<br /><br />\\"Flood\\" is one hard-hitting novel, reminiscent of crime fiction in the 1940s and 50s, though much more disturbing. Burke is our narrator. And the narrative, at times, goes off on a tangent, like his thought processes. Our protagonist is a meticulous man. He always returns to make his point. I think this occasional stream of consciousness is very effective and enhances Burke's persona. Vachss still manages to maintain a tight writing style throughout. Everything and everyone comes under Burke's cynical, seen-it-all scrutiny. I have never learned more about the underworld and the seamier side of life, the one most people rarely observe, than in this compelling tale. Burke's expert eyes take in details of life on the street that mine never would. His gritty urban world is one where \\"citizens\\" dwell side-by-side with \\"maggots.\\"<br /><br />Flood, a young woman with an attitude and a black belt in karate, hires Burke to track down a freak, Martin Howard Wilson, a.k.a. The Cobra. He is a vicious pedophile, at the very least, and responsible for killing her best friend's child. She has sword a blood oath to kill this degenerate, but she has to find him first. That's where our man comes into the picture. Flood will become an extremely important person in Burke's life and her presence in this novel is a powerful one.<br /><br />Vachss populates Burke's world with a colorful assortment of characters, and I am just crazy about all of them. Max the Silent, a mute, 20th century Mongolian warrior with creative ways of communicating; Pansy, another warrior of another species - she's a Neapolitan mastiff, just like the kind that came over the Alps with Hannibal; the Mole, a pasty-faced genius who lives in a bunker beneath a high-tech junkyard; the Prophet, a scam artist who speaks in rhyme; Mama Wong, group doyenne - a Chinese Jewish mother and restaurateur, \\"keeps her prices high and the ambiance foul to discourage yuppies.\\" She cares for the gang and holds Burke's stash; Michelle, a gorgeous transvestite who needs to \\"break out;\\" Mouse who continues to exploit his one successful scam \\"despite a lengthy sojourn in the federal joint;\\" Maurice the bookie, who Burke speaks to almost daily, due to his appreciation for all things equestrian; I should add here that our hero drives a souped-up Plymouth, another important character. It usually looks like it's been painted with rust. That's the fresh coat of primer it almost always sports - \\"the Mole makes sure to change the car's color after it is used on a job.\\"<br /><br />In \\"Flood,\\" published in 1985, Andrew Vachss began to publicly address the plight of kidnapped and abused children - way before the era of Amber Alerts and photographs of missing kids on milk cartons. Mr. Vachss is a lawyer, who specialized in prosecutingchild abuse cases. He has worked as a federal investigator in sexually transmitted diseases, a caseworker in New York, and managed a maximum-security prison for violent juvenile offenders. He was also deeply involved in the relief effort in Biafra, now Nigeria. Vachss calls the child protective movement \\"a war,\\" and considers his writing as powerful a weapon as his litigation. He openly admits that he writes about the abuse of children because he wants to raise people's awareness of what's going on, and he'll reach a wider audience with fiction.<br /><br />\\"Flood\\" has some of the toughest prose and most intriguing characters around - an absolutely riveting read!!<br />JANAworked as a federal investigator in sexually transmitted diseases, a caseworker in New York, and managed a maximum-security prison for violent juvenile offenders.

Anita Blake, Executioner, necromancer, human servant to a Master Vampire, lupa, acting-Alpha of a pack of werewolves, and leoparde-lionee to a pard of leopard lycanthropes, is changing...more so all the time. When Laurell Hamilton introduced her to us in \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" Book One of the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series, Anita was a 24 year-old dynamo - smart, attractive, feisty, super-independent - who raised the dead for a living. She was almost a normal 21st century career girl. Of course she staked rogue vampires as a sideline, but we all have our quirks. Anita's preternatural powers have been steadily increasing, and in \\"Burnt Offerings\\" the lines are really beginning to blur between her humanity and the supernatural. Always an uncompromising and tough lady, she's is developing a hardness, a detachment, that frightens even herself. In this novel she is ready to kill a werewolf who had betrayed the pack, even though murder is not necessary to punish the shapeshifter. She is indifferent about whether or not to pull the trigger. Killing means nothing to her, she realizes. Anita thinks, \\"I didn't want to kill anyone that coldly. Killing doesn't bother me, but it should mean something.\\" Sergeant Rudolph Storr, the detective in charge of the Regional Preternatural Investigation Team, which Anita is a member of, tells her, \\"You just spend too much time with the damn monsters, Anita. You've played by their rules for so long, sometimes you forget what it's like to be normal.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Hamilton's plots are extraordinary, but the reason I am so addicted to the Anita Blake books is because of the characters. Anita is not the only one who has developed in a major three-dimensional way through seven novels. The other main characters: Vampire Master Jean-Claude; Werewolf Ulfric, Richard Zeeman; Larry Kirkland, vampire executioner trainee; Ronnie, Anita's best friend, and several minor personages have also grown, as have their relationships with Ms. Blake and each other. As exciting as the storylines are, I am constantly drawn back to the folks who people these novels. And the characters are what makes the series so unique and special.<br /><br />\\"Burnt Offerings\\" has Sergeant Storr asking Anita for assistance with an outbreak of serious fires throughout St. Louis. Both Storr and Anita think the culprit may be a \\"firebug,\\" a being who uses supernatural power to cause conflagrations. In the previous book, Anita, Richard, (her old boyfriend), and Jean-Claude, (her present lover), had formed a Triumvirate of power. In other words, when the three connect, they exude tremendous force and are able to do much more magic than any one or two can do alone. The three are still bound to each other, even though Richard is furious with Anita for dumping him, and jealous of Jean-Claude for obvious reasons.<br /><br />Their Triumvirate has attracted the attention of the Vampire Council. This body of old and magically powerful vampires decide policy, and will condemn those who question their authority to a terrible undeath. They travel to St. Louis to investigate Jean-Claude, Richard and Anita, whom they view as a threat to their power. Some of these ancient beings have hidden agendas which make it almost impossible for our gang of three to survive the trials and tribulations before them. Anita is put in a position where she is forced to rescue not only friends, but enemies as well.<br /><br />Ms. Blake's narrative is written with much flair and pizzazz, mixing fantasy with mystery, romance and dark humor. Her take on this derivative genre is a most unusual one. As I mentioned before, the characters and their relationships take precedence over the plot - which certainly doesn't suffer. The novel is chock-full of action, suspense and adventure, of the intelligent sort. Big pluses: introduced here are the Traveler, a Master Vampire who does not inhabit a body of his own, but moves from vampire to vampire, and Asher, someone from Jean Claude's past. The humor, dark as always, adds much to the novel....and there are plenty of laughs to counteract the violence. Overall, I cannot recommend this series enough. \\"Burnt Offerings\\" is the most complex novel yet.<br /><br />JANAlaude's past.

Seductive? Does she wound with her eyes? Is she a femme fatale, \\"aware of her power, or utterly innocent of it?\\" Otto Penzler, editor, bookseller, and founder of Mysterious Press, asks this question in his Introduction to this short fiction anthology, \\"Dangerous Women.\\" The answer is subjective - a matter of opinion. Seventeen outstanding authors, some of the best writers in the mystery/suspense genre, answer the question here, creatively, diabolically, deliciously. Lying, manipulation, seduction, horror, murder, secretiveness, suicide - they're all covered in these stories. \\"Dangerous Women\\" is an outstanding, wicked, absolutely amazing collection. Consistent excellence is what makes this book so special and sets it apart from the rest. Ed McBain, Michael Connelly, Joyce Carol Oates, Anne Perry, Elmore Leonard, Walter Mosley, Laura Lippman, Nelson DeMille, Thomas Cook, Andrew Klaven, John Connolly, Lorenzo Carcaterra, J. A.  Jance, Jay McInerey, S. J.

Michael Connelly's Detective Harry Bosch, says, in \\"Cielo Azul,\\" that his LAPD partner always believed \\"the most dangerous women are beautiful in life, heartbreaking in death.\\" \\"A black and silver diamond-headed spider, the so-called 'happy spider,' \\" who spins her web with venom, is Joyce Carol Oates' kind of woman in \\"Give Me Your Heart.\\" Talk about a woman scorned! Walter Mosley's \\"Karma\\" loved somebody so much she'd die for him. \\"Rendezvous,\\" Nelson DeMille's first short story in twenty-five years, takes you into a sweltering Vietnamese jungle where the most lethal enemy is not a man at all. Ian Rankin writes about a prison warden fascinated by the steamy prison mail he censors in \\"Soft Spot.\\" Jeffrey Deaver's \\"Born Bad\\" is chilling! Every one of these stories is a gem, along with those I have not mentioned.<br /><br />This is the perfect book to take on a trip....or on the train to work...or for reading during lunch hour. You can read a short story as satisfying as any novel, and put the book down without feeling that you have left at a crucial moment in the narrative.

I just hate to do that - especially when the book has been recommended to me by a friend. I did complete Tanya Huff's \\"Summon The Keeper,\\" although I was tempted to put it down for good at various points in the narrative. What a silly book! Seriously! Ms. Huff's premise is fascinating. When I read reviews describing the plot, I couldn't wait to pick up the novel. And when I did, I found the characters to be one-dimensional straight-men for the heroine, or for her talking cat. And the jokes and quips are so juvenile. I think what was meant to be satire turned into slapstick on the way to the printer. The plot plods, it rambles. Jokes become more important than the storyline. The voice of Hell, who lives way below the basement, even thinks he's a comedian. Now that sounds funny when I write it - but when Hell keeps shouting-out non sequiturs, it gets old soon! As a result, the dark nature of the storyline lacks impact. Hell seems more hilarious than torturous. And the preternatural turns into bad sitcom.<br /><br />Claire Hansen is a Keeper. She belongs to a race of humans, descended from Adam and Lilith, which have magical powers. Her primary duty is to patch up the fabric of the universe when it has been torn, to prevent evil from leaking through to our world. Magic is not allowed to become mayhem when a Keeper is on the job. She and her cat, Austin, have been summoned to a guesthouse, the Elysian Fields, in Eastern Canada. The present landlord abandons the B&B on Claire's and Austin's first night. The two awaken to find that Claire is the new proprietor - her signature on the hotel register was used on the transfer of ownership documents. She has also inherited: the inn's wholesome, handsome handyman, Dean from Newfoundland; a flirtatious French-Canadian ghost, Jacques; an infestation of imps; a hole in the basement floor which is really the portal to Hell - although it does heat the house; and an evil female Keeper, asleep for 50 years now, in room number 6. Claire has to make sure the lady remains asleep while guarding the entrance to Hell. All she has to do is figure out how to close the basement rift and get rid of Sleeping Beauty. Claire's mother and sister come to visit, as do aging Greek gods, a musical vampire, and two werewolves. This all sounds delightful. Right? That's why I bought the book. All these wonderful characters have frequent inane conversations - trite dialogue which leads nowhere. Some of the humor is good, really good! There is just too much of it. I only wanted the tale to be told, without so many unnecessary interruptions. I wanted to be absorbed.<br /><br />For clarification, I want to note that I am a major fan of the Anita Blake series, Sookie Stackhouse, and the Dresden Files.

Author Jim Butcher introduces his now famous wizard, Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden, in \\"Storm Front.\\" Harry lives in a universe where magic and science coexist - it's our universe also - Chicago, USA, to be exact. The sign on his door, which advertises his consulting business reads: \\"Harry Dresden - Wizard: Lost Items Found. Paranormal Investigations. Consulting. Advice. Reasonable Rates. No Love Potions, Endless Purses, Parties, or Other Entertainment.\\" Dresden is also listed in the yellow pages - under wizards, of course. Vampires, demons,  faerie's, werewolves, knights (the kind in shining armor with magical swords), and other preternatural critters exist in Harry's, and our world - even outside of Chicago.  The Nevernever is a spirit realm which these beings call home, but they can and do hang-out in the human world.<br /><br />Lieutenant Karrin Murphy is the Director of Special Investigations at the Chicago Police Department. The unit exists precisely because the supernatural folks listed above exist - and many of them commit crimes against humanity. Dresden is a paid consultant to this unit. In the novel's first pages Murphy informs Harry that a pair of corpses have been discovered in a hotel suite at the Madison, in a most compromising position. The crime scene is unusually gruesome. It appears that an extremely powerful supernatural force has been used to kill the couple. He is told to get to the scene ASAP! Just before Lt. Murphy's call, a distraught wife phoned. Her husband has gone missing under mysterious circumstances and Harry makes an appointment with her at her insistence. He usually searches for lost articles - not husbands.<br /><br />More murders are committed - same MO. Harry becomes a suspect. To make matters worse, the White Council, a governing group of Wizards which monitors to prevent the use of dark magic, is on Harry's back. He has been placed under the \\"Doom of Damocles,\\" a sort of wizard probation which could turn into a lethal sentence. Then murderous mobsters, magic most dark and heinous demons join in to make life deadlier.<br /><br />\\"Storm Front\\" is a fine beginning to a series which has become a mainstay for fantasy/sci-fi fans. This is an action packed mystery, filled with a range of funny and scary characters: Mister (Harry's huge gray cat); Toot, a ditzy faery with faulty memory; Bob, an air spirit living in a skull in Harry's basement, who acts as Dresden's encyclopedia of magic lore, (the wizard cannot use the Internet as anything electrical malfunctions when he is close by); Susan Rodriguez, a very sexy reporter for the Chicago Arcane, who has the hots for Harry; the evil omnipresent Shadowman; and Lt. Murphy (Harry's Chicago PD friend and boss). Harry is an unusual character. He has a slapstick sense of humor that leads one to think he is less powerful than he actually is - and less serious. He is honest, has a deep-rooted code of honor, and a dark side also. The explanations behind his spells are fascinating, and go into more detail than most books in this genre. I found this a major plus.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, (Laurell Hamilton is the author). Anita's job is a little like Harry's. She does work for a consulting firm, and is also on a special supernatural investigation team, with the local police, which hunts down other-worldly predators. While I really enjoyed \\"Storm Front,\\" I prefer the Blake novels and Anita's character. She is much edgier and her storylines take a darker approach than the Dresden/Jim Butcher novels.' Although the Dresden Files deal with super evil beings, Harry lightens things up a bit. I think it important to note my preference, as it will give the potential reader an idea of where I am coming from with my review and rating.

Sookie Stackhouse, the attractive, telepathic barmaid from Bon Temps, LA, is back in \\"Living Dead In Dallas,\\" Book 2 of Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire series. Sookie's heretofore lonely life as a single is no more. She is in love and the feeling is reciprocated. Folks in her backwater northern Louisiana town always treated her as if she had a disability. They made her feel ashamed of her \\"gift,\\" the ability to read other people's minds. What were they thinking?? The major disadvantages to her telepathy are her inability to keep the voices at bay, even though she has learned to shield herself somewhat. She had also been unable to have a relationship until recently. How can you fall in love when you know everything your boyfriend is thinking? Boyfriend Bill is just what she needed...almost. Tall, dark and very handsome, albeit very pale, Bill Compton is a vampire who lived, and died, during the Civil War. Sookie had always wanted to meet a vampire, since vampirism became legal a few years before the novel begins. I don't think she envisioned herself coming home to one at night though. The two met in Merlotte's Bar, while she was working. She served him bottled synthesized Type O Positive, and it was love at first sight. (Did you think I'd actually write, 'love at 1st bite?'). There is another important element in the couple's relationship  - one which definitely makes for success. Sookie cannot hear Bill's thoughts, which he thoughtfully blocks from her. Peace and quiet at last!<br /><br />Bill is doing his best to assimilate into the general human population. He dines on bottled blood rather than hunt, and is making human friends in Bon Temps, especially among the town's Descendants of the Glorious Dead Society. After all, he is a war vet. He even involves himself with the local vampire self-governing body in Shreveport, to gain their protection for Sookie and himself. Bill has been made Vampire Investigator of Area 5 - their general neighborhood. In the politically complex vampire society, Sookie, as Bill's girlfriend, is now obligated to utilize her telepathic powers for Area 5 Nest's purposes.<br /><br />One early morning, while she is on day shift, Sookie finds a dead friend's body in a cop car outside of Merlotte's. A few evenings later, on the way to Shreveport with Bill, she is attacked and almost killed by a murderous Maenad accompanied by a feral razorback. Bill rushes her to the Fangtasia, a vampire bar, owned by Eric, Master Vampire and kingpin of the local power structure. Sookie has been poisoned by the Maenad and is dying. The only way to save her is to drain her blood and replace it with a human-blood transfusion. Eric and his gang happily suck out the bad blood and inject the new. Eric then expects Sookie and Bill to do a job for him, quid pro quo. It seems that the vampires of Area 6, (Dallas), have a problem they are unable to resolve on their own. One of their number has gone missing, and the Dallas leader thinks a fanatic cult, a quasi-religious group of vampire haters, The Fellowship of the Sun Center, might have kidnapped him. Eric wants to loan Sookie to the Dallas vampires as a consultant. They could use her telepathic gifts about now. Sookie does not relish the idea, and refuses to travel without Bill. So it's plane tickets to Dallas for two - Sookie's first flight, and a suite at the luxurious Silent Shore Hotel, which caters to the undead - coffin space in the cellar and everything!<br /><br />The story turns into a roller-coaster ride of an adventure from this point, with one surprise after another and much action of the preternatural sort. Sookie is almost kidnapped from the moment she steps off the plane - and that is only the beginning. She also discovers and interacts with supernatural beings she had thought only mythical...and some of these critters are downright nasty.<br /><br />\\"Living Dead In Dallas\\" is plotted like a mystery novel, in spite of the other-worldly elements. There's a corpse. Then there's a missing undead person. Lots of investigation takes place, along with too many mishaps and adventures to count. And finally, almost all is pulled together and resolved. Sookie's development as a person takes center stage in the storyline, along with the development of her relationship with Bill. And it looks like sexy Master Eric is going to play a greater role in future novels. Yummy!<br /><br />Author Charlaine Harris's writing is excellent, as is her sense of humor. There are few unnecessary elements or ploys here. The characters are wonderful and well developed. Sookie Stockhouse is a real sweetie, though somewhat naive. She is a smalltown gal, after all. However, she is growing fast and I look forward to watching her develop. Her adventures are dark, but her self-deprecating manner helps to lighten things up. Unlike some, I preferred \\"Dead Until Dark,\\" Book One to this one. The writing seemed tighter and the pace was more consistent. This is not as much of a page-turner. Don't get me wrong though. It is just the difference between a 4 and 5 stars rating. I enjoyed the novel - and if you like Sookie, you will also.<br /><br />JANAThere's a corpse. Then there's a missing undead person.

Filled with mystery, surprises, suspense, wonderful characters and imaginative detail, the Harry Potter books, created by J. K. Rowling, make for excellent reading. \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is no exception and is one of my very favorites in this addictive series.<br /><br />From the very beginning of the book I was enchanted. Summer vacation is almost over and Harry can't wait for school to start, nor can he wait to get away from his miserable relatives, Muggles Aunt and Uncle Dursley and their spoiled rotten, pig-like son, Dudley. Harry has suffered enough of their insults and longs to go back to The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his real home. His parents were killed by the evil Voldemort, and the Dursleys, his only living family, took him in to raise. On Harry's birthday, right before school begins, his uncle banishes him to his bedroom while the family entertains visitors. Dobby, a house elf sneaks up to Harry's room to warn him not to return to Hogwarts. Danger awaits! From the moment of Dobby's warning, the mystery begins.<br /><br />And terrible danger arises very soon after Harry and Ron make their entrance at Hogwarts, reunite with Hermione, and other old friends, and meet-up with Draco Malfoy, Harry's malicious arch rival. Malfoy is after Harry again, Big Time! Of course the beloved giant Hagrid is at school to welcome the students, along with Professor Dumbledore, who is at his best, quoting such wisdom as, \\"It is not abilities that show us who we really are, it is our choices.\\" Professors Snape, McGonagall, and herbology teacher Sprout are all back this year. They are joined by new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a narcissistic charlatan, who is very ineffective in his specialty, Defense Against the Dark Arts. And all look forward to the first Quidditch game of the season, which proves to be extremely dangerous!<br /><br />The horror begins when Harry starts hearing sibilant voices, that are not heard by anyone else, and ominous words appear on the walls, written in blood - \\"The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware.\\" Mysterious events begin to reoccur, each one creepier than the next. The school may have to close for the safety of the students. And almost everyone suspects that Harry is involved. There is an intense battle which takes place in the Chamber of Secrets that had me on the edge of my seat. Seriously scary here, so take care when reading aloud to little ones.<br /><br />Ms. Rowling's characters are fabulous, as is her humor! Some of the many funny beings who populate the novel include: medicinal Mandrake plants, used for special potions, whose roots scream when pulled, a Whomping Willow Tree, peculiar pixies, giant spiders, Professor Dumbledore's pet phoenix who occasionally burns and rises from his ashes, Mopy, Moaning Myrtle, a ghost who lives in the bathroom, etc.. Oh yes, there is a magic flying car that Harry and Ron Weasley drive back to school when they miss the train - and what a drive!<br /><br />This book is a pure delight! I highly recommend it to anyone who is a child at heart, and loves adventure, and imaginative writing. I think it is a good idea to read Book 1, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" before this one, but it is not necessary. Enough background information is given here that \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" can be read alone. Bravo, J.K. Rowling !

Eleanor Bly is the narrator of \\"Five Mile House\\" and our tour guide through the macabre. A 19th century gentlewoman, she was the wife of Joshua Bly, mother to eight children, and perhaps the most knowledgeable about the chilling history of the house, and of certain bizarre occurrences which took place in the late 1890s in the small lakeside town of Wellington, New England. The house is still located there, on Five Mile Hill, a landmark site. Eleanor has been dead now for a very long time. She has been waiting, alone, for someone to tell her story to. As a suicide, her soul is not at rest. She is bound to the earth until the truth about the nature of her death is brought to light. And so she describes to the reader, her only audience, the events and subsequent scandals which brought down her family...and herself. She waits in the tower, the highest room in the house, the one which had been hers. She awaits the convergence of past and future, and perhaps, for her salvation.<br /><br />In a busy New England city, far from Wellington and Five Mile House, Leslie Stone, her husband Greg, and their two adorable daughters, 4 year-old Emma, and Molly, age 10, get ready for another day at work, and, since it is the dog days of summer, daycare. Leslie is a police detective - a darn good one. Because of budget cutbacks, she had been assigned from her position on the Domestic Violence Task Force to the Homicide Division. The new assignment is tearing her apart. Most of the murder victims she has been dealing with have been small children. On this steamy summer morning, Leslie and her partner receive yet another homicide call. The victim is a tiny four-year-old girl, the same age as her daughter Emma. Leslie finds the child's bloodied, broken body. She had been viciously molested. Later that same morning Leslie, who has been on edge and under severe pressure for some time, totally snaps. She takes her gun into the holding cage where the murder suspect waits, and she shoots him dead. Detective Stone is tried, and found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. The judge, concerned for her safety and that of others, has her committed to an appropriate institution until her doctors determine she is no longer a risk.<br /><br />So, former detective Stone, in a severe post trauma depression, is temporarily institutionalized. When she is released from the hospital, her husband, in an effort to change their environment, takes his family to a small New England town to work on a mysterious project, the restoration of Five Mile House. Greg is a building contractor and has been hired under strange circumstances. He is extremely under qualified for this visible and high paying job. It doesn't take long for the Stones to hear about Eleanor Bly, a 19th century madwoman who murdered her seven children in Five Mile House and then killed herself. Leslie becomes obsessed with Eleanor's story, suspecting that the truth may be different from the accepted myth.<br /><br />Wellington, locally known for its coven of Wiccan followers, has many secrets of its own. It is here in Wellington, with Five Mile House as a backdrop, that an intense and disturbing drama plays out, involving those working on the restoration project, their families, and many town citizens.<br /><br />The stories of both Eleanor and Leslie are told in parallel narratives until they come together at the very end. As frightening as it is suspenseful, \\"Five Mile House\\" is as much a mystery as a ghost story. Karen Novak's prose is beautiful. Her lyrical, descriptive narrative and her seemingly innate storytelling ability, make this novel a compelling read. Her characters draw the reader in - they are rivetingly real. I find it difficult to believe this is a first novel. At the conclusion I was literally left breathless. How much more haunted can a house be??? Highly recommended!<br /><br />JANAdead.

Abandoned at birth, father and mother unknown, Burke has no real first name. \\"Baby boy\\" is the name on his birth certificate. The novel is set 1980s NYC, before Mayor Guiliani came to office and cleaned up the mean streets - or tried to. \\"Strega\\" is also the first Andrew Vachss book I have read. I must say, I am very impressed by his writing style and storyline. Most of the Burke series deals with hunting down and prosecuting child molesters, as does this novel. Mr. Vachss has selected a noble cause, and deals professionally and knowledgeably with the topic. The author is a lawyer, specializing in prosecuting child abuse cases, so he certainly has the expertise to be an advocate. He openly admits that he writes about the abuse of children because he wants to raise people's awareness of what's going on, and he'll reach a wider audience with fiction.<br /><br />P. I. Burke is the narrator. And the narrative, at times, goes off on a tangent, like Burke's thought processes. The PI is a careful guy. He always returns to make his point. I think this occasional stream of consciousness is extremely effective and enhances the detective's persona. Vachss still manages to maintain a tight writing style throughout. Everything and everyone comes under Burke's cynical, seen-it-all scrutiny. I have never learned more about the underworld and life behind bars than in this novel. I find the descriptions of the seamier side of life, the one \\"citizens\\" rarely observe, to be fascinating. Burke's expert eye takes in details of life on the street that I never would. \\"The streets were quiet, but if you look close, you could see things. Two guys standing against the wall of a darkened gas station - the wool caps on their heads would turn into ski masks when they pulled them down, hands in their pockets. A lonely prostitute in a fake-fur coat with a white mini-skirt underneath, looking to turn one last trick before she called it a night. A van with blacked-out windows driving by slowly, watching the woman while the two men in the shadows watched the van. In New York, the vultures work close to the ground.\\"<br /><br />Vachss populates his world with a colorful assortment of characters: Max the Silent, a mute Mongolian version of Conan the Barbarian with creative ways of communicating; Pansy, a vicious Neapolitan mastiff, just like the kind that came over the Alps with Hannibal; the Mole, a pasty-faced genius who lives in a bunker beneath a high-tech junkyard; the Prophet, a scam artist who has done too much time behind walls to care; Mama Wong, group doyenne and Chinese restaurateur, \\"keeps her prices high and the ambience foul to discourage yuppies.\\" She cares for the gang and holds Burke's stash; Michelle, a gorgeous transvestite who needs to \\"break out;\\" and Immaculata , Max's Vietnamese love interest, a child therapist. I should add here that our hero drives a souped-up Plymouth, another important character. It usually looks like it's been painted with rust. That's the fresh coat of primer it almost always sports - \\"the Mole makes sure to change the car's color after it is used on a job.\\"<br /><br />Julio, a big-shot mob figure and acquaintance of Burke's, strong-arms the PI to take a new case. Julio's close family friend, Gina, is an Italian princess with lots of charisma. She is desperate to recover an obscene photograph of a little boy. The child, Scotty, is her six-year old daughter's playmate. Gina calls herself \\"Strega,\\" (\\"a witch-bit*h you could lust after or run from. You could be in the middle of a desert and her shadow would make you cold.\\"), is not above manipulation or anything else that will assist her in getting her way.<br /><br />The search for the Polaroid picture will take Burke and his band of men to the dark side, to a world they never wanted to know, filledwith the anguish and pain of children.<br /><br />Realistic - some of the toughest prose I've read -  amazingly lifelike characters - riveting! What more can I say??<br /><br />JANAo know, filled with the anguish and pain of children. <br />  <br />Realistic - some of the toughest prose I've read -  amazingly lifelike characters - riveting!

383107:US	51247650	RR4KU16KRD04D	1400041341	205915316	Living to Tell the Tale	Books	5	63	65	N	N	An Extraordinary Memoir - Myth & History, Magic & Fact!	\\"Living to Tell the Tale,\\" (\\"Vivir Para Contarla\\"), is the first book in a planned trilogy that will make up the memoirs of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the renown Colombian writer who initially won public acclaim in the mid-1960s for his novel \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\\" At that time, Garcia Marquez, a journalist and writer, had never sold more than 700 copies of a book. While driving his family through Mexico, he had a veritable brainstorm. He remembered his grandmother's storytelling technique - to recall fantastic, improbable events as if they had actually happened - literally. That was the key to recounting the life of the imaginary village of Macondo and her inhabitants. He turned the car around and drove back home to begin \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" anew. To my mind it is one of the 20th century's best works of fiction, and was highlighted in the citation awarding Garcia Marquez the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature.<br /><br />\\"Living to Tell The Tale\\" relates the early years of the author's life, although some of the book's most important incidents predate Garcia Marquez's birth. The impact of these experiences, the people and their stories, were to have a powerful effect on him, as a man and as a writer. This is the tale of his parents' courtship, marriage and the birth of their children, Garcia Marquez, (Gabito), the oldest, and his ten siblings. It tells of his early years which were spent in Aracataca, in the home of his maternal grandparents. His grandfather, Colonel Nicol&aacute;s Ricardo M&aacute;rquez Mej&iacute;a, was a Liberal veteran of the War of a Thousand Days. He was supposedly a storyteller of great repute. The Colonel told his young grandson that there was no greater burden than to have killed a man. Later Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez would put these words into the mouths of his characters. His grandmother, Tranquilina Iguar&aacute;n Cotes, had a major influence on Gabriel's life also. Another great source of stories, her mind was filled with superstitions and folklore, and she gossiped away with her numerous sisters within hearing range of young \\"Gabito.\\" No matter how fantastic her statements, she always delivered them as if they were the absolute, verifiable truth. This was the style which was to effect Garcia Marquez's fiction, sometimes called \\"magical realism.\\" These women filled the house with stories of ghosts, premonitions and omens - all of which were studiously ignored by her husband. He had little interest in \\"women's beliefs.\\"<br /><br />Aracataca was a small village, a banana town on the Caribbean coast, where poverty was the norm and violence was an everyday occurrence. On December 6, 1928, in the Cienaga train station, near Aracataca, 3,000 striking banana workers were shot and killed by troops from Antioquia. Although still a baby, this event, recounted to him, was to have a profound effect on the author. The incident was officially forgotten and omitted from Colombian history textbooks.<br /><br />In 1940, when he was twelve, Gabo was awarded a scholarship to a secondary school for gifted students, run by Jesuits. The school, the Liceo Nacional, was in Zipaquir&aacute;, a city 30 miles to the north of Bogot&aacute;. It was during his school years, 1940s and 50s, that he was first drawn to poetry - a national obsession in Colombia. Verse was revered as an art form, and also as an effective means of social and political commentary. He and his friends, fellow students, would read aloud and discuss poetry late into the night. The youths admired a group of poets called the piedra y cielo (\\"stone and sky\\") and they were strongly influenced by Juan Ramon Jimenez and Pablo Neruda. Too poor to buy his own books, Gabo would devour novels borrowed from friends.<br /><br />While still a boy, he decided he wanted to be a writer. The people who surrounded him in his childhood later became instrumental when developing the characters and the storylines for his novels. \\"Love In The Time of Cholera\\"was inspired by the romance between his mother and father. And his grandfather, who had twelve children, (some say 16), by two different women, became Colonel Aureliano Buendia in \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude.\\"<br /><br />One of the most powerful episodes of the book tells of the period called \\"La Violencia.\\" In 1948 the Liberal presidential candidate, Jorge Eliecer Gaitan, was assassinated. The murder led to rioting, and left approximately 2500 dead on the streets of Bogota, during \\"el Bogot&aacute;zo.\\" Political violence and repression followed. One of the buildings that burned was the pension where Garcia Marquez lived, and his manuscripts were destroyed along with his living quarters. The National University was closed and he was forced to go to the university in Cartagena. Garcia Marquez began his career as a journalist, writing stories and commentary for a Liberal newspaper in Cartegana. Later he moved to the coastal city of Barranquilla where he began to associate with a group of young writers who admired modernists like Joyce, Woolf and Hemingway, and introduced Marquez to Faulkner. In 1954 he returned to Bogota, as a reporter for El Espectador.<br /><br />Garcia Marquez begins his book, however, not with his real birth in 1928, but with his \\"birth as a writer,\\" at age 22. He and his mother took a trip from Baranquilla, where he was working as a reporter, to his childhood home in Aracataca, now virtually a ghost town. They were going to sell the ancestral house. Vivid memories were stirred up here, memories which electrified his imagination. This trip was to change the course of his writing life. \\"With the first step I took onto the burning sands of the town, Aracataca instantly became Macondo, an earthly paradise of desolation and nostalgia.\\" His one great subject became his family, \\"which was never the protagonist of anything, but only a witness to and victim of everything.\\" His is not a chronological autobiography. Garcia Marquez cuts back and forth through time to show how memory colors experience. As he says in the book's epigraph, \\"Life is not what one lived, but what one remembers and how one remembers it in order to recount it.\\"<br /><br />Humor, dry wit, a sense of the absurd, is a trademark throughout the novels of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and this autobiography is full of his deadpan humor. His anecdotes of his many mistresses and cafe society are wonderful. \\"Living To Tell The Tale\\" is not a conventional literary memoir. It is a magical combination of memoir and national history written in the author's remarkable voice. It is his personal mythology, from the repertoire which birthed Macondo. The narrative is intimate and sincere, filled with bewitching details and descriptions. In spite of poverty, and the political turmoil so prevalent in Colombia during his lifetime, Gabo acknowledges his early years were filled with joy, a sense of well-being and encouragement from many people. Garcia Marquez leaves us, at the end of this volume, with a glimpse of his future love, his wife, \\"\\"wearing a green dress with golden lace in that year's style, her hair cut like swallows' wings, and with the intense stillness of someone waiting for a person who will not arrive.\\"<br /><br />Edith Grossman has done a fine translation.

Anita Blake is a feisty, independent, 21st century lady who's got attitude with a capital \\"A.\\" Animator, necromancer, called by vampires everywhere \\"The Executioner, she is tops in her field and a woman of many talents. The St. Louis Police Department's Regional Preternatural Investigation Team has made her a full fledged member, a civilian expert, and she is on call 24/7 to help solve their more grizzly cases. Unfortunately Anita prefers to date the undead and the \\"lunarly disadvantaged.\\" She is involved with Richard Zeeman, rugged, outdoor type, science teacher by day, and otherwise a werewolf. Jean Claude, Master Vampire, sophisticate, unbelievably handsome and sexiest vamp around town, also has a hold on her affections. What's a girl to do?<br /><br />Bert, the greedy, unscrupulous owner of Animators, Inc., and Anita's boss, has already taken money in exchange for Anita's services on a new case; services he doesn't know whether she is able to perform. Millions of dollars are at stake, and Anita may be the only animator powerful enough to do the job. So she leaves St. Louis for the rural town of Branson, Missouri. Her mission is to raise an entire graveyard of zombies in order to settle some land dispute issues. The bones have been disturbed and separated, and the corpses are at least 300 years-old. The older the corpse, the bigger the sacrifice needed for a raising, and the more powerful an animator has to be. Another matter of great concern - someone, or something is killing local youths. An ancient, psychotic, sword-wielding vampire, and his renegade cohorts, are most likely involved in the grotesque multiple murders. Against her better judgement, Anita calls on Jean Claude for help, since she isn't receiving any from the local police. The idea is to go through the area's Master Vampire - Serephina - and petition her to rein in her monsters. The story can only become scarier with Serephina in on the action.<br /><br />And yet another complication arises - a fey family, the Bouviers, is involved in the graveyard-land dispute.

Phineas Poe, an alcoholic, drug addict, and former investigator for the Internal Affairs Division of the Denver Police Department, was just released from a state psych ward where he landed when his wife, Lucy, was killed in a boating accident last spring. Or, she may have committed suicide. She was slowly dying from leukemia and had been depressed. Then again, Phineas may have shot her, an act he occasionally hallucinates. The reader never actually learns the facts behind Lucy's death. They're not what's important here.<br /><br />This surreal, very edgy noir novel opens around Christmastime, with Poe drinking vodka at a hotel bar. A stunning woman in red sits down beside him. Her name is Jude. \\"She has a scar at the edge of her mouth and disturbing eyes. Her body is like a knife.\\" It has been too long since he sat so close to a woman. The two go up to his room. She is $200. richer before they open the door. When he awakens, he does so in a tub filled with melting ice and watery blood, minus a kidney. The lovely lady has absconded with the vital organ and left our hero oozing, but neatly sutured...er stapled. She also left a note for Poe - \\"If you want to live, call 911.\\"<br /><br />Events only become more bizarre as the tale continues. Poe leaves the hospital way too soon, nauseous, weak, still bleeding and barely able to walk. He has to find Jude. She has stolen his heart along with the kidney. Definitely smitten, Phineas wants one more tete-a-tete with this scalpel wielding woman. He wants her body, along with some champagne, before he finally kills her. Their reunion is his ultimate goal, although he is so high and hallucinatory most of the time, that occasionally the two are together and Poe is unaware of it. Phineas would like to recover his kidney too, and see if it is possible to reinsert it. He calls his friend Crumb, proprietor of a local sex shop, \\"The Witch's Teat,\\" who practices medicine on the side. Crumb takes care of gunshot wounds and even dental work, for the poor and the desperate. He is not a doctor, or even a past med student, but he does have a closet filled with old medical texts. He is certainly able to dispense friendly advice, check on Poe's wound...and even better, give him morphine for the pain. Somewhere around this point, Poe discovers he may, or may not, have a bag of heroin stuffed inside him where his left kidney used to live. The heroin is payment for the organ Jude stole and was supposed to have delivered. Did she deliver?<br /><br />Poe and Jude hook up, finally, and go on an implausible mission together with an objective I am not totally sure of - but it doesn't matter. It's the getting there that's important -the things that happen along the way. Look at the \\"Wizard of Oz!\\" From Denver to Las Vegas to El Paso, the two meet a succession of sinister, twisted men and women who usually wind up dead: Crumb, Eve and Georgia, Rose White, Moon, Blister, Pooh, Luscious Gore, etc.. One needs to suspend disbelief to get into this paranoid nightmarish scenario. And when one does, it all fits into place nicely. I had a blast reading this rather compelling novel and intend to read Will Christopher Baer's other two Phineas Poe books, \\"Penny Dreadful\\" and \\"Hell's Half Acre.\\"<br /><br />Baer's first-person narrative, sometimes dreamy, sometimes incoherent, always strong, is perfect here once the reader is able to loosen up and go with the flow. What does that mean, actually? Well, reading \\"Kiss Me Judas\\" is like having a fascinating conversation with an intelligent person who is often out of his head. Jude pumps Phineas full of liquid Valium and morphine, for pain and to control him, so his mind does wander far and wide, and he is the one telling the story - with great flair and occasional confusion. Once you get the rhythm and understand the tangents, it works. Trust me! This quirky novel is well worth the read. And I loved the conclusion - it suits!<br />JANAoor and the desperate.

She is a necromancer of such power that you have traveled halfway around the world to consult her. She is my human servant, without a mark to hold her to me. She dates me without vampire glamour.\\" So speaks Jean Claude, Master Vampire of St. Louis, as he describes the love of his very long life, Anita Blake, to a perspective client - one of the undead. And Anita is back, in Book 6 of Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake Vampire Hunter novels, as feisty, savvy, sexy and talented as ever!<br /><br />Anita's preternatural powers are increasing, and in \\"The Killing Dance\\" the lines begin to blur between her humanity and the supernatural. Always an uncompromising and tough lady, she's is developing a hardness, a detachment, that frightens even herself. An assassin has been hired to murder Anita. There's a $500,000 price on her head...and she's only a human! No one knows who, or what, is responsible for contracting the killer. Anita's friend, of dubious nature, bounty hunter Edward, alias Ted Forrester, has volunteered his services as detective and bodyguard. Her two love interests, Alpha werewolf and wannabe \\"leader of the pack,\\" Richard Zeeman, and the aforementioned Jean Claude, are the ones most capable of protecting her. They attempt to put rivalry and jealousy on hold until the emergency is over. Meanwhile, the brutal werewolf king Marcus and his sadistic lupa Rania, producer of S&M porn movies between shapeshifters and humans, are determined to fight Richard and Anita to the death - although Raina would like to film them first. Ha!  An extremely powerful, unpredictable new vampire enters the picture. Centuries-old Sabin is dying of an illness lethal to vampires and needs Anita's skill to help cure him. Dominic Dumare, Sabine's human servant and necromancer extraordinaire, accompanies his master to St. Louis. The pair have a malevolent air about them. Could their intentions be equally so?<br /><br />There are major pluses in \\"The Killing Dance, and a few minuses also. The best of the best: Anita is inducted as a lukoi, (pack member) and Richard's mate; she also sees Richard \\"change, an event which alters their relationship significantly; a triumvirate of power is formed with unlikely members; a gala opening of \\"Dance Macabre,\\" Jean Claude's newest enterprise, is held and the costumes are even wilder than the guests and the entertainment. On the downside, after five episodes of struggling through relationship problems with Ms. Blake, I think the resolution here is a bit facile. And there is a major and surprising denouement in \\"The Killing Dance\\" which may disappoint readers.<br /><br />Ms. Blake is an excellent writer who, with much flair and pizzazz, mixes fantasy with mystery, romance and dark humor. Her take on this derivative genre is a most unusual one. Unlike the other novels in the series, the characters and their relationships take precedence here over the mystery. The humor, as always, adds much to the novel....and there are plenty of laughs to counteract the violence. Ms. Hamilton's descriptive prose is outstanding, whether depicting room decor, landscapes, unlikely beings and characters, or the results of Jean Claude's outrageous penchant for designing clothes. These novels are addictive and will rivet the reader. I suggest reading them in order for maximum reading pleasure.<br /><br />JANA<br />There are major pluses in \\"The Killing Dance, and a few minuses also.

If you prefer the metaphysical over the mundane, the author also raises some intriguing questions about the nature of death and freewill.<br /><br />Paul Mason, a successful writer of children's books, and an English professor at a college in North Carolina, is fired for having an affair with a student. His wife, Penny, a surgeon, is now the only breadwinner in the family. She is devastated by her husband's infidelity. Their thirteen year-old daughter, Elise, is very troubled and recovering from a trauma she experienced a year ago. Withdrawn and depressed, Elise has been pulled out of public school and her father is homeschooling her. The family leaves their home in town and moves to their lake house, hoping to rebuild the marriage and their former close, loving relationship. After a brief time at the lake, Elise becomes more introspective and appears to hear voices and strange noises. Penny begins to have vivid, violent reoccurring nightmares. Paul meets and converses with an unknown woman, who seems very much at home on their property. There are indeed bizarre goings-on at the Mason house. However, Paul, Penny and Elise are estranged from each other and not communicating well. But it is only through pooling their knowledge that they will be able to unravel the mystery - and there's not too much time left!<br /><br />At almost the same time the Masons move to the lake, a woman awakens from a long coma. She is disoriented and remembers nothing about herself, her life or her family. Someone, a psychiatrist or doctor, works with her but tells her that only she can unlock her memory - if she wants to remember. She slowly determines that her husband and daughter are dead, in an accident. Her only wish is to return home. Finally, when she remembers her name, she is allowed to go home.<br /><br />Donna Boyd has written an eerie tale about worlds which exist on parallel planes.

Peter Straub has raised himself, in my estimation, from good genre writer to author of excellent fiction with his novel \\"Koko.\\" This is no light, scary beach read. \\"Koko\\" is a complex tale of a group of men who travel to hell and return with demons. It is a psychological suspense thriller that took my breath away. Straub's \\"Vietnam book\\" is far different from any other I have read. He didn't have to look far to discover evil monsters with which to terrify his readers. He was able to find them within the minds of his characters, men who served together in Vietnam. At the same time he was able to build a tremendous sense of sympathy towards his characters - those who fought for their country and returned far different men than they started out to be. I am of an age where I can recall the boys, my fellow high school grads, who went off to the Far East. This novel triggered the feelings of sorrow and loss I felt for those who never returned...and for those who did.<br /><br />Years after the end of the Vietnam War, four members of the same platoon meet in Washington, D.C., for the unveiling of the Vietnam War Memorial. Four men from totally different backgrounds, who chose different paths in life, Dr. Michael Pool, pediatrician; Harry \\"Beans\\" Beevers, the \\"Lost Boss, the world's worst lieutenant\\" - a lawyer; Tina Pumo, Pumo the Puma, whom Underhill had called Lady Pumo - a NYC restaurateur; and wild little Conor Linklater, a skilled carpenter.\\" These men are supposedly the only survivors of their platoon. They all bonded, once, in the brotherhood of combat. They closed rank throughout the traumatic period when members of their group were accused of committing My Lai-level atrocities in a little village called Ia Thuc. Now they will re-forge their ties to look for another platoon member - one whom they thought long dead - a probable murderer.<br /><br />A series of brutal, seemingly random slayings have been committed in the Far East. The victims were all foreigners - American, British, French. A calling card was left behind at each crime scene, leading the vets to believe that the killer was one of their own - an ex-soldier known as Koko. The four travel together, once again, to Singapore and then Bangkok in search of a an elusive and wily ghost from the past. Their pursuit becomes, in a sense, a last mission, an opportunity for closure. And it is also a time-out from their daily lives - a chance to evaluate and contemplate change. For their own purposes they are determined to catch-up with Koko before the police do.<br /><br />I was riveted to the page with \\"Koko.\\" Peter Straub has created some of the most phenomenal, realistic, and fully realized characters I have met on the written page. They are indeed a complex bunch of folk, especially the killer. The narrative is richly textured - beautifully written. At time I would pause and read descriptions over again, just for the pleasure of doing so and visualizing the scene in my mind's eye. And the story resonates long after the novel is completed. It is a tale of Vietnam and of lost innocence - themes which are not at all contradictory. Highly recommended!<br />JANAFrench.

On July 17, 1996, Trans World Airlines Flight 800 departed New York City's John F. Kennedy international Airport en route to Paris, France, carrying 212 passengers and 18 crew members. It departed JFK at about 8:16 p.m. eastern time and was climbing through 13,760 feet when, 14 minutes into the flight it exploded and fell into the Atlantic Ocean approximately 9 miles off Long Island. All 230 people onboard were killed. This is fact.<br /><br />Nelson DeMille's novel \\"Night Fall\\" is based on factual evidence. The author explores the controversy surrounding the cause of  the disaster which the US government still officially attributes to a spark in Flight 800's center fuel tank. The FBI interviewed 154 \\"credible\\" witnesses - including scientists, schoolteachers, Army personnel and business executives - who described seeing a missile heading through the sky just before TWA 800 exploded. They reported a \\"streak of light\\" hitting the plane just before it blew up.\\" Their testimony was disregarded. Today, more than eight years after the event, questions are still being raised about the accuracy of the findings - about a possible cover-up. DeMille's research is impressive. He stresses that the novel draws on published accounts, plus interviews with investigators and eyewitnesses to the crash. He says he has \\"tried to represent all sides of this controversy,\\" but adds that he has taken \\"dramatic liberties and literary licence when there is conflicting evidence.\\" This is, after all, a work of fiction. It is up to the reader to determine the level of believability.<br /><br />Bud Mitchell and Jill Winslow, an affluent couple in their thirties, are in the middle of an illicit love affair. They're set for a romantic evening at the beach. It's a rare occasion when the two can get away from their respective spouses for an entire night. They find a cozy spot below a dune overlooking the ocean at Cupsogue Beach County Park on Long Island, bringing with them wine, a blanket and a video camera. Planning to make passionate love on film, Bud and Jill are excited by the thought of watching themselves later on the VCR. Suddenly a terrible explosion lights up the sky. The sound of a tremendous explosion follows. The couple flees, taking the camera with them, as police cars speed toward the scene, sirens blaring. In the car, on the way back to their hotel, Jill discovers that the camera has captured the entire event. She and Bud are no longer the main feature. The date is July 17, 1996.<br /><br />Five years later, July 17, 2001, the crash of Flight 800 has been officially attributed to a mechanical malfunction. Kate Mayfield and her husband, John Cory, are both members of the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force. Together they attend the fifth year memorial service for TWA Flight 800's victims' families and friends. Kate was involved in the investigation and the case still haunts her. She has never been satisfied with the resolution and convinces John, an ex-NYPD detective, to take an interest in re-opening the investigation - on his own. Since they have been strongly warned by the FBI to stay away, the rogue, anti-establishment ex-cop becomes interested. When Kate introduces her hubby to credible eye witnesses and gives him a tour of the reconstructed airplane, his interest peaks. John is a superb detective and soon learns about a possible piece of crucial evidence that was never brought to light. He is determined to discover if it still exists, and in his search begins to see signs of a monumental cover-up.<br /><br />Mr. Demille is at his best here, as far as storytelling goes.The plot is riveting, the theory intriguing, the characters at once exciting, energetic and believable, and the ending left me stunned. Powerful!! Unfortunately, the writing is not his best. The humor is good, but it does fall flat more than occasionally. Since John Cory is the smart aleck, he comes off as obnoxious at times. I have seen DeMille use dark humor much more effectively. The plot, and the research that went into the writing, the suspense, more than make up for the pedestrian narrative. I remember clearly the evening of the crash and where I was when I heard the news. I felt terrible pain for the victims and their loved ones, and have always been interested in the reports and findings. It appears that the author has been very troubled by the tragedy. His concerns come across loud and clear. A must read!<br />JANAesearch that went into the writing, the suspense, more than make up for the pedestrian narrative.

There was no premeditation involved. In fact her death was an accident, although her burial was non conventional, to say the least. The event has been kept a secret for half a century. Is it coming back to haunt them and the town where she died? Now, fifty years later, the same men, much older and still residing in Milburn, find themselves terrorized by prophetic nightmares. In the dreams several of them die. And terrible things are happening in their small, sleepy town .<br /><br />Edward Wanderly, one of the quintet died the year before under tragic circumstances, which lead the others to believe that foul play had been involved. He appears to have died of fright. After their friend's death, the group of four begins to meet weekly, calling themselves \\"The Chowder Society.\\" They dress formally for the occasion, drink fine brandy, smoke the best cigars, and proceed to tell each other haunting stories about their past, although they never mention the murder. They all seem to be in denial about the possibility that the dead woman has come back to haunt them. One of the members begins a particular story, and a pertinent one by saying, \\"I won't tell you the worst thing I ever did, but I'll tell you the most dreadful thing that happened to me in my life, or it didn't happen and I imagined it all. Anyway, it scared the pants off of me. This is the worst story I know.\\"<br /><br />Desperate for answers, the group writes to Ed Wanderly's nephew, Don, an author, and ask him to come to Milburn. Don published a novel called \\"The Nightwatcher,\\" about shape-shifting supernatural predators. Unbeknownst to any of our protagonists, the novel has much in common with their reality. Nightwatchers, sometimes called Shapeshifters, are quasi immortal, demonic creatures who are able to assume human or animal forms or disguises. They are evil pranksters who despise humankind and derive a sadistic enjoyment from toying with their victims, often driving them to despair, madness and even suicide. Don returns as much for his own personal reasons as because of  request of the Chowder Society members.<br /><br />This is a spooky tale of supernatural revenge that can, at times, rivet the reader to the page. It is difficult to evaluate the book because many of the sections are above average, certainly as far as plot goes. Also, quite a few characters are sympathetic and interesting. However, the narrative plods frequently, and I found myself, both in the beginning and toward the end, skipping pages. I hate to do that but Straub becomes extremely repetitive. I found myself saying out loud, \\"I get it already!\\" Annoyingly, he will have an intelligent character open a door, behind which is obviously something no one wants to see. And the character does this over and over again - if he doesn't die first. Or he/she will walk up a stairway, at the top of which someone/thing bad is lurking. We all know this. But Straub insists. I roll my eyes. Cliches like this run through the novel and take away from the surprise and scariness. And the plot is not that original. How many times have we read about a town under siege by the undead, or something equally as horrifying? The author's earlier book, \\"Floating Dragon,\\" has a somewhat similar storyline.<br /><br />I am not sorry I read \\"Ghost Story.\\" I would certainly recommend it to fans of the horror genre.

Robb's futuristic mystery series. Set in New York City, 2058 CE, robotic drones and voice activated machines do menial work; there is a total ban on guns, (the police use lasers); major advances have been made in medicine, technology, and genetics; airbuses are the preferred vehicle for public transportation;  tele-links replace telephones; and people travel to other planets, (Venus, Mars), for vacation and business. It's not quite a brave new world, but there are significant changes midway into the 21st century. The overpopulated world has more limited resources - real coffee is rare and way too expensive, as is beef and other fresh meat. Robb has not written a sci-fi series, however. Far enough into the future to make the storyline more interesting, today's world is still easily recognizable.<br /><br />Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD is a tough cop who made Lieutenant before the age of 30. She, is also very vulnerable emotionally. Eve doesn't remember the early years of her life, but knows that she was sexually, physically and emotionally abused by her father, abandoned at age eight and left to the mercies of Children's Services.

Roarke is a charismatic Irish billionaire, who wields considerable power worldwide, and has fallen hard for the first time in his life - for Eve.<br /><br />Prosecuting Attorney Cicely Towers, a powerful, talented professional, is found dead, throat slashed, in a sleazy part of town. Eve is called in as primary to work the case. Then a second victim turns up. A beautiful, up-and-coming TV actress is found murdered, throat cut, on the rear patio of her apartment building. Eve is again called in -same MO, most probably the same killer. Unfortunately, both victims were involved with Roarke in the past. Obviously this development causes friction in their growing relationship - a relationship which is also stressed by Eve's discomfort with Roark's world of wealth, power and the &#34;beautiful people.&#34; Then there's the additional pressure of knowing that another murder will probably take place unless the case is solved ASAP.<br /><br />Again, J.D. Robb has come up with a winner. &#34;Glory in Death&#34; is a fast paced police thriller with top notch characters and an excellent plot. Although the murder mystery is primary, Roarks's and Eve's developing romance does add a lot and allows for a better insight into the complex characters of the two. The author's knowledge of police procedurals make the storyline more believable. The only problem I had with the book is that Roarke was a murder suspect in the first novel, &#34;Naked In Death&#34; also. This just seems too contrived to me. He is a man with an amazing number of business and personal connections. He knows half the world. It is a bit much to have a stable and respected figure like him suspected twice in a row.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the mystery and intend to read more of the series.

Animator, necromancer, called by vampires everywhere \\"The Executioner,\\" Anita Blake is a feisty, independent, 21st century lady who can't seem to get a date with a human being. In \\"Lunatic Cafe,\\" Book 5 of Laurell K. Hamilton's winning mystery-suspense-thriller-romance series,  Anita is in love with Richard Zeeman, a kind and handsome science teacher who just happens to be a werewolf - an Alpha Male. Anita thinks she can deal with his \\"condition\\" enough to consider marriage. Then she starts to see another side of Richard - one he has tried to keep suppressed. Lycanthropy just happens to be the principal theme of this novel, so the couple's problem is topical. The charismatic Jean-Claude, vampire extraordinaire, and Master of the City of St. Louis, finds it hilarious that Anita doesn't think Richard is \\"human enough\\" for her. Jean-Claude is wildly attracted to Anita, and also lusts to share her powers, but she looks down on his advances because he is a vampire - and the Head Vampire, at that. One thing to remember about Anita - she does not want to be controlled EVER!!<br /><br />Employed by Animators, Inc., to raise the dead, Anita's sideline is slaying vampires - the ones who murder humans. She collaborates with the police's Regional Preternatural Investigation Team when hunting the criminal undead. A call from her counterpart, Sergeant Rudolph Storr, informs her that a badly mutilated body has shown up in the hinterlands of St. Louis. A crime appears to have been committed, perhaps by a werewolf given the nature of the wounds.  Anita is convinced that a supernatural creature is the killer...but what kind of creature? \\"If there were no prints, could it have flown in? A Gargoyle maybe? It was the only large winged predator that attacked men. Except for dragons, but they weren't native to the country, and it would have been a hell of a lot messier. Or a lot neater. A dragon would simply have swallowed the man whole. Gargoyles will attack and kill a man, but it's rare. Besides, the nearest pack was in Kelly, Kentucky. What else could it be? There were a few lesser eastern trolls in the Ozarks, but not this close to St. Louis.\\" In any event, whatever killed the human, the local sheriff and cohorts are determined to hinder Anita from discovering the truth.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Anita's greedy boss Bert, always out to make a buck, passes off a missing person's case on her. Several members of Richard's \\"lunarly disadvantaged\\" pack have disappeared. Richard is entangled in a fight over the leadership of the pack with fellow werewolf, and present leader, Marcus. And Jean-Claude is growing increasingly hostile about what he perceives to be a lovers' triangle. Rage, vindictiveness and jealousy, anyone? Anita may have removed Jean-Claude from the picture permanently, but according to Jean-Claude's ego, he is way ahead of all the competition.<br /><br />As if this isn't enough to fill a book, a sub-plot concerning snuff/porn films involving lycanthropes and humans is revealed. The films and murders lead Edward, called \\"Death\\" by the vampires, to join the case, to the chagrin of Anita and the undead.<br /><br />Dominance is a major issue in \\"The Lunatic Cafe.\\" Aside from Richard vying for \\"leader of the pack\\" status with the unlovable Marcus, and Jean-Claude constantly asserting himself as Master Vamp of St. Louis, Anita has to constantly prove that she can take on all comers and still survive. And she is challenged all the time....and gets beat up badly, frequently, but does prevail.<br /><br />Laurell Hamilton is at her best in \\"The Lunatic Cafe.\\" She is an excellent writer who, with much flair and pizzazz, mixes fantasy with mystery, romance and dark humor. Her take on this derivative genre is a most unusual one. The mystery is at the fore of her novels and the supernatural takes second place, almost taken for granted as part of Anita Blake's natural world. And Ms. Blake is a delight - witty, savvy, hard-boiled, as in tough, and a majorcynic with a tender heart. This gal has attitude with a capital \\"A.\\" I highly recommend this series. A warning, however - to really enjoy these novels, and the characters' development, the books should be read in order.

399100:US	51247650	R82WJCMG52ERY	0486424499	363093333	Jane Eyre (Dover Thrift Editions)	Books	5	248	289	N	N	A Masterpiece For The Ages - Superb!!	I first read \\"Jane Eyre\\" in eighth grade and have read it every few years since. It is one of my favorite novels, and so much more than a gothic romance to me, although that's how I probably would have defined it at age 13. I have always been struck, haunted in a way, by the characters - Jane and Mr. Rochester. They take on new depth every time I meet them...and their's is a love story for the ages.<br /><br />Charlotte Bronte's first published novel, and her most noted work, is a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story. Jane is plain, poor, alone and unprotected, but due to her fierce independence and strong will she grows and is able to defy society's expectations of her. This is definitely feminist literature, published in 1847, way before the beginning of any feminist movement. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the novel has had such a wide following since it first came on the market. It is also one of the first gothic romances published and defines the genre.<br /><br />Jane Eyre, who is our narrator, was born into a poor family. Her parents died when she was a small child and the little girl was sent to live with her Uncle and Aunt Reed at Gateshead. Jane's Uncle truly cared for her and showed his affection openly, but Mrs. Reed seemed to hate the orphan, and neglected her while she pampered and spoiled her own children. This unfair treatment emphasized Jane's status as an unwanted outsider. She was often punished harshly. On one occasion her nasty cousin Jack picked a fight with her. Jane tried to defend herself and was locked in the terrifying \\"Red Room\\" as a result. Jane's Uncle Reed had died in this room a little while before, and Mrs. Reed knew how frightened she was of the chamber. Since Jane is the narrator, the reader is given a first-hand impression of the child's feelings, her heightened emotional state at being imprisoned. Indeed, she seems almost like an hysterical child, filled with terror and rage. She repeatedly calls her condition in life \\"unjust\\" and is filled with bitterness. Looking into the mirror Jane sees a distorted image of herself. She views her reflection and sees a \\"strange little figure,\\" or \\"tiny phantom.\\" Jane has not learned yet to subordinate her passions to her reason. Her passions still erupt unchecked. Her isolation in the Red Room is a presentiment of her later isolation from almost every society and community. This powerful, beautifully written scene never fails to move me.<br /><br />Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane away to the Lowood School, a poor institution run by Mr. Brocklehurst, who believed that suffering made grand people. All the children there were neglected, except to receive harsh punishment when any mistake was made. At Lowood, Jane met Helen Burns, a young woman a little older than Jane, who guided her with vision, light and love for the rest of her life. Jane's need for love was so great. It really becomes obvious in this first friendship. Helen later died from fever, in Jane's arms. Her illness and death could have been avoided if more attention had been paid to the youths. Jane stayed at Lowood for ten years, eight as a student and two as a teacher. Tired and  depressed by her surroundings, Jane applied for the position of governess and found employment at Thornfield. The mansion is owned by a gentleman named Edward Fairfax Rochester. Her job there was to teach his ward, an adorable little French girl, Adele. Over a long period the moody, inscrutable Rochester confides in Jane and she in him. The two form an unlikely friendship and eventually fall in love. Again, Jane's need for love comes to the fore, as does her passionate nature. She blooms. A dark, gothic figure, Rochester also has a heart filled with the hope of true love and future happiness with Jane. Ironically, he has brought all his misery, past and future, on himself.<br /><br />All is not as it seems at Thornfield. There is a strange, ominous woman servant, Grace Poole, who lives and works in an attic room. She keeps to herself and is rarely seen. From the first, however, Jane has sensed bizarre happenings at night, when everyone is asleep .There are wild cries along with violent attempts on Rochester's life by a seemingly unknown person. Jane wonders why no one investigates Mrs. Poole. Then a strange man visits Thornfield and mysteriously disappears with Mr. Rochester. Late that night Jane is asked to sit with the man while the lord of the house seeks a doctor's help. The man has been seriously wounded and is weak from loss of blood. He leaves by coach, in a sorry state, first thing in the morning. Jane's questions are not answered directly. This visit will have dire consequences on all involved. An explosive secret revealed will destroy all the joyful plans that Jane and Rochester have made. Jane, once more will face poverty and isolation.<br /><br />Charlotte Bronte's heroine Jane Eyre, may not have been graced with beauty or money, but she had a spirit of fire and was filled with integrity and a sense of independence - character traits that never waned in spite of all the oppression she encountered in life. Ms. Bronte brings to the fore in \\"Jane Eyre\\" such issues as: the relations between men and women in the mid-19 century, women's equality, the treatment of children and of women, religious faith and hypocrisy (and the difference between the two), the realization of selfhood, and the nature of love and passion. This is a powerhouse of a novel filled with romance, mystery and passions. It is at once startlingly fresh and a portrait of the times. Ms. Bronte will make your heart beat faster, your pulse race and your eyes fill with tears. The Best!!<br />JANAic room. She keeps to herself and is rarely seen.

Robb's &#34;Naked In Death&#34; was first published in July 1995. I am an avid reader and have only now  discovered Ms. Robb's &#34;Death&#34; series. These novels are romantic, futuristic, urban suspense, police procedurals. When I decide to read a series I always try to read the books in order. Thus I read book #1, &#34;Naked in Death,&#34;first. I couldn't put the book down and stayed up last night to finish it. I am now avidly reading book #2, &#34;Glory in Death.&#34;<br /><br />Lieutenant Eve Dallas, just barely thirty years old, is a police lieutenant in the NYPSD (New York Police and Security Department) Homicide division. New York City, 2058 CE, are the time and setting of &#34;Naked in Death.&#34; Robot drones and voice activated machines do menial work, i.e., clean house, serve meals; there is a total ban on guns, (the police use lasers); major improvements have been made in medicine and technology, with advancements in genetics (and strong genetic control); airbuses for public transportation have replaced subways; tele-links replace telephones - it's not a &#34;brave new world,&#34; yet...but there are definite pluses midway into the 21st century. Minor armed skirmishes have taken place between China and the US, and France had another revolution which lasted for a few years. The overpopulated world has more limited resources - real coffee is rare and way too expensive, as is beef and other fresh meat.<br /><br />As the book opens, Eve is suffering a trauma because of  the terribly violent murder of a little girl that she couldn't prevent. Eve killed the girl's father, the perpetrator, but the image of the child is stamped on her memory and she is having difficulty in sleeping. She is awaiting &#34;Testing,&#34; a psychological and physical evaluation all police officers must undergo after utilizing maximum force &#34; killing. &#34; However, this mandatory evaluation is postponed because of another case she is needed on immediately. The case is so important that the powers that be see it fit to break the testing ruled.<br /><br />A  prominent conservative senator's daughter is brutally murdered and the secret life of prostitution she'd been leading is revealed. The high-profile case takes Lieutenant Eve Dallas into the rarefied circles of Washington politics and society. The other detective on the case is her former partner, Captain Ryan Feeney, of the Electronics Detection Division.<br /><br />In this future, prostitution is legal as long as you obtain a license, (thus one becomes are a 'licensed companion'). The killer is targeting legal prostitutes in a series of cold, calculated murders. It is Agent Dallas' job to find out the truth: are the deaths done for personal issues? Political? Both? Or is it some random sociopath who gets a kick out of bloodshed?<br /><br />There is plenty of romance here, as well as suspense. Eve becomes involved with Roarke, (no last name), an extremely handsome, (what else?), Irish, self-made man who is a somewhat shady and a richer than Midas hero.  Roark becomes Eve's intense love interest. He is also the leading suspect in the investigation.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and am avidly reading book #2.

Author Susannah Indigo has written much more than an erotic novel with \\"Oysters Among Us\\" - although it will certainly awaken sleeping libidos! It disturbs me no end that this book is defined and marketed as \\"erotica\\" and limited, as such, to a smaller reading audience. While there is nothing wrong with erotica, per se, there is so much more than sex with a superficial plot in \\"Oysters.\\" And the narrative is composed of just plain good writing...magical prose! Pleasure here is not limited to flesh alone.<br /><br />Set at the beginning of this millennium, the novel consists of thirteen interlocking stories about a group of characters who are either family, friends, lovers, and the children of the above. Most live in Boulder, Colorado. A few live in San Francisco and travel to Boulder, or visa versa, to be with their loved ones. Together they explore their lives, loves, fantasies, dreams, (one of the characters is a psychotherapist), their potential for joy, and the limits of desire. These people just shimmer with life and together they celebrate the human identity. \\"The most important sin I observe every day,\\" says Madelaine, \\"is the failure to imagine and live out your very own life as it was meant to be.\\" Pain and regret often accompany delight and pleasure, and Ms. Indigo explores the darker side of the human experience also.<br /><br />Graceful, quirky, poignant, funny, very sensual, at times perverse, the stories just flow. Their very structure is fluid, and they will catch the reader up from page one. The characters are wonderful, unique/unusual, and well developed. They all interact throughout the book, no matter who is primary in the particular tale or chapter.<br /><br />Some of the people you'll meet through the \\"Oysters Among Us\\" narrative are:<br /><br />China Sunflower Thomas - 26, a sensual redhead in love with Jack and learning to \\"fly.\\" She is known for cooking with foods considered to be aphrodisiacs throughout history. Her menu for a \\"Better Than Sex Party\\" is saffron fettuccine with fresh lavender, white asparagus and crab meat salad, oysters Casino, a sauce of truffles,  chocolate rum trifle, and more.<br /><br />Jack Iverson -  professional photographer, lover of China...with a perpetual wandering eye, who gets punished for his Don Juan behavior and loves every minute of it.<br /><br />Annie Braverman: 36, naturopath, mother, wannabe courtesan. She oozes eroticism, loves Sam, own many editions of the Kama Sutra, in multiple languages and plans to memorize them all. \\"People often think the Kama Sutra is just about sexual positions, but it encompasses all the sensory pleasures of daily life - good food, silken clothes, perfumes, music, paintings, gardens. Somebody should revise it for the 21st century - how to make each day voluptuous from start to finish. Of course, we'd have to update instructions like Art #48 - decorating chariots with flowers.\\"<br /><br />Sam - a handsome, middle-aged, Jewish, man who resides & works in San Francisco but really lives in Boulder where he loves Annie. \\"Sam changed a little at the Tantra class, all of us did. We agreed we should eat more oysters and more chocolate, pour kindness down like honey, find sex in our laughter and laughter in our sex.\\"<br /><br />Nobeko, almost 40, a masseuse, beautiful in mind, body and spirit, is extremely unhappy in her marriage. She begins to mysteriously find rare coins and has no idea as to whom they previously belonged or where they come from.<br /><br />There's also a woman who dances with snakes, a grandfather who reflects on the former lovers in his life and writes \\"The Book of Love,\\" masquerade balls with most unusual costumes...and so much more.

Sookie Stackhouse is an attractive, telepathic barmaid from Bon Temps, a small backwater town in northern Louisiana. She has always been ashamed of her \\"gift,\\" the ability to read other people's minds, because other people have always treated her as if she had a disability. What were they thinking?? The major disadvantages to her telepathy are Sookie's inability to keep the voices at bay, even though she has learned to shield herself somewhat. She has also been unable to have a relationship. How can you fall in love when you know everything your boyfriend is thinking? All in all, however, she has lead a quiet, ordinary life with her grandmother and brother Jason. The siblings were orphaned at an early age. Sookie's life is about to become exotic, Bigtime! She has always wanted to meet a vampire, since vampirism became legal a few years before the novel begins. Most vampires stick to themselves and feed without killing humans. They drink bottled synthetic blood with human supplements in limited amounts. Some even attempt to assimilate into the general population. Occasionally there are \\"unfortunate incidents,\\" a euphemism for the bloody slaying of a human,  but that would mean a stake through the heart for the undead perpetrator. There are also humans who exploit vampires by draining their blood to sell on the black market, or by finding ways to use their supernatural powers for their nefarious human purposes. This vampire exploitation figures mightily in the plot.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the new excitement in our heroine's life. Sookie is overjoyed. (her words not mine), to discover a vampire at one of her tables in Merlotte's Bar - a tall, dark and very handsome one, if unfortunately pale. When asked his name, he<br />replies, \\"Bill.\\" Sookie exclaims, \\"The vampire Bill! I thought it might be Antoine, or Basil, or Langford! Bill!\\" Just plain Bill is in town because he inherited a piece of land, and wants to make his home in Bon Temps and live as normal a life as possible, under his circumstances. He was alive to fight for the Confederate cause, which gives him a major \\"in\\" with the town's Descendants of the Glorious Dead Society. He is immediately attracted to the very appealing Sookie, with her all American girl looks and sweet innocence, as opposed to the more skanky women he meets in vampire society, the \\"fang-bangers\\" or vamp groupies. Sookie is not able to read Bill's thoughts, so there is blessed quiet when they are together. And they fall in love.<br /><br />Bill's arrival in Bon Temps coincides with the murders of several young women, all bar maids known to hang-out with vampires. These gruesome murders have a major impact on Sookie and on her relationship with Bill. I might add that the mystery is a tough one to figure out, for a change. I like to be stumped!<br /><br />Author Charlaine Harris's \\"Dead Until Dark,\\" is a terrific romantic suspense novel - and very refreshing. The writing is excellent, as is the humor and plot. There are no unnecessary elements or ploys here. The characters are wonderful and well developed. I really like the Anita Blake Vampire series by Laurell K. Hamilton and was ambivalent about beginning Ms. Harris' Southern Vampire series. How different could the characters and plots be from each other?? Very Different!! Anita Blake is a dark, cynical lady with a darker sense of humor, (and I love her for it)! She's a big city gal. The folks/creatures who surround her, the scrapes she gets into, and out of, are of a more sophisticated nature.

It takes a lot of convincing, but finally Shields accepts.<br /><br />Mara, an extremely independent woman who lives alone with her Jack Russell Terrier, Spike, is most unhappy with the idea of a live-in body guard, even one as handsome as Aidan. And even if he does cook while she is at work and walk her dog too.<br /><br />\\"Dead Wrong's\\" premise has terrific possibilities as a suspense thriller. Three evil men come into contact with each other and hatch an improbable plot that works. As soon as the first man is out of jail, he begins a heinous killing spree, thus living out the fantasy of one his fellow conspirators. Mariah Stewart's plot, however, becomes all too predictable. Her characters are more like cardboard cutouts than three-dimensional people. And the relationship between Mara and Aidan lacks chemistry. It's too shallow, to say the least. Most of the action is focused on the crimes and catching the killer. This is OK, but it certainly takes away from the novel's depth and complexity. And this is Book One in a trilogy. That means the two cohorts of this book's killer, get to escape and do their thing! Each thug gets his own book...with basically the same plot. There was barely enough meat for this storyline, let alone for two more.<br /><br />I'll give this 3 Stars, because there was enough mystery to keep me interested...at a low level.

After reading her novel \\"Kartography,\\" I wanted to read everything else she had written, and so came upon \\"Salt and Saffron.\\" Ms. Shamsie does not disappoint in this extraordinary book. She explores here the complexities of family relationships - the generational legends that approach mythology, feuds that last for one hundred years, births, deaths, loves, secrets and scandals. All these dramas are universal, but the author has focused her tale on the Dard-e-Dils, an aristocratic nawab family, descended from royalty as far back as the Mughal dynasty. This huge feudal clan made their home, before Partition in 1947, in Dard-e-Dil, India. Now most are Pakistani, and have been incommunicado with their former loved ones, on the other side of the border, since the declaration of Pakistani statehood. The clash between cultures, Pakistani and Anglo (British and American), and the prohibition of loving below ones class are also tackled here.<br /><br />Aliya, a Dard-e-Dil granddaughter, is our narrator and tour guide through the intricacies of the family tree, lore and history, providing the readers with some new chapters of her own. Aliya's voice is a strong and intelligent one, however, there are times when her humor - the play on words and American English slang - are just too cutesie, and become annoying. When the novel begins, Aliya is returning to her beloved home in Karachi after 4 years at an American university. She stops over to visit a cousin, Samia, in London and meets an American Pakistani youth, Cal/Khaleel, on the plane. The two have much in common, are attracted to each other and become even more so when he seeks her out at her cousin's apartment. While having coffee, Aliyah discovers that Cal's parents, American immigrants, are from the lower classes. Their Karachi neighborhood was in Liaquatabad, a poor area of the city, making Cal a most unsuitable choice for a boyfriend or husband. Samia sums it all up quite nicely when she comments,\\"The poor live in Liaquatabad. The Poor, the lower-classes, the not-us. How else do you want me to put this? There's no one we know who would have exchanged Karachi phone numbers with him.\\"<br /><br />Aliyah is linked as a \\"not quite twin,\\" with her aunt, the mysterious Mariam Apa, who elopes with the cook, another very unsuitable match. The legend of the \\"not quite twins,\\" and the curse associated with it, is explained in the novel, and it is a clever device used to link generations. The segments devoted to Mariam and Masood, the cook, and their culinary creations are literally scrumptious. \\"Curly shaped jalaibees, hot and gooey, that trickled sweet syrup down your chin when you bit into them; diced potatoes drowned in yogurt, sprinkled in spices; triangles of fried samosas, the smaller ones filled with mince-meat, the larger ones filled with potatoes and green chilies; shami kebabs with sweet-sour imli sauce; spinach leaves fried in chick-pea batter; nihari with large gobs of marrow floating in the thick gravy, and meat so tender it dissolved instantly in your mouth; lassai that quenched a day-long thirst as nothing else did and left us wondering why we ever drank Coke....\\". There are further descriptions of spiced lamb, fragrant biryanis, sweetmeats and desserts that will make the mouth water.<br /><br />\\"Salt and Saffron\\" is filled with enough enchanting tales to keep Shaharazad happy, but some of the \\"real life\\" story just doesn't ring true. In many cases extreme measures are taken by individuals to fulfill their lives and desires, and these acts have dire consequences as a result of breaking family taboos - taboos which often seem based on whim.<br /><br />Ms. Shamsie's prose is elegant, lyrical and witty.

Stephen King's \\"The Waste Lands\\" is the third volume in the epic Dark Tower series and every bit as good, if not better, than the two preceding novels. The plot and character development improve with every page, and the action and suspense are nonstop.<br /><br />Gunslinger, Roland, and his two companions Susannah Dean, formerly the duo-personality Odetta Susannah Holmes and Detta Walker, and Eddie Dean, previously a drug addict and mule in New York City, at last begin their quest for the Dark Tower. Both Susannah and Eddie are in training and well on their way to becoming gunslingers. First, however, the threesome must defeat Mir, the gigantic, insane cyborg bear, called Shardik by the Great Old Ones. Mir guarded the Portal of the Bear, one of Twelve Portals which form the endpoints of the Beams. There are six Beams running between the Twelve Portals which mark the edges of Mid-World. The point where all Beams cross is the nexus of all worlds. The three backtrack along Mir's path and find the Beam, which should lead them to the center-point where the Dark Tower lies.<br /><br />One of the most important events in this book, and in the series, is the entry of Jake, the boy, into the circle of questing companions. Jake was introduced to the reader in Book One, \\"The Gunslinger.\\" There had been a great paradox surrounding Jake's existence - the paradox of shifting realities. Had the boy died or was he still alive? Had he, in fact, ever really appeared in Mid-Earth? This paradox was slowly driving both Roland, in Mid-World, and Jake, back in New York City, insane. In a scene rich in symbolism, Jake is reborn into Roland's world with Susannah as his symbolic mother, Eddie as midwife and the Gunslinger as Jake's symbolic father. The Drawing of the Three is at last complete and a fourth companion is also added. Jake adopts a talking billy-bumbler. Billy-bumblers resemble a combination of racoon, badger and dog. This one is named Oy.<br /><br />This magnificent Ka-tet, (King's word for a group of people drawn together by fate), moves on the Path of the Beam toward the city of Lud, an urban wasteland, inhabited by degenerate survivors of gang wars. Jake is captured and miraculously survives his trek through the underground world of Lud, and the acquaintanceship of some of the most unsavory characters King has created yet. Now Blaine, the psychotic, suicidal monorail train enters the picture to rescue the companions-in-arms from Lud. Rather than carrying them to safety, the train takes them into further danger. Before leaving NY, Jake had picked up two volumes in a local bookstore - one a book of riddles and the other, a book called \\"Charlie the Choo-choo.\\" He was able to foresee the appearance of Blaine because of the train's resemblance to Choo-Choo Charlie. Spooky!<br /><br />\\"The Waste Lands\\" leave the four speeding towards their destination, Topeka, Kansas, Mid-World, at 800 miles per hour on a train that won't stop. The only chance for survival is Blaine's love of riddles. We are left with a cliffhanger. Can someone come up with a riddle original enough to halt the train and save their lives? See Book Four - \\"Wizard and Glass.\\"<br /><br />This third novel in the septet is rich in description of characters, cityscapes, landscapes and creatures. The changing relationships between the foursome, their growth as individuals and as a group, is really worth mentioning. King is at his best here. Adventure-packed, the book moves along at a fast clip. Characters who were introduced to the reader previously, are now fleshed out and really become three-dimensional. The level of suspense is dramatically increased. I am totally hooked on this series. At this point, I don't care how King ends his epic . I just know that he has taken me on a 1500 page ride, (approximately), so far and I have loved every minute of it. Nothing that occurs in future books can spoil what I have already read.

Devora Hawthorne has just come out from England to be with her colonial diplomat husband Gerald. The two have been married a little over a year, during which time they have spent six months apart. Unlike most of the British colony, Devora develops an interest in India - her people, culture, art, religions and food. She also has a difficult time adjusting to the strict class structure and rules of the British community. Gerald is a stickler for the rules. He makes it clear from the beginning that one does not have personal contacts with the Indians. It just isn't done. Of course, this only holds true for the British women. Gerald thinks nothing of having sex with the local serving girls. The theme here is a common one in novels of the British Raj. The British think their culture is by far the superior, and that they bring civilization to the natives, who are looked upon as lower class -- even the Indian royalty. This is a period of political strife and sedition in India with the Independence Movement in full gear.<br /><br />Devora is a sensitive, artistic woman and the heat and color of her exotic surroundings liberate her sensuality, rather than stifle it. She finds herself retreating from the formality of her station. She is invited, along with her husband and his colleagues to dine at the palace of the local Maharaja, a man of questionable morals. He is intrigued by her and invites her to a Hindu temple to view the religious and very erotic art. She also visits him alone at his palace a few times, and a sexual relationship begins between them. It is a very brief relationship, however, as the man lives up to his cruel and perverse reputation.<br /><br />Rohan, the head servant of the Hawthorne household is an educated man from a good family. He was forced to become a servant due to circumstances beyond his control. He is an aloof, introspective person, and, at first seems disapproving of Devora. There is tremendous tension between the two initially. She believes it to be over who holds sway with the servants and the house. As Devora begins to know Rohan - she hears him playing the piano and has some interesting discussions with him - the two begin an affair. There is a strong chemistry between them, on more than just a sexual level. Gerald discovers the relationship and only agrees to try to salvage the marriage if Devora will accuse Rohan of rape.<br /><br />This is a short but well written novel. I think it does the book a disservice to label it erotic. There are no really explicit scenes here and although the storyline is trite at times, there is more focus on plot and character than on sex. \\"Tea and Spices\\" is light and enjoyable reading.<br /><br />JANAseems disapproving of Devora.

Hamilton's Vampire Hunter novels, discovers in \\"Circus of the Damned\\" that she is a full fledged necromancer, as well as an animator and vampire slayer. She is truly a woman of many talents. Anita's boss contracted her out as paranormal advisor to the police's Regional Preternatural Investigation Team. Her friend and colleague, Detective Sergeant Rudolf \\"Dolph\\" Storr, contacts her, as the novel opens, to inform her that a dead body has been found - the first of many. After she examines the gruesome corpse, her worst fears are realized. The man had been brutally murdered, by multiple vampires. Apparently a rogue Master Vampire and pack members are on the loose in St. Louis, because rogues are the only kind of vampires who kill in numbers.<br /><br />It should not be possible for a rogue and pack to be operating in the city. Vampire extraordinaire, Jean-Claude, the charismatic Master of the City of St. Louis, should be aware and in charge of whatever undead creature enters his domain. Unfortunately, Jean-Claude, powerful as he is, is new to the job and is having difficulties asserting himself in his new position. Others are disputing his claims and vying for his title as city leader. Jean-Claude is a capitalist entrepreneur vampire, and owns the vampire strip club, Guilty Pleasures, the vamp comedy club, The Laughing Corpse, and also a circus called, Circus of the Damned, which features, amongst other acts: The Skinless Man, a voodoo ceremony with zombies rising from open graves, clowns from the other world, and snake charmer, Shahar, who works with the world's largest cobra - and boy (!) this baby is huge!! Perhaps if Jean-Claude didn't have his fingers in so many pies, he could better protect his primary job title.<br /><br />Anyway, Alejandro, the rogue vampire, happens to be the world's oldest creature and the most powerful one Anita has ever faced. He wants Anita to be his human servant so he can use her powers to help him gain control of..., well...everything. Jean-Claude, who has the hots for Anita, has given her a bite or two - just enough to make her 'almost' his own. However, he prefers to seduce Anita, not to force her. Anita thinks Jean-Claude is pretty cool too - but wants nothing to do with him because she doesn't want anyone, or anything, to have control over her. In other words, she prefers her men to be alive. So while these two undead studs are duking it out over the lovely lady and the St. Louis turf, she gets kidnapped by a lamia and cohorts, and taken to an underground cave where she fights for her life; struggles with a radical group of right wing activists who want to murder all vampires and undead creatures - even the innocent ones; continues to raise five zombies per night for her demanding boss, while training a new employee; begins dating the oh-so-handsome, and very nice, Richard Zeeman, a science teacher with a terrible secret, etc.. The novel culminates with a fabulous gang war scene in the middle of the circus - giving new meaning to the words \\"Live Entertainment!!\\"<br /><br />Laurell Hamilton just keeps getting better. Her characters are what makes this series so special. Anita is the author's secret weapon. This gal has attitude with a capital \\"A.\\" Her wit is wry and she is a major cynic with a tender heart. She is a feisty, attractive and independent 21st century lady who is as good at raising the dead as she is at slaying the undead. Ms. Blake's sense of morality is unique. No matter what the perks are, she refuses to become a monster - or even the human servant of a very sexy vampire who has fairly liberal ideas where women are concerned. She will never give up a human to a vampire, no matter what the crime. She'll never leave a man, or woman, behind. And she won't date corpses. Hamilton's minor characters are  fantastic also - in every sense of the word. The humor, dark as it is, never falls flat. The narrative is well written and fast paced. I highly recommend this book, but it will be more enjoyable if you begin by reading the first two episodes, \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" and \\"The Laughing Corpse.\\"<br /><br />JANAly recommend this book, but it will be more enjoyable if you begin by reading the first two episodes, \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" and \\"The Laughing Corpse.\\" <br />JANA	2004-12-31

A wealthy industrialist, with ties to organized crime, offers her over one million dollars to bring a centuries-old corpse back to life. She refuses, as she would have to use a human sacrifice to raise these ancient bones - and she will not commit murder. Meanwhile, the head of the police's Regional Preternatural Investigation Team, with whom Anita has a contract, is trying to contact her. It seems a zombie has gone berserk and is slaughtering people all over St. Louis. Fearing the grisly murders will continue, she is on the case immediately, questioning the likes of Dominga Salvador, an evil priestess of vaudun who would like to go into business with the powerful Anita, or else, kill her...slowly, if she refuses the offer. Also on the interrogation list are Wanda, a disabled prostitute in a wheelchair, and former lover of the above mentioned industrialist; John Burke, New Orleans Animator, in St. Louis for his brother's funeral, (another zombie victim); and Luther, the bartender at \\"Dead Dave's\\" - a hangout for vampires and vamp freaks. The charismatic Jean-Claude, now Master Vampire of St. Louis, who has a crush on Anita and expectations that she will become his human servant, accompanies her to the more dangerous areas of the city as a sort of body guard. He is, however, more dangerous, by far, than anyone/anything who would ever approach her on the mean streets.

King's Best Novel!!	\\"Wizard and Glass,\\" Volume IV of Stephen King's fantasy/western \\"Dark Tower\\" series is even better than the three books which preceded it. I didn't think it would be possible to top \\"The Wastelands,\\" Book III, but King has accomplished the task with great elan. The author's tremendous talents and consistency as a writer are evident here. I can only advise the reader not to begin this novel during a busy period in your life, as it will cause you to miss all sorts of deadlines. I really found it difficult to put this page-turner down.<br /><br />The novel opens with a wrap-up of the cliffhanger which began in Book Three, where bizarre Blaine, the psychotic, riddle-loving monorail tries to take the stoic Gunslinger and his companions on a suicide trip to a terminal destination. Given the dark humor, it's a really fun ride. The band of four...and a half, the Gunslinger, Eddie, Susannah, Jake and their talking dog-like pet, Oy the Bumbler, disengage from the wreckage of Blaine, and continue along the path of the Beam toward the Dark Tower. They finally take a rest, around a campfire, while Roland narrates the details of his quest, the whys and wherefores behind his decision to take this particular course. He tells the tragic tale of his lost love, Susan, and his beloved friends and companions Cuthbert and Alain, who all formed a magnificent Ka-tet, (King's word for a group of people drawn together by fate). These characters have been brought up in prior novels and all played a formidable role in Roland's past life...one which will haunt him to the ends of the changing world. \\"Wizard and Glass\\" is more a traditional fantasy novel than the other, more darkly fantastic books in the series. The forces of magic aren't often on the side of Roland and his friends, so they must rely on their wits or their weapons instead.<br /><br />Roland's father, the best Gunslinger who ever lived, sent him away from the Inner Baronies and looming danger, with his closest friends Cuthbert and Alain. All were disguised and took aliases. They arrived at their destination, the small seaside town of Hambry, in Mejis, on the outskirts of Mid-World, ostensibly to count the taxable goods for the Affiliation. The trio discovered that there was trouble brewing here also, worse than that in Gilead. They were in much more danger in the Barony of Mejis than they would have been staying at home. The town's officials had secretly defected to the side of John Farson, \\"The Good Man,\\" whose armed revolution was gradually destroying the world. Farson's group planned to use oil wells and refineries, built during the long-ago Age of the Old Ones, to create gasoline to power weapons of war. These relics of the past, and other resources, lay right outside Hambry. Cut off from communications and support, Roland, Cuthbert and Alain were up against powerful adversaries, men of evil and ill will, as they attempted to foil the plot.<br /><br />On their first night in Hambry, Roland met beautiful Susan Delgado, just sixteen, a year or so older than he. The two fall deeply in love. Unfortunately she had been coerced into giving her promise to the lecherous, aging Mayor to be his future lover, (and future mother of his child - he hoped). His wife had been unable to bear him children after 40 years of marriage. Susan was unable to break the contract without staining her family's honor. The young lovers entered into an illicit affair - one which endangered the lives of them all.<br /><br />It is difficult to summarize the richly detailed and intricate plot of \\"Wizard and Glass\\" and do it justice. The characters, major and minor, are outstanding - they just come to life on the page. There's the ancient witch who becomes addicted to Farson's pink crystal ball, and whose hatred for Susan will prove to be disastrous for the Ka-tet; Jonas the failed gunslinger, banished to the West long ago, and his two cronies - all in Mejis to do Farson's work; Cordelia, Susan's deranged aunt who is eaten up by jealousy, guilt and her own pettiness; Sheemie, who is devoted to Cuthbert for saving his life, and proves to be loyal and courageous - an honorary member of the Ka-tet. And, of course there's young Roland, the newly made Gunslinger, who longs to lead his friends with honor and be worthy of his father's name; Alain, serious, noble and gifted with the Sight; Cuthbert the cutup, who is so like Eddie; Susan, a strong young woman, with her dream of first love finally realized, and so much to lose. King demonstrates a huge talent for creating a wide variety of characters and weaving them into a credible community. His narrative is rich in vivid detail and the pace is fast-going enough that I had a problem deciding where to pause. Ultimately, the reader is given an understanding of why Roland is the man he is. And this is a good place to acquire it. Roland, while never unsympathetic, has always seemed a bit too stoic - a hard, ruthless, unsentimental man who will kill for his cause.<br /><br />I think this is Stephen King's best book ever, and certainly one of the best novels I have read in a long time. One of the high points, for me, is the way the author brings in characters and themes from his other books, pointing out to the reader that the figures of evil in all his work are the same throughout - no matter what their names. Whatever the storyline, the purpose of total destruction remains consistent. It may have taken the author a long time to get this book out, but it is sure worth it. \\"The Dark Tower\\" is really Stephen King at his best and most ambitious. He examines here, in this extraordinary epic, the importance of mythology, and of the quest, in man's life!

I hate to go against the grain here, but if I had not been raised on J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Ring Trilogy,\\" and if I had not read tales of faeries and mythology omnivorously as a child, I would be kinder when reviewing David Edding's \\"Pawn of Prophecy.\\" Tolkien, however, and superb folk and fairy stories are difficult acts to follow. I think it is important to mention, if it is not obvious with my first sentence, that I came to this book, and series, as an adult. Children and adolescents should take to it much more enthusiastically than I. I also have little patience with cliches. And David Eddings begins Volume I, Book I of the Belgariad with a biggie - the battle between Good and Evil, fought by the most obvious of opponents. There are few shades of gray; one is either a supporter of one destiny or another.<br /><br />The Prologue provides the reader with the mythology of the Gods, and the history of the tremendous war amongst them which triggers major changes in the face of the earth, all its Kingdoms, its peoples and their alliances. There is a Great Lord of Evil, Torek One-Eye, who steals a most powerful Artifact through which one can wield mighty power. The Lords/Gods of Good, must regain possession of the Orb or the Dark Power will reign supreme. Humans are used as avatars to do the Gods' bidding. A company of humans, heroes all, must go on a dangerous quest to wrest the precious jewel back from the Dark One's clutches. Sound familiar?  And there is a young boy, (a \\"child of destiny\\" ), who leads them - an orphan -a seemingly normal child, who is being raised in the hinterlands as a household servant by his aunt, the cook. The boy, Garion, is the heir to the most noble of lines, and has a great purpose in this series. Substitute Tolkien's Ring, or Arthur's Sword for the Orb, and Gandalf or Merlin for Aunt Pol and one basically has the storyline. Now, I never expected author Eddings to reinvent the wheel, but he could have made his plot more subtle, more of a challenge. I was a third of the way through Book One when I had things pretty much figured out.<br /><br />I will say, in spite of overdoing the tried and true, the book has definite merit. I enjoyed many of the Belgariad characters. It is difficult not to like Garion, or be at once fascinated and delighted by Aunt Pol. Eddings has a definite flair for creating vivid characters, so alive they come right off the page. However, none of them are quite tested to their limits. Again, I think the novel, and the series, lack edge. The humor is terrific at times, as is the dialogue. The \\"evil ones,\\" however, are not anywhere near as scary as they could be, and as a veteran of some rather frightening books peopled by some terrifying beings, this was a disappointment. Again, this \\"flaw\\" turns into a plus for a younger audience.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Pawn of Prophecy\\" is well written and moves along at a good pace. I would definitely recommend this for teens interested in fantasy, and I think reading this aloud to a child would be a fun experience.<br /><br />JANAmore of a challenge.

I'm a Manhattanite and can't think of another city where I'd rather live than this melting pot mix of a metropolis. To my mind, Pete Hamill is the quintessential New Yorker. A lifelong resident, former editor-in-chief of both the New York Post and New York Daily News, author of eight books, among them the best selling memoir, \\"A Drinking Life,\\" and \\"The Subway Series Reader,\\" Hamill knows more than most about the five boroughs, especially downtown Manhattan. He has certainly paid his dues, or rent, with 14 different residences during his lifetime. (unusual, as New Yorkers usually hold on to their apartments, forever). A cynical newspaperman, from the old school more than the new, Hamill was born in Brooklyn, the son of Irish immigrants. He is struck by those who, like his parents, fought for a brighter future while remembering what they left behind. \\"That rupture with the immediate past would mark all of them and did not go away as the young immigrants grew old. If anything, the nostalgias were often heightened by the coming of age. Some would wake up in the hot summer nights of New York and for a few moments think they were in Sicily or Mayo or Minsk. Some would think their mothers were at the fireplace in the next room, preparing food. The old food. The food of the Old Country.\\" As a child, looking with wonder for the first time at the gilded spires of Manhattan, from the pedestrian ramp of the Brooklyn Bridge, Hammil asked his mother in an awed voice, \\"What is it?\\" \\"Sure, you remember, Peter,\\" she said. \\"You've seen it before.\\" And then she smiled. \\"It's Oz.\\"<br /><br />Hamill's fast paced, fascinating narrative meanders with readers on a tour of lower Manhattan. His view of the city is a pedestrian's - which is the best view, if one doesn't need to be in the driver's seat. Hamill never learned to drive until he was 36. I have to laugh. How typical! What Manhattanite drives their car in NYC?? From the tony haunts of the \\"Knickerbockers\\" to the \\"lost cities\\" of Five Points, we travel with a most worthy guide. We are still able to see remnants of the British colony, the mansions of the robber barons, and the speakeasies of the 1920s.  We wander with the author along the winding streets of Greenwich Village, to the grimy alleys of the meatpacking district, to the cobblestones of South Street Seaport, where the Fulton Street  Fish Market and Dock once stood. I was surprised at how far uptown Mr. Hamill's \\"downtown Manhattan\\" ventures. But hey, it's his city too....to redefine or define. The author defends himself, \\"Broadway in my mind is an immense tree,\\" Mr. Hamill explains, \\"with its roots deep in the soil at the foot of Manhattan, which is why I insist so stubbornly to my friends that the uptown places I cherish on Broadway are actually part of downtown.\\"  And if the old Thalia movie theater, at Broadway and 95th Street, is also part of his \\"downtown\\" experience, well, he's not the only one who got a first glimpse of Fellini, Kurosawa and Bergman there. So...that counts enough to place the old cinema below 14th street. Right??<br /><br />In this extraordinary book, which is both a personal and historical portrait, Hamill pays tribute to fellow New Yorkers like: Alexander Hamilton, who was shot dead in a duel with Aaron Burr across the  North River in Weehawken, NJ, in 1804.  Hamilton's grave graces gothic Trinity Church's centuries' old cemetery; Pearl Street's Captain William Kidd, who was hanged for piracy in London in 1701, \\"would not be the last New Yorker whose friends insisted he was framed;\\" John Jacob Astor, who emigrated from Germany in 1784 and became America's first millionaire; architect Stanford White, who designed the Washington Square arch and was the victim of New York's \\"murder on the rooftop garden\\" as a result of his love affair with the infamous Gibson Girl, Evelyn Nesbit; and authors like Henry James and Edith Wharton, who chronicled their times from a New York perspective.<br /><br />Nostalgia is a major theme that runs through the book. \\"Nostalgia,\\" proclaims the author, \\"is the city's ruling passion, after greed, anger and resistance to authority.\\" (I smile).  He says, and it's true, that New York changes so quickly. \\"That every generation watches its own past being demolished\\" - a very acute observation! The Dodgers left us. Penn Station is gone...and so are so many small, neighborhood restaurants, cafes, movie theaters, that were important in an intimate way to our individual lives. Hamill is at once awed by the city's energy and haunted by her losses. As with all New Yorkers, September 11, 2001, weighs heavily on his heart. He lives in Tribeca, in the shadow of the former Towers, and witnessed the horror of that day and its terrible aftermath up close and personal. Hamill explains that the New Yorker's version of nostalgia is much more than a remembrance of lost buildings or the presence of those who lived in these places years ago. \\"It involves an almost fatalistic acceptance of the permanent presence of loss.\\" \\"This makes New Yorkers tougher,\\" he argues, \\"less sentimental. It has helped them move on after the attacks on the World Trade Center.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Hamill covers much ground in this wonderful biography of a city. He is able to give us a first hand impression of the abstract expressionists who thrived here in the 1940s and 50s, as well as bebop, jazz, the Beats who made Greenwich Village the \\"Village,\\" and many other old landmarks and legends. He integrates personal recollections along with historical observations for an outstanding mix of a memoir...and make no mistake, this is a memoir, of a city and a man who lives and breathes the city. While he waxes nostalgic, Hamill also believes that the city's changes make her stronger.<br /><br />The author's prose is sharp, clear - beautifully written. His plain-spoken narrative vibrates with life. And it is obvious how heartfelt the writing and observations are. Mr. Hamill is not an objective observer - no way! He is heart and soul a New Yorker, writing about the hometown he loves.

The world has been cursed by the White Witch and her seven unnatural sons, the darkangel vampyres.<br /><br />Aeriel is a slave, a foreigner in Avarra, the country of her mistress, Eoduin. A marriage is to take place in their village and, as customary,  Aeriel and Eoduin are out gathering nectar-flowers for the wedding. Without warning, Darkangel, the dark-winged vampyre, sweeps down upon them and carries off the lovely Eoduin to be his 13th bride. The young slave is blamed by Eoduin's parents for the kidnapping. Now, alone, bereft, without her lady, who has also been her beloved companion since infancy, Aeriel seeks to be taken by the same Darkangel in order to find and avenge her mistress. Returning to the scene of the kidnapping, she sees the face of the Darkangel for the first time when he comes to take her to care for his thirteen wraithlike wives, including Eoduin. Aeriel is awed. \\"Then he opened his wings, and Aeriel found she could not move for wonder. Before her stood the most beautiful youth she had seen. His skin was pale and white as lightning, with a radiance that faintly lit the air. His eyes were clear and colorless as ice. His hair was long and silver, and about his throat he wore a chain: on fourteen of the links hung little vials of lead.\\"<br /><br />Darkangel flies Aeriel to his gargoyle guarded castle. Her task is to weave clothes for the thirteen wraiths. Although once beautiful young women, as each becomes the Darkangel's bride, she, overnight, turns into a withered creature with no blood, no heart, and no soul. All their souls hang around their husband's neck in vials of lead, to be given to the Water Witch, a lorelei, after he collects just one more. In only twelve months, the last bride will be taken and he will become the true seventh vampyre son.<br /><br />Aeriel's dilemma is whether to destroy her vampyre master for his evil deeds or to save him for the sake of his beauty. She has seen a spark of greatness through the ugliness of his spirit. The miserable wraiths and Talb, a dwarf-like man who lives underground, convince Aeriel to kill him. They have been victims for a long and terrible time. So, she sets off on a dangerous quest, (aren't they all?),  to find what is necessary to rid the world of the monster.<br /><br />Filled with faery legends and lore, this is both a fascinating myth-like tale and a dark romance. The icarus vampire shines here as dark goth hero.

Roland Deschain of Gilead, The Last Gunslinger, awakens in the middle of the night on the shore of Mid-World's Western Sea to find that he is being attacked by a horde of \\"lobstrosities,\\" crawling, carnivorous creatures which resemble large, deadly lobsters. He finally escapes their clutches, and discovers himself badly wounded, having lost the first two fingers of his right hand to the bottom crawlers. He has been poisoned by the lobstrosities' venom and will become extremely sick - at risk of dying. Thus opens Volume Two of Stephen King's The Dark Tower series, \\"The Drawing Of The Three.\\" It is urgent that Roland acquire penicillin in order to remedy his illness and continue his quest for The Dark Tower, the complete nexus of time and space. He has dedicated himself to putting right whatever is wrong with his world, which has \\"moved on,\\" decayed.<br /><br /> Crippled, dehydrated, and dying from blood poisoning,  Roland encounters a door, standing alone and freely on the beach. The door opens only to Roland's touch, and it leads to our world, Earth, New York City, sometime in the 1980's. He must draw three people from Earth, (NYC), to accompany him to the Tower. Defiant Eddie Dean, \\"The Prisoner,\\" is the first of the three, and he needs to act fast to help Roland get medication before he dies.<br /><br />Eddie's selection was foretold by the man in black when he read the cards for Roland at the end of Book One. Dean is a junkie, a heroin addict and smart - but obviously not smart enough. He's also a cocaine mule for drug kingpin Enrico Balazar. Roland walks through the door on the beach and from the moment he crosses the threshold, he shares Eddie's mind and body - sees the world through Eddie's eyes. Eddie finds himself \\"possessed\\" by the Gunslinger while on a plane headed for JFK. From the TWA flight to their detention by Customs for carrying a load of \\"coke,\\" to a shoot-out with Balazar and friends, with an eventual stop for penicillin, Eddie's and Roland's quality time together is one harrowing adventure after another, to say the very least. The two finally make it back to the Western Sea in \\"the other world,\\" with medicine. Roland quickly learns the rules of passing through portals, the language and slang of NYC, and begins to acclimate to the mystical principles of this new Mid-World<br /><br />A second door is discovered and Roland crosses the threshold into NYC in the early 1960's, and looks at the strange landscape through the eyes of \\"The Lady Of The Shadows' - not one, but two women in one body. Odetta Holmes is a young, beautiful civil rights activist who is wheelchair-bound. Detta Walker is a hate-filled, crazed, sly woman who inhabits the schizophrenic Odetta's mind. When these two are pulled into Roland's world serious problems arise.<br /><br />Jack Mort, \\"The Pusher,\\" is Death, (\\"but not for Roland.\\"). He is also the evil, serial killer behind the third door. He literally pushes people to their deaths. Amongst his heinous crimes, Mort has killed and maimed two people close to Roland. He is also at the heart of a mind boggling mystery - a paradox, which confounds The Gunslinger. Their time together in New York (1970's), is the wildest and woolliest yet. King does great work in this episode. Mort serves his purpose and receives his just reward. The author uses the trips to Earth and the characters he encounters there to deal with the earthly issues of racism, feminism, mental illness, the trials of adolescence, etc..<br /><br />Eddie and Odetta/Detta, who morphs into Susannah Dean, along with Roland, make three companions - gunslingers all.

This is a story of a family, the Mayfair family, and a city, Anne Rice's beloved New Orleans. It is also a saga of witchcraft, seduction, hauntings, incest, madness, murder...and of love. It is my favorite novel by the author and as many times as I read \\"The Witching Hour,\\" and I have read it a few, I always discover something new that delights and holds me spellbound.<br /><br />Rowan Mayfair is a beautiful, brilliant young woman and a gifted neurosurgeon. Although she knows that she has special extrasensory powers, she is totally unaware that she comes from an ancient line of witches. Rowan was born in the decaying family mansion in New Orleans, and was taken from her mother at birth and raised by an aunt in California. Now she is to inherit the Mayfair family fortune. There is another inheritance also. A powerful witch has existed in the Mayfair family in each generation for the past five centuries - but Rowan is not aware of this, nor does she know she is now the reigning Mayfair Witch .<br /><br />Michael Curry almost drowns while swimming off the California coast. Rowan miraculously saves his life. His close brush with death gives Michael supernatural powers, powers he does not understand and that frighten him. He and Rowan both share a history in New Orleans. He too was born there, and orphaned there at the age of five, and he is integrally tied to the Mayfair witches. The two are fiercely drawn to each other from the first, and fall deeply in love. Unbeknownst to the couple, as their histories are entwined, so are their futures. They return to New Orleans together, to the ancient Mayfair home, to solve the puzzle of Rowan's heritage and Michael's unwelcome extrasensory gifts. Assisting them in piecing together the family history is occult investigator Aaron Lightner. Ms. Rice uses the detailed documents of the Talamasca, a fictional group of scholars who have studied and chronicled occult happenings for centuries, to unfold the fascinating history of witchcraft and the family. The novel moves back and forth in time and space, from New Orleans in the 20th century to 17th-century Scotland, from today's San Francisco to Haiti and the antebellum south, and to the France of Louis XIV.<br /><br />Like the twelve Mayfair witches before her, Rowan senses and then sees the spirit called Lasher, almost from the moment she enters the Louisiana house. This otherworldly being was conjured up and named by the first family witch and he has, in turn, tormented every succeeding generation of Mayfairs. He has also gifted them with great wealth and prosperity. Now Lasher wants to come through from the world of specters to this world, and Rowan is the only one who can open the door for him.<br /><br />Ms. Rice writes a dramatic and compelling narrative. Her imagery is powerful. And no one captures the essence of the French Quarter, the streets, foliage and hidden corners of New Orleans, like she does. I was totally absorbed by the intricate Mayfair  family history. Each generation has their own stories. Many of the characters are flamboyant and outright outrageous, adding just the right amounts of magic, sensuality, spice and wickedness  to the storyline. And I felt compassion, not fear, for Lasher, who is one of the most unique figures I have encountered in all Ms. Rice's work. The ending is spectacular, but somewhat ambiguous. The first time I read the book I didn't realize there would be a sequel. Fortunately, there are two - so at the end of the \\"Lives of the Mayfair Witches Trilogy\\" all threads are neatly tied and no one is left in the dark.<br /><br />This is a fantastic series, with \\"The Witching Hour\\" being the strongest of the three novels.

Stephen King's fantasy/western, \\"The Gunslinger,\\" is the first of the books that comprise the extraordinary \\"Dark Tower\\" series. Roland Deshayn, or Roland of Gilead, is the last of a long line of noble gunslingers. He inhabits a world that has \\"moved on,\\" or is in the process of dying, and what remains is a wasteland. A man of few words, this enigmatic epic hero, (I picture Clint Eastwood as a younger man), pursues his nemesis, a sorcerer named Walter, the elusive \\"man in black,\\" leaving behind a trail of bloodshed. Most of the blood is shed by Roland's own hand, as he is forced to make crucial decisions, \\"degrading to his spirit,\\" in order to continue with his quest to seek The Dark Tower, the \\"nexus of all worlds.\\"<br /><br />As Roland makes his way across the brutal heat of the desert, the reader learns about the Gunslinger's past, and his knightly quest, through a series of flashbacks to an earlier time. Although nothing specific is described in this book, it is apparent that there were problems dealing with violence and revolution in Gilead, and a terrible betrayal - all provoked by Marten, Roland's father's court magician, a much greater sorcerer than Walter. These events could have precipitated the destruction and misery that is the present state of affairs in Mid-World. Roland's premature coming-of-age rite is described, however, as are the relationships of his youth, and a bloody showdown with the entire town of Tull. Through these episodes, one gets a clear image of a man, mature beyond his years, who has seen much and done more. And he accepted his fate long ago, while still a boy, with a foreshadowing of all the anguish he would cause and be caused on his quest.<br /><br />On his journey, Roland meets a man, a lone corn farmer at the edge of the desert. He is offered a meal, a bed and cool water, as well as some rare conversation with the farmer and his talking raven. Later on the trail, he meets the boy Jake at an abandoned way station. Jake was killed in a previous life on what seems to be earth, (NYC) - his death was caused by the man in black. Roland, although portrayed as emotionless and cold in his pursuit of justice, does develop an extremely strong attachment to the boy. The Gunslinger finally catches-up to the man in black for a final confrontation. The dark sorcerer tells Roland's future with a deck of Tarot cards and then dies.<br /><br />Obviously, as the series continues, Roland's journey will be a long one - after all, it has to last through seven books. \\"The Gunslinger\\" is almost guaranteed to travel through several different worlds before he reaches the Dark Tower. His next stop, in \\"The Drawing of the Three (The Dark Tower, Book 2),\\" will be the Western Sea.<br /><br />Author King sets a mood of total solitude here, a loneliness that is almost chilling. And the scenery is as empty, solitary, and almost as devoid of life as Roland's journey. I am aware that there are several characters in this novel, and not all of them exist in the past - but one is always left with the feeling that Roland is completely alone, with the man in black ahead of him, the only other living creature. The quest for the Tower is the only thing of import. Everyone and everything else is secondary. This series is supposedly inspired by Robert Browning's poem \\"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came.\\"<br /><br />This edition has been revised and expanded by the author. In his new introduction, King also credits J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy,\\" and Sergio Leone's terrific spaghetti western \\"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,\\" as having inspired \\"The Dark Tower books. I found it difficult to put this very well written volume down and can't wait to begin the next episode.

I loved every minute I spent reading Anne Rice's \\"The Witching Hour,\\" and therefore looked forward to reading the book's sequel, \\"Lasher.\\" I am certainly not disappointed now that I have finished the novel. I do want to mention here that although \\"Lasher\\" is part of a trilogy, it stands very well on its own as an independent work. I was almost as spellbound by this second book in \\"The Lives Of The Mayfair Witches Trilogy\\" as I was by the first. The author continues spinning this seductive story in a manner that captures the reader's interest and imagination until the very last page. The characters introduced to us in \\"The Witching Hour,\\" geneticist Rowan Mayfair, her husband, Michael Curry, their friend Aaron Lightner, along with a huge cast of ghosts, witches and Mayfair clan members, return to delight and chill, depending on your perspective. And some new folks, (not all human), come on board also. As the novel begins, the author summarizes the storyline and takes up the narrative at almost the same spot where the prior novel left us.<br /><br />Lasher, the former otherworldly spirit who haunted the Mayfairs, is now a flesh and blood supernatural being. He chose to leave the world of specters to join us humans in three-dimensional space on earth - New Orleans' steamy Garden District to be precise. He made this transfer through Rowan's birth canal. You have to read it to believe it. So Rowan and Michael, along with their many other roles, are also Lasher's parents. And you thought Rosemary and her baby had problems! Lasher, a very sensual, mesmerizing, manipulative entity, longs for love, yet doesn't really understand the human concept of the word. Therefore his motives are constantly misconstrued. And why not? He hasn't the faintest idea of how his actions impact others - a psychopathic supernatural entity? Or just your everyday misunderstood demon? You decide.<br /><br />Lasher is one of Ms. Rice's more complex characters. He has had a love affair with every Mayfair witch, down through history. Interfamily relations, as a consequence, are not what they could be. Talk about dysfunctional families! Also, Lasher's affection is all consuming - he tends to drain those whom he loves - an emotional vampire, in other words. And he is draining in the more literal sense too. Baby Lasher almost sucks the life out of Rowan as she breast feeds him. Rowan, as the reigning Mayfair Witch, and his Mom, is now center screen on Lasher's radar. He grows to maturity within days of his birth, (Taltos - what Lasher is - mature very quickly), and then he kidnaps Rowan. Obsessed with having a child by her so that his race, the Taltos line, will continue, Lasher rapes her. The only females capable of carrying Lasher's child  are witches, who have the required double length strand of DNA. If this strand of DNA is absent, the pregnant woman has a spontaneous miscarriage and usually dies. Yep! Rowan has the special strand. Lasher and Rowan have a daughter together, Emaleth. And this is not the first time Lasher has attempted to impregnate Mayfair women - with disastrous consequences. As Rowan lies in a coma, as a result of Lasher's attentions, he moves on to search for other Mayfair lovelies to impregnate. He really wants a son bad!! Much of this saga centers on Rowan's attempt to escape Lasher, and his pursuit of her and their child.<br /><br />The author delves more deeply into the Mayfair family members' characters and their histories here, especially Julian's, the only Mayfair Warlock. This tremendous Mayfair dynasty, made up of so many individuals over so many centuries, is the crux of what makes this novel tick. Ms. Rice gives them depth, fleshes them out more in \\"Lasher,\\" and their voices, as well as those of ghosts, angels, demons, witches, warlocks and ordinary men and women, contribute their points of view to the narrative. The plot is complex but not confusing. Much more family history is revealed than in the first book, and history is interwoven with fiction so that subplots become quite realistic. For example, it is discovered that Rowan is descended from a long line of witches who were exterminated by Protestants during the reign of King Henry VIII. They managed to keep some power in the family by moving to North America and intermarrying with their brothers and male cousin.<br /><br />The Mayfair family, with the help of the Talamasca, a group of scholars who have studied and chronicled occult happenings for centuries, eventually track down Lasher. They are then faced with a dilemma. Do they kill this entity whom they do not understand? He is otherworldly, but not necessarily evil. What would you decide?<br /><br />This is a magnetic, riveting read! I have read some negative reviews, and, as with everything else, people have different and definite tastes in fiction. As far as I am concerned, however, this is a real winner!!<br /><br />JANAis interwoven with fiction so that subplots become quite realistic.

Tall, handsome and born full-grown, these beings were eradicated by mankind centuries ago. Ash has lived for hundreds of years, since the Taltos were converted to Christianity in the 13th century, disguising himself, and hiding the history of his kind to escape annihilation. He longs for a Taltos mate so he can perpetuate his race. He contacts Rowan Mayfair, the reigning Mayfair witch, and her husband Michael Curry in 20th century New York. Ash knows that one of his race, Lasher, had been haunting the Mayfair family for hundreds of years, and was recently brought into the real world of man, made into flesh and bone, and then destroyed soon after. Rowan and Michael were the parents of two Taltos, now dead. Ash relates the history of his people to the couple. Ashlar's particular story, a tale of survival through the ages, is one of the strongest and most fascinating parts of this novel.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Rowan's niece, Mona Mayfair, discovers she is pregnant with a Taltos fetus, fathered by Michael, Rowan's husband. (Don't ask...you'll have to read what happened!). She runs away with her cousin, Mary Beth Mayfair, to protect her unborn child. There are many who would kill the Taltos baby in the blink of an eye. Mary Beth, the country cousin from the Bayou, is absolutely delightful and provides some comic relief in an intense narrative.<br /><br />Ashlar then discovers that the Talamasca, a group of scholars who have studied and chronicled occult happenings for centuries, is rife with corruption. Aaron Lightner, a dear friend of Rowan's and Michael's, is murdered by a renegade faction of the order who want to keep the history and legend of the Taltos secret. Ash decides to eliminate the evil, rogue element of the Talamasca  without destroying the entire group..<br /><br />\\"In \\"Taltos\\" Anne Rice takes the saga of a family haunted for hundreds of years by a supernatural being, and turns the tale into something more epic in scope. The story of Lasher's roots, the history and legacy of the Taltos, brings the trilogy into an almost mythical realm. While Lasher, as a representative of the Taltos, was viewed  as a threat throughout books one and two, \\"The Witching Hour\\" and \\"Lasher,\\" Ashlar changes the readers' perception of his race by revealing their entire history of contribution and persecution.<br /><br />Although I liked this book, it is the weakest novel of the three. I was certainly ready to have the loose threads tied together from the first two novels, but there is way too much information and unnecessary description here. The novel sometimes drags - the pace is too slow and there is too much filler. Precisely because \\"Taltos\\" is the trilogy's conclusion, anything and everything that has been left for last to be resolved, should wind-up here in a neat package. It doesn't. There is unnecessary rambling and too many repetitious summaries of the previous novels. However, there is still much here that is well worth reading, and the conclusion is a good one.<br /><br />Overall, this is a superb trilogy, filled with lore of the occult, the entire range of passions that generations of one, very odd family can contain, mystery, chaos, murder and much love.

He returns to his Midwestern hometown of Milhaven to be with his morose, callow brother Philip, and Mark, his fifteen year-old nephew. Shortly after Underhill's arrival, Mark disappears. Underhill is desperate to find the boy, especially when he learns that a brutal pedophilic murderer is on the loose in the vicinity. Tim's asks his friend Tom Pasmore, one of the best PIs around, for assistance in discovering Mark's whereabouts and the identity of the serial killer.<br /><br />Teenage skateboarder Mark Underhill had become obsessed by a mysterious abandoned house where the killer may have taken refuge. Unbeknownst to Mark, the house, which he had never noticed before, has strong ties to the Underhill family. He and his best buddy, Jimbo, eventually break in to explore, and to unravel the mysteries of this customized building, with its secret passageways and hidden hollows. Mark finds that the house almost talks to him - whispers to him of the horrors that have taken place under its roof. And in this  evil place, Mark discovers a soul mate, a ghostly girl who beckons him, coaxing him deeper into the darkness.<br /><br />\\"Lost Boy Lost Girl: A Novel\\" is both a disturbing mystery and a ghost story. It is not a traditional ghost story, however, but a tale of what happens when one believes in ghosts. This is also a novel about hauntings, sinister, filled with remorse and dread. Peter Straub touches on more traditional themes also, like dysfunctional families, the transition from adolescence to adulthood, and the onset of middle age.<br /><br />The tale is told from multiple viewpoints, and moves back and forth through time and space. It is all pulled together, however, by Tim Underhill's journal entries. Straub's narrative is elegant, compelling and rich. He clearly has a good ear for dialogue, especially as evidenced between the two boys, Mark and Jimbo. He has created here an atmosphere that is at once haunting, (as in a pervasive or lingering force - melancholy), terrifying and hopeful.<br /><br />I was riveted by this story and found the ending to be spellbinding.<br /><br />JANAthe two boys, Mark and Jimbo.

This is also a novel which moves unobtrusively through time and space, between the 20th century and the 17th, with barely a ripple, shifting beautifully between geographical locations, history and human relationships. Ms. Mukherjee interweaves here the story of a 20th century New England researcher with that of her ancestor, a Puritan woman, who roamed from the New World to India.<br /><br />Beigh Masters is a woman who \\"lives in three time zones simultaneously.\\" Not Eastern, Central and Pacific Time, but \\"the past, the present and the future.\\" Her Yale thesis on the Puritans led her to graduate school, and to a figure from the distant past, an ancestor, actually. At grad school she met and began her life with her lover, Venn Iyer. She also began her career as an \\"asset-hunter,\\" a detective of sorts, who seeks out antiques and other priceless items for wealthy clients. Venn, born and raised in India, and a graduate of MIT, \\"animates information.\\" He and his team are somehow recreating the universe by the mass ingestion of the entire world's information: newspapers, records and documents, telephone directories, satellite passes, every TV and radio show aired, political debate, airline schedule - well, just about every piece of information ever recorded. When the grid, the base, is complete, they hope to insert a person into time and space through this careful reconstruction of the past by the meticulous build-up of data.<br /><br />Beigh has a client who hired her to track down the most perfect diamond in the world - \\"The Emperor's Tear.\\" She has also been searching for a woman, known as Salem Bibi, who lived over 300 years ago. Beigh knows more about Hannah Easton, called Salem Bibi, than perhaps anyone who ever lived, and through her knowledge of this woman, she comes closer to finding the Emperor's Tear.\\" Hannah, born into Puritan society in Massachusetts in 1670, orphaned at an early age because of fierce Indian attacks on her settlement, married an English trader/adventurer/pirate. She traveled with him to England, and then to Mughal India, at the time of the establishment of the British East India Company. There Hannah became the lover of a Hindu raja and took-on the name Salem Bibi. She is the last known person to have seen and held the \\"Emperor's Tear.\\" She is also an ancestor of Beigh Masters.'<br /><br />\\"The Holder of the World\\" is both Hannah's and Beigh's story. And they are both remarkable women. Hannah lived centuries ahead of her time. She was born into the restricted Puritan world, in a new country with few amenities and much hardship. The New World was a dangerous and alien environment where women knew their place. Hannah, however, was an inquisitive, lively, vital woman, with a knowledge of self and a sense of purpose. She perhaps inherited her spirited nature from her mother, a woman whose terrible secret Hannah kept all her life.<br /><br />This is a beautifully written, complex novel of history, ideas and adventure. Bharati Mukherjee vividly creates a tale of relocation, the collision of values, transformation and the courage it takes to adapt to new cultures. And here two worlds do meet...and collide - the Puritan American and the Mughal Indian. Hannah guides Beigh, who in turn steers the reader through the centuries to solve ancient mysteries. I would have liked to have felt closer to Hannah. However, the author always seems to keep her at a distance, as a historic figure.

Forgive the pun, but Lisa Carey's \\"In The Country Of The Young\\" is a hauntingly, poignant ghost story. It is a novel that often enchants and provides a compelling read throughout. There are actually three tales interwoven here. Aislin's story: a melancholy tale of girl-child born out of wedlock to a woman of the lower-classes in Ireland, in the early 1840s - just before the potato blight. She is unwanted, unloved and lives a solitary existence, ostracized by all except her older brother, Darragh. There is Oison's story, along with that of his twin sister Nieve, beginning in the 1960s in Boston. They are the children of an Irish couple who do not love each other, and the tragedy of their dysfunctional family has an enormous impact on the two. And lastly, cohering all, is the story of Aislin and Oison in the present day on the island of Tiranogue, just off the Maine coast.<br /><br />The novel opens in 1848, when an Irish \\"coffin ship\\" carrying starving immigrants, including Aislin and Darragh, crashes off the coast of Maine. One-hundred-fifty souls are rescued, one hundred are children. Aislin is one of them. However, more are lost at sea, including Darragh. The survivors are taken to the nearby island of Tir na nOg, which is Gaelic for \\"Country of the Young.\\" There young Aislin, a beautiful, sensitive child,  dies, calling out her brother's name.<br /><br />Over a century later, the wee ghost of the girl-child Aislin makes her way to the home of artist Oison McDara. He lives as a recluse on Tiranogue, haunted by his twin sister's memory. Every year, for the last 30 years, on the night of the full moon equinox, (Halloween), Oison leaves a candle lit in his window and the door open for Nieve, his dead twin - in case she wants to come home. Aislin is drawn to the light, and perhaps, to Oislon's longing. As a boy, Oison had the gift of \\"sight.\\" When Nieve died, during their teen years, he lost this ability - but now he sees Aislin, clear as day.<br /><br />\\"In The Country Of The Young\\" is much more than a ghost story. It is primarily about the living, and though very sad at times, the narrative rings with life and color. Aislin has an opportunity, though brief, to live some of the life she lost when she was so young. Oison, emotionally dead for such a long time, also has another shot at life. And those whose lives they touch, are much richer for the experience.<br /><br />Ms Carey's prose is lyrical, rich, often just beautiful, as is her imagery. What really makes the novel special, however, are her characters, their depth, complexity and growth. She illuminates them all. They have remained with me well after completing the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this magical, uplifting novel.<br /><br />JANACountry Of The Young\\" is much more than a ghost story.

Although I would have given this delightful novel a more creative title - one which would inspire a wider variety of readers to take interest - Ms. Holly has written another winner with \\"The Demon's Daughter.\\" An off-beat, science fiction-fantasy, cum Dickensian Oliver Twist, cum romance, the book is set in Victorian Avvar, in the Empire of Aedlyne. Avvar is a city not unlike London during Victoria's rule. It is inhabited by humans and demons - the Yama. Like the aristocratic British, the Yamas have a strict hierarchical society. The aristocracy, called \\"daimyos\\" do not want to be tainted by mingling with the lower classes (people), or with their own outcasts, rebels who refuse to live within their own hierarchical system, (called \\"rohn\\"). Yamas are a humanoid species, extremely beautiful and gifted. They are able to communicate telepathically and can feed off of human life force without killing their victims. Humans crave the high technology that Yamas have developed and accept the \\"rohn\\" into their world in exchange for the use of this advanced technology.<br /><br />Inspector Adrian Philips, is a detective and peacekeeper, policing both human and \\"rohn\\" communities. He loves his work, is ambitious and has his heart set on moving up in his field, using whatever politics necessary. Roxanne McAllister is a lovely but eccentric artist, a painter, daughter of a deceased diva and an unknown father. She is an outcast from polite society because of her illegitimacy and her eccentricity. Roxanne lives on the edge of the Avvar slums with two boys who she picked up on the streets, starving and desperately in need of a home. Adolescent Charles, 5 year-old Max, (right out of Dickens), and Roxanne make-up an unusual but loving family of three...until Inspector Philips enters the picture.<br /><br />Roxanne finds Adrian literally on her doorstep, seriously injured after a fight with hostile \\"rohn,\\" and takes him in to care for him until he heals. The plot thickens with a huge dose of Ms. Holly's romance and erotica. The mainstream storyline is not bad either. One of the conflicts is that if Inspector Phillips follows his heart and stays with Roxanne, he will ruin his reputation and all chances for promotion. There are enough interesting subplots and unusual characters to make this a page turner. The two boys are adorable, Adrian's family is just too funny, and there's a chillingly evil doctor who steals children for experimentation to keep the plot edgy.<br /><br />This is a fun book, which mixes fantasy, intrigue, history, and sensuality, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />JANAge dose of Ms. Holly's romance and erotica.

I recently read Kevin Wignall's \\"For The Dogs: A Novel,\\" and was so impressed that I picked up his first book, \\"People Die.\\" Although not as good as the last effort, \\"People Die\\" is certainly worth 4 Stars and makes for an exciting and unusual read. It is an extremely well-written, fast-paced, edgy, spy thriller, with a bit of satire thrown in.<br /><br />William \\"JJ\\" Hoffman is the epitome of a professional. He's more-or-less a consultant in that the work he does is free-lance. And he has earned a reputation for himself as one of the best in his field - the business of assassination. His top clients include the CIA and M-16. He quietly and competently does the job, with no mess or complications. He is discreet and keeps his nose clean. As a matter of fact, some of his colleagues have actually said that if they had to be targeted for death, they would prefer JJ to make the hit.<br /><br />His last job, in Moscow, was the execution of an American businessman - a supposedly devoted family man found in bed with a teenager who appeared to be a prostitute. JJ was mesmerized by the beautiful and exotic young girl and allowed her to escape. Her image, her presence, will remain with him throughout the novel. When she left the hotel room, she carried a package with her. Fast-forward two years. JJ is in Paris to contact his primary handler. He finds the man dead in his home library, brutally murdered. As Hoffman professionally scans the murder scene, he gets a sense that this is not just an isolated killing. Something is terribly wrong. It turns out that JJ has every reason to be paranoid. Apparently his network is being downsized - drastically. And he is a prime target. He has no idea who to trust, especially after a very close and trusted friend tries to kill him. Wignall leads the reader through a maze of twists and turns, where nothing is as it seems. And then the author seamlessly ties everything together in a breathtaking conclusion.<br /><br />The character of \\"JJ\\" is extremely well developed. He is not just a man of action, as are many primary characters in suspense thrillers. There are periods where he becomes extremely introspective, especially when everyone he used to trust is dead or trying to kill him. He wonders how he ever became an assassin and if it is too late to lead a more balanced life. He has become marginalized - disconnected from his family and old friends. He finds himself isolated - totally alone. This darker, more melancholy theme gives the novel more depth than the traditional genre book.<br /><br />I discovered a terrific writer when I read \\"For The Dogs.\\" He doesn't disappoint with his 1st book either. I can't wait for his third. Kevin Wignall is an author whose work I highly recommend.<br /><br />JANAJJ\\" is extremely well developed.

This novel noir is a terrific suspense thriller which delves into contemporary Turkish politics, exploited Turkish immigrant workers in Europe, an up close and personal look at the French police system, neurological research and experimentation, plastic surgery, serial killers, amnesia, and memory distortion. Grange, a former reporter, demonstrates his journalistic background with his attention to detail and the depth of his research. The plot is somewhat reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's work. It features a woman with severe memory problems and bizarre scientific experimentation with the human brain. A fast-paced narrative, quick, accurate character sketches, very descriptive, almost graphic prose, and offbeat settings add to the novel's drama and uniqueness.<br /><br />Anna Helms, a lovely Parisian woman and wife of a senior police official, has been having serious neurological problems. She experiences temporary loss of memory, hallucinations and intense panic attacks. Sometimes she fails to recognize her own husband, and at others she feels she knows people she has never met. Both her neurologist, (a shady character), and her husband believe Anna may have a brain lesion. However, Anna will not allow them to take cortical tissue from her brain for a biopsy. She slowly begins to piece her life together, the parts she can recall, and nothing adds up. As she searches for her identity, Anna becomes more suspicious. Finally, she seeks alternate medical help.<br /><br />Simultaneously, in the same city, a vicious serial murderer is at work terrorizing the Turkish immigrant population. Three corpses have been discovered, all redheaded Turkish females, all workers from the same sweatshop, all brutally disfigured. Two French police detectives are at work on the case. Paul Nerteaux, is a good cop, dedicated, who has a real vocation for detective work. He brings a renegade cop back from retirement to assist with this case. Schiffer, called \\"The Cipher\\" or \\"Mr. Steel,\\" has broken all the rules too many times to count. However, he has an in-depth knowledge of Paris' Turkish community. They discover that \\"The Gray Wolves,\\" an extreme right-wing, Turkish nationalist group may be behind the killings. All the twisting, turning points of the story converge, explosively, in the brooding nighttime streets of Paris and the winding walkways of Istanbul.<br /><br />Grange's writing is spare and superb. His characters are all unusual, even the dead ones - the victims. And most have backgrounds steeped in violence. Yet Grange doesn't allow his readers to acclimate to the bloodshed or the brutality. The descriptions of the murders are quite graphic, so this is not a book for the faint-of-heart. Some of the scenes are haunting, others nightmarish. And the ambiance is dark, murky, almost surreal at times. Overall, I am so impressed by \\"The Empire Of The Wolves\\" that I plan to look for some of the author's other titles. Highly recommended.<br />JANAback from retirement to assist with this case. Schiffer, called \\"The Cipher\\" or \\"Mr. Steel,\\" has broken all the rules too many times to count.

From early childhood I have been both fascinated and terrified by vampire stories. I have an uncle to thank for this fear and for many a nightmare too. I would sit on his lap, whenever he visited, and beg him to tell me of Count Dracula's latest crimes, perpetrating evil against the people of the world. I even went so far, with my vampire obsession, as to ask my parents for a crucifix, to protect me against vampires. Since we're Jewish this presented a major problem, until my mother told me the Star of David would repel Dracula as well as a cross. I probably watched every film made about vampires and read several books on the topic, including romance novels where the vampire is the hero. So it is astounding that I never picked up Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" until last week. Yes, I knew the novel existed...but I kept putting off reading it. WOW!! What a great book!! It's the mother of all vampire stories with Count Dracula as king! It is the quintessential gothic story of suspense and horror, and beautifully written. I am awed and so glad that I finally read the book.<br /><br />This is not the 1st novel about vampires. Three 19th-century works of fiction preceded Stoker's novel. \\"Dracula,\\" however, is a kind of allegory which presents a vision of evil personified in the Count, and goodness portrayed by those who thwart him. The story is set in Victorian England, where the centuries-old, bloodthirsty monster, who preys upon beautiful, innocent victims, represents the dark underbelly of the moralistic Victorian society. The characters are very well developed and are severely tested in their zeal to rid the world of the vampire. The novel is narrated by their different voices. Through journals, diaries, letters, newspaper clippings, the reader is introduced, firsthand, to these principal characters, all antagonists of the vampire, Dracula. Telling the tale from different perspectives is an effective tool for understanding the people who play such important roles and allowing for more nuanced characters and plot development.<br /><br />Stoker's vampire is based on the 15th century Wallacian warrior, Prince Vlad Dracule. The author visited Romania and Hungary to read original historic manuscripts and to research local lore in order to write this book.<br /><br />A young solicitor, Jonathan Harker, leaves his beloved fiancee, Mina, to travel to a remote area in the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania. He makes the trip at the behest of a new client, Count Dracula, who purchased an estate in England and wants Harker's small law firm to represent him in matters of real estate, shipping and finance. Harker experiences unimaginable horrors at Dracula's castle and is fortunate to escape with his life.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dracula travels to London, setting up multiple households with coffins in each, where he may sleep during the day and escape the sunlight, so lethal to vampires. Lucy Westenra, a close friend to Jonathan's fiancee, Mina, falls victim to Dracula's bloodlust. Her illness and subsequent death bring into the picture her own fiance, two other men who admired her and Professor Van Helsing, an expert in vampires. The presence of evil looms, pervasive and sinister, over the entire tale, creating an oppressive ambiance.<br /><br />Author Stoker's writing is superb; his descriptions of landscapes and people are extraordinary, even haunting at times. The plot is gripping, which is extraordinary as most everyone knows how things will turn-out in the end. I am extremely impressed by the novel and highly recommended it.<br />JANAng for more nuanced characters and plot development.<br /><br />Stoker's vampire is based on the 15th century Wallacian warrior, Prince Vlad Dracule.

Allison Jensen, the principal character in \\"Wives And Sisters,\\" was raised in a Mormon household by parents who strictly adhered to the precepts of their religion, and to the practices of that extremely patriarchal and close-knit society. Allison, a child with a nimble, curious mind, learned by age six that there were many questions in life that should not be asked - because they would never be answered. When the Priesthood speaks on an issue, or more importantly when they do not speak, it is because there are some things congregants can never understand or be told. Members of the flock are expected to accept, without question, the word of God as understood by his prophets and interpreted by the Priesthood. Church members are strongly sanctioned if they look for answers elsewhere, as that would put them at risk of being introduced to new ideas which could lead them astray and into temptation. However, children, adolescents and many adults often become angry and confused when their very logical questions are never addressed. In \\"Wives And Sisters\\" author Natalie R. Collins has written a scathing commentary about a young woman's fight against the teachings of a fundamentalist religion, which has scarred her and caused her and her family a lifetime of pain, suffering and loss. Reading the novel, I did not get the feeling that Ms. Collins' anger is specifically directed against the Church of the Latter Day Saints, but against strict adherence to any fundamentalist religion where individual rights are subordinated to the needs of the entire community.<br /><br />Allison Jensen is haunted by the results of cover-ups, lies and rampant denial used to protect the Church at the risk of the individual members. Allison's rage is against the men who, in the guise of religious Elders and leaders, play God, ignoring the laws set forth by man and society. Men who, in order to protect their church, harbor those who commit crimes of the worst kind.<br /><br />When Allison was just six years-old, she witnessed a heinous event which would traumatize her for her entire life. She and her best friend Cindy were playing with their dolls by a shallow creek in the woods near their homes. Suddenly they were accosted by a bearded stranger who held them at gunpoint. He ordered the girls to take off their clothes, and when they refused, he grabbed Cindy while Allison took-off at a run. She never saw her friend again. Along with her feelings of horror and loss, she was weighed down with guilt because she had escaped and made no effort to save her best friend. Her parents and the Mormon community responded to the incident, and to the little girl's anguished questions, with a wall of silence. Rather than look to the police to begin an investigation, they avoided possible exposure, covering-up for a sexual predator, and ordered Allison to pray as a solution for her nightmares. Her father, always a strict disciplinarian, was ready with his belt if ever Allison or her siblings got out of line. Allison's mother, used as a baby-making machine, warned by her doctor not to have any more children, finally died as a result of a miscarriage when Allison was still quite young.<br /><br />As soon as she turned 18, Allison left home and paid her way through college in order to be able to support herself. She vowed never to return to the Mormon Church or community. The young woman begins a long search for herself and her place in the world, entering therapy, as a result of a serious bout with depression. She begins to discover that all the ghosts and monsters which lurk in her mind, are not figments of her childhood imagination. Many of her demons are real people, evil people, who committed crimes that were all too real. And these criminals are still around, stalking Allison and testing her sanity as well as threatening her life.<br /><br />Author Collins excels in developing Allison, an extremely complex character. She is, at once, filled with rage, yet still compassionate and loving - rebellious, but loyal and ready to lend a hand when needed, even to her father, stepmother and family who have so wronged her. Although she is intelligent and attractive, she is terribly insecure and desperately seeks love and male attention. Ms. Collins' other characters are just as well thought-out and 3-dimensional. The novel is more a coming-of-age story, a young woman's struggle to survive against an almost cult-like upbringing. There are elements of mystery and suspense, especially toward the end of the book - but this is more than a mystery-thriller. Overall, the writing is good, but I found the chapters to be extremely short, sometimes only a page and a half. This made for some choppiness and disrupted the flow of the narrative.

Kelley Armstrong's \\"Dime Store Magic\\" is the third novel in the \\"Women of the Otherworld\\" series. Like the preceding books, this one stands on its own and it is not necessary to read the other two to understand or to become involved in this one. I am/was so enamored of the original werewolf novels, and their heroine Elena Michaels, that I had my doubts about whether or not I would enjoy this new book starring, not lycanthropes, but witches. However, I quickly became absorbed in the story, and Ms. Armstrong's narrative is, as always, excellent and filled with her dark humor. Therefore I am able to recommend \\"Dime Store Magic\\" without hesitation.<br /><br />Twenty-three year-old Paige Winterbourne, recently orphaned, has inherited her mother's role as Leader of the elite American Coven of Witches. Paige, is not anywhere near as experienced in witchcraft and lore as her deceased mother, or as some of the elderly and very conservative witches in her Coven. She does, however, have a vision for the future - something sorely lacking now and very necessary. Paige has long been known for her rebellious antics and doesn't have much credibility with her fellow witches. In fact, many of them feel that the younger woman is not fit to lead. However, Paige's goal is an important one - to better her people and bring them into the 21st century - not to hide from the world, as the paranoid Coven Elders, little old ladies with blue rinses on their hair and polyester pants, wish to do. She strives to find hidden grimoires filled with ancient, stronger spells to help witches worldwide regain their rightful power in the supernatural world. Over the years, witches practicing \\"white magic,\\" for the betterment of the human and supernatural races, have lost power and status to Sorcerer Cabals - kind of like the Mafia, peopled by males, (sorcerers), who make black magic for profit. Paige wants to regain that power for the purpose of doing good.<br /><br />Nine months earlier, Paige's mother was murdered along with another witch who had an adolescent daughter, Savannah Levine. This precocious young women was left in Paige's care to train and to raise to adulthood. Savannah has supernatural powers far exceeding her age, and her potential for making magic is beyond what most witches can ever expect to achieve. Part of Paige's responsibility is to make sure Savannah's power is used appropriately. The powerful sorcerer Kristof Nash, heir to the Nash Cabal, is Savannah's father and wants custody of his daughter whom he has totally ignored heretofore. Obviously Nash recognizes the potential for evil in his daughter's powers and wants to use her for his own dark purposes. Paige is well aware that Kristoff dabbles in the black arts and would do anything in order to capture Savannah and control her, including murder. Lucas Cortez, a young and handsome sorcerer, heir to the most powerful Cortex Cabal and an attorney also, comes to Paige's rescue. This is completely unheard of, as witches and sorcerers have always been enemies. Yet, the two, witch and sorcerer, make miraculous magic together.<br /><br />Once again Kelley Armstrong succeeds in dazzling her readers with her outstanding, well-crafted plot and numerous new characters - as well as bringing back some old friends, (and foes), from former novels. Her portrayal of the sometimes troubled relationship between Paige, herself a young woman without too much life experience, and adolescent Suzannah, is extremely realistic and often moving. Paige's frustration with the narrow-minded Coven Elders, and their refusal to leave their old and ineffectual ways behind and move forward for the betterment of all, is described with maturity and sensitivity. The novel is chock full of excitement, adventure and romance. I can't wait to read the next book in the series!<br />JANAong with another witch who had an adolescent daughter, Savannah Levine.

Although this was the emperor's second marriage, it was a real love-match and Mumtaz was her husband's inseparable comrade, advisor, companion on his journeys and military expeditions, and the inspiration for his acts of charity and good deeds. Both the Muslim and Hindu populations thrived under the emperor's reign. Mumtaz bore him fourteen children, and died giving birth to their last child in 1630, (only three years after her husband's accession to the throne). Shah Jehan was overcome by grief and was determined to perpetuate his wife's memory for immortality. He wanted \\"to build a monument fit for his love. He called upon the Empire's greatest architect, a young man who could transform jade into flowers, marble into paradise.\\" This was the genesis of the Taj Mahal. The late empress, beloved by her people, inspired all the realm's subjects to join in the emperor's dedication to build this supulcher. After twenty-two years of intense labor, and the combined effort of over twenty-thousand workmen and master craftsmen, the complex was finally completed in 1648 on the banks on the River Yamuna in Agra, the capital of mughal monarchs.<br /><br />In \\"Beneath A Marble Sky,\\" author John Shors tells the beautiful story of the people most involved in the building of the Taj Mahal, and the complex circumstances surrounding their lives and the history of the region at this time. Jahanara, the intelligent and beautiful daughter of the Mumtaz and Shah, perhaps the child most like her mother, narrates this tale. Although Jahanara has many siblings, the primary plot here, other than the building of the monument, deals with the destructive rivalry between her two brothers, Dara, the oldest son and heir to the throne, a scholar, and the youngest, Aurangzeban, an ambitious warrior who covets his brother's position. This strife could cause civil war and threaten the Islamic Enlightenment, which prevailed during this period. The other important storyline deals with Jahanara's relationship with the architect, Isa. The princess was married to a brutal, coarse man who mistreated her. When her father asks her to become the court liaison to Isa and the construction of the Taj Majal, Jahanara is not only swept up in the creativity and responsibility of the project, but learns to love a man for the first time.<br /><br />Mr. Shor spends much time developing his characters, and does so effectively. Through them the reader is able to picture life and the political chaos of 17th century imperial Hindustan. His writing is often elegant and flows at a good pace. Although the author's historical detail is accurate, the narrative is mostly about the personal relationships between characters, their loves, betrayal, adventures and war. He does describe the building of the Taj Majal, but I, personally, would have appreciated more detail about the construction and final product - the magnificent mausoleum.

There have been nationwide discussions on the cause of events like these - especially during the 1990s when it seemed like school shootings ran rampant throughout the US. In Pearl, Paducah, Springfield, Littleton, seemingly normal kids, kids who had almost everything a child could want, became terribly derailed. Some argue that the proliferation of and easy access to guns is the cause; others that the excess of violence in movies, TV programs and video games induce violent behavior in children and adolescents. The one question almost everyone seems to have in common is, \\"What were these murderous kids' parents like?\\" \\"Didn't they recognize symptoms of violence in their own children?\\"<br /><br />Eva Khatchadourian, Kevin's bereft mother, narrates this novel through a series of compelling letters to her estranged husband, Franklin. She examines her son's life, from conception to his terrible act of violence, trying to understand the why of it. What becomes clear early on is that Eva tortures herself with blame. She is guilt-ridden that her shortcomings as a parent might have caused Kevin's evil act, his violent behavior, his very nature. She must have failed, she must have been deficient as a mother, for her boy to commit such a chilling crime. She also considers that neither nature nor nurture are solely responsible for shaping a child's character. Her honest, introspective correspondence to her beloved husband causes the reader to consider that some children just might be born bad. How and when are psychopaths created? The reader is pulled back and forth between empathy and blame, anger and grief, and perhaps, ultimately to forgiveness.<br /><br />Through Eva's perspective we watch a story unfold. A happy, almost idyllic marriage to Franklin; a brilliant career in a business which she, herself, created; her ambivalent feelings when she became pregnant, an event which interfered with her career; the indifference she felt when she held her son for the first time; Kevin's difficult infancy - he refused his mother's milk and didn't like to be held by her; his total manipulation of his father, who believed Kevin could do no wrong, putting a permanent strain on the marriage; Kevin's lack of empathy and cruel streak, which he blatantly flaunted in front of his mother and hid from his Dad; and Eva's fear that her dislike for her son, which she went overboard to conceal, would damage him - further escalating his already violent nature.<br /><br />\\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" examines how a heinous event can impact a town, a marriage, a family and an individual. It also causes the reader to reflect on the concept of unconditional love. Lionel Shriver's clear, crisply crafted prose builds tension throughout her novel, ultimately leading to a stunning conclusion. Her narrative is almost perfectly paced. This is an extraordinary psychological study that gripped me, riveted me, from the first page to the last. And the author ably portrays the complexity and the horror of the act and the consequences. I was seriously left breathless and horribly saddened after finishing the book. This is most definitely not an \\"up\\" novel or a light read. However, it may be my favorite book of 2004 and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

This is an extraordinary psychological study that gripped me, riveted me, from the first page to the last. And the author ably portrays the complexity and the horror of the act and the consequences. I was seriously left breathless and horribly saddened after finishing the book. This is most definitely not an \\"up\\" novel or a light read. However, it may be my favorite book of 2004 and I cannot recommend it highly enough. I have purchased 2 more of Ms. Shriver's novels as a result of reading this one. <br />JANA <br />	2004-11-28
442592:US	51247650	R3NP77LHSE84OA	1840680288	838014712	Image of the Beast / Blown: An Exorcism	Books	3	13	15	N	Y	An Apocalyptic Nightmare	WOW!! This is a far-out book, to say the least! Philip Jose Farmer, the best-selling author of the Riverworld series, and winner of 3 Hugo awards for his unique and creative Science Fiction novels, has written an apocalyptic nightmare of a novel with \\"The Image Of The Beast: An Exorcism\\" and \\"Blown,\\" the sequel. Both books, included in this one volume, were originally released 1968 by the Essex House in California, during the days of flower power, hippies and alternative lifestyles. It swiftly became an underground classic. This is not a novel for the faint of heart. Some readers may find it shocking - others, like myself, will think it \\"campy\\" and laugh at many of the characters and images. While reading this book I imagined Robert Crumb, creator of the underground Crumb Comics, (remember him?), illustrating a sci-fi comic book, filled with grotesque, malevolent characters, i.e., aliens, ghosts, witches, a satanic child-killer, werewolves, and a chilling snake woman in a tale which gives new meaning to gothic horror, with lots of kinky sex and fetishes thrown in. For those of you who do not remember Crumb, his work has been described as \\"...barreling out of his acid-drenched id. Basic desires, perversions, and blinding rage...\\" are what he depicts. Well, that's Crumb and that is \\"The Image of the Beast.\\"<br /><br />The storyline is typical enough. It is about a private detective searching for his partner's murderers. All similarities to other novels end here. P.I. Herald Childe views a snuff movie, starring his partner, who is so brutally murdered on screen that even hardened Investigator Childe takes some time-out to hurl. Childe, is driven into smog-ridden LA to pursue the killers. The smog is so bad the air has taken on greenish, foggy overtones and people need gas masks when they go out into the poisonous environment. Then a second film turns up at police headquarters, graphically portraying another murder. Various clues lead Childe to a horrific gothic mansion in the hills above LA, belonging to Baron Igescu, originally from Transylvania. Hmmmm. Here we meet the supernatural beings that make the Alien look like a kitty cat.<br /><br />Among the topics Childe discusses with Igescu on this first visit, is the concept that an infinite number of universes may occupy the same space. \\"They can do this because they are all polarized or at right angels to each other....thus it is possible for more than one cosmos to fill the same space.\\" The Baron speculates that there might be \\"walls between universes with gates or breaks in them\\" and that an occasional dweller of one universe might go into another. The plot thickens.<br /><br />I borrowed this book from a dear, but weird friend. I liked it initially - perhaps \\"like\\" is not the word. Anyway, I was initially absorbed. About halfway through the plot weakens, and at last comes to a whimper of a conclusion.<br /><br />\\"Blown\\" which follows \\"The Image of the Beast\\" is a continuation of the same terrifying fantasy world dragged out of the darkest depth of someone's unconscious mind. Mr. Farmer's? I am giving the novel 3 stars because the writing is excellent and the plot and characters are certainly original. Hard-core gothic sci-fi fans might enjoy this.<br />JANAhills above LA, belonging to Baron Igescu, originally from Transylvania. Hmmmm.

The novel is an example of satire at its best, biting, witty and at times, just plain funny. The humor, however, is very dark. Mr. Pierre's writing clearly demonstrates his contempt for the media, the US criminal justice system, capital punishment, and our contemporary culture's pandemic materialism. He takes on the seamier aspects of life in America, or more specifically, in a small town in central Texas, Martirio by name. Pierre's scathing indictment of the townspeople - their acquisitiveness; greed; mean-spirited gossip; fast food obsessions juxtaposed with their zeal for the latest fad diet; their dependence on television; and their pandering to mass media, an ever present post-tragedy intrusion into their daily lives - certainly paints a bleak picture of a community whose citizens come off poorly under duress.<br /><br />At the center of the turmoil is 15-year-old Vernon Little, a 21st Century Holden Caulfield who is desperately trying to come of age, while the people of his town are determined to give him the death penalty. Vernon narrates the story in highly idiomatic but expressive English, chock-full of malaprops. He is under arrest and charged as the accomplice in a brutal school shooting where 16 students were murdered. He has become the town's \\"skate goat\\" in the aftermath of a Colombine-style massacre committed by his best friend, \\"Meskin\\" (Mexican) Jesus Navarro. Vernon ponders his friend's death, \\"He keeps secrets from me, like he never did before. He got weird.\\"  Vernon, who is a flawed teen, obsessed with his bowels but certainly innocent of any crime, describes himself: \\"....lawless brown hair, the eyelashes of a camel, big ole puppy-dog features like God made me through a fu*ken magnifying glass. You know right away my movie's the one where I puke on my legs, and they send the nurse to interview me instead.\\" Indeed, author Pierre's talent for giving Vernon a true adolescent voice, crude language along with some brilliant insights and a sense of honor, is part of what makes this novel so strong. Vernon is at once a hormone driven, alienated anti-hero, and at the same time quietly grief stricken and noble. As events surrounding the case become increasingly chaotic, Vernon unwittingly becomes the victim of a nefarious conspiracy. His eventual and unavoidable demise is chronicled here.<br /><br />Author, DBC Pierre, (The \\"DBC\\" in his nom de plume stands for \\"Dirty But Clean\\"), aptly calls the novel, \\"A 21st Century Comedy in the Presence of Death. He is, in reality, a native-born Australian named Peter Finlay, who lived much of his early life in Mexico. Pierre effectively builds a sense of revulsion in the reader without using heavy-handed moralization. In fact he keeps us laughing through many a sick and twisted scenario. The author's narrative is uneven at times. There are moments of brilliance that fade into page after page describing the monotonous life of Martirio's citizens. The \\"redneck\\" dialogue and vernacular are colorful and believable, and Pierre's prose is often beautiful. He is a risk-taker and if you are willing to go along with him for the ride, it is certainly a wild one. The book's conclusion is a bit too facile and felt like a cop-out to me. However, the pluses far outweigh the minuses in this excellent and far-out novel.<br /><br />If you are easily offended by criticism of life in Texas, or in America, especially when not written by an American - then this is not the book for you. Otherwise, enjoy!<br />JANAor Pierre's talent for giving Vernon a true adolescent voice, crude language along with some brilliant insights and a sense of honor, is part of what makes this novel so strong.

It is absolutely terrific! In \\"Bitten\\" the author describes how Elena Michaels, a human woman, was bitten by her lover and turned into a werewolf - the only female werewolf in existence, as a matter of fact. It is in this first episode that the reader learns about Elena's Pack, and is introduced to the concept of werewolves and how they live among ordinary humans in today's world. Many of the same characters from \\"Bitten\\" appear in \\"Stolen,\\" but enough background information is available so that the plot and subplots flow and make perfect sense. Elena is the clever and exotic protagonist in both novels, which revolve around her struggles and adventures. She is also her Pack's primary investigator when sightings of unknown werewolves, non-Pack \\"mutts,\\" are reported. It is essential for werewolf survival that the existence of all werewolves be kept a secret, remain a myth, else humans try to destroy them.<br /><br />Elena comes across a Website that sells and auctions information on the paranormal; a supernatural eBay, so to speak. Pieces of spaceship wrecks, and material relating to \\"Zombies, Werewolves and Other Miscellaneous Demonic Phenomena\\" are sold for profit and apparently the site is doing a markup business. Elena, after her initial horror at being classified as \\"demonic,\\" reads on to find that particularly accurate information about werewolves was being offered for a price. Concerned, Elena contacts the source to investigate the claims and discovers that the \\"source\\" is a real-life witch - or to be more precise, witches. They know about werewolves, Elena's Pack in particular, and want to invite them to a meeting of supernatural races. The ad was a lure to hopefully elicit the response it did.<br /><br />Jeremy, the Pack Alpha, accompanies Elena to the meeting, a conference attended by vampires, witches, werewolves, demons, etc., in which, ironically, the primary topic of discussion is the recent kidnappings and purported murders, of their fellow supernaturals by humans. Computer billionaire Tyrone Winsloe is the alleged culprit, along with his scientist toadies, and a cast of characters so abominable that the \\"supernaturals\\" look like kitty-cats in comparison. Now Winsloe, who is funding a sadistic paranormal study, has learned of Elena's existence and is hunting her down. She is about to run straight into a trap.<br /><br />As I wrote before, in spite of a new and fascinating cast of characters, and the return of old familiar ones, Elena remains the strongest and most compelling of them all. She is Ms. Armstrong's prize invention. There are multiple subplots, one more interesting than the next and an abundance of conflicts. However, best of all, the author has introduced here a variety of supernatural species which will surely expand her possibilities for future novels. Armstrong's ability to juggle storylines, and change voices and points of view with her characters, strengthens her writing significantly.<br /><br />While \\"Stolen\\" is every bit as well written and developed as \\"Bitten,\\" I did prefer the latter novel. I really like the werewolf characters and especially the dynamic between Elena, her lover, Clayton, and Pack leader, Jeremy. Jeremy and Clay do not appear as much in this book.

Imagine Indiana Jones, (his name is Omaha Dunn here), taking-on 'the perfect storm' in the great Rub al-Khali, or Empty Quarter, in central Arabia. In this desert place, beneath the burning sun, hurricane force winds blow up quickly. One can drown in an ocean of sand and remain interred forever. Add to this mix, the obsession to find a great fabled city, and a civilization lost thousands of years ago, now buried beneath the shifting dunes. Ubar, a rich and fabulous trading center of ancient Arabia, ruled by the Queen of Sheba, once rose out of the desert and then mysteriously vanished back into the sands. References to Ubar in the Koran, the Arabian Nights, and countless Bedouin tales told around desert campfires have captivated the imaginations of explorers and archaeologists. But all searches have been fruitless and the city remained lost. The storm, the search for Ubar and for a source of energy strong enough to fuel the entire earth, are just the basics of this enthralling story. James Rollins' \\"Sandstorm\\" also contains various subplots, no less exciting than the primary adventure, a terrific cast of characters, fascinating historical and scientific information, a love triangle and enough action, suspense and thrills to keep you reading long into the night. This is one of the most addictive novels I have read in some time. Once I began, I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Dr. Safia Al-Maaz, curator of the Arabian wing of the British Museum was abruptly awakened one night by the smell of smoke and the sound of sirens. She looked out her window and saw her wing of the museum in flames, and chaos in the streets. Dressing in panic she ran to the site, a short distance from her flat. The Arabian wing, priceless artifacts, and all the work she had accomplished over a 10-year period, were totally destroyed by a tremendous explosion. Clandestine organizations worldwide were alerted to this event almost before Safia reached the disaster area. And so begins a dangerous, lethal race to discover what caused the explosion, why it happened and what it means.<br /><br />Lady Kara Kensington, Safia's best friend and sponsor to the Arabian gallery, is devastated also. Both women have strong roots in the deserts of Arabia. Painter Crowe, member of a secret American government organization, is tasked with finding the incredibly powerful source of the explosion before anyone else does, and if possible, to contain it. Answers to these questions and many more are to be found in the desert country of Oman and the Rub al-Khali, a forbidden land where evil spirits reign, and where, perhaps, lies the mysterious city of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. Lady Kensintron organizes a small expedition, including Dr. Al-Maaz and Crowe, to travel to Oman to find these answers. However, Kara's expedition is not the only group determined to discover the desert's secrets; other shadowy groups trail the expeditions every move.<br /><br />Again, I was completely riveted. The historic detail is amazing.

Nate Kenny, an African-American business entrepreneur, seemingly has it all: success, wealth, intelligence, youth, health and a wonderful marriage to his beautiful wife Monica. The only element missing in Nate's life, is what he has always wanted most - children. When Nate and Monica married, almost four years ago, he wanted to have kids right away. At age 36 he was more than ready to begin a family. His new wife, in her late 20s, was finally able to persuade him to postpone pregnancy for 3 years so they would have time alone together, to savor each other's company before taking on the responsibilities of parenthood. Three years later they learn that Monica cannot conceive. However, the doctors tell the couple, she would have been able to have children if she had attempted to immediately after their marriage.<br /><br />Monica, who wants a family very much and adores her husband, is devastated. Nate, however, is enraged, and acts as if Monica has purposefully thwarted his life's dream. He blames her for her failure to conceive, totally ignoring her terrible pain and the cruel impact of his rejection. From his point of view, he married Monica, who he loved, because he believed she would make the perfect wife and mother. She has certainly surpassed his expectations as his wife - but she is batting zero as a perspective Mom. And Nate wants what he wants - all of it! He believes the only solution to his problem is a divorce. After consulting his attorney, he discovers that since he began his new and thriving business after his marriage, a divorce settlement would mean splitting $60 million dollars with his spouse. He is not willing to do this. The only allowance in their prenuptial agreement that would release him from such a huge settlement would be if Monica were unfaithful. And that would be impossible. Or would it?<br /><br />On the other side of town, the nastier side, Lewis Waters is desperately trying to figure out how to bring in enough income to prevent his live-in girlfriend from prostituting herself. He and Serena live in the Ida B. Wells Housing Project with their small daughter, Layla, who Lewis adores. Serena is pregnant again and looks as if she may be using drugs...again. Lewis is not making enough money as a barber to keep his head above water. He is desperate to save his daughter from a life like her mother's.<br /><br />In a quirk of fate, Nate Kenny and Lewis Waters meet and become diabolically involved in each other's lives. Lewis, with no auto insurance, collides with Kenny's expensive luxury vehicle, totaling it. At his wits end, Lewis finally agrees to accept Nate's proposal - a brainstorm Nate managed to come up with at the auspicious moment of the accident. Nate will let Lewis off the hook for causing the crash, plus he will give Lewis a substantial sum of money, a new wardrobe, loan him a classy vehicle and a beautiful apartment in the best area of town. All Lewis has to do in return is seduce Monica.<br /><br />I thought at times, during the initial chapters, that the plot was much too contrived, especially the character of Nate Kenny. As I became more involved, however, the entire convoluted, bizarre storyline became totally believable. It all meshed. And the characters turned three-dimensional as the author fleshed them out. There are many minor characters, whom I have not discussed, that play important roles in \\"The Million Dollar Divorce.\\" RM Johnson brings them to life and really gives them motives and souls. It is not difficult to like or to really hate some of these people. Mr. Johnson also manages to juggle various subplots without distracting from the primary story.

Apparently I am not the only one to think this book is a marvel. As I write this review, it is shortlisted for the 2004 Whitbread Award for First Novel.<br /><br />In early 19th century Georgian England, the big news was the seemingly never-ending war with Napoleon Bonaparte. Of lesser interest, except to a few, was magic. All over the country small groups of men, theoretical magicians, scholars all, would meet from time-to-time to discuss the practice and history of magic. No one had actually practiced real magic for hundreds of years. A small society of theoretical magicians lived in the city of York. They had heard of a magician in Yorkshire, a Mr. Norrell, who had an extraordinary library of rare books on magic. They assumed that he was a theoretical magician, like themselves. A delegation of two were selected to pay a visit to Mr. Norrell in order to see his wonderful library. Norrell, reclusive, self-centered and socially inept, hoarded his precious volumes and seemed reluctant to share his books or his knowledge. The two magicians from York asked their host, &quot;...why magic has fallen from its once-great state in our nation? Our question is, sir, why is no more magic done in England?&quot; Upon which Norrell replied, &quot;It is a wrong question, sir. Magic is not ended in England. I myself am quite a tolerable magician.&quot; When the collective York society heard about Norrell's proclamation, they doubted his &quot;active magician&quot; status. They asked him to make some magic to prove his claims. Norrell, incensed at being called a fabulist, agreed to perform a magical feat in the York Cathedral on a given day and time. He then made a bargain with the society members that if he failed to live up to his claims, he would give his oath never to make any such claims again. However, if he should succeed, the members of the society would disband and promise never to claim the title of &quot;magician&quot; again. Need I say that Norrell proved himself beyond anyone's expectations?<br /><br />As the only practicing magician in England, Mr. Norrell, whose ambitions began to grow after the York event, moved to London with the intent of bringing magic back to his country. He also got the notion that he would like to use his magic to aid the British in their war efforts, thus bringing fame to himself and practical magic into the spotlight. Sir Walter Pole, a cabinet minister, saw no reason to utilize Norrell's services - after all, he had no military training. Then Norrell performed a truly unbelievable act of black magic for Pole, the kind of magic which he had thought to never use. That act persuaded Pole to accept the magicians assistance. Norrell's participation in the war managed to terrify the French. Unfortunately and unknowingly, Norrell's dark magic brought a thistle-haired gentleman from the land of faeries to London, who worked some very nasty magic of his own, and wrecked havoc in the world around him - as well as the Other World.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jonathan Strange, a wealthy gentleman who lived near the Welsh border, wanted to marry. Desiring a career, something meaningful to occupy his time in order to please his pretty young fiance, he decided to become a magician after finding he had a talent for the practice. Strange was quite different from Mr. Norrell, being young, handsome and charismatic. He too moved to London where his path crossed Norrell's. The older magician took the younger man on as a pupil. Norrell actually shared his books and knowledge with him, but his underlying motive was to control Strange's magical knowledge. When Strange decided he no longer needed Norrell, exactly what the older magician feared most, a feud began between the two which estranged them. Neither man, however was awareof the strange and dangerous being from the land of faeries who had entered their world.<br /><br />The above is just a brief summary of this tale's beginning - a tiny taste of the enchanting plot - and doesn't begin to do it justice. The book is narrated in a scholarly, (but not dry), manner, complete with footnotes which are almost as fascinating as the main story. It's as if a magician, perhaps a former colleague, were looking back in time and relating this history. The thread which ties the entire novel together is the prophecy attributed to the shadowy figure of the Raven King. As a child he was taken by faeries and later became king of both England and Faerie, and the greatest magician of all time. His prophecy: &quot;Two magicians will appear in England. The first shall fear me; the second long to behold me. . . .&quot; It is Susanna Clarke's spectacular, rich narrative that makes it all work - like magic.<br /><br />Ms. Clarke's characters are magnificent - so real they practically leap off the page. Her descriptions enable one to really get a three-dimensional picture of each one in the mind's eye. Ms. Clarke also gives the reader remarkable insight into human passions - envy, greed, ambition, friendship, love and redemption. Her take on English society during this period is often satirical, and very humorous at times.<br /><br />Oddly, I have heard some compare &quot;Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell&quot; to &quot;Harry Potter.&quot; I don't understand the comparison. The only commonality between the two is the world of magic. I could better compare this novel to the work of Charles Dickens, especially the way Clarke's characters and settings are brought to life by her vivid descriptions. I highly recommend &quot;Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell&quot; - a novel destined to become a classic.<br /><br />JANAof the strange and dangerous being from the land of faeries who had entered their world.<br /><br />The above is just a brief summary of this tale's beginning - a tiny taste of the enchanting plot - and doesn't begin to do it justice.

Her take on English society during this period is often satirical, and very humorous at times.<br /><br />Oddly, I have heard some compare &quot;Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell&quot; to &quot;Harry Potter.&quot; I don't understand the comparison. The only commonality between the two is the world of magic. I could better compare this novel to the work of Charles Dickens, especially the way Clarke's characters and settings are brought to life by her vivid descriptions. I highly recommend &quot;Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell&quot; - a novel destined to become a classic.<br /><br />JANA	2004-11-14

Masha Hamilton's prose is, at times, luminescent and lyrical, and at others, spare and almost brutal in its honesty. She paints here a poignant portrait of a woman facing a major crossroad in her life which will change her forever. This novel is more a sensitive psychological study than a book with an action driven plot.<br /><br />Catherine (Caddie) Blair is an American journalist stationed in Jerusalem, who has been covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for years. She prizes her professional detachment and shies away from anything that smacks of sentimentality. It is important to keep her emotions under wraps in both her writing and in her personal life. \\"Reflect the story; don't absorb it,\\" is her creed, \\"because if you allow yourself to feel the full force of sorrows and horrors, you will succumb to them.\\"<br /><br />On a trip to Lebanon for an important interview, Caddie's Land Rover is ambushed and her lover, Marcus, is killed. His death stuns her; shakes her to the core. She, who has covered so many battles, so much violence, finds herself musing at the many colors of a loved one's blood. Accustomed to holding her emotions in check, she doesn't know what to do with the onslaught of feelings that threaten to overpower her. For the first time that she can remember her reporter's gift of perfect recall is gone, as is her ability to be a cautious observer. She fears that after this life-altering event, she will never be \\"restored to even an accepted facsimile of what she was before.\\"<br /><br />Ordered back to New York for R&R by her editor, Caddie persuades him to let her remain longer in Jerusalem under the guise of writing a feature story on the \\"effects of violence.\\" Overwhelmed with rage, a need for revenge, survivor's guilt, (Would Marcus have accompanied her if she hadn't asked him to do the photography for her article?), Caddie searches for a response to the murder. She considers revenge, retaliation, among other possible solutions. Compelled to act, she needs to do something that will bring her peace and allow her to move on with her life. And she longs to write something to compensate for all the barriers which sometimes got in the way of her stories. \\"A piece that will show intimately how violence shreds sleep and appetite and memory, disfiguring those it leaves behind. A story that will get close enough to give violence a human face.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Hamilton brings her characters to life on these pages, especially Caddie. She is developed lovingly, and the changes she makes in the novel's 279 pages are intense and deeply felt. The novel's secondary characters are phenomenal, real originals - from interfering, gossipy Ya'el to Mr. Gruizin, who paints a red stripe on the mailbox of any out-of-town neighbor - to ensure their healthy return. There's mad Anya, who shouts and whispers her prophecies from street corners, Mrs. Weizman, always ready with her chicken soup to feed Caddie, and Goronsky, the man who suddenly enters Caddie's life and helps her define her ethical limits. The characters have one principal commonality - they have all been scarred and altered by violence.<br /><br />The author's vivid descriptions of Jerusalem brings that city to life. Her landscapes, images of light refracting against Jerusalem stone, the contradictory mix of the city`s inhabitants, the frenzy of everyday activity and the silence of Shabbat, evoke a timelessness and enrich the novel tremendously. This is a rare book - a real find.

A friend had been urging me for months to read Kelley Armstrong's \\"Bitten,\\" the first book in the \\"Women of the Otherworld\\" series.  She told me that the novel was well written and unusual, with a fresh take on the same old werewolf/shapeshifter tale. So I finally got around to reading the book and all I have to say is \\"WOW!\\" I can't think of one negative comment to make, not that I'd want to. I only have praise for this terrific read and for the author. The plot is excellent; the dialogue is at times serious, at others very funny, filled with dark humor. And it's all very believable - if you believe in werewolves, of course.<br /><br />Elena Michaels is a young, attractive, athletic journalist who lives in Toronto, Canada with her older lover, Philip, an architect. He is very serious about her and wants to marry her. Elena thinks she might care for him enough to marry him, except for one problem. Elena is a werewolf. As a matter of fact she is the only female werewolf...in the entire world. The werewolf gene has always been passed down from father to son - never to daughter. Almost all females bitten by werewolves have died before their bodies could adapt to the change. Elena's body adapted, which is more than can be said about her mind. She almost lost it for an entire year after her transformation. Then she finally accepted her fate. But she couldn't accept the betrayal, the bite, that made her other than human.<br /><br />Ms. Armstrong's werewolves live in packs. They do not kill human beings. Those who choose the life of a loner, eschewing the pack, are called mutts. They are not to be trusted because they can become very violent, unpredictable, and sometimes kill people, just for the love of the kill. Therefore a special pack, the one Elena belonged to, tracks and monitors the mutts, worldwide.<br /><br />Elena left her pack over a year before and is trying to make it on her own in the big city. However, the wild still calls to her and exerts a powerful pull. When a serious problem arises, Elena is called home to her pack's large forest estate in upstate New York, to assist them in their need. Then the real adventures, struggles and romance begin.<br /><br />Ms. Armstrong's characters are marvelous. Elena is a feminist and holds her own among the males. She gives as good as she gets. She is sassy, cynical, realistic, good in combat, but inside she's about as tough as a marshmallow. The other characters are every bit as strong and complex. Their lives and histories unfold as you read. And there's a wonderful sense of comaraderie and caring among the pack. After you finish the book, you will care about them too.

There are two fascinating protagonists with great mutual chemistry, interesting secondary characters, an intriguing plot and a bevy of subplots. Needless to say, I looked forward, with delight, to reading the rest of the book - only to be let down, cruelly. I just hate to be disappointed by a novel. I am an avid reader and pride myself on my ability to concentrate. However, Baldacci introduces so many characters of great import, and more of lesser standing, along with so many plots, subplots, potential plots and all sorts of motives, that I found it difficult to keep them all straight. And this book is far too long! I began to study the novel, actually taking notes, as if it were homework for a class in thermodynamics. Not fun! I just finished reading many positive reviews for \\"The Hour Game\\" and am beginning to wonder if I am the only one who was effected negatively. Although I am tempted to fudge a bit on the rating and go with the crowd, I have to call it as I see it. Reviewer's integrity and all that.<br /><br />Mr. Baldacci introduced us to two disgraced secret service agents in \\"Split Second,\\" Sean King and Michelle Maxwell. Since we last saw them, these two have changed careers and joined forces by becoming partners in a private investigation firm, King and Maxwell, located in small-town Wrightsburg, Virginia. This odd couple, of sorts, is what makes the novel work. Their combined energy, skills, intelligence and humor cannot be beat. King is a \\"neatnick,\\" everything-in-its-place type. He is a connoisseur of rich food and fine wine, and a steady rock when it comes to dependability. Michelle is a slob! Seriously. Her place is a mess and she is impulsive to boot. A super athlete and health food addict, there's nothing she likes more, (almost), than to row her boat many miles and return to a large spinach salad, multigrain bread and carrot juice. The two respect each other's differences because there's real affection between them. No romance yet...but there are possibilities. To add romantic tension, a former love of King's, the attractive medical examiner, Sylvia Diaz, is introduced - like we really needed another character.<br /><br />While out jogging Michelle discovers a dead body. The woman's corpse had been posed and a Zodiac watch, which didn't belong to her, was affixed to her wrist. The time was set to one o'clock. Was the killer trying to mimic the infamous Zodiac Killer? Murders #2 and 3 are of a young couple parked and necking at a favorite make-out site. The weapon - a shotgun. A dog collar was left on the floorboard of their car. Is this a Son of Sam copycat? Are the murders related and what is the message and motive? How are the corpses connected? The bizarre killings continue, each scene evoking aspects of former famous serial killers, and each death marked by a precise time. Police Chief Todd Williams deputizes King and Maxwell. The PIs make little sense of it all. There are too many potential suspects, (what are their names, again?), and a dearth of clues. See, I'm not the only one! Maxwell asks, \\"Why commit murders in similar styles to past killers as a copycat would and then write letters making it clear you're not them?\\"<br /><br />During this turmoil, attorney Harry Lee Carrick hires the two detectives to investigate a burglary, allegedly committed by his client, handyman Junior Deavor. The robbery took place on the estate of the town's wealthiest and most formidable family, the Battle clan - Southern gothic at its best. Is the entire family, and their history going back to the civil War, introduced to prop up the plot or to confuse the reader?<br /><br />Then the puzzles begin. Again, who is/are the killer(s)? Who stole what from whom? Motive(s)? How to keep all the characters straight? Who gets killed next? WillMichelle and Sean ever get together? And so on. I did enjoy some of the novel, especially the interaction and banter between King and Maxwell. The plot concerning the serial killer is interesting, as are some of the characters. Bottom line, if you're a Baldacci fan, you'll probably like this, even the confusing parts. Fans of the mystery, suspense thriller genre, who are patient readers, will also enjoy. As I wrote earlier, maybe it's just me! The one thing I do know is that this novel has potential and could have used a better editor.<br /><br />JANAxt? Will Michelle and Sean ever get together?

This novel is usually billed as BDSM erotica which really limits the readership. I find this sad because as a novel it is excellent and deserves to be enjoyed by a wider audience. While many potential readers will shy away from a novel with a BDSM theme, they certainly enjoy novels like \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" many novels by Stephen King, and suspense thrillers involving serial killers like Jack the Ripper. Although the latter books have little or no sexual content, they are usually much more violent in nature than this spellbinding mystery, suspense novel by Laura Reese. For those who are not familiar with the terminology, BDSM describes a number of related patterns of human sexual behavior. The major subgroupings are described in the acronym \\"BDSM\\" itself - bondage and discipline, domination and submission. The book's intriguing title, \\"Topping From Below,\\" refers to a rebellious dynamic in which the submissive, (the bottom), partner manipulates the dominant mate (the top).<br /><br />Nora Tibbs, an attractive, successful, 30-something journalist is obsessed with the mysterious murder of her younger sister Franny. Franny's decomposing body was found bound, gagged and mutilated on the floor of her living room. There was no evidence of breaking and entry, so it is speculated that the victim knew her killer and voluntarily allowed him/her to enter her home. The coroner, after the autopsy is completed, is unable to determined the cause of death.<br /><br />Nora is haunted by her sister's death and is determined to find the murderer. While looking through Franny's papers, she finds a diary on her sister's PC detailing the victim's BDSM relationship with a man called \\"M.\\" Always believing she knew her sister well, she is shocked that Franny would even consider entering an \\"abusive relationship.\\" The more she reads the more convinced she becomes that \\"M\\" committed the heinous act which ended her sister's life. The police have checked out this potential suspect, thoroughly investigated him, and found no evidence involving him in the case. The relationship between Franny and \\"M\\" was between two consenting adults, and the BDSM lifestyle is not a crime. Nora continues to believe \\"M\\" is guilty and is determined to prove it. She finds his home and work address and literally stalks \\"M,\\" a talented musician and music professor with very unusual sexual proclivities, (to say the least!), until finally the two meet. He knows from the beginning who Nora is, but is intrigued by her and the possibilities of forming a relationship with the sister of his former lover.<br /><br />From the very first page to the last sentence the suspense and the tension increase. The writing is superb and the three main characters, Nora, \\"M\\" and Franny are intriguing, well defined and developed. The conclusion is a knock-out! I really couldn't put this book down.<br /><br />I feel it necessary to warn potential readers that this book is for a mature audience. There are extremely graphic sex scenes, not all of them pleasant. However, none of the sexual material is gratuitous. All of it plays an important role in the plot and the development/decline of the characters. The novel could be compared, in a sense, to the \\"Story of O,\\" but the storyline is quite different.<br /><br />If you're intrigued but in doubt, check it out at a local bookstore. If you're just plain interested - go for it! Take a walk on the dark side. It is an excellent read!

I am not a big fan of the short story, unless the author is exceptionally good, but I really enjoyed the three stories/novellas Susie Bright has compiled in \\"Three The Hard Way.\\" Although all three pieces contain erotic elements, I think it does the material a disservice to classify it as erotica, or to limit these particular stories to the erotic genre, therefore discouraging those who would not select a book based on its erotic content. Given the graphic material which appears in much of today's fiction, especially romance and fantasy novels, I found these novellas to be erotic, sensual, but not over-the-top, and much more focused on characters, their development and plot. The sexual content is not gratuitous, but an integral part of the storylines. In other words, these are excellent, well written and well crafted novellas. Sex takes a back seat here, although it is integral to all three plots. The connecting theme is the idea that one sexual moment, or experience, can change a person forever.<br /><br />\\"The Motion of the Ocean\\" by Tsaurah Litsky is just plain terrific - and perhaps the rawest piece. It is funny, poignant, and a delightful read. However, of the three, it left me the most contemplative. Ms. Litsky writes of a young woman's coming of age, and takes her from her adolescence in the early 1960s, before the Sexual Revolution began, through the 1990s. The reader experiences the growth and changes of a spunky, yet vulnerable, heroine who absolutely captivates, while focusing on how the sexual mores have changed over the past half century. This is a beautifully crafted story with excellent descriptive passages and dialogue.<br /><br />Greg Boyd's \\"The Widow\\" takes an entirely different tone. A husband discovers pages from a secret novel his wife is writing - pages which she mistakenly left on their printer. The novel is about the sexual liberation of a recently widowed woman. The author's style is quite unique and I found this to be the most sensual and intriguing of the three.<br /><br />\\"Shadow of a Man,\\" by Emmy Award-winning writer William Harrison, is set in South Africa during the period before Nelson Mandela was released from prison. A worldly and somewhat jaded American photographer is commissioned to do a portrait of a famous general. He becomes deeply involved, over a brief period, with the general's daughter with unexpected consequences. The political undertones here had a tremendous impact on me.<br /><br />Overall, these are three novellas worthy of a wide readership. I say, \\"Bravo, Susie for compiling them.\\" Just a note - I use the terms short story and novella interchangeably. The editor makes a point of calling the three pieces \\"novellas\\" - I think they are too short and therefore fit into the \\"short story\\" category.<br /><br />JANAl and intriguing of the three. <br /> <br />\\"Shadow of a Man,\\" by Emmy Award-winning writer William Harrison, is set in South Africa during the period before Nelson Mandela was released from prison.

I have been looking forward to Ms. Shreve's latest offering, \\"Light On Snow,\\" and the author does not disappoint with this extremely moving character study. Her astute insight into the gamut of human emotions is demonstrated in this simple story of grief and redemption. Here, two people, a father and his adolescent daughter, crippled by tragic loss, seek a semblance of their past lives in a bizarre event they literally stumble into, which impacts them both profoundly.<br /><br />Nicky Dillon, now thirty, is the narrator. She reminisces back to the time she was twelve, living alone with her dad in an isolated house in the woods, just outside the town of Shepherd, NH. On a December day, near Christmastime, Robert Dillon's wife, Nicky's mother, and her baby sister, Clara, were killed in a car crash. Dillon chose Shepherd at random on his drive north with his remaining daughter, from their former home in Westchester, NY, because he could not drive on any longer. His goal was to remove himself as far as possible from society - to find a quiet place with no memories to bury his grief. Nicky, who was in terrible pain also, was faced with leaving the only home she had ever known, her friends and school, stability.<br /><br />Two years later, on a cold, wintery afternoon in mid-December, Nicky and her father go for their usual late afternoon walk in the forest. The snowfall is heavy enough to make snowshoes necessary. Deep in the woods they find a newborn infant, abandoned in the snow, lying in a sleeping bag. She is wrapped in a bloody towel, umbilical cord still attached. If they had arrived at the scene a little later, the baby girl would have froze to death. Racing to the hospital they are in time to save the child. Both father and daughter are questioned by a very shrewd detective, and the police begin a search for the parents who could be charged with attempted murder, child abandonment and cruelty. Nicky, who has had to mourn alone for two years, desperately wants the baby to live with them. She wants to learn about the mother and what made her abandon her child. How could a woman make such a terrible choice?<br /><br />There is a fascinating mystery here, but the novel's strength lies in the development of the characters. Twelve-year-old Nicky, on the cusp of young womanhood, is strong and very mature for her age. Perhaps it is the resilience of youth which gives her courage. She is the caretaker, the one who watches out for her father, a former architect who now takes solace in carpentry. Robert Dillon is narcissistic in his grief. By isolating himself, he forces isolation and loneliness on his daughter. Interspersed throughout the narrative are poignant memories of life with Nicky's mother and sister. Her mother will always remain young in Nicky's mind, while her sister grows up, just as she would if she were alive. At one point Nicky speaks of the small cast of characters with whom she frequently communicates - whose lives she remembers daily. \\"There are four of them in my little playlet: my mother who remains the same age she was when she died and who gives me bits of advice on how to handle my father; Clara, who is three and who is getting a Cabbage Patch doll for Christmas; Charlotte, who will do my hair and shop with me for clothes and be my friend; and also the Baby Doris, who might be having a bottle now. Or a nap.\\"<br /><br />There is an air of listlessness, hopelessness, throughout much of the novel. But this adds to the credibility. The mood lightens eventually as outside events force change. Ms Shreve's descriptions of small town New England, many of the novel's secondary characters, and the gorgeous frozen winter landscapes are rich and detailed. \\"Light On Snow\\" is different from Anita Shreve's other novels in that it is primarily character driven. It is a very good book and I do recommend it.<br /><br />JANAw\\" is different from Anita Shreve's other novels in that it is primarily character driven.

Our protagonist's life mirrors his country's changes and upheavals, from a feudal society to a monarchy and modernization with Reza Shah, and his son Mohammed Reza Shah, who founded the Pahlavi dynasty. The Pahlavis, autocratic nationalists, were determined to weaken the tribal khans while bringing their country into the 20th century, attempting to model Iran along Western lines. Increasing civil unrest led to the 1979 revolution, which brought about the downfall of the Shah, \\"King of Kings, Light of the World,' and birthed an Islamic theocracy.<br /><br />In the village of Madavan, \\"outside the township of Kamab, Iran, three hundred kilometers from the Fars provincial capital of Shiraz, on the tenth day of Teer, July 2, 1928,\\" Sarveali's mother died giving her only child life. The bizarre manner of his birth was inauspicious. He was left alone to be brought up by his father, Zofali, the Blind Licker. Zolfali was called so because, although unsighted, he possessed the unusual talent of ejecting his tongue and reaching it up to lick his own forehead. Zofali died when Sarveali was two-years-old, leaving him with his maternal aunt and uncle where he was trained as a shepherd. Barat-Ali, Zolfali's brother and Sarveali's self-appointed guardian, took possession of the boy when he turned six, and also took the goats and sheep the child inherited. Grasping, greedy Barat-Ali mistreated his charge, sodomized him and delivered him into indentured servitude in less than a year's time. From this moment, Sarveali dedicates his life to serving the Shirlu khans, an extremely wealthy family of landowners and farmers. He is appointed the servant of Teimor Khan, a beautiful, spoiled boy his own age, who he immediately adores. Although treated like the lowliest of slaves, Sarveali experiences a better life than he has ever known. He has enough food to fill his stomach, a warm bed and a change of clothes, an occasional friend and a young master to adore.<br /><br />The reader is told the history of modern Iran through episodes in Serveali's life. With the Shah's reforms and land distribution, the khans are eventually transformed from rich, powerful rulers to poor exiles. Members of the Shirlu family are assassinated. During these crucial events in the family's and the nation's history, Sarveali experiences his own major adventures and changes. Through Barat-Ali's machinations, he is forced into marriage with disastrous results. He discovers the delights and downside of opium addiction and spends some time in jail. He also experiences what he believes to be a lifelong physical malady. He thinks he can be cured by a traditional quince seed potion passed on to him by the beloved Bibi Golnar Khanom, the Great Khan's wife. Through everything he remains subservient, servile and extremely loyal to the Shirlus, who are the only family he has every known.<br /><br />I was extremely eager to read \\"The Quince Seed Potion\\" having lived in Iran for a few years a long time ago and maintained my interest in the country, the Iranian people and their wonderful culture. There is much that I like about the novel, its characters, episodic adventures and the incorporation of the historical into the storyline. On the other hand the prose is uneven; it doesn't flow. There is a raunchy quality, a bawdiness, to the narrative which I would have enjoyed more, but the language in these spicier sections seems to be translated literally from the Farsi into English, and is more awkward than effective. Ultimately, I don't believe that Sarveali's life of poverty and servitude is meaningless or tragic. There are certainly many worthwhile moments that he experiences. A far greater tragedy would benot to have lived at all. A philosophical question the reader can mull over after completing this interesting and very different novel of modern Persia.<br /><br />JANAwould be not to have lived at all.

Author John Douglas, a veteran of the FBI and expert in personality profiling, demonstrates his years of experience and storytelling ability in this vivid investigative analysis of the first Internet serial killer, John Robinson. Douglas, and his co-author Stephen Singular, meticulously describe Robinson's journey from a seemingly harmless white collar criminal to an obvious psychopath, who exploited the Internet's world of single women seeking love and relationships, with deadly results.  A married father of four, a seemingly good citizen, active in his church and community, Robinson was able to hide his evil nature and schemes from his wife, a woman who lived in a state of absolute denial, and from others who knew him best.<br /><br />Fortunately, he was unable to fool Steve Haymes, a parole officer in Liberty, Missouri, who had been on Robinson's trail for fifteen years before his suspicions and persistent investigation panned out. Haymes was the only person who kept a record of Robinson's evolution through the criminal justice system. During a thirty-five year period, he examined his criminal patterns, his range of activities and attempted to penetrate the man's personality. Robinson had been arrested numerous times for fraud and theft, but was able to use his charm and cunning to elude more serious charges. It was during these early days in Robinson's criminal career that he appeared on Haymes' radar screen. In early 1985 Parole Officer Haymes imagined what the law enforcement community was confronting. In March 2000, he discovered that he had been correct in his initial assessment, with results much more disastrous than he had ever contemplated.<br /><br />Chubby, balding, unattractive, Robinson, was intelligent, innovative and entrepreneurial enough to be in the forefront of the consumer vanguard, employing the new personal computer technology to his advantage. Cybercrime had yet to be defined when Robinson saw the possibilities in using the Internet to make easy money and gratify his particular needs and longings. Ultimately, he discovered the world of sadomasochistic Website chat rooms, where he was able to charm and reassure the vulnerable, lonely women who frequented them. It was on the Net that he was able to stalk his victims and lure them to meet him in person -  never to be seen or heard from again.<br /><br />I don't read much True Crime but was fascinated by this case of deadly cybercrime. I use the Internet frequently and know people who have met online and married - although they never frequented sadomasochistic chatrooms. Still, reading \\"Anyone You Want Me To Be\\" was an educational experience as well as a riveting read.

Gus Weill perfectly captures the Cajun culture, rich as a delicious gumbo, the musical patois, and the extraordinarily eccentric characters of Louisiana's backwater Richelieu Parish in 1956, where rampant political corruption and petty theft is a way of life. This is a town where the locals look-up to those who cheat successfully. Author Weill examines the resemblance of this tiny town to a large dysfunctional family, which somehow manages to get through life's tribulations with a little help from each other - in spite of themselves.<br /><br />State Senator Papoot Gaspard, a local, has become a legend in his own time. He could have invented the concept of graft. His daughter Bebe, once beautiful, now obese, is a simple, loving woman married to town sheriff, Bobby Boudreaux. She eats uncontrollably to calm her libido. Bobby doesn't get turned-on by fat women. In a town of devout Catholics, Papoot's son, Father Justin, is the most righteous. Mayor Big Head Arceneaux; wealthy Big Shot Fontenot and his father, Li'l Shot; powerful lawyer Hurphy Perrault who has a club foot which no one notices because he is so rich; Bad A-s (sorry censorship rules!) Thibodeaux, the town drunk; Catfish Francois, cook extraordinaire; Possum Aucoin, the town barber who presides over all important parish business; One Lung Savoy, poolroom doyen; gas station owner President Prejean, (yes his 1st name is President), a man with definite political ambition; Misty, the local Madame and her business partner, Ballou Sinistere; local DJ NaNa Duhon and his ever present papoon, Lucky, also populate the novel. \\"The Cajuns\\" is worth reading just to bone up on the antics of these characters.<br /><br />\\"The Cajuns\\" is more than a character and cultural study of life in rural Louisiana, mid-20th century, however. With all its humor and satire, this is a mystery and a poignant, moving drama. Former resident and New Orleans newspaper reporter Ruth Ann Daigle comes home to Richelieu to care for her dying father, owner of the local paper. She is super smart, sexy and sophisticated - so she sure stands out in Richelieu. Ruth Ann has never been one to mind her own business, which is why she excels as a reporter. She manages to vex her fellow citizens, soon after her arrival, by persistently inquiring into the supposedly accidental death of a local teen. Sheriff Boudreaux, who could be called the town's conscience, is at first resentful of Ruth Ann's continuous questioning. Then he becomes interested in joining her, in spite of his fear of alienating his powerbroker father-in-law. Long repressed feelings and urges ignite between the two as their investigation progresses.<br /><br />Although the novel's pace plods at times, especially in the beginning, the characters are fascinating, funny and occasionally tragic. The mystery and conflicts are quite timely and relevant, over fifty years after the action takes place. I am glad I stuck with the book. It is worth it. Recommended!<br />JANAhe local paper.

As a Manhattanite, the World Trade Center's twin towers used to be my New York City lodestone. With my lousy sense of direction, I always knew where I was by marking my location in relation to the two buildings, soaring skyward, so visible above everything else. Even now, three years after 9/11, I sometimes forget and look towards the southwest, expecting to see the buildings' lights. For days, weeks, months after September 11, I saw, in my minds eye, almost exactly the same image portrayed on the cover of \\"In The Shadow Of No Towers\\" - darkest black shadows of the two landmarks against a night sky - emptiness during the daylight. There is no more eloquent description to mark absence, to recall violence and infamy, than the cover picture of these two shadows.<br /><br />Mr. Spiegelman is best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning book \\"Maus,\\" where he used the medium of comic strips to portray the Holocaust, his parents' experience as survivors of Auschwitz, and his own experience as a child of Holocaust victims. Ironically, his parents taught him at an early age to \\"always keep my bags packed.\\" He writes in the book's Introduction, an extraordinary essay, \\"I tend to be easily unhinged. Minor mishaps - a clogged drain, running late for an appointment - send me into a sky-is-falling tizzy. It's a trait that leaves one ill-equipped for coping when the sky actually falls.\\" And the sky literally fell on the author and his family that day. They lived in the towers' shadow, in TriBeca, and their daughter was in school that morning - a school located at Ground Zero - a tizzy producing experience if there ever was one!!<br /><br />This unusual hybrid book, 42 oversized pages printed on heavy card stock, is a combination of comic book illustrations and prose. It is an extremely personal memoir of the attacks on the WTC, which Spiegelman and his family witnessed at close range. It is a raving rant about the after effects of the violence and its repercussions throughout the world at large, and the smaller interior world of the author's psyche. It is the intimate story of one family trying to cope. It is an editorial about the political exploitation of this terrible event. The book is designed to be read vertically, just like the old comic strip broadsheets that appeared in newspapers. Each strip is a story, ten of them, followed by a comic supplement.<br /><br />An image, seemingly burned into Spiegelman's eyelids, is the last sight he had of the North Tower just before it fell. He saw the building's skeleton, its very bones, lit up and glowing right before it vaporized. This image reoccurs throughout the book.<br /><br />The country, the world, has seemingly become inured to the unthinkable, just three years later. The further away one lives from Ground Zero, the more removed the event. Art Spiegelman has given us a strange gift with his book - an honest memory of a devastating tragedy - a memory that depicts humor as well as horror, confusion, terror and heartbreak. All of us must move on, move forward. Oddly enough, Spiegelman's book helps us to do so by chronicling 09/11/01 and its aftermath, allowing us to let its vividness go. \\"Still time keeps flying and even the New normal gets old.\\" \\"...though three years later I am still ready to lose it all at the mere drop of a hat or a dirty bomb. I still believe the world is ending, but I concede that it seems to be ending more slowly than I once thought...so I figured I'd write this book.\\"<br /><br />A beautiful book worth reading, worth keeping.<br />JANAant about the after effects of the violence and its repercussions throughout the world at large, and the smaller interior world of the author's psyche.

I was disappointed with David Baldacci's \\"Split Second.\\" Unlike his previous works it is definitely not a strong, tightly written novel, although it could have been a real winner. Throughout much of the book, the thrills, adventure and mystery are certainly present and do keep the reader turning the pages. The three main characters are interesting, unusual and well developed. So, what's wrong? The second half of the novel falls apart. The pace slows; the tension diminishes; the characters begin to act out of character, and turn into cardboard figures without much rationale for their actions. The villain, who has such potential to be a really bad guy, is totally one-dimensional - pure evil incarnate with no complexity, more like a cartoon than a human being. There's a fascinating love triangle which should have taken-off - but falls flat. And after the terrific opening and much of the first half, the conclusion is weak. The book ends with a peep, not a bang!<br /><br />Sean King, Secret Service agent extraordinaire, with great career potential, is guarding a presidential candidate on a campaign stop in Smalltown USA. King's attention is diverted for one instant, and good cause, when the candidate, Clyde Ritter, is shot dead. Agent King recovers his composure immediately and shoots the assassin. The killer dies. So does King's career.<br /><br />Eight years later Secret Service agent and girl wonder Michelle Maxwell is on a career fast track in a profession where only men succeed. Agent Maxwell, a former Olympic rower, is the exception to the rule. She has her sights set on White House duty guarding the president and she just might get the gig. She is presently guarding a presidential candidate, John Bruno, who is making an unscheduled stop at a funeral home to pay his respects to the deceased. The room is vacated except for the candidate, the corpse and the widow. Bruno insists on time alone, without security. Uncomfortable with the candidate's decision, Maxwell, and fellow agents stand outside the closed door, 99% sure their charge will be safe. He is kidnapped right out from under their noses. Michelle may still have a job, but her career is over. She is determined, however, to find John Bruno before he is killed - if indeed, he is still alive.<br /><br />Former agent King is now living in a house he designed and built on a quiet lakefront in Virginia. He went back to school for a law degree and shares a practice in town. Sean reads of agent Maxwell's fall from grace and feels great empathy because of his similar experience. His empathy chills considerably when Ms. Maxwell shows up at his door with some questions and a theory that the murder and the kidnapping, eight years apart, just may be related. She provides some convincing arguments, and it doesn't hurt that King is wildly attracted to her, so he considers the ramifications of working with Michelle on the case. Then he finds a body, dead, in his law office. Just about this time, an old flame and colleague of King's, Joan Dillenger, turns up, apparently on-the-make. They haven't seen each other in eight years. She was with him the day before the assassination and stayed with him that night in his hotel room, leaving her black lace panties on the ceiling light fixture for the maid to remove the following morning.<br /><br />Joan, Michelle and Sean combine their considerable resources to solve this mystery which just keeps getting more complicated - and interesting. But there is someone out there, in the background, with even more resources, who is playing them all with extraordinary expertise.<br /><br />Given my above comments, if you are a Baldacci fan, then the book is certainly worth reading.

Merinus Tyler is a talented journalist, a real professional who always gets her story. That is, she gets the story when her overprotective father and six feisty, interfering brothers aren't hampering her, insisting she stay out of trouble and away from dangerous situations. But dangerous situations make excellent copy. Merinus works for the National Forum, where her oldest brother Caleb is editor-in-chief, and she is obsessed with a lead on a potential story. She had seen a photograph of a man, Callan Lyons, who was the product of a genetic experiment. He had been conceived in a test tube, carried to term by a surrogate mother, Dr. Maria Morales, inheriting the genes of the animal his DNA had been altered with - a lion. He looks like a normal man, has the feelings of a man, but has all the instincts and hunting abilities of a lion. He was bred to be a killer; an almost perfect weapon to be used by the military. Dr. Morales had been a very close friend of John Tyler, Marinus' father. After Morales' recent death, a murder, all her papers, including the genetic project's documentation on breeding, were sent to Tyler, at her bequest. Reading these papers, Merinus saw a photograph of Lyons and couldn't get his face out of her mind. She desperately wanted to meet him, ostensibly to learn about his life, and to persuade him to come forward to testify against the secret Genetics Council, which had conducted so many illegal experiments and caused so much suffering. Kane Tyler, one of Merinus' brothers, an ex-Special Forces commander, finally agrees to accompany his sister, doubting very much if she will get her interview with the reclusive Lyons.<br /><br />But Merinus succeeds. You doubted? Callan is handsomer, more charismatic and mysterious in person than in his photograph. He lives, with his Pride, other genetically altered humans known as feline breeds, in an inaccessible, hidden sanctuary. The military and the Council would pay any price to capture Callan's group. When the breeds escaped from the secret laboratory they took with them the physical results of years of experimentation. Also, if word leaked that these creatures existed, their creators would be tried for criminal acts.<br /><br />When Merinus and Callan meet they have an overpowering physical effect on each other - a chemical effect that had never been witnessed during all the years at the laboratory. Emotional ties begin to form between the two also. With evil members of the Genetics Council pursuing them, as well as Merinus' family, a betrayal from inside the Pride, and a truly uncontrollable physical attraction, there is plenty of plot in this most erotic novel - as well as scenes that absolutely sizzle.<br /><br />Lora Leigh has written with \\"Tempting the Beast: Feline Breeds 1,\\" probably the steamiest novel I have ever read. And the author writes well. She has talent. Her characters are well defined and very sympathetic, and her imagination is amazing.

Eating rabbit food everyday, no pizza, and doing breathing exercises with a motley group of dorks, (not to sound snobby, but these people are real nerds, trust me!), the two friends can't wait to leave. So they are astonished into speechlessness when on the day of departure, Kyra is kidnapped by a 7-foot tall warrior, built like Arnold Schwartzeneggar when he was still pumping iron.

He manages to frighten her into shock, when, without touching her, he rips off all her clothes.

Kyra is immediately put to sleep, to avoid trouble on the return trip, and when she awakens, Zor begins to discuss the features and culture of her new, male dominated world. Oh, there is much to accustom herself to on Zor's hedonistic planet, where few (Earthly) inhibitions exist.<br /><br />Jaid Black has filled her novel with wonderful humor and romance, as well as super steamy erotic scenes.

Most people, at one time or another, fantasize about having three wishes granted to them - perhaps by a genie who emerges from a bottle or lantern. Isis Montgomery, a lovely, down-on-her luck lady who believes in magic, is seeking a unique formula to make a very special perfume. Her grandmother had worn this particular scent. She called it \\"Magic\\" and told her young granddaughter that the recipe was a family legacy. The scent changes to adapt to each individual who comes in contact with it - making it one-of-a-kind - conjuring up everyone's personal paradise. She never smelled it again after her grandmother died, years before. Isis owns an aromatherapy and perfume shop - her 2nd business. Due to a ruthless, conniving ex-fiance, who happened to be her business partner, her first venture had gone bad. The man spread rumors about Isis practicing magic and managed to walk away with every one of her precious formulas, patents and all. Her family was now financing her on this second endeavor, and she was determined to make her business a success and pay them back.<br /><br />On the way home from work one day, walking through the French Quarter of New Orleans, her hometown, Isis sees a tiny shop on a side street whose sign read - \\"Madame Paris, Curiosities, Dreams, and Magic.\\" As she stops to look inside, she catches a whiff on the breeze of the exotic scent she has been searching for. Sure enough, inside the old store she finds a flask with just a few drops of the perfume left. She desperately wants the remnants to discover the individual ingredients, and produce the perfume for her own business. Unfortunately, the shop owner, Madame Paris, is reluctant to sell it unless she receives a very bizarre price - $100. down, and a request to be fulfilled at a later date by Isis, along with another $100. Isis is to conjure up a djinni and bind him to her, using Mme. Paris' spell, chants and all. The djinni will then grant her three requests.<br /><br />And she does indeed conjure up a Djinn - Dariyavius el Zarasteya, from the planet of Kaf, where he is known as The Protector.

I saw \\"The Great Pretender\\" listed on Amazon.com, read the wonderful reviews and ordered it ASAP. I was terribly disappointed, especially given all the hoopla surrounding this novel, Millenia Black's first. My main problem is that in the entire cast of characters I cannot find one that I like. There is not one single fictional person I can relate to, or sympathize with, in the book's 303 pages. The storyline of a man, or woman, with a double life has so much potential. But all the folks involved in this \\"double life\\" scenario are totally self-centered - they're just plain shallow and, well, despicable.<br /><br />Reginald Brooks, a marketing executive, has traveled every two weeks, for six years, from Miami, Florida to Orlando, Florida and back again to Miami. Fortunately he has a job that allows him to do this. Reginald is married to Tracy, with whom he has two children. Olivia is the eldest, who dislikes her father intensely because of his perpetual neglect, and Valerie, age 17, is a chronic snoop, who spies on everyone. Then there's Renee Jameson, Reggie's gorgeous trophy girlfriend, with a great body, who lives in Orlando with their daughter Denise. Renee believes that her man is single and that they will marry soon. Neither woman knows about the other family. However, Reg is getting tired of the commute. He wants to make a choice between families and live in just one city with one woman, one family. Middle age is really getting to him and he's tired of the travel, the airports, the planes, etc.. He will just have to dump someone. He loves Tracy but wants to raise Denise, since he missed child rearing with his first two daughters. Such problems! Such a decision!<br /><br />Franklin Bevins is Reggie's best friend, the only person he confides in and depends on. Frank and Tracy Brooks, (Reggie's wife), are sleeping together, and have been lovers for some time. Frank has always been very jealous of Reg.<br /><br />You can imagine all the convolutions the plot takes, more than a French farce, but with a sorry ending. It's all about folly and consequences. As I said before, I was just not able to relate to the characters. They were more like caricatures than three dimensional individuals. Ms. Black's writing is uneven, but I did stick with the novel enough to enjoy it sometimes, which is why the 3 star rating instead of 2. When I begin a book I rarely give up. This may be a bad habit, who knows?<br /><br />In all honesty, I cannot recommend this novel. But if you are curious, check it out in your local bookstore before you make the purchase.

I'll admit it. I'm a girly-girl. War, fighting, killing, wounding, battles, tactics, strategy, weapons - these things do not turn me on. I'd rather have my nails done. I do live in Manhattan, however, so my interests and priorities changed on 9/11, to put it mildly. But, I still could never picture myself reading nonfiction about war - novels like \\"From Here To Eternity,\\" Norman Mailer's \\"The Naked and the Dead,\\" and \\"The Thin Red Line,\\" of course, but not a firsthand account of war from a soldier's point of view.<br /><br />The other day I was watching one of my favorite TV programs, C-SPAN's Book TV, and was fortunate to hear, (and see), Captain Andrew Exum, the author of \\"This Man's Army,\\" discuss his book and answer questions from the audience. I was riveted by the recounting of his experiences in Afghanistan and Kuwait, and by his thoughtful, serious points of view on the current political and military situations. He really impressed me. (Unlike war, I am into politics). I was fascinated and wanted to read his book. So I bought it that afternoon and read it in a day and a half. It's that good!<br /><br />Exum was an active-day army officer whose identity was not disclosed until this book was published. He is certainly not a war correspondent, so I cannot compare his writing to Seymour Hersh's or John Burns'. However, as he points out, he is in a position to give the reader a unique perspective of war on the ground, part of the story of combating the War on Terrorism, and this is what makes his book so fresh and interesting. He was a participant, responsible for getting men to do their jobs effectively and efficiently, and for returning them safely home. Captain Exum, is able to tell why he, a man of privilege, educated at the best schools, risked everything to become an Army Ranger in a time of great danger. He was there from the beginning to the end of an experience, from planning to execution to the aftermath. He does intersperse his narrative with references to Shakespeare, Graham Greene, Walker Percy, Don DeLillo, etc., which enriches the book even more.<br /><br />From his early ROTCE beginnings, to various Army training programs culminating in the rigorous Ranger program, the hurry-up and wait period of his initial deployment, to the struggles in Afghanistan's Shah-e-Kot Valley with the 10th Mountain Division, this 25-year-old officer, (a Lieutenant at the time), details his life and missions as a 21st century warrior. A member of one of the 1st units to deploy to Kuwait, less than a month after September 11, 2001, he began his tour of duty by supervising escort convoys. Then, he was sent to Afghanistan, where other members of the 10th Mountain Division took heavy casualties. He takes the reader with him to the field of battle and the fight against bin Ladin's al Qaeda recruits. In one instance he faced, fought and killed one of these terrorists. His platoon, the top-rated unit in the battalion, went on missions to recover sensitive equipment and destroy enemy caches. There are light moments also. I cracked-up at his account of a discussion with a Navy SEAL about Nabokov's \\"Lolita.\\" And he also discusses his not-so-easy childhood, growing up in Chattanooga, Tennessee.<br /><br />The book ends with his return to the US, the difficulties of readjusting to life in the civilian world and his reaction to the media's distortions of the war and his experience. His thoughts and memories of war, and those who fight wars, are much with him. There were periods when I was deeply moved...and then there were the super macho parts, which I think are fun!<br /><br />In a time of great troubles, Andrew Exum has given me a better understanding of life on the ground, and in battle, for the men and women whose job is to defend America. \\"This Man's Army: A Soldier's Story from the Front Lines of the War on Terrorism\\" is excellent - a must read!<br /><br />JANAferences to Shakespeare, Graham Greene, Walker Percy, Don DeLillo, etc., which enriches the book even more. <br /> <br />From his early ROTCE beginnings, to various Army training programs culminating in the rigorous Ranger program, the hurry-up and wait period of his initial deployment, to the struggles in Afghanistan's Shah-e-Kot Valley with the 10th Mountain Division, this 25-year-old officer, (a Lieutenant at the time), details his life and missions as a 21st century warrior.

La Habana, Cuba, 1982 - Fidel Castro has led Cuba's Communist Revolution for 23 years. Ronald Reagan has been the US President for just over a year. Approximately 125,000 Cubans emigrated to the US 20 months before, in the Mariel boatlift. The international community is still immersed in the Cold War. However, the reader's focus is drawn to a narrower world, that of Lourdes, a Havana 16-year-old. She is in the terrible throws of adolescence - raging hormones, insecurity, anxiety, confusion. Her skin is too dark, she is too skinny, her hair is too frizzy and she will never attract a cool boyfriend. In order to maintain a mature outlook on her turbulent life, and focus on what is really important to the community, not just herself, she tries to live-up to the revolutionary standards of her hero, Che Guevera. An idealist, Lourdes fervently believes socialism makes a better life for all, and thinks no one is oppressed under Fidel's leadership.<br /><br />Lourdes Torres comes from a privileged family. Her father, Dr. Rafael Torres, is a respected professor of Political Economy of Communism at the University of Havana and a Caucasian, of certified Spanish descent. Although revolutionary Cuba has done much to eliminate racism, it is still rampant throughout the country. Before the revolution, there was virtual segregation, and although the situation has improved, and all have equal rights, the color of one's skin still matters. White is best. Then light brown, \\"cafe con mucho leche,\\" and on down the color scale until it reaches darkest brown or \\"black.\\" There are all kinds of combinations and permutations and subtleties, which I won't go into here. The point is that skin color does matter.<br /><br />Because of her father's position, Lourdes leads a sheltered life. The family is allowed to shop in special stores, go on occasional vacations to beach resorts and stay for a week at a hotel, eating all kinds of food - as much as they want. They live in a nice house, (una casona), in the Havana suburbs, and even have the option of buying a new car. Lourdes' paternal grandmother, Granma Gloria, from Galicia, Spain, was a lady before the revolution and still maintains certain airs. She adores her son and granddaughter, but has little affection for her dark-skinned daughter-in-law. Barbarita, Lourdes mother, is the daughter of a poor black woman, Granma Ines, who practices Santeria, an ancient African religion where the old gods, \\"orishas,\\" are still worshipped in the form of Catholic saints. Both grandmothers' religions, Catholicism and Santeria are counterrevolutionary and not practiced in the open. Lourdes is conflicted about this, and other differences between the old ways and the new. She does strive, with intensity, to be a good revolutionary, like Che, and longs to be accepted into the Young Communist League.<br /><br />She is sent, along with her classmates, to a state-run work-study program in Pinar del Rio, called School-in the Field, to work in tobacco fields. For the first time, Lourdes, an only child, is exposed to large numbers of kids her own age, boys and girls, in a live-in situation. And she learns much more about life than tobacco cultivation. She compares revolutionary slogans she always believed, (\\"Man Is More Than White; More Than Mulatto; More Than Black! Men Die But The Party Is Immortal! Homeland Or Death!\\"), to real life in the real world. Her romantic idealism is contrasted with the grim reality of the hot sun beating down on her aching back, bug bites, not enough food and long hours at monotonous work. She begins to see the flaws in her perfect society, flaws not unique to life under capitalism.<br /><br />Teresa de la Caridad Doval, born and raised in Havana, now a resident of New Mexico, really gives the reader an accurate glimpse of life in Cuba in the early 1980s. At that time I visited Cuba on business and her descriptions and characterizations ring true. The prose is uneven and the novel's pace has its slowmoments, but overall I enjoyed the story. I would recommend \\"A Girl Like Che Guevara,\\" especially if you are interested in life in revolutionary Cuba.<br /><br />JANAits slow moments, but overall I enjoyed the story.

The images - paintings, prints and pastels - accompany short rhymes about a baby's daily activities, such as drinking milk, napping, feeding ducks and hugging.<br /><br />William Lach wrote the book, and the illustrations are from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, collection. There are 16 pages of paintings, each with its own description. In one picture a mother and child are cuddling with the words, \\"Baby cuddles.\\" The simple, easy to understand language and powerful artwork make this an ideal book for small children.

I am including this information because not only does \\"The Good Earth\\" provide a wonderful reading experience, but it has been recognized worldwide as a novel that has had an impact on everyone who reads it. And it continues to do so. \\"The Good Earth\\" is a true modern classic. Ms. Buck depicts life in China during the reign of the last Emperor. It is the period before enormous political and social change would transform an agrarian society into a technological world power. Pearl Buck lived in China for most of her life and her familiarity with the people and culture is evident in her writing.<br /><br />Wang Lung is a simple peasant, a poor man. And he is a man of many complexities, demonstrated by the way he interacts with his family - his wife, children, elderly father, and with those who live in his village. It is also the story of the Chinese peasants' deep and abiding love of the earth; their strong attachment to the land, and to traditional Chinese values.<br /><br />The author takes us through Wang Lung's life, from his youth when he seeks a wife, to his marriage, and the good years when his land brings forth relative abundance and his wife bears him many children. Then come the years of famine and abject poverty. It is Wang Lung's strength of character, and his refusal to give up his land, that carries his family through to better times. And then history intervenes.<br /><br />The author develops her characters so realistically that they come to life on the page. Wang Lung, his wife O-Lan, his sons, the concubine Lotus Flower, the evil uncle and cousins - all have their stories, their individual motives, and their manner of action and reaction as the changing times impact their lives.

Ella is distracted by the familiar face of an innocuous looking man, sitting a few tables away. She is sure she recognizes him from their stops in both Rome and Florence. Now in Montecatini, not exactly a booming tourist center, the young couple sees the stranger again. Could this be a coincidence? Suddenly the man becomes agitated, stands, stares directly at Ella, reaches under his jacket and pulls out a gun. Ella is paralyzed with fear as the gunman walks directly toward her, and turns to face the street, shielding her from passersby. She hears gunshots. Two men in the crowd fall to the pavement and a third is about to go down. While a fast-forming crowd mills around the bodies, the stranger grabs Ella's arm and orders the couple to follow him. He threatens to kill them if they don't obey. As the three drive away from the crime scene, the stranger introduces himself. \\"Probably an attempted kidnap,\\" he says. \\"I'm Lucas. Mark Hatto, (Ella's father), asked me to watch Ella in case of something like this.\\" Life, as the bright, innocent Ella knows it, goes downhill from this moment. Attempting to evade further \\"problems\\" until arrangements can be made to fly Ella and Chris home, they arrive in Milan where they learn horrific news concerning the Hatto family - news which will forever change Ella's life and irrevocably alter the very core of her being.<br /><br />\\"For The Dogs\\" starts off with a Bang, (literally), and the momentum just doesn't slow down, not even on the last page. From the powerful, action-packed opening, the reader is hooked by this taut psychological, suspense thriller. Author Kevin Wignall's narrative moves along at a brisk pace toward climatic events that will leave you spellbound...and chilled. My favorite scenes are between Lucas and Ella. Stephen Lucas is one of the most romantic, endearing, cold-blooded contract killers I have met in fiction. He is quite the literary maven, and his love of books is a trait he shares with Ella. Lucas is reading \\"The Nibelungenlied\\" when they meet; Ella is into Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion.\\" The author did not choose these book at random. \\"For The Dogs\\" has something of both the German epic and the English novel in its storyline. The unlikely pair of Lucas and Ella, solitary hit-man and extroverted college girl, form an intense, unusual bond based on their own individual needs and fantasies. She gets a glimpse of his world and wants in. He is trying to get out. He seeks redemption. She is driven by an obsessive need for justice and revenge.<br /><br />The book's secondary characters are interesting and quirky, but this story really belongs to Ella and Lucas. The author develops their characters beautifully, and explores their deep and dark sides, as well as classically romantic elements.<br /><br />This is a gritty novel about fate, tragic loss and retribution. It is also about reconciliation, renewal and forgiveness. Wignall succeeds in  revealing the consequences of removing the human face from violence and death. \\"For The Dogs\\" is a terrific read anyway you look at it.

Bush's First Term In Office!	Editor-in-chief of Vanity Fair, Graydon Carter, has written some excellent columns and letters for his magazine over the years, and for some time now has been expressing his concern with where the Bush administration has been leading America. In \\"What We've Lost,\\" Mr. Carter consolidates his grievances against the Bush administration - documenting the ways, he believes, the present government has weakened our democratic process. Listed, and the book is long on lists, are the names, dates, numbers and details of American losses due to President Bush and his colleagues' zeal to further their political agenda.<br /><br />Carter cites national and international policy failures as a result of President Bush's 1st term in office: the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent, seemingly never-ending war; personal rights; woman's rights; the economy; the environment; the accumulation of a huge deficit, including pork barrel spending; jobs; the respect of old allies and the international community, etc., etc. The author claims that it would be difficult \\"to point to a single element of American society that comes under federal jurisdiction that is not worse off now than it was an administration ago, from civil liberties to the economy, foreign affairs to the environment.\\" All that is alleged is documented here with facts and anecdotes. Each chapter opens with a statement by the President in \\"Bushspeak,\\" i.e., \\"I'm the commander - see, I don't need to explain - I don't need to explain why I say things. That's the interesting thing about being president. Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something, but I don't feel like I owe anybody an explanation\\" - George W Bush, (August 2002); and \\"It's clearly a budget. Its got lots of numbers in it.\\" It all boggles the mind!<br /><br />The author apparently researched thousands of reports and documents for his book - one of the many \\"Bush Bashers\\" to be published this year. Although those in G. W.'s administration surely have explanations and rationales about how all that is cited as major losses are really \\"wins,\\" Mr Carter wonders if the President really believes his own spinners' spin. For example, he questions how Bush can institute a tax system that clearly benefits a minute percentage of extremely wealthy people and does so little for the middle class.<br /><br />This is obviously not a work by a political pundit, but it is an impassioned argument by a fellow American citizen against reelecting the President to a second term of office.<br /><br />Although this is not my favorite political book of the year, I did enjoy it, (if \\"enjoy\\" can be employed here), and found it to be quite informative and disturbing. I think folks should read through parts of this at their local bookstores, if they don't want to purchase it.

This novel stands on its own, however, and it is not necessary to read the first book in order to appreciate this one. I think the plot and pacing are much better in \\"Mind Game\\" than in the former novel, however, and the characters are more fully developed.<br /><br />A deceased scientist, Dr. Peter Whitney, had experimented on a group of gifted orphaned children decades before the story begins, in order to enhance their psychic abilities. While part of the experiment worked and the children's abilities were increased, the doctor was unable to control and utilize their talents. The children were all left psychologically deformed. They do not have the defenses, or shields, normal people do to protect themselves from sensory overload. This overload causes terrible headaches, inability to concentrate and sometimes severe seizures. When Whitney saw that his experiments were not proceeding in the direction he planned, he asked for military volunteers, disciplined officers from the special forces, and attempted the same experiments with the same results. These military psychics became known as GhostWalkers because they were eventually caged, no longer considered human, and were forced to escape and live in the shadows. Whitney's adopted daughter, Lily, one of the children used in the experiments, discovers her father's military victims. She moves them into a mansion which has been overhauled to provide the men with protective facilities, where they can live and train to immunize themselves against this sensory overload.<br /><br />In Lily's search to find the children she grew up with, she discovers that one of her dearest friends, Dahlia LeBlanc, has been living a hermit's existence in a secluded residence in the Louisiana bayou country. Dahlia works for a US government intelligence agency, where she retrieves stolen, top secret technologies and information.

She does a terrific job with \\"White Rain.\\" I just couldn't put this novel down and must have read it in two sittings. The story is fresh, very original, although there is much fiction about \\"shapeshifters\\" on the market today. Her main characters, Rachael and Rio, are fleshed-out well, very believable and the chemistry between them sizzles. The secondary characters, Kim Pang, other natives and their culture, the shaman, even the pet clouded leopards Fritz and Franz, are fascinating.<br /><br />Rachael Lospostos seeks sanctuary from ruthless assassins in a relatively uninhabited rainforest in Indochina. She makes the trip in the guise of a volunteer, transporting medical supplies, by boat, to remote areas in the region. During an ambush by bandits, Rachael slips overboard and fakes her own death. She thinks she will be able to elude the deadly killers if they no longer believe she is alive. Rachael has excellent survival training and wants to live alone...safely, without constant fear. From the moment she enters the rainforest she feels more alive than ever before. Neither jungle heat, humidity nor mosquitoes bother her. In fact she seems to thrive in the atmosphere. During a particularly bad downpour, she seeks shelter in what she believes is an abandoned tribal hut set deep in the foliage. Drowsy after the long hike inland, Rachael falls asleep and awakens to an attack by the owner of the hut, Rio Santana, and his two leopards who injure her badly. In the dark Rio, who is constantly hunted by the bandits who ambushed Rachael's party, believes her to be a dangerous intruder.<br /><br />Santana, is dark, handsome and deadly - and also prefers to live in solitude - but for entirely different reasons than Rachael's. He works with an elite team of men who rescue kidnap victims from the bandits who operate in the area. Unfortunately, Rachael's leg is torn apart by the leopards in the attack, and Santana must care for her or she will die.<br /><br />The two are drawn together with an intensity that is too strong to be just a normal attraction. During the period it takes for Rachael to recover, they try to ferret out information about each other's lives - not an easy task as both are extremely private people. They begin to discover that they have more in common than most, and that they are both more than they appear on the surface.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the danger to Rachael has increased. Apparently the paid murderers never believed she was dead. Now, however, she has someone who wants to defend her.<br /><br />This is a wonderful paranormal romance as well as a thrilling mystery-adventure. Ms. Feehan's detailed descriptions of the rainforest are lush and enrich the plot. The shapeshifting element is also handled extremely well, and oddly enough, is almost believable.

Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Richard Ben Cramer, has committed a courageous but relatively unpopular act by writing this book. He does not seem to fear sacred cows. Cramer dares to discuss Israel's activities in the occupied territories and the viability of an independent Palestinian State, and by this very act, he impacts the boundaries of the Israeli Palestinian discussion. American Jews are concerned, primarily, with the preservation and security of Israel. But are Israeli leaders as concerned with the principles the state was founded on - the principles I believed in while growing up? \\"We shall be like a light unto the nations of the world,\\" is what I was taught. Israel was to be a beacon of hope and democracy in a hostile world. Cramer, through personal observation and challenging arguments, questions whether the Israelis, and Jews who support them, have forgotten their original high standards and goals. Are we failing ourselves as a people, as a nation? Cramer's narrative revolves around four questions, a modification of the Four Questions asked during the Passover seder: \\"Why do we care about Israel? Why don't the Palestinians have a state? What is a Jewish state? Why is there no peace?\\"<br /><br />Cramer believes that Israel, as the occupier, has become just as much a victim of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza as the Palestinians. He argues that the enduring occupation has corrupted and corroded both Israeli and Arab societies. And he asks, is Israel losing her very soul? I don't know if Mr. Cramer is saying anything here that hasn't been discussed before. All I know is that he has consolidated many of my own thoughts and clarified various issues which have weighed heavily on me for over 30 years. The rise of the Knesset's right wing coalition is discussed at length. The Israeli Supreme Court is taken on for its failure to issue injunctions against demolitions, security checkpoints, land expropriations, torture and assassinations that impact the lives of dozens of innocents along with those targeted. How is it possible for a just and humane society to treat the Palestinians so harshly? And, yes, I can ask this while understanding the violence the Israelis have been subjected to for more than half a century.<br /><br />Cramer paints an extraordinary realistic portrait of the two societies, highlighting people and situations with his wonderful humor and humanism. He is at his best when giving advice to Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat!! His writing and observations are startlingly clear, and his ability to work well with languages lend vigor and flair to the blunt, honest narrative. His anecdotes and personal observations are what make this book so compelling.<br /><br />This is journalism at its best and bound to spark conflict and controversy. I, myself felt, and continue to feel, conflicted about the issues discussed here. I grew up in a secular, Zionist household - Zionism meaning, (to me), \\"a political movement holding that the Jewish people constitute a nation and deserve a national homeland - a return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel.\\" The joining of Jews of all persuasions, left and right, religious and secular, to work together toward tangible and spiritual goals. On the one hand, the author articulately expresses some of my complex feelings and emotions about the Jewish State - many of the problems and paradoxes confronting it - the terrible malaise afflicting it. I relate to his disillusionment. On the other hand I am the first to argue, to defend, to blame the violence, the Intifadas, etc., for the actions of the Israeli government.<br /><br />In Cramer's words, \\"To me, it's an open-and-shut case: You can't ask two generations of your boys to act in the territories as the brutal kings of all they survey ('Break their bones,' was the order to his troops from the sainted Yitzhak Rabin, during the first Intifada -- six years before he became Israel's martyr to peace) -- and then expect those boys to come home, and live in lamblike gentleness as citizens, husbands, dads.\\"<br /><br />A must-read for anyone interested in this major issue which so strongly impacts the today's world.<br /><br />JANAfore he became Israel's martyr to peace) -- and then expect those boys to come home, and live in lamblike gentleness as citizens, husbands, dads.\\"  <br /> <br />A must-read for anyone interested in this major issue which so strongly impacts the today's world. <br />JANA	2004-09-12

There aren't many women or men, like Bree \\"Banzai\\" Maguire. She epitomizes strength of character and integrity - a strong mind in a strong body. Like her grandmother before her, Bree Maguire's motto is, \\"Don't be afraid of death, be afraid of the unlived life.\\" And she has the unique experience of living 2 lives - both fully. Unlike most romance and/or futuristic novels, this heroine is a real butt-kicker! (but she cleans up very well).<br /><br />In the year 2006, Captain Bree Maguire, graduate of the US Airforce Academy, is based in Kunsan Air Base in Korea. On a bitter cold day in late winter, she flies her F-16 in a patrol sortie over North Korea with her best friend, Cam \\"Scarlet\\" Tucker, as her wingman. The two pilots are shot down, with shoulder-launched missiles, and forced to eject over enemy territory. A (mad?) scientist, who is also a North Korean rebel, captures them because he requires young, healthy people for a critical experiment, and these two women fit the bill. The two pilots will serve a duel purpose by being his guinea pigs, and placing the much hated North Korean president in a precarious situation with the US government. He uses new technology to put both Banzai and Cam to sleep in a crypod, in a state of bio-stasis, where they will remain until Banzai is awakened 170 years later, in the year 2176.<br /><br />The USA no longer exists in 2176. It has been replaced by an organization of former nations, called United Colonies of Earth, (UCE), which is definitely not a democracy but a repressive imperial power. Europe and Africa are now allies, and Canada, the victim of a devastating plague, has been closed off to the rest of the world. Korea is now part of the Kingdom of Asia, ruled by the world's most powerful dictator, Kyber, Emperor Prince.<br /><br />Banzai is rescued from her underground tomb and revived by UCE Commander, and Navy SEAL, Tyler Armstrong, who has worshipped the legendary Banzai almost all his life. Unfortunately, the two have no time together to catch up on current events. Kyber's men capture them. Banzai is treated like a royal princess and Tyler is thrown into a stinking dungeon.<br /><br />Both Kyber and Tyler want Bree. Kyber's a nice guy, handsome, rich and powerful, the ruler of Shangrai La - not a bad combo! Tyler is a tough, macho, military type, a charming pirate who has the right chemistry to attract the lady. Bree is trying to acclimate herself to a world that has totally changed and she is determined to find Cam, who is her responsibility. Both men desire and admire Banzai and want to use her to further their own agendas as well as their love lives. Importantly, there is a growing worldwide struggle for freedom - for democracy, which has long been absent from the world community.<br /><br />\\"The Legend of Banzai Maguire\\" sets the stage beautifully for the series of 5 related books, 3 by different authors, with Susan Grant writing the finale, returning Banzai to center stage. There are fascinating plots and subplots in the novel, geared to hold most people's interest. I would have liked Tyler to have been more developed. As is, what stands out most about him is his boylike crush on the much admired woman pilot from another time. Romance, adventure, suspense, politics, world-building, sci-fi, fill the novel's pages. The story doesn't end with a cliffhanger, however. The future of the characters and the world remain unresolved. To find out what happens we have to read the next book, \\"Day of Fire\\" by Kathleen Nance.

Set against the background of contemporary Ireland, the complex, multilayered plot is filled with fascinating tidbits of Celtic culture, folklore, music and history. Indeed, the landscape of western Ireland permeates the plot and heightens the novel's haunting ambiance. Author Erin Hart brings her characters to life, giving them believable personas, feelings and motives. She captures beautifully the cadence of Irish speech, which gives the narrative a realistic lilt.<br /><br />While cutting turf, a Galway farmer discovers the severed head of a woman in the ancient bog. Cormac Maguire, an archeologist and faculty member at the University of Dublin, is called in to investigate when the chief state pathologist determines that the grisly find appears to be centuries old, and not a recent victim. Assisting him is Irish-American archeologist and anatomy expert, Nora Gavin, who has a particular interest in bog bodies. Peat bogs preserve skin, hair, vital organs and even facial features. This particular head belonged to a young woman who had long red hair. The curious townsfolk begin to call her \\"cailin rua,\\" \\"red colleen.\\"<br /><br />The archeologists search for clues in ancient records, folk songs, and local lore, trying to discover the story of the woman's violent death, a murder perpetrated in approximately 1660. Gradually the one investigation turns into a triple murder mystery. Maguire and Gavin are intensely involved with the ancient investigation. They also become more than curious about the recent disappearance of a local woman and her child in the same area where the head was found. The murders remind Nora of her sisters violent death. She believes that her brother-in-law is the killer, but the crime has never been solved. The weight of her sibling's death, along with the two other unsolved mysteries, sits heavily on her.<br /><br />Maguire and Gavin are a wonderful pair with great chemistry, and soon sparks begin to fly. The suspicious villagers give a gothic feel to the story, as do the centuries old buildings, tower and priory. The secondary characters, with all their quirks, feuds and jealousies, are an interesting and realistic lot also.<br /><br />I found myself glued to \\"Haunted Ground.\\" It is a riveting read.<br />JANAchemistry, and soon sparks begin to fly.

Catherine Spangler is one of today's best writers of \\"futuristic romance\\" fiction. I read \\"Shielder\\" before \\"Shadower,\\" but it doesn't matter which book you read first. Both novels stand on their own as excellent examples of the genre, and both take place on the same planet, Giza, sharing some of the same characters, but the storylines are totally different. Ms. Spangler's narratives are extremely well written, her plots are fresh and original, and her characters jump right off the page, they're so realistic. They sure found a place in my heart!<br /><br />Handsome, hunky, alpha-male, Sabin Travers is a Shadower, bounty hunter extraordinaire, supposedly working for \\"The Collectors.\\" Collectors are the evil folks who rule this particular quadrant of the universe, brainwashing and programing most other inhabitants to do their will through telekinetic control. Those outlaws who somehow manage to escape beneath Controller radar are shadowed, found and turned-in by Sabin and others like him. \\"Shadower\\" opens on the hell-like planet Calt, the hang-out for the dregs of the universe. Anteks, Shens, Jaccians, creatures of all kinds - thieves, smugglers, murderers - come to Calt for R&R and dirty business dealings.<br /><br />Sabin is having a lousy day. The person he is hunting has eluded him and he's hot, tired and frustrated. Stepping into a local dive for some Elysian liquor, he sees an absolutely beautiful woman at the end of the bar. Intrigued to find such a woman in a place like this, he offers to keep her company - for her own safety, of course. Moriah, the lovely lady, is a smuggler whose ship has been stolen, stranding her on Calt. She ignores Sabin and enters a game of chance, Fool's Quest, with an unsavory group, hoping to win the money to pay her passage off the planet. Her subsequent good luck turns into a bar brawl. Sabin joins in the fray and the two barely manage to escape alive - without Moriah's winnings.<br /><br />The last thing the lady wants is a man in her life, even for a brief fling. She disengages herself from Sabin, after begrudgingly thanking him. If Sabin knew how Moriah made her living, he would probably arrest her. Wounded from the fight and desperate to leave, Moriah decides that Sabin's ship is her only way off Calt. So she stows away. Unfortunately this proves to be a poor decision, as she inadvertently learns some highly confidential information, while on the voyage, that puts her life in grave danger.<br /><br />Sabin and Moriah get along like cats and dogs in the early part of their relationship. Both are strong-willed, intelligent, highly independent people, and Moriah is operating with some heavy emotional baggage from her past. However, it is obvious that sparks fly between the two from the beginning. As the plot develops, so does the relationship, but the more attached Moriah becomes to Sabin, the more complicated her life seems to become, and she begins to make mistakes and poor decisions trying to complete a dangerous job.<br /><br />There is as much suspense as romance here....and the romance sizzles. Ms. Spangler has created a grim universe where technology, progress and education do not prevent evil. She peoples her story with all kinds of fascinating creatures, and fabulous secondary characters.

Carpathians are a unique race of beings, originating in Romania's Carpathian Mountains, who have existed since humans first inhabited the earth. They are definitely not vampires. They are, however, a different race than man, gifted with the ability to change shape, fly, and move faster than the eye can see - and also able to communicate through both telepathy and language. Acquiring sustenance from human and/or animal blood, they do not kill or turn people into vampires. Carpathians mate for life but since the females rarely live to adulthood, and their childrens' mortality rate is high, not many males are able to find a female suitable for a lifemate....or any female at all. The women provide the light to the males' darker side. After 200 years Carpathian males lose all human feelings, unless they have a mate. The race is dying out and many males, having lived for centuries without wives, often choose to end their existence or turn rogue, (vampire), in despair.<br /><br />Byron Justicano, a Carpathian male, left his homeland to repent for betraying his best friend and to heal, in body and in spirit, after having been captured and tortured by humans and a vengeful vampire. He is an artistic, talented being who works with gemstones and creates beautiful jewelry. One night, while in Italy, he hears Antonietta Scarletti's music, which brings light to his dark world of exile and pain. He stays near her to listen to the soothing music of hope, which she brings to his life when she plays the piano. He knows that in Antonietta, an accomplished concert pianist and composer, he has found his lifemate at last. Byron easily meets her and soon becomes a trusted and beloved companion. He is determined to court her slowly, so that she has time to accept him and understand who and what he is. He wants her to choose him, and his way of life, of her own free will. Carpathian males have been known to take a more forceful approach to wooing their mates.<br /><br />Antonietta was blinded as a child in a terrible explosion that killed her parents. She is a strong, independent career woman, heir to the Scarletti fortune, who assists her grandfather in running the family business. They live together with other members of the Scarletti clan, cousins, spouses and children, in a beautiful, palazzo by the sea, complete with gargoyles, secret passageways, and a mysterious killer jaguar. There, in Palazzo della Morte, age-old family secrets are hidden from the outside world - secrets which are every bit as implausible as those of the Carpathians.<br /><br />Byron saves both Antonietta and her grandfather from kidnappers and almost certain death. She begins to turn to him more and more for assistance, as she and her family are threatened by deceit, poisoning and finally, murder. Someone is stealing ancient family treasures and trying to kill the Scarlattis.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the characters of Byron and Antonietta. The development of their relationship makes for some wonderfully romantic reading. However, other Scarlatti family members are some of the most obnoxious fictional folks I have met in a long while. There were instances when I wished someone would murder them! The plot has some unusual twists and surprises, which makes this novel just as unusual as Ms. Feehan's earlier ones.<br /><br />JANAve been known to take a more forceful approach to wooing their mates. <br /> <br />Antonietta was blinded as a child in a terrible explosion that killed her parents.

Eventually the population of St. Helens evolved into two kinds of humans - \\"prisms\\" and \\"talents,\\" both with psychic ability.

They sure found a place in my heart!<br /><br />Leonessa dan Ranul is a Shielder, a race of people hunted all over their quadrant of the universe by Controllers. Shielders are able to block brainwashing and programing that the Controllers have performed on most inhabitants of the quadrant. Nessa and her people are immune to telekinetic control. However, Shielders are becoming extinct because Controllers and their minions are exterminating them at a rapid rate. A new deadly virus has been developed which only Shielders are vulnerable to. Nessa, is slightly handicapped and therefore shunned by the entire colony on Liron, including her parents. The dwindling colony does not have sufficient resources to share with anyone who is not perfect. She volunteers to be inoculated with the virus. She is willing to become a live host, and travel to the larger, better developed Shielder colony on Sonoma, where someone might be able to create an antidote. She has only four weeks before the virus will manifest itself. With only a small store of supplies and Turi, her affectionate Lanrax pet and only friend, Nessa takes off in an old, outdated transport shuttle.<br /><br />After only two days in space, the decrepit lemon breaks down, leaving Nessa and Turi stranded. They are vulnerable to any passersby, including Shadowers, a group of space bounty hunters who hunt Shielders and criminals to deliver to the Controllers. Chase McKnight is a Shadower, expert bounty hunter, and ship captain, who reluctantly stops to assist Nessa. She disguises herself as a Pilgrim, and he agrees to eventually take her to a planet near Sonoma where she can get transportation to her destination. She must keep Sonoma's location a secret because she fears that McKnight will turn the colony's inhabitants, along with Nessa, over to the Controllers. Nessa is behind schedule and the deadly timeclock within her body is ticking.<br /><br />There is as much suspense as romance here....and the romance sizzles. Ms. Spangler has created a grim universe where technology, progress and education do not prevent evil. She peoples her story with all kinds of fascinating creatures, and two fabulous secondary characters, who are featured in her next book, \\"Shadower.\\" Nessa is an extremely courageous young woman, who has steeled herself to live alone, always. McKnight is her polar opposite, tall, strong and muscular to Nessa's small delicate form; he's an alpha-male, allergic to Lanraxes, she's calm, patient, accepting - no allergies; he is world weary, she is an innocent; he is physically strong, she is disabled. They are both very intelligent and Nessa is a computer wiz. But opposites do attract.<br /><br />The author won the 1998 Emily Award for \\"Shielder\\" and she certainly deserves it. I am addicted to this series. Highly recommended!!<br />JANAcan get transportation to her destination.

Ross is currently Distinguished Fellow and Counselor at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He is best known, however, for the leading role he played in shaping US involvement in the Middle East peace process from 1988 to the breakdown of talks in 2001. Ambassador Ross, a highly skilled diplomat and negotiator, worked tirelessly as our country's point man in both George H. W. Bush's and Bill Clinton's administrations, and dealt directly with all parties involved in the negotiations. Ross assisted the Israelis and Palestinians in reaching the 1995 Interim Agreement. He successfully brokered the Hebron Accord in 1997, and facilitated the Israeli-Jordan peace treaty. Bringing Israel and Syria together was also a priority on his agenda. There was a time when Ross strongly believed that Assad would make a deal with Israel.<br /><br />\\"The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace}\\" is an extraordinary book which chronicles the intricate dance toward peace over a period of 12 years - with all the missteps and crushed toes in between. The period was filled with extraordinary optimism and terrible frustration, from the highlights of the face-to-face negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, which led to the signing of the Oslo Accords, made famous by the handshake on the White House lawn between the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, to the last days of negotiations before President Clinton left office.<br /><br />Prime Minister Rabin was murdered by a Jewish fanatic two years after the Accords were signed. It was hoped that Shimon Peres, Rabin's successor, would win the 1996 elections. Suicide bombings and violence caused Israelis to seriously doubt the Palestinians' intentions to be \\"Partners in Peace.\\" Peres was defeated by Benjamin Netanyahu, a conservative and a hawk. The situation improved when Ehud Barak won the 1999 Israeli election. Unlike Netanyahu, Barak pledged to do everything in his power to work for peace. In July 2000 President Clinton met with both Barak and Arafat at Camp David to come to a final agreement. Although Barak made surprising offers, detailed in the book, Arafat backed out, not even willing to use Barak's offers as a basis for further negotiations. Ross recalls, the Palestinian leader \\"said no to everything,\\" and did not present \\"a single idea or single serious comment in two weeks.\\" Clinton did not give up until he had to turn the White House over to George W. Bush. The author believes that Arafat was never up to \\"ending the conflict\\" - for him \\"violence was always an option.\\" And then the al-Aqsa intifada began.<br /><br />This political memoir is a work of historical significance. Ross, the ultimate insider, shrewdly analyzes the entire process, and really sets the record straight. Ross writes, \\"Only by telling this story can we debunk the myths that prevent all sides from seeing reality and adjusting to it. Indeed, only by telling the story can we hope to learn the lessons from the past and make it possible to shape a different future.\\"<br /><br />I just finished the book, all 872 pages, and I must say I am surprised at how easy it is to read, although it is a bit too long. The narrative moves along at a good pace and is filled with fascinating anecdotes and insightful descriptions of the personalities involved. There are also poignant passages, as when Ross, with prescience, tells a Palestinian negotiator that after the Camp David debacle, G.W. Bush would not touch the issue - that Sharon would become Prime Minister and everything the Palestinians had gained would be lost. So very sad.<br />JANAerything in his power to work for peace.

Tom Bradby does a remarkable job of setting the stage for a series of brutal murders in Russia on the eve of revolution. It is January 1, 1917. Bradby's St. Petersburg literally glitters during the last days of the monarchy. The descriptions of the beautiful city with its opulent Winter Palace, Peter and Paul Cathedral, exquisite architecture, the Neva River where the body of Rasputin was found, the flavor of various neighborhoods and squalid tenements, provide stark contrasts and give the novel a strong sense of reality, without bogging down in detail. The author obviously researched meticulously the period, characters and cityscape for \\"The White Russian: A Novel Of St. Petersburg.\\"<br /><br />The cold is bitter, the population tense. These are indeed turbulent times and this multi-layered novel unfolds parallel to historical events. Chief Investigator of the St. Petersburg Police Department, Sandro Ruzsky, has just returned from a three-year exile in Tobolsk, Siberia and is immediately involved in a double murder. The victims, a young woman and a man were found on the Neva's ice in front of the Tsar's Winter Palace. Within hours of discovering the bodies, the Okhrana, the Tsar's secret police, step in to take over the case. They make it very clear that Ruzsky's assistance is not needed. Sandro, tenacious and jaded, is compelled to pursue the investigation on his own. When the young woman is identified as a former palace employee, Ruzsky wonders if the murders are politically motivated. The Tsarina pushes for Ruzsky to solve the case immediately, while the Ohhrana sabotages him at every turn.<br /><br />Sandro is the black sheep son of an aristocratic family. His father, the Minister of Finance, has banned him from visiting the family home - where his soon-to-be divorced wife and beloved son live. The Ruzskys are alienated and appalled that he chose a career in the police force rather that the Tsar's elite guards.<br /><br />When a third murder takes place and the investigation leads Sandro closer to the Imperial Family, he faces a ruthless killer who taunts him at every turn, and also confronts his past and the woman he once loved. As the storyline accelerates, so do the unstoppable forces of revolution. Everything and everyone Ruzsky cares about is at risk.<br /><br />This is a story of political intrigue, along with the historical social unrest of the times. Members of the doomed royal family are background figures, and the Tsarina is one of the characters. Love, passion, death, betrayal and revenge fill the pages, but above all, this is a mystery with a thrilling ending. The pace is quick and the action is constant. I especially enjoyed the character of Sandro Ruzsky, an extremely complex, honest man of the highest integrity. I couldn't put this super rich story down. Highly recommended!<br /><br />JANAand the investigation leads Sandro closer to the Imperial Family, he faces a ruthless killer who taunts him at every turn, and also confronts his past and the woman he once loved.

This novel stands alone and it is not necessary to read the other \\"Dark\\" novels to appreciate this one - although I think you will enjoy it more if you do. Carpathians are a unique race of beings, originating in Romania's Carpathian Mountains, who have existed since humans first inhabited the earth. They are definitely not vampires. They are, however, a different race than man, gifted with the ability to change shape, fly, and move faster than the eye can see - and also able to communicate through both telepathy and language. Acquiring sustenance from human and/or animal blood, they do not kill or turn people into vampires. Carpathians mate for life but since the females rarely live to adulthood, and their childrens' mortality rate is high, not many males are able to find a female suitable for a lifemate....or any female at all. The women provide the light to the males' darker side. Afer 200 years Carpathian males lose all human feelings, unless they have a mate. They become destructive, aggressive, predatory and can only rely on their strength of mind to keep from breaking the law. The race is dying out and many males, having lived for centuries without wives, often choose to end their existence or turn rogue, (vampire), in despair.<br /><br />Gregori, the most powerful and oldest Carpathian male, is a legendary healer. He is about ready to terminate his life when he learns that two good friends, a Carpathian male and a human woman with psychic abilities, are going to have a child. From this moment, Gregori knows the fetus is a female and will be his lifemate. He bonds with her while she is still in the womb. He becomes a wolf, her beloved companion, when she is a little girl, all the while learning about who she is and allowing her to become familiar with his presence - in any form.<br /><br />As a young woman of eighteen, Savannah Dubrinsky leaves her parents in Romania and moves to the United States to live on her own. Fiercely independent, she tells Gregori she is not ready to mate and needs time to grow as a person. She has never liked the arrogance and possessiveness of Carpathian males. After five years building a career and professional reputation, Savannah is known worldwide as a famous magician, Mistress of Illusion. She is happy with her life as it is. Gregori, however, has reached the end of his limited time. He needs to make Savannah his lifemate immediately if he is to save his soul.<br /><br />\\"Dark Magic\\" is filled with the paranormal, mystery, adventure and romance. However, after reading all four books in the series, I like this one least. Grigori is a much more complex and charismatic figure in the other novels, and comes across as needier and weaker here. There is little in the novel about his healing powers, usually of great interest. Savannah is not as well developed as the author's other female characters. Perhaps this is because she is younger. I also found the plot to be weak. The story is not as original and there is too much repetition of similar events here. If you are a fan of Christine Feehan and the \\"Dark\\" books, you will enjoy this one too. It is just not up to par.<br />JANAve on her own.

With A Plot!!	\\"The Possession\\" is the rare erotic novel - it is well written and actually has a plot on which to hang some varied, sensual and sizzling prose. And this is one hot piece of fiction! There are also two main characters who are very likable, instead of the usual one-dimensional fare. Some of the secondary characters are intriguing also. Anonymous intimacy is a factor here, but romance plays a big part in the plot - which I, personally, enjoy.<br /><br />Kris Torrence, a prim, proper professor of anthropology, is 30-something, single with no love interest in sight and bored. Underneath all her propriety and professionalism, is a passionate, beautiful redhead, longing to do something wild and crazy for once. Her libido is alive but stifled...and really needs some exercise. She sees an advertisement for Hotel Atlantis, an exclusive resort for wealthy gentlemen, situated on a private island off the San Francisco coast. The owner is looking for attractive women, \\"exceptional females,\\" to be \\"submissives\\" for a week. The salary is phenomenal. But money is definitely not why Kris applies for the job.<br /><br />Jack McKenna is the bane of Kris' existence. He is a wealthy businessman who finances a lot of the research in the anthropology department where Kris works - and he's a super hunk! They argue and snap at each other every time they're together, but they have a strong mutual attraction. He is a close friend of Hotel Atlantis' owner and his vacation, surprisingly coincides with Kris' week-long adventure. Sparks fly! And fantasies come true - for the reader also!!<br /><br />I read \\"The Possession\\" in a few hours. Jaid Black knows how to tell a steamy tale, and her use of humor is wonderful. The prose is graphic and deals with exhibitionism, voyeurism, light bondage, etc., etc., and some of the language is explicit. Highly recommended for those who like erotic fiction, but not for the faint of heart! Enjoy the wild ride!<br /><br />JANA	2004-09-05

I love Elizabeth Lowell's novels, especially those featuring the Donovan family, with its Alpha-males and super talented women. I hoped that \\"Die In Plain Sight,\\" with Donavan matriarch Susa as a major character, would be on par with \\"Jade Island,\\" \\"Amber Beach,\\" and \\"Midnight on Ruby Bayou.\\" Unfortunately, it is not. I have been disappointed in Ms. Lowell's last few books and that's a real shame, as she has long been a favorite writer. I'm not about to give up on her though. She has given me much enjoyment over the years and I am sure she still has many terrific stories to tell and dynamic new characters to reveal.<br /><br />Artist Lacy Quinn's grandfather bequeathed all his paintings to her upon his death. There are extraordinary landscapes and other, more disturbing canvasses depicting violence and death. Grandfather and granddaughter had an exceptionally close relationship, from the time she was a little girl and first began to show interest in art and painting until the man's death at a fairly young age. Lacy is different from her wealthy, society family - more at home painting in jeans than dancing in designer gowns. Her grandfather was a black sheep of sorts - so the two found comfort and inspiration in each others company. Lacy is determined to show famous artist Susa Donovan her grandfather's work and have it evaluated when she discovers Ms. Donovan will be in town to support a charity event. Lacy's parents, especially her father, warn her that bringing the old paintings to the public's attention might stir up some disagreeable truths, old rumors, that are best left alone. Lacy agrees to present the work under an assumed name so no one will identity it with the Quinn family - especially since the paintings are all unsigned. Standing in line, waiting for her turn with Susa, Lacy meets hunky Ian Lapstrake, an employee of Rarities Unlimited, Donovan friend and Susa's temporary bodyguard. Ian is smitten at first glance with the sexy, sassy young artist with the curly auburn hair. Also at first glance, Susa realizes the value and high quality of the paintings Lacy has brought. In fact, she believes she knows the artist. Ian is aware that Lacy is using an assumed name and offers his assistance to discover the long hidden secrets behind the artwork and a series of unexplained deaths that had been ruled accidental.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong. The novel is worth reading. The plot is engaging, although it plods at times, detracting from both the mystery and the romance. The characters, as always, are well developed and interesting, but not as outstanding as usual. I hope the author does better with her next effort.<br /><br />JANAthe curly auburn hair.

So I picked up \\"Shadow Game,\\" looking forward to something new from the author. I settled down to a good read and, unfortunately, found myself disappointed. There are too many convoluted twists and turns for the novel to be a credible mystery thriller. The writing seems forced, and frequently over-embellished. The characters are much flatter than Ms. Feehan's usually impressive offerings. Her secondary characters are basically indistinguishable.<br /><br />Captain Ryland Miller of the U.S. Army Special Forces is the leader of a band of men, military and civilian, who are all gifted with exceptionally high natural clairvoyant abilities. The group volunteered to participate in a Top Secret military experiment which would utilize their paranormal talents. Dr. Peter Whitney, a wealthy and brilliant scientist, had attempted, through research and a series of experiments to mold the men into a powerful military weapon, an elite squadron, using their honed paranormal skills. Each man can communicate telepathically and influence the minds of others around him. A few of them have additional gifts, like telekinesis. But something has gone terribly wrong with the project. The men have experienced migraines, seizures and some have even died. When they decided to cease and desist, they were placed in cage-like cells and held against their will in an underground laboratory. Treated like lab rats, denied contact with one another, their morale and emotional states are in drastic decline. Captain Miller is certain someone has sabotaged the experiment and will do anything to free his comrades and discover the facts surrounding their illnesses and deaths.<br /><br />Enter Dr. Lily Whitney, Peter Whitney's daughter, who has some impressive paranormal skills of her own. Of course, she is sympathetic to Miller's predicament and, of course, sparks fly between the two as soon as she walks through the lab door. Caged Alpha-male and lovely, empathetic scientist - what else would you expect? When she attempts to discover just what is endangering the men involved in the experiment, her father is mysteriously murdered. Lily is determined to find out who the murderer is - and probably discover the saboteur at the same time. She and the Captain might be able to be of mutual assistance.<br /><br />There's so much potential in this paranormal plot outline, that I feel like the author has let possible magic slip through her fingers. In spite of all my criticism, the book is worth reading. It will probably hold your interest - but is just not up to Ms. Feehan's usual standards.<br /><br />JANAwo as soon as she walks through the lab door.

His voice haunts her dreams and finally she feels compelled to find his place of imprisonment and try to save his life.

Shea has a rare blood disease and needs constant blood transfusions to remain alive.<br /><br />Shea does find Jacques but they are both in terrible danger.

Ms. Feehan brings back characters from her first Carpathian novel and introduces others.

Ms. Dowd is one of the major reasons I subscribe to the New York Times. Her usually scathing commentaries on the paper's Op-ed page almost always make me smile, if not laugh outright. And humor is a necessary commodity, especially in today's world - especially if you live in New York City, which I do. I may not always agree with who she is zinging, but her wit, insights and caricatures are exceptional. \\"I think I'm an equal opportunity skeptic,\\" she says. \\"I used to tweak Clinton just as much...(as Bush).\\"<br /><br />I couldn't resist picking up a copy of this anthology of over 100 Dowd columns summarizing the Bush Dynasty, George W. (the Boy King), and George H. W. (the Old King), which she aptly calls \\"Bushworld.\\" The columns are relatively short, but they are long on satire. Do they lack substance at times? Well, yeah. But most well read people, current on current events, will know the issues and the people she writes about. I can read and appreciate satire on Richard Nixon, JFK, President Clinton, Gerald Ford, etc., without referring to history books before I \\"get it.\\"<br /><br />Among her most memorable columns, Dowd does a Bush casted \\"Star Wars,\\" with Number 43 as Luke Skywalker, who has a good father, (his own dad, Number 41), who believed in internationalism, the Atlantic alliance, togetherness and other good things. Then there's Darth Vader, (the bad, dark father), Dick Cheney, of course, who leads the president astray. Her takes on the Boy Emperor, Rummy, Condi, Wolfie, Uncle Dick of the Underworld, General Karl, Prince of Darkness (Richard Perle), and how they forward their agendas and struggle for power is irony to the 6th power. As she writes, \\"It's their reality. We just live and die in it.\\"<br /><br />Maureen Dowd won a Pulitzer Prize in 1999 for her columns on the Clinton impeachment. I think she brings something original to the journalism table - a unique sense of theater. If you enjoy the acerbic, if satire and dark humor is your thing, if you are a political junkie and don't mind politicians getting zapped, even if it is your favorite pol - then this is your book. I loved it!!<br />JANAmor is your thing, if you are a political junkie and don't mind politicians getting zapped, even if it is your favorite pol - then this is your book. I loved it!!

Special Agent Isabel Adams of the FBI's Special Crimes Unit, the elite unit made up of psychic agents, is assigned to investigate a series of horrific murders in Hastings, SC. Isabel is a top notch profiler and clairvoyant. Her partner, Hollis Templeton, is a medium. Together with local Police Chief, Rafe Sullivan, they pool their skills and resources, paranormal and otherwise, to catch the serial killer menacing the town - a killer who epitomizes evil.<br /><br />Obviously Agent Adams is beautiful, blonde, sexy, smart, savvy, a martial arts expert, sharpshooter and an excellent investigator. Police Chief Sullivan isn't bad on the eyes either. Yes. Sparks fly...with paranormal results.<br /><br />I like Kay Hooper's psychic series. However, my favorites are \\"Out Of The Shadows,\\" featuring Noah Bishop who heads the Special Crimes Unit, and Sheriff Miranda Knight, and \\"Stealing Shadows.\\" \\"Sense of Evil\\" held my interest and is a good light read, if somewhat gruesome. However, it doesn't hold up to the high standards Ms. Hooper set in the above mentioned novels. The characters here are less developed, not as complex, and the story is somewhat formulaic. The mystery is a good one, however. I sure couldn't figure out whodunit!<br /><br />JANA	2004-08-22

It is a testimony really, to the author's mother, a white Jewish woman who married a black man, and how she struggled to raise her children in a racist environment, and in poverty. She managed to instill in her children a deep respect for God, religion and for education, and sent all twelve to college. I recently spent the weekend at a friend's home where I saw the book and picked it up to reread. I believe, even more strongly now, that \\"The Color Of Water\\" is very special, and feel compelled to pass the word along to those who have yet to read this unique memoir.<br /><br />James McBride, the author, grew up in the all-black housing projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn. He was one of twelve siblings. His father was a black minister and his Mom, a Polish-born, Southern-raised Jewish mother. As a boy, growing up, James always knew his mother was different. When he would ask her about differences in skin color, she would reply, \\"I am light skinned.\\" When he asked whether he was black or white, her response was, \\"You're a human being.\\" And when James asked what color God was, his mother said, \\"God is the color of water.\\"<br /><br />Mr. McBride has written a powerful piece about race, identity and growing up in a multiracial, multicultural home. The writing is lyrical and well crafted. The story is unforgettable. Highly recommended.<br /><br />JANA	2004-08-22

No matter what your political affiliation, even if you are a conservative and staunch Bush supporter, I recommend that you save your money! \\"Not Fit for Command\\" is an obvious attempt to smear Senator John F. Kerry and disparage his Vietnam War record. With all its vindictive allegations, this is more a condemnation of coauthors John E. O'Neill and Jerome R. Corsi, and their credibility, than of Senator Kerry. I don't think our political process has ever been anything but wild and woolly, but I am reminded here of some of the dirty tricks that went on during the campaigns of Richard Nixon, many staged by his top trickster Charles Colsen.<br /><br />Most of the people interviewed and quoted here belong to an organization called \\"Swift Boat Veterans For Truth.\\" Their primary gripe is that Kerry turned antiwar activist after his term of service ended, and that he, as the former leader of the major veterans organization opposing continuation of the war, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in April 1971. Many, if not all, the members of \\"Swift Boat Veterans For Truth\\" believe that Kerry turned traitor by stating war crimes had been committed by US troops in Southeast Asia. His testimony was backed by 150 honorably discharged, and many very highly decorated, veterans. I can understand the veterans' anger - but to vent it by questioning and politicizing the quality of Kerry's service to our country is reprehensible, and does a disservice to all who serve in our armed forces.<br /><br />In \\"Unfit For Command\\" the authors' allegations include: ** All three of John Kerry's Purple Hearts were for minor injuries, easily treated with band-aids, not requiring a single hour of hospitalization. Two of the wounds are purported to have been self-inflicted (!) and one was a fanny wound - so that obviously didn't count, right? ** John Kerry is alleged to have ordered the slaughter of \\"small\\" pigs and chickens after arriving at a small Vietnamese hamlet. Lt. Kerry pulled out his trusty Zippo lighter and proceeded to set the tiny villages of 3-4 huts on fire. (Oh please!) ** John Kerry carried a typewriter and an 8-mm home movie camera with him to Vietnam so he could record his own exaggerated version of his war exploits. (How do the authors know his motivation and who cares?). ** John Kerry earned his silver star by shooting a \\"lone, fleeing, teenage Viet Cong in a loincloth.\\" During an incident in the Delta when Kerry and his crew were fired upon, says McNeill, \\"...a young Viet Cong in a loincloth popped out of a hole, clutching a grenade launcher, which may or may not have been loaded.\\" (WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LOADED!??). Perhaps the Lt. should have stopped the young man and asked him, before firing, if his weapon had ammunition.<br /><br />Neither the book's authors, nor the participants, served under Kerry's command - or even served with Kerry. No one came forth with any of these allegations 30 years ago. They waited until last spring when it was clear that Senator Kerry would win his Party's nomination.<br /><br />So what do we know for absolute fact about John Kerry's military record.<br /><br />** John Kerry volunteered for duty in Vietnam.<br /><br />** After completing Naval Officer Candidates School, he began his first tour of duty on the USS Gridley, a guided-missile frigate in the waters adjacent to Vietnam.<br /><br />** In 1968, John Kerry began his second tour of duty, and volunteered to serve on a Swift Boat, one of the most dangerous assignments of the war.<br /><br />** He did receive 3 Purple Hearts, (for whatever reason).<br /><br />** He did receive a Silver Star and a Bronze Star, (again, for whatever reasons).<br /><br />** He rescued the life of at least one of his crew mates - witnessed by all his crewmates.<br /><br />** He saw battle and took fire.<br /><br />This is all irrefutable.<br /><br />By the way, not to be petty, but the book's narrative is choppy and repetitious. After a while the scandal mongering actually becomes boring. Do yourself a favor, if you are curious, go to a bookstore and browse. The book can be read in a few hours. What ever happened to integrity, honesty and civility.<br />JANAore and browse. The book can be read in a few hours. What ever happened to integrity, honesty and civility.  JANA	2004-08-19

According to the Talmud, Rev Yehuda taught that 40 days before a male child is conceived, a voice from heaven announces whose daughter he is going to marry, literally a match made in heaven! In Yiddish, this perfect match is called \\"bashert,\\" a word meaning fate, destiny - or one's soul mate. Ruchama King has written a gem of a novel about a woman and two men in search of their \\"besherts.\\" These three lonely people are Americans, all observant Jews, who have moved to Jerusalem to make new lives for themselves. After years of unsuccessfully searching for the \\"right one,\\" they decide to seek help from two local matchmakers.<br /><br />Beth, approaching forty, is attractive, extremely independent and very conscious that she is one of the few women her age who does not wear a head covering - a sign of marriage. She has never been touched, nor kissed, by any male other than her father. And her biological clock keeps reminding her that her prospects are dwindling with every tick. Akiva is a sensitive, spiritual, appealing man, with a debilitating twitch which he sees as a blessing. And Binyamin, a handsome, charming, narcissistic artist, gets blacklisted by all Jerusalem's matchmakers because he seeks perfection in his mate. All three long for an end to their loneliness.<br /><br />The matchmakers and their husbands don't exactly live in a Garden of Eden. Tsippe, is a holocaust survivor married to a man whose life she saved in the concentration camps. She yearns for passion and romance from her husband, whose head is always in a book. Judy, a beautiful former rebbetzin, feels that something important has disappeared from her marriage. Her husband, who used to be a Torah scholar, is now an exterminator and Judy misses aspects of her old life.<br /><br />\\"Seven Blessings\\" is much more than a story about the search for a mate. All of Ms. King's characters seem to be striving for a close connection with another being, to balance their universe, and this search is directly related to their quest to connect more intimately with God. I am struck by a conversation between Judy and a group of women studying Torah. They are talking about the creation in Genesis - whether God created woman only for the benefit of man. They study a commentary from Rashi which basically says that \\"this state of man being alone is not good for the universe. It's a cosmological statement. This aloneness is not good for the world. Woman was not created to complement man but to complete the world.\\"<br /><br />Ruchama King's prose simply flows along at a graceful pace. Her characters are three dimensional and very real. She is an extremely perceptive person, and I found the novel to be very funny at times, and at others it touched my heart. Although we are offered a peek into the lives of Orthodox Jews, one does not feel voyeuristic at all. And the beauty of the Torah and Talmud shines through every page. But you definitely do not have to be Jewish to enjoy this book. I have lent my copy to several friends and they have all loved it. \\"Seven Blessings\\" is a universal story.<br /><br />JANArectly related to their quest to connect more intimately with God.

I love Grandma Mazur, Stephanie's maternal grandmother, and a pistol-packin,' roller blading clotheshorse. The super sexy men in Steph's life, hot cop, live-in lover Joe Morelli, and \\"The Ranger,\\" who is beyond description in a simple book review, are the best - as are all the other wacky eccentrics who populate Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum mysteries. To tell the truth, I would probably read a plotless Stephanie novel, just to visit with the cast. However, \\"Ten Big Ones,\\" the 10th volume of her adventures, is far from plotless and will keep you on the edge of your seat, scared, spellbound, and roaring with laughter, while you enjoy the frequently hilarious capers. Steph's less dangerous bail-jumpers, and their crimes, are too funny, and the humor balances the dangers she faces.<br /><br />Stephanie, as always, is on the wrong side of every door. She and her partner, trigger happy, reformed prostitute Lula, go out for nachos and walk into a robbery at the local convenience store. The robbery leads to an explosion which inevitably leads to the destruction of another car. Stephenie did get a look at the devil-masked hold-up man's face. Because she can identify the \\"Red Devil,\\" his gang wants to eliminate her. She decides to hide, with the help of the enigmatic Ranger who offers her sanctuary, while she figures out how to capture the dangerous killer known as \\"The Junkman.\\" Her long suffering boyfriend, Joe Morelli, is not thrilled with her hiding place or with the entire situation. He never is. He'd love for Stephanie to become a stay-at-home Mom. Hah!<br /><br />This is one of the most suspenseful novels yet. I love this series. What a trip!!<br /><br />JANA	2004-08-17

I have been waiting for over a year for \\"The Immortal Highlander\\" to hit the bookstores. I may be Karen Marie Moning's biggest fan, having read and loved every magical, unique novel she has published. I especially like \\"The Dark Highlander\\" and \\"The Kiss of the Highlander.\\" Adam Black, our hero here, had small, but important roles in these two novels, and Ms. Moning does not disappoint with her latest, Adam's story. It is not necessary to have read her prior books to enjoy this one. \\"The Immortal Highlander\\" stands on its own.<br /><br />Black belongs to \\"Tuatha De Danaan,\\" a highly advanced race of immortal beings that settled in Ireland thousands of years before the birth of Christ. Although this race is called by many names, they are most commonly referred to as Fae or Faery. Frequently portrayed as tiny, luminescent creatures who flit around, the true \\"Tuatha De Danaan\\" are neither small nor benevolent. Adam Black is a rogue among his own kind. He meddles too much in the affairs of men, frequently taking on the human form of a tall, dark, and (you got it!), handsome male, powerfully built and extremely seductive. He is unpredictable, arrogant, mesmerizing...and Trouble, with a capital \\"T.\\"<br /><br />Aoibheal, Queen of the \\"Tuatha De Danaan,\\" punishes Black for his interference in the world of mortals, by stripping him of his immortality and making him human. And to make matters worse, she curses him with the threefold power of feth fiada - which makes him invisible to mankind. No one can see him, hear him, touch him. And almost as bad, now he feels hunger, thirst, fatigue, lust, and loneliness. His own kind, although they can see him clearly, have been forbidden to acknowledge him. After months in this state, Adam is desperate.<br /><br />Enter human female, Gabrielle O'Callaghan, who is (yes) lovely, intelligent and has the gift of sight. She can see both worlds - mortal and faery, which to her has always been a curse rather than a gift. Gabrielle can see and hear Adam. Once he finds this out, and he does very rapidly, he will not leave her alone. Besides wanting very much to seduce her, she may be the only means he has of communicating with humans or faeries.<br /><br />Adam must persuade Gabrielle to help him in his quest to regain his immortality - a quest that will take them into a world of magic where they discover a conspiracy to destroy both mortal and faery realms.<br /><br />As with Ms. Moning's other novels, this one has it all - romance, magic, time travel, extraordinary characters, great plot, writing that flows, and most important, an original theme and storyline.

The Commission was given a sweeping mandate: To investigate the \\"facts and circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\\" Over 2.5 million pages of documents were reviewed by the bipartisan committee and their staff, and more than 1,200 individuals were interviewed in ten countries. The Committee's work, their report and recommendations, is unique in our country's history and is probably one of the most important documents of our times. Because of almost unprecedented access to classified documents, the report provides an in-depth look into decision making at the highest levels of government.<br /><br />Striving to be impartial, independent, thorough and nonpartisan, this group of dedicated men and women conducted, over a 20-month period, an exhaustive and transparent investigation to find the truth - which they shared with the American people in open hearings. This 567-page final report concludes that the US government \\"failed to protect the American people\\" from terrorist attacks mainly because it did not understand the \\"gravity of the threat.\\"<br /><br />The report is extremely critical of the lack of action on the part of the FBI and CIA, especially given the clear warnings prior to 9/11 that \\"Islamist terrorists meant to kill Americans in high numbers.\\" The Commission finds that both services suffered from having too many priorities, flat budgets, outmoded structures and bureaucratic rivalries. A top recommendation is the creation of a National Counter-Terrorism Center, (NCTC,) to be overseen by a National Intelligence Director, who would be able to influence the budget and leadership of the CIA, FBI, Homeland Security Department and Defense Department.<br /><br />The report cites nine operational failures within the US: Not putting two hijackers on a \\"watch list;\\" not sharing information linking individuals on the USS Cole attack in Aden, Yemen, which killed 17 American sailors in 2000, to one of the highjackers; not taking adequate steps to find two highjackers who were already in the U.S.; not linking the arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui to heightened indications of an attack; not uncovering false statements on visa applications; not recognizing false passports; not expanding no-fly lists to include names from terrorist watch lists; not searching airline passengers identified as possible threats through a computer screening system.<br /><br />The report reads like a novel, especially the 1st part - \\"We Have Some Planes.\\" The historic foundation and evolution of the new terrorism are thoroughly explored in a highly readable fashion, as are the US responses to terrorist attacks prior to 9/11. The September 11th attack on our homeland is analyzed in depth from inception to its final disastrous completion. And the threat we now face is clearly defined, at last. Clear and concise recommendations are provided at the report's conclusion. It is my fervent hope that these recommendations will be carefully examined and acted on as soon as possible.<br /><br />I am a Manhattanite. I was ten blocks away from the World Trade Center when the first plane, American Airlines Flight 11, hit the North Tower. I didn't see the plane, but I did hear its roar as it flew overhead - so close. I saw the second plane hit the South Tower. I cannot begin to recount the horrors of that day, or the aftermath. I am still effected. I lost many friends and colleagues on September 11, and I still grieve for them, deeply. I cannot express what it feels like to hold this completed volume in my hands.

Set in South Florida, Hiaasen highlights the area's nuttiness and some of the weird folks who inhabit that corner of our country. Not one character could be considered \\"normal\\" in this novel, but behind strange facades beat good hearts.<br /><br />Joey Perrone, the almost-murdered wife of corrupt Charles \\"Chaz\\" Perrone, makes it back to shore after her husband tosses her overboard a cruise ship, far off Key West's coast. He must have underestimated Joey's talents. She's a former swim star. And thanks to a floating bale of marijuana and the assistance of Mick Stranahan, a burnt-by-love ex-cop, she doesn't sink. Oh no! Joey lives for pay-back.<br /><br />Chaz, an incompetent marine biologist, (he doesn't even know which direction the Gulf Stream flows in), has long been on the take from agribusiness tycoon Red Hammernut, (great name!), who's been dumping fertilizer into the endangered Everglades. He thinks that Joey has discovered that he's been exchanging clean-water samples for the actual tainted water that is the result of Hammernut's environmental pollution.

But she had a wonderful job, as the director of a small maritime museum, the home she grew up in - a cottage on the beautiful Maine coast, her friends and her close companion, Otto, a friendly rottweiler, (not an oxymoron) - so she was happy. Then a nor'easter blew in and swept her home into the sea. That's when she packed her bags, and Otto, into her rusting station wagon and drove cross-country to begin her life anew in San Franciscio - and to realize her dream to open an art gallery.<br /><br />Mission accomplished in a relatively short time, Annie accepted a commission from one of her gallery's first visitors, an eccentric older woman, who happens to be an extremely talented artist. She asked Annie to represent her at an auction and bid, to win, on a painting. Enthused at the idea of one day exhibiting this painter's work, Annie accepts and finds herself neck deep in a five year-old double murder mystery, involving San Francisco's society elite.<br /><br />This is the first book I have read by Carla Neggers. I was attracted to the author when I saw one of her book titles on Amazon.com and read glowing reviews. I picked up this novel expecting to be wowed (!) and instead found myself disappointed. Now, \\"Just Before Sunrise\\" is not a bad book. I did find it boring, however - and I am rarely bored. I think the story, and the way it is told, is repetitous. Annie keeps going back and forth between her elderly patron, Sarah, the love interest and hero, Gavin, and to everyone else who is remotely involved with the auctioned painting. All the conversations are similar and they are all about the same subject. There's not much substance to the romance or to the mystery - which I figured out about 100 pages into the story. And the characters are not very exciting or original- except for Otto. So, I can't figure out what all the excitement is about. I will probably read another novel by Ms. Neggers someday. I don't give up easily, especially when it seems like she has such loyal fans.<br /><br />JANAexcitement is about. I will probably read another novel by Ms. Neggers someday.

Germond is the \\"fat man\\" of the title. And he IS fed up with American electoral politics. As a newspaperman he covered national politics since the 1960 presidential election. He spent 20 years covering the political arena for the Gannett Newspapers, the Washington Star and the Baltimore Sun. I used to listen to his commentary regularly on the Today Show, The McLaughlin Group, and Inside Washington and, now that he has retired, I miss his punditry. I picked up a copy of his recent book \\"Fat Man Fed Up: How American Politics Went Bad,\\" because I too am fed up and believe that today's politics are as bad as I have experienced - and I clearly remember some rotten political abuses in the 1960s and 70s. Germond addresses the decline of substance, civility and integrity in politics today. And he certainly doesn't disappoint readers with this scathing, witty, insightful assessment.<br /><br />\\"Fat Man Fed Up\\" tackles problems that other journalists seem reluctant to address. Indeed he believes that one of the reasons politics has gone bad is because journalists have allowed it to. He laments that most newspapers seem to have lost interest in politics, while talk radio and cable TV news have increased divisiveness and partisanship in the country. Mr. Germond responds to complaints of liberal bias in the media and points out that these complaints \\"miss the real point.\\" He questions if the bias actually exists, and if so, whether it colors the way editors and reporters work. Germond takes today's press to task for its failure to accurately portray prominent political figures - from Barbara Bush to Al Sharpton. Politicians and the media are criticized for their use and abuse of political polls to mislead uninformed and gullible voters.<br /><br />Germond also holds forth on the extraordinary influence of TV on the electorate, and campaign coverage driven by sound bites. He reminds the reader that the TV networks control dialogue and all but the most simplistic, shallow political coverage is provided. Given that many Americans are not particularly knowledgeable or politically savvy, candidates and their managers know how to manipulate them. Meanwhile, Germond writes, the media focuses on all the wrong things - meaningless polls and meaningless scandals. I recently heard him cite the coverage given to whether John Kerry threw away his Vietnam War medals or his ribbons during a demonstration that occurred over 30 years ago. \\"Who cares?\\" he asks. Politics today, he claims, is built on television, money, and celebrity. Germond also blasts \\"the big lie\\" school of campaigning - where empty slogans and noise sell the candidates.<br /><br />What I most enjoy about this book, however, are not the problems Germond discusses, but the wonderful anecdotes - the juicy tidbits - he supplies to illustrate his points. Most of these are drawn from his own experiences.<br /><br />This is much more than the usual election year publication. \\"Fat Man Fed Up\\" is a memoir of sorts, of and by a reporter who has seen it all and offers you his memories, close up and personal, of past presidential candidates, elections and our political process. Mr. Germond's prose is a wonderful example of the plain style in American journalism. He conveys both facts and opinions in a crisp, concise manner, unadorned with spin or hype. He has a wonderful way with words and his prose is a pleasure to read. Pertinent, highly readable and, at times, outrageous, this book is difficult to put down. Highly recommended!<br /><br />JANAnetworks control dialogue and all but the most simplistic, shallow political coverage is provided.

Barak Arvid, a twenty-fourth century warlord, is given urgent instructions by the Temporal Enforcement agency to travel back in time 300 years, to 2004. His mission is to protect reporter Jane Colby from certain death at the hands of the time-traveling Jumpkiller, Kalag Druss. Barak is a genetically engineered human, whose body is five times stronger than 21st century humans, and whose bones are so dense they are practically unbreakable. He has a \\"neuroweb combat computer woven through his brain, giving him access to a vast data bank and information from sensor implants scattered throughout his body.\\" In other words - he's brilliant, an honest-to-God know-it-all! He is also a super sensual hunk - six feet five, long dark hair, chiseled features, and a sex drive that doesn't stop.<br /><br />Ms. Colby, the owner of a local newspaper and a crime reporter, is pretty attractive herself - and feisty, independent and intelligent. What else? She's our heroine. Jane covers a brutal murder close to her home, where the victim, a young woman, literally looks as if Jack the Ripper had spent some time with her. Shaken, Jane returns to her house and finds Barak and his sidekick Frieka, a genetically engineered talking wolf and warrior. Needless to say, Jane, after she gets over her initial terror at finding superman and mouthy canine making themselves at home in her domain, thinks she has lost her mind. She is finally convinced that Barak is there to protect her, and will not leave her side, accompanying her to bed and bath, untill the killing machine has been taken out of commission.<br /><br />Not unbelievably the two get it on in some of the steamiest scenes I have read, and then fall in love. This could certainly distract Barak from his mission, as the fierce warrior was really not programed to love and had never experienced the feeling before.<br /><br />\\"Jane's Warlord\\" is a delightful, exciting sci-fi romance, suspense thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat, spellbound, when you're not mooning over Barak. Sidekicks Frieka and Jane's cat, Octopussy, provide terrific humor. And the villain, whose criminal history will certainly surprise you, is as evil as they get. Angela Knight's writing is skillful, savvy and smart. Her characters are most original and credible, (given their incredible history). The dialogue, especially the banter, is at times hilarious, and at times deeply moving.<br /><br />I was sorry to finish this novel, and as soon as I did I looked up Ms. Knight's other books for possible purchase. She has earned herself another fan!<br /><br />JANAspellbound, when you're not mooning over Barak. Sidekicks Frieka and Jane's cat, Octopussy, provide terrific humor.

Based on more than three and a half hours of exclusive interviews with President Bush, interviews with 75 key participants, as well as access to memos, transcripts of phone calls on secure lines, even Power Point presentations from military computers, \\"Plan of Attack\\" documents the history of the 16 critical months which led up to this controversial war. Woodward's authoritative narrative examines its causes and consequences.<br /><br />The book begins with a private meeting between Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, on Nov. 21, 2001, shortly after the September 11th attack. Bush asks Rumsfeld for a war plan for Iraq, presumedly to search for and destroy weapons of mass destruction, get rid of Saddam Hussein, and to move that country toward democratization. President Bush also requests that Secretary Rumsfeld do this with utmost secrecy because a leak could trigger \\"enormous international angst and domestic speculation.\\" This task was assigned a little over a month after the war in Afghanistan was launched. The remainder of \\"Plan of Attack\\" is the mostly clandestine effort to bring that plan to fruition. The principals involved are quoted extensively and the details are well documented. Insightful and intimate portraits emerge of President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, CIA Director George Tenet, and General Tommy Franks, among others.<br /><br />One of the observations that most struck me is that, according to Woodward and the documentation, momentous, defining decisions made by the president do not appear to have been thoroughly examined or discussed. Pros and cons were not weighed. And the war seems preordained. Even before Bush was inaugurated, Vice President Cheney decided that \\"topic A\\" of the new president's first national security briefing should be Iraq.<br /><br />Mr. Woodward, an assistant managing editor of The Washington Post, and author of several best-selling books, has told the administration's story faithfully. He presents a non-biased chronicle of the road to war. Facts, along with anecdotal information, are presented as they were recorded or observed. Woodward doesn't add to or detract from this gripping account, that reads like a suspense thriller, by inserting op-edish comments or drawing conclusions. He leaves that job to the reader - one of the few books I have ever read which does so. Mr. Woodward has presented us with an invaluable historical document. Information like this is usually not released until years after the end of an administration. For this reason alone, it is a serious and very important piece of writing.

Obviously, this firsthand knowledge makes his work all the more authentic. I simply do not understand why McCarry is not better known, nor why his books, especially \\"The Last Supper\\" and \\"The Tears of Autumn,\\" are not considered classics. He is certainly in the same literary league with John LeCarre, Alan Furst, Eric Ambler and Ken Follet. I read McCarry's \\"The Last Supper\\" a few years ago and it is my favorite book in this genre - absolutely top notch! I have read most of his other novels since then, and have found them all to be superior. McCarry's nuanced, at times poetic, writing style, his ability to create real, flesh and blood characters who will move you, and his fast-paced, taunt storylines, put him at the top of the list for craftsmanship. I immediately picked up a copy of \\"Old Boys,\\" McCarry's 10th novel, as soon as it hit the stores.<br /><br />Intelligence agent Paul Christopher, often a major character in McCarry's novels, is present in this one also. Unfortunately, the suave, sophisticated agent's appearance is brief. The novel opens with the aging, but extremely fit, Christopher dining with his cousin Horace Hubbard, another former agent. Dinner is excellent, the conversation interesting, if unremarkable. Paul Christopher vanishes the next day. Unbelievably, his ashes are delivered by a Chinese official to the American consulate in Beijing many months later. Christopher had supposedly died in a remote corner of China. After a memorial service in Washington, Horace, who is not convinced that Paul is dead, recruits four other retired colleagues - a kind of All Star bunch of \\"Old Boys,\\" to go back into the field to find Christopher. Their first clue is a photograph found in Paul's study revealing an ancient scroll sought by both the US government and Muslim extremists. Hunted and hounded all over the globe, from Xinjiang to Brazil, then Rome, Tel Aviv, Budapest and Moscow, the old pros, with Christopher's beautiful daughter Zarah providing support, search for their comrade and the answers to his disappearance. These men may have mellowed but they are still quick on their feet...and on the uptake.<br /><br />McCarry does not write \\"light.\\" Like most of his novels this one is complex and tackles deeper themes than mystery and suspense. His characters are three-dimensional and the writing tight. There is also a nostalgia here for a dying breed, the agents of old who fought and helped to win the Cold War. While a very good read, \\"Old Boys is not on par with Charles McCarry's best works. I do recommend it, however. It is still a good, long yarn that will hold your attention and leave you spellbound.<br />JANAboth the US government and Muslim extremists.

I may be Karen Marie Moning's biggest fan! I have read all of her books and \\"The Dark Highlander\\" is my favorite. Daegus MacKelter, the dark, intense, super-alpha hero, (the most alpha man around), is the reason. He is smart, sexy, enchanting and determined. Once you meet him, you won't be able to put this book down. The plot happens to be intelligent and exciting also.<br /><br />Daegus is a 16th century Highlander living in a lush apartment in 21st century Manhattan. Yes, there's time travel here, as well as magic, romance, mystery, adventure and edge-of-your-seat suspense. McKelter is in this century searching for an ancient manuscript, from his time, so he can find the method to exorcise the thirteen evil Druid entities that possess him. He has to find the texts soon because their dark presence threatens to take him over completely, and their power grows with every minute.<br /><br />Chloe Zanders, an antiquities dealer who is especially interested in 16th century military pieces, is found in Daegus' apartment snooping through his texts and manuscripts. She had actually gone there on official business. When she found the door unlocked she entered. Daegus was not at home - but his treasures, ancient artifacts which appear new, are all over the place, right out in the open - like a museum! How can she resist? Actually Daegus is the one who finds her....and he ties her up. How like an alpha male! He is immediately drawn to this intelligent, feisty lady who would bargain away her soul to get her hands on some of his antiquities. He holds Chloe captive - but this is not your usual captive damsel romance plot. Chloe is no damsel, believe me!<br /><br />There are plot twists, hilarious scenes that ooze with sexual tension and sensuality. Yum! The dialogue and banter between the two is outstanding! They eventually travel to Scotland because the book he has been searching for is not in America after all - but back home. There he meets with his brother and sister-in-law. Daegus had been avoiding his family because he feared their learning of his possession - knowledge which could lead to his death. And in Scotland the evil grows stronger.<br /><br />The \\"Tuatha De Dannan,\\" (a fairy type immortal race), had made a pact with the human race hundreds of years before.  The Keltar became the chosen to protect the earth, nourish it and rebuild the land. A compact was forged between the two races - man and fairy. Under extreme duress, Daegus was forced to break this pact and when he did, the 13 \\"Tuatha De Dannan,\\" who had broken away from the main group and turned to dark ways, possessed Daegus' mind, and eventually threatened his very soul. This is a very special and most unusual story.<br /><br />Ms. Moning has created a magical world where time has little meaning and lovers will cross centuries and continents to stay together. The author has included fascinating, accurate details of Celtic Druid lore and life. Her characters are three-dimensional and so likable. All I can say, to sum up, is that I read avidly - all kinds of books. This is one of my Top Ten favorites.

I recently bought the book for my cousin's 13 month-old little boy and he babbles, laughs, and overall expresses great pleasure when it is read to him - or when he reads it himself.

In a fun, humorous way, \\"Where Is Baby's Belly Button\\", (with your help), teaches baby to learn where his eyes, ears, hands, feet....and belly button are. At 13 months, this little boy is able to lift the flaps to find the answers. The flaps are very thin, so a smaller child may need some help. And most of all, the book is happy and oozes love.

And one also avoids bankruptcy this way.<br /><br />This amazing travel anthology includes 1000 man-made and natural wonders of the world, thus the book's title. Ms. Schultz has done her research thoroughly in order to guide the would-be world explorers without losing them. And this is one of the most user-friendly guides I have seen. A detailed and cross-referenced, subject-specific index lists such categories as Unrivaled Museums, Sacred Places, Festivals, Culinary Experiences, and gorgeous beaches - also, addresses, phone and fax numbers, web sites, costs, best times to visit.<br /><br />From Europe to Africa to Asia - to your wildest dreams, Patricia Schultz has selected the most extraordinary places which reflect \\"some sense of the earth's magic, integrity, wonder, and legacy.\\" The author's prose is as exciting as the sites she describes. And she discusses why each of her entries is worthy of your itinerary. Take a safari into Botswana's Okavango Delta, tour the covered souks of Aleppo, climb the Tuscan hills to San Gimignano, sail the seven seas with descriptions of exactly what to look for in each. Visit Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market, the Great Wall of China, Brazil's Ipanema beach, the Buddhas of Borobudur, Mesa Verde's cave dwellings, the Oaxaca Saturday market, Canyon de Chelly, the backwaters of Kerala, California's Monterey Peninsula, the Lewis and Clark Trail in Oregon, Alaska's Inside Passage, and the Alhambra in Andalusia. Splurge, just once, at Venice's Cipriani Hotel, the Hassler in Rome, or Paris's Crillon.<br /><br />Although one needs a \\"certain amount\\" of money to actually take these trips, there is information for every class of travel and accommodation - from the most elite to the most acceptably modest.

Authors Stewart O'Nan, William Styron, Kurt Vonnegut, Andre Dubus, Tobias Wolff, Richard Ford and Robert Stone, to name a few, have given the work of Richard Yates the highest praise and called him the \\"voice of a generation.\\"  He was once acclaimed as one of the most powerful, compassionate, and technically accomplished writers of America's postwar generation. Yates chronicled mainstream American life from the 1930s through the 1960s. Unfortunately, since his death in 1992, almost all of his work has gone out of print. Now \\"The Collected Stories of Richard Yates,\\" has been published to the delight of avid fans and lovers of good literature. Yates, called a \\"writers\\" writer,\\" deserves more. His prose is meant for a much wider audience. It is accessible, straightforward and wonderfully readable. The gathering together of these 27 brilliant, unsettling, and sometimes heartbreaking stories, filled with grim humor, is cause for celebration.<br /><br />Most of the stories are set in the 1940s and 50s but they feel like they were written for people in today's world. In one of my favorite stories, \\"Dr. Jack-o-lantern,\\" Vincent Sabella, a New York City kid with mossy teeth, from a poor neighborhood, moves to the suburbs. He obviously feels like the outsider he is, a state common to many of Yates' characters. He hears a classmate give a report on the movie \\"Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde\\" and uses his fertile imagination to invent a story about a film called \\"Dr. Jack-o-lantern.\\" Vincent delivers his report, an outlandish version of his classmate's, which is received with outbursts of laughter. His classmates call Vincent a dope and a liar. The reader, along with Vincent, enters what seems like a child's nightmare world. Yates' shows a tremendous understanding of the cruelty and terrors of childhood.<br /><br />Two working-class lovers realize that their problems won't be solved by their upcoming marriage in \\"The Best of Everything.\\" Yates' prose is flat here, like the lives of his characters. Hope and resignation permeate the piece. \\"She tried to sound excited, but it wasn't easy.\\" \\"Somehow he'd expected more of the Friday before his wedding.\\"<br /><br />In \\"The Builders,\\" one of the author's later stories, Robert Prentice, a beginning writer struggling to make ends meet, takes on a ghostwriting job for a New York cab driver. Bernie, the cabbie, contracts him to write true heartwarming stories from life.<br /><br />Richard Yates writes about middle class people and those who live life on the fringes, troubled kids, disgruntled veterans, lonely shop girls, frustrated suburban housewives, despondent white collar workers and the dark humor of life on a tuberculosis ward. He examines the failed American dream with tremendous compassion. This volume contains stories from Yates' other collections, \\"Eleven Kinds of Loneliness\\" and \\"Liars in Love,\\" as well as nine other stories, seven of which have not been previously published. Novelist Richard Russo writes a moving Introduction. This is an extraordinary anthology. Highly recommended.<br /><br />JANAis characters.

They reflect a Mexican cuisine that most Americans are unfamiliar with. We are talking \\"haute cuisine\\" from a family kitchen here - not mere chile con carne, enchiladas and tacos. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Victor M. Valle and his wife, Mary Lau Valle, have artfully compiled a treasure trove of recipes, along with a family history going back five generations, 19th century photographs, and journal entries to make a very special book, which was nominated for two 1996 Julia Child Cookbook Awards and a 1996 James Beard Award.<br /><br />The material used to compile \\"Recipe of Memory\\" is from an antique chest left to Sr. Valle by his great aunt, and dates back to 1888. There are over 50 very authentic recipes here which beautifully capture the varied tastes of Mexico, including: Rabbit in the Garden, Roast Leg of Lamb with Mole, Peas in Tablecloth-Staining Sauce, Chiles Stuffed with Shrimp, Squab on a Bed of Saffron Rice, Chiles Stuffed with Mincemeat with an Almond-Caper Dressing, Mango-Orange-Banana Ice Cream and Prickly Pear Sorbet. I lived in Mexico for many years and these recipes bring back memories of some wonderful meals savored at the homes of Mexican friends. You won't get this kind of food in a restaurant.<br /><br />In Mexico, as in many cultures, much that is important in family life revolves around the dining table. This extraordinary cookbook, cum social commentary, cum family history reflects this tradition. It makes a wonderful gift too!<br /><br />JANA	2004-08-08

She doesn't use formulas like many other romance writers. Her plots are complex and packed with adventure and action. While some of her storylines and characters' motivations strain one's credibility at times, I always allow her leeway, because her novels are so exciting. And her characters are colorful, unusual, and credible. The historical detail about the period is really interesting and well researched.<br /><br />\\"Love's Wild Desire\\" is set in New Orleans and Alhambra, a Louisiana plantation, owned by super-hunk Rafael Navarro. Catherine Mayfield, a spirited, aristocratic Creole beauty makes a poor decision when she agrees to accompany a friend to a quadroon ball one evening, a place where no lady would ever be seen. Navarro see her there and is immediately attracted. He mistakes her for a \\"lady of the night\\" and literally sweeps her off her feet. He carries her away to his townhouse and has his way with her, thereby ruining her reputation. Although there is another man who is willing to marry her, the fortune hunting Marcus Fitzgerald, (a nasty villain, disguised by a handsome face and a lying tongue), Rafael has his way - again. So, Catherine becomes Maitress of Alhambra and goes there to live with her husband.<br /><br />This is a period filled with danger for plantation owners, as slaves are rebelling and rioting throughout Louisiana Territory. Catherine feels the tension immediately with the house slaves. She also has problems with her young sister-in-law and her companion who dabbles in voodoo. Although she is very attracted to her husband, she is guarded with him, afraid to open herself emotionally. She is sure he only married her to save her reputation and she doesn't want to be hurt. Rafe, is also fearful of being hurt. So, the usual misunderstandings which take place when two people are not open with each other about their strong feelings, occur. As a consequence, Catherine gets herself into all kinds of trouble, even risking her own life on a few thrilling, chilling occasions.<br /><br />This is a real swashbuckler that will keep you reading well into the night.

This exhibition catalogue contains more than 300 color plates and approximately 200 additional illustrations of paintings and sculpture from a benchmark period in art history. The year nineteen hundred, the beginning of the 20th century, ushered in a period when art was truly at a crossroads. It was, at once, the beginning and the end of an era - the culmination of 19th century art and the beginning of a revolution. Salon artists, the academic realists, Rouault, Sargent, Whistler, and Homer, etc., were at their peak and their work was widely acclaimed. And painters, newly arrived on the scene, from Impressionists, Post-Impressionists to those who had yet to find a label for their work, like Cezanne, Matisse, Mondrian, Picasso, Kandinsky, Klimt and Gaugin, were beginning to discover new methods, new ideas, to express what they saw and felt. They learned from tradition and sought to escape it. These artists would  go on to change the way the Western world looked at art<br /><br />This compilation, the companion volume to a major international exhibit, provides an extraordinary visual history of that period. The quality of the reproductions, especially the color plates, is superb. Work by lesser known artists are displayed here, as well as paintings and sculptures by those whose names we recognize immediately. The book is organized into categories according to subject, i.e., bathers, nudes, self-portraits, still life and landscapes. This method of organization, similar to the concepts established by the French Academy in the 17th century, makes for some fascinating comparisons, i.e., an abstracted Degas nude alongside a classical nude by Carolus-Duran. Robert Rosenblum and Mary Anne Stevens purposely included a wide range of work completed at approximately the same time to reflect change - the wide variety of styles and techniques employed at this period by different artists.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book and a brilliant study of a pivotal point in European art history. There is a 70 page section of artists' biographies at the catalogue's conclusion.<br /><br />JANAbeautiful book and a brilliant study of a pivotal point in European art history.

I have read many books about the Romanov family over the years. Rosemary and Donald Crawford's &quot;Michael and Natasha : The Life And Love Of Michael II, The Last Of The Romanov Tsars&quot; is one of the best - certainly the most riveting. Although very well researched, documented and indexed, the book reads like a wonderful novel. It is an extraordinarily moving love story and gives the reader a bird's eye view into the lives of the Romanovs and the fall of their dynasty.<br /><br /> Grand Duke Michael, was the dashing youngest brother of the last Tsar of Russia. The book chronicles Michael's early life, giving a detailed account of his relationship with his family. He became involved with Natalia, (or Natasha) Cheremetevskaya, a commoner, while he was serving in the imperial army. She was 26, quite beautiful, and captured Michael's heart during their first dance. Natasha was twice divorced and was widely dismissed as a scheming social climber. Michael's romantic courtship of Natasha, their extremely close relationship, morganatic marriage and banishment from Russia is all documented here, along with observations by friends, family and actual letters. There are also never-before-seen photographs. Apparently Grand Duchess Olga, Michael's sister, not only knew Natasha, but evidently was a friend. Some of the unusual photographs in the book document this friendship. After the couple married, Olga turned her back on them. When Tsar Nicholas II abdicated, and abdicated for his young son, Michael was offered the throne, but he refused the opportunity to rule Russia because society and the Russian people would never have accepted his wife. There exists the possibility that if Michael had accepted the crown, there may have never been a Bolshevik Revolution.<br /><br /> One of the most fascinating books on the period that I have read. It is a powerful and tragic story and I highly recommend it.<br /><br /> JANA	2004-08-03

There are many reasons for the author's avid following and universal appeal in the 21st century. I think almost everyone will agree that her writing is witty, perceptive and very revealing about middle class English society in the 19th century. I am a true blue Austin fan, but you don't have to be in order to enjoy Karen Joy Fowler's &quot;The Jane Austen Book Club.&quot; I do think, however, that the reader should be familiar with Ms. Austen's work in order to understand the allusions in this novel, and how the characters relate to those who people Austen's books.<br /><br /> Six women and one man meet monthly over a six month period to discuss Jane Austen's novels. They make up the Central Valley/River City, (CA), all-Jane-Austen-all-the-time book club. Each of the characters has &quot;a private Austen.&quot; Jocelyn had come up with the idea for the book club. She devotes most of her time to running a kennel and breeding Rhodesian Ridgebacks. Like Ms. Austen, Jocylyn had never married. She is in her early 50s, very creative and has seemingly boundless energy. Her closest friend, Sylvia, another member, has just been abandoned by her husband of 32 years. Jocelyn had introduced the two in high school. She may actually have started the club to keep Sylvia occupied during this difficult time in her life. Sylvia's Austen is a practical woman, although she is open to love. Allegra, Sylvia's daughter, who insists on referring to herself as a lesbian in most conversations, is 30, stylish and sexy. She focuses on Ms. Austen's female characters and their financial dependency on men. Bernadette, an eccentric woman in her late 60s, has announced that she doesn't look in the mirror anymore. This becomes obvious as the plot and characters develop. Her favorite book is &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; but the group postpones reading it because Jocelyn does not want to subject Sylvia to the &quot;dishy Mr. Darcy,&quot; while she is in the middle of a divorce. Prudie, the group's youngest member at 28, is also the only one who is married. She teaches high school French, and her favorite novel is the somber &quot;Persuasion,&quot; Austen's last novel. Grigg, a 40-something, attractive, bachelor, has to deal with some initial, perhaps unconscious hostility, as the only male. He hosts the club meeting when they read &quot;Northhanger Abbey,&quot; his favorite.<br /><br /> &quot;The Jane Austen Book Club&quot; is more a character study than an action or plot driven work. We follow the characters' lives over a 6 month period, observe how they deal with love, loss, interact with each other and interpret Austen's work through their own individual experiences.<br /><br /> The author, a PEN/Faulkner award finalist for &quot;Sister Noon,&quot; has written an intelligent, modern-day social comedy, whose characters demonstrate similarities to Ms. Austen's, with all their foibles and follies.

I have read all her books and, to different degrees, have enjoyed each one. So it comes as no surprise that I found her latest offering, &quot;A Perfect Match,&quot; to be a gripping novel that held me spellbound until the last page. It is a dark, complex, beautifully written novel with a storyline presented from various points of view. The characters are three-dimensional and compelling, even the little boy. Ms. Picoult wrote that she drew much from her children's conversations to form the character and thoughts of young Nathaniel.<br /><br /> Nina Frost is an assistant district attorney in Biddeford, Maine. She prosecutes child molesters. Nina works ardently to put them behind bars, but there are many loopholes in the legal system that frustrate most of her attempts to seek justice for the small victims of these heinous crimes. Nina is also a wife and mother, roles she loves but feels she doesn't make enough time for in her busy schedule. She adores her husband Caleb, and their son, Nathaniel, is the light of her life. Nina had always thought she was sterile due to an ovarian operation years before, so when she became pregnant she and Caleb were deliriously happy. When Nathaniel was born, she felt as if all her dreams had come true. Indeed, they had. He is a wonderful, curious, intelligent, energetic five-year-old.<br /><br /> One morning Nathaniel stops talking. He remains mute, and the Frosts, extremely concerned, take him to a doctor where they find that their son has been raped. Now Nina and her family are the victims. Roles have been reversed on her. The role her clients usually play now belongs to her son. She is not the prosecutor in this case. She is the mother. But her experience and knowledge remain that of a prosecutor. And the conflicts she experiences are one of the book's focal points. Her beloved boy has been badly hurt, traumatized. Her family is shattered. And she knows exactly how the legal system will deal with them when they seek justice.<br /><br /> &quot;Perfect Match&quot; is much more than a suspense thriller. Nor is this just a story of sexual abuse against children, or just a novel about how one family copes with a terrible crisis. Ms. Picoult raises issues of morality here, of the thin line, at times, between right and wrong - and about how far a mother should go to protect her child.<br /><br /> There are occasional holes in the logic, but I just considered &quot;author's license&quot; and didn't let these small flaws bother me or impede my overall enjoyment.<br /><br /> JANAdeal with them when they seek justice. <br />  <br /> &quot;Perfect Match&quot; is much more than a suspense thriller.

Bush's Presidency	There is a veritable plethora of political books on the market this election year. However, Senator Robert C. Byrd's, (D-W.Va.), is totally unique, given the author's background and point of view. &quot;Loosing America: Confronting a Reckless and Arrogant Presidency&quot; is a searing indictment of George W. Bush's Presidency by a man who served under 11 US Presidents - beginning with Harry Truman. Senator Byrd's Congressional career, in both houses, has spanned more than 50 years. Only 2 other members of Congress had a longer tenure. He has held more leadership positions in the U.S. Senate than any other Senator of any party in Senate history. Sometimes called &quot;the conscience of the Senate,&quot; this octogenarian patriot has dedicated his life to public service, and is considered to have a scholar's understanding of constitutional government. He is also the author of a four-volume history of the U.S. Senate<br /><br /> As much as I like and respect the Senator, I would never have bought and read his book if I had not heard him interviewed on TV last week. I thought I had read more than enough political memoirs this year. However, I heard Senator Byrd discuss the President's handling of the Iraqi War, other administration policies and attitudes, and the separation of powers, (a very important issue for me), and I realized I was, in fact, hearing some new information from a fresh perspective - information that I found extremely disturbing. I wanted to learn more.<br /><br /> Yes, this is a partisan senator's point of view. Is there any other kind? Are we to disbelieve all members of the loyal opposition, no matter what their record? I do think Senator Byrd very much wanted to support the president, indeed he reached out to do so, after the Inauguration and after September 11, 2001. He has a long history of working effectively with both Republican and Democratic administrations. However, things began to sour with what he saw as the &quot;slow unraveling of the people's liberties.&quot; He believes that dangerous legislation was rushed through Congress, based on false information. Byrd was one of 21 senators who did not vote for the October 2002 resolution that authorized the use force to topple Saddam Hussein. He says that his Senate colleagues &quot;stood passively mute...paralyzed by our own uncertainty, seemingly stunned by the sheer turmoil of events.&quot;<br /><br /> The Senator goes beyond criticizing the present government's preemptive strike, lack of post war planning and national security in general. He strongly condemns President Bush and his administration for their overall secrecy and &quot;contempt for the balance of powers,&quot; what he sees as the erosion of constitutionally mandated separation of powers. He sees Bush and his advisers - Cheney, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Perle, Wolfowitz, etc., as dangerous, not only because of their &quot;ill conceived&quot; policies, but because they are intent on usurping the powers of the &quot;the People's Branch of Government, Congress.&quot;<br /><br /> Senator Byrd argues his points well and backs them up with clear examples, and by describing encounters and discussions with President Bush, himself. They are quite similar to accounts reported by other recent political authors like Richard Clark, Paul O'Neill and Bob Woodward. G. W. Bush was quoted in Woodward's recent book as saying, &quot;I do not need to explain why I say things. That's the interesting thing about being the president. Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something, but I don't feel like I owe anybody an explanation.&quot; That quote literally makes Byrd's hair stand on end. &quot;Such hubris,&quot; he says. &quot;Unmitigated arrogance. He's talking about the people here. That one little paragraph explains better than I could ever explain the contempt this man shows for the sovereignty of the people of this country.&quot;<br /><br /> This is a compelling and credible book. Occasionally theSenator takes too long to make his points, especially when comparing Bush with his predecessors...but he certainly does make them well. Ultimately he rallies all Americans, calling for the people to regain their Constitution, to return to the values and processes that made America great, and to speak the truth and demand the truth from our nation's leaders. BRAVO!<br /><br /> JANAccasionally the Senator takes too long to make his points, especially when comparing Bush with his predecessors...but he certainly does make them well.

The League of Nations had given Britain a provisional mandate to govern the tiny parcel of desert, and the United Kingdom was publicly committed to the founding of a Jewish State. In reality, they frequently aroused the wrath of the Jewish pioneers by placating the Arab community. Meanwhile, the Zionists in America, England and Palestine were amassing money, weapons and political opinion with the purpose of creating their nation. Orthodox Jews, however, caused significant dissent, believing only God, and the arrival of the Messiah, could re-create the Jewish State. It is against this tinderbox that author Jonathan Wilson sets &quot;A Palestine Affair.&quot;<br /><br /> The novel opens with a murder. This is, after all, a historical mystery. Artist Mark Bloom, a new arrival to Jerusalem, walks into his garden one night, and a man, dressed in a djellaba and kaffiyeh, stumbles toward him and falls into his arms. It turns out that the victim was an Orthodox Jew, not an Arab, who had been beaten and stabbed to death. The violent incident stirs up disturbing feelings in Mark which bring back memories of the battlefield.<br /><br /> Bloom, a nonobservant British Jew and his American wife, Joyce, came to Palestine because the artist had been commissioned by a Zionist organization to paint &quot;Life Under Reconstruction Conditions. Progress. Enterprise. Development.&quot; He perishes at the thought. Bloom had just bombed at his last exhibit in London and needs the money. He is depressed, but had been self-involved, withdrawn and depressed for years, long before the recent death of his mother. &quot;The forty-five-year-old mummy's boy,&quot; believes, &quot;love had been stolen away by death.&quot; Joyce cannot be a happy woman, nor theirs a happy marriage. Right? She had immersed herself in the Zionist cause while in England, and is looking forward to participating in the movement, which has so inspired her, now that she is in Palestine.<br /><br /> Captain Robert Kirsch, a Jewish detective, is assigned to investigate the crime. As such, he enters the Blooms' life. Mark becomes more withdrawn as the investigation progresses. Joyce and Robert fall passionately in love. Mark can't blame the neglected Joyce, but is jealous anyway. Meanwhile both Arabs and Jews seem content to be rid of the dead man, who was rumored to be having an affair with an Arab youth. As Robert gets closer to finding the killer, his own government sabotages his progress, in order to keep the peace. Riots could easily start if the murderer is discovered to be either Arab or Jew.<br /><br /> Wilson writes a tight, complex tale. His character development is superb. Murder, politics, sex, history and the world of art - nothing remotely boring here. The author himself paints such a vivid portrait of Jerusalem, and the surrounding area, that it is easily visualized in the mind's eye. An excellent read!

There was a time when I could pickup a novel by Karen Robards and, without perusing it, know that I could be assured of a terrific read. No more. The penultimate book I read by Ms. Robards, (&quot;Island Flame&quot;), was somewhat disappointing, but I remained a loyal fan. What's one mediocre novel after so many good ones? A friend gave me a copy of &quot;Beachcomber&quot; last week. Well, this novel is so far below the author's considerable talents that I am beginning to wonder if she has hit a major rough spot.<br /><br /> The plot and characters remind me of the satiric comedy film starring Michelle Pfeiffer, &quot;Married To The Mob,&quot; (It came out about 10 years ago & is quite good), except this is not supposed to be either satire or comedy. The characters are caricatures. Our heroine, Christy Petrino, has been raised in south Jersey, in a neighborhood inhabited by the mafia...mob...organized bad guys. Her deceased father was a minor mobster. So is her mother's boyfriend, Uncle Vince, and most of their friends and associates. Wanting to get away from all these friendly family criminals, Christy studies law and when she passes the bar, she gets a terrific job with DePalma and Lowery, a top Philadelphia law firm. She and Michael DePalma, (her boss), fall in love, become engaged and then she discovers he is a &quot;made man.&quot; Oh, and the firm is also a mob cover. Such a smart girl...what a coincidence! So she quits her job and breaks off with Michael, who she thinks might kill her for &quot;knowing too much.&quot; Ahhh, trust and love! This lady is not too on the ball! Anyway, Christy goes off to vacation on Ocracoke Island, the Outer Banks, to get away from it all. The cottage on the island where she stays belongs to, you guessed it, her mobster relatives. And her next door neighbors - more of same. Her Uncle Vince has assured her that she will be safe from DePalma and associates if she only does them one little favor. She is to drop off a briefcase, contents unknown, to an island motel. She agrees, and after doing the deed comes upon a gruesome murder - which appears to be one of many. A serial killer is on the loose and is aware she might be a witness to the crime. By the way, there's a big, hunky surfer dude next door to her cottage, who just happens to be an FBI agent monitoring her every move - so he can catch the recipient of the briefcase and Michale DePalma. He gets to watch her live her life through a hidden camera. What a way to get one's kicks!<br /><br /> This romanric thriller is all too predictable from the start. The characters are one dimensional. The dialogue is too funny, at times, to be taken seriously. I didn't feel any real heat or chemistry between Mr. FBI or Christy...but maybe I was too bored by the time they met.<br /><br /> I don't mean to be harsh. Ms. Robards has supplied me with hours of entertainment and reading pleasure over the years. However, I will be more careful now when buying her books. If anyone wants to read Robards at her best, try &quot;Dark of the Moon,&quot; &quot;Tiger's Eye,&quot; &quot;Hunter's Moon,&quot; etc.. There are so many good ones.

I have become addicted to this series and plan to read all twenty-four books.<br /><br /> The year is 1861. Abraham Lincoln has just been inaugurated as President of the United States. But the Union is breaking apart. States are seceding one by one, and a devastating War is about to begin. The Comstock Lode, the richest lode of silver ever found by prospectors, has been discovered near Virginia City, Nevada. The President has enlisted Major General Lee Blake, to carryout an urgent mission. He must ensure that the overland transport of millions of dollars of silver reaches the Union lines safely.<br /><br /> Lincoln and his generals are worried about financing an expensive war. The British are quietly aiding the Confederacy. Britain has made great strides with the Industrial Revolution. Cotton from the South will assure a continuance of their burgeoning economy. The Nevada silver, and gold from California and Colorado, are desperately needed to pay for munitions, uniforms, weapons and food. Whip Holt, Blake's dear friend and colleague from the days of the Oregon Trail, is called out of retirement, his commission as full Colonel reactivated, to assist Blake in this dangerous assignment.<br /><br /> This is one of my favorite books in the series. It is certainly one of the most exciting. The train bearing the silver bullion is sabotaged by British agents and captured by the Confederates. Both the capture and outcome are absolutely thrilling. Many of the characters from the former novels appear here and they continue to grow and develop, while a new generation, born on the Pacific coast, begins to assume responsibilities as they come of age.<br /><br /> The history, characters, plot and subplots in this novel are some of the best so far.

It is a story of family relationships, friendship, betrayal, guilt and atonement. Mr. Hosseini also explores, movingly, the horrors of war and the terrible conflicts between classes and ethnic groups that have long plagued the people of Afghanistan. The novel spans the period in Afghani history from the peaceful 70's to the rule of the Taliban in the late 1990's.<br />In Kabul, during the winter of 1975, Amir's life changed forever. Those were the last peaceful days of Afghanistan's monarchy. Amir, our young narrator, is the privileged son of a wealthy Pashtun businessman. They are Sunni Muslims. Totally unlike his father, (called Baba, the \\"Toophan agha\\" or \\"Mr. Hurricane\\"), Amir is very sensitive, introspective, and much more interested in poetry and literature than in football. His mother died giving birth to him and the boy struggles to win his father's affection. Hassan was the closest person to Amir and his constant playmate, but they were not quite friends. The two boys had nursed at the breast of the same wet nurse - a special bond to the Afghanis. They were virtually inseparable. They climbed trees, wandered the streets of Kabul, made mischief, shared secrets, ran kites, and Amir would read while Hassan listened avidly to the wonderful stories. \\"The Shahnamah,\\" a 10th century epic of ancient Persian heroes, was Hassan's favorite. He was an illiterate servant and his father was Amir's father's servant. They are Sh'ia Muslim, Hazaras. During a kite flying tournament in the winter of Amir's twelfth year, he betrayed Hassan - a defining event that will haunt him always. He will spend the rest of his life trying to atone. The Soviet invasion caused Amir and his father to emigrate to the United States, leaving everything and everyone behind. However, Amir will have another opportunity to prove his loyalty to his childhood friend and gain forgiveness. The story revolves around Amir's internal struggle.<br />Mr. Hosseini's characters literally come alive on the page. Their emotional struggles and triumphs moved me deeply. Amir, Hassan, Baba, Ali, and Rahim Khan are so credible that I really became attached to them and miss them, now that I have turned the book's last page. The narrative is beautifully written, poignant, and also very informative about an Afghanistan most foreigners have never seen. Khaled Hosseini is an Afghan &eacute;migr&eacute; living in San Francisco. I look forward to his next book.

Various peoples of Turkic, Iranian and South Asian origins surround the rugged central Hindu Kush mountain range, but no single group absolutely dominates the nation known as Afghanistan. To the south and east of the Hindu Kush, live approximately 6.5 million Pashtun. They make-up the predominate population of the capital, Kabul, major cities like Jalalabad, Khost and Kandahar, and are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims. Virtually all Taliban are Pashtun. Dominating the mountainous northeast of the country are the Tajiks, numbering around 3.5 million within Afghanistan. They are the most powerful group in the Northern Alliance, and are mostly Sunni Muslims. Ethnic hatred and rivalries have existed between these two groups for centuries. \\"Winter In Kandahar,\\" deals, in part, with the struggle between the Tajik and Pashtun, and a diabolical plot involving potential genocide.<br /><br />Author Steven E. Wilson begins his extraordinary story in late August 2001, in Taloqan, Afghanistan. A young Tajik Mujaheddin, Ahmed Jan, lost his uncle, as he lost his father before him, in a battle with Taliban forces. Ahmed fights with the Northern Alliance and was ordered to report to Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud at the Khoje Bahauddin base on the Amu Dar'ya River. He reached Massoud in time to be present for the Commander's assassination by al Qaeda terrorists posing as TV journalists. The Lion of Panjshir was dead. The date was September 9, 2001.<br /><br />Three months later, Ahmed Jan reports to elderly Mullah Habid in Kabul. The aging cleric holds a position of leadership with the Tajiks and the Alliance. During a brief period of captivity by the Taliban, the month before, Jan had discovered papers written in Arabic with information about a new, deadly biological weapon. His captors were overtaken and Jan escaped with the papers. The mullah and the young warrior read that the new weapon is to be delivered in Venice during Carnevale. A plan was also outlined to spread the pestilence in Panjsjit, among the Tajik population. Mullah Habid makes Ahmed Jan the leader of a mission to Amsterdam, which will eventually take him to Italy and America in pursuit of the deadly substance. Accompanying him are two men, Mustafa and Mohammedjan, who are to assist him in every way. They all have appropriate, falsified documents, passports and replacement papers, to use if needed. They are given a credit card and plenty of money to bribe their way through the Khyber Pass to Islamabad where they will catch a plane to the Netherlands. They are specifically told not to go to the Americans, who are \\"consumed with their own concerns.\\"<br /><br />Ahmed Jan and his countryman are in constant danger on this mission to save his people from ethnic cleansing. They are pursued by al Qaeda and the CIA. This is not just another predictable novel where the bad guys chase the good ones and, after a crisis and denouement, everyone lives happily, etc.. Jan has a medical background, having studied in Saudi Arabia before his country's last war, and comes up with an alternate use for the weapon of terror. The introduction of some scientific material, about genetics, is fascinating and adds much to the storyline. The ending, like the rest of the book, is powerful.<br /><br />The characters are also extremely well developed and give the reader remarkable insight into their culture and customs. The men are all credible. The women are not as strong. There are three major romances, one for Ahmed Jan, and one for each comrade. Although I enjoyed the romantic aspect of the novel, three for three is a bit hokey. The narrative is well written, as is the dialogue, especially between the Tajiks.<br /><br />I really enjoyed \\"Winter In Kandahar\\" and look forward to Mr. WIlson's next book.

Dana Fuller Ross' panoramic saga of America's great expansion into the western territories is some of the most intelligent, well written historic fiction I have read. &quot;Colorado&quot; is Book 7 in a series of 24 novels which truly bring history to life during one of the United States' most important and fascinating periods.<br />In 1858, some eight years after the beginning of the California Gold Rush, gold was discovered in the Colorado country. Once again, it was boom or bust as hoards of gold-hungry men swarmed to Colorado, bringing with them many of the same problems that had plagued California before it became a US territory. The North and South were drifting further apart, endangering the Union. The issues went far beyond free vs. slave states. The increasingly industrialized North and the predominantly agricultural South had been developing opposing views on almost every aspect of what constituted US society.<br />General Leland Blake, a veteran of the first wagon train to blaze the Oregon Trail, was called to Washington by President Buchanan. The gold, discovered by southerners from Georgia, was found in the wilderness of Colorado, a place claimed by no state or territory. Geological reports favored finding considerable gold within the next year. The President wanted to secure Colorado country for the Union. He also needed to know approximately how much gold was available. If Civil War broke out, the gold would be of great value to finance the conflict and help to secure a Union victory. Buchanan sends Blake to Colorado with a geologist, both men's wives, and a lawyer. Since the southerners are not to know of the presidential mission, it is to be kept absolutely secret. Blake is to pose as a retired General. His group is supposed to be on a financial expedition to assess Colorado's mineral wealth for future investment.<br />Many of the characters from the first six books appear in &quot;Colorado&quot; and new ones, both historical and fictitious, are introduced. The author gives these characters tremendous depth and illustrates how life in the new land, along with new responsibilities, changes them and effects their relationships. Chet Harris, another wagon train veteran, goes to Colorado along with his partner Wong Ke, to see if they can repeat the mining success they had in California, where they made their fortune. They join with newspaper publisher Wade Fulton, of the Colorado Tribune, to form a voluntary citizen's constabulary to provide law and order. Colorado promised to be as bad as California was, in terms of violence, crime and murder. Lovely Susanna Fulton, Wade's daughter and newspaper editor, solves the mystery of the &quot;Grey Ghost bandit.&quot; Lt. Andrew Brandon, son of the Oregon Trail wagon train master Sam Brandon, and many others also have a part to play in &quot;Colorado.&quot;<br />The history, characters, plot and subplots in this novel are some of the most exciting and dynamic so far. I love history, and while I have read and studied this period in America's development, I have learned so much from reading these seven &quot;Wagons West&quot; books.

I usually buy or borrow her books as soon as they come on the market knowing that I will enjoy an entertaining read. \\"Dark Horse,\\" however, is not a dark horse. This one comes in close to last on my list of winning titles. The plot plods. That pretty much says it all. And it plods for 557 pages. I specifically marked the page where I became somewhat interested - page 272. I did so because I had faith in the author and was determined to finish the novel. It was hard going. There's too much padding here and not enough mystery.<br />Elena Estes, a ballsy Florida narcotics detective took too many risks. She jumped the proverbial gun during a stakeout and her actions cost her partner's life, her own health and her career. Years later, after much surgery and physical therapy, Elena is back on her feet but still feeling pretty down and out. She is approached by a 12 year-old girl, Molly Seabright, and asked to find her missing older sister. The sister was working as a horse groomer among Palm Beach's rich and famous when suddenly she disappeared. Molly knows Elena through an equestrian magazine where her picture is displayed prominently along with the information that she is a private investigator. Elena, Molly, Molly's sister, and just about everyone in the novel are involved in equestrian competition, as is the author. One of the reasons I thought the plot would be fascinating is because in the \\"Author's Note\\" Ms. Hoag implies she will write about the equestrian sport of dressage. She does not deliver. She does write about people involved in the sport and in international horse breeding. I hope she has exaggerated her characterizations as most of the folks who populate this mystery are despicable people. She could, unintentionally, give the sport a bad name. I mean, aren't there any good guys? Her characters are not three dimensional. They are either good or evil, with no gradations.<br />I don't recommend \\"Dark Horse,\\" even if you are, as I am, a fan of Tami Hoag.

She loves learning about different cultures and living outside the US, but has grown uncomfortable with what she perceives to be a growing fanaticism and lack of tolerance in the world - even in France. Celia has become increasingly fascinated with one of her students, a 19-year-old Iranian, Mehdi Asquari. He is sensitive, handsome and amazingly mature. Mehdi's father, deceased, was a Muslim. His mother, Ester, a Jewess, is in prison in Hamadan, Iran, the burial place of the Biblical Queen Esther, for writing provocative journalism. Hers was a woman's voice in a male dominated society.<br />As Mehdi's and Celia's relationship becomes intimate, he talks more about his mother, whose story intrigues Celia. She creates a book-like journal where she combines fiction, fantasy and fact to parallel the contemporary Ester and the Old Testament Persian Queen Esther, and finds both strength and defiance in these two women. The biblical Esther had to hide her Judaism from King Xerxes I, (King Ahasuerus in Hebrew), and his court in order to survive. Mehdi's mother had to convert to Islam to marry but, in her heart, remains true to her people and religion. She maintains her cover as a Muslim after her husband's death, to help the Iranian Jews. Efforts are made to free Ester and bring her to France to join her children.<br />Mehdi has a twin sister Zahra, also studying in France, who does everything she can to deny her Iranian heritage, including dye her hair blonde and pretend to be Italian. Their relationship is fraught with tension and secrets, which eventually put Mehdi's life at risk. Celia cannot fathom how Zahra and Medhi navigate life as Muslims, Jews and Iranians living in an intolerant world.<br />Louise Domaratius's prose is elegant, lyrical and intense. She intertwines biblical passages with her narrative, giving it additional scope and illustrating incidents of intolerance and evil, as well as good, in ancient times as well as the present. The unusual love story is told with depth and delicacy. I wish that her writing was tighter.

The story of Queen Esther is one of the most exciting parts of the Old Testament/Tanakh. The journey of the orphaned Jewish girl chosen in a nationwide beauty contest to become the wife of Xerxes I, and Queen of Persia, who ultimately saves her people from annihilation, is extraordinary. It emphasizes the miracle of Jewish survival over the millennia and is rich in religious significance. I found this novel somewhat flawed and not powerful enough to do justice to this great story. However, Ms. Kohn's narrative, although it deviates from the original story, is fluid and she does entertain and inform. For these reasons I believe the book is worth reading<br />Many have compared &quot;The Gilded Chamber&quot; to Anita Diamant's &quot;The Red Tent.&quot; The only similarities I find are that both books deal with important women from the Old Testament. Ms. Diamant's novel of Dinah, Jacob's only daughter, is powerful, gritty, earthy, tragic and extremely original. There is little written in the Bible about Dinah, so much of the novel is based on the author's creativity and imagination. Rebecca Kohn's novel of Queen Esther, is a somewhat literal retelling of The Book Of Esther, although the role of Mordechai is much less significant here. Oddly, Mordechai is Esther's unrequited love interest, rather than her uncle. I don't understand the role change, as it really doesn't enhance the story. Why does Esther continue to have romantic feelings about the seemingly asexual Mordechai - especially when he does not reciprocate her feelings? Also, I would think that the historical Esther would have had to have been an extremely strong woman to accomplish what she did, let alone to survive in the court of Xerxes. Kohn's Esther comes across as a woman of little depth. She is subservient, dependent, and docile much of the time. I was unable to determine what her feelings were for her husband, Xerxes.<br />Much of &quot;The Gilded Chamber&quot; is set in a harem and affords the reader with a glimpse of life among the pampered concubines. I thought Esther's experience living amongst a group of women, confined to closed quarters, to be somewhat superficial. There is much emphasis on luxurious beauty treatments, silks and other finery, lavish jewelry, and occasional power struggles and little about relationships or about what the queen did on a daily basis beside beautify herself. What did she think? What did she do that had meaning - before and after she pled for the lives of her people?<br /><br />While many  of the main characters are Jewish, no one seems particularly devout not do they observe Jewish laws. Mordechai is not a practicing Jew and he encourages Esther to follow his lead in this. The characters are very one dimensional - the good are very, very good, and the bad are just plain evil. I would have liked the author to have given them much more depth.<br />That said, I do recommend reading &quot;The Gilded Chamber&quot; because, as I wrote earlier, it's a great story and Ms. Kohn writes it well.<br />JANAile much of the time.

Dana Fuller Ross' novels of America's great expansion into the western territories is some of the most intelligent, well written and well researched historic fiction I have read. &quot;California&quot; is Book 6 in a series of 24 novels which truly bring history to life during one of the United States' most important and fascinating periods.<br />When the United States acquired California, settlers moved to the new territory at a rate faster than Texas or Oregon ever experienced. Eventual statehood was a given. Then in 1848 gold was discovered near Fort Sutter in California's Sacramento Valley. Americans and people from all over the world, infected with &quot;gold fever,&quot; converged on California. Many of those seeking instant wealth were lawless rabble, outlaws. The flood of immigrants to California that began in late 1848 became a tidal wave as the great Gold Rush gathered force. Before 1849 ended, more than one hundred thousand newcomers would arrive, most of them single men, and more than 75% of them Americans.<br />Brigadier General Leland Blake was assigned to command a garrison of twelve hundred men at San Francisco's Presidio. He and his wife Cathy were veterans of the first wagon train to forge the Oregon Trail. His new job was more than difficult. Saloons and houses of prostitution flourished in the boom towns. There were not enough police or soldiers to enforce the law. Vigilance committees were formed as riots broke out and the rate of murder, robbery and general crime increased. California's permanent settlers, for whom the real gold was the produce they received from working the land, found that their lives were endangered as men, failing in their search for gold and starving from lack of food and money, plundered the countryside.<br />Many of the characters from the first five books appear in &quot;California&quot; and new ones, both historical and fictitious, are introduced. The author gives these characters tremendous depth and illustrates how life in the new land, along with new responsibilities, changes them and effects their relationships. Former Texas Ranger Rick Miller, now Sheriff of Sacramento Valley, tries to bring law and order to his new home and is driven by a need for vengeance against the men who destroyed his family. Lovely Melissa Austen, another who made the trip across the Oregon Trail, is forced into a life of prostitution. Whip Holt, his wife and many others also have a part to play in &quot;California.&quot;<br />The history, characters, plot and subplots in this novel are some of the most exciting and dynamic so far.

Dana Fuller Ross' novels of America's great expansion into the western territories is some of the most intelligent, well written and well researched historic fiction I have read. &quot;Texas&quot; is Book 5 in a series of 24 novels which truly bring history to life in a panoramic saga of one of the United States' most important and fascinating periods.<br />By 1844 the pioneers who forged the Oregon Trail were well established in Oregon Territory. Various wagon trains had followed their lead and the American population in the Pacific Northwest began to grow at an amazing rate. The new settlers' farms, ranches, offices, boatyards, orchards and lumber mills were thriving. Men like the aging former President Andrew Jackson, Sam Houston, President of the Republic of Texas, future US President James K. Polk, Majority Leader of the US Senate, Andrew Johnson and President John Tyler planned to fulfill America's &quot;manifest destiny&quot; - the belief that America had a God-given right, or destiny, to expand the country's borders from &quot;sea to shining sea.&quot; Their priorities were to settle the Oregon boundary dispute with Great Britain and admit Texas to the Union.<br />Rallying to the cause of Texas liberty from Mexico, volunteers from Oregon left their homes and joined the Texas Rangers, built the Texas navy, consented to repeat their arduous journey across the American continent and traveled east to lead wagon trains of new settlers to Texas. The United States sent wagon loads of rifles, guns and ammunition to assist the Texans, and finally the new state of Texas joined the Union as the nation's 28th state. The Mexican American War, which followed, culminated in US victory. The Texas boundary was set at the Rio Grande, and the US also bought New Mexico Province and what was called Upper California from the Mexicans. And the US/Oregon border with Great Britain was finally established at the 49th parallel.<br />Many of the characters from the first four books appear in &quot;Texas&quot; and new ones, both historical and fictitious, are introduced. Colonel Leland Blake and his wife Cathy leave their home in Oregon temporarily when they are given charge of the huge new wagon train to Texas. Danny Taylor and Chet Harris, who were adolescents on the Oregon Trail, both volunteer for the Texas Rangers to fight under their idol Captain Rick Miller. Harry Canning, another Oregon veteran, goes to Texas to put his boat building skills to use. The author gives these characters tremendous depth and illustrates how settling in the new land, along with new responsibilities, changes them and effects their relationships and lives.<br />The history, characters, plot and subplots in &quot;Texas&quot; are some of the most exciting and dynamic in the series.

(Wagons West, No. 4)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Reaching Oregon And Beyond - Superb Historical Fiction!	&quot;Oregon&quot; is Book 4 of Dana Fuller Ross' magnificent &quot;Wagons West&quot; series and every bit as exciting and well written as the first three books. If you are a fan of historical fiction and/or the frontier days in the American West, then you will thoroughly enjoy this series of 24 books. (This is a review for the Unabridged version of &quot;Oregon&quot;).<br /><br />The first wagon train to cross the American continent and forge the Oregon Trail was now on its last leg of the journey west. Having wintered in the Rocky Mountains, the pioneers, numbering over 500, set out for the Oregon Territory. They had survived natural catastrophes, vicious Indian attacks, internal feuds, illness, as well as sabotage by agents employed by Great Britain and Russia who were determined to see the venture fail. Every member of the traveling community had much at stake. Many had lost everything they owned in the Panic of 1837. Oregon Territory was a vast land where there were almost limitless forests and fish and game were abundant. The rich earth was perfect for farming. The journey was financed by the US government and financiers like John Jacob Astor. The new settlers had each been promised a tract of 600 acres to begin life anew in the West.<br /><br />Michael &quot;Whip&quot; Holt, and his blood brother, Cherokee warrior Stalking Horse led the train. They had been joined in Independence, Missouri by Lieutenant Colonel Lee Blake, the US Army's leading counterintelligence expert. He had been sent by President Martin Van Buren to help protect the wagon train from the British and Russian saboteurs. Russia and Great Britain were vying with the US for possession of the Oregon Territory. Both Holt and Blake, as well as many others, had married pioneer women they met during the trip.<br /><br />On a lush green plain, at the juncture of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers, the wagon train came to its final halt. To the west and south lay vast expanses of forest, to the east were the hills that rose to form the Cascade Range, to the north, directly across the Columbia, was Fort Vancouver with the Union Jack fluttering in the breeze. Many weeks would pass before sites for homes, farms, ranches, offices, boatyards and lumber mills would be selected, the land cleared and buildings erected - but the settlers had arrived at last.<br />The author, writing with intelligence and depth, vividly brings history to life in &quot;Oregon,&quot; as in the other books in the series. And the politics behind the settling of the West are fascinating. The plot becomes even more intriguing as the pioneers settle-in. New relationships are forged, the strife continues between England, Russia and the US, and a group of Russian immigrants joins the community. As one would expect, the novel is chock-full of adventure, hardship, courage, love, loss, tragedy and triumph. Many details have been taken from actual diaries and journals of early pioneers. These &quot;Wagons West&quot; novels are among the best historical fiction I have read.

(This is a review for the Unabridged version of &quot;Wyoming&quot;).<br />The first wagon train to cross the American continent and forge the Oregon Train reached the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in the autumn of 1938. Over 500 weary pioneers considered themselves lucky if they traveled more than 10 miles per day. They found a safe valley in the Wyoming country where they could spend their second winter together before attempting the last leg of their journey to Oregon Territory. They had survived Indian attacks, floods, sabotage, illness and accidents and now had to build temporary housing and forage, prepare and store food for the bitter cold months ahead. If all went well, they would reach their new home by late summer 1839.<br />This group of farmers, artisans, professional men, merchants, adventure seekers, and their women and children were led by skilled veteran mountainman Whip Holt, and his blood brother, Cherokee warrior Stalking Horse. They were joined in Independence, Missouri by Lieutenant Colonel Lee Blake, the US Army's leading counterintelligence expert. He had been sent by President Martin Van Buren to help protect the wagon train from the British and Russian saboteurs who were determined to destroy it. Both Russia and Great Britain were vying with the US for possession of the Oregon Territory and all its riches.<br />The group had long since accustomed itself to communal living and almost everyone worked easily together for the benefit of all. They had also been joined by La-Ena, a beautiful Indian woman, half-sister of Stalking Horse who Holt had spent several winters with before leading the wagon train. Dolores, a half Mexican, half Indian woman and seer joined them as did Ginny Dobbs, a woman who had been badly hurt by life. Their stories, mingled with those of characters from the earlier books, greatly enrich the novel. An epidemic of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever struck and many died from this dreaded disease, so some characters are lost also.<br />The author vividly brings history to life in &quot;Wyoming,&quot; as in the other books in the series. And the politics behind the settling of the West are fascinating. As one would expect, the novel is chock-full of adventure, hardship, courage, love, loss, tragedy and triumph.

In 1837 the United States was experiencing its first financial depression. Banks were failing, factories closing, and farms were being foreclosed. US citizens were increasingly hungry and dispossessed. Out of a population of 16 million, a quarter of a million were unemployed. People by the thousands were moving West to settle the wilderness and make a new start in life. Former US President Andrew Jackson, new President Martin Van Buren, and financier John Jacob Astor decided to assign mountainman and weathered veteran Sam Brentwood and his partner Michael &quot;Whip&quot; Holt to form the first wagon train of pioneers with the purpose of crossing the North American continent and settling the Oregon Territory. Imperial Russia and Great Britain were also determined to claim the Oregon Territory for themselves and planned to do everything in their countries' power to sabotage the United States' effort.<br /><br />The caravan now included 500 people and their horses, oxen and prairie schooners. Having reached the frontier town of Independence, Missouri, Sam Brentwood and his new wife leave the group to open a trading depot to supply future pioneers and wagon trains. Wagon scout Whip Holt now takes over as wagonmaster and the legendary group begins to move across the Great Plains to the Rockie Mountains on the second stage of their journey. They are set upon by hostile Indians, British and Russian spies, accidents and illness, and the petty bickering that comes from interacting with the same people day after day, along with the monotony of the trail. Relationships and rivalries are formed which prove to be every bit as exciting as the journey itself.<br />The characters are outstanding and extremely realistic.

United States' President Andrew Jackson, his Vice-president, Martin Van Buren, and financier and fur trader, John Jacob Astor, are in a race with the British and the Russians to settle and claim the Oregon Territory. Jackson calls upon his close friend, mountain man and rugged veteran Sam Brentwood, to put together a wagon train with the purpose of traveling overland to Oregon and settling the territory. The train of prairie schooners eventually includes over 500 people - folks who were willing to risk their lives to make the first overland trip across America in an entourage of this kind. They were motivated by the gift of 600 acres of free land to homestead in Oregon, and the opportunity to start new lives. The financial situation in the US was terrible during this period. Due to a major depression many of the potential Oregonians had lost their jobs, life savings and/or property.<br />Brentwood, the wagonmaster, and his assistant Whip Holt, begin the journey in Long Island along with a beautiful, feisty widow, her younger sister, and the sister's elderly husband. The small group pick up more people and covered wagons as they slowly move cross-country to Independence, Missouri. Missouri is the frontier town where Sam Brentwood will set-up a trading depot and leave the wagon train in charge of Whip Holt. Missouri will be the pioneers' last look at civilization until the Pacific Northwest is reached.<br />This is Book 1 of 24 in Dana Fuller Ross's fabulous &quot;Wagons West&quot; series. This fictional account of the first wagon train to cross the US is extraordinary. The characters are complex and very well developed. They obviously grow and change throughout the journey of almost three years. The author vividly brings history to life here. And the politics behind the settling of the West are fascinating, as are the descriptions of the land and the Native Americans the group encounters along the way.

Bonsai is the reproduction of natural tree forms in miniature which increase in beauty and value as they mature over the years. I am now thinking about purchasing another and want to learn as much as possible about the growth and proper care for these Japanese-style miniature plantings. I browsed through bookstores and also asked a friend, who has numerous healthy bonsais, for some book suggestions. I finally purchased &quot;Bonsai: Nature in Miniature.&quot; A few people recommended it as a bonsai book that is especially designed for beginners. It is also an excellent book to accompany a bonsai given as a present.<br />Kyuzo Murata and Isamu Murata have created a book filled with beautiful color photographs and drawings which provides specific, step-by-step instructions for: how to select a tree; what fertilizer to use; lighting; watering; trimming; wiring branches to form tree into desired shape, etc..

My husband and I, both Americans, worked there for an NGO, (Nongovernmental Agency), and were able to travel throughout the country. Our daughter was born there and when we left Iran, I left a piece of my heart behind. I recently came across Afshin Molavi's &quot;Persian Pilgrimages: Journeys Across Iran&quot; in a bookstore, and I couldn't resist buying it. After reading the book I must say that it truly brought back so many visual images, unique experiences and memories of Iranian friends, their extraordinary hospitality and culture, and the political turmoil that existed - even back then. I feel like the author has given me a greater understanding of the land I learned to love. He has also updated me on how the country and its people have changed over the years...and how they have remained the same.<br />Afshin Molavi, a young journalist and writer, was born in Iran and educated in the West. He returned to his homeland for a year, (1999-2000), to explore the many facets of Iranian society. Molavi states at the beginning of the book that his intent is to record the voices of Iranians, no matter what their politics may be. He traveled throughout the country, visiting many of the cities and towns that I knew, on a pilgrimage of sorts. Students of the right and left, bazaar merchants, Islamic clerics, pro-democracy journalists, taxi drivers, urban slum dwellers, village farmers, war veterans, partying teenagers, feminists, women who are pro and anti-veil (chador), political hard-liners and reformers all spoke openly and frankly to him and all have a voice in this wonderful journalistic-anthropological-travelogue.<br />Molavi weaves a story of nearly 3000 years of Persian/Iranian history and reflects on Iran's present problems in light of its past. He takes us to the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargad and to the exquisite rose gardens of the poet Hafez's shrine in Shiraz. We visit a shrine to Iran-Iraq War veterans and the Ayatollah Khomeini's mausoleum. A fascinating portrait of everyday life emerges from Iranians who sometimes hold diametrically opposing views. Molavi's Iranian heritage and knowledge have allowed him to penetrate the culture as no foreigner could. His Western background gives him the distance to report objectively.<br />This book is a gem. I found it to be extremely well written, more informative than most books of this kind, and deeply moving at times. Highly recommended!<br />JANAomeini's mausoleum.

Breuer gives a most unconventional look at World War II in this entertaining and informative book. He reveals little known schemes, ruses, masquerades, illusions and nuggets of espionage of military commanders and intelligence agencies through over eighty tales. Unlike the courageous battles, heroic fighting and exploits of conventional warfare, the secret missions disclosed here have been kept...well, secret - no matter how successful they were. And many of the successes were, in fact, brilliant.<br />Some of the accounts include: stealing Hitler's secret weapon; financing an FBI coup; \\"smuggling\\" ships to England; unmasking German spies; sending Nazis to tour the White House; Greta Garbo doing undercover work for the British; sending Little Wanda, a Polish Jew, to assassinate German officers; a German plot to kidnap Pope Pius XII; and many more exciting true-life tales.<br />Breuer collected these stories through personal interviews, official archives, declassified documents, books, articles, and magazines. This unusual book is absolutely fascinating, a must read for WWII buffs and anyone interested in the world of espionage during this period.<br />JANA	2004-06-20

I think this is partly so because Fainne, daughter of the renegade druid Ciaran and Niamh, the Sevenwaters daughter who was lost to the clan long ago, is the strongest of Marillier's heroines. This in no way diminishes the strength of Sorcha and Liadan, nor the roles these remarkable women played in the trilogy's first two books.<br />Fainne was brought up in almost total solitude after her mother's death. She and her father lived alone in the Honeycomb, a network of caves on the Kerry coast. It was, at best, an austere and lonely existence, especially for a child. Ciaran schooled her unceasingly in Druid craft and lore and Fainne didn't really want more out of life than to please her father - and pleasing him meant becoming proficient in all he taught. Ciaran, a great Druid priest, had little time for his daughter, other than to pass on his knowledge. He spent most of his life continuing to learn the ancient ways.<br />This story is set in a period when magic is fading and Christianity is fast becoming the dominant religion of Erin and Britain. The Old Ones are being driven to the Western Realms, beyond the reach of mankind. The ancient groves and forests are being destroyed and without them the true knowledge of the land will disappear. The prophecies say there is a way to prevent the total disappearance of this priceless lore...and that salvation lies within the Sevenwaters clan. It is to this end that Ciaran works to pass his knowledge to his daughter.<br />The wicked sorceress Oonagh is Fainne's grandmother. She emerged from the shadows in book one, &quot;Daughter of the Forest,&quot; to exert her evil ways and plan the destruction of all the Sevenwaters clan had worked for. Ciaran saw the necessity to leave his child for a time under Oonagh's tutelage. With her grandmother, Fainne would learn magic that she had never known or imagined before, and she would learn terrible fear as well.<br />Fainne is such a complex character. Her heritage is one of extreme darkness and of light - of both good and evil. The best of generations of the Sevenwaters clan runs in her blood, as does the evil of Oonagh. In order for the prophecy to succeed, Fainne must overcome her dual nature and prevail against her grandmother's power, while protecting those she loves.<br />Many characters from the previous books are present here: Conor the Druid, swan-winged Finbar, Liadan and her family, and vengeful Eamonn. So are the Fair Folk, (Tuatha de Danaan), and Old Ones. They await the Prophecy's end which will decide their own fate. All depends on Fainne's actions.<br />Ms. Marillier develops her cast of characters and gives them great depth. As with all fairy tales, there is magic at work here, just the right amount to awe but not to disturb reality too much or take away from the characters' independence and ability to choose.<br /><br />Although &quot;Child of the Prophecy&quot; can be read without reading the first two books, I strongly recommend reading them to best understand and enjoy this wonderful novel.<br />JANAc that she had never known or imagined before, and she would learn terrible fear as well.<br />Fainne is such a complex character.

A second generation of the Sevenwaters family is introduced here and many familiar folks from the first book have roles to play also. The characters are wonderful. They change and grow so much throughout the novels, that it is easy to care about and empathize with them. And the magic is...well, simply magical.<br />Sorcha, the &quot;Daughter of the Forest,&quot; married her beloved British husband Hugh of Harrowfield, who gave up his ancestral home to move to Erin and live with his wife at Sevenwaters. Together they became stewards of the enormous estate which, with its magical forest and strong ties to the old, druidic faith, prosper under their care. They have been blessed with three children: Niamh, who is as beautiful as she is willful; Sean, strong and capable like his father; and Sean's twin, Liadan, who, like her mother, is a gifted healer and seer.<br />Liadan's birth was not foreseen by the fairy folk, the Tuatha de Danaan, who so frequently intervene in the lives of this family. It is they who are determined to preserve the old ways through those of the Sevenwaters line. Neither Liadan's mother nor the magical beings who populate the age-old forests of Sevenwaters had counted on Sean, (whose birth was predicted as part of a prophecy), having a twin sister. This lack of foresight gave Liadan the power to change things previously ordained - to defy prophesy. But Liadan does not want power nor does she want a position of leadership in the clan. She is shy, and prefers the art and lore of healing to the more common pleasures of girls her age. Yet, it is Liadan who is finds herself thrust into the midst of the enemy, and taken away from the family that has loved and sheltered her. She is carried off to heal a dying outlaw, a mercenary in the band of the notorious and feared &quot;Painted Man.&quot;<br />This is a beautiful tale of familial devotion, self-sacrifice, steadfastness, adventure, travel - and above all, of love that must be strong enough to defy all odds - with a hero who is worthy of the exceptional young woman Liadan is. Although the plot and subplots are very strong this novel is definitely character driven. And, as noted before, Ms. Marillier develops her cast of characters and gives them great depth. As with all fairy tales, there is magic at work here, just the right amount to awe but not to disturb reality too much or take away from the characters' independence and ability to choose.<br />Although &quot;Son of the Shadows&quot; can be read and enjoyed without reading the first book, I strongly recommend reading &quot;Daughter Of The Forest&quot; before picking-up this terrific novel.

What if you could live most of your life over again? Would you change anything? Would you make the same mistakes? These are some of the questions facing Jeff Winston, who died of a heart attack in 1988 while on the telephone with his wife. Instead of resting in peace however, he revived. Jeff comes to in his old dorm room at Emory University in 1963. He has become a &quot;replayer.&quot;  And this is the beginning of a series of replays in which Jeff will have the opportunity to live his life over and over and over again. Is this a blessing or a curse?<br />I was quite taken with this literate novel's theme, the humanity of the characters and the choices they make. The main characters, Jeff and Pamela Phillips, a fellow &quot;replayer,&quot; are well developed personalities and their thoughts and actions drive the plot. Their dilemma is deeply felt. They are on a seemingly never-ending cycle which they cannot understand or make sense of except on the most elementary level. Their bewilderment and struggle to live better lives, and to reunite each time around makes for some emotional reading.<br />In &quot;Replay&quot; Ken Grimwood has touched on many of our fantasies regarding immortality, reincarnation, time travel, the acquisition of wealth and power, love, lust, creativity, hedonism and the meaning of life. Most important, he touches on how very precious life is and how we should all make the most of the time we have.<br />JANA	2004-06-15

He has a temporal-lobe tumor and the doctors give him 4-6 months to live. Richard has never been in love, and feels like he has not even begun to live his life, which is now doomed. He takes off, leaving his job and relatives behind, and decides to drive along the California coast, at whim, and write a book about the dying process. Collins stays at a turn-of-the-century resort in San Diego one night and there sees a portrait of a beautiful woman who lived and died almost 100 years before. He falls truly, deeply, madly in love with the woman in the painting and becomes obsessed with going back in time to find her.<br />Now, I am a huge fan of excellent romance fiction, and novels about time travel fascinate me. Jack Finney's &quot;Time After Time,&quot; and Diane Gabaldon's &quot;Outlander&quot; series are favorites of mine. &quot;Somewhere In Time,&quot; however, left me cold. Actually, I found the book annoying and it is only because I am an eternal optimist that I finished it.<br />The novel is written in a diary format. Richard Collins, the narrator, sounds appropriately desperate and depressed, given his situation. When he fixates on the woman in the portrait, actress Elise McKenna, he becomes obsessive. This obsession might also be appropriate. He is dying and he does have a brain tumor which could make him delusional. However, the reader must suffer along with him as he moans, (literally), for page after page, about how he loves Elise McKenna. Then we go along with him for yet another 50 pages while he repetitively attempts time travel. This is pure and simple narrative padding. Finally, on page 118, Collins arrives in 1896 and when the reader arrives there with him, exhaustion is felt by all. The meeting with Elise and their subsequent, very brief, relationship is simply not believable. And Collins is such a weak, almost hysterical figure, that if the story were easy to accept, one would wonder why a woman would fall for a man like him.<br />I really wanted to like this novel but in all honesty I cannot recommend it. There is some excellent time travel fiction on the market  - books which also include great love stories - this is not one of them.<br />JANAaccept, one would wonder why a woman would fall for a man like him.<br />I really wanted to like this novel but in all honesty I cannot recommend it.

From the moment I began this extraordinary novel until the last word of the last sentence I was caught-up, as usual, in the richness, the sheer luminosity, of Wallace Stegner's prose. I was also taken, from the first, by Joe Allston, the 64 year-old retired literary agent, main character and narrator of &quot;All The Little Live Things.&quot; Allston is one of the most complex characters I have met in literature and for some reason he crept into my heart.<br />Outwardly a curmudgeon of the first order, he is introspective and ruthlessly honest with himself...and with everyone else. Stegner once said about his writing, &quot;In fiction I think we should have no agenda but to tell the truth.&quot; Joe Allston personifies this maxim. He seeks his own truth - the reality behind his feelings and actions. He is aware of his flaws, his resistance to change, his near obsession with the Protestant work ethic and resentment towards those seeking to escape it through alternative lifestyles. He also agonizes over the death of his son and their terribly flawed relationship.<br />This is a story of relationships, of love, alienation, anger and death and their role in Allston's life and in the human condition. Set in the late 1960s, a time of political unrest, general dissent and back to nature &quot;hippie lifestyles,&quot; Joe is bewildered and angered by society's changing mores. He and his wife Ruth have a ranch in the California hills. When a manipulative young man on a motorcycle asks to camp on his land, Joe begrudgingly gives his consent. Another newcomer to Allston's life is the lovely young mother, Marion Catlin, who moves to a nearby house with her husband and child. A hauntingly poignant love story lies at the heart of this novel - the relationship between Joe and this young, pregnant mother. Marion is the daughter he always longed for and fills a void in him that no one has before. Allston describes Marion: &quot;She looks as if she had bloomed into this spring day, she had a tremble on her like young poplar leaves.&quot; &quot;She is one of Willie Yeats's glimmering girls, with apples blossoms in her hair, and I admit to a pang. God knows what it is - maybe envy that someone is lucky to have such a daughter.&quot; Gorgeous!<br />The story and characters are so real, so totally believable! And this is no accident - it is due to the author's careful crafting.  Every time I read a novel by Wallace Stegner I wind up proclaiming it to be my favorite. &quot;All The Little Live Things&quot; is certainly a favorite and an absolutely glorious work of fiction.<br />JANAshe had a tremble on her like young poplar leaves.&quot; &quot;She is one of Willie Yeats's glimmering girls, with apples blossoms in her hair, and I admit to a pang.

However, it remains a pertinent work of historical fiction in its description of the people and their divergent cultures, the nature of the wild, majestic land, and insight into the political, economic and social dilemmas of post WWII Afghanistan.<br />A young American diplomat, Mark Miller, stationed in Kabul in 1946 is given an unusual assignment. He is directed to find a young American woman who had disappeared in Afghanistan. Ellen Jasper, formerly of Philadelphia high society, had married a westernized Afghani engineer, a graduate of the Wharton School, against her parents wishes. The couple returned to the groom's home in Kabul and, after a thirteen month period without correspondence from their daughter, the Jaspers were frantic with worry.<br />Miller's extraordinary journey across the forbidding, awe inspiring terrain of Afghanistan in search of the lost debutante makes for a riveting read. There are plot twists and surprises throughout and nothing is quite as it appears to be. I prefer Michner's early work and this is one his best books - especially in lieu of current events.<br />JANA	2004-06-01

Wallace Stegner's luminous prose and subtle, nuanced story of relationships make \\"Crossing To Safety\\" one of my favorite books and, I believe, Stegner's best work. If you love a beautifully crafted novel and find joy in the written word, this masterpiece is a must read.<br /><br />The plot is a simple one. The author writes of the forty-year friendship between two couples, the Langs and the Morgans. They meet during the Depression at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where both men have teaching jobs in the English Department. Their young wives are both pregnant. From the very first the four find they have worlds in common, in spite of their very different backgrounds. The bond between them becomes so strong, so quickly, that when the Morgan's daughter is born, she is named Lang. Larry Morgan, a successful novelist, narrates. He looks back at the lifelong friendship, the intertwined lives of the four, the shared coming of age experience, the complexities and dependencies of marriage, and muses on loyalty, vulnerability, conflict, kindness and love. Although the story spans decades, there are few sensational or dramatic incidents. This may disappoint some. However, Stegner makes his point by this very lack of action and/or heroism. Morgan, the writer, at one point thinks: \\"How do you make a book that anyone will read out of lives as quiet as these? Where is the high life, the conspicuous waste, the violence, the kinky sex, the death wish? Where are speed, noise, ugliness...everything that makes us recognize ourselves in fiction?\\" At another point, Charity Lang asks Morgan: \\"Why don't you just ignore all that stuff so many modern writers concentrate on, and write something about a really decent, kind, good human being living a normal life in a normal community...?\\"<br /><br />From these four lives the author paints a vivid portrait of a friendship and illustrates that even ordinary lives carry the possibility of great drama. This is truly a magnificent and moving novel.<br />JANAel.<BR>JANA	2004-06-01

In a hurry, I picked up &quot;Carnal Innocence&quot; for a light read on a long train trip. Not expecting much, (maybe it was the title?), I was surprised to find this Nora Roberts' novel very entertaining.<br />Carolyn Waverly, a world-class concert violinist takes a much needed break from her high pressured tours and a romance gone sour. She visits her deceased grandparents' home in Innocence, Mississippi, hoping to find the tranquillity she experienced there as a child. As she begins to settle-in and get to know the friendly locals, a murder victim is found on her property - the third victim in a series of serial killings. Apparently the town's most attractive women are being targeted for death. The sheriff and FBI do not know if the murderer is a stranger lurking in the bayou or a lifelong inhabitant of Innocence. To complicate matters for the lovely Caroline, her new beau, (he works fast!), the irresistibly charming, handsome, Tucker Longstreet, is a suspect.<br />There are a few surprises in the plot and Ms. Roberts' characters are wonderful. Caroline Waverly, who has lead a lonely life on the road, with constant concert tours, is immediately taken into the bosom of the townsfolk. Many remember her as a child and begin to treat her like extended family. The southern warmth and hospitality, along with some local history and characters' foibles, liven up the novel as much as the mystery and romance. A fun, light read - perfect for long train or plane trips!<br />JANA	2004-06-01

Kaye, the author of two of my favorite historical novels, &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Moon,&quot; does not disappoint with &quot;Trade Wind.&quot; Unlike her other books, which are set in India, this tale is told against the languid, sensuous, often savage beauty of 19th century Zanzibar - a lawless island paradise off the coast of East Africa.<br />Hero Athena Hollis, a lovely Boston bluestocking with a long list of good intentions and a self-appointed mission to abolish slavery, visits her diplomat uncle and his family who are stationed in Zanzibar. In transit, there is a violent storm at sea and the unfortunate Hero is swept overboard only to be rescued by Captain Rory Frost, disreputable scoundrel, privateer, slave trader, etc.. She is eventually returned to the bosom of her family, unscathed, but with a tremendous dislike of the Captain and his chosen profession.<br />This epic romance is chock-full of adventure and excitement - international politics, the slave trade, Arabian sultans and princesses, revolution, pirates, natural disasters, espionage and intrigue. Ms. Kaye's research, as always, is impeccable. Her characters are subtly developed, three dimensional and very believable. The love story is quite unique - outwardly the couple does not seem to be a &quot;match made in heaven.&quot; However, the chemistry does work and the romance provides some unusual twists to the plot. There is a rape scene, as some reviewers have mentioned, but I don't think rape has been romanticized here. There is violence in the novel, as this is a historically accurate piece, about a place that has a violent history. The rape is not gratuitous nor is it graphic. The episode adds rather than detracts from the plot.<br />I was captivated by &quot;Trade Wind&quot; and apart from the spellbinding saga, I learned much about the history of the strange, lovely island called Zanzibar.

I have nothing against dark or gothic, but there is a lack of originality in this predictable plot and the characters lack the usual &quot;Heyer spark.&quot; I believe that the author wrote this novel while she was ill. This is apparent as her delightful verve is very much missing here.<br />Kate Malvern, 24, orphaned and penniless, has been fired from her job as a governess through no fault of her own. She is surprised by an invitation to stay with her father's half sister, (whom she has never met), at the sumptuous estate Staplewood. There she meets the elderly lord of the manor, her aunt's husband Sir Timothy, their strange and ailing son, Torquil, and a cast of characters right out of the Addam's Family scrapbook. Why has this distant relation made Kate an honored guest and gifted her with beautiful clothing, jewelry and almost cloying kindness? Kate thinks she has the answers....but...?<br />I would say that to discover the secrets behind this strange tale you will have to read the book. However, as a major Georgette Heyer fan, I don't mind reading her most mediocre novels...and there aren't many. You, on the other hand, may want to save yourself the time. There isn't very much to surprise, enlighten or horrify here. This one is not a keeper.<br />JANA	2004-05-29

Claude Monet's fascination with the Mediterranean began in December 1883, when Pierre-Auguste Renoir invited him on a trip to the Riviera. En route to the sea they visited Paul C&eacute;zanne in L'Estaque. By the time they reached Monaco, their first Mediterranean stop, Monet was completely enchanted by the warm southern climate, its lush, exotic vegetation, and the extraordinary quality of light. He was to return again and again to the southern coasts of France and Italy to paint some of his most superb work.<br />&quot;Monet And The Mediterranean&quot; unites over 100 paintings created during the course of three major trips Monet made to the Mediterranean from 1883 to 1908. The sheer beauty of the nature these works depict is breathtaking, as are the luminescent colors of his palette and dazzling light effects. The artist's use of light is frequently dramatic, as he often painted scenes at sunrise, midday and sunset.<br />Joachim Pisarro has brilliantly communicated, through this text, his deep love for painting and art history. He has combined and provided here a biography, history, and critical interpretation that allowed me to view some of my favorite paintings as if for the first time. This volume features over 100 color plates, with introductory commentaries for each series or group of paintings. The artist's love of the region and its light is evident in his work - from olive and citrus trees in the Italian fishing village of Bordighera to the vast seas and skies of Cap Martin and Cap d'Antibes to the shadowy canals and golden Ducal Palace of Venice. The Mediterranean was, perhaps, Monet's greatest muse, providing him with a climate, light and color that possessed him with what curator Joachim Pissarro calls an &quot;ineluctable need to paint.&quot;<br />A real treasure of a book!

A central figure in Warsaw's Yiddish literary scene and cultural world, Kacyzne began a ten-year journey in 1921 that was to prove much more important than anyone could have conceived.

(Although there are still some loopholes left - tiny ones, but just enough room for another book to slip through. Always hoping)!<br />Ten years have past since we last saw our lash-loving lady, the true &quot;anguisette,&quot; Phedre no Delauney, Comtesse de Montreve, peer of Terre d'Ange. She and her beloved companion, the Cassiline apostate, Joscelin Verreuil have been residing on their estates and maturing with grace and beauty. But neither is able to forget the fate of Phedre's childhood friend Hyacinthe and the terrible sacrifice he made in order that a queen be crowned and peace reign. Nothing less than discovering the most secret and holy name of the &quot;One God&quot; will do to free him - an almost impossible task to accomplish which will involve traveling over continents and seas, in what I believe is the most awesome adventure of them all! Then Melisande Shahrizai, Phedre's nemesis and patron of old, surfaces and begs a boon - I won't even go there. You'll have to read the book.<br />The adventures of Phedre and friends are every bit as breathtaking, if not more so, than those in preceding books. Ms. Carey has explored various religions and forms of spirituality in her other novels - religions resembling Christianity and Judaism, and others where gods and demigods are worshipped, similar to those of ancient Greece and Rome. In this, the last part of the trilogy, the author pulls all her characters and their adventures together to show a bigger pattern and spiritual purpose. In other words, there is an author's message. These folks are not just hanging out to have fun while risking life and limb...and lash! Phedre discovers that her service to Kushiel has served a much higher cause than she ever thought possible, and has been integrated into the service of all whom she has served.

Richard A. Clarke's &quot;Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror,&quot; stands out amongst them all as an absolutely riveting, intelligently written discussion of the most harrowing issue of the new century - terrorism.<br />Clarke, the former counterterrorism czar for both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush is an authority on the subject. He began his federal service in 1973, in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, served under seven presidents and has been involved with national security until he resigned his position in 2003. After devoting two decades of his professional life to fighting terrorism, Mr. Clarke probably knows more about al Qaeda, Osama bin Ladin and why our government failed to prevent September 11 than anyone else in this country.<br />Clarke's account of the action in the White House on 9/11, as Crisis Manager in the Situation Room, reads like a novel. I have read many firsthand accounts of that day - as a Manhattanite I was deeply and personally affected - but this insider's description of how government leaders operate in crisis mode is the most fascinating.<br />There is much that is disturbing in this book about the presidencies of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and their administrations' approach to terrorism: misplaced priorities; credible warnings ignored; a lack of vertical communication; lack of intelligence and analysis; little cooperation and information sharing between the CIA and FBI; a Cold War mindset; inability to see the &quot;big picture;&quot; and an obsessive focus on Iraq when there was no proof of a connection between Saddam Hussein and September 11. There is more than enough blame to go around. I don't think this is a book about blame, however.  Whatever your politics, no one wants the United States, or any country in the world, to be vulnerable to terrorist acts. I believe that Clarke treats both Bush administrations and the Clinton presidency fairly. This political memoir also chronicles the rise of al Queada.<br />Clarke's writing style is crystal clear and concise. His knowledgeable account of the goings-on in the Beltway's  corridors of power is compelling and highly readable. This is an extraordinary history of The War on Terror that began two decades ago.

This lash-loving lady has come a long way from the little girl who was sold by her parents, years before, into the service of Naamah, the honored profession of the courtesan. Phedre was kissed by the god Kushiel. There is a tiny crimson mote in the white of her left eye, (Kushiel's Dart), marking her as an &quot;anguisette,&quot; one of Kushiel's Chosen. A true &quot;anguisette&quot; is extremely rare. They are born to find pleasure in pain.<br />Phedre played a major part in ending the violent war that threatened to destroy her country. The new Queen of Terre D'Ange, who Phedre pledged to serve and protect, has been crowned. However, those who would wrest the throne for themselves continue to plot treachery and renewed violence. Chief among the traitors is Melisande Shahrizai, Phedre's nemesis and patron of old. Melisande announces her continued presence in the world of intrigue by beginning a game of cat and mouse with Phedre, who comes out of retirement to thwart plans to harm the Queen. Her return to Court, the City of Elua, and her profession as a spy, threaten her star-crossed relationship with her beloved companion and bodyguard, the Cassiline apostate, Joscelin Verreuil.<br />The plot and subplots are unique and stunning. The excitement just doesn't stop. Ms. Carey combines eroticism with swashbuckling adventure, romance and world building. Her imaginative use of historic detail, diverse cultures, the creation of many varied characters and their development, make this series so special. A riveting novel - I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended!<br />JANA	2004-05-19

Author Jacqueline Carey weaves an intricate tale, a tapestry of adventure, political intrigue, love, friendship, trust and betrayal. She creates an enormous and varied cast of characters, as well as a variety of religions which motivate them - one resembling Christianity, another, a form of Judaism, and others where gods and demigods are worshipped, similar to those of ancient Greece and Rome. A most unique and unusual young women, who helps make history, narrates this story of a world in upheaval.<br /><br />The main setting, Terre D'Ange, is a land of extraordinary beauty and grace, where it is said that the inhabitants, Angelines, are part angel and part mortal. Phedre no Delauney was sold into the service of Naamah, the honored profession of the courtesan, as a young child. She was a beautiful girl who will grow to be a magnificent woman - not unusual amongst those who are part angel. However, she was kissed by the god. There is a tiny crimson mote in the white of her left eye, (Kushiel's Dart), marking her as an &quot;anguisette,&quot; one of Kushiel's Chosen. A true &quot;anguisette&quot; is extremely rare. Perhaps one is born every 4 or 5 generations. Anguisettes find pleasure in pain. She says of her fate, &quot;When Love cast me out, it was Cruelty who took pity on me.&quot;<br /><br />Phedre was bought by a wealthy peer of the realm, Anafiel Delauney, master spy and beloved of a King. When she was ten years-old he began to train her. She was to become the most famous courtesan in the realm. Prostitution is legal in Terre D'Ange and there is much cachet in belonging to an excellent house and/or in receiving exceptional schooling in the arts of love, letters and conversation. Delauney took her schooling one step further and taught her to gather and interpret intelligence.<br /><br />A young queen is about to be crowned but there are others who vie for the throne. Delauney is sworn to protect the young princess and insure her reign. Thus Phedre is pledged to do the same. As she entertains and serves her patrons, Phedre learns dangerous information - secrets and lies - that set the wheels of adventure rolling. Her world is turned upside down, as friends turn foe and masters becomes pawns. All are somehow involved in plots and subplots, pieces of a large puzzle which she must solve to save her future queen.<br /><br />I really enjoyed &quot;Kushiel's Dart,&quot; the first book in Jacqueline Carey's trilogy. This is probably the only one of the three novels that can stand alone. The ending is a satisfying one, although it leaves more than enough loopholes to make one want to read more.  There are some major flaws here also. The novel is much too long. There is a huge cast of characters and I had difficulties remembering many of them, although there is a key which is helpful. The dialogue is too flowery at times. But the principal characters are fabulous. They are very well developed, exciting, diverse - just plain fascinating. And their adventures, intrigues and battles are breathtaking. This epic adventure, part erotic odyssey, part chronicle of a land and its people will Wow you!

Since my childhood, I have always loved a good fairy tale and this Celtic-themed fantasy is a real winner - for both teens and adults alike. Juliet Marillier's &quot;Daughter of the Forest&quot; is loosely based on versions of Hans Christian Andersen's, (and the Brothers' Grimm), tale of six brothers who are placed under an evil spell and transformed into wild birds, and their sister who, under great hardship, must save them.<br /><br />Lovely Sorcha should have been born the seventh son of a seventh son. But she was born a daughter, with six older brothers. Sorcha's mother died at her birth, leaving behind words of love for all her children. Lord Colum of Sevenwaters, the children's father, lost much of his joyous spirit with his wife's death and changed drastically in the ensuing years. He focused his energies on war rather than family and kept his emotions in tight rein. Colum spent much of his time patrolling his extensive landholdings to protect his forest properties and Ireland's borders from outsiders - the Britons, Picts and Vikings. He also spent time planning for war against the British, his primary enemy. The British had stolen three sacred Isles, holy to the Old Religion and central to its practice. At any and all cost, the islands must be won back. Colum's oldest sons, Liam, Diarmid, Cormack and Padriac were trained in arms and fighting and accompanied their father on his missions and strategy sessions. Conor, Cormack's twin was plainly not destined to be a warrior. He was a scholar, interested in Druid teachings, and took on the duties of the house steward. Finbar, to his father's despair, was not a fighter either - he was a man of peace. And young Sorcha, who her sire paid little attention to, was allowed to run wild, but was tutored in reading, writing, Gaelic and the British language by a Catholic priest, Father Brian, who lived nearby. Like her mother before her, Sorcha had The Sight and was an excellent healer. The good father furthered her education in the healing arts also.<br /><br />Into this relatively peaceful setting came two strangers who were to significantly alter everyone's lives. Simon of Harrowfield, a young Briton of a noble house, was captured on Colum's land. He was called a spy and brutally tortured. In the dead of night Sorcha and Finbar took him to Father Brian's in hopes of healing him and getting him back to his own people. Connor gave them his blessing. All three youths risked their father's wrath and perhaps, even death, if they would be discovered. Then Colum returned from a trip with Lady Oonagh, his new bride-to-be - the second stranger. All the children sensed something terribly evil in her, especially Conor, Finbar and Sorcha. In order to gain total power over Colum and reduce his children's power, she seduced one son and began to make trouble for the others. Her vicious acts came to a head one day when she found the seven siblings all together and bewitched the boys. She turned them into wild swans, who would be able to return to their human forms only twice a year for a twenty-four hour period. Sorcha was left alone and bereft. The ancient Lady of the Forest came to her and explained how she could break the spell which bound her brothers. She told how difficult the task would be and how much strength she would need in order to complete her work. Sorcha eagerly accepted the job and left home, where she remained in danger from her stepmother, to begin her work and unravel the terrible spell.<br /><br />This is a beautiful tale of familial devotion, self-sacrifice, steadfastness, adventure, travel - and yes, of love and romance - with a hero who is worthy of the exceptional young woman Sorcha is. Although the plot and subplots are very strong this novel is definitely character driven. And Ms. Marillier develops her cast of characters and gives them great depth. Much of what happens to Sorcha and her brothers is beyond their control but they recognize the root of their problems andwisely set about doing what they can to resolve them. The intelligent choices they make shape the narrative. As with all fairy tales, there is magic at work here, just the right amount to awe but not to disturb reality too much or take away from the characters' independence and ability to choose.<br /><br />&quot;Daughter of the Forest&quot; is the first part of a trilogy but stands very well on its own and is an excellent novel and a delightful read.

This novel had the potential to be excellent literary fiction. At times Carlos Ruiz Zafon's writing reminded me of both Gabriel Garcia Marquez's and Jorge Luis Borges' work. My expectations rose dramatically as I began to hope for more than a good read. Instead of great literature, however, the novel became an overlong and predictable bestseller, with a most original premise, some brilliant passages and many flaws.<br /><br />Sr. Ruiz Zafon's extraordinary idea of creating a Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a labyrinthian library where each book awaits someone to choose it and give it another chance to live by making it part of the new owner's life, gave me chills. There existed a possibility, as I read the first chapters, that I might be able to list this as one of my favorite works of fiction. Unfortunately, my disappointment when reaching the novel's conclusion overshadowed the book's many positive elements.<br /><br />Daniel Sempere is a young boy who fears he has forgotten the image of his dead mother's face. His compassionate father, an antiquarian book dealer, introduces him to the book cemetery. Daniel and Sr. Sempere are both memorable and unusual characters, as are many of Ruiz Zafon's other figures. Fermin, a former Republican agent who becomes a second father to Daniel, and Julian Carax, the author of the book Daniel selects, are both extraordinary men. Daniel's choice of books ultimately determines the course of his life, as he tries to discover if the author is still alive and solve the multitude of mysteries surrounding him. The setting, post-WWII Barcelona, is fascinating and Zafon depicts a brooding city in mourning as a result of the atrocities of both civil and world wars. The rich plot and various subplots, filled with passion, obsession and revenge, have such potential but become terribly convoluted and lose coherence at times. There is much too much information given about some of the characters, their rationales, and oddly enough, about an ancient, haunted house. Much of the mysterious ambiance is lost as a result of all the unwieldy description. Here, the concept \\"less is more\\" would have strongly improved the narrative. The entire novel could have been cut by a third, perhaps, and made a better, tighter book without losing any of the story or character development. I am a big fan of long, juicy novels, but the length should have a purpose and enhance the tale. The author has focused more on the melodramatic rather than the literary elements. Some may not care, as this is an excellent read. I did care though, as I see so much more potential here and hope the author lives up to it next time.<br /><br />I do recommend \\"The Shadow Of The Wind.\\" Most will find it highly enjoyable, as did I.

She certainly does not disappoint her fans with &quot;The Snow Fox,&quot; an elegantly written, multidimensional saga of 12th century Japan. Her characters, as always, are rich, compelling and three-dimensional. However, their various tales of love, both lasting and ephemeral, brutal civil war, loyalty to the ancient samurai code and to their warlord, Machiavellian politics, plague and illness, the camaraderie of noble soldiers and bandits alike, and the jealousies of beautiful court ladies, prove true the old adage that, &quot;The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.&quot; The author weaves here an intricate and complete tapestry - a portrait of three particular characters, set against the backdrop of a beautiful country during the most turbulent of times.<br />One thousand years ago, while art and culture still flourished in Japan, warlords and their samurais vied for power, turning their land into a bloody battlefield where chaos and anarchy reigned supreme. Lord Norimasa, one of the most powerful of the Japanese lords, was ruthless in his ambition to reunite and stabilize the kingdom. Poetry, art and beauty were held in the highest esteem by Norimasa's opulent court. Lady Utsu, renowned for her extraordinary physical beauty, was a remarkably gifted poet. Lord Norimasa had brought her to court when she was just a child, ostensibly to teach Chinese to Lady Tsukie, Norimasa's wife. The little girl had learned the language from a man in her native village. The royal couple treated the girl as one of their own, until Norimasa took her as a lover when she reached her teens. This entanglement caused never-ending problems between Lady Tsukie and the young woman, who had little say in the romantic attachment her mentor formed for her. As she matured, Lady Utsu also become renowned for her cruelty to men. A later lover of Utsu's, once told her wisely that, &quot;Pain that cannot be endured turns to cruelty. In your life, it has.&quot; This man was the samurai, Matsuhito, who was destined to love Utsu deeply all his life. He too was brought to court as a youth by Lord Norimasa. There he trained to be a great warrior and followed his lord until Norimasa's death, many years later, released him from his vows of loyalty and further participation in the ongoing war. These three characters are inextricably bound together throughout the novel and all bear love for the other, in different ways, to different degrees.<br />The most enduring love and relationship, however, is Matsuhito's and Utsu's. They meet and feel the intense emotions of lovers in the prime of youth, but never reveal the extent of their feelings to each other. War and hardship separate them, seemingly forever. The two do reunite, as is their destiny. They meet in middle-age, so transformed by time that they do not recognize each other physically. However, the spiritual bond and attraction that first brought them together still binds them. There is an additional mystical bond between the two, formed through their pet Snow Foxes - their sole companions in the years of lonely wanderings in the cold northern Snow Country.<br />The intensity, honesty and extraordinary closeness of the relationship between this middle-aged couple far surpasses the experience and passion of their fleeting time together years before. I think one of the author's primary themes is the transitory nature of all things and experiences. Though some may think the book ends tragically, I do not agree. I rather believe what Matsuhito found to be true as he thinks to himself, &quot;How strange Utsu and Matsuhito both were, each in love with the other, each unaware of how deep their feelings went. Yet in the end, they found each other again. Few people are given such a chance.&quot;<br />The author's prose is as lyrical and poignant as haiku poetry. And indeed, the actual poetry in the book is wonderful. She paints exquisite landscapes with words that evoke images of Sesshu, using a delicate, muted palette and changing to rich, brilliant colors to describe the gorgeous multilayered kimonos and costumes used during the period. Ms. Schaeffer is at her best when developing character and describing emotion in the most subtle of ways, which leave the reader with a sense of loss once the novel is completed. Kudos to SFS on completing another wonderful novel!<br />JANAed, the actual poetry in the book is wonderful.

Patrick O'Malley named his daughter Gracelin for the famed Pirate Queen, Granuaile, daughter of the great Irish Chieftain Owen - a woman feared by the English and revered by her people. He named her thus, he said, &quot;because at the moment of her birth it was clear that the light of the sea shone in her eyes.&quot; And young Grace became the light and strength of her family, especially after her mother died in a terrible accident which also left her younger brother, Sean, lame and her father bereft. The family's fortune continued to decline and when Gracelin was fifteen, in 1844, her dad arranged a marriage for her with the local English landlord, Squire Bram Donnelly, to save the family from financial ruin. Her husband-to-be was twice her age, twice married and twice a widower, with a reputation for violence. Although Grace O'Malley Donnelly began her marriage with hope, her husband's reputation was well deserved and as the Irish &quot;troubles&quot; worsened, so did the Donnelly marriage.<br />The Great Irish famine of the 1840's is looked upon as the single greatest social disaster of 19th century Europe. Between 1845 and 1850, when blight devastated the potato crop in Ireland, over two million people - almost one-quarter of the entire population - either died or emigrated.  Along with the famine, death, and disease, came tremendous political unrest. Gracelin repeatedly defied her husband by trying to feed her starving neighbors and by harboring rebels, her revolutionary brother and a beloved childhood friend among them. Grace's spirit was indomitable, like that of the legendary pirate queen for whom she was named. And like the pirate queen, she was terrible and ruthless when it came to protecting her own.<br />Anne Moore's accurate historical account of the horrors of life in nineteenth century Ireland and the brutality and greed of the English landlords really elevate this novel above most historical romances. Ms. Moore read history books and personal journals from this period and studied the dramatic and complex elements that made the Irish famine such a profound tragedy. She states in an interview in the Conversation Guide, published at the novel's conclusion, how  struck she was &quot;by the continued optimism of the Irish in the face of extreme poverty, their spirit and simple joy in living each day, their love for their children and pride in their heritage.&quot; She has captured here the lilt and laughter of the Gaelic, as well as the sorrow of a people. Her characters are  three-diminsional and unforgettable, especially Gracelin, whose beauty and courage remained a beacon of hope to all who knew her.

Due to an unfortunate fall and multiple injuries he is bed ridden in the hospital and the long healing process and subsequent inaction are driving him crazy. A friend, knowing of the Inspector's passion for faces, brings him a portfolio of historical portraits thinking to distract him. She hopes he will involve himself in solving a &quot;classic&quot; historical mystery, since he seems to know all the facts of the Scotland Yard cases by heart. Grant homes in on the portrait of King Richard III, the supposedly wicked uncle who murdered his nephews, the boy princes, in the London's Tower. He remembers how Richard was portrayed in elementary school history and certainly recalls Shakespeare's vivid portrait of the evil hunchbacked king. However, try as he may, Grant cannot reconcile the face in the painting with that of a tyrannical childrens' murderer and usurper of England's throne. He sees conscience and integrity in the face of the painting's subject. And his curiousity is aroused for the first time since his accident.<br />Grant asks for historical books and reads everything he can get his hands on. He finally comes into contact with a young research student from America who also becomes caught-up in the hypothesis that Richard III was framed. Author Josephine Tey, with the skill of the best in Scotland Yard, conducts an objective investigation of a centuries-old crime. She evenly portrays both side of the story, Richard III's and King Henry VII's (the other suspect), with all its twists and turns, reveals compelling evidence and comes to an amazing conclusion.<br />The reader is literally taken back in time to examine the accusations, testimonies and material relating to the death of Richard's brother, King Edward IV in 1483, the known history of his sons, Princes Edward and Richard after their father's death and their mysterious disappearance, the behavior of Edward's widow and children, including his eldest daughter Elizabeth, who becomes Henry's bride, Queen and mother to Henry VIII. Tey provides an extraordinarily well researched profile of Richard III, pieced together directly from historical documents, and another profile of Henry Tudor. The author also examines the 1934 exhumation of the two children who were first dug up in 1674. Motives are examined and finally, conclusions are drawn, proving, once again, that history is written by winners.<br />This is a riveting piece of detective history. Usually historians are detectives. In this case we are introduced to a detective who becomes a historian. Step-by-step, Grant plays out his theories according to evidence and comes up with logical deductions. One may already know what the conclusions are, but that is not the point of this mystery novel. The book provides the opportunity to go back in history and view a more three-dimensional side to well known characters, examine documents, and understand the rationale of those who lied or who closed their eyes to the truth. In this case, a mistrust of the official version of &quot;the truth&quot; brings the truth to light.<br />Alan Grant and the supporting cast of characters are wonderful, as is the witty dialogue.

Marion Zimmer Bradley's &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; is one of my favorite versions of the Arthurian legend. I first read the novel in the early 1990s, right after its publication. I reread it recently and was surprised at how much I enjoyed this extraordinary novel the second time around. I turned the pages more slowly and took more time to savor Ms. Bradley's excellent narrative and fresh version of the legendary saga of the rise and fall of Camelot. Her take on the classic characters gives them new depth and dimension. She tells her tale from a feminine perspective, and while the King and knights of Camelot dwell on war, battles and keeping their golden city and realm safe, along with focusing on chivalric honor, the women have different priorities and concerns.<br /><br />The tale is told from the points of view of the much maligned Morgaine, (Morgana Le Fey), Priestess of Avalon and Gwenhwyfar, (Gwynivere), Christian princess and future queen of Camelot. Although most of the events of the traditional Arthurian legend are presented here, it is extremely interesting how the tale, told by men, changes when viewed through the eyes and experiences of a woman. This is also the important story of the political and religious conflict between the new Christianity and the &quot;old ways&quot; of goddess worship. Believers of each religion seek to control the throne, but ultimately Christianity ascends to be the organized religion of the land. Since Morgaine is a Druid High Priestess, it would explain why she received such a bad rap in Christian civilization. The reader also views other famous female characters from a different vantage point, including Igraine, Morgaine's and Arthur's mother,<br />Ms. Bradley follows Morgaine from childhood to Priestess in her home on the Isle of Avalon, the center of Druidism and goddess worship since the Roman occupation forced the religion underground, where it remained long after the Roman departure. Mists surround this mystical isle, protecting it and its inhabitants from all who do not have the psychic powers to penetrate the barrier. Morgaine has dedicated her life to preserving her ancient religion and tries to defend it against the growing numbers of her countrymen and the Camelot royalty who exchange the old ways for Christianity. She is also a very powerful person and struggles against the stereotypes which expect her to adhere to more traditional &quot;feminine,&quot; (dependent), behavior and roles.<br />Bradley also follows the lovely Gwenhwyfar from the innocence of her girlhood to her rise as King Arthur's Christian Queen. She deeply fears Druid magic and her terror causes her to miscarry a long awaited baby. King Arthur's acquiescence to his wife's pleas to turn his back on the old ways and adopt Christianity is the beginning of the cataclysmic fall of his reign.<br />This is a most unique novel and Ms. Bradley's innovative fantasy version of Camelot, Britain during the Dark Ages, and the profound changes which took place in the land and among the people during this period had me riveted until I completed the last page. If you are open to a different take on a classic tale, then I highly recommend this wonderful novel.<br />JANA, protecting it and its inhabitants from all who do not have the psychic powers to penetrate the barrier.

If you are open to a different take on a classic tale, then I highly recommend this wonderful novel.<BR>JANA	2004-04-23

Ms. Bradley writes of the Roman conquest of Celtic Britain and the political and religious implications of the occupation. Roman rule also impacted the role of women in Britain. Goddess worship, women's freedom and power waned under the Romans. This novel gives the author's historical version of Avalon and the Lady of the Lake.<br />Eilan, the daughter of a Druidic warrior and granddaughter of Ardanos, Arch-Druid of Britannia, is gifted with the &quot;sight&quot; and has longed to serve the Goddess as a healer-priestess in the Forest House. She meets and falls in love with Gauis, a half Roman-half British youth, and son of the Roman Prefect Macellius Severus, second-in-command in Britainnia. They want to marry but are forbidden. Heartbroken, Eilan fulfills her original wish and dedicates herself to the Lady. Ms. Bradley blends a fascinating story with accurate research to give the reader a good picture of early Britain and the various political, cultural and religious factions, both local and Roman, which vied for power there.<br />Bradley's narrative is clear and her plot is believable, as are her characters. I prefer &quot;The Mists of Avalon,&quot; not just because of the subject matter, but because the plot and characters are more complex. However, this is a solid novel with a sound plot and worth the read.<br />JANA	2004-04-22

Anne Bishop's extraordinary \\"Black Jewels Trilogy\\" is one of the most original, truly spectacular reads I have had in a long time. I am not a big fan of science fiction or fantasy novels, but I became totally absorbed at the beginning of the first novel, \\"Daughter of the Blood,\\" and remained riveted by Ms. Bishop's narrative until the last page of the thrilling conclusion in \\"Queen of the Darkness.\\"<br />Ms. Bishop has created a unique world and populated it with some of the most unusual characters I have met in literature. This is a world where Darkness reigns and power is determined by the color of one's Jewels. In the hierarchy of the three Realms, Women of the Blood who wear Jewels are naturally dominant because of their innate magical powers. Blood Males who wear Jewels can also be extremely powerful, but they are born to serve their Queens. And magical strength is measured by a person's Jewels - the darker the Jewel's color, the more powerful the possessor.<br />Bishop paints a vivid portrait of two women in a terrible and vicious power struggle. Dorothea, the High Priestess of Hayll, and Hekatah, the self-proclaimed Dark Priestess of Hell, were created to be noble caretakers of the Realms. They have each perverted their Craft and their purpose, infected those who serve them, and threaten to destroy the Realms to fulfill their insatiable greed for power.<br />The plot revolves around a young woman whose birth fulfills an ancient prophecy. Jaenelle Angelline is born Witch. She is the \\"dream made flesh.\\" By the age of five she is extremely powerful, fiercely loyal, tremendously tender and capable of terribly destructive anger. This young girl-child is also an outcast amongst her own people and has no idea who or what she is or will be. Most of her birth family, unable to appreciate her exceptional powers and abilities, believe she is mad and she is periodically put in an asylum where horrors are performed on the children who are inmates there. When she is not institutionalized, Jaenelle travels between Realms into different lands, befriending the creatures who live there - from her adopted father, Saetan the High Lord of Hell, to her adopted brother, Prince Lucivar Yaslana, and Warlord Prince Daemon Sadi, who will become more important to her than any living soul. Also included in her inner circle are the demon-dead, unicorns, harpies, Healers and Black Widow Queens, Kindred, etc.. They will all impart wisdom to her and teach her aspects of the Craft. They all have important roles to play in the trilogy.<br />The three books trace Jaenelle's life, her education in the Craft, her developing friendships, the terrible hardships she undergoes in her attempts to discover who and what she really is and her efforts to escape from the evil forces that threaten to destroy her. When Jaenelle finally reaches maturity, makes her Offering to the Darkness and becomes Queen of the Dark Court at Ebon Askavi in the Realm of Karleer, she is faced with Realms in chaos and the threat of terrible war and destruction.

The author has crafted parallel tales of two young women, distantly related and separated by two generations. Anne, the story's narrator, travels to India to discover more about the mystery surrounding her grandfather's first wife, Olivia.<br />Douglas Rivers, an upper echelon English civil servant, married and brought his adored wife, Olivia, with him to India in 1923, during the British Raj. She was a beautiful, spoiled and spirited young woman, who found it difficult to adjust to life in the British colonial community of Satipur. Feeling suffocated by the inbred group she was forced to socialize with, Olivia longed for independence, intellectual stimulation and a more passionate life. She hoped that a baby would solve her problems but found it more difficult to become pregnant than she had thought. Shortly after their arrivel in India, Douglas, Olivia and some of the more important members of the community were invited to the palace of the Nawab of Khatm and she was immediately intrigued by the handsome, charismatic prince. He courted her friendship aggressively and then the friendship turned passionate. When faced with a crisis Olivia was forced to make life altering decisions which would have far reaching effects and cause scandal throughout British India and England that would last for generations.<br />Anne stays in the town where her grandfather and Olivia lived fifty years before. Trying to piece together the puzzle that was Olivia and discover what motivated her to change her life so drastically, Anne visits the places her &quot;step-grandmother&quot; frequented and interviews people who knew her or knew of her. She also reads the letters and journals that Olivia wrote so long ago, and oddly enough, Anne ventures into experiences similar to Olivia's adventures, but more acceptable in our modern time. Anne's spiritual and sensual journey in the 1970s parallels Olivia's as the color, heat, exotic landscapes, and people of India penetrate her western upbringing. Anne writes in her own diary: &quot;Fortunately, during my first few months here, I kept a journal, so I have some record of my early impressions. If I were to try and recollect them now, I might not be able to do so. They are no longer the same because I myself am no longer the same. India always changes people, and I have been no exception.&quot;<br />This short and delicately written novel packs a powerful punch and paints an extraordinary portrait of British colonials in India, with their sense of cultural and moral superiority over the local population. However, even more compelling and unusual, is the story of two women, generations apart, who follow similar paths under the spell of India.<br />JANAdern time.

Fiona Finnegan, a worker in a tea factory, wants to open a shop with her childhood love, costermonger's son Joe Bristow. Leaving the dirty cobbled streets and dark alleyways of their neighborhood behind, the two meet at the River Thames, when work and their daily struggle allow, to pool their savings and spin their dreams of a bright future and a better life together.<br />Then tragedy strikes the Bristow family - traumas, one after another, hit them hard and take a terrible toll.

However, she finds herself more attracted to the adventure of the trip and the discovery of the new country and cultures than to husband hunting. In Victorian England, young women who could not afford to 'come out,' or who did not find themselves married at the end of a season, would travel to India where Englishmen were plentiful due to the Honorable East India Company and the British army. Mariana is an attractive young woman, but not in the fashionable or traditional sense. Her looks are too vibrant and she is much too intelligent for her own good, military history being one of her favorite subjects. She chafes at the restrictions placed on her by English society and gets into many scrapes in the effort to satisfy her unquenchable curiosity and see sights usually forbidden to proper young ladies. After almost a year in India Mariana is no closer to the married state than when she arrived. Although there have been many suitors who have asked for her hand she has found none to be acceptable as her life's mate. Early on she acquired an enigmatic native tutor and has occupied herself with the study of Urdu, becoming quite proficient at reading, writing and speaking the language. These skills are to prove very useful given the novel's plot.<br />As it happens, 1838 is also the year that Great Britain attempts to invade and gain political control of Afghanistan. Before launching his Afghan campaign, Lord Auckland travels twelve hundred miles across India, with an enormous cavalcade - his entire government, a ten thousand man army, and animals, food, clothing, shelter and servants to take care of all necessary services - to meet with the dying Maharajah Ranjit Singh, Lion of the Punjab. Auckland's mission is to enlist the Maharajah's aid with the invasion and seal the pact by signing a treaty. Accompanying the Govenor-General are his two spinster sisters and Mariana Givens, their translator, appointed at the last minute when the regular translator took ill.<br />In the Punjab the Maharajah holds hostage an infant boy, Saboor, and his mother. He does this in order to control the baby's grandfather Shaikh Waiullah Karakoyia of Lahore, a renowned, visionary Sufi mystic and Saboor's father, Hassan, who serves as the Rajah's courier. One of the Rajah's jealous queens poisons Saboor's mother and the women of the harem mistreat and abuse the baby without his mother to protect him. It is likely that the boy, who supposedly has mystic powers similar to his grandfather's, will die if not removed from the harem. The Shaikh and his family are desperate to rescue Saboor. Mariana, the Shaikh and various others have had dreams which foretell that Mariana is destined to save and care for Saboor.<br />Author Thalassa Ali treats the reader to vivid descriptions of the cavalcade as it wends it's way across India, the traveling British and their customs, local soothsayers, scorpions and vipers, elephants, dancing girls, child kidnappers, a harem, Indian wedding rituals, eunuchs, a visionary mystic, suspense, conspiracy, intrigue and an unexpected romance. This is a book that is difficult to put down, although I did find the reading to be at a young adult level. Supposedly this is the first book in a trilogy. I look forward to Book Two.

And along with it a desire as commanding as any sexual compulsion that Antarctica was what I wanted, and therefore I had to have it.\\" So writes Jenny Diski in her strange, humorous and often painful memoir cum travelogue to the bottom of the world. \\"The Arctic would have been easier, but I had no desire to head north. I wanted white and ice for as far as the eye could see and I wanted it in the one place in the world that was uninhabited.\\"<br />Ms. Diski weaves two voyages into one here - the longed for trip she made a few years ago to the white land of snow and ice and a parallel journey into her own heart, soul and past. Her descriptions of her fellow travelers, boredom, group activities and various ports of call are often quite witty and caustic. Her take on the natural world, elephant seals, variety of birds, penguins, and the barren landscape in different shades of white are vivid and, at times, haunting.<br />Also explored in \\"Skating to Antarctica\\" is Ms. Diski's past - her suicidal and abusive parents, stays in psychiatric institutions, an almost lifelong estrangement from her mother and her own search of her \\"memory-hardened heart.\\" The reader is saved from depression at these revelations through the author's extraordinary use of humor at her desire to bury her childhood memories under, literally, tons of snow.<br />Diski's writing style is spare, clipped and very effective. Given some of the painful content it might sound ridiculous to write that I \\"enjoyed\\" the book - but I did. Her descriptive narrative of the trip to the world's southern-most continent are fascinating - not just another travel book, and her personal revelations are striking in their honesty.<br />JANA	2004-04-01

I cannot heap enough praise on Valerie Fitzgerald's superb historical novel &quot;Zemindar.&quot; I have always had an interest in India, especially during the period of the British Raj. I picked up a copy of this book at a used bookstore by chance, little knowing that it was to become one of my favorite novels. It is a beautifully written, impeccably researched, totally addictive read.<br />Set in India during the Raj, the author follows the lives of a newly married British couple on honeymoon to India, their young cousin, an Englishwoman who is companion to the bride, and the groom's half-brother, a European hereditary ruler - a zemindar - to his own fabulous kingdom, Hassanganj. This epic saga of love, war, tragedy and ultimate triumph is drawn from the author's personal experience. Ms. Fitzgerald's grandmother lived through the Indian Sepoy Mutiny, which is vividly recreated here. And the author, herself, spent her adolescence in Lucknow where her father was stationed during WWII. Her summers were spent on a zemindari estate similar to Oliver Erskine's extraordinary holdings. This personal perspective adds tremendously to the book's historical accuracy and provides the reader with an unusual, caring and honest perspective of the country, the native population and their British rulers.<br />I would be remiss if I did not mention that Ms. Fitzgerald not only provides a detailed and colorful portrait of India but she has created an exceptional cast of characters, both Indian and British, realistic and strong enough to inhabit the times in which they lived. Notable among them are Oliver Erskine - a combination of Edward Rochester (from Jane Eyre) and Rhett Butler (improbable but most effective and believable) - and Laura Hewitt. The novel is worth the read just to become acquainted with these two.<br />Along with &quot;The Siege of Krishnapur,&quot; &quot;Zemindar&quot; is one of the best period works of historical fiction. It won the Georgette Heyer Historical Novel Prize in 1981, selected from  scores of manuscripts that included M. M. Kaye's &quot;The Far Pavillions.&quot; Not to be missed!<br />JANAl Prize in 1981, selected from  scores of manuscripts that included M. M.

Kaye's extraordinary novel &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; combines historical fact with a wonderful love story set against the beauty and complexity of India during the British Raj. One of Ms. Kaye's gifts as a writer is her ability to create three-dimensional characters and plausibly insert them into historic events. Here she intertwines her cast of characters with history and through the microcosm of their lives we view the dramatic events of the past.<br />The action in M. M. Kaye's novel pivots around the Mutiny of 1857,&quot; also called the &quot;Sepoy Rebellion.&quot; Indian soldiers in the Bengal army of the British East India Company rose against their British rulers in May 1857 and the violent uprising quickly spread throughout British ruled India. &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; is the love story of an Anglo-Spanish heiress with vast land holdings in India and a political officer of the East India Company. The author intertwines the lives of these two central characters, and a large supporting cast, with historical events to create a wonderful epic novel.<br /><br />Ms. Kaye has written more than a historical novel here, although the book is full of romance, intrigue and the extraordinary colors of India. The author is the daughter of Anglo-Indians and writes with an obvious love of the country and all its varied cultures. She portrays many of the colonialist characters with the arrogant and superior attitudes so prevalent at the time and juxtaposes them and their narrowly focused lives against the realities of the world which surrounds them. These Victorian colonial attitudes, beliefs and zeal to spread their culture and religion appear to have made the uprising an inevitability.<br />I couldn't put this novel down and can't recommend it highly enough!<br />Jana	2004-03-24

The Indian soldiers, called sepoys, in the Bengal army of the British East India Company rose against their British rulers in Meerut in May 1857, and the violent uprising quickly spread throughout British ruled India. The action in J. G. Farrell's Booker Prize winning-novel revolves around the bloody siege of Krishnapur. Farrell's point of view is unusual because, instead of focusing on the uprising as a whole, or the siege in particular, he homes in on the British colonialists who administered and inhabited Krishnapur. Mr. Farrell did not need to contrast the English with the Indian population to illustrate the colonials' narrow-mindedness, absurdity or their attitudes which made the rebellion all but inevitable. Using superb wit, irony and satire Farrell clearly portrays his characters with their pretensions of cultural and religious superiority and their narrow focus on life.<br />Krishnapur's chief administrators, like those throughout the Empire, were seemingly impervious to warnings of the upcoming upheaval - and there were many. Even when news was brought to Krishnapur's Collector, Mr. Hopkins, of the savage rebellions in other parts of India, he remained almost surreally calm and detached. &quot;There was no cause for alarm and, besides, now that everyone had finished eating, a game of blind man's bluff was being called for.&quot;<br />Preparations for a long siege were finally made and all British subjects and Eurasians were offered shelter at the Residency. When the sepoys finally take-up arms and attack, Farrell's characters find themselves under siege from within and without as the long period of confinement, terrible heat, dwindling food and water supplies, disease and death take their toll. These besieged middle class English men and women are given the opportunity to show the stuff they're made of in this extreme situation and some, remarkably, rise to the occasion, surprising even themselves.<br />&quot;The Siege of Krishnapur&quot; has become on of my favorite novels. Farrell's extraordinary writing, his imagery, eye for detail, dark humor and ability to maintain suspense are outstanding. He creates and develops characters as individuals and portrays their growth and/or decline with the eye and intensity of an artist. Above all, Mr. Farrell's view of the British middle class, who ruled an empire and were confronted with history in the making, deeply effected me - and made me laugh too.

Three different woman with different points of view paint virtually the same scenes, and the same memories, viewed through different eyes. The reader only begins to see the whole picture when all the parts are combined and can be viewed as a whole.<br />Ms. Ellis writes this penetrating character study with wit, irony and, at times, great poignancy. Margaret, a young English woman returns home after a dramatic and traumatic visit with family friends in Egypt. She finds herself suddenly, unhappily engaged to the man next door, Syl, who is twice her age. Margaret lives with her domineering mother whose husband abandoned her for another years ago. Syl lives with his mother, Mrs. Monro, a strong figure who also had difficulties in her marriage and is aware that death is not far off. Lili, an old friend of Margaret's mother, enters center stage, acting as a catalyst to stir up memories, secrets and events to come.<br />Ms. Ellis insightfully explores the human drama and the various forms of love with sensitivity and a unique gentleness. Her character development is extraordinary. She creates three totally different women, interconnected through friendship, marriage and love, and gives them tremendous depth.

From the time I learned to read until my preteen years my favorite books were L. Frank Baum's Oz Books. I was an extremely avid reader but, for me, no other stories could compare with the magical world that Baum created. His characters and their adventures fueled my childhood fantasies like no others. In turn, these books became favorites of my daughter's. And this book, \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" is the one that started it all.<br />As most folks know, an enormous cyclone suddenly hit young Dorothy Gale's home in Kansas, resulting in the extraordinary transportation of said home, girl and dog across time and space to the wondrous land of Oz. The house fell on a wicked witch and killed her, with dire future consequences for Dorothy and Company. Dorothy is directed to travel to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz to help her return to Kansas. On the way, she meets and befriends a Scarecrow (who desires brains), a Tin Woodman (who craves a heart), and a Lion (who wants to possess courage). And thus the famous adventures begin, which have been translated into many languages for children around the world. If there was ever a classic children's book - this is it.<br />Baum's narrative honors the ideals of home, heart, intellect, and courage. He introduces the reader to wizards, witches, winged monkeys, the Munchkins, and the beloved characters who have become cultural icons: Dorothy, Toto, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion. This edition features W. W. Denslow's illustrations, the original art that graced Baum's books, and my favorites.<br />This is a wonderful, non-abridged edition of one of the best stories ever told.

Karim and Raheen have been the closest of friends since they shared a crib as infants. Growing up together in a wealthy Karachi neighborhood during the 1980s, they finish each other's sentences, speak in anagrams, dream each other's dreams and are true soulmates. The two are sure of the fact that, &quot;If I wasn't me, you wouldn't be you.&quot; &quot;Can angels lie spine to spine?&quot; Raheen wonders to herself. &quot;If not, how they must envy us humans.&quot;<br />Raheen's and Karim's parents were once engaged to each other: her father to his mother, his father to her mother. There is a long buried secret, a family mystery, behind the fiancee swap - one that threatens to sever the magical bond that unites these young people as they become adults.<br />Filled with wry humor and wit, this is a novel about a friendship predestined to turn into love. The metaphor of maps and identity is embodied by the character of Karim, who wants to be a mapmaker, obsessed with finding the roots and meaning of geographical belonging. However, the author Kamila Shamsie also writes about Pakistan, political violence, and growing up rich and comfortable in a land that is always on the edge of riot and despair.<br />Ms. Shamsie writes a lyrical, impassioned narrative, lush with detail. Her novel is a love song, of sorts, to Karachi. Set against the backdrop of Pakistan's bloody civil war, it is a story of a country at war and of hearts at war, where the intricacies of love and intimacy are deftly explored.

The Germans were pressured into conducting the attack by Francisco Franco, the Spanish rebel leader. Guernica was approximately 10 miles behind the front lines and was crowded with retreating soldiers and refugees. The day was the normal market day for the town and surrounding area. Local citizens crowded the marketplace, doing their weekly shopping.<br />Two-thirds of the of the explosives dropped by the German bombers were 500 and 250 kilogram high explosive bombs and 20 pound anti-personnel bombs; one-third were 2 pound incendiary bombs. Approximately 1,654 people may have been killed and another 889 wounded in the attack. Reports indicate as much as 70 percent of the town was destroyed, with most of the rest heavily damaged. Fires ignited during the attack are reported to have burned for three days. Guernica fell to General Francisco Franco's advancing army two days later.<br />From his home in Paris, Pablo Picasso, Spanish artist and master painter, translated the shock, horror, sorrow and outrage he shared with his fellow countrymen and most of the world's people, into a gigantic black and white mural he titled Guernica.<br />Russell Martin tells the complete story of Guernica, starting with the events that lead to the creation of the painting and following Guernica as it moved from museum to museum, becoming ever more the important symbol it has become today - and one of the 20th century's greatest masterpieces. Martin examines Spain under Franco's fascist regime, the storied private life of Picasso, the messages of protest within the painting, and the controversy that surrounded Guernica.<br />This painting symbolizes all that is horrible and evil in war, and the resulting suffering that occurs in wars everywhere. \\"Picasso's War\\" has been named a Book Sense 76 selection of the US Association of Independent Booksellers.

This extraordinary historical WWII thriller is the fictional account of a true story. \\"Plan Fortitude\\" actually existed. It's goal was to influence the decision making of the German High Command by supplying their agents and other Nazi information sources with disinformation. The men who conceived and executed the plan reported directly to Winston Churchill and few were privy to it, including the British and American Secret Services. The intelligence involved was and still remains one of the war's best kept secrets and without its successful implementation the Normandy invasion would have failed. Most of the men and women who gave their lives so that the plan, and thus the invasion, would succeed will never be recognized for their valor and patriotism. Without their sacrifices the world would be a very different place today.<br />Larry Collins, co-author of \\"Is Paris Burning?,\\" another fictional factual account of the last days of the Nazi occupation of Paris, takes the reader deep into the world of espionage, deception and betrayal that paved the way for D-Day. The Allies knew that Hitler had enough tanks and troops placed strategically in France to overwhelm the Allies and prevent an invasion of the continent. Their best bet for success was to lead Hitler and his generals to believe that the invasion at Normandy was only a preliminary to the major event which would take place a few days later near Calais. Thus Hitler would keep the bulk of his forces in reserve for the shadowy Calais invasion, which was never to come.<br />To pull-off this deadly game, with the highest of stakes at risk, imaginary armies, barracks, vehicles and buildings were constructed - all resembling stage props from close-up, but not from the air. Cryptographers, spies, counter spies, double and triple agents were employed, and sometimes betrayed, tortured and killed by the Gestapo for the good of the Allied cause. Catherine Pradier, a highly intelligent and very beautiful woman of half French, half British parentage, wanted very much to do something to actively serve both her countries. Her godfather, a British peer, was able to pull the necessary strings to grant her wish. He would never have done so had Catherine not possessed tremendous strength of character and courage. Catherine was trained to be \\"dropped\\" into Occupied France and assist in the sabotage of France's German-run arms industry and cause as much chaos behind German lines as possible. At best, she could hope to do her job successfully. Worse case scenario, she would be captured, tortured and killed or deported to a German concentration camp. The British government's position was clear, \\"Women are entitled to join in the defense of our common beliefs as are men. The war is total, not restricted to men alone.\\" And, in fact, women were better able to move around Occupied France than men. They were less suspect and they couldn't be swept off the streets and shipped to Germany for forced labor. Catherine's job was to function as radio operator and courier for a French resistance chief. The contact who first meets Catherine when her Lysander plane lands in a French field is an agent, code name Paul. His history of espionage and counter espionage is too complicated to do justice to here. The two are immediately drawn to each other, but clearly their professional duties and obligation to their country come before everything else.<br />Many of the large cast of characters are historical figures: Winston Churchill, Adolf Hitler, Dwight D. Eisenhower, various generals, government officials, etc.. The research that Mr. Collins has done is phenomenal and makes the novel read like a journalistic account at times. The fictional characters are no less intriguing and some do take their point of departure, according to the author, from actual characters who did exist. The roles they played, the work they did, are similar to the work done by their real life counterparts in the war.<br />This is one of thebest works of fiction I have read about WWII. I simply could not put this book down. The characters have depth and the events they were swept up in are thrilling, intense and terrifying. I was left with a feeling of disquiet when I finished the novel, thinking of the real men and women involved in the actual subterfuge, never knowing the critical importance of their jobs and efforts.

Jenny, his wife has dedicated all of their twenty-five year marriage to fulfilling her husband's needs, bringing up their children, acting as his research assistant, editor and Girl Friday, to such an extent that some feel her name should be on the title page of her husband's best selling books, along with his.

Convinced he is going to die, he wants no medical intervention, no life as an as an invalid, and so he considers suicide - a thought he becomes obsessed with.

Thinking a change of scene from the New England cold might help, Jenny speaks with a friend who winters in Key West and decides to propose the idea of a few months in the tropics to her husband.<br />The characters the Walkers meet during their stay, the warmer southern environment and unusual Key West holiday ambiance and culture, open Jennie's eyes and senses to a world of choices previously unavailable to her.

Thomas E. Dewey was highly favored to win against Harry Truman. The Democrats were so badly split they didn't think Truman had a chance against Dewey. Although there was little money available, Truman's whistle stop campaigns drew crowds of farmers and small town folks shouting the now famous, &quot;Give 'em Hell, Harry.&quot; But Dewey was the front runner all the way to the polls in November.<br />For the people of Owosso, Michigan, Dewey's hometown, it is one of the most extraordinary moments in the town's history - their native son is most likely going to become President of the United States. They discuss the prospects for newfound fame as well as political issues throughout the book. Although Dewey drops into the story a time or two, this is not a novel about the elections or the candidates. The hullabaloo does provide a wonderful backdrop for this humorous, nostalgic novel about the citizens of Owosso and a love triangle, in particular. The local love story mirrors the national election contest and, almost wistfully, captures a period in American history and culture that is gone forever.

He ranks right up there with John le Carre, Ken Follett and Len Deighton when it comes to well written, original, intelligent espionage thrillers. I also enjoy Littell's use of irony and his dry sense of humor.<br />Charlie Heller is a quiet, unassuming man with a quiet, unassuming job in a back office of a large corporation. He is a crack cryptographer for the CIA - The Company. Since his boyhood he has been fascinated with untangling codes and he considers himself fortunate that he is able to pay the rent by doing a job that he so enjoys. As an added attraction, he gets to use the CIA's super-sophisticated computer, with which he pursues his hobby. Heller is a Shakespeare &quot;denialist&quot; and searches all of the great bard's works trying to find a cryptogram which will reveal their true author. So, with a well paid job, an unusual and most interesting hobby, and the love of a wonderful woman, his  beloved fiancee Sarah Diamond, Charlie Heller is a happy man.<br />Unfortunately, Sarah is brutally murdered by terrorists in a surprise attack at the American Embassy in West Germany. (The novel is set in the 1970s). Charlie, informed of the news by his sympathetic superiors, is bereft. His feelings of loss and subsequent depression are clearly portrayed by Littell, as is the terrible bitterness he feels when he learns that The Company will not pursue the terrorists who committed the crime, even though their identity and location is known. They are behind the Iron Curtain in Czechoslovakia. Heller becomes driven by a need for revenge, which his Company psychiatrist notes is &quot;very therapeutic.&quot; With his back against the wall, Heller manages to manipulate the masters of manipulation and move toward his goal of assassinating the terrorists responsible for Sarah's death. He is an amateur - &quot;someone who thinks that if something is worth doing, it may be worth doing badly&quot; - working against some of the best people in the field of espionage and assassination. And they all want to take Heller out with extreme prejudice.<br />This book is a real page turner. I could not put it down. Heller is an extremely well developed character and his motivation and talents are well thought-out and make perfect sense in the storyline. The minor characters are also terrific. His Czech contact is a brilliant addition to the plot and her constant malaprops bring much needed comic relief to many taut, tense situations. If you enjoy this book, you may want to check-out Robert Littell's &quot;The Company.&quot; It is another excellent novel.

Author John Burnham Schwartz writes with spare elegant prose about disparate characters who come together for a time, to love and to betray. But \\"Claire Marvel\\" is also a character study and a commentary on how insecurity, poor timing and lack of decisiveness can destroy the closest relationships. It delves into the consequences of action and lack of action, the ability to be courageous in life, to act on conscience, and the growth of character.<br />Claire Marvel and Julian Rose meet serendipitously during a rain storm. He seeks cover at the Fogg Art Museum where Claire is waiting for the rain to abate under an umbrella the color of buttercups. The two are graduate students at Harvard, he in political science, she in art, studying the Pre-Raphaelites. Claire is a free spirit, very visual, absorbed by images, color and line with an artist's sensibility - much more than that of an art historian. She is a \\"traveler who through circuitous wandering had stumbled upon an unchartered place beyond explanation.\\" Julian is a believer of empirical truth. \\"It is hard for him to bump up against anything without immediately supplying or reaching for definition.\\" They both carry the baggage of their dysfunctional families. And yet they are kindred spirits and come together effortlessly.<br />Claire's father is dying and asks her to spend some time in France at a small house in the countryside where he had spent some of the happiest moments of his life. She asks Julian to accompany her. Their time together is idyllic. However, flaws in Julian's character cause problems and missed opportunities. The novel explores his past and the reasons for his development as a passive, almost cowardly, man. So the novel becomes much more than a love story.<br />I found the parts of the novel dealing with Julian's relationship with his doctorial advisor to be fascinating. Julian is writing a dissertation on the various incarnations of the Progressive Party. His advisor, Carl Davis, is a powerful professor with close ties to Ronald Regan and the Republican Party. Julian disagrees with Davis' politics but is drawn to his authority and powerful presence. This relationship play a major part in the storyline.<br />Some critics have compared \\"Claire Marvel\\" to Erich Segal's novel \\"Love Story.\\" The only commonalties I found are that Julian and Claire attend Harvard and live in Cambridge for a period. There is little \\"schmaltz\\" or sentimentality here. The prose and the author's use of language is often quite beautiful. The tension is taut, as the story unfolds through memory and direct confrontation with the past. I was very moved by the author's compassionate exploration of relationships, passion, regret and loss.

The novel's strength lies in the relationship between the two protagonists and their witty, feisty dialogue. The plot is predictable, however, although it did not deter from my enjoyment of the story.<br />Jocelyn Dudley, Duke of Tresham, is a rake who because of his numerous involvements with women, many of them married, finds himself fighting more duels than most. During one of these challenges the duel, with pistols, is disrupted when a young woman accidentally passing by the field of battle cries out and diverts Tresham's attention from the business at hand. Consequently he is shot in the leg. He is outraged at the interruption by a mere servant, a milliner's assistant. She loses her position because the duel makes her late for work and when she demands that Tresham write a note to explain her tardiness he insists that the she act as his nurse for the three week period of his convalescence.<br />The young woman is really not the servant, Jane Ingleby, but a lady, Sara Illingsworth, who has fled her home and guardian because she mistakenly believes she has killed a man while defending her honor. Tresham is drawn as much to Sara/Jane's strong character, spirit, intelligence and wit as he is to her beauty. And she, of course, falls for this handsome alpha male whom she refuses to allow to dominate her. Their growing relationship is a delight and Ms Balogh describes their love with great sensuality and humor.<br />The novel also deals with the enormous differences in social classes during the Regency period. This is a light read but one that is hard to put down because of the wonderful characters.<br />JANA	2004-03-11

Ms. Simons portrays here, with great sensitivity and realism, the terrible suffering that the citizens of Leningrad experienced during the Nazi siege and their struggle to survive. She also probes the intricacies of family relationships, the ties that bind, especially in times of terrible hardship. Simons alludes frequently to Alexander Pushkin's tragic epic poem, \\"The Bronze Horseman,\\" from which this novel takes its title.<br />Seventeen year old Tatiana Metanova was wearing her \\"splendid white dress with red roses\\" and enjoying an ice cream cone when she looked up and saw a soldier staring at her with \\"an expression she had never seen before.\\" Thus begins the intense and complex relationship between Tatiana and her Alexander (Shura) Belov, a First Lieutenant in the Soviet Army. Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin's Foreign Minister, had announced the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union only a few hours before the two young people meet for the first time.<br />Tatiana lives in a tiny two room flat with her sister and best friend Dasha, her twin brother, parents and grandparents. Her sense of family is very strong, especially since she has never had a truly close relationship with anyone other than her kin. When Tatiana brings Alexander home for the first time she discovers that her sister Dasha had already met him in a club and had bragged about him as her new boyfriend. Dasha takes what had been a casual romance very seriously and believes she is in love. Alexander does not reciprocate her feelings, however. Tatiana has been very sheltered by her family and is quite naive and very innocent. Slight, blonde and lovely, she is thought to be the most fragile member of the family. Tatiana and Alexander continue to see each other, keeping their relationship a secret from everyone. As the love and friendship grows between the couple, Tatiana becomes determined to sacrifice her own happiness for her sister's.<br />The consequences of war, bombings, starvation and death, overwhelm the city, and take a terrible toll, especially on Tatiana's family. Alexander tries his best to protect them but he has a terrible secret that must be kept at any price, and this secret complicates the intertwined relationships even more.<br />This is an epic tale that I found almost impossible to put down. It takes unexpected twists and turns that highlight the horrors of war and the inner strength of Tatiana and Alexander, as well as the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the characters. At first I was impatient with Tatiana's obsession to \\"give\\" Alexander to her sister. However, as Ms. Simons continues to develop her character the motivation becomes more clear and does make sense.<br />The author writes with great passion of love, war and survival. Ultimately I think this novel is as much about the human spirit's will to survive as it is about love. The dialogue between Tatiana and Alexander, as well as their love scenes are beautifully written. I will admit to sobbing more than a few times before the final page. I highly recommend this wonderfully romantic and tragic historical novel.<br />JANAe, Tatiana becomes determined to sacrifice her own happiness for her sister's.<br />The consequences of war, bombings, starvation and death, overwhelm the city, and take a terrible toll, especially on Tatiana's family.

In this case, the book is &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; by Charlotte Bronte, thus the title. And the reader does, in fact, meet Mr. Rochester, Mrs. Fairfax, Bertha Mason Rochester, Grace Poole, and even Pilot the dog through the experience and eyes of our heroine Thursday Next, Special Operative in literary detection. Unfortunately we do not meet Ms. Eyre, as the novel is told in the first person and no one wants to distract her from her mission of forwarding the plot.<br />What world has the reader stepped into? Where exactly are we that such things are possible? Jasper Fforde's London of 1985 is familiar in many ways. Her citizens look much as they do now, although styles have a retro look. People watch TV, listen to their favorite music, go to work each day to pay the rent and they still fall in love...and out of it. However, the computer chip has not been invented nor has the jet engine, so people's eyes don't glaze over staring at computer monitors. They travel long distances by ship or dirigibles. The Crimean War, between England and Czarist Russia is in its 131st year - England's Viet Nam taken to greater depths...or heights. The Russian Revolution never happened, so no Cold War, Lenin, or Stalin...but serfs are still around, I guess. The nation's favorite pastime is, of all things, literature. These folks read big time! Many change their names to John Milton, Charles Dickens, George Gordon, Lord Byron, etc., and Shakespeare denialists abound.  This is a time when people can literally get lost in a book...or poem. Wales is an independent country, The People's Republic of Wales and England is a police state.<br />Thursday Next, is a tough but tender lady with a dry, wry sense of humor, and a veteran of a very bloody Crimean campaign in which she lost her beloved brother. Her job as &quot;operative grade I&quot; for SO-27, the Literary Detective Division of the Special Operations Network is to track down stolen manuscripts and spot forgeries. She is recruited by SpecOps to track down Acheron Hades, one of the world's most heinous criminals. He had been her professor at university and she had successfully avoided his numerous attempts at seduction, perhaps the only girl who got away. Thus Ms. Next is able to resist the effects of his hypnotic voice and persuasive abilities to this day. Hades has stolen a device that allows him to enter books and cause great mischief...perhaps irrevocable damage to great literature, like absconding with characters and altering plots forever. We all know by the title that Jane Eyre becomes a target. And the mystery and adventures commence.<br />I am not a fan of sci-fi, fantasy or alternate history, but this book is a blast, especially for those who love their lit. The jokes, puns, allusions are very clever and often made me laugh out loud. Fervent Baconians constantly feud with staunch Shakespeareans about who wrote the world's greatest plays. Shakespeare's Richard III plays every Friday night at a local theater, a la &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; with audience participation. Thursday's dad, a rogue ChronoGuard, travels through time haphazardly to avoid capture but always visits his daughter, even if just for seconds.<br />Mr. Fforde's writes tight, skilled, imaginative prose. He has come up with a remarkable character in Ms. Next, and since this book has been destined to be part of a series, we will be reading more about her and her slightly mad adventures.

Claire and James Fraser have weathered more storms than most, crossed oceans and centuries to make a life together, and this last novel is the culmination of all their struggles. We were first introduced to Jamie and Claire right after Claire made the voyage from peaceful 20th century Scotland to 18th century Scotland and total mayhem. We witnessed passion, love and friendship grow between this couple as they began married life, and experienced adventure, adversity and attempted to alter history. Now they have finally settled in North Carolina along with their daughter Brianna, her husband Roger, their son Jemmie, many of their family members and friends from Scotland, including most of Jamies fellow prisoners from Ardsmuir and hundreds of refugees in exile in the wake of the Jacobite rebellion.<br />The novel opens as &quot;The Fiery Cross,&quot; used to summon highlanders to war, is lit again at the 1770 Gathering of Clans in the Royal Colony of North Carolina. William Tryon, North Carolina's governor, has asked Jamie to gather men to form a militia in order to put down a local uprising - one of the many precursors to the Revolutionary War.<br />Unlike Ms. Gabaldon's other novels, this is not a book focused on adventures and conflict, with many plot twists and turns, although there is no lack of excitement here. &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot; is all about character growth, interpersonal relationships, survival in the wilderness, and the mature love of a middle-aged couple who adore each other. We have witnessed Claire and Jamie live, work and love, almost as one entity - now they experience what it is like to be family elders, surrounded by loved ones, and wrestle with commonplace chores and leadership issues. Claire, now a beautiful matron in her 50s, spends much of her time utilizing her physician's skills and searching for ways to bring 20th century science to her 18th century practice. James is the founder of the Fraser's Ridge community and acts as an unofficial clan chief to all the families who look to him for leadership. Brianna and Roger, and Fergus and Marsali are young couples coping with a heavy daily work load and parenting. This is a period when backbreaking work, from first light to last, is necessary for survival.<br />Many may not care for this book as much as they did for the others, but I believe that this may be our last glimpse of the Frasers and am glad to see them settled with their loved ones and still very much in love with each other. The Fraser family, especially Claire and James, have come to mean so much to me. They are aging and Ms. Gabaldon clearly shows the toll that the years and their plights have taken. Now she allows her characters to experience some stability, home life and joy of family.<br />Diana Gabaldon has an imagination for which I will always be grateful, and she is as skilled a writer as there ever was. She develops characters so that they truly come to life and remain with the reader forever - no small accomplishment. Her ability to capture the essence of a loving relationship, whether between lovers, spouses, parents and children, or friends can easily move her readers to tears.

A terrorist group, The Black Death, hijacked Air France Flight 64 to New York in September, 1987. During the five day period of negotiations between the terrorists and various governments' officials, the children on the plane were released and held in safety, waiting for the inevitable outcome, and longing for their parents' safe return. The reunion never took place and all remaining passengers met a horrific death. Thanks to the miracle of TV, the children were exposed to it all in living color. Needless to say, they were scarred for life by the events of this period, as they would have been marked by the scars of a terrible plague or a war.<br />Many of these surviving children have stayed in touch with each other over the years, seeking emotional support and comfort. They maintain a website on which they request information concerning the doomed flight, even though much of the information is classified. They all suffer psychological traumas and an obsession with the tragedy. Two of the survivors in particular, Samantha and Lowell, attempt to piece together the events leading up to the hijacking. As they do so, many of the key passengers' stories are revealed. Espionage, politics, betrayal, and love affairs all play their part in the convoluted web of Flight 64 and its demise. It is a web that links together, forever, the passengers and their families.<br />Janette Turner Hospital explores a terrorist incident, government cover-ups, the moral implications of collateral damage when weighed against &quot;the good of the nation,&quot; and the dangers involved when choosing the lesser of many evils. The novel is filled with believable clandestine plots and double-crosses. The narrative spirals back and forward in time, disorienting the reader, as the characters are disoriented, weaving past and present together in the search for the truth.<br />Ms. Turner Hospital illustrates her storyline with highly effective historical and literary allusions, quoting Daniel Defoe, Albert Camus, Robert Browning, Lewis Carroll, Jorge Luis Borges, the Book of Job, Boccaccio, and Shakespeare, among others.

Tom Segev's history of Palestine from the last years of World War I to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 reads like an epic novel. He introduces the reader to an extraordinary cast of real life characters - Arabs, Jews and British - certainly as rich and varied as anyone met in great fiction. Gripping historical and personal accounts of life in this long disputed land are documented from Khalil al-Sakakini's near fatal decision to harbor a Jewish family in 1917 Ottoman Palestine, to many accounts  of the British liberation, (just days later), and a description of General Sir Edmund Allenby's entrance to Jerusalem, on foot, along with Lawrence of Arabia and representatives of France, Italy and the United States. Segev fills his pages with the documented actions and thoughts of history's movers and shakers - Chiam Weizmann, Lloyd George, David Ben Gurion, Haj Amin al-Husseini, Muhammed, Iz-al-Din-al-Qassam, as well as those of &quot;everyman&quot; caught-up in the whirlwind of history in-the-making. These accounts, along with anecdotes like the visits to the holy land by the likes of Rudyard Kipling, Albert Einstein, etc., make this book such a terrific and worthwhile read.<br />However, although Segev's historical documentation is impressive, his interpretation of history is most unusual. He maintains that the British were highly supportive in the formation and creation of the Jewish State, with some resistance during the period of the British Mandate. He also discounts the importance of the Holocaust in facilitating Israeli Statehood. His interpretations of Great Britain's pro-Zionist stance and motivation is highly controversial, and to be perfectly frank, I have to read more from other historians before I can put Mr. Segev's ideas into perspective. Don't be put off by the author's historical conclusions, however. The narrative does make for an interesting read.<br />Tom Segev is one of Israel's most notable historians and journalists and offers here a dramatic and well written account of two nationalist movements that will hopefully form the basis of two separate countries and populations, living side-by-side, and flourishing in peace one day.

The two men travel together to Scotland to meet and gather the clans in preparation for the arrival of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, Bonnie Prince Charlie, and war.<br />When they reach the MacGregor home in the Highlands, Brigham is prepared to meet Coll's family, but he is taken totally unaware by the beautiful, vibrant, hot tempered Serena MacGregor, Coll's eldest sister. Sparks fly and tempers flare, as Serena makes her views known about all Englishmen, and Brig, the 'Sassenach,' in particular. As war plans are fleshed out, Brig and Serena fall in lust and then in love. The characters are wonderful and the mixture of humor and intensity, with the historical background, make for a winning combination.<br />The secondary characters, the MacGregor clan, its retainers, and Brigham's valet really add to the novel and make the story come to life. They each have their own tale to tell and their presence does much more than act as filler between the chapters where Serena and Brig interact.<br />&quot;Rebellion&quot; is a wonderful light read. I went through it in an evening and became quickly absorbed. If you are a fan of historical fiction, and/or Scottish romances, as I am, that is definitely a plus. ENJOY!!<br />JANA	2004-02-25

After reading Charles Palliser's &quot;Quincunx&quot; I felt as if I had participated in a triathlon. This is not a book for those with short attention spans or for those who lack patience. Although I usually like epic novels, if the plot is interesting and varied and the characters well developed, I found this novel very difficult to get through. The book has been hyped as &quot;Dickensian&quot; but the only similarities to the work of Charles Dickens' lie in its length, 781 densely printed pages, its setting, Victorian England, and many of its characters who are the poor and disenfranchised. The quality of writing, storyline and character development are not at all comparable to that of the great novelist.<br />Young John Huffam, our hero, and his mother have been hiding from their enemies from the time of his birth. John is heir to vast lands and a title, which seemingly every character in the book lays claim to. There is a lost will and a secret codicil that officially proclaim John the rightful heir to enormous wealth. The entire novel is based on his search for his identity and for his hereditary rights. Parallel to this purpose are the many attempts to thwart him, usually by greedy family members he has no knowledge of. They either want John dead, or alive and in their power. For the duration of the novel John barely escapes from one near-death experience after another. In spite of his obvious intelligence and precocity, he is totally blind to all clues about his true history and dilemma. He naively trusts everyone, even after numerous betrayals. He bumbles from one mishap to another, with apparently half of London's population following him and wishing him ill.<br />The plot is very simplistic, and the author's attempts to make the storyline more complex, with various and sundry twists and turns, fail because, with all their intricacy, there are just too many coincidences here to form a credible plot. Even Houdini couldn't have escaped from some of the episodes young John manages to extricate himself from.<br />The character development is nil. John's mother is probably the shallowest, least likable fictional character I have met in years. With all her problems, I found it difficult to summon much sympathy for her. I believe this is because she is extremely flat, one dimensional, as are all the book's characters, including John. The book introduces us to many villains, very few decent folks and a few martyrs. There is little variation and even less humanity and basic decency here. A key at the back of the book lists all the characters and I found myself using it constantly, much to my surprise. I have read most of Dickens, and many Russian authors who cast their novels with multitudes of characters. I do not remember ever using a list to keep track of them. When I thought about this I realized that because Mr. Palliser's characters lacked the most basic development, they never came to life for me and thus my memory problem.<br />I did give the book 3 stars, mainly because the author managed  to persuade me to complete it. And completing the read was indeed a difficult process, but I did want to find out the conclusion. I suppose I could have just read the last page.<br />For those who are interested, a 'Quincunx' is an arrangement of five objects with one at each corner of a rectangle or square and one at the center. The heraldic device used by all members of John's family took the form of a quincunx.<br />JANAodes young John manages to extricate himself from.<br />The character development is nil.

Ms. Penman succeeds brilliantly in bringing these men and women, and the causes they fought for, to life in these books. She is a remarkably gifted writer.

He was a warrior, great leader and politician who despised Henry III for his incompetence and the favoritism he displayed for the foreigners in his court. Henry was bankrupting England and estranging the peerage. Ahead of his time, Simon also espoused the idea that the common man deserved a voice in government. England was in the midst of civil war as factions split between Henry and his son and heir Edward. When Edward realized that de Montfort's reforms would limit his power and the Divine Right of Kings, he turned against him and in the bloody battle of Evesham, defeated him, with horrifying consequences for the entire de Montfort family.<br />During this same period there was terrible unrest in Wales, including civil war. Charismatic Llewelyn Farr, Prince of Northern Wales had fought to unite his country's nobility and provide a strong front against the English. His grandson, Lwellyn ap Gruffyd, became Llewelyn's heir and inherited the staunch commitment to keep Wales united. The Welsh leader was a cousin to both the English King and the de Montfort family and was betrothed to marry Simon de Montfort's daughter, Ellen. When de Monfort lost all at Evesham, Welsh politics changed. As Wales sought to consolidate its position and prevent being absorbed into a greater England, the new Prince's brothers were determined to wage war against him to gain power of their own and sacrificed Welsh independence in the process.<br />This is a complex and tragic saga of historic characters, politics, intrigues, betrayals, bloody battles and wars, romance, lust, power struggles, princesses held captive, revenge and forgiveness. Yet once begun, this extraordinary epic is almost impossible to put down. Ms. Penman portrays Wales, its people, culture and landscape vividly with glorious detail. It is fascinating to become involved with the characters and realize how linked they are by ties of blood - common ancestry. Not only is Welsh history tied to that of England's, but the royal families are linked as are their descendants. Ms. Penman joins the histories and characters of these two countries to give the reader, not just a superb tale but a look at the bigger historical picture also.<br /><br />This is truly one of the best historical novels I have ever read, and the trilogy by Ms. Penman is absolutely outstanding.

A young man in his mid-twenties, he returned to England in 1232 seeking restitution of his family lands from King Henry III, John's son. He wound up marrying Henry's sister, Eleanor Plantagenet and risking the King's and Church's wrath by doing so. De Montfort, who became Earl of Leicester, was a warrior, great leader and politician. He despised Henry III for his incompetence and the favoritism he displayed for the foreigners in his court. Henry was bankrupting England and estranging the peerage. Far ahead of his time, Simon de Montfort also espoused the idea that the common man deserved a voice in government. England was on the verge of civil war as factions split between Henry and his son and heir Edward. The collision of blood ties, politics and war, shifting allegiances, along with the pageantry and drama of life in the Middle Ages, make this novel hard to put down.<br />Intertwined with the story of Simon de Montfort is that of Welsh Prince Llewelyn Farr, who united the Welsh nobility against the English. Wales was also in a state of civil unrest at the time, as Llewelyn had just died and his sons were fighting for leadership and power, thereby losing everything their father had gained to the English. What makes the Welsh part of the story even more interesting, is that not only is Welsh history linked to that of England's, but the royal families, Kings John and Henry, and Prince Llewelyn's are linked by blood.

Marsha Canham's fictional account of Lady Anne Farquharson Moy and her contribution to the Jacobite cause in Scotland, (1745), makes for extraordinary reading. The lady and her cause are part of the tragic history of the Scottish uprising with its goal to put Charles Edward Stuart, (Bonnie Prince Charlie), on the throne of Scotland and England. Beginning just before the doomed Battle of Culloden Moor, Ms. Canham sweeps the reader back to 18th century Scotland, with its diverse clans, intrigues, politics, adventure and romance.<br />Anne's family, the Farquharsons, were fiercely loyal to the Stuarts. Anne, who grew up in staunch Jacobite surroundings, was a strong individual whose brothers had taught to wield a sword and fight. In fact, she was known more for her skills with weapons than with embroidery and book learning. Called &quot;Wild Rhuad Annie,&quot; she married refined Angus Moy, chief of Clan Chattan, a man who had been educated on the continent and had little in common with many of Scotland's leaders. He did not want to associate himself or his clan with the Stuart mission. Moy believed from the beginning that the rebellion would fail and didn't want his people to lose their lives or land as a result of Civil War. Therefore he pledged himself to fight with the English.<br />Anne could not maintain her honor, as a Farquharson, or as Moy's wife, by keeping silent and remaining at home. Armed with a petition that declared her the clan leader in her husband's absence, she called the Jacobite members of the Chattan Clan together and led them into battle. She was their &quot;Colonel Anne,&quot; and she made her handsome and gallant clansman, John MacGillivray, her Captain.<br />This story is quite complex, as are the characters, and Ms. Canham has done a remarkable job in fleshing out the people and the issues of the period. Angus Moy's dilemma was very real. He was never meant to be the leader of a clan and was not educated as such. When he found himself suddenly responsible for the lives of so many people he took the responsibility to heart. He may very well have been a Jacobite supporter himself, but was determined to keep his clan safe from the disastrous results of a doomed cause. Anne, who loved her husband, felt shame as she watched him throw in his hand with the despised English. She also knew that, in the heat of the moment, many of her husband's clan wanted to fight for the Stuarts. Anne, with her strong character, did not want to remain in a passive woman's role while the world was exploding around her. She had a cause she believed in and wanted to play a part in history.<br />Marsha Canham, one of my favorite authors, has outdone herself with this wonderful historical novel. She was fascinated with the Jacobites and historical figures Anne and Angus Moy, John MacGillivray, Gilles MacBean, Lochiel and Alexander Cameron and Fearchar Farquharson. She wrote that researching and writing this novel was a &quot;labor of love.&quot; The results provide an incredible glimpse into the past and into the life of a unique and courageous heroine who certainly deserves a story of her own.<br />JANAly responsible for the lives of so many people he took the responsibility to heart.

The two are devoted to each other, having escaped from a life of squalor and poverty to make their way in the New World. They are aided by Governor Peter Stuyvesant after Lucas performs a successful surgery on him to remove a kidney stone. The future seems filled with promise until a terrible betrayal causes a rift between the siblings that will impact generations to come.<br />In a series of eight segments, author Beverly Swerling unfolds the lives of the original Turners and their descendants, as Nieuw Amsterdam becomes the city of New York and finally the first capital of the United States of America. This absorbing multi-generational saga continues through the Revolutionary War providing detailed and accurate historical background as well as an extraordinary storyline and subplots. Patriot Nathan Hale, British Generals Clinton and Howe, and colonial General George Washington are some of the characters who interact with Ms. Swerling's fictional cast.<br />The history of the beginnings of medical science are absolutely fascinating. A number of medical interventions, all performed without the use of anesthesia, are vividly described, including tracheotomies, amputations, a radical mastectomy, and the removal of kidney stones.<br />As an added attraction the dust jacket is illustrated with a wonderful view of early Manhattan taken from a copper engraving. The inside end papers show beautiful aerial illustrations of the city in its early days.

Although &quot;The Blood Of Roses&quot; is a sequel to Marsha Canham's &quot;The Pride Of Lions,&quot; this novel can stand on its own. I would suggest reading the prequel first, however, as it is also an excellent book and details the beginnings of Scotland's Jacobite uprising along with relating the story of how the principle characters meet.<br />English Lady Catherine Ashbrooke Cameron and her beloved Scottish husband, Alexander Cameron, the &quot;Camshroinaich Dubh,&quot; (Black Cameron), met and married in the whirlwind novel &quot;The Pride Of Lions.&quot; Now, with a price on his head, wanted by the English and his many enemies, and the target of at least one paid assassin, Alexander takes Catherine to his home in the Highlands while he and his clan plan to wage war on the English and place Prince Charles Edward Stuart, (Bonnie Prince Charlie), on the thrones of Scotland and England.<br />The story of the rebellion is meticulously researched, as are the conflicts between the clans, the Prince and his general. This is an extraordinary period in history and a tragic one. There is plenty of romance here - between the once spoiled young English noblewoman and Alexander Cameron, the man she gives up her wealth and home for. A second intense and passionate romance comes into play also between Catherine's lady's maid Deidre and Alexander's best friend, Aluinn MacKail.<br />As usual, Ms. Canham writes with style and captures the 18th century time period, the strife, battles and the intensity of the relationships with realism and passion. Her characters are three dimensional and seem to leap right off the page. It is also difficult not to feel terrible sorrow for the doomed Scots with the foreknowledge of the Battle of Culloden Moor and its horrific aftermath.

Beautiful and spoiled, young noblewoman Catherine Ashbrooke flirted with a handsome stranger at a ball to make her primary suitor, Lieutenant Hamilton Garner, jealous. Little did she know just how much the fire she was playing with would burn. The flirtation turned into a duel and she was forced to marry the winner, Raefer Montgomery, a wealthy English merchant. Furious at the outcome of her escapade, Catherine, a most unwilling bride, learned that her husband was not the man she believed him to be. He is, in fact, Alexander Cameron, the &quot;Camshroinaich Dubh,&quot; (Black Cameron), a Scottish Jacobite, a spy, and wanted by the English and his many enemies. With promises to set her free, Cameron takes Catherine back to Scotland to his family home, Achnacarry, in the Scottish Highlands. Here, against the backdrop of the Jacobite rebellion, the couple, who began as enemies, actually falls in love.<br />The English are not the only ones who would like to have Alexander Cameron's head on a platter. The Campbell clan has sought to kill him for over a decade. Ms. Canham describes the fascinating clan rivalry, clan wars and the Scottish lust for vengeance that can continue on for centuries. Years before, three Campbell sons attacked, raped and murdered Alexander's young bride. In revenge he slew all three and was forced into exile in France. Now that he is back in Scotland the Campbells know that his weakest link is his new bride. And the adventure that began with a forced marriage, intensifies, taking many surprising twists and turns before it concludes.<br />As usual, Ms. Canham writes with style and captures the 18th century time period, the strife, battles and the intensity of the relationships with realism and passion. Her characters are three dimensional and seem to leap right off the page. Alexander Cameron is an extraordinary hero - dark, handsome and courageous, he is filled with the 'pride of lions' and a sense of honor that would put most men to shame. Catherine is blonde, beautiful and the exact opposite of the type of woman that Alexander would normally choose. However, she is also a complex, intelligent person and she grows and changes as she learns more about her husband and his cause. The secondary characters are wonderful also, including Aluinn MacKail, Cameron's best friend, Deidre, Catherine's lady's maid, many members of Clan Cameron, as well as a few vile villains.<br />This is a wonderful historical novel about a tragic period in Scottish history.

It amazes me that Ms. Gabaldon has been able to continue to delight readers with her consistently good writing, excellent plots, superb characters and meticulous historic research for thousands of pages and four novels. &quot;Drums Of Autumn&quot; most certainly will not disappoint fans of the series. If you have not read the three preceding novels, I strongly urge you to do so before beginning this book. &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; may be able to stand as a novel in its own right, but I think it would be too confusing to enjoy it thoroughly without having read the historic and personal drama that Ms. Gabaldon details so well in her previous books. To label the &quot;Outlander&quot; series as merely historical romance fiction would be to do it a terrible injustice. This is an epic historical romance, yes...and so much more. The relationship between Claire and Jamie is one of the most caring and intimate I have ever encountered - in fiction or real life.  This is a couple who are solidly committed to a life together for better or worse. Theirs is a love that truly transcends the boundaries of time.<br />More than twenty years before this novel begins, Claire Beauchamps Randall, vacationing in post WWII Scotland, stepped through the ancient stone circle known as Craigh na Dun - and was suddenly sucked back in time to 1743 and war-torn Scotland. It was here that she met and married her own true love, highlander James Fraser. Before the tragic battle of Culloden Moor she was forced to return to the 20th century to protect herself and her unborn daughter, abandoning Jamie in the process. Two decades later Claire made the journey back through the stones to reunite with James in the 18th century, leaving their grown daughter, Brianna, behind.<br />James and Claire both agreed that there was no possibility to build a life for themselves in Scotland. The clans had been forced to disband, the people were starving and living in abject poverty, most of the men were dead, crippled, imprisoned and or jobless as a result of the doomed Jacobite uprising. The Frasers along with a few friends and James' nephew, Ian, cross the Atlantic and make their way to North Carolina where Jamie's aunt has a plantation. At the same parallel time, 20th century Brianna and her beloved Scottish boyfriend Roger discover some terrifying information about Claire's and Jamie's fate. Brianna is determined to reach her parents somehow and warn them of coming events, hoping to change the future. The inevitability of these events and the frustration and inability to change the future continue to be strong themes.<br />This is a phenomenal novel! Ms. Gabaldon details frontier life in beautiful 18th century North Carolina so clearly and accurately that one literally feels swept back in time. Claire and James have grown tremendously as characters, as have the love and intimacy between them. I have never experienced a couple as unique as these two in modern fiction. New characters are introduced, as well as a marvelously vile villain, and in typical Gabaldon style, these new folks are portrayed with realism, complexity and humor as are many of the old favorites. This is also Brianna's story. She finally meets her father in &quot;Drums Of Autumn&quot; and becomes a woman with a woman's responsibilities.<br />The books in this series are among my favorites novels, not just because the plots are so fascinating that I am unable to stop reading once I begin...although this is true. The characters are so palpably real that the reader actually bonds with them, at least with Jamie and Claire, in a way that is most unusual and very moving. We follow their lives and observe them as they grow as human beings, experience joy, suffer, and just interact with each other on a day to day basis, as well as in the midst of high adventure. We watch as they make history and as history tears away at them. I cannot recommend this book and series highly enough.<br />JANAy tears away at them.

Book 3 Of The 'Outlander' Series	&quot;Voyager&quot; is the third book in Diana Gabaldon's extraordinary &quot;Outlander&quot; series. If you have not read the two preceding novels, I strongly urge you to do so before beginning this book. &quot;Voyager&quot; may be able to stand as a novel in its own right, but I think it would be too confusing to enjoy it thoroughly without having read the historic and personal drama that Ms. Gabaldon details so meticulously in her previous books.<br />Claire Beauchamps Randall/Fraser had been sent back, (or forward), to the 20th century by her beloved husband James Fraser just before the 18th century Battle of Culloden Moor. Since both Claire and Jamie knew in advance of the battle's terrible outcome and the horrific consequences for Scotland, they decided that for Claire's safety and for the life of their unborn child, it would be best for them to part. &quot;Voyager&quot; opens 20 years after a pregnant Claire stepped, for the second time, through the standing stones and back to the present. As the novel opens she is a practicing physician in Boston and her daughter Brianna is a young woman, the spitting image of her Scottish father. Brianna does not know about her mother's strange adventures with time travel and believes her father to be Claire's first husband, Frank - the man Claire returned to twenty years ago. Although Frank accepted Brianna as his own and loved her with all his heart, the marriage was not a happy one. Frank could never bring himself to believe Claire's story of the strange events that occurred when she went missing. And Claire had never been able to stop loving Jamie...or longing for him. Frank died recently in an automobile accident and Claire is finally determined to discover what did happen to James and his clan after Culloden. She has made up her mind that if there is a possibility to return to James, she will. She is torn however, between the possibility of reuniting with her love after so many lonely years and not wanting to leave her daughter alone. Claire is also concerned with Brianna's reaction to her story. Frank never believed Claire...will her daughter believe her?<br />&quot;Voyager&quot; is the account of what occurred in Scotland and with James Fraser after Culloden and during the years the couple was separated. It is also the incredible detective story of how Claire, Brianna and a friend piece together enough historical information to discover Jamie's whereabouts so that Claire can find him. The initial part of the novel dealing with Claire's return to 18th century Scotland and her reunion with James is riveting, as is the description of a doomed Scotland, steeped in post war poverty and starvation, her men dead, imprisoned, crippled and/or jobless. This is the weakest novel of the three, however. When James and Claire make the decision to leave Scotland the plot noticeably wobbles. Some of their adventures are not very believable and others just too coincidental...almost forced. Without the backbone of history to strengthen the plot, as it did with the Jacobite uprising, the novel does some strange meandering. This is not to say that &quot;Voyager&quot; is a bad book or that it makes for poor reading. I found myself engrossed as quickly here as I did with Ms. Gabaldon's previous works and, with an occasional pause, found myself reading just as avidly throughout.

Claire Randall is on a second honeymoon with her husband Frank after serving as a combat nurse in World War II. While on a trip to Scotland they visit an ancient stone circle known as Craigh na Dun. Claire touches one of the standing stones and is suddenly sucked back in time to war-torn Scotland in 1743. After almost being captured and raped by hostile British soldiers, she is rescued and taken by a band of Scottish outlaws. An &quot;out of the fire into the frying pan&quot; situation if there ever was one. The Scots are deeply suspicious of Claire's dress, speech and manner. Thinking her to be a British spy they decide to take her with them to their stronghold. She does win the men over, to some extent, when she uses her nursing skills to save the life of one of their comrades, James Fraser, a recent escapee from a British prison.<br />And so begins one of the most remarkable sagas in modern fiction. To label &quot;Outlander&quot; a romantic historical novel is to do it a terrible injustice. This is an epic romance, yes. And the relationship between Claire and Jamie is one of the most caring and intimate I have ever encountered - in fiction or in real life.  Claire, having lived in England during the bombings of WWII, and served as a nurse at the front, is a resourceful, strong woman. And Jamie is an educated, philosophic man with a sense of humor...who is also a warrior in a &quot;Braveheart&quot; kind of way! This is a couple who are truly committed to a life together for better or worse. And Since Claire's first husband Frank will not be born for another 200 years, she is not committing bigamy. And, yes, &quot;Outlander&quot; is a historical novel, covering a tumultuous period in Scotland, England and France when Prince Charles Edward Stuart is attempting to regain the throne. I have also read time travel novels before, and this is like no other. The sheer magnitude of material that Diana Gabaldon covers, from the intrigues of the Scottish clans and the politics of the Jacobites to the everyday life of survival in 18th century Scotland, is extraordinary. Her research is impeccable and she tells a tale like no other. This is the kind of book you will want to read slowly and to savor. Ms. Gabaldon knows how to draw the reader into the story with her deft prose, wonderful humor, unusual characters and awesome adventures. One of the main reasons that I love this book is because Ms. Gabaldon develops her characters, major and minor, so that they become almost real. It is difficult not to form strong attachments to them and to care what happens to them all.<br />I had read &quot;Outlander&quot; when it first came out in the 1991, was entranced by it then and stored it away with my box of &quot;keepers.&quot; I recently had the flu and was looking for a wonderful book to take my mind off of my aches and pains and decided to reread this novel. Once started I had to keep going and am now on the third book in the series.

I usually do not care for sequels, whether in novels or films. After reading Diana Gabaldon's wonderful book, &quot;Outlander,&quot; I was sure she could not come up with another book to match the first. I was wrong and &quot;Dragonfly In Amber&quot; is an exception to my rule and an exceptional book. Once you begin to read, you will find yourself absorbed immediately and probably forget the novel's length (900+ pages). In fact, you may find yourself wishing it were longer.<br />There are two major storylines here. One takes place in the 18th century. Claire Randall, who had traveled back in time from post WWII Scotland to a Scotland preparing for the restoration of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, (Bonnie Prince Charlie) to the throne, had married James Fraser and confided to him the truth of her time travels. She also told him of the coming disaster of the Battle of Culloden Moor, (1745), and its terrible aftermath for all of Scotland. Together they do everything in their power to halt the inevitable uprising, including move to Paris to become part of the Prince's entourage and perhaps effect a change in history through their relationship with the Jacobites living in France. The relationship developed between Claire and Jamie continues to grow in this book. Their intensely passionate love and close friendship is extremely moving. Although James is a very strong and competent person, Claire with her strength of character, independence, resourcefulness and nursing skills moves adeptly through another time period and is as indispensable to James as he is to her. We travel with both of them, from the Scottish highlands to the pomp of the French court, as they attempt to impact history and continue on together with a love that transcends the boundaries of time.<br />The second and parallel plot takes place in 1968. Culloden is 200 years in the past. James had sent Claire back to the future to keep her and their unborn child safe from Scotland's fate right before the doomed battle and, they both believed, Jamie's inevitable death during the fight. Claire still feels the bitterness of the intrigues, betrayals, murders, treason and violence that were so much a part of her life with James as they fought together to spare Scotland from its future. Twenty years have passed and Claire, now a doctor, and her daughter Brianna, travel to Scotland from Boston. Brianna does not know the truth about her mother's history, before her birth, nor who her real father is. Claire's 20th-century husband is now dead and she is determined to discover what happened to James, their family and friends. He was her soulmate and the only man she ever loved. If there is a chance at all to find her Jamie, or at least discover what happened to him, she is will do it.<br />Once again Ms. Gabaldon deftly portrays 18th century Scotland and France and immerses the reader in another time with her superb historical research and writing style. Her characters, major and minor, complex and simple, grow and develop as you read. Many of them are introduced in &quot;The Outlander,&quot; but some remarkable new figures emerge from this novel also. Many of them are bound to capture your heart.<br />I don't know if this book could stand alone without reading &quot;Outlander&quot; first. And since there is so much to gain by reading both books, and continuing on to number three, I don't know why anyone would wish to do so...unless this book is purchased without the knowledge of the prequel. Gabaldon's &quot;Outlander&quot; series is a major epic and this novel is one of the best in the series. It is jam-packed with adventure, accurate historic detail, romance, friendship, and more from a most unusual perspective.

Elaine Sciolino, now a senior writer in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, has probably more experience covering Iran than any other American journalist and has reported on events there for over two decades. As a former foreign correspondent for Newsweek Magazine, Ms. Sciolino was aboard the airplane that brought the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to Teheran in 1979. In fact, she knowingly risked her life on the trip as the plane was under threat of being shot down by the Iranian air force. The Shah's generals had devised a plan to shoot down the plane and presented the details to President Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor. The Carter administration wanted no part of it. She was present for the Iranian revolution, the American hostage crisis, the Iran-Iraq war and many other important events, including the riots of 1999. She writes, &quot;I never went to Iran for the night life. I went for a revolution, a war, and an embassy seizure. And I kept going back.&quot; Through Iranian colleagues, friends and political contacts, she has had much access to Iranian life on all levels, and her keen observations provide an accurate source of information on this complex society, its people and its politics. In &quot;Persian Mirrors&quot; she maps the cultural, political, and social history of Iran since its Islamic Revolution.<br />The book contains hard-news, but Sciolino's mission was to write &quot;a portrait of my own encounters with Iran, and with the Iranian people, in the hope it can illuminate whatever choices or predictions others make.&quot; The memoir is organized by topic. After the first introductory sections, Sciolino explores the roles of women in Iran, (a topic I found absolutely fascinating), the role of religion, the dark side of life under a repressive government, and many Iranians' hopes for a politically reformed future. She portrays the grim realities of everyday life in Iran and the creative ways many people have found to make life better for themselves and their families.<br />Ms. Sciolino takes the reader along with her to the bazaars, beauty salons, aerobics studios, courtrooms, universities, mosques, palaces, and even a wedding in this extraordinary country. She portrays a vital society too long overlooked. The country is a mass of contradictions, she writes. Iranians make a distinct separation between Persian culture, (and they are extremely proud of their rich heritage), and modern Iranian culture. From the pre-Islamic capitol at Persepolis to the synagogue where Queen Esther is said to be buried, we travel with the author. We learn that the clerics who recite sensual classic Persian romantic poetry insist that the poems refer to divine love. Many of the country's leaders and citizens want to move forward and press for change, while others want to return the country to a distant past. The principle quandary is how to achieve democracy in an Islamic country.<br /><br />Ms Sciolino's concise eyewitness prose kept me turning the pages. It is difficult to put this book down once started. Her description of the country and its people and her adventures there as a young reporter, and later as a mature professional, are vividly recounted. Her growth and gradual understanding provide a unique and honest viewpoint.<br />I lived in Iran for three years, a long time ago. I made wonderful friends and always felt very welcome in their homes. Iran is noted for its hospitality to guests. I have continued to maintain my interest in the country, culture and people. &quot;Persian Mirrors&quot; brought back many wonderful memories and helped me to understand the many changes that have taken place in Iran since I left. I recommend this book highly. It makes for fascinating reading, and you will learn much that is so relevant in today's world.<br />JANAor themselves and their families.<br />Ms. Sciolino takes the reader along with her to the bazaars, beauty salons, aerobics studios, courtrooms, universities, mosques, palaces, and even a wedding in this extraordinary country.

Penelope Williamson mixes romance and history in this novel set in Cornwall during the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. McCady Trelawny, the novel's dark brooding hero, is the latest Earl of Caerhays. He is seemingly destined to self destruct, as did all his ancestors, though strong drink, gambling and other vices. Unlike his relatives, McCady's vice is an obsession to invent the first steam locomotive to run on rails. He has recently returned to England from fighting at Waterloo and the former captain, who made it through the war, almost blows himself up during a failed experiment with a small steam engine. A teenage girl, a wild child of the Cornish coast, destined to become a beautiful lady, attempts to rescue him but he rebuffs her assistance. Jessalyn Letty, who insists that McCady call her Miss Letty, is not easily deterred, however. And she is absolutely fascinated with the Earl, who she believes is a kindred soul. She contrives to meet him at fairs, along the beach, and occasionally ventures into his &quot;laboratory,&quot; making a pest of herself. He, in turn, stops thinking of her as a child and begins to see her as the woman she will become.<br />Trelawny leaves Cornwall for a few years to serve in the military in the West Indies. When he returns, Jessalyn has turned into the lovely, sympathetic woman she promised to become, and is engaged to her childhood sweetheart, an acquaintance of Trelawny's. She loves this man, a wealthy banker, but only as a friend. Trelawny's reappearance on the scene convinces her that she must break her engagement.<br />&quot;Once In A Blue Moon&quot; takes some surprising twists and turns, with attempted murder, jealous rage, betrayal, sabotage, and a passionate love story, all set against the backdrop of getting that steam locomotive on the rails and running. I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It's an interesting light read. The steam  locomotive part is based on historical fact.

A Thrilling Read!	\\"The Mistress\\" is an apt title for this novel, even though it may be misleading for those who are looking for a romantic read. Philippe Tapon gives the reader a penetrating look at Paris during the Nazi occupation through the eyes of a doctor, Emile Bastien, and his mistress, Simone. Dr. Bastien, specializing in the treatment of stomach ailments, is an equal opportunity doctor, accepting both French and German patients, including those from both the Gestapo and the Resistance.<br />Bastien lives with Simone and his two children in Paris. His wife, Marie resides on her estate in the south of France, racing horses, tending her vineyards, and nursing her bitterness and rage at the husband who has betrayed her. Simone is Bastien's nurse, secretary, housekeeper and nanny, as well as his jaded lover. Their love petered out long ago. They live very well in the war deprived city and Simone continues to stay with the sometimes abusive doctor out of self preservation. Where else is she to go? Self-preservation is something that Simone excels at. She is privy to all her lover's secrets and when he makes a move, during the final days of the occupation, to revenge himself against the Nazis, she has her own alternate plan.<br />Tapon's novel is tautly written in elegant prose. He tells a tale of betrayal and revenge against the backdrop of paranoia and fear that is Paris in 1944. His small cast of characters are cunning and duplicitous. Everyone is out for themselves in this dog-eat-dog world that the Third Reich created. I found myself unable to put this gripping and original novel down. I recommend it highly.<br />JANA	2004-01-17

A teenage model is raped in the VIP room of an upscale South Beach nightclub in front of a cast of characters right out of a Fellini film. The three perpetrators are all prominent, high profile men. Dade County officials and Miami Beach's city manager do not want the case brought to trial because of potential bad publicity and its impact on tourism. The decision to try the case is up to Sam Hogan, head of Major Crimes for Dade County. Hogan's boss, the state attorney, is being considered for the US Vice Presidential slot in the upcoming national election and Hogan wants his job.<br />Many of the witnesses to the crime are \\"beautiful people,\\" involved in the fashion industry, as was Hogan's only son Matthew. Matthew was a model who was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident a year or so before this incident. Dina Hogan, Sam's wife, has never recovered from her son's death. The investigation and interaction with the people who her son knew so well, including Sam's ex-mistress, causes Dina to unravel and distance herself even more from her husband and their daughter. Then a major witness, and a close friend of Matthew's, is found murdered and a sequence of unsettling events begins.<br />Barbara Parker has written a complex suspense thriller with an intricate plot filled with unexpected twists and turns, chilling suspense and a real cliffhanger ending. I am fairly good at solving mysteries but this one had me stymied. The characters who populate the novel are what make this book so unique. I found myself absorbed with them and thought about them at times when not reading. They are very realistic, not at all contrived, and very human in their desires, ambitions, greed, grief and motivations. The glamour of the fashion industry and the lowdown on the Miami/South Beach drug/crime scene and court system are added pluses. The South Florida setting and legal system is well  researched and Ms. Parker certainly knows her way around the courtroom. I highly recommend this. It is a well-written book and an excellent read.<br />JANAis a well-written book and an excellent read.<BR>JANA	2004-01-16

Determined to discover the problem that caused the vehement promise to be exacted, Bedwyn discovers that Miss Morris and all her dependents are to be evicted from their home and reduced to penury unless she marries within the next four days. Her father had bequeathed the manor and land to her for the period of one year. If she had not married in that time, the estate would go to her brother.

As Bedwyn had never planned to marry, he would, of course, return to the army and the couple would never meet again. As fate would have it, the marriage turns out to be anything but convenient and their time together is prolonged with interesting consequences.<br />This is the first of a three book series about the Bedwyn family - Wulfric, Duke of Bewcastle, his brothers Aiden, Rannulf, and Alleyne and sisters Freyja and Morgan. This novel  about Aiden and Eve makes for a light and pleasant romantic read. There is nothing complex about the tale, no subplots or much tension between the characters, who are charming if predictable. Ms. Balogh writes in her usual warm, emotional style which enhances the somewhat over-used storyline. I enjoyed reading &quot;Slightly Married&quot; and do recommend it as long as potential buyers/readers realize that this is not one of Mary Balogh's best efforts.<br />JANA	2004-01-09

In fact she is not a beautiful woman at all, although many would call her handsome, with her prominent nose, dark brows, olive complexion, and mass of fair unruly hair. Her high spirits, independence and competitive ways are anything but ladylike. She was raised with her four older brothers, Wulfric, Duke of Bewcastle, Aiden, Rannulf, Alleyne and younger sister Morgan, and matched her male siblings in all their sporting activities. She was definitely not one to sit still and play the fragile female.<br />The story opens with Lady Freyja visiting friends in Bath. She has escaped the christening of her ex-fiance's son back home and is depressed by old memories of a time when they were betrothed. She hides her vulnerability behind a veneer of icy pride. In an outrageous encounter on her journey to Bath she meets Joshua Moore, Marquess of Hallsmere, when he barges into her bedroom at a local inn and begs her to hide him. The two meet again in Bath under extremely funny circumstances. This brash, adventurous young man is fleeing his aunt's matchmaking schemes and is much taken by the strongwilled Freyja. There is obvious chemistry between them. In a spontaneous moment the two decide to fake a betrothal - he to get away from his aunt's matrimonial plans, she to prove to the world that she need not remain a spinster. Obviously fate intervenes and the couple is unable to announce their break-up within the week as they originally planned.<br />This is the last book in the Bedwyn family trilogy. &quot;Slightly Scandalous,&quot; as with the first book &quot;Slightly Married,&quot; makes for a light and pleasant romantic read. The plot is not very original, although it is much more complex than the storyline in book one. I did like Josh as a hero. He appears quite cavalier at first, but then the depth of his character becomes obvious. I also enjoyed the scenes with their families at their different estates - Freyja's at Lindsey Hall and Josh's in Cornwall. The other characters are charming if predictable.

Mikels tells a whale of a tale about the joy of competition, the human dilemma and fantasy run amok.<br />Justin Chastain, nineteen year-old son of the parents from hell, finds himself an orphan when his estranged father pulls-off a double murder suicide. Justin's mother was one of the victims. Mike Wilson, Chastain's first cousin, retrieves the dazed adolescent after the funeral and takes him home to his wife and daughters. Justin is shy, introverted and lacks confidence, but is a really good kid, especially considering his background. The Wilsons hope to give the boy a new lease on life and the opportunity to go to college.<br />Mike Wilson seemingly has everything a man could want - a beautiful, loving wife, two bright, healthy daughters, a good job and a lovely home. He is not a happy man, however. He obsessively relives his fifteen minutes of fame, long ago in high school, when he played a significant part in winning the final football game of the season. Wilson was a fierce competitor but unfortunately lacked the physical attributes to become a good athlete. He was admired by all, especially his former coaches, for his drive and commitment to the game. His greatest fantasy has always been to have the body and stamina to match his brain, drive and knowledge of football...and to have another chance in life to be a great athlete. I am reminded here of the old adage: &quot;Be careful what you wish for, it might come true.&quot;<br />Fate brings Justin and Mike together. Intense longing, natural phenomena and powerful chemistry combine to play havoc with their destiny.<br />This is a tightly written, compelling novel by an extremely talented writer. The characters are so realistic they just about jump off the page. I know as much about football as I do about rocket science and I have never been motivated to learn more about the game. But this story has universal appeal and has much more to do with the human spirit than with a spectator sport. If you happen to enjoy football - than that's a plus and will add to your enjoyment. I could not put this book down once I began reading and did learn a lot, in spite of myself. Highly recommended!<br />JANActator sport.

Filled with swashbuckling adventure, sweeping pageantry and the story of a passionate romance, Marsha Canham outdoes herself with this superb historical novel. \\"The Last Arrow\\" is the final book in a trilogy which began with Ms. Canham's \\"Through A Dark Mist,\\" followed by \\"In The Shadow Of Midnight.\\" It is not necessary to read the first two books, however, in order to thoroughly enjoy this one. The author gives a wonderful summary of her previous two novels here, and this book certainly stands on its own very well. I have read many series novels and rarely does an author succeed in continuously creating fresh ideas and storylines throughout. One of Ms. Canham's major achievements with this trilogy is that her plots are always original, never repetitious or contrived, and her characters continue to grow and acquire depth as the years, and pages, pass. The backdrop for this adventure-filled romance is medieval England, Wales, Normandy and Brittany during the reign of King John \\"Lackland.\\"<br />Lady Brenna Wardieu, daughter of Lord Lucien Wardieu, Baron de Gournay, (called the Black Wolf), is the book's heroine. Lovely, but not ladylike, Brenna has tagged after her warrior brothers since she could crawl. With much tutoring and practice she has become a master of the longbow, rivaling the best archers in the land. Feisty, with the heart of a noble knight in her woman's breast, she meets her match in Griffyn Renaud de Verdel, a mysterious mercenary who unknowingly trespasses on her father's land. Taken aback by her skill with the bow and arrow, Griffyn could have still overpowered Brenna. He allows her, instead, to capture him and bring him to face her family. She discovers that Griffyn and her brother Robin have already met. The two men jousted in the past at a tourney. Griffyn lost - the only loss he had sustained in many years. The consequences were tragic. He is intent on a rematch at the great upcoming tournament in Chateau Gaillard, Normandy.<br />This wonderful adventure begins long before the treachery at the French tournament. There are fascinating plots and subplots, filled with meticulously researched historical detail and peopled with extraordinary characters. England's troubled times and her evil king are woven into the story with great skill, as is a unique version of the Robin Hood tale. Political intrigue, hatred, revenge and fated love abound. Family sins and throne-rocking secrets are exposed. Royal power is unleashed. Some pretty unsavory, depraved characters murder, maim and threaten. Love and passion sizzle. Armored knights ride to battle and a royal princess is rescued. This novel has it all - from cliff-hanging escapades to steamy sensuality. The action doesn't stop until the last sentence on the last page.<br />As usual Ms. Canham writes with elegance and flair. Her characters are lifelike, varied and, occasionally, quite humorous.

The backdrop for this adventure-filled romance is medieval England, Wales and Brittany under the reign of King John<br />&quot;Lackland.&quot;<br />Eduard FitzRandulf, illegitimate son of Lord Lucien Wardieu, Baron de Gournay, (called the Black Wolf), is renowned in his own right as a skilled and noble knight. He is also the champion of the lovely Pearl of Brittany, Princess Eleanor Plantagenet, daughter of the deceased Duke Geoffrey of Brittany, son of Henry II and brother of King John. Princess Eleanor's brother Arthur was heir to the English throne after the death of King Richard the Lionhearted. John usurped the crown, and when Arthur sought to retake it, John had him imprisoned and killed - rumor had it by John's own hand. Eleanor was now the true heir and John's prisoner.<br />As the story begins, William, Marshal of England is visiting his old friend Lucien Wardieu at his home, the Chateau D'Amboise in Tourane. The reason for the visit is to inform Wardieu and his warrior sons that John of England, through nefarious schemes, intrigue, robbery and murder is bankrupting the country. The Marshal also wants Princess Eleanor to be rescued and knows the best man to perform the task is Eduard. While this political reunion is taking place, William's niece, the beautiful and willful Ariel de Clare turns up with her brother and two friends/escorts. King John had sought to marry the young woman off to an unworthy suitor for his own profit, while her uncle was away. She crossed the English Channel to France seeking help and winds up accompanying Eduard to England as part of the plan to aid the princess. Needless to say sparks fly between Ariel and Eduard from the moment they set eyes on each other.

She motors along Scotland's A9 and looks for male hitchhikers - buff, hunky males, the bigger the better. If a man meets her standards, she takes them on the ride of their lives...destination unknown. Isserley is tiny, though well developed where it counts. She is shy, introverted and scarred - inside and out.<br />&quot;Under The Skin&quot; is a chilling, bizarre, and erotically charged novel that explores how we view humanity, other races and species. Michel Faber almost forces the reader to observe how we, as human beings and caretakers of the earth, protect our environment and each other. This psychological thriller is at times macabre and gruesome, occasionally humorous with its satirical take on mankind, and often very sad. It is difficult not to empathize with Isserley's moral dilemma, yet how can we not condemn her? It is impossible to judge and we are not asked to here.<br />Mr. Faber's demonstrates his seemingly boundless imagination with this, his debut novel. If you allow him, he will take you to places you've never been to before in the world of fiction. Faber's plot and characters are some of the most original I have encountered in a long time. He weaves his compelling tale with a tightly written, elegant narrative and superb dialogue. He also created a language for the book that reminds me of the &quot;Nadsat&quot; language in &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Faber's &quot;The Crimson Petal And The White&quot; and, wanting to read more by the author, picked up &quot;Under The Skin.&quot; The two novels are as unalike as two works of fiction can be, although both are clearly written by the same extremely talented author. If you are looking for a totally unique reading experience, this is it! I doubt very much that you will be disappointed.<br />JANA	2003-12-28

A friend stopped by to visit a few days ago and forgot to take the book she was reading, (\\"The Night Before\\"), with her when she left. Thinking it looked like an interesting psychological thriller, I picked the novel up and started to read. After 3 chapters I realized why my friend left the book. She didn't like it. I struggled through another hundred pages, trying to find something redeemable in the plot, and finally gave up. This is one of the most boring, banal, poorly written books I have almost read in a long time. I rarely put a book down without finishing it - but this definitely deserved to be the exception to the rule.<br />Most of the characters seem to be on the verge of insanity - no kidding! Caitlyn Montgomery Bandeaux, the story's heroine, and her entire large, wealthy and prominent family, are all candidates for a mental institution or a psychiatrist's couch, as are many of the novel's peripheral characters - the detectives and the first murder victim, (while he lived), included. The author writes that the Montgomery family has \\"bad blood,\\" but what about the rest of the town?? Many of the other characters are obviously below average in intelligence and not particularly likable. Lisa Jackson's storyline is choppy and not terribly exciting. The dialogue is extremely repetitious. I won't go into a plot description because others have done that already and there is not much to summarize beyond that.<br />I do not enjoy writing reviews for bad books, nor do I like reading them. I wrote this to save you the trouble. I am sure Ms. Jackson has written better.<br />JANA	2003-12-27

Last year a friend served the best carrot cake I have ever eaten. I asked for the recipe and she brought out this cookbook. The carrot cake I so admired had been made from a mix.

There's also an extraordinary recipe for orange cream cheese frosting included.<br /><br />The same friend bought me this book for my birthday and I have been using it ever since. I frequently turn to it, especially when entertaining and during holidays. I have baked the Deeply Chocolate Almond Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting (outrageous - but if you don't like the taste of almonds, or prefer your chocolate without - there are many other wonderful chocolate cake recipes), the Orange Dreamsicle Cake, Pecan Pie Cake, the Banana Cake with Quick Caramel Frosting and, of course, the carrot cake.<br /><br />The book contains more than 175 recipes for cakes, dessert bars, crisps, cobblers, tira misu, frostings, etc. There are beautiful color photographs of each dessert and chapters on how to prepare and &quot;doctor&quot; the recipes for the best results. After tasting the results, you will not believe that all these creations begin with a boxed cake mix - and neither will your guests!<br /><br />This is THE book for anyone who loves to cook and does not have lots of time.

Kate Moses seems to have climbed into the very soul of Sylvia Plath and brought her vividly to life on the written page with her stunning novel \\"Wintering.\\" I read the novel in a 24 hour period, with a well worn copy of Plath's poetry by my side. Ms. Moses recreates the haunted last months of the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet. She researched her subject extensively and seemingly absorbed into her bloodstream all she read. Plath's skeleton is fleshed out from ink on page and recreated, with an artist's eye, into a vital woman determined to write her poems and raise her family alone. Moses' detail, language and imagery is exquisite and so reminiscent of her subject's that her prose reads like poetry.<br />The book begins at the conclusion of Plath's marriage to poet Ted Hughes. Throughout their tempestuous six years together they shared an extraordinary and mutually productive literary life. They were each other's best critics, and inspired and encouraged the other in their writing careers. The couple had two children, Frieda and Nicholas, still in their infancy when plans for a divorce were made. Their idyllic life together in the English countryside had descended into drama, violence and finally disaster. Hughes left his wife for another woman, a mutual friend, and Plath, in terrible anguish, is left to begin a new life for herself and her babies in a London flat, once occupied by William Butler Yeats.<br />\\"Wintering\\" is set in London in December 1962, with flashbacks to the couple's earlier years. Each of the forty-one chapters takes its title and substance from one of the \\"Ariel\\" poems, written during the last four months of the poets life. In spite of the quantity of poetry she pours onto the page, Plath is plagued with reoccurring bouts of clinical depression which she fights desperately. It was bitter cold in London that winter, she and her children were sick with the flu, without a telephone and friends. Having betrayed their marriage Hughes has retreated and is relatively unavailable to call on for help. As Sylvia, weakened with fever, is unable to sleep, her tumultuous mind on fire, she writes her poetry through the night. Dark moods and despair threaten to overcome her in her fragile physical and emotional state. She is left to the mercy of the demons which have pursued her since her breakdown, attempted suicide and hospitalization ten years earlier.<br />This book is almost as much about language as it is about the last winter Sylvia Plath spends on earth. But then, so much of Ms. Plath's being was about language. To separate the two would have been an injustice. The author succeeds admirably in doing justice to the poet's work and style. \\"Wintering\\" is also about pain - palpable, terrible pain.<br />It is important to note that Kate Moses does not include the suicide in her novel. This is a story of a struggle for life, independence, art and for family. And Plath fought with all the vitality and energy she possessed. Sylvia Plath was a brilliant and prolific poet, a wonderful mother, and she died too young, at age 30. Kate Moses' novel is a near masterpiece. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br />JANAis relatively unavailable to call on for help.

Diane Middlebrook's book about the ill-fated marriage of poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes is an extraordinary combination of biography and literary criticism. Rather than focusing on Plath's depression and subsequent suicide, the author offers a valuable, unsentimental analysis of both their work and the influence they had on each other's lives and creative processes.<br />She portrays Hughes, not as an egotistical, philandering husband who abandoned his wife and family, but as a man and a poet, struggling with his failed marriage. In fact, how marriages fail, and the men and women who fail in making their relationships work, are part of the book's central theme. Hughes' inspired and encouraged his wife's creativity, but he also contributed to the anguish which led to her suicide. Living with Sylvia Plath was not an easy task though. Her work, her life and her death profoundly changed Ted Hughes' perspective on his own life and work.<br /><br />Plath, more than thirty years after her death, has evolved into an icon of martyred feminism and is revered by her passionate following. Many believe that her tragic suicide was a result of the overwhelming societal demands placed on a woman/wife/mother/artist at the midpoint of the last century. However, Sylvia Plath is, foremost, one of the most brilliant poets of that century, with her roles as daughter, wife and mother taking second place to her art. Her death was a tragedy, not a personal statement or rebellion. Her history of mental illness, and the barbaric treatment she received for the disease, is a known fact. Her pain was a violent presence in her life, especially during the last months. There was nothing passive, quiet or calculating about it. Plath was a victim of her demons, perhaps the Furies, who finally claimed her.<br /><br />During his lifetime Hughes was very reluctant to disclose information about his turbulent relationship with his poet wife, especially about their break-up and her months alone with her two children during a terrible London winter. He explained his silence as wanting to protect his children. Finally, in 1998, &quot;Birthday Letters&quot; was published, a volume of verse-letters about his relationship with his wife. Weeks after publication Hughes died. In this volume, Hughes breaks his silence and responds to critics, scholars, and in a sense to Sylvia. This material provided literary scholars with the perspective they had lacked for so long. Hughes, at last, describes his struggle to love and live with a beautiful, talented woman suffering from serious clinical depression. Middlebrook draws heavily on the book, as well as Hughes' papers at Emory University, Sylvia Plath's journals and papers at Smith College, and an abundance of written material heretofore unavailable.<br />Ms. Middlebrook also analyzes the profound effect both poets had on each other's work. She writes, &quot;One of the most mutually productive literary marriages of the 20th century lasted only about 2300 days. But until they uncoupled their lives in October 1962, each witnessed the creation of everything the other wrote, and engaged the other's work at the level of its artistic purposes. They recognized the ingenuity of solutions to artistic problems that they both understood very well.&quot; Hughes believed that he and Plath had similar dispositions and often felt as if he was drawing on a &quot;single shared mind.&quot; They shared tastes in literature, authors and poets. They sketched together, wrote together and were physically a passionate, well-matched pair. The author documents the descent of their happiness to drama and despair, while showing the effect of these emotions on their work.<br />Diane Middlebrook's insightful, literate, well-crafted biography must have been difficult to write. The amount of grief and pain contained in the literary work she researched and the lives she wrote about boggles the mind - and hurts the heart. She is a partisan of poetry - not of TedHughes nor of Sylvia Plath. She remains as objective as possible when drawing her conclusions. And most importantly, her focus is on the impact that Sylvia Plath's life and death had on her husband and his writing, allowing Plath's legacy to live on posthumously.<br />JANAhes nor of Sylvia Plath.

Author Gita Mehta demonstrates her extraordinary grasp of the historical, political and cultural complexities of India, British and royal, under the Raj. She writes with realistic detail and subtlety about the period from Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee to the violent and bloody civil wars for independence. Ms Mehta brings her characters, both fictional and real, to life. She gives the reader a firsthand view of a maharajah's royal zenana, (harem), where women in purdah are guarded by corrupt eunuchs and she takes us to the battlefields of WWI along with Indian Calvary warriors. We witness Mahatma Gandhi march to the sea, with hundreds of thousands of his countrymen, to break British laws against making salt. And we witness, most vividly, India's struggle for independence and partition - from nationalist, royalist and British points of view. Gita Mehta brilliantly translates the cultural nuances and vividly sets her scenes of pageantry and poverty.<br />At the center of this epic novel is Jaya Singh, the only daughter of the Maharajah and Maharani of Balmer. She was raised in the thousand year-old tradition of purdah by her mother and was educated exactly like her royal brother, (Balmer's heir), according to her father's decision. She learned to play polo, hunt tiger and wild boar, and how to govern and lead. Jaya marries the jaded, westernized Maharajah of Sipur and finds herself in a history-making position.<br />I have always been fascinated by India, especially during the period of the British Raj. Usually, however, the focus of the books I have read has been on the Indian nationalist movements and those who supported and led them. This well researched novel also delves into the lives and politics of princely India. An engrossing read with a fresh perspective - I really enjoyed it.<br />JANA	2003-12-14

Sassy, sexy Cubana PI, Lupe Solano, firmly believes she should have been born a man. Lupe says she thinks like a man, acts like one and lives her life like one. She is, however, speaking about sexual politics and roles in the world she knows best - Miami's Little Havana, and her point of view is that of an upper-class Cuban-American woman. Although she may be very different from other women in her community, she is certainly all female - an independent and feisty one. Carolina Garcia-Aguilera brings her protagonist and supporting cast to life with much wit and an insider's cultural and political take on the Miami community. Lupe is one of the most interesting women private investigators around today - earthy but sophisticated, packs a pistol and paints her nails - a gumshoe who wears Manolo Blahnicks.<br />Lupe and her \\"latest love interest\\" attend her niece Marianna's wedding to a very wealthy scion of the old Cuban aristocracy, where she is approached by the groom's Aunt Lucia. A family heirloom, a lost tapestry given to an ancestor by Christopher Columbus in 1502, is hidden in Havana and the family has been unable to retrieve it for 40+ years. Very few people know that the antique masterpiece exists. Lucia wants to hire our gal PI to travel to Cuba and bring it back. Before Lupe can even pack her suitcase, a shady business acquaintance turns up dead - strangled with a pair of pantyhose. Then a second murder occurs and Lupe begins to suspect that the killings and her quest for the priceless tapestry could be connected.<br />\\"Havana Heat\\" is an enthralling mystery filled with international intrigue, suspense, murder, details of the Cuban art world, and an insider's close-up portrait of a little-known community. Ms. Garcia-Aguilera writes from experience as she was born in Cuba, raised in Little Havana and worked as a licensed PI in Miami for over ten years. Her research is impeccable and her humor adds much to the narrative. I thoroughly enjoyed this one!<br />JANA	2003-12-14

Master spy novelist Len Deighton has created a chilling history of Germany from 1900 through 1945, told through the characters of an upper middle-class German family - the Winters. Deighton, with his knowledge of Germany and the German people, along with his meticulous research, brings his characters and history alive in \\"Winter: A Berlin Family.\\"<br />Veronica Rensselaer Winter, a wealthy American heiress married to a patriotic and ambitious German, Harald Winter, gives birth to her second son Paul in Vienna in 1900. Paul and his older brother Peter are the novel's central characters in this complex family drama that gives chilling insight into the \\"normal,\\" everyday men and women who made the horrors of Nazi Germany possible. Deighton creates an excellent backdrop for pre-World War I Germany, with the brothers' wonderful boyhood in Berlin. They suffer all the horrors of fighting in the Great War and both change considerably as a result. The war's aftermath brings political anarchy to the country, where money is so inflated it is worthless and jobs are almost nonexistent. Although poverty scarcely effects the wealthy Winter family, they are very aware of their fatherland's turmoil. Communists and Nazis battle for power and more people turn to Hitler as the answer to Germany's recovery from its humiliating defeat. Deighton paints a sinister picture of the rise of Nazism and WWII, as well as the Final Solution for the Jewish population of Europe. People like Pauli Winter, who becomes the quintessential Nazi bureaucrat, is portrayed superficially as a \\"nice Nazi.\\" Underneath, he is just the type of murderer who helped make the deaths of countless millions possible. His brother Peter takes an entirely different route, but never fails in his loyalty and love for his younger brother.<br />This book is unusual for a novel about Nazi Germany. The author has created realistic characters and developed them well. The horrors of the Great War's effect on the German people are demonstrated clearly enough that it becomes obvious, if not acceptable, why they turned toward Hitler for relief and change. It is easy to care for both brothers, their family and friends, so that when Deighton's characters change their morality, for the sake of political expediency, some readers may justify (temporarily) their actions and many others will loathe those who went with the flow - or directed it. This novel is much more than a family history - it is a well-written and amazingly accurate history of Germany during the first half of the 20th century. Highly recommended!<br />JANAdemonstrated clearly enough that it becomes obvious, if not acceptable, why they turned toward Hitler for relief and change.

Sackville, a very powerful and vain man, is extremely sensitive about his &quot;performance problems.&quot; When he found Mira, destitute, after recently arriving from France, he offered his protection in exchange for her pretense. Mira also wants to hide her past. She is French, well educated, very polished and quite a beautiful young woman. But she does not want anyone to know where she comes from.<br />She and Alex are inevitably drawn to each other. He is driven to learn Mira's secrets, not only about her relationship with Sackville but also about her years in France and her childhood.<br />This is a wonderful romance, filled with intrigue and action.

He takes the reader, chronologically, from the period of the first known references to the Israelites outside the Bible, (1220 B.C.E.), an Egyptian inscription commemorating the victory of the pharaoh Marniptah over the wandering tribe, to the declaration of Israeli statehood in 1948, and further still to the present peace negotiations in the Middle East. This sweeping and highly informative work presents the major geographical, cultural and political forces that have determined the course of Jewish history. Scheindlin also discusses the many individuals, secular and religious, who have shaped the mindset and character of the Jewish people.<br />I am taking a course in Jewish history and asked my professor for \\"an excellent but readable book\\" on the subject.

Her father is the 2nd son of an earl who was disowned by his family when he left the Church of England and married a governess.<br />During a brawl on the London docks, started by one of Rev. Woodbridge's sermons, Joss is saved from being trampled by Alexander Blackthorne, a newcomer to England. Alex, the American son of an English noblewoman and her Muskogee Indian husband, has been sent to live with his mother's people to reform his rowdy ways and become a gentleman. Alex is immediately drawn to Joss' intelligence, wit and unconventionality. She is smitten at first glance by his tall good looks and kindness. A fast friendship forms between the two. However, Joss accepts her plain, gawky appearance and understands that Alex can never love her as a woman - especially as he has most of London's females, society ladies and Cyprians, at his feet. The two seem to continuously get into humorous and dangerous scrapes from which they rescue each other, until Joss finds herself in a terrible predicament that may be impossible to escape. True to form, Alex comes to the rescue with a most unusual proposal. And the excitement, steamy and otherwise, really begins.<br />Shirl Henke has written a delightful romance, one of her best.

Michel Faber's colossal novel, \\"The Crimson Petal And The White,\\" is of Dickensonian scope and setting, but it delves deeper and more graphically into the down and dirty life of Victorian England than Mr. Dicken's did - thanks to 21st century sensibilities. There is bawdiness galore here, and local color from lowest-brow brothels and pubs to highbrow clubs and ballrooms. The very original cast of characters who accompany the reader through the doors of these places are as varied in class as they are in morality. This epic is chock-full of sizzling sex, prostitution of all variety, horrific poverty, disease and filth, and the epitome of wealth, privilege and luxury.<br /><br />The reader is escorted through the novel, and through London's streets, by a delightful, but always anonymous, narrator - who occasionally reminds us that we are reading a novel. We are taken to meet various people who soon sweep us into the pageant of their lives. One of the most memorable characters is Miss Sugar, patronym unknown. Sugar is a nineteen year old prostitute who has made a name for herself, not only by word of mouth but through the gentlemen's' guide \\"More Sprees in London - Hints for Men About Town.\\" Sugar is lauded in the publication as undertaking, with zeal, any means and methods to pleasure her clients. She works for her wretched mother, the Madame and owner of Mrs. Castaway's House of Prostitution, and has since her 13th year. Sugar, smart and literate, is utilizing these unappreciated talents to write a dark novel of revenge, at various times entitled: \\"Scenes From The Streets,\\" \\"A Cry From The Streets,\\" \\"An Angry Cry From An Unmarked Grave,\\" \\"Women Against Men,\\" \\"Death In The House Of Ill Repute,\\" \\"Come Kiss The Mouth Of Hell,\\" \\"The Fall And Rise Of Sugar,\\" etc. - you get the gist. One evening she meets a client who will forever change her destiny.  William Rackham, a wealthy perfume magnate, with a noble wife, has been down and out on his luck. He desperately needs some cheering-up. Fortunately he is a subscriber to \\"More Sprees In London\\" which leads him to Sugar's open arms. He tells her he longs to be debased and she is eager to serve his every whim. Temporarily, at least, this is a match made in heaven. Both Sugar's and Rackham's stars rise in each other's company. And along the way, we are witness to the rising and falling fortunes of their various friends and family members.<br />Faber paints a vivid portrait of Victorian England. He details the period costumes, manners, food, life on the street and in the drawing room, upstairs and down, the King's English and street cant, the opera and music hall, without slowing the brisk pace of his narrative. The title, \\"The Crimson Petal And The White,\\" implies the distinction between virtue and immorality. The author has an unusual take on just who his heroes and heroines are.

Graham Greene wrote one of the best novels of the 20th century with &quot;The Quiet American.&quot; His straightforward, elegant prose along with ample doses of irony and humor, make this novel a masterpiece. Greene's characters are extraordinarily complex and passionate beneath their seemingly quiet exteriors. Published in 1955, during the waning days of French colonialism and the beginning of American intervention in Southeast Asia, the book foreshadowed the America War in Vietnam.<br /><br />Thomas Fowler, Greene's narrator, is a cynical, veteran journalist for a London newspaper based in Saigon in 1952. The dispassionate Fowler has &quot;gone native.&quot; He has fallen in love with Vietnam and with the lovely Phoung, a one-time taxi dancer who is young enough to be his daughter. Despite the turbulent political climate, Fowler is content with filing an occasional story and living a pleasurable, carefree life. His dream is to convince his Catholic wife, back in England, to divorce him so he can live out his days idyllically with Phoung and an opium pipe in Saigon.<br /><br />Enter Alden Pyle, a seemingly innocuous, naive American who is supposedly part of a medical assistance delegation sent by the US government. Pyle is a passionate advocate of an American foreign policy theorist named York Harding, who has proposed that the solution to the problems in French Indochina is a &quot;third force,&quot; other than the French colonial government and the Vietminh insurgents currently battling for control of the country. Pyle has really come to Vietnam to foster this alternative third player - a Vietnamese strongman who would lead an American-backed government.<br /><br />Fowler and Pyle meet and improbably, the jaded, world weary Brit and the earnest, patriotic American form a friendship - until Pyle intrudes in the relationship between Fowler and Phoung. Pyle falls in love with Phuong, almost at first sight. He seduces her away from Fowler with promises of marriage and a life in America. Initially, Pyle's innocence and decency were endearing to Fowler. However, with the potential loss of his lover and the increasing evidence that Pyle is involved in violent clandestine activities, Fowler's feelings toward Pyle begin to sour and the friendship becomes strained. Still Fowler strives to remain objective about the political situation and proclaims, &quot;I don't get involved. I just report what I see&quot;.<br /><br />After a car bomb in downtown Saigon kills several innocent bystanders, Fowler traces the contents of the bomb back to Pyle. He realizes that Pyle, in his fervent adherence to ideological theories, has lost his humanity. He sees Pyle as the quintessential innocent and too simplistic: &quot;'...I had better look after Pyle.' That was my first instinct - to protect him. It never occurred to me that there was greater need to protect myself. Innocence always calls mutely for protection, when we would be so much wiser to guard ourselves against it. Innocence is like a dumb leper who has lost his bell, wandering the world meaning no harm.&quot; And finally, Fowler is dramatically forced to take sides. He can no longer be a passive observer to the growing conflict.<br /><br />Graham Greene quotes Lord Byron on one of the pages preceding the novel, &quot;This is the patent age of new inventions/ For killing bodies, and for saving souls,/ All propagated with the best intentions.&quot; This novel is at once a powerfully prophetic commentary and a riveting thriller.

Sloan has written a gripping psychological suspense thriller with \\"Guilt By Association.\\" Once I began this novel, I found it almost impossible to put it down. Her journalistic writing and realistic characters give the illusion, at times, that this is a nonfiction account of a terrible crime and the aftermath.<br />Karen Kern, a lovely coed with a bright future, attends a friend's holiday party one evening in December, 1962. Later that evening another party guest offers to walk her home. Unable to get a taxi, she accepts the offer. Bob, a wealthy Harvard student from a good family, was properly introduced to her and her friends knew him. She felt comfortable accepting his company on the long walk across Central Park. Bob brutally rapes and beats Karen in the park, abandoning her in the frigid winter air where she is found unconscious the following morning. Karen almost died that night. Since there are no witnesses to the crime, the police convince her family that they could never win the case if they press charges. The young man's family is influential. He is a good student at a top school and has no prior history of violence. Karen's parent's are too ashamed to pursue justice and tell their friends that Karen was the victim of a hit and run accident. It takes her over a year, and many surgeries, to recover - although she is left with a limp, no spleen, a badly damaged psyche and no self confidence. She will never have the children she has always longed for. Her life is ruined. She does not return to school. Her fiance, whom she finally tells the truth to, is unable to deal with the horrific situation and leaves her. Karen is brutalized once again by social and legal biases.<br />Ms. Sloan writes two parallel storylines. She develops the lives and careers of Karen Kern, who has been forever altered by the attack, and Robert (Bob) Willmont, Karen's assailant, who is not effected by his actions at all. Sloan creates credible lives and fascinating characters for both of them. Tension and suspense build to a peak until the inevitable happens. The two, victim and assailant, meet thirty years later. What happens makes for some of the most riveting reading imaginable - and gives new meaning to the concept of \\"revenge.\\"<br />This book is more than a thriller, however. Ms. Sloan has written a chronicle of the changing attitudes towards women over a period of thirty years. I lived through those times and can testify to the accuracy of her writing. Karen is a courageous figure who tries, for over 3 decades, to come to terms with her ordeal.

A friend recommended it to me recently, and after reading it once I know I will keep it to read over and over again. Alain-Fournier has written, with heartbreaking poignance, about a magical period between boyhood and manhood; a time that once gone can never be recaptured. The book's title has shifted over the years from &quot;The Grand Meaulnes,&quot; to &quot;The Wanderer,&quot; and then &quot;The Lost Domain.&quot; Alain-Fournier writes about a boy who is called &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot; by his friends and fellow schoolmates. What does &quot;Grand&quot; mean? The novel's translator writes: &quot;No English adjective will convey all the shades of meaning that can be read into the simple word 'grand' which takes on overtones as the story progresses. 'Le Grand Meaulnes' can be 'the tall,' 'the big,' 'the almost-grown-up,' even 'the great Meaulnes' - or with schoolboys, even 'good old Meaulnes.' But when the book has been put down, that phrase evokes in retrospect the image of someone not only tall or big, but also daring, noble, tragic, fabulous.&quot; And Augustin Meaulnes is all those things - as he is also a wanderer, searching for a lost domain.<br />The tale is set in France in the late 1800s. Our narrator is Francois Seurel, the somewhat sheltered, adolescent son of Sainte-Agathe's secondary schoolmaster. A new border comes to the school, Augustin Meaulnes, bringing adventure and a breath of fresh air into Francois' peaceful, rather sedate life. The charismatic young man easily becomes the leader of the schoolboys and much admired by all.  He is definitely not flamboyant nor a show-off, but a rather quiet, serious and sometimes introspective young man. Yet he has tremendous imagination and leads the boys on childish exploits, &quot;bold and dangerous.&quot; One day Meaulnes disappears on what the others believe is a seemingly harmless prank - an adventure. When he returns, 3 days later, he is forever changed. He becomes reclusive and obsessively works on a map he is making. He loses interest in everything and everyone, except for Francois, who has become his only confident.<br />The day Meaulnes disappeared from the schoolhouse, he became lost and disoriented. After an anxious overnight stop, in the middle of nowhere, he found himself in the midst of a grand and fantastic celebration in a forest clearing. The festival was held to celebrate the wedding of young Frantz de Galais and his beloved bride. At this feast, Augustin Meaulnes met the beautiful, gentle, mysterious Yvonne, Frantz' sister. Tragically, the wedding never took place, the party was disbanded, and Meaulnes, forced to take leave immediately, lost sight of Yvonne - his fairy-princess, his love dream of adolescence.<br />He returned to Sainte-Agathe but remained haunted by memories of the magic place, its trappings and most of all, Yvonne. Meaulnes' time was now almost exclusively spent trying to find his way back, but since he didn't know how he arrived at the domain, he didn't know how to return. Disconsolate, he wrote down everything he remembered about his trip and began his mapmaking. He promised Francois that he could accompany him when he finally makes his way back to the lost domain. Together the two friends attempt to retrace Meaulnes' footsteps. They journey together into the world of adulthood, trying to close the circle between what had been and what was yet to be.<br />Alain-Fournier's descriptive prose is exquisite. His narrative frequently reads like pure poetry, filled with magical imagery. I must say a few words here about Frank Davison's superb and faithful translation. Without Mr. Davison's work, I would not have been able to appreciate Fournier's prose. This story of friendship and love, of vows broken and vows kept, is one of the most original and unique books I have ever read. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br />What makes this novel even more poignant is that theauthor was killed, at age 27, in the first actions of WWI. I was overwhelmed by sadness when I learned of this terrible loss. Alain-Fournier will always be remembered through his wonderful work.<br />JANAhe author was killed, at age 27, in the first actions of WWI.

John Le Carre's disillusioned, cynical and spellbinding spy novels are so unique because they are based on a wide knowledge of international espionage. Le Carre, (pen name for David John Moore Cornwell), acquired this knowledge firsthand during his years as an operations agent for the British M15. Kim Philby, the infamous defector, actually gave Le Carre's name to the Russians. The author's professional experience and his tremendous talent as a master storyteller and superb writer make &quot;The Spy Who Came In From The Cold&quot; one of the most brilliant novels I have read about spying and the Cold War. Graham Greene certainly agreed with me, or I with him, when he remarked that it is the best spy story he had ever read. The novel won Le Carr&eacute; the Somerset Maugham Award.<br />The novel's anti-hero, Alec Leamas, is the antithesis of the glamorous action-hero spy, James Bond. A successful espionage agent for the British during WWII, Leamus continued on with counter-intelligence operations after the war, finding it difficult to adjust to life in peacetime. He eventually became the head of Britain's Berlin Bureau at the height of the Cold War. Leamus, slowly going to seed, drinking too much, world weary, had been losing his German double agents, one by one, to East German Abteilung assassins. Finally, with the loss of his best spy, Karl Riemeck, Leamus has no agents left. His anguish at Riemeck's death is palpable. He has begun to tire of the whole spy game, as his boss at Cambridge Circus, (British Intelligence), seems to understand.<br />Leamus is called back to London, but instead of being eased out of operations, called &quot;coming in from the Cold,&quot; or retiring completely, he is asked to accept one last, dangerous assignment. &quot;Control,&quot; the man Leamus reports to, asks him if he is up to &quot;taking-out&quot; Hans Dieter Mundt, a top East German operations agent and the man responsible for the deaths of Leamus' agents. The ploy is elaborate, and if successful, it will conclude with Mundt's own men killing him. With much planning Leamus convincingly changes his lifestyle and sets himself up as bait as a potential defector to the Eastern Block countries. As Leamus works efficiently toward his goal, two unexpected problems come-up - problems that he is unaware of until much later, when it is almost too late to resolve them. First, he falls in love with a young woman, a member of the Communist Party, who was supposed to be part of his cover, nothing more. And second, Control and the Circus have embedded plots within plots to further their end, which they don't see fit to reveal to Leamus - now operating in the dark. Le Carre portrays spying as a dirty game of acting, betrayal, lying, excruciating tension, and assumed identities. The espionage methods of East and West are the same. The only difference is their economic ideologies. There is a seemingly endless game of chess between the superpowers, and spies are as expendable as pawns.<br />This is a short novel, 219 pages, and very tightly written. However there is much packed into this bleak tale of the espionage business. The story has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster. And the ride is well worth it!<br />JANAif successful, it will conclude with Mundt's own men killing him.

Kathy Hepinstall wrote this powerful novel of love, loss, sin and redemption with simple lyrical prose. Her language and story will haunt you long after you finish the book. Ms. Hepinstall has taken the idea of atonement and created a fresh and original novel in this sometimes disturbing parable of redemption and forgiveness.<br /><br />There was a small place tucked in the lush backwoods of Louisiana, not far from the Texas border, where women with a sorrow could go to seek refuge, tenderness, kindness, companionship, and even a waltz. A woman could talk about her pain there and a man would listen with his whole being, and perhaps hold her gently. This was \\"The House Of Gentle Men.\\" A secret place, safe from prying eyes. A place where haunted men, who had done violence and had caused hurt, could atone through giving gentle care to women who badly needed that commodity. There were plenty of men damaged by their pasts, and by the war. They now sought peace and were willing to work for it. They might touch the women when asked, they might kiss, hold, and dance, but no sexual intercourse was allowed in this place. The men denied themselves the fleeting pleasure of physical fulfillment in order to heal deeper wounds. And through the house's goings-on, souls could and did heal. This may sound a bit strange to the reader, and it is to the author's credit that she turns such a unique idea into a strong and plausible story. The owner of the House of Gentle Men, Leon Olen, built it in hopes that his wife, who abandoned him and their two children eight years before, would return someday if he atoned for his shortcomings...and if he helped others atone for theirs.<br /><br />Before the war many soldiers trained in this area of Louisiana. Charlotte, a sixteen year-old girl, fresh from the grief of her mother's tragic death, went into the woods with a young girl's dreams, hoping to leave some of her sadness behind. She was set upon by three rowdy soldiers and was violently raped. Charlotte stopped talking that day and remained silent for the next eight years. A baby began to grow inside her that day also. And nine months later, when her son was born, in that lonely wood, Charlotte abandoned him. She left the child on a tree stump where she hoped he would be found. Hours later, filled with remorse over her decision, she returned for her baby. He was gone. The war finally ended, but Charlotte's, and many other's war continued to rage on.<br /><br />A new man came to Mr. Olen's house. He didn't want to talk or to stay more than one night. And he didn't want to work with the women. He tried to hang himself there. He finally tells Mr. Olen his story. He is one of the three soldiers who raped Charlotte. Charlotte meets him at the house, and he recognizes her. A relationship, a bond, forms between the two. Love begins. He wants to tell her the truth but fears she will never forgive him. And can she forgive herself for abandoning her child? Ms. Hepinstall creates in Charlotte a woman whose character has been forged, through pain, into tremendous strength.<br />This wonderful novel is filled with extraordinarily original characters. There is humor here as well as dark secrets and terrible sadness. This is a beautifully written book that reads like poetry at times. I highly recommend it.

Judith McNaught is one of my favorite authors in the Romance genre and I waited a long time for this book to be published. I am disappointed. &quot;Someone To Watch Over Me&quot; is not a bad novel, but I am used to so much more from Ms. McNaught. Her principal characters are flat. She does not develop them well, and I had difficulty relating to them. The one character I did care about, Detective Samantha Littleton, plays a minor role here. McNaught's prose seems forced and the narrative doesn't flow as her work usually does.<br />Leigh Kendall is a talented Broadway star, married to Logan Manning, a renowned architect from an old, established New York family. They had married at a very young age and built their individual careers during their marriage. The two planned to construct a dream house, Logan's design, in the mountains near New York City. Late one snowy Sunday night, after a performance, Leigh drives upstate to meet Logan at their newly acquired property. She is forced off the road and fortunately escapes the accident with her life. When she regains consciousness in the hospital, she finds two NYC detectives ready to question her about the accident...and about her husband who has gone missing. And he remains missing. Leigh begins to discover many things she has never known about Logan's life, even though she believes that they had a very close and loving relationship. She senses that the police suspect she knows something about her husband's disappearance, when in reality her world has turned upside down. She feels frightened, alone and isolated. The people she has trusted for years become like strangers, as she uncovers more information about Logan's business and personal life. And a stranger is slowly becoming much more than a friend.<br />I will certainly not give-up on Judith McNaught because of one disappointing read.

Robert Littell has managed to write a densely plotted history of the Cold War and the CIA, spanning 45 years and almost 900 pages, without including a single boring moment. On the contrary, as one of the other reviewers noted, I was sorry to have the book end so soon. Littell manages his storylines, and characters so expertly that I had no difficulty keeping track of the events, the agents - single, double and triple, and all the political and undercover operations, the often deadly twists and turns, intrigues and espionage that actually happened in real life during the 20th century. If anything, the novel, which was impeccably researched, brought back the entire history of the Cold War to me, in many cases reminding me of the news events of my childhood.<br />&quot;The Company&quot; begins in 1947, when President Harry Truman established the Central Intelligence Agency. The main plot is centered on the personal and professional lives of three young CIA recruits, Jack McAuliffe, E. Winstrom Ebbitt III, (Ebby), and Leo Kritzky. The three men's various assignments with The Company take the reader through the Hungarian Insurrection, the building of the Berlin Wall, the behind the scenes reality of the plots to assassinate Fidel Castro and the fiasco at the Bay of Pigs, the Suez Canal crisis, the US and Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan in the 1980s, the aborted putsch again Mikhail Gorbachev, and all the other events that made up the period in world history known as the Cold War.<br />The novel weaves a fine tapestry of historic and fictional characters who participated in real life events which shaped today's world. The book almost reads like nonfiction. Figures like Harvey Torriti, code named &quot;the Sorcerer,&quot; the hard drinking cowboy, who is the super effective head of Berlin base at the beginning of the Cold War, populate the novel. There are the equally effective KGB, M-16 and Israeli Mossad counterparts, all running agents in the field, all manufacturing disinformation and managing top secrets. The KGB operative, Yevgeny Tsipin and Soviet spymaster Starik (the Old Man), also play major roles in this saga. The author captures the camaraderie and esprit de corps of the men and women in the CIA - their discipline, dark humor, and high expectations, of themselves and each other.<br />Mr. Littell's introduction of actual historical figures really heightens the book's interest. The defection of the British moles, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess to the Soviet Union is recounted in the most chilling manner. Littrell raises the suspense level considerably when he shows the close and trusting friendship between Philby and the CIA's historic counterespionage chief, James Jesus Angleton. Harold Wilson, Eisenhower, President John Kennedy and his brother Bobby, Kruschev, Ronald Reagan, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Henry Kissinger, William F. Buckley, G. Gordon Liddy, and even the upwardly mobile Vladmir Putin have roles in this epic historical novel, as do all the former CIA directors. Frank Sinatra, Judith Exner, Marilyn Monroe, Sam Giancana and other mob figures also have bit parts.<br />Littell's book is absolutely riveting.

I doubt this will be a popular review, but I feel obliged to tell it like I see it...or read it, in this case - and &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; is a waste of time! I have now read all of Dan Brown's books and am a big fan. Brown tackles unusual subjects, conducts impeccable research on his topics and writes fabulous suspense thrillers, with the exception of this one. His characters are cardboard, totally without depth. The plot could have been believable but it is not written in a credible or logical manner. The action is chaotic - and there is too much action and too little substance here.<br />The National Security Agency, (NSA), has a top secret, totally invincible code-breaking machine called TRANSLTR, especially effective against advanced electronic terrorism. A disgruntled ex-NSA employee, Ensei Tankado, is a genius computer programmer and author of encryption algorithms. He has written a program that creates unbreakable codes and is using this program to blackmail NSA. Tankado wants a public disclosure of TRANSLTR. This multibillion dollar wonder machine that supports the CIA, FBI, DEA, IRS, etc., and traces &amp; monitors drug cartel shipments, corporate money transfers and terrorists chatter on the Internet, also grossly violates human rights. It is able to open and read everyone's email and reseal it without public knowledge. The US government has the capability, with TRANSLTR, of violating the privacy of computer users around the world. And Tankado is sworn to protect the peoples' right to privacy. Sounds like a terrific plot, right? That's why I bought the book.<br />Enter Susan Fletcher, the beautiful, talented, brilliant NSA cryptologist and mathematician who steps in to investigate the unbreakable code that threatens to render TRANSLTR useless. What she uncovers should be shocking and terrifying, but it isn't. It's blatantly unbelievable. The theory is realistic, but the people who take action, and their different rationales, are totally ludicrous. How could people like this be in charge of national security? I could understand a bad apple, or even two - but there are just too many wackos populating this novel, and all with mega-responsibility. It would be horrifying if there were a secret code that would cripple US intelligence systems. But Brown tampered too much with a potentially great plot. He has Susan's boss, Commander Strathmore, deputy director of NSA's CRYPTO facility, send Susan's fiance to Spain on a Top Secret errand...and the fiance doesn't even work for NSA! He's a foreign language professor! Apparently Strathmore has his own agenda, which is ridiculous and totally weakens the storyline. There is unnecessary globetrotting, too many needless murders, silly dialogue, uncalled for disasters, etc., etc. If Dan Brown were not the author, I would have closed the book before the halfway mark. I kept waiting for the author to make some sense out of all the malarkey.<br />There is so much potential here for a super suspense techno-thriller. And the issue of where to draw the line between national security and personal freedom is a wonderful one to explore. Unfortunately the novel contains too many special effects, unbelievable subplots and flat characters...and all the above mentioned needless action. The fascinating information about real life technologies, cryptography and the battle for privacy in cyberspace is lost in the mega-murders and catastrophes that plague this novel. If you are intrigued by the subject matter, then by all means read the book, and you may even enjoy it. It seems that other reviewers have. I don't often award 1 Star, but I really believe that that's all this novel deserves.

This novel, which should have been her strongest, as Mia, her protagonist is the most powerful and interesting of the sister witches, falls into cliche and repetition. It is just plain boring and a big disappointment.<br />Three Sisters is a small, rocky island off the coast of Massachusetts. Legend has it that the island was once a part of the mainland. Back in the late 1600s, during the Salem witch trials, three sisters, good witches all, known as Fire, Earth and Air, conjured the island and made it a haven against persecution. Unfortunately, the sisters did not fare as well as their island. All three were doomed by unfortunate relationships and a misuse of power. Before the last sister died she cast a spell to keep the island safe for 300 years. At that time she prophesied a reunion of three sisters, descendants of the original three, who would join together to redeem their ancestors, right the wrongs of the past and save their home from destruction.<br />Mia Devlin, owner of the successful bookstore-cafe on Three Sisters Island, is a strong sorceress, of the white witch variety. She lost the love of her life, Sam Logan, when he left her without warning or explanation ten years before. Mia has closed herself off from intimacy to avoid the fate that destroyed her ancestress 300 years earlier. Sam returns to the island looking to renew his relationship with Mia and runs into a brick wall. Although the chemistry between the two sizzles, Mia is determined not to let Sam back into her heart. As with her sister witches, Nell and Ripley, Mia must face the dangers of the curse that holds the island hostage. It is up to her to meet and challenge the evil that threatens to destroy her home and loved ones, and to triumph over it if she is to save them all.<br />Unfortunately, Ms. Roberts brings back the same old, now exhausted threads &amp; villains of books one and two, which do nothing to spruce up book three. What a disappointment!

She is the queen of old world charm, of romantic ambiance, bourgeois elegance and bohemian grit. Fine art and cuisine flourish here, as do sidewalk cafes, flea markets and Parisian attitude. The Pont-Neuf, along the banks of the Seine, is one of my favorite places in the world. Artist Alain Bouldouyre, a longtime resident of the City of Light is obviously another person who has been captivated by the delights of Paris. Monsieur Bouldouyre is an illustrator and the artistic director of Senso magazine.<br />This richly visual sketchbook, filled with Bouldouyre's elegant watercolors, brings the city to life, in all her glory. His sophisticated palette of colors and sensitive line brilliantly capture the historic architecture, contemporary street scenes, the beauty of the Seine and its banks. The Place de la Concorde is depicted at sunrise. Readers are given a poetic portrait of the various Arrondissements and their attractions at different times of day and night, in natural light and illuminated by streetlights. We are taken to the Louvre, the Opera and down less frequented side streets. Christophe Auduraud's narrative complements the illustrations. Auduraud is a film critic and novelist, and a past scholar of the Villa M&eacute;dicis, the French cultural institute in Rome.<br />The book has a lovely flow to it. It is handsomely bound with a linen spine and a color-washed cover painting. The paper is a heavy cream colored, heavily ribbed stock with notes written in longhand alongside the vibrant sketches. If you have been to Paris, this is a wonderful remembrance. If you have never been there, Bouldouyre' watercolors capture the city's essence better than any photograph could.<br />JANA	2003-11-16

Leonardo Da Vinci epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. He possessed one of the greatest minds of all times. Painter, sculptor, architect, engineer, scientist, Da Vinci personified creative genius and had an immeasurable effect on modern culture. This compilation of his work, probably the most complete collection ever made, is spectacular. The reproductions are riveting.<br />Taschen has reproduced here Leonardo Da Vinci's 34 paintings in glorious color. The paper quality is excellent as is the binding. From &quot;The Last Supper&quot; to the &quot;Mona Lisa,&quot; the paintings' details, even Da Vinci's brushstrokes, are clearly visible and exquisite. This 700 page book measures 22&quot; X 17&quot; when open and many of the artist's masterworks are shown with full page or double page details.<br />Frank Zollner biographical text is beautifully written and the book's first ten chapters explore Da Vinci's life, with excerpts from his letters, contracts and diaries. His painting are also discussed and interpreted here. A complete catalogue of Leonardo's paintings is included in Part II. Da Vinci's extraordinary talent as a draftsman is documented in the six hundred and sixty-three drawings which are presented in Part III. The drawings are arranged by categories, i.e., figures, anatomy, architecture, etc. Johannes Nathan's has written excellent commentary on Da Vinci's drawings and the artist's sensitive lines, both fine and bold, are truly a feast for the eyes.<br />&quot;Leonardo Da Vinci: The Complete Paintings and Drawings&quot; is one of the most visually stunning books I have ever seen. This was a &quot;must have/must own&quot; item for me, and I have spent many leisurely hours reading, perusing and enjoying this phenomenal collection.

Legend has it that the island was once a part of the mainland. Back in the late 1600s, during the Salem witch trials, three sisters, good witches all, known as Fire, Earth and Air, conjured the island and made it a haven against persecution. Unfortunately, the sisters did not fare as well as their island. All three were doomed by unfortunate relationships and a misuse of power. Before the last sister died she cast a spell to keep the island safe for 300 years. At that time she prophesied a reunion of three sisters, descendants of the original three, who would join together to redeem their ancestors, right the wrongs of the past and save their home from destruction.<br />Fast forward 300 years to Three Sisters Island. Ripley Todd is the town's deputy sheriff and she's an earthy, practical, no nonsense kinda gal - not at all the type one would peg for a witch. And make no mistake, Ripley is a witch although she tries very hard to deny her powers. Handsome, scholarly MacAllister Booke comes to the island to research the legend and to interview the one inhabitant he knows possesses magical powers - Mia Devlin, owner of the local bookstore cafe, and direct descendant of the original sisters. Booke has studied, recorded and witnessed the impossible for over 12 years. \\"He'd interviewed witches, ghosts, lycanthropes, alien abductees and psychics. Ninety-eight percent of them were delusional or con-artists. But the remaining two percent...well, that kept him going.\\" Imagine his surprise when he discovered that Three Sisters Island is the home of three witches, all descending from the original line - Nell Channing Todd (Ripley's new sister-in-law), Ripley and Mia.<br />He is immediately attracted to Ripley, who goes out of her way to be disagreeable to him. She wants nothing to do with magic or with anyone who is interested in the supernatural. However, the island's 300-year anniversary is coming up and Ripley has to come to grips with the powers that terrify her if she is going to help break the centuries-old curse and save her beloved home. Dr. Booke, Mia and Nell are behind Ripley all the way as she learns to manage her energy and fear.<br />\\"Heaven and Earth\\" is Nora Roberts' second book in the Three Sisters trilogy. You don't have to read the first book to enjoy this one, although it is a delight to continue with the story of Nell, Mia and Ripley. Ripley is a more difficult character than the other two sisters. She is abrasive, stubborn and initially did not fit my image of a witch. However, once the story is underway and Ripley's frailties are exposed, she becomes quite believable as a woman and a sorceress. Ms. Roberts creates a wonderful relationship between Ripley and Mac, as well as between the three woman. I wish the source of evil, thrills, chills and suspense were more original, and not something/someone dredged up from book one. The plot works well enough as is, but the novel would have been so much better with a new villain.

Three Sisters is a small, rocky island off the coast of Massachusetts. Legend has it that the island was once a part of the mainland. Back in the late 1600s, during the Salem witch trials, three sisters, good witches all, known as Fire, Earth and Air, conjured the island and made it a haven against persecution. Unfortunately, the sisters did not fare as well as their island. Air fell in love with a man who proved to be so abusive that he finally killed her in a fit of rage. The second sister, Earth, vowed revenge and when she destroyed her sister's killer, she broke her sacred promise to do no harm. The last sister, Fire, lost her love and in despair she took her own life. Before she died she cast a spell to keep the island safe for 300 years. At that time she prophesied a reunion of three sisters, descendants of the original three, who would join together to redeem their ancestors and save their home from destruction.<br />Fast forward 300 years to Three Sisters Island. A frightened young woman, Nell Channing, comes to the island fleeing her past. She has been drawn here through compelling dreams. Concealing her identity, with few possessions and no identification, she finds a job as a gourmet cook at a local bookstore and cafe. The cafe's owner and Nell's new boss, Mia Devlin, warmly welcomes her as if she is a long lost friend. She rents Nell a lovely cottage and helps her settle in. For the first time in many years Nell begins to believe she has found a home and a place to make her future. The town sheriff, tall, dark and handsome, (of course), Zack Todd begins to woo her and Nell is drawn to him in spite of her knowledge that she can never become involved.<br />Then the past finally catches up to Nell. The evil she has been trying to escape comes to the island, endangering her and threatening the lives of those she has come to love. The curse of Three Sisters and the legend behind it are disclosed. Nell discovers that she is one of the three who can break the centuries-old spell and save her home and her life - with the help of two other strong, gifted women whom she has grown to care for as sisters.<br />One of the other reviews called this novel a combination of &quot;The Witches Of Eastwick&quot; and &quot;Sleeping With The Enemy&quot; and I think that is an apt description. The suspense and sheer terror of being pursued by an enraged, abusive spouse is clearly portrayed here, embellished a bit with the addition of magic and the supernatural. And Nora Roberts depicts the love, camaraderie, humor and complexity of the relationship between the sister witches in wonderful detail. It is easy to love Ms. Roberts' characters as she develops them with great care. The sisters' magic is delightful, as is the romance. The story is appropriately chilling at times and filled with suspense. &quot;Dance Upon The Air&quot; is the first part of a trilogy. I have read all three books and this is my favorite.

The events are recounted in flashbacks to a time a few years before the present, and to a period during WWII in Italy. Underlying the entire narrative is the theme of Judas Iscariot. When I hear the name Judas, I immediately associate it with the word &quot;betrayal.&quot; Some of the questions this novel poses are, who was Judas? Did he betray? Has religious history given Judas a bad rap?<br /><br />Father Leo Newman, a Roman Catholic priest, is a biblical scholar working in Rome for the World Bible Center. He is an expert at deciphering, translating and interpreting the bits and pieces of ancient papyrus discovered in Near Eastern archeological sites that deal with biblical history, especially those pertaining to New Testament writings. Newman is lonely, middle-aged, and somewhat ascetic. When the novel opens, he finds himself at a crossroads of sorts, questioning the value of his passionless existence, his life's work in the Church and his faith in God. He thinks, at one point, &quot;And indeed, what kind of faith was it? A poor, dried-out thing, a construct put together of habit, defiance and anxiety.&quot; For the first time since his adolescence Leo finds himself attracted to a woman, Madeline Brewer, the wife of a British diplomat. Madeline, (and the author is quick to point out the similarity in the names Madeline and Magdalene), senses that the attraction is mutual and overtly pursues a friendship with the priest - and then a stronger emotional relationship, and then...much more.<br /><br />It is during this relationship between Madeline and Leo that papyrus fragments are discovered, in a dig near the Dead Sea, which may be the writings of Christ's disciple, Judas Iscariot. This potential &quot;Gospel of Judas&quot; could, if proved to be authentic, blow apart the foundation of Christianity and also the foundation on which Father Leo Newman has built his life. Newman is called upon to study the parchments for validation and interpretation.<br /><br />While Leo is taxing his emotional limits, dealing with the Judas Gospel and his adulterous relationship with Madeline, Simon Mawr takes us back further in time to Italy during the war years. He seeks to explain Leo's troubled past by giving the reader a glimpse of his German parents' lives, and their characters, during the years prior to his birth. What is revealed here is astonishing in itself, as a story of terrible pain, conflict and betrayal, and also in the parallels to the emotional upheavals that Leo Newman is experiencing in the present.<br /><br />Simon Mawr masterfully intertwines his stories as his characters cope with issues of faith, identity, responsibility, love, betrayal and loss - and what it means to believe. Betrayal permeates the narrative, beginning with relationships, events and lies which occur before Leo's birth, and continuing with his own, and Madeline's. The question also arises of whether to betray the truth - the facts of the new incendiary text, and perhaps, even the person who Judas was.<br /><br />Mawr's prose is extraordinary, as usual, his characters sensitive and believable, their development is solid, and his research is impeccable. I was left, however, with a feeling of dissatisfaction at the novel's conclusion. I grew to care about the people Mawr created, especially Leo Newman. I found myself drawn into their lives and psyches. Mawr's ending left me hanging. His intelligent narrative built considerable tension as the novel's various scenarios played out, but I was left feeling that many of the issues were never resolved adequately enough to dispel the tension. Nor did Mawr answer many of the questions the novel posed. After such a glorious telling, the tale ended on a flat note.<br />JANAhas built his life.

As I contemplate the man's actions and involvements, over the course of his lifetime, I try to come up with a clear definition of who he actually was. Malraux, a man who made such an impact on French culture and on the political scene of his time, was a novelist, critic, journalist, archaeologist, financial speculator, and political figure. He was a complex man, and an adventurer. In this extremely readable biography, Curtis Cate attempts to correct the image of Malraux as a heroic, committed activist and intellectual. Cate, however, does not delve deeply enough into how the political, cultural and social environment of the times impacted Malraux, and the biography comes up short as a consequence. I was left bewildered, occasionally, without an understanding of why Malraux made some of his choices, especially in politics, and Cate appears to be equally at a loss. The author covers a wide spectrum of material in this biography, and though he fails to draw credible conclusions in many instances, the nature of his subject alone makes reading this book an extraordinary experience.<br />Andre Malraux was born in Paris and was raised by his mother and grandmother. His parents were divorced. His father committed suicide in 1930. Malraux studied Oriental languages at the Ecole des Langues Orientales, although he did not graduate. At the age of 21 he left for Cambodia with his wife Clara Goldsmith. He was arrested and almost imprisoned for stealing a bas relief from the temple at Bantai Srey. The book details this &quot;youthful&quot; archeological expedition. In fact, this trip probably sparked the seed of revolution against colonialism in the young man.<br />After returning to France, Malraux became highly critical of the French colonial authorities in Indochina and in 1925 helped to organize the Young Annam League and founded the newspaper &quot;Indochina in Chains.&quot; He may also have worked for Kuomintang in China in 1927. On his return to France he published his first novel, &quot;The Temptation of the West&quot; (1926). This was followed by &quot;The Conquerors' (1928), &quot;The Royal Way&quot; (1930) and &quot;Man's Fate&quot; (French: La Condition Humaine) (1934), a powerful novel about the defeat of a communist regime in Shanghai and the choices the losers have to face. He won the 1933 Prix Goncourt of literature for the latter novel. In the 1930's Malraux also joined archeological expeditions to Iran and Afghanistan.<br />Malraux's anticolonial involvement in the Chinese, Spanish and Vietnamese revolutions, inspired a series of novels that propelled him into the limelight as a writer of great intelligence and insight. This very intelligence, along with his participation in the political upheavals of the time, make Malraux's story so gripping.<br />The book also delves into Malraux's service with the Republican Air Force during the Spanish Civil War, and his underground activities during WWII, when he worked for both British Intelligence and the French Resistance. These chapters in Malraux's life were a highpoint for me - thrilling reading! The bio also covers his postwar career as DeGaulle's Minister of Culture.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this somewhat flawed biography. Malraux was one of the most intriguing men of the 20th century. His need to experience danger, to risk his life on several occasions, and his desire to champion causes, made him a heroic and romantic figure. I am certainly inspired to read more of Malraux's work after finishing this book - an enjoyable and enlightening read.<br />JANAd in 1925 helped to organize the Young Annam League and founded the newspaper &quot;Indochina in Chains.&quot; He may also have worked for Kuomintang in China in 1927.

An extremist's bomb had killed almost 200 men, women and children. For more than half a century the Seattle clinic had provided full family services to the community, including multilevel family counseling, obstetric and gynecological services, and comprehensive day care facilities. The media had dubbed the Center an abortion clinic, and it had become the focus for pro-choice and pro-life extremists as a rallying point to further their causes. The local citizenry, the entire nation, are horrified and tremendous pressure is put on the police and FBI to capture, try, and execute the perpetrator.<br />A young, clean-cut Naval officer is finally arrested for the crime, and high powered defense attorney Dana McAuliffe, a partner at the prestigious Seattle firm of Cotter Boland and Grace is persuaded to take the case. Dana is brilliant, confident, successful, and has made her way in a primarily man's world. As she becomes more acquainted with her client and the facts of the case, she begins to seriously doubt his guilt. Organizations on both side of the abortion issue have a political hay-day over the trial. It is a presidential election year and the leading candidate has promised to do everything in his power to repeal Rowe vs. Wade. A friend of Cotter Boland and Grace's senior partner, who wishes to remain anonymous, is paying for the defense.

She has no clue as to her identity, but does know that she is very different from her classmates in more ways than she can understand. Herculine is accused of witchcraft, after a series of horrifying events occur at the convent, and is subsequently imprisoned to await mortal judgment. Sebastiana d'Azur, a beautiful witch, and Herculine's \\"Soror Mystica,\\" sweeps in to rescue the girl and spirits her away to Ravndal, an exotic retreat, where she is informed of her destiny. Herculine is apparently the only one who can liberate two lovers chained to earth forever. The very long tale of Father Louis and Madeleine de la Mettrie, who once lived in 18th-century France, is chronicled. These two beings, now elemental spirits, await Herculine's tuition in sorcery and hope for their release at her hand. At this point, some 300 pages into the story, the reader is further distracted with the tale of Sebastiana's apprenticeship in the Craft, Louis' trial for witchcraft, the terror of the French Revolution's aftermath, and the general comings and goings of a cast of gothic characters. All these tales are fascinating, to be sure, but there are too many, too late. Yet it is during these story fragments within a plotline that Reese comes into his own. His research is impeccable and his writing takes-off, as if no longer restrained by the tired chronicle of Herculine.<br />I was very disappointed in this book, Mr. Reese's first effort.

Jack Kerouac warned Joyce Johnson, nee Glassman, on the first night they spent together, back in 1957, &quot;I don't like blondes.&quot; In spite of their inauspicious beginning, Kerouac kept returning to Glassman over a period of two years, during which time he restlessly wandered the US and Mexico. They met on a blind date set up by poet Allen Ginsberg, almost a year before Kerouac's name became a household word with the publication of &quot;On The Road.&quot; She was an intelligent, talented, independent twenty-one year-old, and he was thirty-five, &quot;pop-culture's guy's guy,&quot; &quot;The King of the Beats,&quot; on the brink of enormous success.<br />This collection of letters, poems and postcards, between Kerouac and Ms. Glassman, written over a two-year period, are interspersed with Glassman's elegant, focused writing, as she poignantly comments on their relationship and the times. Glassman-Johnson wrote in her Beat Generation memoir, &quot;Minor Characters,&quot; &quot;If time were like a passage of music, you could keep going back to it till you got it right.&quot; This sense of sadness and longing permeates the book. She gives an insightful view of what it was like to be a &quot;liberated woman&quot; and an aspiring author back in the late 1950s. Her crowd may have been Beat Generation icons, but a double standard was still the norm. Glassman's struggle to be a writer of consequence, and her battle against the mores of the day, &quot;illustrate the disparity between the myth and reality of the Beat experience.&quot; She really shows what it was like to be young, female and Beat during the Eisenhower years.<br />Kerouac's correspondence, filled with his spontaneous prose and 50s slang, gives the reader an amazing portrait of his struggle with fame and the attacks by his critics against his subsequent works. Throughout his travels, he tried, in a limited way, to balance this important relationship with a woman who truly understood him more than most people ever would. He did show a capacity for tenderness, as he formed a bond with Glassman, who shared his passion for writing. Yet Glassman wanted a more lasting relationship, which eventually caused their break-up. &quot;You're nothing but a big bag of wind,&quot; she informed Kerouac before she left him. Eventually they did form a friendship. Most of the text is dominated by their romantic relationship. However, there are wonderful glimpses of the &quot;beatnik scene,&quot; Greenwich Village in the 50s, Allen Ginsberg, the Orlovskys, Elise Cowan, and Neal Cassidy.<br />This is as much the story of Joyce Glassman Johnson's growth as a woman and writer, as it is about Jack Kerouac and the Beat generation. &quot;Door Wide Open&quot; is an extraordinarily sensitive portrayal of a man, a woman, a relationship and a time that strongly influenced, (and still does), the arts, literature and culture in the US - a wonderful book!<br />JANAople ever would.

Edward Weston, more than any other photographer that I admire and have studied, succeeded in creating photography as art. His abstract and voluptuous landscapes of the human form, his photographic sculptures of organic matter, his special vision that captured unnoticed works of art in nature, bring extraordinary passion and life to black and white photography. His exploration of &quot;the universality of basic form&quot; has provided us with masterpieces of photographic art. Much of Weston's best work is featured in this large and exquisite book. Published in London in association with the Huntington Library, printed and bound in Italy, and issued on fine paper approaching photographic print quality, this book is certainly a wonderful legacy of Edward Weston and his work.<br />In 1937 and 1938, the Guggenheim Foundation paid Weston to take a two-year photographic trip though California and the West - he was the first photographer to be awarded a Guggenheim fellowship - the images he made during that trip - more than 500, were presented to the Huntington Library. &quot;What it all comes to is this,&quot; Weston wrote the Guggenheim Foundation in 1939, &quot;I want very much to have a collection in the Huntington Library and will do anything I can to make it possible.&quot; &quot;Edward Weston: A Legacy&quot; organizes much of this material - extensive commentary, notes, biographical information and career-long examples of Weston's photographs. It is a truly stunning compilation.<br />Weston's work evokes warmth, sensuality, the erotic. There is passion behind his photographs of animals, like the fleet fox, his portraits, and in his strange visions of antique statuary. His nudes, especially the extraordinary work he does with Charis Wilson, take the viewer beyond the erotic to a discovery of eternal forms.<br />This is a magnificent book containing a master's work - a real treasure!<br />JANA	2003-10-29

Beautiful illustrations highlight this delightful treasure house of Mexican recipes and fascinating anecdotes of Frida Kahlo. Guadalupe Rivera, Frida's stepdaughter, has gathered here favorite recipes for more than 100 authentic Mexican dishes, that Frida Kalho served to family and friends over the course of her life. This wonderful collection also contains family photographs and some wonderful reproductions of her paintings. Ignacio Urguiza transports the reader, through his glorious photographs, to many of Frida's favorite places, including her blue house in Coyoacan. Urguiza's photos of exotic dishes and settings are visually stunning.<br />The book is divided into twelve chapters, one for each month of the year, each section a fiesta for the palate and for the eyes. There is a description for every festival and family event celebrated here, along with photographs, illustrations and fond memories, all woven together to provide a fabric of Mexican life and Frida's life. Events celebrated here include Frida's wedding to Diego Rivera, a Mexican national holiday, dinner after the opening of one of Frida's exhibits, Frida's birthday and the Feast of the Holy Cross. From an unusual recipe for black Oaxacan mole, an exquisite sauce of chilies, nuts, spices, tomatoes, garlic, onion and Mexican chocolate, to fresh corn tamales, squash blossom budin, lamb with drunken sauce and delicious meatballs in chipotle sauce, this is a book that will stimulate your senses. All the recipes are easy to follow and the results are marvelous.<br />I bought this book as a birthday present for a friend and wound up buying another for myself.

A mass shooting in a primary school brings terror to the peaceful community of Bakersville, Oregon. Thirteen year-old Danny O'Grady, son of the town sheriff, has confessed to murdering two young children and his computer teacher, but evidence points to another killer.<br />Police Officer Rainie Connor, a lifelong resident of Bakersville, leads the homicide investigation, her first. She is a close family friend of the O'Grady's and has watched Danny grow up. Dealing with the boy's rage, which provoked the terrible tragedy, brings back excruciating memories from her past, and terrible secrets that she can never reveal.<br />Supervisory Special Agent Pierce Quincy, of the FBI, (or SupSpag as Rainie calls him), is an expert profiler who comes to this town in turmoil to assist Rainie. What they discover together is absolutely chilling. It certainly makes for a non-stop read.<br />I wouldn't ordinarily have chosen to read a book dealing with school shootings and mass murders, but this novel came highly recommended and I am glad I gave it a try. Lisa Gardner, like many Americans, has been extremely disturbed by the terrible shootings that have taken place in our schools. This novel is a result of her attempts to understand why these mass murders of young innocents occur, and what can be done to prevent them. The quality of psychological analyses and research that went into &quot;The Third Victim&quot; are impressive. Gardner's characters, especially Rainie, Quincy, young Danny and his family are well developed and realistic. I am impressed that Ms. Gardner did not demonize Danny or stereotype his parents, but instead wrote a compelling profile of a young man on the brink and a family in crisis.<br />The novel is riveting - an excellent psychological thriller with an unexpected ending.<br />JANA	2003-10-29

Late one afternoon Peter Scuro, a thirty-six year-old out of work actor, hits his favorite Manhattan bar, aptly named the \\"Loser's Place,\\" after being told by yet another casting director that they're looking for a \\"younger type.\\" Peter is on his second martini when a woman, covered in mink, wearing dark glasses, hands him fifty dollars and asks him, \\"your place?\\" Outside, waiting for a cab, he asks, \\"Why me?\\" She answers, \\"You look reasonably clean.\\" She turns out to be Martha Twombly, late forties, dependent on make-up, hairdresser, and aerobics for her passing looks. Confident, she cruises when \\"in the mood.\\" Martha and Peter get to know each other a little better, if that is possible, and come up with an outrageous business plan.<br />They decide to provide a service for bright, successful, wealthy and/or lonely women who are looking for a male company, but not emotional attachments - women who will pay for what they want. Peter and Martha open an exclusive establishment where moneyed women can buy their fantasy, for an hour or so. The idea takes-off and the business becomes successful and expands. Problems arise, including those unique to the business of prostitution.<br />This is as much a character study as a thriller or mystery. Martha describes Peter perfectly when she tells him, \\"You are in the flesh game because you like easy money, you enjoy sex, you like women, you like to be on, you like to live by your wits, you can't stand the thought of a regular nine-to-five job - you've got a million motives for doing what you're doing.\\" Yet Peter also seeks intimacy and never expects to come into contact with violence. He strives to become part of the \\"overworld,\\" of wealth and power - one of the movers and shakers - but doesn't realize how much violence can be involved in achieving his vision of success.<br />Lawrence Sanders has written a different kind of book with \\"The Seduction Of Peter S.\\" It is edgey, but is also filled with humor. Some of the vignettes of the male prostitutes and their female tricks are very funny, as are many of the characters and their foibles. One of Sander's premises is that women have achieved equality with men in many areas, so why not in the world's oldest profession - with a role reversal?

I am dropping pounds, not feeling hungry, and ready to experiment with low carbohydrate food recipes, as I have grown a little bored with broiled meats, fish, omelettes and plain salad.<br />I picked up a copy of &quot;Dr. Atkins' New Diet Cookbook: With Dr. Atkins' New Carbohydrate Gram Counter,&quot; tried many of the recipes and have been thrilled with the gourmet results. All recipes follow the same high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet (including the complex carbohydrates). From appetizers, meat, poultry and fish dishes, to scrumptious desserts, the results are wonderful. The cheesecake is loaded with cream cheese, eggs, cream fraiche, uses a sugar substitute and is out of this world. My diet is much more varied now and food actually seems to taste better than before I began the diet. The carbohydrate counter included in the book is invaluable.<br />I also want to add that exercise is so important in the weight loss process. Even walking for a half hour everyday will help considerably. Dr. Atkins was scorned for many years for his weight loss program and healthy diet theories, but over time, with much research, he has been proven correct.

Her alcoholic father abandons Faith, along with her promiscuous older sister, two rowdy older brothers and retarded baby brother while on the road. Her brothers strike out on their own and social services finally places the three remaining children with foster families. Can it get any sorrier than this??<br />Years later, a mature, successful, absolutely gorgeous Faith returns to Prescott to find out what really happened the night her mother and Guy's father left town.

Essentially, this novel is about three generations of police chiefs in Delano, Georgia, who attempt to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of several young men, and capture the elusive serial killer who victimizes them.<br /><br />However, Edgar Award-winning novelist Stuart Woods has written not only a riveting mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat, compulsively turning pages, he has described the history and culture of a small Georgia town from 1919 through the 1960s, and created such a realistic a populace that, at times, it is difficult to believe this is a work of fiction. Woods' characters are well defined and complex. There are many good moral people who live in Delano, but there are also the corrupt and perverse, those who have many secrets to hide. The story of the town's growth, as well as that of its inhabitants, over the years is absolutely fascinating, as are the details and intrigues of Georgia's state politics.

Debbie Lee Wesselmann has created one of the most original storylines I have read in a long time. And if the plot doesn't immediately capture your interest, her magical characters will. They are irresistible.<br />Michelle Trutor left Boston in a hurry. She is finally fleeing an abusive relationship, leaving her possessions and past behind and temporarily moving to Derbysville, NH. Arthur Wharton, a dear friend she met in an evening philosophy class, taught by her ex, has invited her to stay with him and his family for a while. Trutor nicknamed the old man &quot;the Balloonist&quot; because his eccentric dress evoked humorous images of him piloting a balloon, and soaring over the New England countryside. His Victorian home in Derbysville, thought to be haunted by many, is inhabited by Arthur, his twin Proctor, and their bizarre niece Roberta. Caroline, Arthur's and Proctor's adopted sister, left the house to the twins and Roberta, to remain in their possession only if they adhere to some pretty unconventional conditions. The Balloonist asks Trutor to open the locked door to Caroline's past and write the biography of the many faceted and very talented woman who raised the brothers and their niece. The quest to discover who Caroline was is an enchanting adventure, filled with delightful riddles and much mystery.<br />Underlying the novel's light tone is the dark menace of domestic abuse. Most of the people in the novel have been victims and their fear, which surfaces from time to time, and the impact the abuse has wrought in their characters permeate the story. A particular passage struck me as summarizing the justification behind the hurt Caroline has inflicted on so many. It is from her diary. Burdened at too young an age with tremendous responsibility for which her years could never have prepared her, she writes: &quot;Today, I have discovered that one is not remembered long for love. Hatred, pure evil deeds, are forever. One can so injure an individual that he is from that moment changed, and he in turn passes these seeds of malice to everyone he meets. After all of my helplessness, I finally wield power.&quot;<br />Ms. Wesselmann's prose is lyrical, her characters complex, endearing, and often outrageous, the dialogue engaging. The mix of light and dark throughout this well crafted novel keeps the reader on edge. Once I began this very unusual book I could not put it down.

I was enchanted by the magic lore of the Learned people included here, as well as the ring of sacred stones and the legend of the rowan tree that can be seen in bloom only by true lovers. This is one of Ms. Lowell's most sensuous stories and most entertaining reads.<BR>JANA	2003-10-23

Questions about God have probably existed for as long as mankind has existed. Who is God? What is God? Does God exist? How does he fit into our lives? The authors of the newly revised &quot;Finding God: Selected Responses,&quot; Rifat Sonsino and Daniel B. Syme, objectively present a variety of approaches to the profound questions about the divine being we call God. This very readable book offers a historical review of how theologians and philosophers have viewed God, over a period of thousands of years, without pushing a single approach, or suggesting that the reader believe anything at all. This is a wonderful resource book that I originally read for a class and have reread, and passed along to others, since then.<br />Jewish scholars have debated the nature of God for millennia. This short book packs a lot into each chapter as the authors present over a dozen views of Jewish thinkers and teachers, including those who transcribed, or wrote the Bible, the great Rabbis quoted in Rabbinic literature, Philo, Maimonides, Luria, Spinoza, Buber, Steinberg, Kaplan, Fromm, Heschel, and Alvin Reines.<br />The authors wrote in their Introduction: &quot;This is a book about God. More specifically, it is a book about ways in which Jews have spoken of God through four thousand years of Jewish history. This book will not attempt to tell you what to believe as a Jew. Rather, it will present a spectrum of theological options that have been explored and affirmed by great Jewish thinkers, ancient and modern.&quot; The authors take care to point out that in the Jewish tradition, there is no one &quot;correct&quot; way to think of God. &quot;Finding God&quot; offers a solid foundation to begin the exploration of the concepts of God.<br />Rabbi Rifat Sonsino, rabbi of Temple Beth Shalom in Needham, MA, and Rabbi Daniel B. Syme, spiritual leader of Temple Beth El in Bloomfield Hills, MI, wrote, &quot;If we make it possible for one Jew to reclaim his or her Jewish spiritual identity, if we help others to begin to talk about God without ambivalence or embarrassment, if we serve as a catalyst for further study of these and other Jewish thinkers, we will consider our work worthwhile.&quot;  This is an extraordinary book, beautifully written, and is most worthwhile.<br />JANAwe help others to begin to talk about God without ambivalence or embarrassment, if we serve as a catalyst for further study of these and other Jewish thinkers, we will consider our work worthwhile.&quot;  This is an extraordinary book, beautifully written, and is most worthwhile. <BR>JANA	2003-10-23

JPS' &quot;Hebrew-English Tanakh: The Traditional Hebrew Text And The New JPS Translation&quot; is the best Bible I have seen for the purpose of study. The translation is superior and when in doubt, the Hebrew text is right there, alongside the English, to compare. This edition was recommended to me when I began a two year course on Judaism and Jewish Life sponsored by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br />This JPS edition of the Tanakh, composed of the Pentateuch, the Nevi'im (Prophets), and the Kethuvim (Writings), was translated from the original authoritative Hebrew text into the modern idiom of English in three stages, representing the collaboration of academic scholars with rabbis from the three major branches of organized Jewish life in America. The Torah was published in 1962, The Prophets in 1978, and the Writings in 1982. The text preceding the Preface, and the Preface itself, include an excellent history of the Hebrew text.<br />I have read this edition through, and find it to be a most rewarding experience. The English translation is the closest to the original Hebrew that I have seen. The print is clear and easy to read and the notes are superior. The Hebrew font is large enough to read without eye strain, and includes vowels - which is a plus for me. And the book is beautifully bound. I continue to refer to it almost daily for study purposes and for my own personal edification. I think this is one of the best book purchases I have ever made.<br />JANA	2003-10-23

I have read all of her novels and have been captivated, time after time, by her characters and engrossing storylines. &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; is not one of Ms. Picoult's best efforts, however. This novel of the relationship between a Hollywood super star and a brilliant and acclaimed anthropologist is too contrived for my taste. She writes about an important and difficult societal issue here, but the complexity and real drama of her story are diminished by the unnecessary glitter of her characters and the addition of a subplot, so tangential, it is superfluous.<br />Cassie Barrett is a physical anthropologist and lecturer at UCLA. She has been assigned to work at one of the university's sites in Tanzania for the semester when she is disturbed by the crew of a film production company in the process of making a movie. Since the film just happens to feature an anthropologist, she is recruited as a consultant and meets super star actor and heartthrob Alex Rivers. In a Cinderella romance with overtones of the &quot;Lifestyles Of The Rich and Famous,&quot; the two fall in love and marry. But gold does not lie beneath the glitter. Alex carries tons of baggage from an abusive childhood. Cassie has baggage of her own. Picoult describes the psychological dynamics of the couple with a sharp and knowing eye. Her characters are finely drawn, realistic and compelling. Characters and a parallel story are introduced that would make an interesting novel in itself, but are so removed from the main plot that their presence is distracting. I was left with a feeling that the author had added apples to oranges and hoped to come up with a logical rational for her character's actions. This is not typical of Ms. Picoult's usual taut plots and tight writing style. Apples and oranges do not mix well in this novel and I was left hungry.<br />JANA	2003-10-20

Gail Connor, successful litigation attorney and single Mom is back along with daughter Karen, ex-husband Dave, and hunky fiance Anthony Quintana with a suspense thriller that will keep you up reading way past bedtime.<br />Gail, as always, is trying to juggle motherhood, her career, and her relationship with Quintana, a Cuban American defense attorney, and frequently comes up short. With her marriage only weeks away, a new house to be renovated, a troubled adolescent daughter, and an ex-husband who is battling her for custody of their child, she has more on her hands than usual. She is presently working on a difficult divorce case involving a millionaire, who pleads poor, and his abused wife. Then Gail receives a chilling anonymous phone call threatening her life. The call is repeated and her car is vandalized. Next, and most frightening, her daughter's life is threatened. Gail panics. If all this isn't enough to stress her out completely, she begins to suspect Anthony of shady dealings with organized crime.<br />Barbara Parker is at her best with this fourth novel in the Gail Connor series. Along with the chilling mystery she delivers intelligent insight into the Miami Cuban American community, both cultural and political. It is not necessary to read the other books in the series to appreciate and enjoy this one. I have read all four novels, in order, and am more addicted to the stories of the lives of the main characters, and their development, than to the mysteries. The characters are some of the most original, realistic and compelling that I have discovered in light fiction. Ms. Parker's people are not always nice, and the friction in their relationships is familiar, refreshing and on target.

Author and literary critic Harold Bloom wrote of Charmaine Craig's \\"The Good Men: A Novel Of Heresy,\\" An authentic novel of heresy. The book is beautifully composed and darkly memorable. I have never read so powerful an account, fictive or historical, of the Cather rebels against the Catholic Church. Craig's vision encompasses an entire culture, which was forever destroyed.\\"<br />When she was fourteen years old Grazida Lizier became the lover of a Catholic priest, a close friend of her mother. Grazida was consequently charged with incest and heresy when the Inquisition came to town in 1320. Set in the mountain village of Montaillou, in southwestern France, the story follows the passions of various characters torn between the desire for spiritual grace and fleshly pleasure, particularly the village priest, Pierre Clergue, who throughout his life is obsessively attracted to three generations of women in his brother's family. Grazida Lizier is the central figure in the novel, and through Ms. Craig's powerful prose the reader walks through the Inquisition in some of the victims' shoes.<br />The primary targets of the Catholic Church's inquisitors were the members of the Cather religious sect, known as the Good Men, of the book's title. The Good Men renounce all things earthly which they consider to be the creations of Satan. As they wait for the inevitable death that the Inquisition will bring, they travel the countryside as celibate monks, undermining the power of the official church.<br />This is the gripping epic story of what happened when religious persecution turned Christian against Christian, brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor. There is no evidence anywhere of Christian compassion or forgiveness in the ignorant people of the village or the Church which allowed and promoted slaughter in the name of religion.<br />Charmaine Craig's writing is elegant, elaborate, tight and somewhat distant, almost as though she is an objective observer of the events she documents and creates. This is an amazing novel, and it is Ms. Craig's first. Apparently, she was studying medieval history and literature at Harvard when she came upon the testimony of Grazida Lizier. She remained fascinated by the girl and her deposition, which defended her affair with a priest old enough to be her grandfather, until, years later she wrote this extraordinary novel.

Attorneys Gail Connor and Anthony Quintana are back in Barbara Parker's third mystery thriller about law, crime, politics and complex community, family and love relationships in Miami. This latest offering by Ms. Parker, highlighted by the culture and politics of Miami's Cuban exile community, is her best novel to date.<br />Gail and Anthony are now engaged to be married. As they become more involved with each other's families, she learns much about Anthony's past, and the very different person he was twenty years ago. Gail has left the prestigious law firm, where she worked for eight years, and has opened her own office. Among her clients is the Miami Opera, which she now represents. Talented opera singer Thomas Nolan, an old classmate, is to star in the opera's new production of Don Giovanni. However, his past visit to Cuba, and his potential connections to that island's government, can cause serious problems between the City Opera and Miami's Cuban exile community. Gail gains more insight into community tensions when she becomes better acquainted with Anthony's grandfather, who is a staunch supporter of the movement to overthrow the Castro regime. Gail, while searching for a way to continue with the opera's production without firing the star, discovers that the present political problem is intertwined with a violent incident from Anthony's past - when as a rebellious youth he went to Nicaragua with two friends and his young lover to work with the Sandinistas. As the facts emerge, she questions the validity of her relationship, and once again risks her life in her quest for answers. The usual murders and violence that are the flesh and bones of most mystery thrillers are present here. I find that the added information and plot twists involving Miami's Cuban exiles are fascinating and really provide an interesting glimpse into a little known subculture in America. As always, Ms. Parker's knowledge of the law adds much depth to the narrative.<br />The characters, Gail, Anthony, her daughter Karen, her mother and Anthony's family are all very well crafted figures and continue to grow and change with each book. Gail, as always, juggles her roles and responsibilities as mother, lover, daughter, friend, as well as her demanding career.

Brilliant, powerhouse lawyer Gail Connor is looking to make partner at her upscale Miami firm. Gail's marriage, already on the rocks when the novel begins, finally disintegrates leaving her to juggle motherhood alone, (she has a six year old daughter Karen), along with a career that takes up too much of her time. When her wild, free-spirited sister Renee is found brutally murdered, Gail's career is put on hold as she becomes the prime suspect. There has always been much sibling rivalry between the two, and Gail had always envied Renee's ability to garner favor and claim attention, even though she was the &quot;bad girl,&quot; while Gail tried so hard to be the &quot;good&quot; one. Add some fascinating secondary legal cases to the mix, along with a hunky Cuban American defense attorney who has his eyes on the lovely Gail, glimpses of Miami's &quot;old society, old money,&quot; alongside the city's darker side and you have the makings of a terrific mystery thriller.<br />Barbara Parker writes tight, taut prose and surely knows a lot about law and the legal world. Her characters are well defined and very believable, especially Gail Connor. Ms. Connor is not always likable. She is often stressed-out, as we all would be if faced with a failed marriage, a young daughter who is miserable with the sudden changes in her life, a demanding career that doesn't allow for time to cope with family problems, a sister's death and ensuing guilt because of their estrangement, and a murder investigation where all evidence points to her. She is frequently snappish, disagreeable, and not there for her child. Gail has many positive traits also, but what is so refreshing here is that the author gives her heroine normal human frailties - and a human face. One does not always have to like her for the novel to succeed. In fact, one of the reasons the plot is so successful is because the story and characters are so lifelike.<br />There are roller coaster twists and turns in this tale of old money, old secrets, and family loyalty and betrayal.

His son, two daughters-in law, three grandsons and a granddaughter, are all present when he informs them that they are to prepare for a visit from his new heir within the week. Lord Darricott's son and former heir had been recently killed in a boating accident and Darricott has had the unfortunate duty of recognizing the grandson he has never met, who will inherit the title and all his worldly goods upon his own demise. Hugh Darricott, the new and recent heir, had been raised in the North country, far away from the family seat, and now, in his mid-thirties has left the military with the rank of major. Hugh's father was disowned by the family patriarch after marrying a common weaver, and never seen by the family since. Lord Darricott, who rules his clan with an iron fist, except for granddaughter Anthea, who fears him not at all, has made plans that Hugh is to be schooled in the ways of a gentleman by his cousins. He also plans for Hugh to eventually marry Anthea, to prevent him from making an unsuitable match like his father did. The family, forming all kinds of stereotypical ideas about this base born cousin, is prejudiced against him before he arrives on the scene. And he is the last man Anthea wishes to marry.<br />Hugh arrives and, finding the group predisposed to dislike him, puts them on and plays the country bumpkin. He discovers each family member's weaknesses and strengths, their characters, and comes to know each of them, perhaps, better than they know each other. Hugh Darricott is much more intelligent and adept than the family gives him credit for and manages to uncover some family secrets, a ghost or two, and a crime in the making.

The mailman apparently &quot;did it.&quot; His fingerprints and teeth marks are found all over the corpse, and he is discovered at his own home, a short time after the murder, covered in the woman's blood. A neighbor witnessed the mail carrier running away from the crime scene, drenched in blood, at the approximate time the crime was committed.<br />Teddy Mack, a young attorney at the Barnett &amp; Stokes Law Firm, specializing in corporate law, is asked to defend the accused by the firm's senior partner, even though Mack has no experience as a defense attorney. Because of past personal issues, Mack is revolted by criminal law, and is reluctant to take the case. However, the request is made by his mentor, which makes it difficult to turn down. He is basically told that all he will be asked to do, since the defendant obviously committed the heinous crime, is to eliminate the death penalty as an option and make sure that the accused is sentenced to life in an institution for the criminally insane, as opposed to the state penitentiary.<br />As Mack explores the homicide and the investigation to prepare his defense, he discovers another similarly grisly murder - and another; murders committed while the defendant is behind bars. The city's populace panics that a serial killer is on the loose. As the bodies keep turning up, so does evidence of dirty politics and corrupt justice - a system that will indict, convict and kill the innocent in return for solving crimes and bringing in guilty verdicts.<br />Mack enters a world of terror and violence, confronting his own past demons, and a very real monster in the present. He fights to save a life, and discover the truth behind the aggressive prosecution and the history of death penalty sentences by a zealous DA.<br />Ellis writes a compelling story with well developed characters, a fascinating plot and subplots, and accurate and interesting detail of homicide investigations. Even the setting, Philadelphia, is unusual and provides a historical backdrop to this powerful novel. &quot;The Dead Room&quot; is also a psychological thriller.

Gabriel Garcia Marquez' \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude\\" is the literary equivalent of a magic carpet ride, your own magic genii come to life, and Shaharazade's 101 tales wrapped into one brilliant, multilayered epic novel. From page one you will voyage with the most remarkably original cast of characters, through worlds of vibrant color, where the sun shines almost always - when not obscured by a four year downpour. You will find yourself laughing out loud when you are not sobbing in sympathy with someone dying of heartbreak. I do not like to label Sr. Garcia Marquez' work \\"magical realism.\\" There is no label to accurately describe the writing that gifted us with \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude.\\" This is a book that defies description. You must read it to experience the fantastically real world of Macondo, and the people who live there. Once you know them, they will be a part of your own world forever. Have you ever looked at a painting, walked into it and become a part of it? When you open this novel at page one, you are beckoned to enter.<br />Macondo is a mythical South American town, founded, almost by accident, by Jose Arcadio Buendi­a, and populated primarily by his descendants. This is the story of one hundred years in the life of Macondo and its inhabitants - the story of the town's birth, development and death. Civil war and natural calamities plague this vital place whose populace fights to renew itself and survive. This is a huge narrative fiction that explores the history of a people caught up in the history of a place. And Marquez captures the range of human emotions and the reasons for experiencing them in this generational tale.<br />There is much that is delightful and comical here. Surprises never cease, whether it be Remedios ascending, or a man whose presence is announced by clouds of butterflies. There is satire, sexuality and bawdiness galore. But there is also a pervading sadness and futility that permeates throughout. Cruelty is a reality in Marquez' world, as are failure, despair and senseless, sudden violence. The plot is filled with passion, poetry, romance, tragedy and the echoes of the history of Colombia and Latin America.<br />I first read \\"One Hundred Years Of Solitude\\" in 1968, while living in Latin America. I have read it 2 or 3 times over the years, always picking up new pieces of wonder that I had previously missed. This is my favorite novel, and I am an avid reader.

Venetia is also quite lovely, but her character is so good and strong, that were she only half as beautiful, she would still outshine her peers.<br />Venetia Lanyon is twenty-five years old, orphaned, and responsible for her frail younger brother Aubrey, who is crippled by a disease of the hip-joint. She is also legally responsible for the family manse and lands in Yorkshire, while their older brother and heir, Conway, is away at war in France. Although Venetia has much going for her in the way of looks, charm and intelligence, and has two loyal suitors nearby, she is determined not to wed unless it is for love. Her father, when he was alive, was a recluse and showed little interest in his children except to forbid Venetia's coming out in London society, sponsored by her very willing aunt. Unaware of the unattached treasure in Yorkshire, London society and many probable excellent matches had to get by without Venetia.<br />Then, quite by accident, Venetia meets her neighbor, Lord Damerel, who has rarely visited his land since he returned from exile. Damerel is charismatic but not handsome, middle-aged and quite the worst rake, having flown the country with another man's wife years before. Since that liaison broke up, he has been leading a fast, devil-may-care existence and is not received in respectable society. Of course the lady and the rogue are quite taken with each other, and of course many complications ensue. Yet it is clear from their first meeting that the two are soul mates. This is most definitely not the same tired story of good girl meets bad boy and reforms him, etc. - not with Georgette Heyer at the helm.<br />Ms. Heyers plot and prose are tight, her writing marvelous, and her wit at its best both in the wonderful dialogue between all the characters, and in the many twists and turns the story takes. Venetia is truly amazing with her matter-of-fact air when faced with outrageous circumstances. And Damerel is a most wonderful dark hero, who finally sees the light. Their exploits are delightful. And Ms. Heyer is able, as always, to build sexual tension to a peak with never more than a kiss between the lovers. Her descriptions of the North Country are lyrical, her unusual cast of characters are well developed, and her description of England during the Regency period is very accurate and fascinating. Superb humor and irony are liberally sprinkled throughout.<br />This is a wonderful novel, and probably my favorite Regency Romance.<br />JANA- not with Georgette Heyer at the helm.<br />Ms. Heyers plot and prose are tight, her writing marvelous, and her wit at its best both in the wonderful dialogue between all the characters, and in the many twists and turns the story takes.

Janelle Denison's \\"Wilde Thing\\" reminds me of the soft porn flicks that were so popular in the 1970s. There's minimal plot and even less character development sandwiched in between many pages of hot sex. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against erotica, but I was expecting much more when I picked up this highly recommended romance from a used book store. Without a decent plot and characters I can relate to, I am left cold by what could otherwise be very steamy read!<br />Liz Adams, owner of a coffee house, has been eyeing tall, dark, handsome, bad boy Steve Wilde when he comes in for his daily caramel frappuccino, extra caramel - do bad boys really drink this stuff?? Wilde has obviously been checking Liz out too. When Liz' cousin goes missing, she is advised by a friend to call on Wilde, who is an excellent PI. She does and they really get it on - no strings.<br />Liz' cousin Valerie is a phone sex operator and party girl. She was supposed to be going away for a weekend with someone she met \\"on the job,\\" but after almost a week goes by and no Val, Liz feels that something bad may have happened to her. Steve and Liz both think that the only way to get information on Val's client/boyfriend is for Liz to go undercover as a phone sex operator at \\"The Ultimate Fantasy.\\" Much phone sex and a big, bad party later the mystery is almost solved and lust has turned to love for P.I. Wilde - but Liz is afraid to commit. You can take it from there.<br />I will say that the erotica is well written, and I probably would have rated this higher than 3 stars if there had been more meat to the plot.<br />JANA	2003-10-02

Thus begins a roller coaster series of events that will forever change her life.<br />Maddie lives in Frog Point, Ohio, a very small town where everybody knows everybody's business, and the business of their neighbor's long dead ancestors to boot. Maddie, forever the good girl, has never given anyone anything but \\"nice\\" things to say about her, her daughter Emily, and her soon-to-be-in-divorce-court husband Brent. Not even her mother, nor her best friend since grammar school, know how unhappy she has been with her marriage to a man who is not often home, and disinterested when he is. She had threatened to leave him once before when he cheated on her, but this time she is positive - the marriage must end.<br />Then her old high school flame turns up at her door. Says he's looking for Brent. Maddie hasn't seen him for twenty plus years, and although she is distracted and upset, she still feels the chemistry radiating between them. Later, she confronts Brent with his infidelity. He becomes enraged and knocks her around - something he has never done in all their married life. He leaves, slams the door behind him, and Maddie never sees him again - alive! And Maddie is a prime suspect in the murder investigation.<br />This lighthearted romance, with a good mystery included, also deals with some serious issues - a youthful middle age woman's coming of age, among them. Ms. Crusie fills her novel with humor, terrific characters, and lots of good lovin'. Maddie's dilemmas just seem to grow in number, as she tries to prove her innocence, redefine her life and care for and protect her grieving daughter. Jennifer Crusie reminds me of a  Midwestern, Susan Isaacs, who is from Long Island.

With \\"Shutter Island\\" Dennis Lehane departs radically from the blue-collar, noir fiction of \\"Mystic River,\\" and the Boston PI series that initially marked him as a superb storyteller. As always, Lehane's prose is powerful and well crafted, but \\"Shutter Island disturbed me in a way that his other novels did not. Lehane explores the dark side of man in his fiction, the suppressed brutality lurking beneath the civilized surface. I somehow always knew where I stood while reading his other novels, although he frequently traveled new terrain, I had no problem staying with him. I found myself disoriented, at times, reading \\"Shutter Island.\\" This is no dark mystery thriller from Boston's working class streets, nor is it the powerhouse masterpiece that is \\"Mystic River.\\" This is a disquieting, multilayered, psychological thriller that deals with mental illness in a way that makes the disease palpably real. Lehane takes us on a journey into the heart of psychopathology, and the feeling of total disorientation is so strong that it is most disturbing. I was left with a downright creepy feeling when I finished the book, but I believe this is exactly what the author intended.<br />U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, take the ferry to Shutter Island, one morning in late summer, 1954, to investigate the disappearance of an inmate of the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Ashecliffe, the island's only facility, has a long and dark history. It is almost a gothic presence, looming over the island. Rachel Solando, a WWII widow who murdered her three children during a major episode of depression, has been a longtime patient at Ashecliffe. She somehow vanished from her locked and well guarded cell during the night. Daniels and Aule investigate the mysterious disappearance, with very little cooperation from the hospital staff, and decide that Rachel Solando must have had assistance in escaping, since she obviously couldn't make herself invisible and walk through a locked door. Lehane's tense, minimalist narrative, combined with the plot's twists and turns, leave the impression that no matter what evidence the marshals turn up about the patient, or about the hospital itself, nothing is ever really discovered. There is a feeling of foreboding that the investigators are not in charge of the case that brought them to the hospital, but are rather being led through a series of scenarios, planned in advance for their benefit. Then a violent hurricane breaks over Shutter Island, prisoners escape, and Mrs. Solandos is discovered during the chaos. The men are free to return on the next ferry out after the storm. But Teddy Daniels is not ready to leave. What has been a mystery now turns into a psychological thriller.<br />Daniels lost his wife in an arsonist's fire two years before and still mourns her deeply. The arsonist who caused his wife's death, Andrew Laeddis, is imprisoned at Ashecliffe Hospital, and Daniels has known this for a long while. He had been waiting for the opportunity to travel to Ashecliffe and meet Laeddis face-to-face. And this investigation provided him with the ideal opportunity. He is not sure if he will kill the man he believes murdered his wife, or if he will just accuse him, but Daniels does not want to leave the island without resolving the issue that has plagued him for so long. He knows in his gut that something is seriously wrong at the hospital. He mistrusts the hospital's administrators who have behaved in a suspicious manner since he and Aule arrived. He has doubts about the veracity of all the information they have been given. Daniels also believes that illegal surgery and experiments are being conducted on the most violent patients - experiments reminiscent of those performed on the concentration camp prisoners he saw during the war. He feels the hospital administrators may view him and his partner as a dangerous threat to their operation. Then Chuck disappears and Teddy Daniels realizes that he may never leave the island alive.<br />This is a superbly constructed novel that is filled with suspense and dark turns at almost every corner. The entire narrative is told from the point of view of Teddy Daniels. A sympathetic and well fleshed-out character, Daniels is an intelligent man, who appears very much in command and in control of himself. He has suffered much, during the war and with the death of his wife and the life he hoped they would have together. His dark dreams are vividly depicted and provide more clues to the mysteries on Shutter Island than do all the codes and pieces of evidence acquired during the four day duration of the story.<br />This is a novel that haunts, long after the last page has been read. It is, at times, chilling and definitely not for the faint of heart. Dennis Lehane proves, yet again, that he is one of America's best living novelists, who long ago surpassed the title of genre writer.

I began using Frommer's travel books/guides in the 1970s, for Central and South America, and Europe. They were my favorite guide books then, and are still the best, providing clear, concise information for the traveler, with a predominately midlevel budget range. All their books, however, usually contain excellent low-budget suggestions, as well as information provided for luxury accommodations. With that endorsement, I most highly recommend &quot;Frommer's Spain 2003.&quot; I have traveled in Spain widely, but that was 15 years ago. On a glorious return trip to Spain early last spring, I found the updated guide even more informative than the one I used so long ago.<br />&quot;Frommer's Spain 2003&quot; provides a wide range of suggested accommodations, from budget to luxury, and I decided, before my trip, on a lovely pension in Barcelona, which was my &quot;base of operations.&quot; I made reservations, by telephone, a month in advance and found the place, and the price, to be exactly as described, along with the excellent service. Frommer's suggested local restaurants became my favorites, and the owners of the pension also made some excellent suggestions. I selected my lodgings in Marbella (Costa del Sol), Grenada, Seville, and Madrid from Frommer's, as well, and although I clearly preferred some over others, I was comfortable at all. The information in the guide was accurate in all cases. My ideas for day trips, from each of these cities, were based on a combination of past experience, the advice of friends and Frommer's suggestions. Frommers had the best and most original information about off-the-mainstream places of interest, including festivals, fairs, markets, shopping, entertainment, nightlife, etc.<br />The fold-out country map, and city maps are extremely easy to follow. I have the world's worst sense of direction, and never got lost - even on my own, original walking tour of Barcelona's winding streets.<br />All of the many magnificent things to see in Spain, each city's major attractions, the museums, art, churches and galleries are obviously included. It is the selection of lesser known sites, and out-of-the-way itineraries that makes this guide so special. I have read that some people find the book to be too big or bulky. I find it to be just right, and never needed to refer to another guide during my entire trip.<br />For before trip preparation, you may wish to brush-up on Spanish history, art - whatever your area(s) of interest. If so, you will do well to look at books specifically on the topics of your choice. Frommer's does provide a BRIEF chapter of historical information. It may be sufficient for your needs, but I think it worth mentioning here.<br />Overall, this is the Best book to take, especially if you plan to take only one, to assist you in enjoying the glories of Spain, past and present!<br />JANApain, each city's major attractions, the museums, art, churches and galleries are obviously included.

This book expanded my vision of nature, and turned me on to the exquisite writing of Barry Lopez, who won the 1986 National Book Award for this classic work on the wild regions of the far north. &quot;Arctic Dreams&quot; is an extraordinary celebration of Arctic life and landscape which takes the reader on a journey to places rarely visited by man. Lopez' narrative does have a dreamlike quality, not only in its descriptions of nature at its most surreal, but in the absolute beauty of the writing itself. He does indeed capture the foreign reality of Arctic life, and death, with the loving care of an artist who places each brushstroke carefully on a canvas, bent on bringing the vision before him to others.<br />Mr. Lopez made a number of extended trips to Siberia, Greenland, and northern Canada, including Baffin Island, to observe the flora and fauna of the region - polar bears, killer whales, caribou, narwhals - as well as the spectacular Arctic landscape. He experienced eerie encounters with the aurora borealis, massive migrating icebergs, solar and lunar light, halos and coronas. And he experienced both the potential for catastrophic danger and the remarkable beauty that the Arctic land and sea offers. &quot;Spring storms can sweep hundreds of thousands of helpless infant harp seals into the sea&quot; - juxtaposed with, &quot;A tiny flower blooms in a field of snow touched by the sun's benevolent light.&quot; Through Mr. Lopez' eyes the breathtaking experience of the Arctic landscape and the people who inhabit it become palpably real. I was particularly moved by his intimate and compassionate descriptions of the indigenous people of this region, who so aptly illustrate how mankind is capable of living in harmony with his surroundings. Lopez' prose and his conclusions make the strongest argument possible to work for the ecological health of our planet, for the sake of life itself, and for the health of our imagination and sense of wonder at the magnificent.<br />As mankind grows closer to conquering the earth's last frontiers, the issue of exploitation and encroachment becomes greater. For anyone who advocates preserving the few remaining wild areas on our planet, &quot;Arctic Dreams&quot; is a welcome gift and a source of motivation. It also provides an extraordinary read, and, perhaps, an awakening to those who have shown little interest in earth's most mysterious places.<br />This is a magical book that will enchant and awe the reader.

This is a powerhouse of a novel that will have you reading compulsively until you've turned the last page, and will leave you deep in thought long after that. &quot;The Fall&quot; has achieved a place on my Top 10 list of favorite works of fiction.<br />Rob Dewer hears on the car radio that his old friend and mountain climbing partner, Jamie Matthewson, has fallen to his death while making an almost suicidal solo climb. Although the two men have not been in touch for years, the news hits Dewer hard, stirring up a series of memories and strong, unresolved feelings from long ago. He immediately turns his car towards Wales and begins a journey, not only to bring comfort to Matthewson's widow, his old friend and former lover, Ruth, but into the past where decades old secrets and betrayals are disclosed.<br />Author Simon Mawer writes, &quot;At some time or other you must confront your past. We are our past...There is nothing else, and none of it can be undone.&quot; Mawer visits the past of a group of people who are intimately connected through friendship, love, lust, jealousy, competition, hatred and blood ties. The enormous power of some of Mawer's characters is almost overwhelming at times, as is their extreme fragility and vulnerability. His prose is masterful and poignant. The plot is riveting, compelling, almost brutal, in its honesty. I have never been very interested in the sport of climbing, but Mawer's narrative transported me, time and time again, on exhilarating treks up mountainsides; the action so vividly described that I felt that I was one of the climbers. His descriptions of landscapes, both fierce and bucolic, are as visual as paintings. Mawer is indeed a master craftsman.<br />This is a novel of love, of moral choices and decisions that life forces us to make. Sometimes the repercussions of these decisions echo into the future, for generations to come. This is truly one of the most amazingly original novels I have read in years and it has effected me deeply. I cannot praise &quot;The Fall&quot; highly enough!<br />JANAdeeply.

Imagine landing totally naked in the middle of a brutal Michigan winter, amongst strangers, ten years in the future? Or twenty years in the past? Henry has been experiencing situations like these since he was five years old when he visited the Chicago Field Museum of Natural History at midnight, while his parents slept unaware that their tiny traveler had slipped through time's warp. He has even gone forward in time to accompany an older self, and gone backwards to comfort the small boy who he once was. Forever at the mercy of his unpredictable genetic clock, he longs to lead a normal life. \\"Sometimes it feels as though your attention has wandered for just an instant. Then, with a start, you realize... you've mislocated yourself again.\\"<br />It is during one of Henry's amazing time travels that he meets the precocious and engaging Clare, who is six years old. He is thirty-six at the time. Of course, having foresight and hindsight, Henry knows that he and Clare will marry one day, when she is twenty and he is twenty-eight. And so begins the extraordinary and enchanting relationship between Henry and Clare. Clare will learn to cope with a lifetime of Henry's bewildering disappearances and reappearances, with a world that can change in a heartbeat, in exchange for being with her soulmate, for a time.

Diana Ransom is a 30 year-old psychologist/therapist, who lives in San Francisco, and carries around lots of excess emotional baggage - \\"physician heal thyself.\\" While growing up she was very close to her sister Clare, & her cousin Keely. Clare and Keely were aspiring young artists. Diana's creative outlet was through her strong, very vivid dreams and fantasy life, which she was able to create, control and mold at will. Diana's and Clare's parents and Keely's mother were killed in a terrible accident, Keely was separated from the girls by her father, and Clare, who had just reached her majority became young Diana's guardian. After the sisters' terrible loss, Clare began a relationship with a handsome, magnetic man, who she never introduced to Diana. She gave herself over to him completely, until he seemed to drain the very life from her. When he left her she became apathetic, with no will to live. Clare committed suicide. Diana stopped dreaming after her sister's death, but has remained firm in her resolution to find the man she believes was the cause of her sister's fatal unhappiness. She is very wary of men and relationships, and very protective of her cousin Keely who has recently come back into her life.<br />Keely has recently become involved with a mystery man also, and her situation begins to remind Diana of Clare's. Keely is totally unwilling to discuss the man she is in love with, or to introduce him to Diana. She begins to look strung-out after spending time with him, and then suddenly she disappears. Worried sick, and frantic to find her, Diana introduces herself to mysterious Nicholas Gale, a charismatic businessman, who she believes may be responsible for Keely's disappearance. She and Gale are drawn to each other with a force Diana does not comprehend - but Nicholas Gale understands their mutual chemistry all too well.<br />This is an unusual fantasy-paranormal romance. Gale and his twin brother Adrian, his darker half, are not vampires in the true sense of the word. They do not drink the blood of their victims, they absorb the life force they need to sustain themselves through the victims' dreams. Nicholas never hurts the women he uses, he skims their excess energy, leaving what they need to remain vital and alive. In return he gives the women the memory of extremely erotic dreams. Adrian, is not as careful and is certainly not bothered by Nicholas' \\"mortal\\" morality. He has drained the life from women and left their bodies behind without a second thought.<br />The plot-line is certainly an interesting one, and the novel could have been a winner. However the characters are stereotypes, much too predictable. Ms. Krinard gives us the classic heroine who fears relationships and needs to be with a \\"super man\\" to learn the beauty of sex and love; our hero broods in his immortal loneliness and then nobly resists love when he finds it \\"for the sake of his lover's life;\\" and the villain is a classical villain. No surprises here. Some of the dream sequences are erotic and original. But the overall narrative is similar to hundreds of others found in this genre. The story and characters both need a touch of salt or pepper - some spice to liven it up. I did enjoy reading the book to the end, but could not ignore its flaws.

Hitler publicly called Hess insane for making the flight and parachuting into enemy territory. When Hess supposedly committed suicide in his prison cell in 1987, he was Spandau's last occupant. The prison was then scheduled to be destroyed. As crowds gathered to watch the demolition of this famous building, Berlin police were assigned to maintain crown control. KGB agents diligently photographed the crowd for later identification by the East German Stasi. Among the observers was an Israeli agent. A German police captain, in charge of the contingent guarding the  rubble, unexpectedly finds mysterious papers hidden in what was Hess' cell. The papers were all written in Latin, a language he does not understand, except for the first paragraph, which is in German. The paragraph interested the police officer enough for him to bring the papers home to his wife to translate.<br />Thus begins a desperate and brutal quest by the Soviets, British, Americans, and an Israeli agent for the Spandau Diaries - a search which leaves many dead bodies in its wake. Was Rudolph Hess really Prisoner #7, or did he have a double? Did Hess have a political agenda when he parachuted into Great Britain or was he really insane? Were members of the British nobility involved in a subversive plot with Hess and Hitler?<br />This novel involves Germans, Russians, Israelis, British, Americans, South Africans, and Libyans. Iles' extraordinary tale takes the reader on a terrifying adventure into the past, which leads to the chilling realities of the present, that could very well result in worldwide nuclear war. His action scenes are so well written that they are almost visual, and certainly bring this drama to life. The main characters are complex and well defined, individually and in their relationships to each other. The ending will have you on the edge of your seat.<br />In spite of the book's unnecessary length, and a confusing narrative at the beginning, I do recommend \\"Spandau Phoenix\\" to fans of mystery-thrillers and espionage novels. Bottom line - great plot and characters overcome any flaws.<br />JANA, Russians, Israelis, British, Americans, South Africans, and Libyans.

She also creates some unique and extraordinary characters, and portrays them with depth and feeling. Her storylines are just as unusual as the characters she peoples them with. \\"Frederica\\" is no exception, and has become one of my favorite books by Ms. Heyer.<br />Frederica Merrivale travels to London with her beautiful younger sister Charis, her three younger brothers Harry, Jessamy and Felix, their way too overgrown and exuberant puppy Lufra, and their man-hating Aunt Scrabster. The Merrivale's parents are dead, and although Harry is the heir of Graynard, the Merrivale property, Frederica is the eldest sibling and the one who has assumed responsibility for running the estate and raising the family. At 24, she is bright, witty, and very attractive, although her loveliness pales beside Charis' angelic beauty. Their mother settled 5,000 pounds on each daughter for a dowry, and Frederica wants to give Charis a season in London to meet and mingle with the ton. She knows that her sister is so beautiful and unaffected that she is sure to make an outstanding match.<br />Frederica asks a very distant and unknown cousin, the Marquis of Alverstoke, to sponsor her sister's \\"coming-out\\" into society. Alverstoke is handsome, rich and spoiled. He has had many lovers, but has never had a close emotional relationship with a woman, including his sisters who constantly plague him with requests for money and favors. These women, wealthy in their own right, are unbearably overbearing and provide much comic relief. At first Alverstoke is flabbergasted by Frederica's request, and believes that she is just another female who wants something from him. Slowly and against his will, Alverstoke is charmed by the Merrivale family, and amazed at Frederica's total lack of selfishness and her efforts to raise her younger siblings. He finds a way to sponsor both Frederica and Charis and to give his sisters a \\"set down\\" at the same time.<br />Both young women are besieged by suitors after they are presented to London society. Alverstoke spends more time with all of them, especially with Frederica, as she struggles to manage the boys, her sister, her own love life, the estate in the country, and the family's future. Ms. Heyer uses her delightful humor often, especially in the dialogue between Frederica and Alverstoke, and in the scenes involving the younger brothers and their dog. All the characters are very well developed and they demonstrate growth and change throughout the novel. The Merrivale family members are quite endearing. Some exciting adventures accompany this delightful love story, set in Regency England. This is a novel you do not want to miss. Excellent!<br />JANAefforts to raise her younger siblings.

He is a gifted writer who uses his craft brilliantly. This extraordinary novel and mystery thriller is not plot-driven, although the storyline is unusually exciting and does move at a fast pace. Sanders' excellence is demonstrated through the fleshed-out, realistic characters he creates. He allows the reader to gain access to the most personal aspects of his two main characters, their thoughts, obsessions and behavior. Police Captain Edward X. Delaney, Commanding Officer of New York City's 251st Precinct, and Daniel Blank, a young business executive, a mountain climber, who has an extreme penchant for order, and strange sexual fantasies, are the primary focus of this unique mystery. The case deals with solving a series of bizarre murders, and understanding the intimacy that exists between the killer and his victim; between the detective and his suspect. Sanders takes his time developing these characters, along with the many interesting secondary figures necessary to the novel, but he does not slow the plot or sacrifice it in any way with his study of these two men.<br />Captain Delaney takes a leave of absence to care for his hospitalized wife of 30-plus years. During his leave, a murder is committed. One fall night, while Delaney is waiting for his wife's operation to conclude, a Brooklyn councilman is murdered most savagely in the middle of the 251st Precinct. Delaney goes to the murder scene to investigate; detective work is his real passion. He soon becomes entwined in vicious local politics and a major power play for control of the City. The Police Commissioner wants Delaney to conduct a secret investigation of the murder, while he is on leave. The Mayor is backing the assignment. As soon as Delaney accepts the offer, another senseless and violent murder is committed, with all signs pointing to the same killer. And he keeps killing. One of his victims is a cop. Pressure is on and Delaney is at his best under pressure. Tension builds as Delaney discovers the killer's identity, but has insufficient legal evidence to bring him in, or even to request a search warrant of the man's apartment.<br />I could not put this book down. I will say that it is a long and involved novel, which I always enjoy, especially when the writing is so good. Others, however, may prefer a thriller that moves at a faster pace and cuts to the chase quickly. Lawrence Sanders is not a writer that these readers would appreciate. I am sorry I have come upon his work so late - but in this case the old adage proves true - \\"Better late than never!\\" I highly recommend this book & happily give it 5 Stars.

Judith's qualities of intelligence, ingenuity, courage, inner strength, her loving, kind heart and unselfish nature make her truly admirable. Judith, however, is far from perfect. She has her flaws, as all people do. And these flaws, along with her many excellent traits, form a very believable young woman. I wish I could say that Ms. Deveraux is consistent in her character development, but she is not. The characters of her hero, Gavin Montgomery, and his lover, Alice Valence, are so flat they are almost caricatures. I found that these distorted, comic-book-like figures, intruded and impeded my enjoyment of the novel.<br />Wealthy heiress, Judith Revedoune, is forced by her brutal and abusive father to agree to marry Gavin Montgomery. Judith was raised to enter a convent and become a prioress; ruling lands, estates, villages, and knights. Her two elder brothers have recently died, and now she is the only heir. Her father desperately wants grandsons and the continuation of his bloodline. The Montgomery family is an old and noble one, dating back to the Norman conquest. The Montgomery brothers, led by Gavin, also offer protection from the Scots for the Revedoune borderlands.<br />Gavin Montgomery, at first glance, would seem all that a maid could ask for in a mate. Yes, he is a handsome hunk - aren't they all? He is intelligent, in the I.Q., &quot;left side of the brain&quot; sense of the word, knightly, of noble birth, bearing, and sensibilities, and has assumed responsibility for his entire family since his parents' deaths when he was sixteen years old. He is also wildly infatuated with the obviously sociopathic Alice Valence, and has been her lover, and blind to her fatal faults, for two years when the story begins. He believes that Alice was a virgin when they were first &quot;together.&quot; Meanwhile, she had been sleeping around since her early teens. (Sorry for the cattiness - I got carried away by our hero's stupidity!). Anyway, Gavin is truly, madly, deeply, etc. He has proposed marriage many, many times and Alice has always put him off with excuses - which he always accepted. She desires social position and wealth, which Gavin does not have, but she also wants Gavin's undying and exclusive devotion. She finally tells him that her father has insisted she marry a wealthy earl, and persuades him not to go to her father and pay a handsome bride price for his own suite. No one, except a green boy would believe this nonsense, without the slightest suspicion. What we have here is a naive hero, with tunnel vision, who is a poor judge of character, and stubborn to the extreme.<br />Alice is a woman so obviously evil, and demented, that even though the Montgomery brothers warn Gavin about her, he remains oblivious. Alice is another cardboard character, whose flatness really unbalances the entire novel. The author has portrayed her without any redeeming characteristics whatsoever. There is no real background material to explain why she has developed into such a despicable wretch.<br />Our hero and heroine meet on their wedding day. Gavin is surprised by Judith's unusual beauty, and dignified manner. She is taken by Gavin's gallant behavior, and thinks there may be hope for her marriage. Then she witnesses Gavin kissing Alice, and declaring his undying love for her, in the garden during the wedding feast. Judith has a bit of a declaration of her own. She vows to Gavin that she will never give herself to him freely. Thus, with this auspicious event, we have the main storyline - which gets tiresome, in spite of a few interesting subplots that Ms. Deveraux has devised. She does attempt to redeem Gavin at the book's conclusion, but by this time, he has become such a cartoon figure that it is difficult to blame or forgive him.<br />I am also disappointed with Jude Deveraux's portrayal of historic figures and lack of adherence to historical detail. She shallowly depicts England's King Henry VII and his Queen Elizabeth as a loving, happy couple, which history disputes. They chat and gossip together like old chums, a veritable &quot;Harry&quot; &amp; &quot;Liz.&quot; Their anachronistic behavior was extremely distracting for me. There is little detail of court intrigues and politics, so very prevalent at this time - and at all times. After reading this novel, one is left with the idea that the English court had little to do except gossip about love affairs, and petty, personal intrigues.<br />I will attempt to read book two in the series. I liked what I read of Stephen Montgomery, Gavin's brother and the main character in &quot;Highland Velvet.&quot; This was my first Jude Deveraux novel, and I must say that &quot;The Velvet Promise&quot; was a disappointment for me, and certainly not up to what I expected from this well-known author.<br />JANAppointed with Jude Deveraux's portrayal of historic figures and lack of adherence to historical detail.

This is a huge, multi-generational, \\"pick it up and you can't put it down until the last page is read\\" kind of novel - perfect for a vacation or a snowbound weekend.<br />Marius Gabriel writes a dramatic tale that spans three generations, and takes the reader from 1920s Spain, through the Spanish Civil War, WWII, Vietnam, and the early 1970s (US) culture of sex, drugs and rock 'n roll. All the action and subplots revolve around wealthy, sophisticated Mercedes Eduard, who was born in prewar Catalonia, the child of a rape victim. What follows is a riveting story of deception, love, and revenge most terrible. The historical backdrop, especially about Catalonian politics, anarchy, and the Civil War in Spain, certainly enhances the novel.<br />There are too many twists and turns in the plot to number, which make for a roller coaster ride of a read. And more than seven sins, (deadly or otherwise), are committed here. However, many of the book's characters are flatter than cardboard, and all too predictable. Joel Lennox, who kidnaps Mercedes' daughter Eden, and asks for millions of dollars in ransom, is the only character who is really fleshed out. He comes alive with his background of surviving the emotional pain of an abusive childhood, soldiering in the Vietnam War, and working his craft as an artist.<br />There are many books like this one on the shelves. I was quickly absorbed in the addictive storyline. It is a good, light read, but if you miss it, you are not missing a literary masterpiece.<br />JANA	2003-08-30

A Good First Effort By Heather Lowell	Marie Claire Lambert, a 30 year old career woman living in Washington, DC, is too busy to find a good man, let alone a good date. She is persuaded to sign-up for her friend Afton's dating service one evening, with the hope of finding a solution to this all too common problem. Walking to catch her bus, late that same night, Claire surprises a murderer. Terrified, she watches him stab his victim to death, and when she tries to flee the scene, he grabs her. She sprays him with pepper and escapes, running for her life. The murderer attempts to catch her, but fails when Claire runs into a late night club, where she falls down the stairs at the entrance and is knocked unconscious.<br />Heather Lowell's first novel is a suspenseful romance that absorbs the reader from the very beginning.  Through the plot is predictable, with only two primary characters, (and two or three secondary characters), the novel reads well, and the author shows promise. Neither the storyline nor the characters are very complex, but there is an endearing loyalty between Marie Claire and her childhood friend, Olivia. Detective Sean Richter makes a sexy, Alpha Male love interest, as he tries to protect Claire from the serial killer who is determined to make her next on his list. Although there are many, many Detective Richter types in the genre, the chemistry between the two is explosive. And the repartee between Richter and his cousin/sidekick Aidan Burke is fun and amusing.<br />I certainly wish Ms. Lowell the best of luck with her writing career. I am a big fan of her mother's, author Elizabeth Lowell. I hope Heather will continue to develop a strong and unique style of her own.<br />JANA	2003-08-30

It took me 200 pages before I became involved in the novel. I did not put it down earlier, because I must admit, objectively, that Elizabeth Bowen's writing style is elegant, and at times poetic. I was curious to learn what she wanted to say through the novel's characters and plot. However she does take forever to say something. Her dialogue is often inane, and her unnecessary descriptions slow the storyline unbearably. I am not a reader who requires a book to be plot driven, but Ms. Bowen's meanderings are excessive.<br />One of the book's reviewers, V.S. Pritchett, writes, &quot;Out of the plainest things - the drawing of a curtain - she can make something electric and urgent.&quot; I beg to disagree with Mr. Pritchett, but there is absolutely nothing electric, in this case, about a full page description of a woman drawing the curtains and looking out the window. It is downright tedious. After a long, rather innocuous conversation with her son, our heroine Stella Rodney, puts her cigarette out in the ashtray. After a pause, her son says, &quot;I suppose you'll need the wastebasket.&quot; That was the conversation's high point.<br />The story takes us to wartorn London, about midway through WWII. Stella Rodney, an attractive, intelligent woman in her 40s, is divorced with a son in the Army. Ms. Bowen portrays the tension and eeriness of a city, and its inhabitants, stressed by years of war and bombardment. Stella keeps running into a strange man, Harrison, who first introduces himself to her at her cousin's funeral. The meeting is not accidental. Apparently Harrison is working for one of England's secret services. He informs her that her lover, Robert, is an enemy spy. Harrison wants her to stop seeing Robert, and begin a relationship with him. He has fallen in love with her, somewhat quickly, and based on very little time together. I would call him obsessed, in a low-keyed manner. Stella's willingness to begin an affair with Harrison, is the price she will have to pay for protecting the man she loves from arrest. During the ensuing months, while she ponders and processes this information, she spends time with her son, goes with Robert to visit his family in their country estate, and makes a trip to Ireland to see about her son's inheritance. I suppose it is not the outcome of Stella's decision that is important, but her thoughts and feelings along the way.<br />Again, objectively, I would have to say that for some this may be a good novel. I do enjoy and appreciate subtlity, but Ms. Bowen's writing is too subtle for my taste.<br />JANAim. He has fallen in love with her, somewhat quickly, and based on very little time together.

Drafted in the summer of 1968, &quot;Nam-bound,&quot; O'Brien thought the war was &quot;wrongly conceived and poorly justified,&quot; and seriously planned to escape to Canada, or to Sweden. However, his entire history of life on the American prairie, the values instilled in him by parents and teachers, pulled him in another direction. In the end, he submitted. &quot;It was an intellectual and physical standoff, and I did not have the energy to see it to an end. I did not want to be a soldier, not even an observer to war. But neither did I want to upset a peculiar balance between the order I knew, the people I knew, and my own private world. It was not just that I valued that order. I also feared its opposite - inevitable chaos, censure, embarrassment, the end of everything that had happened in my life, the end of it all.&quot; Thus, he articulates, so well, the reasons that many of my generation, far less eloquent than he, went silently off to fight a war they did not believe in - and too many never returned.<br />As a woman from the &quot;Vietnam generation,&quot; this book was very painful to read. Yet, I cannot recommend it highly enough. I was still a girl, in so many ways, when Tim O'Brien landed in Vietnam. And he, and our peers, were still boys. I will always feel wonder at their courage - even if they did not feel particularly courageous. How did the regular guys I graduated school with, manage to shoot and be shot at? If there are any answers to my questions about what happened &quot;over there&quot; and why, this book gives me a pretty good idea. I travel into combat with the author, walk over minefields, feel the red earth of Vietnam, as he digs eternal holes to lie in at night. I also feel some of his horror, pain, disillusionment, and admire his dark humor.<br />O'Brien writes beautifully, with great sensitivity, of that terrible time. &quot;Do dreams offer lessons?

This is a most unusual historical novel, an espionage thriller of sorts, but much more. Martin Cruz Smith's hero, Harry Niles, is even more unique then the tale he tells - the story of Japan on the eve of Pearl Harbor. The perspective is Japanese, interpreted for us by a chameleon.<br />Harry Niles grew up in Japan, the son of American Baptist missionaries, zealous in their determination to bring the light of God to the Japanese. Harry's Uncle Orin, a devout alcoholic, baby-sat him as his parents wandered the country spreading the Word, with no knowledge of the Japanese language, or culture, and no desire to learn. The couple saw Harry as a \\"sort of amphibian, neither honest, nor stupid, neither adult nor innocent, neither American nor Japanese.\\" And Harry, who ran wild in the streets of Tokyo, at home in the shady underworld, dance halls, and back-room card games, learned early to survive well in this environment - and became a master of the \\"artful scam.\\" He survived Japanese school, where he was the only \\"gaijin,\\" (foreigner), forever playing the Indian to the Japanese schoolboys' cowboy...or samurai, as it were. He also learned the aesthetics of Shinto, which he was more comfortable with than his parent's Christianity; as well as Japanese ethics, their world view in general, their take on international politics, etc..<br />The narrative switches back and forth between Harry's adolescence, and his present life, in early December, 1941. He owns the \\"Happy Paris,\\" an American jazz bar, where a juke box provides the music, and his Japanese Communist lover, Michiko, selects the tunes. He is a con man with a heart of gold. Niles has more than an inkling that the Japanese are about to attack Hawaii - he is a man with many sources, and knows how to do simple addition. And 2+2 = Pearl Harbor. He needs to be on the last flight out of the country - otherwise the consequences won't be pretty. Japanese military and intelligence officials don't particularly care for him, and neither do the Americans, nor the Brits, for that matter. His last days in Japan, before the war, are filled with intrigue, suspense and murder.<br />Cruz Smith writes a tight, taut narrative, as always. He is a master at building suspense, in a real life drama that is already fraught with tension. His research is impeccable and I learned much while enjoying the read. Descriptions of a meeting of the elite Chrysanthemum Club, where Harry tells the Japanese version of the upcoming hostilities, are both hilarious and informative; as is the scene where Harry plays catch with the Japanese Giants' baseball team. One minute you're laughing, the next you're biting your nails.<br />Harry Niles is Smith's real masterpiece, however. Niles breathes life into every event and person that surround him. He is a perfect anti-hero on the surface. He is well aware of the multitude of contradictions that make-up his persona, and accepts them, even enjoys them, with a dark, sardonic humor. The scam has a whole new meaning in Harry's hands - his cons can cause war! Yet he is also a decent and kind man. Just beneath the surface, there exists the man who saved many Chinese lives in Japan's brutal rape of Nanking. And he continues to help both friends and strangers up until the novel's last page. Harry just doesn't want anyone to know. He doesn't want to be anyone's hero.<br />This is one of Martin Cruz Smith's best works.

The plot, and complex subplots, go back and forth in time and place, from the mid-1930s to the period before the invasion of Europe. Thus the scenario is set, and the novel's various characters are brought to life. These are the people who are involved in the Allies' invasion plans, and the Germans who plot to discover the top-secret information, and thwart the invasion. Many of the details and historical figures are accurately depicted, and realistically fleshed-out by Mr. Silva. Churchill, Hitler, Schellenberg, Himmler, Canaris and Eisenhower all have important roles in this action packed adventure - and their personas are fascinating.<br />Alfred Vicary is a primary character, and much of the story revolves around him. He is a brilliant professor and a noted historian, who was befriended by Churchill in 1935. At that time Churchill was warning Britain and Europe of the Nazi threat, but to no avail. The predominant political pundits of the day believed that Hitler, and Nazi Germany, were a good counterbalance to Stalin and the Soviet Union. Vicary wrote to Churchill, after hearing him lecture, to tell him that he agreed with his assessments. Churchill invited Vicary to his home, Chartwell, and they became close political confidants. In 1939 England's Prime Minister summoned Professor Vicary to his home, once again, to ask him to take a job in Military Intelligence for the duration of the war. Churchill tells the professor, \\"I need someone I can trust inside that department. It's time to put the 'intelligence' back in Military Intelligence.\\"<br />Catherine Blake, the novel's other primary figure, is half English and half German. Since her mother's death, when she was a child, Catherine was raised by her father in Germany. She is beautiful, intelligent and a sociopath. She was targeted early by German Intelligence, five years before the war, to be trained as a special secret agent - a sleeper. Her German controller knew everything about her, including traumatic events of her adolescence, and was a genius at manipulating her. He threatened her with her father's possible imprisonment, torture and death if she did not succeed in her mission. And her mission was to secretly enter Britain, adopt an English identity, live in London, and wait until she would be activated. She was expected to discover and transmit the key information of the Normandy invasion to her German masters.<br />This is a real page turner. Until the novel's conclusion, the reader is never sure who is the enemy, the secret agent - who is working for whom? Silva is an excellent writer. His fast paced narrative flows, and his characters are very well developed.

Although I never considered memorizing anything to be fun or profitable in lower school, the idea of memorizing wonderful poetry appeals today. Intrigued by the title, I picked up a copy of &quot;Committed to Memory: 100 Best Poems to Memorize.&quot; Although the idea is a worthy one, the poetry selection disappoints. I am sure that poet, and editor, John Hollander put considerable thought into which poems to include in this book. I just do not care for many of his choices.<br />I did find various old, (and dear), favorites that shine, and inspire, in an anthology such as this: William Butler Yeats &quot;The Song of the Wandering Angus,&quot; E.A. Robinson's &quot;Richard Cory,&quot; Percy Bysshe Shelly's &quot;Ozymandias,&quot; Richard Lovelace's &quot;To Althea, From Prison,&quot; Stevie Smith's &quot;Not Waving But Drowning,&quot; Oliver Wendell Holmes &quot;The Chambered Nautilus,&quot; and Elizabeth Bishop's extraordinary &quot;Sonnet.&quot;<br />I would never think of committing to memory many of the editor's other selections. They're either too long, too difficult to memorize, or just plain not to my taste. With all of Emily Dickinson's magnificent poetry, why &quot;A Narrow Fellow in the Grass?&quot; And why Robert Frost's &quot;A Mending Wall,&quot; which is a wonderful poem, but not the best for memorization purposes? Why &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; or &quot;The Song of the Mad Prince?&quot; There are, of course, selections from Shakespeare, and even The Old Testament, included. In general, there are too many better poetry anthologies around, to give more than a glance to this one - a disappointing 3 Stars.	2003-08-10

This hard cover, coffee table edition is beautifully presented.<br />The authors include: Jane Austen, Emily Dickenson, Edith Wharton, Dorothy Parker, Eudora Welty, Joyce Carol Oates, Flannery O'Conner, Edith Sitwell, Jean Rhys - the list goes on, and the selection is extraordinary.<br />Look for the expanded second edition of &quot;Women of Words.&quot; It includes 43 women writers, (more is better in this case).

I began using Frommer's travel books/guides in the 1970s, for Central and South America, and Europe. They were my favorite guide books then, and are still the best, providing clear, concise information for the traveler, with a predominately midlevel budget range. All their books, however, usually contain excellent low-budget suggestions, as well as information provided for luxury accommodations. With that endorsement, I most highly recommend &quot;Frommer's Italy.&quot; I have lived in Rome, but that was 20 years ago, and on a glorious return trip to Italy early last spring, I found the updated guide even more informative than the one I used so long ago.<br />&quot;Frommer's Italy&quot; provides a wide range of suggested accommodations, from budget to luxury, and I decided, before my trip, on a lovely pensione in Rome, which was my &quot;base of operations.&quot; I made reservations, by telephone, a month in advance and found the place, and the price, to be exactly as described, along with the excellent service. Frommer's suggested trattorias became my favorites, and the pensione owners also made some excellent suggestions. I selected my lodgings in Firenze, Venice, Naples, Milan and Palermo from Frommer's, as well, and although I clearly preferred some over others, I was comfortable at all. The information in the guide was accurate in all cases. My ideas for day trips, from each of these cities, were based on a combination of past experience, the advice of friends and Frommer's suggestions. Frommers had the best and most original information about off-the-mainstream places of interest, including festivals, fairs, markets, shopping, entertainment, nightlife, etc.<br />The fold-out country map, and city maps are extremely easy to follow. I have the world's worst sense of direction, and never got lost - even on my own, original walking tour of the winding streets of Venice.<br />All of the many magnificent things to see in Italy, each city's major attractions, the museums, churches and galleries are obviously included. It is the selection of lesser known sites, and out-of-the-way itineraries that makes this guide so special. I have read that some people find the book to be too big or bulky. I find it to be just right, and never needed to refer to another guide during my entire trip.<br />For before trip preparation, you may wish to brush-up on Italian history, art, the Renaissance - whatever your area(s) of interest. If so, you will do well to look at books specifically on the topics of your choice. Frommer's does provide a BRIEF nine pages of historical information.

Someone once asked me, if I were stranded on a desert island, and could have one book with me, which would I choose? Easy answer - \\"The Oxford Anthology of English Literature.\\" Actually, it's a two volume set - but I am designating the two volumes as one book, for desert island convenience.<br />This extraordinary 4,500 page collection contains Great Britain's finest literature from the Middle Ages through the 20th century. Included are selections from \\"Beowulf,\\" Chaucer's \\"The Canterbury Tales,\\" works by Spenser (excerpts from all books of \\"The Faerie Queene\\"), Sir Thomas Malory, Shakespeare (including \\"The Tempest'), Marlowe (\\"Dr. Faustus,\\" \\"Hero and Leander\\"), John Donne, and Milton. There are over 100 pages devoted to William Blake, including \\"The Book of Thel,\\" and the entire \\"Night the Ninth\\" from \\"The Four Zoas.\\" It also contains poems and prose by Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, and Byron. And this is just a small sample.<br />In addition to the general editors Frank Kermode and John Hollander, the anthology has been edited and annotated by Harold Bloom, Martin Price, J.B. Trapp, and Lionel Trilling. The editors contribute brief period introductions, biographical and critical pieces for major authors, and essays preceding the major selections.<br />There are almost 300 wonderful illustrations included in the collection, representing important artists and their works for each period, that demonstrate the relationship between literary and visual images.<br />I have read through this wonderful anthology many times over the years, and never fail to learn something new, something to excite my imagination, with each reading.

Florine Asch allows us to accompany her on a Grand Tour of Italy. She takes us along, at a leisurely pace, that does recall a time when travel was more about the journey than the destination. Dominique Fernandez, who writes the Introduction to &quot;My Italian Sketchbook,&quot; tells us that &quot;tourist&quot; originally meant, &quot;one who travels, not to arrive, but aimlessly, as the servant of beauty.&quot;<br />Ms. Asch's attachment to Italy is palpable in her glorious sketches, all executed in watercolor. Her elegant sketches, 100 of them, depict the known sites, and the scenes that are rarely seen by the hurried tourist. She captures a sunset view of Saint Peter's in Rome, the beauty of Lake Como, a Tuscan landscape, the medieval majesty of Sienna, the Renaissance glory of Firenze, the Duomo in Milan, a studio filled with Greek plaster figures, a horse and buggy by Rome's Trevi Fountain, the carnival in Venice, street scenes in Naples, a Sicilian piazza, and marketplace.<br />Florine Asch uniquely portrays the ordinary and extraordinary vistas, and views, of Italy. My tourist photographs never looked like this. A wonderful book to keep as a remembrance, or to give as a gift. Anyone who loves all things Italian, will love this book. I certainly do!	2003-08-07

Paula Huntley left her home in California, and traveled with her husband, Ed, to Kosovo in 2000, one year after the NATO bombing of that province. Ed Huntley desperately wanted to do something to help in the war-torn Balkans. So he volunteered for an American Bar Association project to help rebuild Kosovo's legal system. Paula trained to teach English as a second language, (TESL), while she was still in the States. \\"The Hemingway Book Club Of Kosovo\\" is her memoir of that period, taken from the journal she kept during the eight months they lived and worked in Prishtina. Ms. Huntley movingly writes of her experience, and of the intimate bond she forged with her students.<br />The Huntleys arrived in Prishtina and found that the city had not been totally destroyed. Since the Serbs needed Prishtina, the capital city, they had left most of the buildings intact. However, as in most of Kosovo, there had been massive looting, vandalism and violence, murders were committed on a large scale, as was ethnic cleansing of the Kosovo Albanians. Huntley writes, \\"Most of the destruction in Prishtina was below the surface - in the hearts and minds of the residents. I saw this every day, and I never got used to that destruction.\\"<br />Her students, and every native Albanian, had lost ten years of their lives under the brutal oppression, and apartheid imposed by the Kosovo Serbs. Learning English, in many ways, was key to the economic advancement of the students and their families. Ms. Huntley was deeply touched by the students' eagerness to learn not just English, and grammatical structure, but about the American culture and work ethic. She wanted to provide a safe forum for them to discuss their feelings, and the traumas of the past decade. A book club was established, that met at the Huntley home. The selection was Ernest Hemmingway's \\"The Old Man And The Sea.\\" The club took-off and became so much more. And the book became a vehicle through which the young people could discuss their lives. Hemmingway's book was fairly easy for them to read, but the novel's meaning was far deeper than the relatively simple language. The students identified with the fable of the triumph of hope and courage over adversity.<br />The harrowing stories of the young Albanians, and their courage, and determination, are remarkable, and inspirational. Paula Huntley's memoir is an extraordinary tale of cross-cultural human connections, and bonds forged through literature and loving kindness. Highly recommended!ir lives.

Fay Weldon gives new meaning to irony in \\"The Hearts And Lives Of Men.\\" This is a satiric love story, peopled with some of the most original characters I have met in years. Weldon gets right to the guts of the love-hate contradiction, that exists in all of us, and turns it into grand comedy, and sometimes, grand guignol. She also parodies the art world, and the lives of the rich, famous, and talented, as well as a few plain ordinary folks, back in the 1960s, \\"when everybody wanted everything, and thought they could have it, and what's more had a right to it!\\" It was a time when it was possible to have, \\"Sex without babies. Revolution without poverty. Careers without selfishness. Art without effort.\\" Her writing is elegant, and her wit, delightfully malicious. She takes her readers into her intimate confidence. We become her Dear Readers, and priveleged to travel with her into the realm of her insights, and very wicked they are.<br />\\"This is the story of Clifford, Helen and little Nell.\\" We are once upon a time, in London, in the glorious mid-1960s. Clifford, a wealthy, up and coming art aficionado, who is soon to give Sotheby's a run for their money with his establishment, Leonardo's, and Helen, the much younger, lovely daughter of an eccentric, impoverished artist, fall in love at first sight. They gaze across a crowded room into each other's eyes, (just like in the song), and immediately know that fate has touched them. Nell is conceived that night. And, as with most fairy tales, and sadly with life also, all is not happily ever after.<br />Clifford and Helen fight as passionately as they love. He is too often busy at work, buying, appraising, and selling art to spend much time with his new wife and daughter. \\"Telling the good from the bad is what the Art World is all about, and a sizable chunk of the world's resources is devoted to just this end.\\" And Clifford wants part of that chunk. A very wicked witch enters the picture, at about this time. Actually she was there from the beginning, in the person of Angie, Clifford's super wealthy, scheming, ex-fiancee. The new husband was just too busy to pay much attention to Angie's vicious mischief-making before. And mischief-make she does. Helen and Clifford divorce as a result, and in the nastiness that accompanies such dissolution of relationships, little Nell becomes lost to both of her parents.<br />Nell, miraculously survives a kidnapping, plane crash, various foster parents and many harrowing adventures. Her parents grieve, blame each other for their loss, and move on with their lives. They must live many years, and learn much in that time -enough to deserve Nell. And then she will return to them.<br />In this adult fable, true love will finally triumph over hate, lust and greed. Good will ultimately prevail. It is the process of reaching the story's finale that makes this tale so fascinating and funny. The characters will change, grow and mature. And those few who do not, will find their just reward.

Anyone who loves the the world's great bodies of water will be awed by Philip Plisson's stunning seascapes. He has captured the oceans in all moods, in all their glory - gentle, tempestuous, mysterious, terrifying, powerful. There is the beautiful tranquility of the Caribbean, and the stormy violence of the North Atlantic. And Plisson also captures the elusive quality of light, and the way it falls on water. His successful efforts to capture the right light, at the best moment, to enhance the particular quality of the sea he wants to exhibit, is worth the price of the book alone.<br />Many of his remarkable images feature lighthouses, ancient tall ships, and modern sail boats, regattas, and sailors alone with the elements. The vast sea, however, is the dominant presence in all the photographs.<br />There is very little text here. The monumental photographs speak for themselves. Yann Queffelec's Introduction does provide a perfect setting, and Elaine Georges' text is well written.<br />I bought this huge, (11.5&quot; X 14.5&quot;), coffee-table book for a sailing mate's birthday, and he absolutely loves it.

I am a longtime Julie Garwood fan, and never thought I would see the day when I would give one of her books a 1 Star rating. The day has come! I couldn't get past page 160, in \\"Killjoy,\\" before I had to put the novel down. I am talking about 160 pages of the most boring prose I have ever read. I loved all Ms. Garwood's historical romances. I just don't think she has written anything original, worthwhile, or interesting since she began writing \\"contemporary romantic suspense fiction,\\" (crsf).<br />I read \\"Heartbreaker\\" when it first came out, and while not one of the best \\"crsf\\" books on the already glutted market, I did finish it, and even enjoyed some parts. I thought, this is a new effort for the author, and she will surely improve and attain her previous heights as a romance writer. I was disappointed with \\"Mercy.\\" Certainly not much improvement there. I did purchase \\"Killjoy,\\" because my loyal fan status dies hard, and I was ever the optimist.<br />The characters in Killjoy are cardboard caricatures, not believable at all. The heroine, Avery Delaney is just too naive - too cutesy, to be as intelligent, creative, and brave as she is supposed to be. How did this woman ever get a job as a crime analyst with the FBI? Her mother, Jilly, the Bad Seed, is like a villain from a comic book - no redeeming traits. She isn't even gifted with the sly intelligence sometimes present in psychopaths. The hero is flatter than two day-old seltzer. Yes, he's handsome, (according to Ms. Garwood), but has little else going for him. The plot is trite. There is nothing new here. The evil ones are not even scary! And the dialogue, especially between hero and heroine, is inane, to say the least.<br />I think this is the last time I will spend my money on a Julie Garwood book, at least not while she is in a slump. It's a shame! I write this review with no great satisfaction. I only hope to save fellow customers some time and money.	2003-08-05

I understand that many of this book's characters are from their earlier novels, but this character revival does not disturb the narrative's flow at all. All necessary background is explained well, and gives depth to the relationships and plotline. My one complaint about this novel is that it is at least 100 pages too long. The authors build suspense to a fever pitch, the tension peaks, begins to fall-off, and their point is still not made, nor are the various mysteries solved. There are also two endings. One is not very satisfying, and the other, much better conclusion, is found in the epilogue. The lack of tightness in the narrative, makes the novel weaker than it would have been with better editing. That said, this is a real thriller, and scary/chilling to boot - the way Stephen King's early novels are scary.<br />During the excavation for the construction of a sixty-five story residential tower in lower Manhattan, a charnel house of murder victims is discovered. The 36 victims were destitute youths, residing along the crime-ridden waterfront of 1870s New York City. They were buried beneath what was then known as Shottum's Cabinet. Cabinets of curiosities housed strange & diverse collections of artifacts, and were the precursors to the natural history museum.<br />FBI Special Agent Pendergast enters the story to investigate this most heinous of American serial murders. He calls upon Dr. Nora Kelly, archeologist, conservator and researcher at New York's Museum of Natural History, for assistance in his investigation. Dr. Kelly, in turn involves her fiance, New York Times investigative reporter William Smithback. Together they discover the eerie background of the murders. Just after Smithback's indiscreet article appears on his newspaper's front page, new murder victims begin to appear. The modus operendi is the same. The major difference is that the original victims were killed in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The new victims were murdered at the beginning of the twenty-first, seemingly by the same killer. Is this a copycat crime, or something much more disturbing?<br />I was on the edge of my seat throughout this novel - just couldn't put it down. The historical detail is a wonderful addition. I would have rated the book five stars, except for the annoying flaws mentioned above.

Tolkien. I have read \\"The Hobbit\\" at least four times in the thirty-five years since I first discovered it, and have never ceased to be thrilled by Bilbo Baggins and his brave cohorts. Their quest to destroy the evil dragon Smaug, recover stolen gold, deliver the enslaved people of Lake Town, and the strong bond of friendship they forge along the way, has thrilled millions of readers. Although \\"The Hobbit\\" is a prequel, of sorts, to the \\"Lord Of The Rings Trilogy,\\" it stands on its own as a wonderful tale of magical fantasy, and as a story of personal courage and growth.<br />\\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs.\\" Tolkein's description of the Hobbit's home is important to form an understanding of Bilbo Baggins' character. Mr Baggins is the particular Hobbit of note, for whom the book is titled. He likes nothing more than comfort, and dislikes nothing more than change. What is a hobbit, you ask? Hobbits are \\"a race of small, plump people about half the size of humans, with furry toes and a great love of good food and drink.\\" Unfortunately they no longer live on Earth.<br />Bilbo, who leads a very comfortable life at his home, Bag End, near the bustling village of Hobbiton, is rudely interrupted one day by a wise old wizard, Gandolf the Gray. Gandolf, with a great deal of pressure, persuades Bilbo to set out with thirteen angry, and determined dwarves, to reclaim their stolen treasure from a terrible dragon. The Hobbit, who has never stolen anything in his life, nor would he think to do so, is proclaimed \\"The Burglar.\\" And the skeptical dwarves are reassured by Gandolf that \\"there is more to Bilbo than meets the eye.\\"<br />The troop ventures off, through various mysterious, mystical lands that no longer exist on Earth - Rivendell, the elves stronghold, the Misty Mountains, Mirkwood Forest, Lake Town and the Lonely Mountains. They meet and befriend numerous memorable characters along the way, and encounter fiendish enemies also. It is on this journey that Bilbo finds the all powerful golden ring, that plays such an important role in Tolkein's masterful epic the \\"Lord Of The Ring Trilogy.\\"<br />Before Bilbo can return to the comfort and security of Bag End, he will fight many battles, change lives, influence the future, and undergo changes himself. The drama, suspense and sheer beauty of Tolkien's tale will captivate you. It is truly an unforgettable story, written in a most unique literary style, by a man who has created and peopled an entire world, and given its inhabitants a new language. Brilliant!sure from a terrible dragon.

Fortunately I began Jodi Picoult's \\"Keeping Faith\\" on a weekend, because I couldn't put it down. Thanks to my daughter, who provided me with nutritional sustenance while I turned the pages, I was able to read the book straight through at one sitting. I have read all Ms. Picoult's novels, and this is her best so far.<br />Mariah White, and her seven year-old daughter Faith, come home unexpectedly one afternoon, and surprise Colin White, husband and father, with his lover. Divorce proceedings ensue. Faith, understandably, is traumatized by what she saw and doesn't understand, and by the sudden separation of her parents. She finds comfort in an invisible friend, her \\"guard,\\" a seemingly benign female figure who calms her, and answers her painful questions.<br />When Faith's beloved grandmother has a fatal heart attack, Faith brings her back to life by breathing into her mouth. Then she cures a baby dying of AIDS. It seems that her \\"guard\\" is God, and a female to boot. Faith has been brought up in a home where no religion is practiced. Her mother is a nonobservant Jewess, and her father, a non-practicing Episcopalian. She has never read the Bible or been taught to pray. Doctors convey that the resurrection of Faith's grandmother, and the healed infant, appear to be almost miraculous recoveries. There is no logical, medical explanation for their sudden improvement. A child psychiatrist, who examines Faith, is certain that the little girl is not psychotic, or making believe. Then Faith manifests stigmata.<br />Out of nowhere, crazies rain down upon the house of Faith White, seeking to be cured, seeking to cure their curiosity, looking for a Big story, hoping to reach God by praying there, etc.. And Faith's and Mariah's lives are forever changed.<br />Colin, alarmed for his daughter's welfare, blames Faith's visitation on his wife's past emotional instability, and seeks to gain sole custody of his daughter. A big name talk show host, Ian Fletcher, famous for his outspoken atheism, targets Faith and Mariah, bent on proving them fakes...with surprising results.<br />The story builds in complexity and suspense. The characters grow and change, as do their relationships. The issues here are more about ethics than about God and religion. Jodi Picoult has proven to be a talented writer.

Her wit and wonderful characters are always winners in my book! I think Ms. Isaacs was at her best with &quot;Compromising Positions,&quot; and &quot;Almost Paradise.&quot; So I was happy to pick up a copy of &quot;Long Time No See,&quot; which reintroduces her readers to Judith Singer, from &quot;Compromising Positions,&quot; twenty years after the original intro. Apart from my eagerness to read this new novel, and to find out how Judith has fared, I looked forward to discover how Judith has aged, being a contemporary of hers, and to see if we still have things in common. ;)<br />Judith, now a widow for two years, has earned her doctorate in history and teaches at a local upscale college. She has mourned her husband, who though not the love of her life, was a much loved companion. She hasn't seen the love of her life, Homicide Detective Nelson Sharpe for twenty years. At their last meeting they made a mutual vow never to meet again. Nelson, however, lurks in Judith's mind, never far from her thoughts.<br />The now Dr. Singer has never lost the &quot;detective bug&quot; either, which she picked up in &quot;Compromising Positions.&quot; When a local mother of two, Courtney Logan, suddenly disappears, the mystery peaks her interest. When Courtney's body is found, weeks later, in the family's covered pool, Judith's long suppressed detective instincts, chomp at the bit! Desperate for accurate information about the homicide, Judith actually knocks at the Logan's door and questions the uncommunicative, grieving husband, Greg Logan. What chutzpah! Logan's father, the renowned, very gauche, and dangerous gangster, Philip &quot;Fancy Phil&quot; Lowenstein, hears about Judith's visit, and pays her a visit himself. Yoiks! Actually, Lowenstein hires our &quot;would-be sleuth&quot; informally, to see what she can discover. The Nassau Police believe that his son Greg is the murderer, and have not made much of an effort to find another perp. &quot;Fancy Phil&quot; remembers Judith's effectiveness from &quot;Compromising Position&quot; days and hopes she will come up with some helpful clues...or maybe an answer to &quot;who done it.&quot;<br />The mystery is a good one with some surprises. Romantic sparks fly with the reappearance of Nelson Sharpe. And Ms. Isaacs' wit is as sharp as ever. There is nothing deep here; no gripping suspense, nor complex characters or plot. &quot;Long Time No See&quot; is a fun and entertaining read, however.

Daniel Silva brings back his enigmatic hero, Gabriel Allon, in \\"The Confessor,\\" to investigate the mysterious murder of a dear friend, the unpopular aspirations of a newly elected Pope, a secret society in the Vatican, and long hidden secrets from World War II. Allon, is a brilliant Israeli art restorer and a complex, melancholy man. He had worked for many years as an Israeli intelligence agent, and assassin, (when necessary), losing his young son and wife to violence as a consequence of his work. Now he just wants to restore paintings and be left alone with his grief and his guilt.<br />Allon's boyhood friend and associate, Benjamin Stern, is murdered in his Munich apartment while writing a secret expose on Pope Pius XII and the Church's involvement in the Holocaust. Ari Shamron, Gabriel's old mentor, former head of Israeli intelligence, and the father of Ben Stern, finds Allon in Venice, restoring a Bellini altarpiece. He has little difficulty persuading Allon to accept this assignment to find Stern's killer, even though it means leaving the Bellini, at least temporarily.<br />Although Allon runs into a stone wall with his investigation in Munich, he begins to discover clues to the secrets of his friend's manuscript. Apparently Stern had been writing about material from top secret Vatican archives that proves Pope Pius XII, and the Church, were directly involved with the Nazis in the implementation of the Holocaust. Evidence also points to a deadly secret Vatican society, the Crux Vera.<br />Pope Paul VII, known by his Vatican detractors as \\"Pope Accidental,\\" has recently been elected to the Papal Throne. He has pledged to review the Church's alleged complicity in the Nazi extermination of the Jews, and make available the Secret Vatican Archives regarding the Holocaust - archives that certain Vatican officials would do anything to keep suppressed. Allon's life, and the Pope's, are in terrible jeopardy.<br />Whatever your opinion on these controversial issues, Daniel Silva has written his best novel with this mesmerizing tale of Vatican politics, intrigue, murder and World War II history. Mr. Silva's style is reminiscent, but not derivative, of Ken Follett, Frederick Forsyth and John LeCarre. He is definitely in their league and oh, so original, with his 21st century relevant storyline. I have waited for a long time for an author of this caliber to appear and keep me on the edge of my seat, reading through the night. I was unable to put this book down.iel Silva has written his best novel with this mesmerizing tale of Vatican politics, intrigue, murder and World War II history.

He is an intelligent, well educated man, who used to be respected in Iran as a person of position, power, and means. Behrani's former life, with all his efforts to build it, seems like it was constructed on a sea of shifting sand. He came to America with his wife, son, and daughter four years ago, with limited funds, and has spent almost all of his money setting his family up in the manner to which they had been accustomed. Appearances mean much to Behrani. His dream of attracting a wealthy, eligible suitor for his daughter by living above his meager means, has been realized. His daughter is finally married, and established in her own home. After extensive job searches, he is reduced to working as a trash collector on the California highways with other immigrants; men he would have given alms to in his native land. Angry and humiliated at how far he has fallen, Behrani decides to invest his remaining funds in a house that has been put up for auction at a Sheriff's Sale, because the owner had not paid back property taxes. He wants to restore the house and sell it at a large profit, which he hopes will enable him to provide his family with their former lifestyle, and restore some of his lost dignity.<br /><br />Kathy Nicolo is a depressed, quietly self-destructive woman; a recovering alcoholic and addict. Describing the success of her recovery program, Kathy says, \\"I had already stopped wanting what I'd been craving off and on since I was fifteen, for Death to come take me the way the wind does a dried leaf out on its limb.\\" Her house, in the California hills, is all she has. It is a symbol of stability, and a reminder of a gentler past. She is adamant in her refusal to give-up her home because of a bureaucratic error.<br /><br />Sheriff Lester Burdon bears terrible news when he delivers the eviction papers to Kathy. She confides in him, and he becomes obsessed with helping her fight for justice. Lester finds himself falling deeply in love with Kathy, although he is married and has addiction problems, and much personal baggage, of his own.<br /><br />The contested ownership of the house on Bisgrove Street is the fulcrum of this intense novel's plot.

I have heard so much praise about his other novels, that when I saw this book on a friend's bookshelf, I asked to borrow it. My expectations dropped quickly as I began to read. The novel starts somewhat slowly and the pace declines with each page. Instead of focusing on the strange, (just plain weird!), new woman who enters John Waters' life, (he's our hero), Mr. Iles bogs the reader down with the myriad problems Waters is having with his business, marriage, his best friend and partner, etc.. All this initial information, which is admittedly essential, could have been woven into the storyline later, and tends to defuse the tension needed to develop suspense in this supernatural (not so thrilling) thriller.<br />John Waters is a petroleum geologist, and is co-owner of a successful business in Natchez, Mississippi. He and his wife Lily, along with their precocious 7 year-old daughter, Anneliese, live in a beautiful antebellum home in the suburbs of Natchez. The marriage had been a happy one, until Lily miscarried twice. The premature end to these pregnancies, along with the death of her father, sent Lily spiraling into depression. Although Lily is fully recovered when the novel begins, she and John have not experienced sexual intimacy for four years. This has placed a tremendous burden on the otherwise happy relationship, but John has remained faithful to his wife.<br />Then Eve Sumner, a beautiful, dark-haired real estate agent, who \\"gets around,\\" suddenly enters John's life, and aggressively insists on meeting with him alone. She convinces Waters, with considerable effort, that she is really Mallory Candler, his first love, who was murdered ten years before. She is living in the body of Eve Sumner, and has taken over Sumner's personality completely. Apparently, through a series of bizarre soul transfers, beginning at the moment of her death, Mallory has occupied several bodies, intent on making her way back to John, the man she still loves...and also hates. Well, she has returned and wants him back NOW! John finds his long sought sexual release with Mallory/Evie, and sex is everything it always had been with her - kinky and unbelievably erotic! He becomes totally obsessed with her for a few weeks. When he realizes that he is risking the loss of his family, he tries to get out of the relationship, and serious trouble begins<br />Mr. Iles is a good writer, and he adds murder, mystery, deception, violence, infidelity, kinky sex, alcoholism, gambling, bad business deals, and an EPA investigation, to his tale of transferred souls. One would think this would be a real page-turner. But the novel fails somewhere along the way. Perhaps the narrative is too plot driven, and the characters too flat. I don't find them to be believable - although I have no problem getting into the supernatural. I did finish the book, but it was a tedious read. I gave it 3 stars, rather than 2, because of Mr. Iles' writing style, and because the plot's premise is interesting.

Jane Austin is one of my favorite authors. I think that \\"Persuasion\\" is her best novel, with both \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride And Prejudice\\" tied for second place. \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is an absolutely wonderful book, capturing beautifully the English Regency period's mores, manners, and lifestyles. The central theme deals with the extreme differences in temperaments between two sisters, and the eventual reconciliation and moderation of both their characters and temperaments.<br />Marianne Dashwood is a passionate young woman, with a definite inclination toward the humanities: art, music and literature. Her heart rules her head, more often than not, and she has a very spontaneous nature. Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters, is much more practical and sensible. While Elinor appreciates the music and literature that her sibling so passionately loves, she definitely thinks things through before making decisions, or taking action, and keeps her personal feelings to herself. She feels tremendous responsibility for her family's well-being. Elinor does have a wonderful, dry sense of humor, and her witty comments enhance the novel. Throughout most of the narrative, Marianne believes that Elinor, whom she dearly loves, is too cold, and restrained - more concerned with propriety than with feelings. She is obviously judgmental concerning Elinor's reticence to freely express her emotions, and she also pities Elinor, for her perceived inadequacies. Elinor, on the other hand, is concerned about Marianne's open and guileless behavior. She fears her sister will be hurt by indulging in her strong emotions, and that conventional society will condemn her for this attribute.<br />The story opens with the death of Elinor and Marianne's father. He, unavoidably, has left them, along with their mother, (his second wife), and younger sister with little money. They are forced to leave their home, the Norland estate, and move to Barton Cottage, close to a distant relative's estate. Norland and all its treasures have been left to Dashwood's son, by his first wife. The four women have been left on their own, to pursue life, love, and loss in their different manners. <br />Both Elinor and Marianne fall deeply in love, while at Barton, and each, in turn, are disappointed by their choices. These devastating losses, plus their adjustments to an entirely different lifestyle, serve to modify their temperaments and change their lives.<br />\\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is a deeply moving novel, with biting satire, especially demonstrated in the characters of Fanny and John Dashwood, and Lucy Steele; and of course Elinor's fine wit adds much to make the reader smile. Ms. Austin's writing is pure elegance. Her female characters are well developed, including those in minor roles. The men, particularly John Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon are very different in nature, and not at all stereotypical. I loved the scenes at Barton Cottage with Marianne and Willoughby, and with Willoughby and the Dashwood family. I also really enjoyed the visit to London and the tragic ball scene.<br />I found myself laughing and crying while reading this book. So with all the discussion about moderation and passion, Jane Austin, once again, brought out the gamut of emotions in me. I cannot recommend this delightful novel highly enough!s estate.

The Project's first anthology, &quot;Americans' Favorite Poems,&quot; consists of 200 of the submitted poems, along with readers' comments about their attachments to the poems. The selections are by poets from all over the world, poems written centuries ago alongside contemporary poems, poignantly sad poetry, as well as spiritually uplifting works, and humorous poems.

The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan began on Christmas Eve 1979. The inhabitants of this geographically isolated land, rose up to defend their country. They armed themselves with whatever was on hand, gathered into loose formations and began to attack and sabotage the Soviet Union's personnel, installations, depots and transports with any available weapons. Scattered guerrilla bands, with fierce pride, and a tremendous ability to endure, fought against the far superior and more numerous Soviet forces and sophisticated weaponry.<br />\\"Lie Down With Lions\\" opens in Paris in 1981. John Ellis, an American CIA agent, is working undercover and living with a politically active Englishwoman, the sensual, lovely Jane Lambert, who he plans on proposing marriage to as soon as he completes his assignment. Jean-Pierre Debout, a French doctor and member of the Communist Party, is going to Afghanistan, ostensibly to provide medical assistance to the rebel forces fighting against the Soviets. He has, however, another agenda. Jean-Pierre also loves Jane and wants her to accompany him to Afghanistan as his nurse-assistant. Ellis, after capturing an important KGB agent, is exposed as CIA. Jane leaves him in disgust, not only because of his job, but because he lied to her.<br />The Valley of Five Lions, a place of ancient legend, lies deep in the Afghan mountains, far removed from civilization. Jane and her husband, Jean Pierre have been working here, in a rebel village, for a year. They minister to the local inhabitants, who have never seen a doctor before, and patch together and stitch-up the wounded warriors. An American visits the valley with an important message for Masud, a famous and effective guerrilla leader, from the White House. The messenger is John Ellis. A terrible treachery is discovered, shortly after he arrives. A nightmare flight with the Soviets in pursuit occurs, across the Hindu Kush, leading to an extraordinarily suspenseful confrontation.

I am a big Linda Howard fan, but this book is definitely not one of her best efforts.  A first time reader might find it hard to believe, with this novel as an example, that Ms. Howard has written many excellent romance thrillers in the past. She could have done so much more with her unusual heroine, Sarah Stevens, who has a career as a butler. I don't think she used this unique vehicle to enhance her story, or her character. It is a shame - the idea of a woman butler is an excellent one.<br />Sarah has been both butler and bodyguard to an elderly gentleman, a retired judge, for three years when the story opens. They have a wonderful relationship, and she is extremely fond of him. The judge's home is burgled one night, and Sarah catches the two thieves before they escape - with her karate chops & kicks. BAM! Wham! Gotcha - me, women, against two guys! Although she is a top marksman, she fortunately does not use her gun to stop the robbers. Sarah is a stereotypical tough gal, who spends much of her time honing her bodyguard skills, but she is also sensitive woman with a tender heart - and beautiful to boot! What else? Couldn't get less complex than that. But wait! The handsome, macho-man detective, who comes to investigate the robbery, is less complex than that. Embittered by a bad marriage and subsequent divorce, he doesn't care for women very much, except as one night stands. He is attracted to Sarah, however. And surprise(!), she is attracted back. So the novel goes. Nothing new, exciting, or suspenseful here.<br />Anyway, the media is alerted by the thwarted crime. A local TV news producer comes up with the idea of an interesting feature spot starring the female butler. Sarah is interviewed, and a pathological murderer, watching the tube at the time, becomes obsessed with her. He will do anything to have her butler for him. And he does.<br />The characters in \\"Dying To Please\\" are so shallow and flat, they could almost be cartoons. The dull narrative lacks Ms. Howard's usual flair, and there is little intelligent dialogue between Sarah and Cahill, (the detective). They mostly bicker, or he bosses her around. They do have terrific sex - but this has always been a Linda Howard strong point. However, it is difficult to appreciate the eroticism, if the participating characters are not vivid and lifelike. All in all, this book is a disappointment. I highly recommend many other of the author's novels, but not this one.

Women in Regency England had few options in life except to marry well. They usually received little, if any, formal education, and their aim was to become \\"accomplished,\\" proficient in the social graces like music, needlework, sketching, whist and &quot;acceptable&quot; literature. Considerable pressure was placed on women to marry in order to obtain financial security, not just for themselves, but also for their immediate family. Love matches were rare. Ms. Austin writes, &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" So there you have it. The men and women of the Regency period, nobility and emerging middle class alike, were very focused on the business of marriage.<br />Our story opens in the small community of Longbourn, Hertfordshire. Word is out that the empty Netherfield Estate has been leased to a new occupant - a wealthy bachelor. Mothers and daughters suddenly upset their daily routine, and shatter the local tranquility - buying dress material, sewing, embroidering, planning and fantasizing about balls and marriage. Nowhere is there more excitement than at the Bennett home, where five very marriageable daughters anticipate news of their neighbor. The Bennett's have a particular reason for wishing their girls settled. The Bennett estate, Longbourn, is entailed. It can only be inherited by a male successor. Since the Bennett's have no son, their entire estate will go to Mr. Bennett's cousin. The girls must be married well, so they will have a secure home when their father dies. If their mother should outlive her spouse, they will have to provide for her also.<br />There is a ball in honor of John Bingley, the new resident at Netherfield, and for the friends who accompany him. Bingley is very taken with Jane Bennett, the eldest daughter, and a lovely young woman with a sweet disposition. The feelings are reciprocated and the two form an attachment. It is at this ball that Elizabeth Bennett, the family's second daughter, meets Bingley's friend, the aristocratic Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy, is much richer than Bingley. He is a handsome, intelligent man, and the Lord of Pemberly, a large, sumptuous estate in Derbyshire. Darcy, however, is the epitome of haughtiness when he arrives on the scene, and looks down his nose at the local yokels. Elizabeth Bennett, is quite different from most young women of the Regency Period. She had been encouraged to use and develop her strong intellect since childhood, and she has become quite literate, and enjoys fine books and literary conversation. She is bright, with a sharp wit, much more independent than her sisters, and very pretty. Darcy is attracted to her immediately, but snubs her unknowingly. She responds in kind, thinking him to be boorish and far too proud. Thus she is prejudiced against him from their first meeting.<br />The novel is filled with Ms. Austin's humor and delightful characters, including: George Wickham, a handsome military officer who further prejudices Elizabeth against Darcy with tales from their mutual past; William Collins, a pompous clergyman, cousin to the Bennets, and probable heir to the family holdings; Charlotte Lucas, a young neighbor and dear friend to Elizabeth and Jane; and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, the quintessential aristocrat. Jane Austen weaves her plots and sub-plots with elegant prose and wit. Her clever use of irony, reveals her characters' charms and flaws. At one point, Mr. Darcy actually insists that Elizabeth is the proud one. It is pure pleasure to read her narrative and dialogue. And the characters are so believable that is difficult to remain disinterested in their lives and foibles.<br />Mr Darcy learns more about Elizabeth with each chapter. He discovers her wit, intelligence and charm. She almost always spurns his awkward attempts to woo her. When she finally admits to herself how much she admires Darcy, he puts his foot in his mouth. He tries to tell Elizabethof his deep feelings for her. However, he explains that his strong emotions go against his social background. He is prepared to marry someone of lower status, prepared to suffer hostility from his relations, and society in general, in order to be with her. All of this, sounds condescending to Elizabeth, and he infuriates her. It is as if Darcy is doing her a favor by loving her. He also tells her, honestly, that he has sabotaged the relationship between her sister Jane and his friend Bingley, because he fears Jane wants to marry Bungley for his money. So, once again, Elizabeth rejects him because of his pride.<br />If the young couple would be able to understand and let go of their shallow pride and prejudice, a wonderful love and friendship could form and flourish. Elizabeth also exhibits her prejudice against her close friend, Charlotte, when she marries for convenience instead of love.<br />Ms. Austin paints a vivid picture of various relationships, and the marriage mores of Regency England. She portrays the relationships of the senior Bennett's, of Charlotte and her new husband, and of young, frivolous Lydia Bennett who marries at fifteen. Ms. Austin stresses the necessity of compatibility in a marriage, since divorce is almost impossible. She demonstrates the various forms compatibility takes in her characters' relationships.<br />This much beloved Jane Austin novel is one of my favorites.

Divorced, intelligent, and lovely, Helen MacFarquhar moves back to her childhood home, Pequot, with her 11 year old daughter Emily. Here in this small Connecticut town by the sea, populated primarily by middle-class intellectuals working at a nearby university, Helen opens a bookstore, Horatio Street Books. She is adept at seducing customers into buying \\"just the right volume,\\" knowing they will enjoy the book, as well as her attention, and return for more of both.<br />One glorious morning in early summer, Helen discovers a cryptic love letter mixed in with her regular mail. The intensely personal missive is addressed to \\"Goat\\" from \\"Ram.\\" Initially Helen is fascinated. She searches for the envelope, and potential clues to the author's identity amidst the trash, but cannot find anything. She eventually becomes obsessed with the letter's lines and sentiment, as she reads and rereads it. Who are Goat and Ram? Is the mysterious letter meant for her, or was it dropped in her store by mistake? Who wrote it? Who is the intended recipient?<br />All who enter the bookstore, and some who don't, are suspect. The mystery remains unsolved throughout the summer, but never far from Helen's thoughts. It is a summer of change. Emily is away at camp for the first time. Helen is alone also, for the first time since Emily's birth. Although she misses her daughter, she is happy in her solitude. Then her mother and grandmother come for an extended visit. And Helen begins a love affair with 20 year old Johnny, a college student working at the bookshop for the summer.<br />Their relationship captures the passion of their bodies, and the intimate connection between their minds and emotions. Readers will find themselves seduced into believing in this unlikely duo. Cathleen Schine's writing is sharp and witty as she follows the rapid workings of Helen's mind. The dialogue is believable, and frequently original, as are the characters.

Linda Voss, our heroine in \\"Shining Through,\\" is a smart, savvy, sassy gal from a shabby neighborhood in Queens, NY, & a proud graduate of Grover Cleveland High School. She is also partially Jewish. Having been raised with her paternal grandmother, a Jewess who longed to return to her beloved Berlin, Linda speaks German like a Berliner. This is crucial to the plot.<br />Though quite lovely, Linda is still single at 31, because she had yet to meet a man she loved enough to marry. She works, by day, as the bilingual secretary for gorgeous, super-smart Yale lawyer, John Berringer. By night, Linda fantasizes of romance with her boss, the Wall Street Lawyer. But can a high school grad, from a lower-middle class Queens neighborhood, find happiness with a handsome Ivy League professional, and live the life of a blue-blooded, to-the-manor-born lady? Linda's other primary extracurricular activity, besides John watching, is her voracious interest in Germany's war with Europe and the Jewish People. Susan Isaacs juxtaposes, with much wit, Linda's banal commentaries about her everyday existence with the earthshaking events that are unfolding worldwide. \\"On the last normal day, Hitler sent endless cables to his generals, Mussolini had several recorded temper tantrums, Neville Chamberlain took a long silent walk, and the secretaries of Blair, VanderGraff and Wadley ate lunch.\\" And, while arguing with a friend, \\"What's the percentage in turning to mush under a little pressure? Like that British boob who gave away Czechoslovakia.\\"<br />Ms. Isaacs chronicles Linda's rapid ascent from lonely secretary with a crush to Cinderella-wife, married to the man of her dreams, with humor and style. Or is she...married to the man of her dreams? Life moves on and so does the War. Linda and her new husband, Mr. Berringer, move to Washington, as he becomes involved in the workings of the infant OSS. The now, Mrs. Berringer, also goes to work for the OSS, as her language skills are needed even more than her secretarial skills. The fact that she easily passes FBI scrutiny doesn't hurt her employment opportunities either. She becomes the secretary of the head of the Organization, an older man she respects and admires. And for the first time in her life, she is truly intellectually stimulated, as she finally gets an opportunity to work against the Nazis - even though it's from behind a desk in Washington. As the international tension increases, so does the tension in Linda's marriage. Ms. Isaacs develops Linda's character well, allowing the reader to see her emotional growth, along with a growing cynicism and a determination to wean herself away from a destructive relationship. When she makes her decision to enter Germany and spy for Washington, she is a far different woman than the one we met originally, although the potential was noticeably there.

Roberta Gellis' &quot;Roselynde,&quot; is Book One of &quot;The Roselynde Chronicles,&quot; a series of six extraordinary novels of historic fiction. This epic saga of the heirs of the English land holdings, Roselynde, begins with the story of Alinor Devaux.<br />Lord Richard, later to be called King Richard, Coer de Leon, is soon to be crowned. The year is 1189 AD and Alinor is sixteen years old. Her grandfather, and sole guardian, died recently, leaving her the wealthy heiress of Roselynde, Mersea, Kingsclere, Iford and many other estates, including a busy port to France, making Alinor a marriage prize many coveted. She had been raised by her grandparents to read, write and use her ample intelligence to manage the estates that would be hers someday. Most woman of this period were not taught to be literate, let alone to manage estates and accounts, vassals and serfs, to maintain discipline and be judge and jury. Since her guardian's death, Alinor performed these responsibilities successfully. She and her vassals had been in training for many years - Alinor to lead and rule, and her people to respect, protect and follow her.<br />Queen Alinor of Aquitaine, Dowager Queen of England and Richard's mother, visits the Roselynde holdings to determine what is to become of the wealthy heiress. On the one hand the Queen believes that Alinor should be wed and have her husband take responsibility for her wealth. On the other hand, she identifies and sympathizes with her namesake. The elderly Queen had been raised to be freethinking and independent, and as a young woman had given many of the great men of Europe and Byzantium a run for their money. Alinor, who is determined to wed for love or not at all, persuades the monarch to allow her to remain single and to accept, in the name of the Crown, the annual estate income that would normally go to a husband. Sir Simon Lemagne, a knight and warrior who has been the Queen's loyal liegeman for much of his forty-five years, is appointed warden to Alinor and her holdings.<br />What begins as a friendship between warden and ward, turns into respect and great love. The difference in ages does not matter to Alinor. She finds a soulmate in Simon, and he loves for the first time...not the courtly love and allegiance he feels for the Queen, but with earthy passion and the desire to settle down and raise a family. The new King, however, does not want the match, thinking to wed the young heiress to someone who would more benefit the Crown.<br />Ms. Gellis sweeps the reader through the pageantry of the Royal Court and the world of knightly love with great accuracy. She details the political treacheries of the time; the rivalries that exist between Richard and his brother John, the intrigues of the despised William Longchamp, Chancellor and Chief Justiciar of England...and favorite of the King, and the ambitions of the King of France who wants to reclaim his land on the continent, now owned by Richard. She transports us along with Richard and his legions to Byzantium and Jerusalem on the Crusades, while England is left in the hands of scoundrels.<br />Roberta Gellis is superb storyteller of great talent.

Let me first state that Ms. Klaypas is one of my favorite authors, and one of the best writers in the Romance genre. I don't think I have read any of her books that I would rate below 4 stars - until now. \\"Only In Your Arms,\\" however, is only a 3 star novel. The storyline is very simplistic; the mystery too obvious; the characters are predictable and lack the usual complexity; and there is little of Ms. Kleypas' humor here. As always, however, the chemistry between the two main characters is electric and the sex is steamy.<br />A young Creole woman, Lysette Kersaint, flees an arranged marriage to a man who revolts her, only to fall under the protection of a man she fears, Maximilien Vallerand. Mr. Vallerand, who rumor has it, murdered his first wife, just happens to be the mortal enemy of Lisette's betrothed - his first wife's lover. Maximilien weds Lysette, for revenge against his enemy, and because he is attracted to her innocence, lack of guile...and her beauty. He is smitten. The story unwinds with the development of the newlyweds' relationship, and the unsolved mystery of the first wife's violent murder hanging over them. The most complex character in the novel is Justin, Max's son by his first wife. Since Justin plays only a small, but important role, in this novel, hopefully, he will get a book of his own in the future.<br />I am certainly not panning this book. It's not bad. I know I am in the minority here, but I would suggest that readers try some of Lisa Kleypas' really great novels first, like: \\"Give Me Tonight,\\" Dreaming Of You,\\" \\"Then Came You,\\" and \\"Someone To Watch Over Me.\\" Here you will find the author at her best!	2003-07-08

On a cold spring morning in 1932, fourteen-year old Karl Adare and his eleven-year-old sister, Mary, arrive by freight train in Argus, North Dakota. Abandoned by their mother, they have come to look for their mother's sister, Aunt Fritzie, who runs the House of Meats, a butcher shop, with her husband. The two Adares lose each other. Karl is frightened by a dog and runs back to the boxcar, and Mary runs the other way, toward town. And so begins the forty year saga of a family, and a community.<br />Through the years the family holds together through the tenacity of relationships, in a fierce and passionate drama, filled with Erdrich's dark humor. Changes sweep across their lives - birth, death, madness. Change also comes in the form of a growing sugar beet industry. Ms. Erdrich story chronicles Mary's life, as she puts down roots in Argus. She also keeps track of the tragic and sensitive dreamer, Karl, on his endless road journeys. He seem to compulsively flee emotional ties, and yet returns to Argus, again and again. At one point Karl says, \\"I give nothing, take nothing, mean nothing, hold nothing.\\" He struggles with connection - with the past, and with his family and community. Mary's astounding dreams and fantasies also play an incredible and surreal role in the novel.<br />Themes of parenting and abandonment, jealousy, sexual obsession, and great love play out with passion in Ms. Erdrich's complex and believable characters, as does her portrayal of people's aggression and the self-destructive side of human nature. Her narrative is written with beauty, clarity and pure magic. This is not an easy book to read, nor is it always pleasant. It is, however, well worth the effort.<br />Like many of her characters, Ms. Erdrich has a foot in two worlds. She grew up in Wahpeton, North Dakota, near the Bureau of Indian Affairs school where both her mother, of French-Ojibwe descent, and her father, of German descent, taught. She writes movingly about Native Americans \\"whose nobility resides in their ability to make their lives work.\\"nobility resides in their ability to make their lives work.\\"	2003-07-07

She was raised in an observant Jewish home, and studied Torah and Talmud. When she was fifteen, her beloved mother died of cancer, and Ms. Pogrebin, because she was female, could not be counted to form the necessary \\"minyan\\" to say the traditional mourner's Kaddish, (prayer), for her own mother. Her father, who never seemed, or apparently cared, to understand how marginal and rejected she felt, called the synagogue and had another man sent to their home, where they were sitting shiva. Time has brought change to the Jewish religion. Today a woman can form a minyon, the group of ten Jews necessary to recite formal prayers, in  Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist Movements. But these changes did not happen in time for Letty. A few years later, while she was still in college, her issues with her father, and with the male dominated Jewish religion, became intertwined. Her feelings about her \\"father and her faith merged.\\" She writes, \\"I also cut off my formal affiliation with Judaism. Merge the Jewish patriarch with patriarchal Judiasm, and when you leave one, you leave them both.\\"<br />\\"Deborah, Golda, And Me,\\" is Letty Cottin Pogrebin's story of her struggle to reconcile her feminism with her Jewish faith. She writes with intelligence, passion, honesty, and eloquence about her determination to fight against being a marginal person in her religion, and in her life. This book, in a sense is a record of many of the battles waged in her war for personal and political power.<br />She was active early on in the women's movement and was the founding editor of Ms. Magazine. When she reflects on the broad purview of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s, she cannot explain why she felt no curiosity about the status of Jewish women or the problems of Jewish girls in less hospitable environments then those in which she grew up. \\"I don't know why I wasn't motivated to investigate religious sexism, or to integrate some of my private spiritual insights into my general feminist framework. Even if I did not choose to act as a Jew in the Women's Movement, why didn't I at least act as a feminist among Jews?

I especially appreciate Letty's anecdotes of Jewish holiday celebrations with family, while her mother was still alive.

Alice Miller's \\"Drama Of The Gifted Child,\\" was originally published as \\"Prisoners Of Childhood; The Drama Of The Gifted Child,\\" in 1981. I read the book over 20 years ago, and recently reread it. I find that it is just as relevant, wise and perceptive today as it was then. Ms. Miller was a practicing psychoanalyst, who gave up her work with patients to write books, for the layperson, primarily dealing with early childhood abuse. In a new Forward, Miller continues to disavow psychoanalysis. Although I am not in agreement with her on this, she continues to be one of my heroes.<br />Ms. Miller, who writes an elegant and easily understandable prose, discusses here the issue of children raised by a narcissistic parent(s). She explains that this book is not about high I.Q. children, but about those who were able to survive an abusive childhood because they developed an adequate defense system. At a very early age the child intuitively apprehends the parent's needs. Since the parent, especially the mother, is the child's soul source of survival, the child strives to please, fearing disapproval, or abandonment. Thus, the child sublimates his needs for the parent's. Roles reverse and the child frequently takes on the parent's responsibility as emotional caregiver. This impedes the growth of a child's true identity, and a \\"loss of self\\" frequently occurs. The child adapts by not \\"feeling\\" his own needs, and develops finely tuned antennae, focusing intensely on the needs of the all important other. Ms. Miller writes, \\"An abused child, (emotionally), does not know it is being abused, and in order to survive and avoid the unbearable pain, the mind is provided with a remarkable mechanism, the 'gift' of 'repression,' which stores these experiences in a place outside of consciousness.\\" Although, later in life, these \\"prohibited\\" feelings and needs cannot always be avoided, they remain split off and the most vital part of the true self is not integrated into the personality. The results are often depression, and tremendous insecurity.<br />Alice Miller makes her readers aware of the unexpressed sufferings of the child and the tragedy of the parent(s) own illness. As she frequently states, \\"any parent who abuses a child,\\" knowingly or otherwise, \\"has himself been severely traumatized in his childhood, in some form or another.\\"<br />Gifted children are often the products of emotional abuse by a narcissistic parent. However, if the child's great need for admiration is not met, for his/her looks, intelligence or achievements, he/she falls into severe depression. Miller says one can only be free from depression \\"when self-esteem is based on the authenticity of one's own feelings and not on the possession of certain qualities.\\"<br />Children need a great deal of both emotional and physical support from the adult. According to Miller, this adult support must include the following elements in order for a child to develop to his or her full potential: \\"Respect for the child; respect for his rights; tolerance for his feelings; willingness to learn from his behavior.\\"<br />Miller also writes about the \\"origins of grandiosity as a form of denial and its relationship with depression.\\" Another interesting chapter deals with the \\"process of parental derision\\" and how it results in humiliation and possible psychic trauma of the child.<br />Alice Miller's extraordinary book, along with consistent psychoanalytic psychotherapy, enabled me to understand my past, modify behavior, forgive, and finally, best of all, to heal.

Gabriel Allon, one of the world's top art restorers, and former Israeli Intelligence Agent, is persuaded to return to action by his old mentor, the formidable Ari Shamron, Head of Israeli Intelligence. Allon has been living in Cornwall, England, working intensely on bringing a painting by Francesco Vecellio, brother of the great Titian, back to life. He is persuaded to leave the Vecellio and return to his old day job, to kill a man - Tariq. Tariq is the infamous leader of a Palestinian terrorist organization, who was responsible for the car bombing in Vienna, years before, that killed Allon's son and maimed his wife Leah. The radical Palestinian now plots to destroy the Middle East peace negotiations, which are presently in high gear.<br />A French Jewish celebrity model, Sarah Halevy, A.K.A. Jacqueline Delacroix, is recruited to assist Allon. She had worked with him in the past, as his \\"bat leveyha,\\" female assistant agent. They became lovers, and when the assignment was over, Gabriel returned to his wife and confessed all. Sarah/Jacqueline is still in love with him. Allon blames himself for the car bombing that destroyed his family. He believes that if he had not been unfaithful, his wife and son would never have accompanied him to Vienna, etc, etc..<br />Having read other suspense thrillers by Mr. Silva, I picked-up this book, hoping to enjoy another terrific read. Wrong! The shallow narrative and dialogue, are scattered and loose. The chapters are very short and insubstantial, and the author rapidly moves the action from Cornwall to Tiberias to Greece to Tel Aviv, Zurich, London, Amsterdam, etc., but not much happens except movement in trains, planes, boats and cars. Little is accomplished except lots of page turning by the reader. There is also time travel, in the form of various flashbacks, which serve to confuse whatever plot there is. The characters are not developed enough to form any real attachment to them. They all carry enough excess baggage to fill a cargo plane. Gabriel, with his lost family and need for revenge against Tariq; Tariq, who hates Allon for murdering his terrorist brother; Jacqueline with her grandparents killed in the holocaust and her unrequited love for Gabriel; everybody with mixed feelings for Ari Shamron. Oye...they all need intensive therapy!<br />The action and plot do begin to move a bit faster on, or around, page 205. I barely hung-in that long. And even when things do pick-up, the plots and plans are not believable, nor very exciting. I would pass on this one and read another of Daniel Silva's much better novels instead.argo plane.

There is an ever growing number of obese Americans. According to the Centers For Disease Control, 60% of all US adults are overweight; one-fifth of Americans are considered obese, up from 9% in 1991; and obesity among our children is a growing problem. We, as a nation of people determined to get rid of that fat, spend more than $30 billion a year on diet products. And most of the products and diets are doomed to fail. I myself, am not obese, but always ready to remove 10-20 pounds. With summer ahead, and the thought of exposing my bod on the beach, I picked-up \\"Dr. Atkins' NEW Diet Revolution\\" in April - admittedly a bit late to lose much weight before the call of Memorial Day weekend. I must say the diet works and I have lost almost 16 pounds (it is now July - so 3 months of dieting. Now, I am one who pursues my diets with a vengeance, and they have run the gamut over the years. So, keep in mind, I do follow the rules, strictly. Until I stop dieting. Maintenance just does not seem to be my thing. This is not Dr. Atkins' fault.<br />Twenty years after the 1st Dr. Atkins' Diet was published, there are new research results, new studies and new evidence that Dr. Atkins' was, and still is, correct on many of his theories. Over $ten million of the original diet books have been sold, and now the good Doctor has published a New, revised edition.<br />In a nutshell, the goal of the diet is to assist you in changing your body from burning Carbohydrates to burning Fat; stabilize you body's blood sugar and stop cravings for sugar and other carbs, (the craving NEVER stopped for me!); demonstrate to you, the dieter, that you can lose pounds this way; and to get your body into, what is called 'ketosis'...the process that occurs when your body burns fat. It also causes smelly sweat, stinky breath and sometimes hot flashes. Are you totally grossed out? The price we pay for health and beauty!<br />The first two weeks are the most difficult. You should, (Must!), take a good multivitamin and a calcium supplement to avoid leg cramps, a side effect of this regimen - explanation in the book.<br />You must drink 8-10 eight oz. glasses of water per day...or more, if you can. Water cleanses the body of fat and other wastes. Make sure your multivitamin has plenty of potassium, because you lose it rapidly with all the water you will be drinking. Forget coffee, tea, sodas, etc...just drink the water.<br />You may eat lots of meat, fish, shellfish, chicken, pork - but there are limitations, (see book); hard cheeses, not American or processed; eggs; some nuts; fat (moderation is the key here) - butter, olive oil, mayo, cream cheese; 2 cups, (at least salad) of greens per day - the darker the green the better; vegetables that are LOW in carbohydrates - of, course, many of your favorites are high in that favorite food group(!). The book contains an excellent carb counter. You May Not Eat Sugar, Bread, Cake, Pasta, Potatoes, (I am beginning to cry), and the most difficult for me is to avoid most fruit, which is loaded with carbs. Maybe it would be easier at another time of year, but summer's bounty of peaches, nectarines, cherries are lost to us. Initially, no more than 20 grams of carbs per day. As I said, or as Dr. Atkins says, after the 1st two weeks you may increase the carbs a bit, but not by much.<br />For me this diet, along with exercise - you don't have to do anything too strenuous, but walking a mile or two a day really helps - does work. I can do this for the short term, a few months, maybe 6. I understand the maintenance program is not bad. I haven't reached that part yet. :) However, the thought of giving up bread, cake, ice cream, pasta, etc., for a lifetime, hurts my heart and decreases my will to live - Really Live!! I will check out Maintenance and see, however. I do recommend the book. It is informative, well written, has all kinds of charts and carb counters to assist with your weight loss.

In 1938, pro-Nazi Vienna, she was an intelligent, inquisitive law student, with an adventurous spirit. After Anschluss, the German's pressed the Austrian Jews for all their money and valuables in return for exit visas. Some families had to decide, because of a lack of funds, which of their children could leave for safer havens, and which were doomed to stay in Austria with their parents, and almost certain deportation. Edith's two sisters left the country, but she remained with her childhood friend and lover, Pepi, with the hope they would soon marry.<br />She was sent to a labor camp in the north of Germany to do backbreaking farm work, 12 hours a day, six days a week. The motto of some of the Jewish laborers was, \\"Life is beautiful, and it begins tomorrow.\\" Her mother was deported to the East while Edith was in Germany, helpless to assist or join her beloved parent. When she finally returned to Vienna, her home and family were gone. Her remaining friends, Jew and Gentile, with few exceptions, were afraid to assist her. Her beloved Pepi, whose Jewish father had married a non-Jew, was a weak man, dominated by his mother. And the mother wanted nothing to do with Edith. A prewar friend, who also happened to be a doctor, and a Nazi Party bureaucrat, assisted Edith, and another gentile friend obtained copies of her own identity papers for her. Edith writes, \\"Our faces will be imprinted on the hearts of those who are kind to us, like a blessing.\\"<br />So, she moved to Munich, in 1942, submerging her identity in the wartime Reich. Edith Hahn disappeared from the face of the earth and Grete Denner emerged to replace everything Edith had ever been. Grete was not only a new identity, she was a totally different woman; mild, meek, unassuming and uneducated - hard to pick out of a crowd. Thus began life as a \\"U-boat,\\" submerged beneath the surface of society in Nazi Germany. She writes, \\"Now I am like Dante. I walk through hell, but I am not burning.\\" Living in mortal fear, she found work as a nurses aide, and a room with a kind family. She met a handsome Aryan, Werner Vetter, who wooed her persistently. When he pressured her to marry, she finally blurted out her secret. Werner accepted her Jewishness, to the extent that he still wanted to marry and protect her. He wanted to sleep with her and have her take care of him. But her husband never rid himself of Nazi prejudices about \\"Jewish blood,\\" and resisted having a child with Edith/Grete. She, in turn, became the passive, perfect wife Werner desired, abandoning any remaining sense of self. The ironies of her existence increased as the war progressed, and Germany's doom became obvious to almost all. Then Werner, blind in one eye, was drafted and became an officer in the Wehrmacht. Edith/Grete became pregnant - the Ideal Aryan Wife, with a baby on the way and a husband at the front.<br />This is a powerful account of a person existing in a schizophrenic life, with constant fear of discovery, and almost no sense of identity. The isolation was devastating. One can only imagine Edith's survivor guilt, which most Holocaust survivors suffer from. Here she was living the \\"normal\\" life of a German Hausfrau, while millions of others, like her own mother, went to the camps and crematorium. She discusses this guilt frankly in the book. She was and is an extraordinarily brave woman. We are fortunate that, at great risk to her life, she kept a record of her survival and has chosen to share her inspiring story.<br />This intimate narrative is simply and intelligently written. Her tale is so gripping that it is almost impossible to put down. At times it does seem that truth is stranger than fiction. I highly recommend this autobiographical account of a woman's life in hell. It is a story like no other.hrough hell, but I am not burning.\\" Living in mortal fear, she found work as a nurses aide, and a room with a kind family.

Roberta Gellis is a master at writing historical fiction. I am reading her \\"Roselynde Chronicles\\" now, and each book is better than the next. \\"The Sword And The Swan,\\" the prequel to the chronicles, is an excellent account of a turbulent time in English history, but it is more history than novel. The focus here is on the action and the politics of the period. The only character who is really developed is the warrior Rannulf, or the \\"Sword,\\" of the title. Ms. Gellis' research is meticulous, as always, and she makes sense and clarity of a very confusing period in history. This is a book worth reading for the historic content alone. She also gives a most accurate, non-romanticized picture of medieval life in England.<br />Henry Beauclerc was King Henry I, of England, and succeeded his brother William II, in 1100. After the Conquest, in 1066, William the Conqueror, and the two sons that followed him, worked to unite the Saxons and their Norman conquerors. King Henry I forced his barons to swear an oath of fealty to him, to accept his daughter, Empress Matilda, as his successor and future Queen of England, after his death. The majority of the Norman, (English), nobility repudiated their oath when Henry died, and seated Stephen of Blois, (a grandson of the first King William) on the throne. Henry had been an absolute monarch and ceded little power to the barons. They hoped that Stephen would be a weaker feudal king, more suited to their own needs.<br />Stephen proved to be weak, indeed, and unable to control the barons, their armies, and struggles for power and more land. The kingdom was reduced to anarchy. Another claimant to the English throne arose from Anjou - Henry, son of Matilda. Many of the aristocracy, who had previously supported Stephen against Matilda, wanted Henry to take the throne from Stephen. Other nobles, who had never supported Stephen, and had remained loyal to their original oath, now supported Matilda's son. Stephen also had his armies, loyal followers and an ambitious, ruthless son, Eustace, who wanted to be king.<br />I am sorry if I bored you with all the historic details. I assure you that Ms. Gellis does a much better job than I. However, this is exactly what the book is about - the last power struggle between Stephen of Blois and Henry of Anjou, who finally became King Henry II of England, a strong feudal king.<br />Rannulf, the warrior knight, is loyal to Stephen, and much of the novel is about his relationship with the King and the reasons for his loyalty. Catherine, is Rannulf's third wife, and while Rannulf and Catherine's story gives the readers a clear portrait of a woman's place in this medieval world, it is not a traditional romance. More time is spent in battle and than in the bedroom. There is more talk of war and politics than talk of love. I do recommend reading \\"The Sword And The Swan,\\" if only to familiarize yourself with English medieval history.

Pablo Neruda's \\"Memoirs\\" is not a comprehensive autobiographical document. It is a personal memoir, recounted as if the author was sitting around a table, with good friends and a bottle of excellent Chilean wine, telling tales of the people, anecdotes and incidents that were so important in his life. \\"Confieso Que He Vivido,\\" means I confess that I have lived. And Sr. Neruda certainly did that...with zest, zeal and so much talent. The translation by Hardie St. Martin is a good one, but it does not do justice to Neruda's beautiful skill with the Spanish language. He romances the language, like no other, even with his prose.<br />Neruda was born, the son of a railroad worker, in the then frontier wilderness of Southern Chile in 1904. He led a bohemian lifestyle, dressing in black \\"like the true poets of the last century,\\" during his university years in Santiago. His shyness, the \\"kink in the soul,\\"...especially of women, took him a while to overcome. He describes the people and places of that period with great 'carino' (love). His political ideology began to form at that time also, and politics became an integral part of his writing. The Student Federation, student demonstrations and the subsequent repression, had a great impact on the young intellectual.<br />Neruda led a rich and fascinating life. World traveled throughout his life, he served as Chilean consul in Burma, Ceylon, and Java. He was the consul in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, and during this time \\"Nine Love Poems\\" from \\"Veinte Poemas de Amor y Una Cancion Desesperada\\" was published. It was at this time also, that his friend Federico Garcia Lorca was killed. Neruda was present in Paris to organize a worldwide anti-Facist congress of writers that would be held in Madrid. His writing about Spain during the war is heartbreaking. Returning to Chile in 1938, he found a burgeoning Fascist movement in his own beloved land.<br />I particularly enjoyed his account of the time he spent in Mexico, as consul. He tells of his encounters with the great Mexican painters there.<br />After returning home, Neruda ran for political office and was elected to Chile's Senate in 1945. He was later removed from his Senate seat after joining the Communist Party.<br />His friends included: Garcia Lorca, Ehrenburg, Picasso, Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, Octavio Paz, Miguel Angel Asturias, Gandhi, Nehru, Mao, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and most sadly, Salvador Allende.<br />Pablo Neruda's death, just weeks after the brutal murder of Chile's President Allende, is something I will never forget. I was living in Colombia at that time, and remember where I was and what I was doing when I learned of Allende's death, and later heard of Neruda's passing. It called to mind, then and now, my recollections, as a young girl, when President Kennedy's assassination was announced. I always thought Neruda died of a broken heart.<br />This is an exceptionally good memoir, told with great charm, in a series of vignettes. I highly recommend it, especially to anyone who has read and enjoyed Pablo Neruda's poetry - to my mind some of the most beautiful in the world. It also gives us a glimpse of the politics of the left from the point of view of a Latin American - not the usual perspective, and well worth while.e tells of his encounters with the great Mexican painters there.<br />After returning home, Neruda ran for political office and was elected to Chile's Senate in 1945.

Hillary Rodham Clinton states in her Author's Note, at the beginning of \\"Living History,\\" that she is writing a personal memoir, not a comprehensive history. If you want to relax and dig in for a fascinating, insightful read, then it is important to accept her statement/disclaimer. Do not expect more from the book than a well written memoir. Hillary was, after all, the First Lady, and this is her unique, nontraditional take on her time in that position. I do hope that someday, when Senator Clinton retires from politics and gains more of a historical perspective, she will take on the task of authoring a comprehensive analysis of the Clinton Administration. That is a book I will really look forward to reading.<br />Senator Clinton, a woman of my generation, writes with intelligence, wit, sensitivity and lots of savvy, about the experiences in her life that made her the woman she was on January 20, 1993, when she moved to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. It is important to understand who she was then, the product of an amazing time in history, especially for American woman, in order to appreciate just how unique she was as she began her White House years. As a woman - wife, mother, professional and a daughter of the '60s - Hillary came to the White House with the education, potential, goals (her husband's and her own), and ambitions that were totally unlike those of any First Lady before her. We catch a glimpse of the young woman who was the first student to speak at a Wellesley graduation - and who received kudos to boot. I appreciate and admire that particular early accomplishment and how hard she must have worked, scholastically and with student government, to be invited by her peers to speak. How many young women...or men...did any of us know in 1969 who could have delivered such an address to such an exacting audience? The accuracy with which she describes the issues and conflicts of the time, i.e., Vietnam, civil rights, political activism, the Equal Rights Amendment, brings back the period with all its upheaval, innocence and idealism. Hillary was a political activist, working within the system for changes that would benefit a majority of Americans, even in high school. She entered Yale Law School, when female matriculation was still a rare occurrence. During her early career she focused on children's advocacy, reform for migrant workers, education, and healthcare. In her twenties, Hillary was already a person with strong convictions, making and living history.<br />I enjoyed her account of her courtship with Bill, and do give him credit that he had the sense to stick with her and not select the Miss America figure that his Mom seemed to expect. From the get go, this was a couple that did well together. They were very attracted to each other, yes...and more importantly, their minds meshed.<br />Her account of the Health (insurance) Task Force, which she headed is disappointing. As Chairperson, she received a major appointment in President Clinton's administration, and I did expect a meatier description of the job, her duties, pitfalls, successes and failures...and, of course, the results.<br />Her anecdotes of foreign travel, especially the conference in China, and her take on the heads of state who came to the White House during her time as official hostess, make for interesting reading.<br />Many have faulted Senator Clinton for forgiving her husband, and working to rebuild their marriage and relationship. Her reasons for sticking with Bill are very moving and make perfect sense to me.<br />When the former First Lady was interviewed on the Today Show, years ago, and talked about the \\"vast right-wing conspiracy,\\" many called her paranoid and naive. Now, though she admits that \\"conspiracy\\" was not the most appropriate word, she sticks to her guns. She believes that there is a powerful and moneyed right-wing element in our country who wants to impose their political agenda on America. They spend their money, not by publicly debatingissues of national importance, but by spreading scandal and destroying personal and professional reputations, at times using little more than rumor for their reality base. Although the \\"politics of personal destruction\\" had been employed long before the Clintons came on the scene, the radical conservative movement took these politics to a new high...or perhaps low is the better word... during the Clinton administration. The result was millions of US tax dollars spent trying to prove that the Clintons were guilty of illegal activities. None of the accusations proved true. Many years and investigations later, I believe that the country, and probably the Clintons, are still exhausted by all the needless vitriol.<br />I accept that both Hillary and Bill Clinton are super controversial figures.

Although the \\"politics of personal destruction\\" had been employed long before the Clintons came on the scene, the radical conservative movement took these politics to a new high...or perhaps low is the better word... during the Clinton administration. The result was millions of US tax dollars spent trying to prove that the Clintons were guilty of illegal activities. None of the accusations proved true.

The novels actually do chronicle history, with meticulous accuracy, so it is helpful to read the books in sequence to understand the politics and reigns of each king. The characters are so richly drawn, even the minor ones, that it is an added touch to watch them grow and mature with every new book.<br /><br />The story opens during the reign of King John. The treacherous, cruel King has taxed his people heavily; there is political intrigue and moral laxity at court; international problems with the French, Welsh, and Irish bode ill for England's security; and the barons are unhappy with their monarch. The Church is unhappy with John also. He has tried to take control of the Church through his choice for the archbishop of Canterbury, and has been seizing Church revenues for the Crown. The Pope has excommunicated him.<br /><br />Joanna, Alinor of Roselynde's teenage daughter, has consented to a betrothal with Sir Geoffrey Fitzwilliam, her stepfather's squire of old, who is now a landed knight and budding warrior. He is also the illegitimate son of the King's half brother, and so has royal Plantagenet blood. Alinor and her husband Ian, leave for Ireland to assist the Earl of Pembroke in keeping the peace. They place 20 year old Geoffrey in charge of their vassals in case of war with the Welsh, knowing that Geoffrey's father will back him up if necessary. Joanna is to take charge of their land holdings. Like her mother, Joanna is literate, independent, and trained to care for her people and land, making difficult decisions when needed. Her temperament is less volatile than her mothers and she keeps her feeling to herself. Although she is pleased with her betrothed, who she has known since childhood, she is afraid to love. She has seen war, suffering and loss, including the death of her beloved father some years before. Joanna is a courageous young woman, but fears to lose her heart to Geoffrey, and hopes for a steady, companionable relationship, no more.<br /><br />As Joanna's and Geoffrey's relationship changes, so does the political climate in England. There are more storms than fair days here, however. A hard war begins with Wales. The Pope absolves all men from their fealty to King John. Philip of France now holds Normandy, which belongs to John. And the King, and Isabella, his Queen, conspire against Geoffrey and Joanna.<br /><br />Ms. Gellis takes us on an incredible journey through the King's court, medieval keeps, sieges  and battles for life, land and honor, the horrific fire that devastated London in 1212, the signing of the Magna Carta by King John at Runnymede and his repudiation of the charter later. Civil War tears the country apart and King Philip invades England with mercenaries. This is exciting stuff!<br /><br />Joanna and Geoffrey love, marry and are separated by the many events that impact the country. Joanna, at one point must travel, during the war with the French, to rescue her husband who is near death.<br /><br />I liked this book very much, to say the least. However, it does not merit the five stars I gave the first two books in the series. Because of the turmoil of John's reign, the many problems are reflected in the relationship between the two main characters. While this is realistic, it was difficult to read about depressing times and depressed people. But, hey! Four stars is very good!<br />JANAefore.

I love English history, especially the period from King Edward IV's reign through the Tudors. I am also a big Antonia Fraser fan. So, before I picked up this history of King Henry's hapless wives, I knew I would enjoy it. And I am not disappointed at all.<br /><br />Ms. Fraser writes with great elegance, and her usual wit, about the five women who married Henry VIII and how their lives impacted their times and history. She also describes each of these complex women, their unique characters as individuals, (not just as wives to a king), their motivations and ambitions. She outlines the ascent and decline of each of the women and how they related to one another, their peers and families...and to the King.<br /><br />Much of the book is about Catherine of Aragon, but that is to be expected. She was married to Henry for 24 years, and prior to their marriage, she was wed to his older brother Arthur, a cause for future problems for the realm and much heartbreak for Catherine. Queen Catherine is portrayed most sympathetically, and that is my inclination also. She was a noble lady, raised to serve as Queen, who loved Henry, almost as much as she loved the Catholic Church, which he was to break away from and use against his wife and their daughter Mary. I have always wondered how Henry's character, his country and history would have changed if Catherine had born him a healthy son. Catherine was a strong woman of great faith, and nothing she ever did justified the treatment she received. One of the most poignant sentences in history, is one of Catherine's last. As she lay dying, she dictated a letter to the husband who had so ruthlessly abandoned her. She bid her scribe to write: \\"Lastly, I make this vow, that mine eyes desire you above all things. Farewell.\\"<br /><br />Anne Boleyn is an extremely well-educated woman, and very independent, especially given the times. And Henry is obsessed with the idea of possessing her. Anne plays his obsession to the hilt. Fraser describes her complex and ambitious nature, as well as the politics of her downfall, with great skill. Poor Jane Seymour's mild manner was a temporary, but welcome, relief to Henry after Anne. However Queen Jane's narrative is brief, as was her life. She died after birthing Henry's only living son.<br /><br />Anne of Cleves, perhaps the most politically astute of Henry's wives, certainly the one with the best survival skills, was thrilled to be cast-off and allowed to keep her head.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the naive and beautiful Katherine Howard, Henry's \\"blushing rose without a thorn\\" went the way of Anne Boleyn, because of promiscuity, lack of savvy, and church politics.<br /><br />Catherine Parr, a woman of extraordinary intellect, was one of only eight women whose writings were published during the reign of Henry and his father. She was fortunate to become aware of a plot against her before she met the same end as Queens Anne and Katherine.<br /><br />Ms. Fraser draws a lavish portrait of court life with its moral and political intrigues. She details the struggle for international power, and clearly explains England's break with Rome and the beginning of the Protestant Reformation.<br /><br />This is a superb and very readable history, that has been meticulously researched.

It has great literary merit, but I do not think it is her best work. The novel contrasts the lax moral attitudes of the British aristocracy with the focused dedication of the Jewish Zionists. Given the typical anti-Semitic sentiments in Victorian England, and the little known world of the Jews and the Zionist Movement, Ms. Eliot's made a brave and idealistic effort by writing this book.<br />Ms. Elliot describes the lives of British Jews, a society-within-a-society, of which most of her contemporaries were oblivious, through her hero Daniel Deronda. Through her heroine, Gwendolyn Harleth, who marries for money and power rather than love, Eliot explores a side of human relations that leads only to despair.<br />Daniel sees Gwendolyn, for the first time, at a roulette table. He is fascinated by her classical, blonde English beauty, and vivacious, self-assured manner. When Ms. Harleth is forced to sell her necklace to pay gambling debts, Deronda, a disapproving observer, buys back the jewelry, anonymously, and returns it to her. This is not the last time the deeply spiritual and altruistic Deronda will feel a need to rescue Gwendolyn.<br />Daniel was adopted by an English gentleman at an early age. He has received affection, a good education, and to some extent, position, from his guardian. However, Deronda has never been told the story of his true parentage, and sorely feels this lack of roots and his own identity. Not content to play the gentleman, he always appears to be searching for a purpose in life.<br />Daniel's and Gwendolyn's lives intersect throughout the novel. They feel a strong mutual attraction initially, but Gwendolyn, with incredible passivity, decides to marry someone she knows is a scoundrel, for his wealth. The decision will haunt her as her life becomes a nightmare with the sadistic Mr. Harcourt, her husband.<br />At about the same time, Daniel inadvertently saves a young woman from suicide. He finds young Mirah Lapidoth, near drowning, by the river and takes her to a friend's home to recover. There she is made welcome and asked to stay. She is a Jewess, abducted from her mother years before, by her father, who wanted to use the child's talent as a singer to earn money. When young Mirah forced her voice beyond its limits, and lost her ability to sing, her father abandoned her. She has never been able to reunite with her mother and brother, and was alone and destitute, until Daniel found her. Daniel, in his search for Mirah's family, meets the Cohens, a Jewish shop owner and his kin. Deronda feels an immediate affinity with them and visits often. He also comes to know a Jewish philosopher and Zionist, Mordecai, and they forge a strong bond of friendship.<br />Daniel finally does discover his identity, and has a very poignant and strange meeting with his mother. He had been actively taking steps to make a meaningful existence for himself, and with the new information about his parents and heritage, he leaves England with a wife, for a new homeland and future.<br />One of the novel's most moving scenes is when Daniel and Gwendolyn meet for the last time. Gwendolyn has grown from a self-centered young woman to a mature, thoughtful adult, who has suffered and grown strong.<br />The author is one of my favorites and her writing is exceptional. This particular novel, however, became occasionally tedious with Ms. Eliot's monologues, and the book's length. Her characters are fascinating, original as always, and well drawn. The contrast between the lives of the British aristocracy, the emerging middle class, and the Jewish community gives the reader an extraordinary glimpse into three totally different worlds in Victorian England.

David Halberstam has written an epic history of the young men and women, most still in their teens, who had the courage and nobility of spirit to fight the unjust status quo of segregation, and change the course of our nation's history. This is the story of the civil rights movement in the United States, beginning in the late 1950s and reaching its height in the mid-1960s. The story is told from the eyes of these young people - it is the history they made. \\"The Children\\" frequently put their lives on the line, risking physical danger and even death, to join the non-violent protests that would give all Americans equal rights under the law.<br />The Movement's leaders were two black southern ministers, both strongly influenced by the teachings of Mahandas Gandhi. These two men, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Jim Lawson, designed the framework of the mission. They stratagized like generals waging a unique war. Young college students, mostly African Americans, whose parents had sacrificed much to send them to university, were recruited as soldiers. These vulnerable and committed students were schooled in the nonviolent tradition, with workshops, such as: \\"Justice Without Violence\\" and \\"The New Negro In The New South.\\" We meet these children and hear of their experiences in Nashville, Montgomery, Birmingham, Selma, and many other towns and small cities all over the South. Halberstam documents the background of these young troops, their families, and struggles, growing up Black in America. He movingly describes the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, and the terrible violence of the Klan, and of ordinary citizens, steeped in bigotry, that endangered all of them. We read about the voter registration campaigns, and the founding of SNCC and CORE. The moral, philosophical and political roots of the civil rights movement, and the divisiveness within the group as different ideologies emerged, are well documented, as is the death of Dr. King.<br />Halberstam draws an amazing portrait of Jim Lawson, whose fervor and dedication moved a generation of Americans to action. The author truly excels, however, in bringing to life the young people whose story this is. We are updated, toward the end of the book, on the lives of the young activists today. This incredibly moving history reads like a novel you don't want to put down. And while we read about a most shameful period in our nation's history, who can fail to be proud of the young citizens who took action to make such important changes?im Lawson, whose fervor and dedication moved a generation of Americans to action.

I have now completed the first two novels in Roberta Gellis' \\"Roselynde Chronicles,\\" and am beginning book three. Warning!! It is difficult to put these books down, and continuous reading, especially in the evening, can cause insomnia! Ms. Gellis, along with Sharon Kay Penman, are the long reigning monarchs of historical fiction. Gellis' work is golden - her plots riveting, the research meticulous, and her writing elegant.<br /><br />\\"Alinor\\" begins at Roselynde Keep, England, in 1206 AD, seven years into the reign of King John (Lackland). Alinor's story actually starts in Book One, \\"Roselynde,\\" but you do not have to read the first book to enjoy this one. Alinor Devaux Lemagne is widowed at 29 years old. She had married her much older and beloved ward, Simon Lemagne, after finally obtaining King Richard's permission. They have two children, Joanna, age 9, and Adam, age 7. Like Queen Alinor of Aquitaine, whom she is named for, Alinor of Roselynde is a fiercely independent, well-educated, courageous chatelaine of vast landholdings. She had been trained since childhood to rule, and her vassals and serfs obey her with respect. When she and Simon married, her independence was not curtailed. This was a most unusual situation for women in medieval times, where their position was largely ornamental, when they were not breeding.<br /><br />Simon's squire of old, Ian de Vipont, is now a seasoned warrior, and a landed Knight and Lord. He has known Alinor since she was a girl of seventeen, and has always loved her, in a pure and courtly manner. Now Ian visits Roselynde to mourn Simon, pay his respects, and persuade the widow to marry him. He wants to protect Alinor and the children, especially since King John has no love for her. Ian fears that she will either be forced to marry a scoundrel who will abuse her and the children, or that John will take her land for the Crown. He does not need to work hard to convince Alinor. She is practical and understands his reasoning. He adores the children. And he is also an incredibly handsome and noble man. A wedding is held at Roselynde, with many of the aristocracy in attendance, including three bishops and John's illegitimate half-brother. Although Alinor deeply loved her first husband, he was much older and at times was like the father she never had. Her own parents died when she was a baby. Now she has a chance to make a life, filled with love, with a husband her own age.<br /><br />John is outraged at the marriage, even though he had given permission to Ian to wed whom he pleased, after serving the Crown well in the wars with France. The King had indeed plotted to hurt Alinor and take her holdings. Now he plans a greater revenge...on both newlyweds and their children.<br /><br />England was a country with severe problems during this period in history. John had received a kingdon deep in debt, owing to King Richard's Crusade, the ransom paid to free him from prison, his lavish spending, and his lack of concern for England. Richard's continent holdings, of Normandy, Anjou, Poitiers, etc., were his priority. John had greatly increased the taxes which, along with his nefarious political and personal intrigues, earned him the enmity of his barons. The taxes and poor crops had impoverished and bankrupted small farmers, many villeins and some of the lesser squirearchy. Many had been forced from their homes, destitute. Some joined gangs of lawless reavors, (like the legendary Robin Hood). There was much unrest and violence in the land, not to mention problems with France, Ireland and Wales.<br /><br />The novel is filled with pageantry and wonderful historic detail, including a tournament where Ian is named the King's champion. The events that occur during this tourney, are like a separate mystery within the novel. The suspense is thrilling, and the love story is so realistic.

Here America's 'nouveau riche' women gather; mothers and daughters who have been shunned by the elite, 'old money' society, scheme to marry their girls into the British aristocracy. Four beautiful young women become fast friends, as they dream and scheme together of potential suitors and titles in far off England. An English woman, unmarried and sophisticated, is hired to instruct the four friends in 'all that is necessary' to be successfully presented into British society. The girls' quest is most certainly not an impossible one. Many eligible, young aristocrats are short of funds necessary to keep up their vast estates. They are more than willing to marry American money, especially when wrapped in a beautiful, charming package, which will allow them to live in the style to which they are accustomed.<br />The story is told through the eyes, and from the hearts, of these young debutantes - wide-eyed, innocent and full of fun and American energy. Their longed-for entry into English society, and their subsequent marriages, joys and disappointments, as well as their strong, never waning, friendship for each other, is chronicled here with fascinating detail. The world of their childish fantasies is not the world of reality, as romance fades and financial worries, marital infidelities and lost love take the place of past dreams. They each struggle with the conflict between individual and social fulfillment, repressed sexuality, and the manners and mores of Britain's 'old families.' They discover secrets that were kept from them during courtship - intrigues, and hidden, devastating character flaws in their matrimonial choices.<br />Edith Wharton's descriptions of the wonderful American and British settings - the gorgeous countryside, great homes and extravagant furnishings, lavish clothing and courtship rites are remarkable. Each of the four young women have much in common, although their characters are quite different. Part of the glory of this novel is Wharton's development of her characters and their growth, as the young women mature with time and experience. The lesser characters are vividly drawn and complex. Her portrayal of the conflict between the American old society and the immense wealth of the newly rich robber barons and their socially ambitious wives, is an accurate and compelling glimpse of our past.<br />I know that Edith Wharton died before completing this extraordinary novel. I could wish, along with thousands of others, I am sure, that she had been allowed to live long enough to complete this masterpiece. However, Marion Mainwaring's conclusion does not diminish my immense enjoyment of the book in the least.ough their characters are quite different.

I am a Kay Hooper fan and have read and enjoyed most of her books. I was looking forward to reading \\"Once A Thief,\\" and now that I completed it, I find myself disappointed with both the novel and the author. Ms. Hooper writes, in an Author's Note, that ten years ago she wrote various short novels for Bantam's Loveswept Romance series. She became attached to one of her Loveswept heroes, Quinn, A Cary Grant-like cat burglar, right out of \\"To Catch A Thief,\\" and felt that she would like to work with him again. This book is a rewrite, and supposedly an improvement over the first attempt, where the author felt limited by the series' restrictions.<br />There is very little about Quinn in this novel. Neither he, nor his love interest, nor his capers figure prominently. He appears briefly, to meet and rescue Morgan, the exhibit director of a priceless collection scheduled to be featured as the \\"Mysteries Past\\" exhibit at a prestigious San Francisco museum. Morgan stayed after hours to catch up on work, and, as she was leaving she interrupted a robbery in progress. Quinn, who had been casing the premises, was also present to observe the robbery. He saved her from being discovered and they discover there is strong mutual attraction. They meet again on a few minor occasions, where he kisses her and steals her favorite necklace. Another time she rescues him from a kidnapping. That's it, that's about all for Morgan and Quinn, in this book that supposedly features him. The characters are just dropped, as are the readers, and told to wait for book two, the sequel. I do not mind sequels. I do mind buying a book to read about a character, and then being told that I have to buy another to get what I originally paid for. I take exception when a book does not stand on its own merit. I do not believe that \\"Once A Thief\\" is a complete novel. It is more like Part #1...to be continued.<br />The main story revolves around Wolfe Nickerson, the collection owner's half-brother. He is a security expert at Lloyd's of London, and responsible for supervising the security of \\"Mysteries Past.\\" He is not even featured in the book's synopsis on the back cover. He gets involved with Storm Tremaine, (Who thinks up these names? And how can a character with a name like this be believable?), a computer expert from Ace Security, installing a super-system for the super exhibit. She is really working for Interpol, however, and attempting to bait Quinn to rob the collection so that he can finally be captured.<br />A ho-hum, predictable plot, cardboard characters, except for Quinn...but we don't have too much of him to sink our teeth into...metaphorically, of course. So what we get with \\"Once A Thief\\" is one-half of a book...and not the right half to boot. I refuse to buy the next installment, on principle alone. It is a shame that Ms. Hooper did not accomplish what she stated in her Author's Note.

She is really working for Interpol, however, and attempting to bait Quinn to rob the collection so that he can finally be captured.<br />A ho-hum, predictable plot, cardboard characters, except for Quinn...but we don't have too much of him to sink our teeth into...metaphorically, of course. So what we get with \\"Once A Thief\\" is one-half of a book...and not the right half to boot. I refuse to buy the next installment, on principle alone. It is a shame that Ms. Hooper did not accomplish what she stated in her Author's Note. Quinn is fascinating, and I do understand why she wanted to write more about him.	2003-06-26

Edith Wharton's \\"The House Of Mirth\\" is a sad, but brilliant commentary on the closed, repressive society of the rich, upper class, New York nobility, at the dawn of the 20th century. It is also the story of the downfall of one woman, who attempts to live by her own rules, with no sponsor and no money of her own. Her parents are dead and she lives with relatives.<br />Lily Bart is one of society's most eligible women, at the height of her powers, when the novel opens. Though she has little money, she has family connections, good breeding and the hope of coming into an inheritance. Beautiful and very charming, Lily has been brought up to be an ornament, as were most women of her class at that time. She is a gilded bird with a noble heart, but clearly she is not aware of the restrictions of her cage. Part of Lily's tragedy is that she does have character, spirit, and a conscience. However, she does not know how to align these attributes, with her ornamental avocation, and her ambitions to marry a wealthy man of good birth.<br />As expected, Lily is popular with both bachelors and married men. Most of the bachelors propose marriage at on time or another. The only man she has real affection for is her dear friend, Lawrence Seldon, a barrister, whose lack of income makes him entirely unsuitable as a husband. Lily had developed a gambling habit to support her lifestyle, and supplement her allowance. An unfortunate losing streak has put her into debt. In her naivete, she forms an unsavory business alliance with a married man. Later, she is unjustly accused of having an affair with him and their business arrangement also come to light.<br />Her family cuts her off without a penny. Society friends and connections reject their former darling, trying to extricate themselves from any repercussions Lily's indiscreet behavior may have on their reputations. Former friends turn vicious. The irony is that Lily has never committed any of the sins she is accused of. Several of her friends have, and frequently...but their sins are committed with the utmost discretion. Lily's crime is indiscretion. Her beaus disappear, as do her marriage prospects. The hypocrisy of her class becomes more apparent to her, as she searches for a means to survive, with all the familiar doors closed in her face.<br />Lily seeks employment as a seamstress in the New York City slums, and lives there also, in a humble room with no refinements. Having no formal training and no real ambition, (her ambivalence about work is obvious), she sinks into deep depression and begins to decline. Laudanum helps her to sleep, and she becomes dependent on the drug.<br />Lily's descent, from society's beautiful darling to a disheveled, desperate woman living in a shabby hotel room, addicted to drugs, is disturbing reading, to say the least. Her decline seems inevitable, especially after we read of her many poor and self-destructive decisions. She seems to sabotage herself. However, Lily Bart is ultimately the victim of a cruel society that sacrifices anyone who does not conform to its expectations.<br />After reading \\"House Of Mirth,\\" for the first time several years ago, Lily's character has remained clear in my mind.

It is also historical fiction, about one of the most extraordinary events precipitated by mankind, concluding with ten of the most important seconds in world history - the countdown for the test of the first nuclear weapon at Los Alamos, New Mexico.<br />The story opens at Los Alamos in December, 1944. U.S. Army Sergeant Joe Pena, a Pueblo Indian who had seen action in the Pacific, was specifically requested by the Project's lead physicist, Robert \\"Oppy\\" Oppenheimer, to join the select and top secret group, in New Mexico, as his personal driver and body guard. Oppy had known Joe in his boyhood, when he left New York, for health reasons, to spend the summer in New Mexico. It was one of the happiest times of his life. Young Joe taught him to ride...and years later had still retained Oppy's trust.<br />All the important historical characters are present at Los Alamos. Oppenheimer, his wife Kitty, scientist Klaus Fuchs, the Army general in charge of the project, Fermi, etc., are here. Anna Weiss, a fictional German Jewish mathematician, who had fled the Nazis, and been recruited by Oppy, is present. So is Joe's superior officer, Captain Augustino, an insane and bigoted intelligence officer with his own agenda. He believes Fuchs, Weiss and Openheimer are Soviet spies and has blackmailed Joe into informing on them...although Joe resists mightily and successfully, most of the time.<br />There is little suspense in this novel. After all, we know that the atomic bomb test was successful, as well as we know of the other bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the Enola Gay. We know now who was a spy and who was unjustly accused. The storyline, is centered on Joe Pena, a complex, talented and very underestimated man. He disappointed his family, and had been disowned by his now deceased mother. Joe will never be a white man, nor a black man - although his ability to play jazz on the piano and understand the language of music like a native born to the country of chords and riffs, may have made his soul part Afro-American. He is really no longer a Native American either. He has seen and partaken of too much of the world to ever come home again. Pena fought like a hero on Baatan, and has fought heroically in the ring. Boxing was his sport and he was good. Throughout much of the book, he has no hopes for the future - no dreams. He observes everything and everyone, and comments occasionally with his sardonic humor. He thwarts Augustino's paranoid plots and assists a few renegade Indians, who try to work native magic to disrupt the explosion to come. He listens to Oppie who has lost weight and sleep with his anxiety over the Project. At one point Oppenheimer, while waiting for the rain to stop so he can meet the deadline for the test, says, \\"I am like the king of a rainy country, wealthy but helpless, young and ripe with death.\\" Then, Joe, a lady's man - bedding officer's wives is forever getting him into trouble - falls in love with Anna Weiss. An opportunity to buy the Casa Manana, a nightclub in Santiago, NM, presents itself. Suddenly Pena dreams of owning the best jazz club outside of New York and Chicago...and the possibility of a future with Anna. The suspense does come Big Time, at the end of the novel, when all the forces at play, and the characters with their dillemas and choices, build toward their own personal climaxes - with an explosion that will impact the reader for some time to come.<br />If you are looking for an Arkady Renko thriller, this is probably not the book for you. There are pages, especially at the beginning, when the story plods along at an excruciating pace. I hung in there because I was caught up in the lyrical beauty of Cruz Smith's writing. His description of Joe on the piano, what and how he plays, is classic. \\"If blue skies were going to explode on them, they were ready, so he made the melody,'...bluebirds singin' a song' even as he brought the 'Moon' down a chromatic descent, a chord at a time. The tunes merged and split again, accelerating  until keyboard and crowd swung between flight and plunge and he cued the horns, who stood and hit Charlie Parker riffs that settled the argument by demanding 'How High The Moon?' as if it were the sun.\\" Can't help it. I'm a sucker for good prose. At one point Joe says, \\"Which is why I love music. You hit a C and it's a C and that's all it is. Like speaking clearly for the first time. Like being intelligent. A Mozart or an Art Tatum sits at the piano and picks out the undeniable truth.\\"<br />Smith's descriptions of the desert's, (nature's), glory, is ironically juxtaposed with man's destruction and mutilation of the natural environment - so poignant and so gruesome. The radioactivity increasingly seeped into soil and water. Cows had to be checked with geiger counters before they could be slaughtered for consumption. At times, some of the animals' mutations were visible to the naked eye. Wild horses were machine-gunned from \\"B-29's.\\" The author writes with a paintbrush. \\"The Hanging Garden got its name from the scarlet gillia, paintbrush and yarrow that had taken root and flourished in the turned soil of the hillside. The wildflowers were a brief, improbable splurge of colors - every shade of red, orange and madder - that turned and waved in any breeze crossing the dun drabness of the mesa.\\"<br />Lastly, Joe Pena is as strong and developed a character as Arkady Renko. I enjoyed every minute I read about him, and he will stay in my mind as a wonderful anti-hero of his time. J.

She crosses the English battle lines and enters the enemy camp with the intention of seducing the commander and then murdering him...a medieval Judith and Holofernes, if you will. He is very experienced in the ways of courtesans and it becomes obvious that Reyna is a novice at seduction...although very tempting. So, the Lady is captured and the keep is taken. Fortunately, the takers are the good guys.<br />Ian Guilford, the Commander, is an English mercenary, known for his way with the ladies and his feats in the bedroom. (Lord Of A Thousand Nights...right?) He is fascinated by Reyna, who is not captivated in return. Maybe that's why he is so taken with her? She has a mysterious past which intrigues him. Her much older husband died recently, supposedly poisoned. Rumor has it that Reyna is the prime suspect, as the sole inheritor of his land and wealth. She was married at age twelve to consolidate an alliance that would bring peace to the region. Fortunately, her early marriage enabled her to leave her abusive father and half brother. She loved her husband, who became her teacher, best friend and a father figure. If Reyna did not kill him, who did? And why? Now that she is a widow, her estranged father wants Reyna back. Other people are looking to protect her and/or to take her into their custody also. And Ian doesn't want to let her go.<br />Madeline Hunter, as always, writes with clarity and elegance. Her grasp of history and her original plots have made her one of my favorite Historical Romance authors. I was not aware that this novel is a sequel, or related to any of her other books, until I began to recognize some familiar characters. It was wonderful to read more about Christiana and David from \\"By Arrangement\\" and Anna and Morvan from \\"The Protector.\\" However, \\"Lord of A Thousand Nights\\" stands on its own merit. It is not necessary to have read any of Ms. Hunt's prior novels to enjoy this one.<br />I think this book is actually better than some of her earlier work because of the complexity of the storyline, and the variety of characters.

It is the story of a people's fight to stay on their land and to retain their culture and language. During this period in Scotland, called the Clearances, wealthy landowners paid henchmen to clear the land of crofters and tenant farmers. These farmers' homes and all their possessions were frequently burned or otherwise destroyed. Destitute men, women and children, whose ancestors had lived and worked this land for time out of mind, faced the elements and starvation, most without money for passage to America, Canada or Australia. Thousands died. The wealthy wanted to use the now available land to graze sheep, or to build hunting lodges for the nobility and emerging middle class. This was a much more profitable way to earn money than collecting rent from poor tenants.<br />Seventeen year old Mairi MacLeod's tiny family farm was destroyed, and her grandfather, Fearchar, killed during the Clearances. Fearchar represented the courage and the culture of the old ways. His deep love of his heritage, all things Gaelic, and his beloved harp, called &quot;Cridhe&quot; (Heart), was what kept the clan going in times of hardship. The harp had belonged to an ancestor bard who'd played at the court of Conn of the Hundred Battles. Fearchar taught the clan his songs: of war, peace, love, the harvest, and the sea. Mairi inherited the bard's voice and the magic to make music on the harp. She also inherited the noble heart, and the ability to endure, of a clan leader. She takes charge of the few remaining family members who decide to stay on the island, and vows she will never leave her homeland. They live in the ruins of an ancient tower, having had time only to build a roof, before the coming winter. They survive on their small harvest, fish and shellfish and seaweed. Clan members, men and woman alike, are inspired by Mairi's leadership, ingenuity, strength and guidance.<br />A dark and brooding army captain came to the assistance of the MacLeods and the Nicolsons immediately after the burning. He finds happiness that he has never known with the generous island family. There is an instant attraction between the captain, Iain, and Mairi and she falls in love with him. She keeps her feelings to herself, because the rigid class system of the time would never accept the marriage of a gentry-born man to a crofter woman. Mairi does cherish the little time they had together, usually with the family singing around the hearth, playing the harp and listening to Iain play the pipes. Other characters enter the story: a few crofter families are taken in when they are evicted; a Viking-like ship's captain becomes enamored of Mairi and wants to marry her; the new landlord, impressed by the clan's endurance, decides to assist them. Numerous crises arise: the potato famine hits hard; a brother is kidnapped, conscripted against his will by a ship's crew; Mairi's older brother seeks revenge for the burning of their croft; unexpected illness, etc. And the love story is a very unique one with a surprise ending.<br />Ms. Williams' writing is lyrical and poignant. Her characters, especially the original family members, are vividly portrayed. And Mairi is so three-dimensional...a courageous, honorable, and strong woman. The plot is sound, both fascinating and inspirational. The many subplots are filled with adventure. Above all, the history of the island and her people is meticulously researched, and beautifully told.e.<br />A dark and brooding army captain came to the assistance of the MacLeods and the Nicolsons immediately after the burning.

One Of Elizabeth Lowell's Best!	\\"Jade Island\\" is book two in Elizabeth Lowell's Donovan series. I think it is her best novel of the four. As always, Ms. Lowell's writing style is tight, her characters so alive, (the Donovans are a terrific bunch that I cannot read enough about), and her plot and subplots are riveting - filled with adventure and suspense; not to mention her love/sex scenes, which are always hot! I especially like Lianne Blakely, a smart, independent lady who knows what she is about...and how to stand up for herself.<br />Kyle Donovan, a gemologist, has decided to go into business for himself, leaving the family corporation, Donovan International. On his own, Kyle can travel the globe at will, searching for gems, antiquities...and adventure. Archer Donovan, Kyle's brother and CEO of the family business, hires Kyle as a consultant to investigate the authenticity of \\"The Jade Emperor,\\" purported to be recently acquired by a billionaire collector. The piece should be in the vaults of Hong Kong's Tang Family. If it is not there, then the priceless jade has been stolen and the theft could provoke an international incident. The US and Chinese governments are investigating also.<br />Lianne Blakely, a noted gemologist, is the illegitimate daughter of Johnny Tang. The Tang family does not accept her as one of their own, but trusts her and works with her because of her professional experience and her unacknowledged family connection. Her father asks her to seduce Kyle Donovan in order to have an inside track to Donovan International. The Tangs need the Donovan's for their continued success in the gem market.<br />Kyle, unaware of Lianne's motives, is out to seduce her himself. He wants to have an inside line to her family, and find out as much information as he can about the stolen jade. Archer, Kyle and the Tangs suspect that Lianne is involved in the theft.<br />The attraction between Kyle and Lianne is dynamite. The plot's tension increases when someone attempts to murder her. The research on jade is meticulous and the information fascinating. The history of Chinese family traditions is richly told, and more valuable to this reader than precious jade. What a fabulous book! I highly recommend it.ch on jade is meticulous and the information fascinating. The history of Chinese family traditions is richly told, and more valuable to this reader than precious jade.

Serafina is the Royal Princess and \\"Jewel of Ascencion\\" - Ascencion being a mythical island off the Italian coast, resembling Sicily and Corsica in nature. She is a 20 year old beauty; a willful, fairy-like creature. Every prince in Europe wants to marry her, as do many wealthy commoners. Her heart is taken, however. Since her earliest childhood she has adored her bodyguard and adopted older brother, Darius Santiago.<br />Twenty years earlier, when Darius was just 14, the King and Queen rescued him from his destitute life on the streets.  He was wild and starving -  but he managed, at his young age, to save the Queen's life. Since that time, he has been raised, educated and trusted as one of their own. Santiago is a dark hero, who keeps to himself, trusting no one - understandable, considering his past. He had risen in the ranks to Captain of the Royal Guard by age 20, and now, at 34, is Commander of an elite armed force and a spy for the King. He is the bastard son of a Spanish Count and a gypsy mother. His mother cared nothing for Darius and abandoned him; his father, a cruel and brutal man, cared nothing for him. Although he has noble half-brothers, they are not worthy of their rank or their inheritance. So, the Count, recognized his illegitimate son before he died, and Darius is now a wealthy man. His adopted family does not know this, however, because to Darius, his wealth and official position in society makes no difference. In his mind, he is still the abandoned offspring of a gypsy and a Spanish Grandee. He constantly tries to prove himself worthy of the Royal family's trust and affection. The most difficult thing he has ever had to do is ignore Serafina's love and pretend indifference to her. How could he betray her parents by declaring his love for their only daughter?<br />The Emperor Napoleon is ruling and conquering Europe as the novel begins. He needs the Ascencion Navy if he is to defeat the British. All the unmarried Bonaparte brothers and Napoleon's stepson have been offered as marriage choices for Serafina, in return for a political alliance. Neither Serafina nor her parents want such an alliance with France. So, the Princess becomes betrothed, out of duty, to a Russian general and nobleman - who murdered his first wife and is planning to overthrow the Tzar. The man is a ruthless brute. Darius has discovered this information while in Russia, doing a background check on the prospective groom, at the request of Ascencion's King. He returns home with the information in time to rescue Serafina from an attempted kidnapping by Napoleon's henchmen. Thus begin a series of events and adventures that will put lives in danger and risk the island kingdom...as well as the love between Serafina and Darius.<br />I really liked much of the plot, especially the historical detail.

I don't want to disclose more detail and ruin the story for those who have yet to read it. The pace of the novel is slow at first because of repetitious information and unnecessary dialogue. Much of the dialogue between Serafina and Santiago, especially in the novel's early stages, is totally fatuous. She sounds much too juvenile, as a woman, to have earned the love of a man 14 years her senior.

Frantic with worry, Honor moves into Kyle's cottage on one of the San Juan Islands, and hires a local fishing guide, Jake Mallory, to help her search the island chain for her brother. Big, bad, hunky Jake is not, of course, a real fishing guide - although he loves to fish. Jake used to work for the Donovan company, brokering amber. He is also somewhat of a soldier of fortune. The Donovan brothers suspect that it is Jake, not Kyle, who has the stolen gems and a priceless Russian antiquity, as well. So it is in Mallory's best interest to find Kyle so that he can prove his innocence.<br />The two are pursued all over the Pacific islands by local cops, the Feds, international operatives and spooky intruders. The chemistry between Honor and Jake is explosive. They are a perfect match and their feelings for each other are as palpable as is their mutual attraction. There is romance and caring here as well as sex. And the dialogue between them is witty, with an edge. Honor is quite intelligent, creative and independent. We also get to meet other members of the Donovan clan - which is one of the most interesting and fun families ever.<br />The dangerous adventures and mishaps never seem to cease. The details about amber and the Russian antiquity, the \\"Amber Room,\\" are fascinating. The San Juan Islands are so amazing that I am actually planning a vacation there.

I am a woman who was a very young woman back in 1968; the year of the Tet offensive. I absorbed any news I could get about Vietnam, back then, because so many of my peers - boys, really, friends from school and neighbors - were fighting there. Some of them never made it home. Many of them did, and I have heard some of their stories first hand. Nelson DeMille is a favorite writer of mine, so I didn't think twice about picking up this novel and settling in for a good mystery-suspense read. I am not at all disappointed, in fact, I feel like I have received an extra bonus with \\"Up Country.\\" DeMille delivers on the storyline, Big Time...but he also gave me an extraordinary picture of Vietnam, back then and today. And his account of the war, the battles, the country, the people, and the differences 30+ years make, are realistic and accurate. I feel like I made the trip myself - twice! I was also very moved by his account and his prose. I cried at times, which is a unique experience for me with a Nelson DeMille novel.<br />The plot is taunt with suspense and the characters lifelike and so  believable. Paul Brenner, an Army Chief Warrant Officer with the Criminal Investigation Division, has been ordered to return to Vietnam after 30 years, to investigate a murder. During the Tet Offensive, three decades before, an army lieutenant was killed by his captain. The crime was witnessed by a wounded North Vietnamese soldier. Brenner's superiors know this because the soldier wrote a letter to a relative describing the murder. The relative, another North Viet soldier, received the letter, and it was found on his dead body after he was killed in battle.

To put this review into perspective, along with my 3 star rating, I must state that I am a die-hard Janet Evanovich fan. However, after reading all of her Stephanie Plum series, one through eight, it is time for Ms. Evanovich to make some changes if she is to avoid the typical pitfalls of series books - the formulaic novel...and overkill. It is to her credit that she has kept readers eagerly coming back for more of Stephanie Plum, my all time favorite heroine. And while I do understand that series writers need to provide, (& to provide, & provide), the same background information so new readers will understand what is going on - the repetition is driving me crazy. We read the same jokes over and over again in each new book. They became tired 3 books ago. I don't mind rereading the facts. I do mind same old, same old. Enough! Just give us the basics about Steph's family, Grandma Mazur, Joe Morelli, (yes, he played choo-choo with her when they were kids), Ranger, Lula, Cousin Vinnie, (and yes, we have read at least 8 times about the animals), etc. Brevity in the face of tedium works. I am sure that the creative wit that conjured up the Plums, et. al., will be able to come up with new material in the future. If new readers would like to know more background, assuming they begin the series with book #9, they can read another book from 1 through 8. It's their fault if they begin with # nine, anyway.<br />The plot in \\"Hard Eight\\" is not as complex, or as interesting, as others. This simplistic storyline, along with the repetitious jokes, made this my least favorite of the eight books. I won't go into the details, others reviewers have already summarized the plot very well. I do not agree with those who say this is a darker story because of \\"the soupcon of child jeopardy\\" involved. There is no danger to a child here. The villains are especially tame and flat compared to Benito Ramirez, a real doozie, and other creeps from other bounty hunts!<br />I was glad that Ranger and Stephanie finally got together. We were left hanging in \\"Seven-Up,\\" with what seemed like sexus interruptus. I hate being left in the air about something as important as whether my fictional favorite has sex the with the \\"dark, mellow, mystery man\\" of her fantasies.<br />I really hope the next novel is more original and complex. Stephanie Plum is quite capable of multi-tasking. I also hope that Janet Evanovich loses much of the old material and comes up with something new and exciting.d Stephanie finally got together.

McCarry's nuanced, at times poetic, writing style, his ability to create real, flesh and blood characters who will move you, and his fast-paced, taunt storyline, put him at the top of the list for craftsmanship. There were actually moments when I found my eyes filling with tears, at a particular poignant passage, or at the loss of a favorite character. I don't do that easily. The man is Good! The background research is excellent and the historical details of the origins of the OSS and \\"The Company\\" are accurate.<br />The story takes us from the aftermath of World War I, in Germany, through World War II, the Cold War, and Viet Nam, with the creation of \\"The Outfit.\\" This would be the OSS and the CIA. We meet the earliest agents and watch them and their agency grow in a turbulent world on the brink of one war after another. We are never completely sure who can to be trusted, or whose version is true. A few of the Outfit's leaders know early on that there is a mole in the system who is betraying American interests and getting agents killed. The book takes us all over Europe, to Russia and China, Washington, New York and Boston in the world of international intrigue.<br />The novel's main character is Paul Christopher, a sensitive, intelligent young man who joins the \\"Outfit\\" at the beginning of W.W.II. His mother, Lori, is a Prussian Countess, his father, Hubbard, an American, Yale graduate. They were never political people but hated stupidity and cruelty. Living in Berlin, Hubbard wrote novels and poetry, Lori countessed, they both made friends, traveled, loved each other and had a son...before 1939. It was during those prewar years that we saw a colorful sub-cast of characters enter the picture. Friends and relatives traveled to and from Europe visiting the Christophers, many to play future roles in the drama. There were various types of bohemian life, (Berlin was booming with bohemians), artists, Bolsheviks, musicians, etc., that latched-on to the family in Berlin. Some of these folks were desperate to leave Germany after 1935. The Christophers sailed many Jews and Communists out of the country on their boat Mahican. The Gestapo knew. When the war began, Mom, Dad, and Paul tried to leave for Paris but were stopped at the border. Paul and his father were told never to return to Germany. They were classified as American citizens. The mother was taken away. She was nobility, but she was German. The writing is devastating. This event will occur in Paul's dreams, repeatedly, throughout, giving the reader a terrible glimpse of the Nazi horror.<br />Paul's father, Hubbard, until his death, never gives up the hope of finding his wife. He changes drastically with her loss. It is with details and character development like this that McCarry leaves the crowd behind. Hubbard joins the OSS. As Paul comes of age, he initially joins the Marines but is also recruited into the OSS. We follow their lives and careers, as well as those of their colleagues, friends and enemies. The tension builds as we begin to see the network of betrayal and lies build, and wonder who is responsible and to what extent.<br />As I wrote earlier, McCarry develops the characters, and their families in such a manner, that when you lose one, especially to violence, the loss is felt deeply. There is one scene when Hubbard tells Paul stories about his maternal grandparents, that are almost folk-like in nature, and I was awed at what an amazingly wonderful family this was/is. I forgot it was fiction for a moment.<br />The story moves to an extraordinary conclusion. I could not put this book down. I give it my highest recommendation.<br />PS - One of the reviewers commented that he thought two of the book's characters, a 60 year old senator and his 22 year wife, were too much...as in not believable? Hey, I was around in the '60s. There was most certainly a 60+ senator from the South with a 22 year old ex-beauty queen wife. Not only do McCarry's people seem real, some were taken from real life.s in not believable? Hey, I was around in the '60s.

This is another Bow Street Runner novel from Lisa Kleypas. Like the wonderful \\"Lady Sophia's Lover,\\" and the unbeatable \\"Worth Any Price,\\" (I'm an unabashed Lisa Kleypas fan...can you tell??), this story features realistic characters from mid-1800's England's burgeoning middle class, and not the usual nobility of the \\"haute ton.\\" Number 4 Bow Street is the headquarters for the relatively new force of organized police/dectectives, who keeps law and order in London.<br />Grant Morgan, one of the Bow Street leaders, has made his fortune and fame recovering stolen property for banks, serving as personal guard to the monarchy, and locating abducted heiresses. He is one of London's most eligible and unattainable men. One night he is called to a ferry dock along the Thames to investigate a drowning. The victim turns out to be quite beautiful and alive. Mr. Morgan recognizes and identifies her as Vivian Duvall, a famous courtesan who defamed him some months before. He brings her to his home to recover. Noticing bruises on her neck, Morgan realizes that someone had attempted to murder Vivian. She, however, has amnesia and can remember nothing of her past, neither her own name nor her profession, which seems to disgust her. Morgan is hot on the case of the murderer's identity and motive - and he's hot on Ms. Duvall's case also. He has lusted for her since the moment he met her, and wants to bed her, keep her for a while, and also to exact some revenge for her past scandal mongering.<br />But Vivian does not live up to her reputation on the one hand, and proves to be much better than expected on the other. Slowly, the secrets of her past emerge, as does the mutual attraction between Vivian and Grant. The mystery is not difficult to figure out, and the plot is undemanding, to say the least. However Ms. Kleypas weaves a story like no on else and her characters, with their sizzling chemistry, keep your eyes riveted to the page.<br />Lisa Kleypas novels are as addictive as good chocolate - but not fattening.

George Eliot, (nom de plume of Mary Ann Evans), wrote a literary masterpiece with \\"Middlemarch.\\" I was forced to read this in school at an age when term papers and grades meant more than absorbing the riches this novel contains. I recently gave it another shot, lured back into 19th century English lit. by easier reads, like Jane Austen, whose work I love, and the Brontes. But I don't want to compare apples and oranges. Let it suffice to say, I got back to \\"Middlemarch\\" 30 years later. And it was/is so worth the re-read!<br />Ms. Eliot created, with this book, an entire community in England in the mid-1800s and called it Middlemarch. She populated this provincial town with people of every station, local squires and their families, tradespeople, the rising middle class, (Middlemarch, right?), & the poor and destitute,  ruthless and honest. She crowded them together, with all their ambitions, dreams and foibles, in this magnificent literary soap opera, and wove a wonderful web of plots and subplots. Ms. Eliot also wrote scathing social commentary and used great wit.<br />The fortunes of Middlemarch are rising in this new era when machines and trains - fast, available transportation - are changing the world, the economy, the politics. Rigid social codes, the British class system, is in danger of being breached. Folks are out to make a quick buck, or a shilling - anything to acquire wealth and enhance social position.<br />Dorothea Brooks lives in Middlemarch. She is an intelligent, sensitive young woman, who wants to dedicate her life to important endeavors. She does not want to settle for a typical marriage and family, but looks toward a more noble cause. As a woman, a professional life is not open to her, nor is the pursuit of intellect, outside of marriage. She weds the elderly Rev. Casaubon, a cold, narcissistic man, thinking that by assisting him with his scholarly research and writing, she will find happiness.<br />Dr. Lydgate comes to Middlemarch to begin his medical practice there. He is an idealist, who has dreams of finding a cure for cholera and opening a free clinic. He meets blonde and beautiful Rosamund Vincie, who fancies him for a spouse...along with a new house, new furniture, an extensive wardrobe, etc.<br />A dashing, romantic Will Ladislaw, nephew of Rev. Casaubon, enters the story, as does Rosie's brother Fred, who wants desperately to marry his Mary, but is out of work and in debt. This cast of richly drawn characters continues to grow with the introduction of Mary's family, the Garths, the banker Bulstrode, friends, relations, and an evil villain or two.<br />This complex novel and portrait of the times, is one of the best reading experiences I have had in a long while.

Alex, super-cop, tough guy, rigid-with-the-rules, heart of stone, DeMarco is caught half-naked in the bedroom of a married woman. She is lying dead on the bed, nude, with signs of having been asphyxiated during a session of kinky sex. He pleads not guilty. No one listens...including Private Investigator, Valerie Parker. She had been hired by the woman's husband, who believed his wife had been cheating on him. And all Val saw, from the bar where Alex met the now dead lady in question, to the house where they returned together, was Alex and Mrs. Corpse - no one else around who could have done the deed.<br />Now Alex & Val have a history with lots of baggage. He was her superior officer when she was in training at the Police Academy, five years before. She was a wild lady who broke too many rules and got too creative with the solutions to be a good cop - so Alex believed. He decided to recommend her dismissal from the Academy. The evening before she was to be told bye-bye, in a meeting with the Lieutenant and Alex, Alex decided to tell her personally. He thought it would be less painful. So he dropped by her apartment, they had wild sex, he left her sleeping in the middle of the night...and he never told her. The next day, at the meeting, she learned she was no longer a police cadet - and she totally flipped out. Wouldn't you?<br />Val doesn't really believe that Alex, a stickler for the rules & Mr. Control Freak, would commit murder. All evidence to the contrary, he is a basically decent guy. But, no one else was with the victim at the time of her death - and Val knows because she was surveilling the place. When someone takes a shot at her, however, she really begins to believe that Alex is innocent. So Val & Alex wind up taking off to find the murderer.<br />Adventures ensue, i.e., wild animals, an attack by a Bengal Tiger, a burning barn, an \\"almost\\" rape by a sadistic ex-con, some terrific sex, etc., and we meet some interesting folks along the way, including a goofy deputy sheriff who means well but can't make a right move. Who said the path to love was easy, especially when facing a 20 year sentence for manslaughter.<br />I enjoyed this sequel to \\"I've Got You Babe.\\" Alex was so hard-boiled in that 1st novel, that I really looked forward to reading more about him. There had to be a softer, more vulnerable side. But this book is not as fast-paced as Ms. Graves's first attempt. And the characters are not as endearing as John and Renee. The action does pick up midway through, and the romance gets passionate - but it just doesn't rate 5 stars.fy deputy sheriff who means well but can't make a right move.

Her writing is very repetitious. Not to sound  picky, but in one short paragraph, for example, she writes twice, &quot;...had taken much longer than anticipated,&quot; about the same event. This kind of repetition occurs more than a few times &amp; really slows the novel's pace, as does lots of unnecessary, meandering prose. The story just drags on. There is no real mystery or suspense here. Some of the characters are interesting, and I cared about what happened to Amy/Shelly, Matthew, Trevor...and Bingo the cat and Jiggs the dog. However the villains, both Dexxter Foxx and Irene are cardboard, comic book-like characters. It is impossible to fear them - which kills the tension.<br />I think if Ms. Sawyer reworked the book, cut about 100 pages with some good editing, tightened up her plot and crafted Dexxter as a more human, sinister figure, she would have a good book. As is, the novel does not work.	2003-06-16

This was her final completed novel before her death, and was published posthumously. As is often the case with Ms. Austen's fiction, \\"Persuasion\\" deals with the social issues of the times and paints a fascinating portrait of Regency England, especially when dealing with the class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \\"up\\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point Austen makes here, is that one should not ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.<br />Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \\"break the connection,\\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl  or a viscount.<br />The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together.

The \\"English Assassin\\" was my introduction to author Daniel Silva, and to his art restorer cum Israeli spy, Gabriel Allon. This intelligently written, international espionage thriller, filled with intrigue and vengeance, is as good is it gets. Mr. Silva's style is reminiscent, but not derivative, of Ken Follett, Frederick Forsyth and John LeCarre. He is definitely in their league and oh, so original, with his 21st century relevant storyline. I have waited for a long time for an author of this caliber to appear and keep me on the edge of my seat, reading through the night. I was unable to put this book down.<br />Gabriel Allon is a brilliant Israeli art restorer, residing in Cornwall, England. He is a complex, melancholy man - not much humor here. Allon had worked for many years as an Israeli intelligence agent, and assassin, (when necessary), losing his young son and wife to violence as a consequence of his work. Now he just wants to restore paintings and be left alone with his torment and his guilt.<br />Allon is coerced back to active spy duty when he is asked to go to Zurich to clean the work of an Old Master for a Swiss millionaire banker. He arrives at his clients house only to find the man dead at his feet - murdered, obviously. Allon has too much of a history in Switzerland to call the police, so he attempts to flee the country. He is caught within a half hour, (pretty fast, even for the Swiss), and framed for the murder. Thus begins a chain of events that pairs Allon with the dead banker's beautiful, violin virtuoso daughter, as they seek the killer and the motive. Their search takes them all over Europe, where they begin to uncover secrets dealing with Nazi art theft, international conspiracy, priceless hidden treasures buried in Swiss vaults, a decade-old suicide, multiple murders, and a very mysterious English assassin. This assassin fellow is one of my favorite villains - and his Corsican friends are just too much!<br />Mr. Silva's characters are believable and fascinating. His plots and subplots are beautifully developed and gripping; his historical detail is on the money. What more could you ask for in a novel? I cannot wait to get my hands on more of his books. Hopefully when I catch-up and read what I have missed, Mr. Silva will have written another winner.vable and fascinating.

She cannot take another 80 hour work week, and she doesn't want any of the perks that go along with it. She is tired of speeding through her rat race life before she has Lived it - with a capital \\"L.\\" So, she of the analytic brain and practical mind, trades in her luxury condo for a cabin in the backwoods of Alaska - sight unseen! She always knew that Alaska, where men outnumber women by a large percentage, would be the place where she could find the perfect husband. And she wants to get married and start a family before it is too late.<br />Alex, an upbeat, self-sufficient woman, travels with small sports car and large dog across the country and heads due north. She eventually finds her Alaskan wilderness cabin, which needs a lot of work before the deep freeze sets in, and she meets her nearest neighbor, Michael Casey, an incredibly hunky pilot. Sparks fly but he is a confirmed bachelor. She is as undaunted by his resistance as by the frequent disasters that befall her while learning to be a wilderness woman.<br />This is a good, fun read.

She had devoted 10 of her 32 years to being a wife, (of an ambitious and wealthy philanderer), and a mother. Now she needed a job. Her Aunt Elsie was coming to spend the summer to care for the kids, but so far - no luck in the job search. Lizabeth had graduated years ago from Amherst College with a degree in history. Her resume is that brief, and her liberal arts education, minus experience, certainly does not make her competitive in the job market.<br />She stumbles on to a construction site where she meets Matt Hallahan, a real estate developer and CEO of his own company, as well as a carpenter, man-of-all-trades...and gorgeous hunk to boot! He is immediately smitten by Lizabeth and hires her as a laborer-in-training - on the condition that she work with him. He is terrified that she will kill herself while hammering nails. And so begins the love story, with a minor mystery, and about 180 pages of smiles. Go for it!!!	2003-06-14

I was skeptical when I picked up \\"Tipping The Velvet\\" at a local bookstore. I do not like labels, and Sarah Waters's first novel had been touted by the press, and readers alike, as a \\"lesbian novel,\\" whatever that means. However, the book's synopsis on the back cover, drew me in and I took a chance and bought it. I am so glad that I did. What a delight!<br />This is a historical novel, set in a Victorian England that few have glimpsed. And \\"Tipping The Velvet\\" allows us to view it all, center stage. It is a story peopled with characters that are fleshed out so believably, it is almost like reading with 3-D glasses. The characters, especially Nancy Astley, come right off the page and have the capacity to touch your heart and make you care...deeply.<br />Nancy is born and raised in an English seaside resort where her parents own an oyster restaurant, and Nancy can shuck with the best of them. She seems perfectly content with her lot in life, loves her family and imagines that someday she will marry one of the neighborhood boys and have a family of her own. During the summer months, when business is booming, Nancy frequents a nearby town's music hall for entertainment. Thus Passion enters her life with a capital \\"P.\\"<br />Nancy sees a male impersonator perform for the first time on an evening excursion to the hall. Not just any male impersonator...but the ever so seductive Miss Kitty Butler. Nance is entranced and obsessed with Kitty. She schemes to meet the object of her devotion and becomes first, Kitty's friend, then her employee/girl Friday. Her once normal life is turned topsy-turvy, filled with passionate fantasies. Her family is delighted with Kitty \\"the celebrity\\" friend, and accepts her completely. However, Alice, Nancy's sister, and until recently her best friend, is hostile and suspicious of the relationship between her sister and the performer. With the changing seasons, business falls off and Kitty is on the move. She takes Nancy with her to a newer and bigger gig in London, where our heroine loses her innocence, in more ways than one. Adventure, disillusionment and major heartbreak loom on the horizon for our Nancy - until she finds herself reaching rock bottom. If you don't know what \\"rock bottom,\\" sometimes called \\"the pits,\\" is in Victorian England, you may want to reread Dickens.<br />It takes seven years for Nancy to climb out of the pit she fell into, (or was she pushed?), and fashion a life for herself. Her attempts to earn a living wage are outrageous, fascinating and ingenious. The folks she meets along the way are absolute originals. The take on London's local color, sexual and socialist politics, and social and sexual mores are delicious.<br />Sarah Waters is an extraordinary writer and teller of tales. This is so much more than a book about a woman's sexuality...although sexuality is an important aspect of the novel. Ms. Waters writes about the fight for selfhood and independence in a world where these terms mean little, especially for a female. I just couldn't put this one down and look forward to reading more work by Ms. Waters. I give this my most highly recommended seal of approval!!!gger gig in London, where our heroine loses her innocence, in more ways than one.

This is book #2 of an epic trilogy, a historical romance featuring three warring families: the Drakes, the Espinosas, and the Kendrick-Welles. Set in the Caribbean in the 15th century, it is a tale of extreme betrayal, brutal revenge and hidden treasure, the quest for lost honor, and the hope of new love.<br />\\"Night Shadow\\" is Marcus Drake's story. He is Talon Drake's (\\"My Lord Pirate\\"), younger brother. The two brothers were born of a noble English family on their large island plantation in the Caribbean. Marcus is less secure in himself than Talon. As the younger brother, perhaps finding it hard to measure up to the standards set by his father and older sibling, he got into a bout of rebellious \\"carousing\\" that led to his expulsion from Cambridge. Marcus is also much less at home on the high seas than the other males in his family. He loves the land and prefers farming and estate administration. However, his father did not trust him with much responsibility on the plantation. Then, through a youthful indiscretion on Marcus's part, he inadvertently betrayed a family secret. His entire family, except for Talon and himself, was tortured and brutally murdered as a result. The politics of the time - the sea rivalry between the English and the Spanish, and the treasures of the Spanish Main, helped to further destroy the fortunes of the Drake brothers. They both took to piracy in order to survive, and to  revenge themselves on those who brought them down. Revenge and clearing their name of treason charges has kept them alive through terrible hardships, including years spent in a Spanish dungeon. But throughout, Marcus has lived with the terrible burden that it was his own weakness that destroyed his family.<br />In book #1, Talon and Marcus, escaped the Spanish to adventure and to continue their mission. They were being furiously pursued, with a death penalty hanging over their heads, by Harrison Kendrick, their worst enemy and the man who caused the family's slaughter, and also by Gabriel de Espinosa y Ramirez, \\"El Condor.\\" El Condor is the Almirante of the Spanish fleet and a ruthless pirate hunter. At the end of the first book, Marcus is captured and back in Spanish hands. His brother believes him to be dead.<br />As this novel opens, we find Marcus, once again aboard a Spanish ship and occupying the dungeon. There is a hurricane-like storm, and when most of the Spanish crew is killed or swept overboard Marcus is asked, by none other than El Condor's beautiful sister Liandra, the vessel's most prominent passenger, to Captain the boat and save all of their souls. Also on board is El Condor's little daughter, Christina. Liandra and the remaining Spaniards are terrified that Marcus will discover the identities of Liandra and Christina, and take a terrible revenge. Marcus does indeed find out, but he does not want to harm an innocent young woman and child and have them suffer, as did his own mother and sister. Liandra and Marcus are drawn together in spite of their family histories. She discovers what a kind, brave man he really is. And he sees, in Liandra, a lovely, earthy & quirky, compassionate woman of tremendous courage. Our heroine, who finds herself very much in love with the new ship's Captain, experiences lust for the first time. She certainly does not discourage Marcus from making love to her. In one of the most frustrating love/sex scenes of all time, El Condor-interruptus takes place. Liandra's brother Gabriel and crew capture them at sea and take over their boat...immediately after consummation - that is clinical consummation! Marcus is forced, although he is not unwilling, to marry Liandra to preserve her honor. Gabriel doesn't plan on really welcoming his new brother-in-law to the fold - he knows that Marcus is doomed to die. So the newlyweds are separated - only to be reunited again on the island where Liandra lives. There they have a short time together to discover if they are suited to continue as a couple in thefuture...if, in fact, Marcus lives to have a future. Talon and Marcus are also reunited toward the end of the novel, and Marcus discovers that his sister did survive her brutal attack, so many years ago. And so the adventure(s) continue.<br />This story is filled with excitement, subplots, wonderful characters and humor. Liandra, who is an excellent swordsperson, as well as horseperson, (gender non-specific nouns are definitely not poetic), and she gets to flaunt her stuff.<br />I recommend this book and can't wait to read the last book in the trilogy, \\"The Heart of the Condor.\\"e future...if, in fact, Marcus lives to have a future.

Set in the Caribbean in the 15th century, it is a tale of extreme betrayal, the lust for brutal revenge and hidden treasure, the quest for lost honor, and the hope of new love.<br />\\"My Lord Pirate\\" is Talon Drake's story. He is an almost perfect hero. Not only is he unbelievably handsome, courageous, intelligent, brave, sexy and charming...but he has a strong and ethical code of honor. Talon was born of a noble English family on their large island plantation in the Caribbean. The entire family, except Talon and his brother Marcus, was tortured and brutally murdered through a friend's greed and betrayal. The politics of the time - the sea rivalry between the English and the Spanish, and the treasures of the Spanish Main, helped to further destroy the fortunes of the Drake brothers. They both take to piracy in order to survive. Revenge to those who brought them down, and clearing their family name of treason charges keeps them alive through terrible hardships.<br />Talon attempts to kidnap his enemy's, (Harrison Kendrick), fiancee and winds up with the wrong woman. Regan is as wonderful a heroine as Talon is a hero. She is beautiful, smart, courageous and very non-traditional. Together, the two of them make sparks fly. My major critique of this novel is that Ms. Renkin, in order to maintain tension between Talon and Regan, settles on the hackneyed solution of overdoing the \\"love-hate\\" relationship. There is certainly enough justification for perhaps 50% of the, \\"I love you in the evenings and I hate you in the mornings\\" between the two of them. There is much shared familial baggage that gets in the way of love and friendship. But the back and forth bickering, especially by Regan, who changes her feelings every 8 hours, comes across, (oddly enough), as the author's weakness rather than Regan's. Ms. Renkin's success in building such a strong female figure is also her downfall. When Regan uncharacteristically continues, ad nauseum, to protest too much - her whining and turn-coat behavior is not believable. I am then, as a reader, torn from the story and forced to think, \\"Bad writing!\\" What a disruption!<br />Anyway, we are treated to rough storms at sea, of both the natural and emotional kinds. Regan's cousin Arabella and clan are also captured, crowding the ship with a varied and very entertaining cast of characters. Plots and counter-plots succeed and are also thwarted. And slowly, some of the pieces of the puzzle emerge that show us the broader picture of over 2 generations of the intertwining histories of the families.<br />Of the two Renkin books that I have read so far, this one and its sequel, \\"Night Shadow,\\" I prefer the latter. Each book stands on its own, but I strongly suggest that you read this one first. It is a good book and a good read. I have a feeling that the last two books are the strength of the trilogy and look forward to beginning \\"The Heart Of The Condor.\\"such a strong female figure is also her downfall.

I was also hoping to read more about the fabulous characters that staff Rarities. So, I actually went out and paid full price for a copy of &quot;Running Scared&quot; and dug in for a rainy spring day read.<br />What a disappointment!! This is most definitely not up to par for an Elizabeth Lowell novel. My first thought, after about 50 pages, was that perhaps Ms. Lowell was pressured to meet a strict deadline...or that she had promised too much with this series, and the well went dry. The background research is there, as always. Her detail on Druid gold, the antiquities market and authentication, is meticulous. However, her characters are cardboard. There is little life in them. Risa Sheridan and Shane Tannahill are like collages of former characters, pieced together without much rhyme or reason - a bad paste job! Her secondary characters from Rarities are not nearly as interesting as they were in &quot;Moving Target.&quot; She did not develop them any further in this sequel. The villains are flat, comic book characters. The hackneyed, formulaic plot barely held my interest, and I held in there longer than I should have.<br />I am tempted to give Elizabeth Lowell a free pass on this...as she has given me so much reading pleasure in the past. But then I remember that I paid good money for that past pleasure, and so I wind up feeling cheated with &quot;Running Scared.&quot;	2003-06-11

Once I began this extraordinary book, I could not put it down. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is so much more than a gripping suspense thriller. Dan Brown takes us beyond the main plot and leads us on a quest for the Holy Grail - a Grail totally unlike anything we have been taught to believe. With his impeccable research, Mr. Brown introduces us to aspects and interpretations of Western history and Christianity that I, for one, had never known existed...or even thought about. I found myself, unwillingly, leaving the novel, and time and time again, going online to research Brown's research - only to find a new world of historic possibilities opening up for me. And my quest for knowledge and the answers to questions that the book poses, paralleled, in a sense, the quest of the book's main characters. What a trip! What a read!<br />A violent murder is committed in the Louvre Museum. The museum's chief curator, who is also the head of a remarkable secret society that has existed since the death of Christ, is found dead and gruesomely positioned on the floor near The Mona Lisa. In the minutes before he died, this very complex man was able to leave clues for his daughter to follow. The daughter, a brilliant cryptographer, along with a famed US symbologist, follow her father's codes and leads, hoping that he will, through his death, finally tell her what he wanted to confide in her while he lived.  The secret society included members such as: Leonardo Da Vinci, Boticelli, Gallileo, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, Jean Cocteau, etc. These folks really Did belong to this society, which Really existed! This is when I first began my online search.<br />The mystery, or mysteries, take us through England, France and far back in time. We learn about the secret of the Knights Templar, and the symbolism in many of the world's most treasured paintings, as well as architectural symbolism in some of history's most sacred churches. Of course, we also learn who committed the murder and why - although this is almost secondary next to the real epic mystery the novel uncovers.<br />If there are flaws in the plot, I was too busy reading to discover any. That is probably the sign of a terrific book! The writing is excellent and the characters are a bit on the super-hero/heroine side, but who cares? Is what \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" proposes true? Well, the research is correct. The historical events and people explored in the book are real. But no one knows the Truth...nor will we ever, probably. I think that some things are meant to be a mystery. With all the world's diverse religions and each individual's belief in what is Divine - the  Truth would have to destroy the beliefs, hopes and lives of many of the world's population. So, perhaps, in the divine scheme of things, there are many more Truths than one. Don't take the book too seriously.

This is the fictional account of a very real love affair, told by &quot;the other woman.&quot; The relationship, by itself was not an uncommon one, although the characters could have been created by Edith Wharton. They are east coast, upper-class, elite; patricians to-the-manor-born. It is really not an epic love story like that of Josephine and Napoleon, or Cleopatra and Antony, or even the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Fortunately, for history's sake, no one gave up a throne...or the presidency for this love. The three people who comprise the love triangle, however, are of epic proportion - Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt and Lucy Mercer. And each of these people, as individuals, and in their relationship to one another, had a major role to play in the course of world events, from the time that Lucy met Franklin and Eleanor, just before World War I, through the Great Depression, until the end of Franklin's life, right before the end of World War II.<br />While reading this novel, I initially thought it to be short on substance - more than fluff, but lacking in weight - perhaps it needed more historical detail. But after reading the book, I was left with a feeling of deep sadness at the poignancy of the love that existed between Lucy and Franklin, and between Eleanor and Franklin. Ellen Feldman has given us Lucy's voice, a woman's voice from a time long ago, (for some reason I remember Lily Bart from Edith Wharton's &quot;House of Mirth&quot;). And that voice tells us the history of a love which is the center of her life - so that the history of the world becomes peripheral. And that one historical viewpoint becomes unique and compelling.<br />I admire Ms. Feldmans work tremendously.  I also admire her courage in writing a historical novel of merit about such famous, public figures. So much has been written about them already - yet few have touched on this subject. Ms. Feldman writes beautifully, with a quiet passion and a certain delicacy. Her characters are well drawn and true.<br />There is a quote by Eleanor Roosevelt at the end of the book that moved me very much. She says, &quot;[If you] cannot meet the need of someone whom [you] dearly love...you must learn to allow someone else to meet the need, without bitterness or envy, and accept it.&quot;rs are well drawn and true. <br />There is a quote by Eleanor Roosevelt at the end of the book that moved me very much.

I found myself marking passages in the prose, so I could return to them later and savor them at leisure, without a rapidly moving plot to deter me. It is also a difficult book to read. As with much good literature, it is necessary to concentrate and read every word. This is not a novel that can be skimmed, or speed read. It is definitely not a light read. Filled with symbolism, and allusions to Iranian culture, the Farsi language, ancient poets and older cities, it is the love story of one couple, and the story of a nation in political, cultural and social upheaval. If you read carefully, with patience, the story will unfold for you like a beautiful Isfahani rose.<br />A young Englishman goes to Iran in the mid-1970s. Many young American and European \\"hippies\\" passed through that country, beginning in the late 1960s and continuing through until before the revolution in 1979. Iran was on the way to India, the destination point of many young westerners. The Beatles and other pop stars had made India a mecca for the young with its gurus, cheap drugs, native music, mysticism, etc.. And Persia was a romantic place stop on the way - with its exquisite, impressive countryside, hospitable people, and romantic, gracious and exotic culture. So, John Pitt finds himself in Isfahan, a fairytale of a city. There he meets the enchanting Shrin Farameh. They love. They run away and marry. They struggle to combine cultures and language and to make a world for themselves amidst the chaos and political nightmare that is pre-revolution Iran. Their marriage also carries with it tremendous political & personal consequences. But I won't go there now and spoil one of the more enticing aspects of the plot. Suffice it to say, that the couple is violently & tragically separated. Following the separation, comes suffering that could read like a chapter out of Job. But John is never deterred from his mission to reunite with his wife and the daughter he barely had time to know.<br />I lived in Iran from 1965 until 1968, and \\"The Persian Bride\\" brought so much of my experience back to me.

This story of Daniel Mulloney, begins when he is a man in his mid-twenties. \\"Paper Roses\\" is the story of his adopted sister, Evie, with whom he was raised. But Daniel's boyhood and adolescence are featured prominently in the 1st novel, as are the adventures he almost always shares with his sister, and much information about the formation of his character. So, if you begin this book after reading its prequel, you feel like you are meeting an old friend and catching up on what has happened since you last heard from him. And, there is much about the character of Daniel Mulloney that is only revealed in book #1 - book #2 is more plot-driven.<br />Daniel was raised by a nanny who was paid for her services. His family abandoned him to her care when it was discovered he was born lame. The family obviously is a wealthy one, as Daniel was brought up to live as a gentleman, in post-Civil War St. Louis, Missouri. All his bills and his education were paid for by check, from the Mulloney family lawyer to the servant. Daniel grew up hurt and somewhat embittered that he had been so carelessly discarded. And he always wondered about his parents and extended family. When the nanny dies, Daniel goes to Texas with his adopted sister, and grows to manhood, surviving numerous adventures, including blowing up a small Texas town. He is a handsome, intelligent, witty and sensitive man with an interest in journalism and the desire to finally find out about his roots.<br />On his way to Cutlerville, Ohio, (home of the Mulloney clan), he meets a young heiress on the train. Georgina Hanover is an extroverted, mischievous and very attractive young woman, who goes after what she wants. What she does Not want is to marry her fiance, Peter Mulloney, heir to a fortune in his own right...and brother to Daniel. She would like to help Daniel start up a newspaper in Cutlerville and begin his journalistic crusade for workers' rights. The primary exploiter of workers and women in Cutlerville is Daniel's father - the one who abandoned him at birth. Go figure!<br />This is a terrific story, but it does not compare to \\"Paper Roses,\\" which is one of my favorite books. \\"Paper Roses\\" is almost epic in its scope - involving many characters and various plots, subplots and themes. \\"Paper Tiger\\" is a terrific tale, but much less complex and ambitious - and less compelling too. As always, Patricia Rice creates characters that are realistic and 3-dimensional. Her take on social reform, journalism and photography in mid-19th century America, creates an interesting environment for her characters and is also great for plot development. Her humor is ever present. I recommend this book, on its own merit...but if you can, read \\"Paper Flowers\\" first.

Lovely Lily Lawson was jilted as a young debutante because she was too intelligent, too independent, too much of everything to ever fit the description of a demure, passive Regency deb. She did attempt an obedient, maidenly facade with her fiance, but her bubbly nature bubbled over, and she lost him. Brokenhearted, she left England with her wealthy maiden Aunt Sally to travel on the Continent. While in Italy, Lily was seduced by an Italian scoundrel. After a regrettable night of painful, humiliating and totally passionless sex, she vowed off men and sex as an impediment to her life, as she would live it. Then she discovered that she carried a bambino - a souvenir from her Italian stallion. Her aunt, from whom she must have inherited most of her gene pool, was delighted and reassured Lily that they would live their lives in a villa in Italy - a perfect family of three.<br />Complications arose after the beautiful baby, Nicole, was born. Aunt Sally died, Nicole was kidnapped, Lily was blackmailed for lots of money to insure the safety of her daughter, and she had to return to London to be able to make the money she needed. Now, Lily gambles, almost nightly, at her Cockney friend's infamous gambling club, the only woman permitted to do so - and has a seemingly endless lucky streak. She is called Lawless Lily for her reckless ways; wildly riding in breeches to the hunt, drinking, cardplaying, etc. Ironically she is supposed to have had many lovers - in truth, there has been only one, once...and that was plenty for her.<br />Lily's younger sister Penelope is engaged to marry the arrogant Earl of Wolverton, in a loveless, arranged match. Lily, determined to save her sister so she can marry the man she loves, marches to the rescue...and the many and varied clashes between our heroine and the arrogant, but sizzlingly hot and handsome Earl begin. He matches her every move, but she won't play submissive to his dominant alpha male behavior. So he tries tenderness, kindness, soft sensuality...Wow!~! So...Does she change her mind about men? You have to read the book.<br />This book and its sequel \\"Dreaming Of You\\" are two of my favorite Lisa Kleypas novels.

This tall, blonde bombshell has just skipped bail and is running from a charge of armed robbery - that she didn't commit. The evidence against her, the crime weapon and the stolen money found in the back seat of her car, couldn't be more damning. She is also fleeing the 300 pound, gonzo-looking bounty hunter who is chasing her. No one, not even her court appointed attorney, believes she is innocent. Renee, who has a long juvenile rap sheet, has tried for eight years to overcome her past. She has just received a much earned promotion to Assistant Manager at Tolosa, Texas's only 4 star restaurant & instead of a bright future, she is facing 10 years in jail. The idea of 24 hours behind bars, let alone years, gives her paralyzing panic attacks. So she runs.<br />Eluding the bounty hunter, (a hilarious escapade), on foot, sans car, Renee runs into a roadside diner & propositions the first man she sees - a 30-something, hunky, single cop on vacation & dining out. She promises him the wildest night of sex he's ever known if they can just go to his place - not hers -  ASAP! How can he refuse ? It was a boring vacation anyway.<br />Thus begins an adventure, mystery romance that will knock your socks off...as my grandmother used to say. Ms. Graves writes wonderfully well, her characters are over the top & her humor will have you laughing out loud. Plus, the romance is Steamy.<br />If you are a fan of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, you will love Jane Graves' Renee Esterhaus. The two writers, Evanovich & Graves, have different styles, but their heroines - strong, gutsy, self-made women - have much in common. I absolutely loved this book and highly recommend it.	2003-06-05

Her first novel, \\"Mathilda,\\" is beloved by most who can read. Ms. Fielding has traveled to London to research the underworld of gambling for her latest book. Venturing into the London stews late one evening, and taking copious notes on Cockney street cant, local color and any noteworthy incidents that might add flavor to her fiction, Sara inadvertently witnesses and interrupts a violent stabbing. She pulls out the pistol she carries for protection, (target-shooting at home in Greenwood Corners is a necessary hobby, obviously). She shoots one of the attackers, meaning only to wound, while another escapes. Thus, 25 year old Sara Fielding saves the life of Derek Craven.<br />Mr. Craven is the fabulously wealthy owner of London's most exclusive gambling club. He is a self-made man and wheels and deals with the most powerful people in England. In a world where knowledge is power, he has knowledge of exactly how much money the wealthy and landed possess; who owes what to whom; who is on the verge of bankruptcy, etc.. Craven was born destitute, however, and his prostitute mother abandoned him soon after the birth. Pimps, prostitutes & criminals raised him in the darkest of city slums, & he managed to survive by becoming as ruthless as he needed to be. Cynicism is Mr. Craven's middle name and money is what he believes in. Any tender feelings or emotions he might have had, or hoped to have, he buried deep inside of himself where they can never be found. Love is weakness and weakness is to be despised. Get the picture? So, Derek has little patience for anyone or anything that does not serve his ends. I might add here, for the sake of us romance readers...yes, he also happens to be handsome and a hunk, in a rough, virile sort of way. :) Anyway, he does owe Sara his life...& he is Mr. Gambling King...and she is doing research on gambling...so they get to hang out! Yes, her lovely innocence gets to him...although he resists mightily. And the adventures begin, as does a most wonderful love story.<br />Both Derek and Sara are fabulous characters, and more complex than I can begin to describe. Sara is a riot doing research after midnight in the most horrible neighborhoods you can imagine. Derek is so tough and so determined not to feel anything, EVER! There is a lively cast of \\"others\\", plot twists, humor, and super, steamy sex.<br />I truly don't know how Lisa Kleypas does it.

I certainly give Marjorie Fasman 5 stars for trying, but her \\"Diary Of Henry Fitzwilliam Darcy\\" is a stilted attempt at portraying the heart of the hero. I am most definitely not a Jane Austen purist, or any other kind, although Ms. Austen is one of my favorite authors. By all means, Be Creative...and if it works, Bravo! As someone who loves \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and the novel's rich characters, I say bring on sequel after sequel, if they will enable me to read more about Mr. Darcy, his Elizabeth, et. al. But I have to be able to believe that these characters live & breathe, as they do in Ms. Austen's book. This novel cum diary doesn't quite make the grade. Ms. Fasman's Darcy has not a breath of life in him. Perhaps the diary format, with its relatively brief entries, overly simplifies Mr. Darcy's all too complex character. I need more meat on the bones and a heart that beats - Ms. Fasman gives me fluff. Am I too demanding? I don't expect another \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" But if I am going to read a book about H.F. Darcy, I want to find his character in the book and not just a caricature.<br /><br />There are superficial attempts to demonstrate that Darcy had a life before meeting The Bennett family. We learn that he was raised by a cold, undemonstrative mother, a father who was rarely home, and a series of nannies, tutors, etc. We get a few entries on school experiences at Harrow and Cambridge. But the characters are cardboard, the relationships hollow, and the life experience of this man, which is what he supposedly is when he meets Elzabeth Bennett, is very limited. I have read much about the time period in which Ms. Austen wrote, and men of Mr. Darcy's station, character & potential are usually much more worldly. Certainly Ms. Austen's Darcy would have taken the Grand Tour, or if the wars were in the way, he would probably have traveled elsewhere. Though he would have been exempt from military service, as the oldest son & heir, I cannot imagine Darcy not writing about the war, & perhaps his feelings about not participating in the military adventure of his time. Certainly he would have done some minor carousing or rebelling, (he Is human & did experience an adolescence). Where is his first love interest or infatuation? Is Darcy interested in politics, societal reform...something besides Pemberly? Ms. Fasman neither fleshes out her character nor gives him much depth. He comes to his meeting with Lizzy, almost her equal in life experience, in many ways, almost as innocent, but much more prideful. I do not see this man as a match for our Elizabeth. I expect the REAL Mr. Darcy is a more worldly, though a restrained & perhaps a repressed man. He is quite intelligent, & has many more interests and pursuits than managing his estate, reading, swordplay, horses and dogs - Ms. Fasman just doesn't tell us what these are. Ms. Austen's Darcy is a man who has a bit more of a handle on the world he lives in, a more experienced & knowledgeable man than Ms. Fasman's Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />I also want to comment on the stilted language that so negatively impacts the believability of the storyline. An example: \\"I stole a glance at the maiden expecting to find her undone and sobbing...\\" Did people speak like this in Mr. Darcy's 19th century society? Ms. Austen's never gave her readers reason to think so. Ms. Bennett may be a maiden, although she would probably be called a young woman. However she is too strong a figure, too intelligent & active, to be a mate for the Henry Fitzwilliam Darcy portrayed in this diary.<br />JANAwar, & perhaps his feelings about not participating in the military adventure of his time.

A young woman, born on the wrong side of the blanket &amp; raised in wealth by a nanny, is subsidized by the mother who wants to remain anonymous. Although raised with love by the servant, she is traumatized by the knowledge &amp; stigma of her illegitimacy. She begins a search for her family roots after the nanny dies. Evie is an extremely intelligent, well-educated, very beautiful young woman - however she has a powerful imagination, fired by her love of literature &amp; fiction, &amp; a tendency to live in a dream-world. She hires a man she believes to be a famous gunfighter to escort her safely to Texas from post-Civil War St. Louis, Missouri. The &quot;gunfighter&quot; is a notorious, womanizing, gambler &amp; though he is an expert marksman, he is definitely not the man Evie believes him to be - a hero she picked out of a penny novel. Tyler Monteigne, in fact has some serious traumas of his own. His family was killed during the War, their plantation in Louisiana lost to carpetbaggers, &amp; he was a prisoner of war in a Yankee prison camp for 3 years.<br />Tyler agrees to accompany Evie, along with some other very colorful &amp; well-defined characters, to Texas. He is a hunk. She is sooo sassy. Together they ignite. Very Steamy! These are more than cardboard, formulaic characters. Ms. Rice has worked to populate her novel with 3-D people, lots of humor &amp; sensitivity. There are wonderful plots &amp; sub-plots - and a beautiful &amp; realistic love story.<br />What a great book! I could not put it down. The writing is intelligent &amp; witty. I love strong heroes...but I like strong heroines more - especially back in the days when a woman had to fight extra hard for her independence &amp; individuality. This one's a keeper.<br />PS - This is book #1 of a series. I look forward to reading books 2 &amp; 3, &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; &amp; &quot;Paper Moon.&quot;	2003-06-04

This is an \\"unputdownable\\" love story, taut with suspense, filled with passion and romance...and also a unique tale of time-travel. Lisa Kleypas certainly outdoes herself with this novel.<br />Addie Peck, an orphan, raised by her beloved Aunt Leah, is 20 years old. She is an independent, caring young woman, a hardworking nurse, yet a bit of a flapper in 1930s, Sunrise, Texas. She & her aunt have worked and scrimped very hard to survive in this time of The Great Depression. Now her aunt is dying of cancer. Addie is trying to face a new life, a future alone, in a town where she has never felt she belonged. She has many suitors but has never loved except for her aunt, and, of course the parents she cannot remember. She has a recurring dream of a dark, mysterious stranger who comes to her at night and loves her passionately. She feels that, whoever he is, wherever he is, they belong together - she wants to be with him in reality. She also has a frightening dream of an old man with green eyes who stares at her and whispers, \\"Adeline. Adeline, where have you been?\\"<br />Aunt Leah had often told Addie tales of their family history. She talked about her own grandfather, Addie's great-grandfather, Russell Warner. Warner was a self-made man and owned a large and thriving cattle ranch in Sunrise in the 1880s. He was murdered when Leah was just 10 years old. The murderer had never been caught. The prime suspect was Warner's right-hand man, Ben Hunt, a handsome cowboy, foreman, and a transplanted Harvard man. (a REALLY smart cowboy! :)) He left the ranch after Russell Warner died. Then there was Adeline Warner, Russell's favorite child, and the one most like him...even though she was a daughter. She was beautiful, looked just like Addie, her namesake, but unlike Addie she was spoiled and selfish. She disappeared mysteriously a few months before her father's death, and no one ever heard from her again or discovered any information about her. Caroline, Leah's mother and Adeline's older sister, left Texas with her husband and daughter and resettled in North Carolina. Her mother and brother went with them, always preferring the refinements of the East to the wild Texan ways. And the once grand ranch died. Only Leah returned to Sunrise, Texas, to live out her adult years and raise her niece.<br />Then, the night before Leah's death, a stranger comes to the small town of Sunrise. He is an old man with remarkable bottle-green eyes. And he can't keep his eyes off of Addie. I won't spoil this extraordinary story for you by telling more.

The incumbent, a man of strong principles, is a major NASA supporter. His opponent, who is basing his campaign on turning NASA into a private, non-governmental agency, thus saving the US taxpayer billions of dollars annually, is way up in the polls. He is also accepting enormous illegal campaign contributions from private aerospace companies who have billions to gain from the privatization of NASA. After many failures & much spending, NASA is badly in need of a success.<br />Then a NASA satellite detects a large, high-density rock buried 200 feet below the Milne Ice Shelf on Ellesmere Island, high in the Arctic Circle. NASA scientists determine the rock to be a meteor containing fossils proving that life exists elsewhere in the universe.<br />To verify the authenticity of the find, the White House sends a team of independent experts to the NASA habisphere, built over the meteor in the Arctic Circle. One of these experts is the intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton, the daughter of Senator Sedgewick Sexton. Senator Sexton is the man running for election against the President of the United States.

Janet Evanovich's \\"One For The Money\\" is an exceptional mystery cum romance, with extraordinary humor, (guaranteed to brighten the darkest mood), and originality. Once I began to read this book, the first in a series, I could not put it down.<br />Stephanie Plum, our heroine, is down on her luck, unemployed, divorced, sans money and car & culturally-challenged, being born and raised in Trenton, New Jersey. Hey, I'm originally from NJ, so I am allowed to say that! She does have the option to move back in with her parents, but the very thought of going home again causes her eyes to twitch uncontrollably. Steph's cousin Vinnie, an easily blackmailable sex maniac, owns a bail bonding company. Stephanie \\"persuades\\" him to hire her as a bounty hunter, novice that she is. Her first job - Joseph Morelli, who is FTA, Failed To Appear...he's skipped bail!<br />Now, Joseph Morelli, a sexy hunk and ex-cop, on the run from a murder charge, and our Stephanie have a history that goes way back to childhood. When she was six years old and the precocious Morelli was just a few years older, he taught her to play \\"choo-choo\\" in the Morelli garage. When she was 16 she lost her virginity to Morelli on the floor of the Tasty Pastry Bakery, after working hours, and then didn't see him again for 3 years. When she finally did see him, 36 months later, hanging on the corner of Giovichinni's Meat Market, she ran him over with her father's Buick. He lived to tell the tale.<br />Ms. Evanovich also introduces us to a cast of wonderfully outrageous characters who continue to populate her subsequent books: Ranger, a 2nd generation Cuban American, ex-Special Forces, creative genius of a bounty hunter...and also very hunky, especially when wearing his all black outfit with leather accessories; Ramirez, a psychopathic prize fighter who is too scary to be much fun; Grandma Mazur, Stephanie's maternal grandmother, and a pistol-packin,' roller blading clotheshorse she is! Fortunately, she is probably the majority contributor to Stephanie's gene pool; Lula, a 250 pound-plus hooker, who aspires to be a bounty hunter & is working on her resume; etc.<br />And of course there's the mystery...because this is a mystery. But I won't spoil that for you. Just run to your local library, bookstore...or Amazon.com, of course, & get this chock-full of great reading gem of a book. Also, beware!!

I strongly disagree with the reviewers who claim there is little or no plot to this wonderful tale of 2 strangers; a somewhat naive but intelligent young woman &amp; her hired travel guide, a hardened gunfighter, who both seek the same man for different reasons. Boring, never!! Romantic, absolutely!<br />Their journey across the Colorado Rockies, with the woman's prized Arabian horses in tow, is wonderfully descriptive &amp; full of adventure &amp; hardship. While the plot is not particularly complex, I found it to be an enjoyable account of a long &amp; arduous journey. It also provides a framework for the portraits of the 2 protagonists. The characters of this extraordinary woman &amp; man, &amp; the development of their relationship, make reading this book worthwhile. Willow Moran is bright, spirited, couragous &amp; caring. Caleb Black may be obsessed with revenge, but he is also a man with a stong sense of integrity &amp; a very sweet &amp; tender side. Both of them together are dynamite!<br />I like Caleb &amp; Willow as human beings, complex &amp; out of the ordinary. And I loved reading about the Arabian horses...an added plus.
