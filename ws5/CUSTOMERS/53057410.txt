Lawson does not seem very favorably disposed to those she describes.  She describes some who behave rather badly (killing their children in some cases). <br /> There's always been a problem with psychiatric diagnoses that we cannot confirm by blood tests or X-rays. The \\"borderline personality\\" diagnosis is especially fuzzy. It fits anyone who is selfish and over-emotional.  Lawson stretches the diagnosis to include a number of well-known personalities she has never met, and blurs the edges even more. She adds a typology of her own; the waif, the queen, the witch and the hermit. These are just off the top of her head and are not validated by any kind of statistics or experimental work.  When she does mention anything about brain chemistry or anatomy or about medication it's in passing, and some of it is wrong.  <br /> The ways of managing such mothers she suggests are more in the nature of advice for their children (often quite good advice) than proven methods of therapy. <br /> The quality of the writing is excellent. The author knows how to tell a story and keep the pages turning. I'm sure many will read it and recognize situations or people they have encountered, as we do when we read a good novel. This is closer to imaginative literature than to science, but it's very good imaginative literature. <br />	2005-10-12

There are no preplaced clues and the villain's identity is revealed shortly before the end by an implausible coincidental meeting.  The murder method shows ignorance of the most rudimentary toxicology.  <br />Authors of novels with academic settings can also be forgiven for weak plots if they give us sparkling erudition .and witty dialog but this is a  novel where people \\"smile ruefully\\" mutter to themselves in complete sentences, and address each other in long unlikely speeches containing such phrases as \\"mark my words.\\" Adverbs and clichs abound.  On one page, genuinely chosen at random, are: <br />\\"hastened to say\\" <br />\\"turned towards her with concern' <br />\\"can't be too careful\\" <br />\\"as you might expect\\" <br />\\"a kind of hysteria\\" <br />\\"paused a moment\\" <br />\\"cut in firmly.\\" <br /> The only erudition is about feminist theology and college finances. One character quotes Plato in Greek. It's about the best line in the book. The authors are both heads of colleges. Do not their institutions have elementary courses in creative writing or pharmacology? <br />	2005-10-04

On the whole it was readable and enjoyable.  <br />The main interest is the Hawaiian setting, and the descriptions of inter-racial tensions there are illuminating, but the Hawaiian setting is insufficiently exotic in and of itself to make a dramatic impact.If we are reading an account of a childhood because it is remote and bizarre we expect Tibet or Timbuctu.  We also look for some conflict - some adversity to be overcome, such as the disfigurement in \\"Autobiography of a Face\\" or the poverty in \\"Angela's Ashes\\" -  and this childhood, in the late sixties and early seventies, sounds rather pleasant and privileged. Getting into college and who to invite to the prom are major crises.  <br />The strongest plot concerns the narrator's two previous generations and is treated only as back story. The best character is his grandmother, a native Hawaiian who bore two children out of wedlock, farmed them out to relatives, and acquired and worked a ranch on which she installed her lovers.  She disappears from the book early on, and we are left with a series of anecdotes of childhood and adolescence.  These include long descriptions  of fist fights and basketball games and a succession of unconsummated crushes.  The episodes are hung together by the fact that they concern the same narrator.  Only two or three of them are vivid enough to stand alone as stories. <br /> I do not always demand strong plots. The slightest of plots can be redeemed by great dialog and characterization.  There are some snippets of bright speech but Wright sometimes records banal exchanges for no particular reason. For example: <br />\\"That's a good-looking thoroughbred\\" said Mr Kristofferson... <br />\\"That's Sparkling Eyes\\" said my father. <br />\\"Your girls are such graceful riders,\\" my mother commented. <br />\\"They just adore your beautiful horses,\\" said Mrs Kristofferson. <br />	2005-09-20

He was a man of massive and varied achievements who lied about his achievements. He had flown, as navigator, on 38 missions over Japanese held territory. He was an accomplished musician and athlete, an expert on French literature, a major poet and a major best-selling novelist. <br />Hart does not quite give us the answer to the puzzle, and perhaps none is possible. It is an old theory (one often used to explain Hemmingway) that the jock who exaggerates his masculinity is reacting against a fear of  effeminacy. Some of Dickey's life, and much of his work fits in with that theory. Simple alchohol and a writer's fertile imagination account for a lot. <br />At 751 pages I found it rather too long and felt about it the way Samuel Johnson felt about Paradise Lost.  There are a lot of day-by-day passages about where Dickey was on what particular date that I found mind-numbing, but I suppose the conscientious writer of what will probably be the only biography had to pack everything in. <br />The book is an interesting source of information about the literary scene of the sixties, seventies and eighties. Hart seems familiar with the life and work of practically every English language poet of those eras  <br />He is evidently less familiar with the Greek iambic poets; a scurrilous and quarrelsome bunch. He misattributes the only well-known quotation from their best-known member, Archilochus of Paros (a touchy man who lied about his war record and abused women). <br />One of Dickey's many skills was as a navigator. He liked to use a sextant. I wonder if his services should have been called upon by the captain of the ship that took him to Europe when \\"On February 13 Dickey watched the New York skyline recede behind the gray waters of Long Island Sound.\\"  (But perhaps he enjoyed the extra ride up the East River). <br />  <br />	2005-09-16

This is an excellent book, and one that should be read by anyone who deals with overweight children, as teacher, parent, physician or psychologist.  It is well written, with many instructive and poignant vignettes. <br /> Having said that, there are some negatives.  The central dilemma in helping the overweight child is a conflict between making the child feel better and making the child thinner. The track record of treatments to make them thinner is poor. Sometimes they work but they involve convincing the child of how desirable it is to be thin. The more convinced the child becomes of the desirability of thinness the worse it feels. Rimm touches on this problem in her earlier chapters, especially in describing her argument with her son the epidemiologist, but does not resolve the issue. <br />Cigarettes, marihuana and alcohol are barely mentioned. This may be because of her  of her focus in the earlier chapters on her own important and groundbreaking work, which was with middle schoolers.  <br />I did not think the chapters on treatment were truly evidence-based although she has many good and useful ideas. She relies on secondary sources and on intuition  and anecdotal evidence.  It is presumably outside her stated purpose to offer specific dietary recommendations, but she does, in fact, make some suggestions.  She might as well have gone the whole hog (sorry) and provided diet sheets rather than scientifically dubious and half-hearted tips about eating three meals a day and \\"healthy snacks.\\"    <br /> The use of diet pills is not mentioned. These seem to be taboo for writers on pediatric weight problems, even though the same medications are widely prescribed to make naughty children behave better (with growth stunting regarded as an unwanted side effect). <br />	2005-08-24

McMullen has an interesting style that some may find irritating but I rather enjoyed. At times he uses orotund and convoluted sentences reminiscent of Gibbon or Samuel Johnson. At other times he lapses into the first person and uses contractions and old-fashioned slang such as \\"argy-bargy.\\"  It is rather like listening to conversation over the port in the Senior Common room of some ancient college.  <br /> I was irritated by the references.  These occupy a large part of the book and are grouped as end-notes (Gibbon had footnotes).  They often give only a single name of author without date or place of publication.  If you track down the author in the bibliography (which is separate) you often still don't get anywhere, even if you remember where in the text you started off.  Sometimes the references contain references.   <br />The question of which festivals and folk customs represent survivals of pre-Christian religions is more complex than he acknowledges.  It's better dealt with by Ronald Hutton in \\"Pagan religions of the Ancient British Isles.\\" <br />I've always been intrigued by the names of the days of the week in Indo-European languages.

That led me to expect some impeccable prose, penetrating insights, and sly wit.  After getting the book from Amazon, my first sample of the prose style was in the blurb. \\"He is led down a tangled and sometimes uncompromising road of emotions.\\" \\"The end result culminates in a series of remembrances, nightmares, and flashbacks...\\" <br /> Being of a charitable disposition (and having paid for the book) I assumed that the illiteracy was the publisher's, or perhaps part of an elaborate spoof, and went ahead to open the pages.   <br />There are a few nice descriptive passages but these are separated by tracts of exposition, such as \\"Then there was the empty hollow sensation that often accompanies another's demise, and in a case such as this, the feeling that one somehow has to make up that vacant feeling to the world.\\" Such writing may have been in the mind of the reviewer in The Southern Scribe\\" who described it tactfully as \\"rich in complexity ...not for the faint-hearted.\\" <br />An African-American housekeeper expresses herself in such terms as \\"I don't know child. White peoples sho do some strange things if you ask me\\" and \\"Lord have mercy. Looks like yo' daddy done come home.\\" <br />The humor includes such gems as \\"She set the wedge of cheese down with the fork sticking upward out of it like some modern sculpture found in front of a Manhattan office building - a usual attempt to draw one's attention away from the fact that the building's design is totally lacking in imagination.\\" We are told that a house plant \\"suffered an untimely demise.\\"  Capote would have died. <br />	2005-08-19

The honest truth is that there's no way to prevent childhood obesity and it's none of the government's business anyway, but that's not what government committees are paid to say.<br />It is fairly obvious that they were further restricted because there some other things they were not supposed to say.  One obvious factor is the change in the ethnic makeup of the United States. The magnitude of this factor can be assessed from the tables and graphs. They point out that childhood obesity is largely associated these days in the United States with poverty. They then provide a table showing that over 35 billion dollars a year are spent by the Federal Government giving food to the poor.<br />There are some suggestions they were not allowed to make, such as the use of medications, although enormous numbers of kids are on Ritalin type drugs, which keep them short and skinny as well as better behaved.<br />The question of height is shortchanged. Changes in stature of the average American over years are simply not mentioned.  For many years Americans grew taller and taller and no action was called for to thwart the tallness epidemic. We do not know why the same food intake and energy output that makes one child grow vertically makes another grow horizontally.<br />The decline in smoking over the years is not considered as a causative factor. Birth weight issues are barely mentioned.  (They were not supposed to recommend people smoking or having low birth weight babies).<br />They pay lip-service to evidence-based medicine (a fashionable mantra) but evidence based medicine demands that we consider the adverse effects of any measure.Exercise is regarded as an unalloyed benefit, with no mention that any child may find it uncomfortable, anxiety-producing or embarrassing. They recommend weighing children in school. The experimental studies they mention all show that school physical educations has no effect on childhood obesitybut they support increasing it.<br /> Perhaps it is fortunate that the weight-reducing measures proposed are likely to be ineffective. If they really worked they would, presumably, be equally applied to all children and would make some of the thinner ones undesirably thin.<br /> Some of the sentences convey useful information such as \\"Everyone needs to eat food and consume beverages for daily sustenance.\\" (bet you didn't know that until they told you). There's a very helpful glossary containing definitions of such esoteric words as \\"disease\\" \\"health\\" \\"risk\\" and  \\"prevention\\"  that you might not know the meaning of. The authors themselves are unfamiliar with the word \\"we.\\"  They refer to themselves throughout in the third person as \\"the committee.\\"<br />Even with the aid of the glossary it's sometimes difficult to make any sense of sentences written in dense Washingtonian such as \\"The tension between stigmatization and normalization can be addressed, as it has been for other public health concerns, by focusing on the behaviors that can be changed to promote health rather than on the individual and his or her appearance.\\"  I look forward to the English translation.	2005-08-09

Her special talent is to highlight the absurdities of everyday life and the eccentricities of ordinary people without overstepping into Donald Barthelme fantasy.  Hers is the craziness of the mundane and the comedy of the tragic. Her only other book is \\"How I Came West and Why I Stayed\\" and there's been nothing I know of from her in the last nine years, unless she's the same Alison Baker who wrote \\"The Impact of Filtration Techniques on Chlorophyll Determinations\\" (which does sound possible now I think of it ).  <br /> I got least out of \\"Almost Home\\" but that may be because I always find the novella an irritating length.  Also the impact of Alison Baker's wonderful opening sentences gets lost when a story is too long.  <br />It's 80 pages about a guy whose son has been killed and who has left his wife to live in the woods and commune with something or other. He does encounter a number of Alison Baker type people and animals (a homesick grizzly bear, an intrusive rooster, a bad cat, an elusive cougar, a runaway dog) but I thought the hand of Raymond Carver was heavy and there was too much fine writing like \\"soggy seedheads of last summer's fireweed and thistle\\" that uses botanical erudition to give a spurious air of exactitude.(Can you see that seedheads are soggy though a pair of binoculars?) <br />	2005-08-02

The stories, all published after 1900, are arranged in order of the dates of birth of their writers. The first is Max Beerbohm (born 1872) and the latest Mark Helprin (born 1947). There is no James Joyce and no science fiction.  There is only one French writer (Colette) and one Italian (Dino Buzzati). Publication date is 1989. <br />There are brief introductions with a potted biography of each writer.  Some of them are remarkably unperceptive and wooden. <br />Isaac Bashevis Singer's  wonderfully comic story  of a girl's revolt against stifling  orthodoxy \\"The Dead Fiddler\\" is introduced as a tale of the supernatural.  Well, sure, supernatural is what Liebe Yentl had the people of Shidlovtse believing, and maybe believed herself. ( Pearl Abraham resurrected Liebe Yentl in Rockland County in  \\"The Romance Reader\\"). <br />Raymond Carver's \\"A Small Good Thing\\" is introduced without a word about the controversy over its editing, or about Carver's original ending, which some people prefer. <br />The only writer whose sexual orientation is mentioned is Mishima. Thus Somerset Maugham's \\"The Facts of Life\\" is introduced as a story \\"so clear the reader's intelligence may feel insulted.\\"  I think any high school student reading the story these days (if any does) would ponder over the misogyny, the male bonding, and the father's deep affection that \\"he did all he could not to show\\"  for the son with  \\"blue eyes with long dark lashes\\" and \\"full red mouth \\" whom he could \\"hardly keep his eyes off.\\"    <br /> Collections like this have some usefulness as samplers, as instant cultural literacy.  They can introduce us to writers we might have missed.  They can give us a sample of writers we have heard about but never got round to reading at full length.  For browsing purposes like that I thought is suffered from including some that were too long. The Cortazar story for example is18 pages and I did not finish it. <br />	2005-07-24

It begins with him setting out to solve the mystery of who killed a neighbor's dog, although that is relatively soon solved and we are drawn into the absorbing tale of his relations with his parents.  In many ways it is funny, but I don't think Mark Haddon can be accused of ridiculing the mentally ill. The humor is often in the illogical reactions of those around Christopher.  Christopher is strictly logical, and is some kind of mathematical genius. The text is interpolated with problems in mathematics and logic that Christopher likes to solve.  I'm still puzzling over some of them.  Christopher often sounds morally and intellectually superior in some way to those around him, although their fury at him sounds utterly plausible and is expressed in wonderfully realistic demotic dialog. One of the reasons the dialog sounds so realistic is that it is transcribed by Christopher into perfectly grammatical and correctly spelled English. He nails every character perfectly.  The literary merit and entertainment value is beyond question. A question that does arise is whether this is an authentic insight into the thought processes of an emotionally disturbed child. Christopher is presumably meant to be the kind of  child who used to get labelled as mentally retarded  but shows areas of high intellectual ability. Terms such as \\"idiot savant\\" used to be used and then Kanner introduced \\"autism.\\" It is sometimes suggested that this is the childhood version of schizophrenia. \\"Asperger's syndrome\\" syndrome is often used (although what Asperger described was somewhat different).     I couldn't answer the question as regards Christopher but the tormented efforts of the adults in Christopher's to deal with the situations he creates certainly have the ring of authenticity.	2005-07-11

They experience smoking, drinking, sex, anorexia, self-mutilation, anaphylactic shock and accidental death.   <br />  They form friendships and enmities (mostly the latter) and play cruel tricks on each other. Nobody is ever happy. <br />Much of the writing is excellent, and I got hooked into reading it by the vivid opening description of a long monotonous drive in a bumpy van.   <br /> It's been compared to Lord of the Flies, but LOTF raises the interesting question of what society children would make without adult intervention and marches relentlessly to a gripping climax.  These children have adults around, but all of them are stupid or malevolent or unperceptive.  Such teachers and parents do exist of course, but these are never made plausible because we are never shown why they behave as they do. The story is told from the POV of four of the girls and the adults are only described from the children's perspective.  It's rather like reading a series of those blogs and chat groups that infest the Internet.  The result is that ultimately it's rather plotless, without over-riding conflict or resolution. <br />	2005-06-29

This is third in the series.  <br />The official main plot concerns a rather run-of-the-mill sadistic serial killer with a bad childhood and a renegade Rumanian with one of those suitcases full of plutonium that every other thriller character seems to tote. <br />The sub-plot is much better. Munch Mancini is struggling to make a go of her limo business and worried about retaining her custody of Asia.  She tries to help her old friend Ellen from her drug/alcohol days to get clean.   <br />It's wrong of me but I found Munch Mancini at her most interesting in \\"No Human Involved\\" before she became respectable. (I shouldn't really feel bad.  She's a fictional character).Whenever a scene is written from much Mancini's or Ellen's point of view the writing improves. It's an odd effect. It's not just that they are better drawn characters, but the prose become clunky and clich-ridden and the scene-setting is perfunctory and conventional when the POV changes. We get passages like \\"the last thing the city fathers wanted was reports of a maniac killing women inside their own homes.\\" A terrific car chase at the end.  <br />	2005-06-27

Natalie Robins gives us (at what must have been , judging from her bibliography, an enormous cost in sweated research) three books for the price of one.    The first is a biography of Royal Copeland; the second a history of the relationships between a variety of ancillary health professionals and regular MD's; the third is an investigation of the current standing of homeopathy.  I enjoyed the biography best. Some of the life goes out of the book when Copeland dies (on page 218, in 1938).  He was a figure straight out of Sinclair Lewis, nave in some ways but able to manipulate people and get ahead. He qualified as a homeopathic physician from a mid-western diploma mill.  His energy and chutzpah brought him to make it big in New York City and rise to the United States Senate, founding New York Medical College and writing a medical advice column for William Randolph Hearst.  Much about his pronouncements and statements was unintentionally comic. Robins cleverly lets him speak for himself.  The text is peppered with his wondrous medical claims and hilarious pictures. (The descriptions of his ophthalmic procedures are messed up - it's needling not \\"kneedling\\" that was done for cataracts).  The explanation of the varying relationships over the years between doctors of medicine, homeopaths, osteopaths,  naturopaths, chiropractors, podiatrists, optometrists, herbalists, acupuncturists, etcetera,  and of their different qualifications was the clearest I've ever seen.  Evaluating the claims of these various practitioners obviously treads on touchy ground, and whether she does a fair job of it will be a matter of the reader's opinion, but she is able to make it entertaining as well as instructive.	2005-06-21

I found this a page-turner with good dialog and strong plotting. Although the characters are believable they are mostly stereotyped.  Lucy Lallos the tricycle-riding alcoholic was the best, and Champ the dog was good.  The hero Detective Jack Mills is handsome, athletic and incorruptible. His marriage is on the rocks because of his dedication to his job. There's a black officer with a chip on his shoulder about being black, and an attractive female officer with a chip on her shoulder about being attractive and female, a hooker with a heart of gold, a rich obnoxious lawyer and sinister Mafiosi.  It is all well done and the writer knows his craft and how to divert us with red herrings and how to keep us on the edge of our seats with cliffhanger chapter endings and clever switches of POV but we've been here before. The climactic hostage scene was high in tension but low in plausibility. <br /> The most original touch is the dense Long Island atmosphere.  If you live there this might be appealing, but there was nothing that made me want to jump onto the LIRR and take a look at the place. <br />	2005-06-08

I realize it started off based on a news story about a suicide but that's no reason to tack one onto a work of fiction. Writers are paid to invent.<br />There's a long-winded buildup which contributes nothing to the main story except that it's maybe meant ot show us what a dimwit Charles Bovary is.  Well, message received and understood in the first few pages - no need to give all the story of the first marriage.<br />One oddity is the first person narrator who appears on page one and knew C B in high school then disappears, leaving us with MPOV until he's bumped off most of his POV's and omniscient narrator steps in, at least I think he does. There's this strange sudden change to present tense when he describes what is happening to Berthe.  So the way I'd rewrite is to have this narrator as more of a character. Possibly he could step in with the few thousand that Emma needs to pay off the American Express bill and Charles need never know anything.  Or maybe couldn't we thicken the plot by letting Charles have a bit on the side with Madame Homais.<br />Actually you could leave Emma's suicide in there.  The unnecessary depressing bit is Charles's breakdown and his rejection of his mother's help.  Why not have had her move back in and re-organize his finances.  M. Homais might well have tincture of St John's wort in his pharmacy and that could help lift Charles's mood.<br />Justine and Berthe are promising characters. It would be great if they could get together and Justine could make it to medical school.  He's closer to Berthe in age than to Emma I think.  Their little budding romance would lighten things up considerably.<br />There's some great food writing. Some recipes would be useful.  I'm not pretending I read it all in French but I did check out some of the stuff at the wedding breakfast.  Andouilles a l'oseille is a traditional Normandy dish that involves slowly smoking the pigs gut. Maybe white Yankees wouldn't go for sausages made of chitterlings. I don't know where the sorrel (oseille) comes in - that would impart a lemon flavor.  While we're there I notice that  Lowell Blair (who I assume to be American) translates \\"cr&egrave;me jaune\\" as \\"custard\\" but my Penguin English French dictionary translates custard as \\"cr&egrave;me anglaise\\" which is made yellow by egg yolks (or Bird's custard powder in Britain).  Normandy \\"cr&egrave;me fraiche\\" (and English clotted cream and double cream) can look yellow, but if Flaubert meant cr&egrave;me fraiche wouldn't he have written that (unless cr&egrave;me fraiche was only invented after pasteurization had been invented). It must have been thick enough to write letters on in nonpareille, floating on the surface. (Easy enough to pick holes in a translation but aren't nonpareils the same thing in English? They're what New Yorkers call sprinkles - why bring in sugared almonds?).  The cherries and cream that Leon and Emma eat at the island restaurant sound difficult to deal with if these were fresh unpitted cherries.<br /> Cheminois remain a mystery to all translators; some kind of cake or bread loaf one supposes, but why only available for M. Homais in Rouen?  They must have been able to bake in Yonville even if they didn't, as Mme Homais complained, have stuffed pigs' feet.

I don't know where the sorrel (oseille) comes in - that would impart a lemon flavor.  While we're there I notice that  Lowell Blair (who I assume to be American) translates \\"crme jaune\\" as \\"custard\\" but my Penguin English French dictionary translates custard as \\"crme anglaise\\" which is made yellow by egg yolks (or Bird's custard powder in Britain).  Normandy \\"crme fraiche\\" (and English clotted cream and double cream) can look yellow, but if Flaubert meant crme fraiche wouldn't he have written that (unless crme fraiche was only invented after pasteurization had been invented). It must have been thick enough to write letters on in nonpareille, floating on the surface. (Easy enough to pick holes in a translation but aren't nonpareils the same thing in English? They're what New Yorkers call sprinkles - why bring in sugared almonds?).  The cherries and cream that Leon and Emma eat at the island restaurant sound difficult to deal with if these were fresh unpitted cherries.   Cheminois remain a mystery to all translators; some kind of cake or bread loaf one supposes, but why only available for M. Homais in Rouen?

The authors believe \\"It ain't what folks don't know is the problem so much as what they think they know that ain't so.\\" The central message could be phrased as that fatness doesn't matter as much as they try to make you think, but that would be oversimplifying it. There's nothing simple about this book.  I started it thinking I knew a lot more about obesity than when I finished it. <br />The authors write elegantly with sharp wit, but even so it is rather heavy going because of the density of information and closely reasoned argument.  Although it is an important book it it difficult to know who to recommend it too, maybe anybody in the health or education field who enjoys good writing and doesn't mind having their assumptions shaken..  It's not a self-help book for dieters.   <br />The Australian perspective is interesting. Americans are still reeling from finding they are the world's fattest men (apart from some Pacific islanders) and the British are upset from finding that they are the least athletic white nation, with curling as their only Olympic gold. The skinny athletic Australians have managed to convince themselves that they are slothful overeaters <br />	2005-05-28

That makes it one of those books where saying what it's about doesn't make it sound very appealing. He goes to Berlin to meet with a prominent ex-East German (\\"Ossie\\") potato expert but finds he is dead, tries to get access to his important research on potato flavors, and is \\"helped\\" by some questionable characters, who mostly turn out ot be very far from helpful, especially the Ossies, who are, apparently, a breed apart.  He is a kind-hearted  sensitive man with a vein of cynicism that is not enough to prevent him from being victimized in a series of misadventures that are half comic and half tragic.  The translator, Peter Tegel, does a wonderful and unobtrusive job that even makes the translated jokes quite funny.   <br /> As potato-centered books go it's more entertaining than the last one I read  (Cormac O'Grada's  \\"Black '47\\").

I started it preparing myself for a hatchet job, but found, slightly to my disappointment, much that was well-balanced and reasonable. <br />The first chapters contained unverified statements about child psychology.such as \\"overprotected kids do not flourish.\\" I'll leave the dodgeball issue to NASPE members. <br />The accounts of Maslow and Carl Rogers and the encounter therapies of the sixties flog some dead horses (Maslow died in 1970 and Carl Rogers in1987). <br />Chapter 3, from Sin to Syndrome, hits some easy targets in examples of psychiatric defenses in criminal cases, but is rather superficial. I'd agree with what they say about the management of pedophiles. I think they shortchange the possibility of abnormal brain chemistry leading to addiction, but they talk excellent sense about the brain imaging studies.  <br />Chapter four contains a useful summary of what is know about the course and therapy of bereavement.  I'd recommend it to any student who doesn't have time to read Zisook  (\\"Biopsychosocial Aspects of Bereavement\\") or Parkes.  The discussion of PTSD and its treatment is well informed and helpful. The evidence about support groups for medical illnesses is dealt with fairly. Perhaps it's an unfair shot but, after looking at the jacket photographs, one rather wonders about the authors' credentials for pontificating about combat veterans.  <br /> Chapter five deals with the emergency psychotherapeutic response to disaster in scathing and nihilistic terms that are probably well justified but become repetitious after having made the well-worn observation that the usefulness of debriefing is questionable. <br />I didn't find it highly readable.  Maybe that's because it's not polemical and biased enough. It's largely made up of summaries of other people's writings and some of the best bits are quotations from others, such as the man offered bereavement counseling after the death of his 105 year old aunt. <br />	2005-05-06

It's Britain the 40's and 50's. His characters step inadvertently from it into nightmare worlds. He skirts the boundaries of S&M pornography without ever quite crossing.  His characters remain virginal and there is no splatterpunk. <br /> In this one the buildup is slow and insidious and you have to tolerate a story-within-a-story with digressions and feeble jokes until the tension builds up to the weirdly fascinating climax. <br />   Incidentally this Ballantiyne paperback, the one pictured by amazon, only contains \\"Ringstones.\\"  He also wrote \\"The Sound of His Horn\\" and \\"The Dollmaker\\".

I'm glad to say this is the second in the series and the action follows on \\"The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.\\" The reason I'm glad to say that is that it means there are three more to come that I have to look forward to. If such were possible, it's an improvement over N1LDA because the separate stories are more closely intertwined.  Each mystery presents an ethical dilemma rather than a clue driven puzzle, and each tale has a moral. The primary mystery is about a young American whose mother is trying to find why he disappeared.  Several others crop up, and Mma Rambotswe gets engaged to Mr Matekoni, who has been talked into adopting two children. <br />       It's written in a very simple moralizing style. I must confess I had qualms about whether Africans were being represented in a condescending way as lovable but childlike, and whether I was being seduced into an idealized sentimental Pollyanna view of Botswana.  Janet Malcolm's essay in today's New York Times Book Review has set my mind at rest a little, but even if I can't enjoy these books with a clear conscience I'll still enjoy them. <br />	2005-04-24

When the children escaped to make a life for themselves in New York the feckless parents followed them to become homeless New Yorkers.The time-frame is vague. Watergate is mentioned while the author is in high school, so I deduced she was born around 1960.    Jeannette Walls maintains an admiration and affection for these people who literally starved and beat their kids. Much of the children's abuse was suffered at the hands of bullies who taunted them for being different, although they were able to defend themselves because of having been taught to use handguns from the age of four.	2005-04-06

Gerard Jones is the patron saint of rejected writers. The WEB site is a wonderful rant against the agents and publishers who have spurned his manuscripts.  It would have been a logical culmination, on coming to read his magnum opus, that it should have been unreadable trash. We could have smiled smugly, telling ourselves (at least myself) that the poor fellow is self-deluded and grandiose, but we have been kind enough to buy his book (at least I did) so we can snicker with a clear conscience. <br />Unfortunately it turns out that it's quite good, in fact, lets face it, grr, grr, it's very good.  Looking back, after having enjoyed it, what were the faults that led agents and publishers to fail to pick it out from the thousands.  <br /> In the first place I suppose it's too long.  After a brilliant first few chapters the action settles down to Ginny and Gerard get  together; Ginny and Gerard split up; Ginny gets drunk; Gerard does drugs.  We lose interest in the question \\"what will become of them?\\"  In the final chapters there is a denouement, but this is hurried. A stepdaughter gets a paragraph. Four grandchildren get two sentences. <br /> In the second place I'd have to echo one of the rejectionists who said that we are overstocked with reminiscences of sixties hippiedom. The theme is hackneyed. I compared this in my mind with two semi-autobiographies I had recently read, Flynn's \\"Another Bulls...t Night in Suck City\\" and Burroughs's \\"Dry\\"  Each one describes a tormented alcohol-soaked relationship, but each is startlingly original. The things that happened to Gerard were not all that unusual and it ends up being the autobiography of  an ordinary man, or one who would be ordinary if it wasn't for the WEB site. <br />Maybe he'll have to abandon the WEB site now that he's published a book.   <br />	2005-03-30

He is working as  a \\"funeral person and bartender\\" and drinking too much. An old girl friend returns to the town and he dreams of escape but it would mean leaving his five year old daughter. <br />It is a strong and intriguing plot premise and sets this apart from other run-of-the-mill coming of age novels.  The little girl is a wonderful character, and Eric's delight in her is touching. <br />The author has problems handling dialogue and makes mistakes that should have been beaten out of him in Creative Writing 101.  When characters meet he records their opening pleasantries and this results in interchanges such as: <br /> \\"So. How you been Mr.Dupree?\\" <br />  \\"Pretty good, Eric.\\" <br /> \\"And Mrs.Dupree?\\" <br /> \\"She's fine.\\" <br /> \\"That's good.\\" <br />A lot of banal conversation is recorded for no particular reason.  He often transcribes demotic speech phonetically, using such devices as an apostrophe instead of the final g in every gerund uttered by the proletariat, which I find irritating, but I may be grumpy.  Eric is sometimes given unlikely pedantic stilted turns of speech in feeble attempts at humor (yes I am grumpy- it's this diet). <br />There are descriptions of football games, which I assume must be intelligible to those who know the sport. From what I hear of the size of television audiences there are many who do know what is going on these fracas's but perhaps relatively few amongst buyers of literary first novels. <br />Incidentally I'd just come from reading Heather Cochran's \\"Mean Season\\" in which staying in a small West Virginia town deprives someone of an education.  I checked West Virginia in univsource.com and found seven community colleges as well a plenty of four year ones and a state university, but maybe it is educationally deprived.  Perhaps I am being too literal-minded.  Eric's dilemma is a universal one. <br />	2005-03-21

Its most militant revolutionary movement involved transvestites refusing to pay highway tolls; no witch was ever executed in Wales; the ancient Welsh laws enacted stern penalties for killing a cat.<br /><br /> All this presents problems for the Welsh crime writer, who is forced into realms of fantasy and satire. Aberystwyth is a name evoking such innocence that merely setting a vicious organized crime network there is a joke. The merriment of this may be lost upon the non-Welsh, of which the world contains unfortunately large numbers.<br /><br />There are some wonderful moments (such the forensic tea-cosy expert able to tell the source of any tea-cosy from a single thread and  find links to meso-American religious imagery) but the plot gets in the way of the jokes and the jokes get in the way of plot.  The author adds an alternative history fantasy element and incoherence sets in.<br /><br />It is all too much.  Pryce suffers from an over-abundance of  talent.

I had set this aside for reading as a professional duty but found it so compelling that I promoted it to my bedside. Paul Raeburn is a superb writer.<br />  That being said, I think it may be more useful to professionals than to parents. The mental health workers in this book do not come off well and it makes salutary reading.  Raeburn is perturbed by his doctors' inability to make a \\"correct\\" diagnosis and proceed from diagnosis to specific treatment. Psychiatric diagnoses tend to be fuzzy (although this is by no means confined to psychiatry. How many diagnoses of \\"fibromyalgia\\" and \\"virus infection\\" are ever scientifically proven?). In children the labeling is further complicated by the wish to avoid diagnoses that stigmatize.<br />  The use of psychotropic medications in child psychiatry is often empirical with a \\"lets try this and see\\" approach. Some children are definitely made worse by Ritalin and Adderal and other \\"upper\\" type drugs.  It may be that these include victims of a childhood version of manic-depressive illness, which Kraepelin originally described in adults.  The Papalos's, in their book \\"The Bipolar Child\\", have extended the definition of this disorder rather more widely than most experts would agree with. For a more balanced viewpoint I would recommend \\"Do They Grow Out of It?\\" edited by Lily Hechtman and \\"Child Psychopharmacology\\" edited by B Timothy Walsh.<br />  I was surprised that no mention was made of telephone hotlines, which are a valuable resource for the suicidal teenager (the national line is 1-800-SUICIDE)and of WEB sites for cutters (see my review of Tracy Alderman's \\"Scarred Soul.\\")	2005-03-10

She goes to Miami to look for him and gets involved with Hooker, a racing care driver who thinks Bill has stolen his boat.  <br />It's very unfair to Janet Evanovich to keep thinking of Stephanie Plum but all the time I was reading this I was thinking that she does Trenton better than Miami.  After about page 200 it turns into a sunken treasure, Cuban agent, guns-boats-helicopters, Southern Florida action story  that is good of its kind but which Hiassen, Buchanan,David Barry, and above all (in a more serious vein) John D MacDonald can do as well or better. <br />Part of the fun is Alex Barnaby's expertness as a car mechanic, but that had me turning my thoughts back to  Barbara Seranella's Munch Mancini.  Seranella does the wrench wench thing far better.  Compared with her, Evanovich fudges on technical details, and compared with Munch Mancini Alex and Stephanie are pampered children of privilege. <br />	2005-02-28

One of her targets is her own book. \\"it sounds like one of those novels. You know. Three generations of women blah, blah, blah. Triumph over adversity. After many trials it all turns out ok in the end.\\" That does basically summarise the plot. The heroine Rebecca Monroe is a cultural historian married to a nasty evolutionary psychologist and worried about the genetics of bipolar disorder in her family. (It's interesting to me that manic-depressive illness, which has become such a modish literary plot device, dates back to Emil Kraepelin, and that the genetic studies that so much concern Rebecca Monroe are based on old-fashioned study of family trees rather than any fancy molecular biology, and owe more to Gregor Mendel than Crick and Watson)   There are jabs, sometimes savage and bitter, at every fashion in British life in the forties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties and the twenty-first centuary. I think you'd  have to know a lot about the things and times she skewers to properly appreciate it.  Some of the merriment is derived from poking fun at what those benighted Britons in those distant decades thought was new and fashionable, which is not quite fair.

Krakauer likes to take unexplainable human actions and try to explain them, usually ending up saying they cannot be explained. He is such an excellent writer that his books read through as gripping adventure stories and the philosophy and psychology never hold the action up. <br />       He cleverly puts a detailed account of the terrible Lafferty murders right at the beginning of the book, causing us to ask \\"why? why?\\"  Then he backtracks 150 years and then digresses all over North America but keeps us reading hoping to get the answer. <br />       I can understand the indignation of Mormon readers, because he looks for the reason for the murders in the Mormon religion, although he also targets religion in general. <br />       My paperback copy, printed in June 2004 contains a refutation at the back by Richard E Tarley Jr, an LDS historian, with a response by Krakauer.  I'd certainly say, even after reading Krakauer, that the places where I worry about walking alone after dark are not Mormon neighborhoods. <br />        As regards mental illness, paranoid delusions and religious beliefs, he does a certain amount of re-inventing the wheel.  These arguments about when the other guy's \\"weird\\" or \\"bizarre\\" religious beliefs are evidence of insanity have been gone over often in other places.  One of the few pieces of research he left out is what medications Ron Lafferty was given in his 16 months in  Utah State Hospital.  Krakauer refers to antipsychotic medications.

Maria Flook is not a mere journalist. She is a fine writer able to adorn her story with many literary flourishes. This book contains a lot of interesting descriptions of the Paris and New York fashion journalism scenes and about Vassar and the university of East Anglia and the sociology and history of Cape Cod.     She goes into great detail about several of  Christa's former lovers and implies that one of them may have been the man who had sex with her just before she was killed. The fact is that all of them were excluded by DNA testing. (The possibility remains that that man was not the murderer).         She skimps on following the money trail. For example she says that the Grammercy Square apartment was sold for \\"an undisclosed amount.\\" A mere journalist would have found out how much. (The house given to Christa by her father was recently sold for a million dollars).   Every writer of true crime lives in the shadow of Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood.\\"  Maria Flook is a talented writer. I recommend that you read her book. I recommend that you do not read \\"In Cold Blood.' It is not a nice experience. In order to avoid reading it, do not ever let yourself look at one page.

An intriguing feature of the addictive quality of these stories is that Hanks finds the place depressing and the people unattractive, and keeps coming across grisly crimes and yet they are diverting light entertainment.  <br />       This one contrives to introduce every clich about the South by having effete Charleston aristocrats come to Maggody to take part in a re-enactment of a Civil War skirmish. There's a lot of interesting information about the cult of Civil War re-enactment.

She never meets a Turk she doesn't like. <br />       It livens up when she describes some misadventures at the beginning and at the end (and her Turkish bath experience in Istabul) but on the whole it doesn't work as a travel book to be read from beginning to end for entertainment. <br />       Readers will have their own opinions about her accounts of twentieth century Turkish history.  That's a touchy subject I wouldn't touch with a barge pole. When it comes to ancient history,  she finds Urartians lovable and Hittites hateful and Mother Goddess worship everywhere ( and loves the word \\"chthonic\\"). <br />	2005-01-10

The editor, Clifford Chase was looking for memories of \\"that key transitional moment.\\" There are certainly many questions that arise from studying the early adolescence of homosexual people.         How does it arise that gay males have constellations of interests in particular fields? Why the liberal arts rather than the physical sciences? Why acting rather than football? Is this really true or is it a prejudiced stereotype? How and why do effeminate or butch mannerisms arise?        Does the gay student need to be protected from peer persecution? Are segregated   high schools justified.?    A taboo question is that of \\"nature or nurture?\\"  Many gays get annoyed if we even consider the possibility of homosexuality being other than inborn, although some  transsexuals are liable to insist that sex roles are social constructs and that a chromatin negative person can choose to be a female.   The collection does not answer all these questions or identify a key moment.  What is does have, and which may be a homosexual trait, is superb literary merit. Every story is a gem.              Most of the memories are surprisingly benign and many of the childhoods are remembered as pleasant.  Recollections of being \\"scowled and smirked at\\" in gym class, such as that of Ralph Sassons, are counterbalanced by the titillating voyeuristic pleasures of such settings.  The only horrendous abuse, in Justin Chins \\"The Beginning of my Worthlessness\\" was not inflicted as a penalty for effeminacy although it fed into a later feeing of homosexuality as a stigma.     (By the way the book \\"Peace from Nervous Suffering\\" that Sassons' mother found helpful is by Claire Weekes, an Australian pschiatrist, and I have often recommended it.)	2005-01-06

Amy is seduced by her math teacher.  Amy and Isabelle fight and become reconciled. Isabelle gradually becomes less isolated. The mysteries of her past are revealed.   It's a strong plot without being a melodramatic or high-concept one. <br />    I found it hard to believe this was a first novel because it is so superbly crafted. It is told mainly from the point of view of Isabelle and Amy but shifts POV seamlessly whenever needed so as to give a vivid picture of the town of Shirley Falls.  Sometimes an omniscient narrator steps in unobtrusively.  The story opens during a hot humid summer. The main action is takes place over the preceding year, with each season artfully drawn; then it climaxes during a brisk autumn. It is further anchored in time by an evocative period setting in the early 60's, with men landing on the moon, typewriters, home economics classes, illegal abortions, and rumors of sexual liberation.  When earlier back story is needed it is brought into perfectly natural dialog.   <br />       The characters are simple unsophisticated people but Strout neatly brings in literary parallels. Isabelle is mortified when Amy corrects her mispronunciation of Yeats.  She tries to read the classics and is captivated by Madame Bovary.  She thinks Emma should have stood by her man and tried to make something out of poor Charles. <br />         Actually Charles Bovary is about the only male character who gets a good grade in this book.  Most of the men are lecherous losers. Sisterhood is powerful in the end.   <br />	2004-12-18

He recommends a British site, the website of the National Self-harm Network [...] <br />        SIV victims often get more help from talking to each other than from therapists or pills.

You have to tolerate cliches,corny sentimentality, and holding up of action for the first person narrator to reminisce and philosophise. The humor is home-spun.In earlier ones in the series there were some terribly poorly constructed plots and clunky writing but Taylor seems to have learned on the job and this is a tightly plotted mystery that builds up suspense and keeps the pages turning.   <br />    Incidentally, Lutheran Sunday schools can't have being doing a very good job if Toby Bauer thinks Moses preached the Sermon on the Mount.	2004-12-08

To be frank, most of the rest is hard going unless you're adept at reading early nineteenth century English, perhaps an English or history major. De Quincey was a rambling and digressive writer, even by nineteenth century standards. There is some fascination in the interlocking lives of this circle of writers of the romantic movement (the \\"Lake Poets\\";Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey, and their contemporaries Keats, Shelley and Byron) especially if you've read Richard Holmes's wonderful biographies.<br /><br /> You can get the \\"Confessions of an English Opium Eater\\" alone cheaper in the Dover edition. This Penguin Classics edition contained other writings which are of limited appeal, but the notes and the introduction and appendix by Barry Mulligan make it more understandable and provide useful historical background about opium use.<br /><br /> Opium was freely available over the counter in England  until 1858, so this could be read as a warning about what might happen with legalization.  It has always been a puzzle that De Quincey  and Coleridge described vivid dreams and  hallucinations as part of their experience, whereas opioids used  by addicts today are not usually hallucinogenic. De Quincey was aware that his experiences were atypical and offered his own explanations  (\\"one whose talk is of oxen will dream of oxen\\").<br /><br />  I was intrigued his account of the relief of his withdrawal symptoms by the use of valerian (prescribed by Bell of Bell's palsy).	2004-12-01

The editor's purpose, according to Shacochis's introduction, is to show that we have now become humorless puritans and that D S and S are victimless indulgences. There was once a happier time when we were less inhibited about these things  and life was the better for it.         This purpose fails. Victims abound. The male authors (all heterosexual) come across as boasting about sexual conquests.  Erica Jong cheerfully describes a rape and Nabokov describes you-know-what.  St. Paul would have found a lot of justification here.         The drinkers all seem to be problem drinkers and I can't say the smokers make their habit sound positively enjoyable.          However there is some wonderful writing from a starry assembly of the century's finest American writers (if we included Nabokov and Anais Nin as American). Some of the humor dates a little.  For example Art Buchwald's  satire on wine talk has been repeated many times (although I don't think anyone has improved on Thurber's \\"It's a nave little burgundy but I think you'll be amused at its pretensions.\\")         It's well worth reading. I don't think it will lead anyone astray.	2004-11-19

It's farcical light entertainment, which is something more difficult to do well than is the dead serious literary novel.  Part of the difficulty is making characters realistic rather than stick figures. Burroughs accomplishes this.  We end up feeling for the misfortunes of Max the TV personality unjustly fired for indecent exposure.  The rigidly conventional churchgoing closet alcoholic Peggy Jean starts out as a stereotyped figure of fun but develops complexities.   <br />I suppose I'm like most readers in having bought this after \\"Running with Scissors\\" and \\"Dry.\\"  It's not quite as good those masterpieces but contain interesting elements that foreshadow them.  The scenes in the rehab hospital have elements similar to those in \\"Dry.\\" <br />From the point of view of Augustenian scholarship I found the Anne Sexton references interesting.  Sexton has been the subject of two muckraking biographies, one by Diane Wood Middlebrook and the other (The House on Mercy Street) by her daughter.

Alice's father is killed when she is is five (or seven, I wasn't sure). Her mother has obnoxious lovers and  suffers a vaguely described mental illness which results, for some reason, in her spending years in a mental hospital. Alice is brought up largely by her aunt and uncle and spends time living with her decrepit grandmother.        Alice seems lonely (no school friends are ever described) and forms bonds with the family chauffeur and and her English teacher, who both die. (I was reminded a little of Lemony Snicker's disaster-prone Beaudelaire children). Later she connects up again with her mother. Alice's boy friend resembles one of her mother's, and parallels are drawn between the behaviors of the three generations. She never talks to any of her mother's doctors or discusses her diagnosis and treatment.                As an account of growing up with a mentally ill mother it suffered in my estimation because I had recently read Virginia Holman's superb \\"Rescuing Patty Hearst.\\"  There is some fine poetic writing, perhaps overly poetic. The opulent surroundings in the Midwest and Arizona are well described but I felt that the wealth of the characters detracted from realism. Everyone is filthy rich. They make their money the old-fashioned way; they inherit it. They drift in a never-never land, where money problems may involve the dreadful prospect of selling great grandmama's pearls.           It's only 156 pages, eked out with blank pages and single sentence chapters. It seems that this is a graceful and elegant literary short story writer who has yet to make the transition to the major leagues.	2004-11-08

They have sexual affairs of various persuasions. Karoly or Charles Gabor is from Cleveland and is the son of 1956 emigres. He is trying to profit by the opening up of Hungary to private enterprise and plans to acquire the publishing house of Imre Horvath, a heroic survivor of the German and Russian occupations. <br />       The Gabor-Horvath plot doesn't start up until page 126, at which point the rest of the story is set aside and we are given forty pages of the history of the Horvath  publishing house.  Every now and then we come back to this plot, but mostly Phillips is interested in rich descriptions of Budapest topography and the psychological lives of his characters and the sociology of post-communist Eastern Europe.  His style is rich and allusive, with much erudition about such subjects as jazz and pop music. For example \\"Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto's duet\\" meaning the Girl from Ipomema.   <br />        The descriptions are often digressive. One scene is set in a night club in the basement of an old house. We are given the names of the jazz musicians in a mural on the wall and a three generation history of the occupants of the house. <br />        A melodramatic ending is rather tacked on. Two important characters. Mark and Scott, disappear long before the end.  <br />       There is some quite wonderful bravura writing such as \\"the white March rain made acidic hissing noises as it drilled little siver-gray holes halfway into the depths of the crusty, brown-spotted banks of old snow \\"  and some great dialog and humor, such as the final confrontation between John's two American loves, the shaven-headed artist Nicky and the pony-tailed embassy  attach Emily.   <br />        With so much good writing there may have been a problem of what to cut out but this could have been cut to half the size, and left with an inconclusive ending if the author could not think of a artistically logical one. <br />	2004-11-07

He has explored, and continues to explore in this collection, the problems of the gay teenager trying to find a place in society. <br />       Two of these stories are about gay men worried about being accused of pedophilia. (In fact statistics show that the least likely man to sexually molest a child is an adult gay in a stable relationship with another male).  <br />In \\"The Girl Next Door\\" a man stops helping a neglected and abused child  because of fear of this accusation.  In other hands it would have been a grim tearjerker. Some tears are jerked here but they come through laughter as the episode is recounted with utter believability and absence of sentimentality. <br />In other stories he tries to help a mentally ill sister, and gets thrown out of his family home because of being homosexual - again told realistically, told for laughs, and told without self-pity. <br />     <br />	2004-10-26

Maybe I'm snobbish but that put me off and relegated it to the romance category. I was expecting an unlikely story full of clichs and slushy sentimentality.  Its central plot is not really about the movie star but a realistic and finely crafted  tale of a woman forced to stay home to look after a brain-injured  brother and a depressed mother.  It is told in a spare pitch-perfect prose with never a wasted word.. I was reminded of Bobby Anne Mason, and even Eudora Welty.  <br />    \\"Back in Momma's worst times I'd call Tommy or Susan for help but neither ever offered to head home for even a week to make dinner or check which bills were least overdue. (That was around the same time the idea of me going off to a full-time college stopped being talked about like it was a good thing, something that might really happen.)\\" <br />      Even the movie actor angle is not entirely fantastic (especially with Martha Stewart in minimum security in West Virginia). Joshua is a soap opera actor making a movie om location in the area, convicted of a second DUI, and sentenced to house arrest with work and AA release. <br />       I've got to admit that it is warm and fuzzy and ends happily, so that it won't get reviewed in the Times Literary Supplement or the New York Review of Books but it contains better writing than many more pretentious works. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-24

Others have criticized him for choosing to write in the first person about the sex life of a much younger female, so I won't join that chorus. If we made a rule that writers had to be the same age and sex as their protagonists then literature would be much impoverished. My problem is that I lose interest when characters drift off into dreamland and  I'm not sure whether they're remembering things or imagining them.  Rayfield did a lot of that in Split Levels.  In Colony Girl he kept things anchored in his fictional real world but he's back at it again here.  <br />     Eve, from Colony Girl has arrived in Manhattan, at the age of 16 and obtained her own apartment. How she did that would have been an interesting story, since she's nave and friendless and poor. Her only social contacts are in the bar where she's working  off the books, for Victor, the illegal Mingrelian, who wants to marry her. She witnesses a rape and knife attack and goes to tell the police about it, but then isn't sure if she was imagining it or is telling lies about it. Some implausible melodramatic  developments arise  from this two hundred pages later but there's puzzlement rather than suspense build-up.  Characters tend to be enigmatic and act in strange ways anyway. <br />     Victor is the most interesting character and the most likely New Yorker, with realistic   <br />money and housing dilemmas.  I hope he's the center of the next Rayfiel.  <br />      Why should we bother to read the next Rayfiel? Just read the first four sentences of this one and you'll know why. <br />	2004-10-19

They could be suckered into reading this by the way it starts out as an interesting coming of age romance - \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" (to which deliberate reference in made) set in suburban New Jersey in the 1980's with a few innocuous ethnic jibes (\\"I felt at home there. Jews are like Italians only smarter\\") and social satiric jabs (\\"You can tell that sophisticated people live here because all their photographs are black and white.\\"). Then they may need advanced cardiac life support soon after page 99 (where the sex is more or less hetero). A wise precaution might be to test them out with small doses of Augusten Burroughs and Sedaris. <br />    A second warning is for insomniacs like me who read themselves to sleep rather than take Ambien. I finished it at three this morning. Luckily it's Sunday. <br />    The third caveat is about reading it in any place where you might look odd laughing aloud. There's a high laugh aloud risk factor. Maybe the PATH from Christopher Street to Hoboken would be safe because everybody else will be reading it. <br />     <br />	2004-10-17

It is not what it seems, and yet it is what it seems. <br />The traditional British cosy whodunnit resembled the commedia dell'arte in its conventions. Certain stock characters recurred. Only a limited number of occupations was allowed. Those who were not detectives were Anglican clergymen, doctors, lawyers, retired military men, domestic servants or independently wealthy. Women did not have jobs and those unmarried past a certain age were likely to be eccentric, albeit endearingly eccentric.  The acquisition of large amounts of money, other than through inheritance, was rather suspect, and nouveau riche was a term of abuse.  A chorus of the lower classes lurked in the background.  Their speech  (which  was rendered phonetically, on the assumption that upper-class British English was standard) often contained amusing malapropisms.  Some characters were experts in unusual subjects, such as Egyptology or insects (but nothing high-tech).   <br />       Above all was the setting. This was a village, isolated, and yet at the same time situated in southern England with access to London. It was old and picturesque. People lived in cottages or manors or vicarages (unless they were nouveau riche) and were passionate about gardening. Emma might have lived there. <br />        The writing  often contained clichs, stilted dialog, and telling-instead-of-showing, but this did not matter because the plot was carried along by engaging the reader to solve, by means of carefully placed clues, the mystery of who killed the character done to death in a bizarre way in the first chapter. (Violence was off-stage). Red herrings abounded. Just when a supect seemed the likely murderer he would be bumped off. <br />       Writing this kind of novel today is rather like hand weaving. It is still done and the practitioner uses many of the old methods, but often wants to add a modern twist. A certain amount of self-parody is involved, and the modern reader is made aware that the writer has her tongue partly in her cheek.    <br />         Caroline Graham does all this beautifully. She even throws in pieces of bad writing (such as describing a minor character as \\"extremely wealthy\\") which I think are deliberate tributes to the stylized old form. The 21st century is allowed to intrude in the form of cell phones (mobiles) and supermarkets,and obscene language but we are shown that it it rather vulgar. The people who live in the projects (council houses) eat processed foods and fish and chips, while the people like us dine on fresh sea bass bought at the fishmongers and cooked with fennel. <br />          Dennis Brinkley is a financial planner (not a solicitor, as Marilyn Stasio and the blurb say - a solicitor  is a lawyer who does not do courtroom work) who collects medieval war machines, one of which kills him. (This doesn't happen until page 120). We are drawn, in the classic Agatha Christie mode, to suspect each one of a cast of characters in turn. Benny is Brinkley's elderly, angelic but slightly dotty, platonic girl friend, Andrew Latham is his incompetent unhappily married partner.  Polly is the spoiled unscrupulous daughter of his neighbors, the Lawsons,who have inherited the house and money of  their eccentric elderly aunt.  Ava is a fraudulent (but is she really) spiritualist medium.  Karen is her abused daughter.  The closet transvestite George Footscray is her impresario.  <br />  <br />         <br />	2004-10-15

(But then again would we think differently about it if he'd used a female pseudonym and a fake photo?)       Another strike against it was that I'd found Rayfiel's last book \\"Split Levels\\" poorly constructed. A lot of pretentious stream of consciousness and dream sequences interrupted a moderately good mystery in an irritatingly anonymous suburb.          This is a great improvement, although it still attempts too much and I must agree with other critics that the sex scenes are implausible and intrusive.  Aside from her unlikely eroticism Eve is a great character. She is a fatherless girl whose mother has fled from California to Iowa. She takes up with a motherless boy whose father wants to flee from Iowa to California. She lives in a religious commune run by a \\"charismatic\\" leader reminiscent in a remarkable number of ways, which may be coincidental (I'm phrasing this tactfully) of the fraudulent guru in Updike's \\"S.\\"         Rayfiel cleverly exposes the ways religious cults can almost legitimize child molestation by early arranged marriages and political clout.  One of the techniques is to persuade the girl that marriage is a short cut from childhood to adult status. I was reminded of Pearl Abraham's \\"The Romance Reader.\\"        Above all he is a gifted writer. By the end of the book we have a map of Arhat, Iowa, in our heads, and yet he never pauses for long-winded description. He has a seamless ability to make a few words do the work of setting the scene without adjectives and without holding up the action.  For example, in one scene Eve feels ill because of working on the highway in the hot sun and gets into the shade of \\"a sign that listed Arhat's two motels. It was late afternoon. The metal threw a patch of shadow almost to the drainage ditch.\\"	2004-10-02

Nick's life sometimes seems to be taking a similar course and he watches the old man's decay with a mixture of compassion and repulsion.  Nick takes a job dealing with the homeless and his father becomes one of his clients.  His brother refuses any contact with the father. His mother kills herself.         The writing is wonderful. The style is minimalist. In spite of the tragic events that are described  a sharp sense of humor gleams through.         It's thought-provoking in many ways and on many levels. I was especially intrigued by the way it casts a look that is sometimes cynical and despairing at our well-meaning efforts to help the homeless. I'd recently read Christopher Jenck's \\"The Homeless\\" and Isaac and Armat's  \\"Madness in the Streets\\" but this gave me insights of a different kind.   Incidentally, why on earth couldn't the New York Times bring itself to print the whole title?

He makes clever use of lines from Irish songs and romantic legends. He piles atrocity story on atrocity story. In the end it's more  political statement than entertainment but it's wonderful writing.  <br />     I understand that Kiely usually writes in a lighter vein, and shall be looking for more of his stuff. <br />	2004-09-17

He combines his interests by dressing up in a horned head-dress, sheepskin vest and sheepskin leggings (the covering of intervening body areas is unspecified)and climbing Mt. Wrangell while hallucinating. It's often difficult to tell from the writing whether he is hallucinating or whether the action is supposed to be realistic. (I'm afraid I always yawn over books with this confusion unless they're written by James Joyce. Describe a dream - lose me as a reader.)He gets mauled by wolves, who may be imaginary. At times I was on their side.     <br />       I'm afraid there's always a certain risibility factor about sheep (even though these are Dall mountain sheep) and thoughts came to mind of a certain episode in Woody Allen's movie version of \\"Everything You Wanted to Know about S..\\" and of the title of a recent book by Niall Griffiths. Shapero treats his theme with great solemnity. His protagonist develops his own sheep/volano religion and nobody ever cracks a smile. <br />        There is some great nature writing containing some obscure (perhaps pretentious)vocabulary words e.g. \\"diving by scalloped arcades past merlons rising from crimson slides.\\" I imagine readers of Krakauer and Barry Lopez may be impressed, as I was by his descriptions of Alaskan plants and wildlife and the climactic scenes of fire mixing with ice at the snowy summit of Mt. Wrangell. <br />        It's probably an irrelevant quibble but if Mt Wrangell is 12000 feet high can a helicopter fly over the caldera? Don't these things have a ceiling height they can fly at? <br />  <br />	2004-09-13

A missing-child thriller with George V Higgins style wisecracking Boston cops and robbers and double double crosses.. <br />       It's the fourth in the Angela Gennaro/Patrick Kenzie series, with Kenzie as first person narrator. The action seems to follow on Darkness Take My Hand. I'd recommend starting with A Drink Before the War to get the background.  They are recruited into the search by the child's aunt and uncle, while her airheaded junkie single mom seems to enjoy being the center of attention. <br />       The dialog isn't quite up to George V Higgins but Lehane is a greater scene-setter  with a gift for creating an atmosphere in half a sentence like \\"....light sleet fell and spattered windshields and stuck in our hair like lice.\\" <br />        There's a lot of blood and guts and horrific child abuse and murder. Not one happy camper in the book so it's a tad depressing in spite of the flashes of mordant humor.  <br />        The plot is complicated and demands attention (you might be able to figure out whodunnit by page 200) so it's best read in one or two sittings, which is difficult at over 400 pages. It's a page-turner but not good bedtime or beach reading. I'd recommend it for a long flight in coach class, or maybe if you're visiting Boston. <br />	2004-09-05

The multiple authors set out to show, using the best scientific methods, what really works in treating mental illness.  It's a concept that has worked well in areas such as cardiology and surgery for deciding the best ways to treat things like hypertension and breast cancer (although less well for deciding the best ways to treat things like backache or dizziness).  They are masters of statistics and methodology.             When it comes to medication use and clearly defined entities they do well. They confirm for us that lithium is good for classical bipolar disorder, that ECT helps some kinds ofsevere depression, and that people with schizophrenia do better if they take anti-psychotic medications.  If anyone needed a book to convince them of these things then this is it.           What they don't do, which I had hoped (rather than expected) they might do, is deal with the various competing forms of non-medication treatment and tell us in exactly what ways they are different and whether one works better than the other. For example five studies of \\"care pathways\\" in treatment of \\"depressive disorders\\" are carefully reviewed. They include \\"relapse prevention program\\" and \\"multifacetted quality improvement programme\\" I did not end up with any clear idea of what these were, whether they were different or whether one was superior to the other.            In regard to the \\"brand name\\" psychotherapies they just accept whatever name an author chooses to give to his or her brand. Then, when reviewing treatment trials, they  compare groups given different brands of therapy. Our biggest doubts are whether these aren't all really all just ways of talking, with the differences depending on the therapists' personalities rather than their name brand.          It is directed at a sophisticated professional audience and does not score high marksfor readability.There is a worthy  attampt to incorporate a brief course in medical statistics into an appendix and front matter but I don't think that will make it understandable to the general reader.	2004-09-03

He's in North Carolina for an operation, presumably at Duke, which seems rather a gamble given that every Carolinian he meets is a dim-witted country rube, except for an emotionally disturbed teenage entomologist suspected of multiple murder and kidnapping. He gets recruited by the local police who need the help of one of them clever New Yorkers. I don't think this book is going to do much for good relations between New york and North Carolina (I haven't read all the other reviews yet so I don't know if any Southern hackles were raised) <br />    It's a police procedural techno-thriller using the usual devices to keep you on the edge of your seat. There are four young female characters to get in peril and rescued in the nick of time. (This is I believe known in the trade as the attractive-young-female-in-peril-who mistakes-the good-guys-for-the-bad-guys gimmick. It was started in the eighteenth century with \\"The Castle of Otranto\\" and Jabe Austen thought she'd killed it with \\"Northanger Abbey\\" in 1817) To be fair, Jeffrey Deaver is very good at this suspense business and at making us m-t-g-g-f-t-b-guys. In order to build up suspense he chops the narratice up between multiple points of view so as to end chapters on cliffhangers. Sometimes an omniscient narrator steps in to explain things about geography,history, insects, geology, plants, gas chromatography and quadriplegia. When he's not there the characters explain these things to each other  <br />     There are a confusing number of characters to begin with but is gets simpler as seven of them are shot to death. Two characters get stung to death by wasps. One character makes a joke (it's about quadriplegia). <br />    I noticed a lot of plausibility problems and by the end I was doing a lot of \\"no-that-would-never-happen\\" but by then I was hooked. Actually the thing that seduced me into starting this book wasn't any of the gimmicks but the quiet poetic descriptions of coastal swamp scenery and realistic Bobby Ann Mason type atmosphere build-up on the first three pages. <br />	2004-08-29

Alix, the 29 year old divorced American first-person narrator, is in London for two months to write a romance novel. If she fails she has to return to Seattle to live with her family. That part of the plot was relatively good. She is writing an atrocious pornographic bodice-ripper. There is some nice comedy as she tries reading extracts to all sorts of people she meets in London and they give their critiques. <br />   The main plot is less satisfactory. It's the old story of an aloof man (Mr Darcy rides again) who is loved by a heroine too stubborn to overlook his rebuffs. It's very conventional uninspired romance stuff. I suppose the difference between chick-lit and romance is essentially that the heroines of romance take themselves more seriously and the action is less realistic. In chick-lit the setting is usually contemporary London or New York, with stops for jet-setting. <br />     The amount of explicit sex alllowed varies in both genres. In this book there's quite a lot, in fact I thought it rather held up the more interesting action but maybe I just don't have a dirty enough mind.	2004-08-21

Every incident is carefully described in term of sight sound and smell (it's fascinating to note how much she uses smells.) Some readers think this holds upthe action but it produces a vivid realism. Comparing her with, say, Elmore Leonard, is like comparing an old Dutch master with a French impressionist - both geniuses in separate ways. <br />   Another distinctive feature of the series is the gradual unfolding of the story of Kinsey's life. She was orphaned in infancy, lost contact with her family, and has been married twice. To get the full flavor of that I would advise starting further back in the series.  <br />    A is for Alibi was published in 1982. Kinsey was born in 1950 and the action takes place in 1987 (no laptops or cell phones). <br />    Reba is a promising new character. She exerts an almost fatal attraction over Kinsey who sees her as having many of her own traits. I think we'll see her again. <br />    My prediction for Z is for Zeitgeist? Kinsey inherits the Lompoc family estate, hooks up with Dietz, gets pregnant, and Henry bakes a wedding cake. Any other guesses?	2004-08-03

After so much bad news out of Africa, and recently reading Theroux's &quot;Dark Star Safari&quot; I was also doubtful of finding anything cheerful. My pessimism was unfounded. This is a delight. Precious Ramostwe uses the money from the sale of the cattle her father left her to start a detective agency in Botswana. She solves a series of crimes but these are secondary to the atmosphere and characterization. I don't know how authentic the picture of life in Botswana is but what is depicted rings completely true. The prose is deceptively simple and unobtrusive. Every sentence is prefectly crafted with never a wasted word.	2004-07-22

The SPOV narrator, Benson, is a WWII veteran who is in Liverpool to work on a book about that city's connection with the slave trade. He suffers writer's block and is making ends meet by giving lesson in creative writing, but a plot summary doesn't cover all of what goes on. There's a lot about how rundown Liverpool became in the 1980's under Thatcher, a lot about the slave trade, and a lot about writing. Interspersed uneasily are flashbacks of action at Anzio in WWII. Each separate theme is good but I had the impression of a writer with a notebook full of essays and stories on different subjects cobbling them togather to make a novel.      There are some wonderful characters, but an important one, Slater, the villain, a cowardly officer who became a prosperous businessman is unconvincing. Benson plots revenge on Slater for multiple vaguely specified misdeeds and this leads to an unlikely climactic scene of violence tacked on at the end. I understand this is not the best Unsworth, so I'll be trying some more of him.	2004-07-18

I was reminded at times of Brendan Behan\\"s \\"Lord help the Irish, if it was raining soup they'd be out with forks.\\"<BR>    We are first introduced to a whisky-drinking lawyer who sends his children to single sex catholic schools, keeps getting his wife pregnant, and does not believe in co-parenting. He demonstrates his lack of co-parenting skills by dumping two dead babies in the garbage on the third page. (Sorry if that sounds in bad taste but the babies in the garbage are just a page after the comment about co-parenting and I thought at first reading that the bathos was intended, but there's no intentional humor in the rest of the book.)He's the patriarch and cheers things up a little by dying early on, griefstricken over the death of another child, so there's a high body count for the fertile family females to replace (sorry again).<BR>     Amongst other ethnic traits these lace-curtain Irish find it hard to express their feelings and the matriarch \\"has no idea how to carry on a normal conversation\\" which I found easy to believe. It's a characteristic she shares with the rest of the book's characters who are liable to intersperse long speeches in complete sentences with such phrases as \\"mark my words.\\"  A lot of them have second sight or complex visual hallucinations. They start hallucinating at the drop of a hat and it can be hard to tell hallucinations from flashbacks. An added complication is that different family members take up in turn as first person narrators.<BR>     The plot largely centers on the family's reactions to the unwed pregnancy of a promiscuous grand-daughter.  Her parents each have mild extra-marital affairs but return to the fold.  Another grand-daughter gets depressed (and drunk of course) and drops out of medical school.<BR>      There's curious lack of description of physical setting (Napolitano should read some Sue Grafton) although specific places in Bergen County (Mary Higgins Clark country)are named. One character is editor of the Bergen Record and another is mayor of Ramsey. Money is mentioned but we are never told how much anything costs or how much anyone earns.(She should read some Balzac).<BR>        This all sounds very negative but I suppose those who enjoy long family sagas will enjoy it.  I probably wasn't the right reader.  I just came to this from reading Fowler's \\"Jane Austen Book Club\\" where every line of dialogue sparkles and this pales by comparison.	2004-07-02

That's about it for plot (well one of the exes returns and guess what happens).<BR>   Anything with such a slight plot depends on good characterization, sparkling dialog and great writing but I wouldn't put Alexannder in the great category. There are nice contrasting descriptions of New York and San Francisco scenes (visual and social)and of her group of friends. Sex and Christmas ornaments and food are lovingly described. (She drinks horrible mixtures of booze).<BR>    There's a faint suggestion that her problems are due to her unsatisfactory and uncommunicating,workaholic father. He is poorly drawn. He's a cardiac surgeon but we're never given any detail. A recurrent (too recurrent) gag is that his beeper keeps going off but nobody says whether a child's life needs to be saved or a heart transplanted. When he has lunch with his literary daughter he studies up on some books (current bestsellers, the ignorant slob) but she doesn't bother learning about his job. He dies off stage of cancer, but we are not told of what kind, or how he reacted to it. <BR>      Anyway, let me not be Scrooge, and Carly Alexander had fabulous reviews on her Christmas list.

These seem consistent enough and to contain enough valid observations about tides and sun movements to indicate that there was some truth in his story. The material is so sparse that in order to fill his book Cunliffe fleshes it out with a lot of speculation and archeological data. He is evidently an authority in many fields. For example he is able to detect that Polybius's attack on Pytheas &quot;has all the hallmarks of intense academic jealousy.&quot; (Cunfiffe is a professor of European archeology at Oxford). An interesting speculation is whether Pytheas reached Iceland. Cunliffe thinks he did, and presents interesting evidence. It does appear likely that Iceland was inhabited before the Vikings got there.	2004-06-13

Part II \\"Inside the brain and mind\\" would be heavy going for anyone without a medical or scientific background although the writing is admirably lucid. <BR>    I did not find any arrors of fact but readers should be aware that the Papolos's extend the diagnosis of bipolar disorder beyond what is generally accepted. They may be right but at present there is no objective test like a blood test or an X-ray to prove the diagnosis. It is often suspected when a child is made worse by drugs in the Ritalin class, which is a tough way to make a diagnosis. A strong family history of classical manic-depressive illness as described by Kraepelin is another clue. Most diagnoses of childhood mental ilnesses are fuzzy. (The DSM criteria have aroused a lot of sharp satirical comment). One result is that that a lot of the medication use is empirical \\"let's try this and see.\\"<BR>    The Papalos's also emphasize the possibility that treatment of depression with an anti-depressant drug can precipitate mania. This can happen in adults but its implications for treatment are controversial. <BR>     They tend to be over-optimistic about the effects of many anti-convulsant drugs and perhaps give too much credence to single reports of spectacular improvement.<BR>     I appreciated their harrowing but warmly sympathetic  descriptions of life with a severely mentally ill child and how to cope with the well-meaning (or ill-meaning) critics who say things like \\"give him to me for a week and he'll be different child.\\" <BR>    It's a very practical book for parents in the the United States in dealing with questions like the costs of treatment. The advice about gaming the system and the the complexities of IDEA and IEP etc is particularly good although it is so detailed and specific that it would not help much in other countires, even Canada.	2004-06-05

No need to worry about insulting them because they're watching football on television, not reading Amazon.com reviews. Sanditon, The Watsons, and At Lady Susan's are not mentioned but otherwise each character and each episode bears a subtle relationhip to a Jane Austen book. <BR> If you want to cheat a little and pretend (I don't know who to) that you know every character I might tecommend Glenda Leeming's \\"Who's Who in Jane Austen and the Brontes.\\" To be prefectly (more or less) honest I kept Leeming by me as I read Fowler.<BR>   There's a character who has read The Mysteries of Udolpho but never read Pride and Prejudice, and someone serves red varietal California wine in thick facetted glasses, but otherwise no terribly shocking incidents or violence. I found myself critical of calling Jane Austen \\"Miss Austen\\" which would have been Cassandra's title, but then I found it was Karen Joy Fowler's character doing that, not Ms. Fowler (and then I remembered that Emma is Emma througout Emma). It's the sort of book that gets you mixed up like that, between what is reality and what is fiction and what is fiction about fiction.I think that's something to do with meta-fiction and post-modernism (or po-mo as a character calls it).<BR>    Je me defie de Prudie mais je ne crois pas que je m'en suis trompe (Should that have a subjunctive?

Experts may reasonably differ, as did some of the experts she talked to, about whether the case was one of bipolar disorder or of schizophrenia. Treating a bipolar patient with anti-depressants alone is often stated to be undesirable because of the danger of precipitating mania, but the practice has its advocates. O'Malley does not make Dr Saeed sound like an empathetic character with good verbal skills but that may be a subjective judgment.<BR>     She skates over the decision by the Yates's to have a fifth child. Rusty Yates has been much criticized for this. Dr. Starbranch made a written note that a further pregnancy would guarantee another psychotic episode but we do not know what she said to Rusty Yates about it.<BR>   I cannot imagine tolerating the practices she describes at Devereux. Of course O'Malley's description is based on a a written record that may not have reflected all of what went on. The chart and treatment plan would normally have been reviewed by Magellan. In any inpatient facility I have known there would have been extended and worried discussions, involving social workers and nursing staff, about the fact that there were five small children at risk. On the other hand it is possible that even with such discussions the staff migh have been reassured by the fact that the husband was supportive and a grandmother was arriving who would be in the house while he was at work. (The killings took place between the time Rusty Yates left for work and the time Dora Yates was due to arrive in the morning.) <BR>    I do not feel qualified to cast the first stone.	2004-05-08

Each is an excellent piece of investigative journalism. He investigates the marihuana industry, migrant labor, and pornography, in each case using the stories of one or two individuals as a focus. There's a lot of gripping human interest, suspense-filled action, and crusading exposure of injustice. <BR>  He does have an unifying message, about the opressiveness of government, which is spelled out in a short afterword but really each piece stands alone and this affects readability. There are no cross-references between the three pieces. Taken individually each one is great. Advocates for marihuana legalisation will cheer through the first piece but yawn through the other two.If you're a First-Amendment-loving card-carrying ACLU member you'll enjoy the third piece best.<BR>  The other problem with constructing a book in this way is that each piece is too short to give full space to opposing viewpoints. If these had been articles in Atlantic Monthly or the New York Times we would have had an interesting extra dimension. Readers' letters would have come in, with corrections and counter-arguments, and Schlosser would have replied to them. We miss this in book form.	2004-05-03

Going underground through the rock, with the filthy river bottom above us, and fish swimming in the black water on the other side of the curving tiles.\\"<BR>    The Detroit ambience is terrific, and the characteristics of each city, Smyrna, Bursa, San Francisco, New York and Berlin are deftly nailed. The history lesson is not just about the events, but is subtle and insightful about the changes in sexual mores from nineteenth centtury Turkey to 21st century Germany.<BR>    The medical details are accurate. (...) The bizarre endocrinologist at New York Hospital is based on the Johns Hopkins psychologist skewered in \\"As Nature Made Him.\\"	2004-04-18

So much of the killing went on the last few months that, even though you know the ending, you read these narratives urging the Allies to hurry up. When they took Anne Frank they could hear the sound of the British guns in Amsterdam. Mysteries remain. I found no fresh revelations that were not in Trevor-Roper's \\"Last Days of Hitler.\\" Trevor-Roper actually spoke to many of those who were there and was given full access by the Allied authorities. (I haven't read Gertaud Junge's book yet.) This has the interest of being written by a German, born in 1926, but gives no inkling of what his personal feelings were as a 19 year old German at that time. It was written for German audience. The translation by Dembo is seamless and having been from from the German translated sensations find we not. The last pages contain sentences like \\"Instead what dominated the entire sequence of events and cost countless lives was an undeterred will, locked in its own mad, delusional world on the one hand, and a deeply calculated obsequiousness on the other.\\" I think that's the fault of the author's style not Dembo. An American would have said \\"these people were crazy.\\"<BR>    I'm haunted by the thought of Frau Goebbels killing her six children. A poignant detail here is the evidence that the 12 year old struggled for her life. Even more thought-provoking is the Russian soldier coming upon the children's bodies and not able to bear to look.(Those details aren't in Trevor-Roper).<BR>    Compared with Trevor-Roper this gives more detail about what went on after Hitler's death, but you might turn to the other WWII histories for that. It doesn't have De Valera visiting the German ambassador in Dublin to offer his condolences	2004-03-25

It has rather a lot about such things as vowel shifts in English between fourteen hundred and fourteen fifty. To convert someone into a Bill Bryson addict I would turn them on with one of the travel books. One thing that carries over from his other books is the British/American comparison. He is a mine of information and insights about this. It's also the only language book I've read that fully covers the dirty words and cuss words.<BR>   I don't know how the experts feel about its accuracy. I note that he describes William Jones as English. His nationality is relevant because the fact that he was a Welsh speaker was one of the things that enabled him to recognize the relationships between the Indo-European languages. On that subject I take issue with Bryson's implied endorsement of the Economist's criticism of subsidizing Welsh. If you really want to eliminate useless relics of pre-Saxon Britain why not start with say Stonehenge. You could probably save the taxpayers millions of pounds. by bulldozing the place, putting a useful road through, and selling Salisbury Plain off to developers.<BR>    I don't know about the alleged thirty Inuit words for snow. I've seen that one debunked and confirmed. Maybe Inuit in Alaska have diffrent words from ones in East Greenland.	2004-03-24

Her biological father is aloof,depressed, financially unsuccessful, and lives with her dim-witted puritanical mother in a dilapidated house in frozen Vermont. She is seduced by the fiftyish,affectionate,divorced multimillionare Ray who owns a mansion in Los Angeles (duh-ho, symbolism, a lot of symbolism is this one although the writer is but a simple actor). She dumps her younger boy friend Jeremy who is is immature and poor. By the end she has become a successful artist in San Francisco and returned to Jeremy who has become wiser and richer. There is even a suggestion that her father is going to get less depressed.<BR>     She has switched anti-depressant medication from Serzone (now taken off the market because of liver problems) to Celexa.(Forest Labs is now replacing Celexa with Lexapro).	2004-03-14

The detective is the formidable Dr Mary Finney, a yankee medical missionary. It was surprisingly readable. The prose is spare and the plotting close and yet the evocation of the atmosphere of that time and place is vivid. (Some of the casual references to the primitive nature of &quot;natives&quot; are cringe-making to 21st century sensibilities). The author's name on my copy is Matthew Head. This was a preudonym for John Canaday. I don't know if this was the well-known art critic. If so that might account for why there are only two more in the series because he later turned to writing books about painting.	2004-03-08

Do we judge them by whether or not they are true, or by whether the author is an important and interesting person, or by whether the author is a good person, or just by whether they're good as literature? Were St Augustine, Benevenuto Cellni and Rouseau telling the truth and does it matter? In some recent works, such as &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; and &quot;Memory Slips&quot; the question of veracity seems very relevant. &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; was marketed in the UK as fiction and in the US as autobiography.<BR>   Eggers pre-empts this question very cleverly by a series of witty endpapers (contents, prefaces, acknowledgements etc) that brilliantly transgress the usual boundaries between book and reader (I think this is what they call post-modernism - writing books about writing books). In the end we don't know what to think.<BR>   He has though of about everything a reviewer might say. The story acts out several fantasies. One is the desire of the child to be liberated from the parents, combined with fear of the parents dying. The love for the parents is poignant at the beginning and then as the book goes on we hear that they were unsatisfactory and abusive in many ways. The narrator is doing a better job with the younger brother. He is also acting out a Michael Jackson fantasy of eternal youth and kinship with children. He fears death and old age. His contemporaries die or become physically or mentally disabled in spite of their youth.<BR>   At the end he resolves some of these conflicts. He moves from San Francisco to New York and begins to face real grown-up life.	2004-03-05

There is a tree-hugging, save-the-endangered-species,motif. (Don't get me wrong -I love trees and whales and things). He is rather solemn and philosophical with a lot of fine writing about the wonders of nature lifting us above the mundane. Sometimes he falls into the traps of fine writing, such as impressive long lists of plants, birds and animals, and misuse of words such as \\"mesic\\" and \\"adumbrate\\". It is a mine of information which I suppose is mostly accurate although I hadn't heard before that Walsingham was a duke or that Vitus Bering was a Dutchman.<BR>    I had mixed feelings aout his attiude towards the Eskimos. His account idealizes the nomadic hunting existence and it is sometimes unclear whether he is talking about present-day Inuit or drawing upon older accounts. He only once mentions alcohol as a problem and does not mention disputes with other native Americans, even when desribing Hearne's travels.<BR>    The description is largely limited to America and the bibliography has no Russian sources. He often uses Inuit words but his review of Arctic prehistory draws only on archeological evidence and is weak on linguistics and says nothing about the Chukchi language and Asian-American language links. DNA and blood groups are not mentioned.<BR>     I wouldn't make all those niggling criticisms about what got left out if the book did not set itself a high standard of comprehensiveness. It's virtually a one volume encyclopedia of the Arctic full of fascinating facts, vivid firsthand accounts, and splendid writing.<BR>    By the way, one arctic question's been bugging me since I was ten years old (the teacher didn't know the answer then and Lopez doesn't have it). What time is it at the North Pole?	2004-02-28

A stupendous translation achievement with useful explanations of the complexities of cynghanedd. There is no parallel <BR>Welsh text but it follows the Thomas Parry edition of the Gwaith Dafydd ap Gwilym (which you can get from the UK Amazon.com site). An alternative would be the Rachel Bromwich edition with parallel texts published by Gwasg Gomer. I don't know of any translations into modern Welsh. This is very difficult Welsh and the honest truth is that much is lost in translation because so much of the artistry is in the intricate patterns of prosody, and of alliteration rather than rhyme. <BR>    I genuinely like this stuff. It often light-heartedly expresses the poet's sexual frustration as much as romantic love. It's not what you'd expect from fourteenth century Wales and the fact that it comes from that place and time probably has much to do with why I liked it.    <BR> Kingsley Amis, amongst others, suggested that there is something of the pseud about trying to read, and pretending to appreciate, medieval Welsh poetry. I suppose critics of the effort have a point. You can go to Athens, Georgia and see a magnificient replica of the Acropolis that is much better in many ways than the crumbling thing in Greece, but an irrational part of the mind tends to get more of a kick out of the twenty-five hundred year old thing. When I'm reading this,and trying to read old Welsh aloud, that irrational part of my mind is at work.	2004-02-15

I enjoyed it but it is a long densely packed 320 pages. At that length I think he could have given us a little more technology and more lucid explanation of the mathematical problem involved. I would have liked more detail of how the globes were made. Since some of them survive this should be feasible. He describes some of Mercator's predecessors and might have explained more about Ptolemy's maps. But I quibble; it's a massive achievement, lucid and enjoyable.	2004-02-08

Anyway this is a well-written book with great characters, wonderful descriptive passages and a compelling plot.<BR>   Twelve year old Astrid's mother is jailed for murdering her boy friend and Astrid enters a disastrous series of foster homes. As her misfortunes multiply she receives diabolical advice in letters from the jailed mother. The mother is a poet reminiscent of Ann Sexton, at least the Ann Sexton portrayed in \\"The House on Mercy Street\\" (Diane Middlemarch is more benign) and (perhaps) in \\"Running with Scissors.\\"<BR>    Each foster-home represents a different kind of America, from alcoholic evangelists to amoral immigrants. All are utterly convincing and vivid. It's a great story.<BR>    The only character who is not convincing is the protagonist. I know foster-children get pushed around and abused and can be defenseless victims of the system but this is an articulate, pot-smoking, condom-carrying, white teenager who has travelled the world and has highly-placed connections. When the plot demands it she is very intelligent, sophisticated, and well able to express her feelings. At other times she allows herself to be a helpless victim, like an eight year old child, unable to control her fate in any way. This is where I come to the sex bit and my censorship advocacy. The sexual desires and motives attributed to her are not plausible and owe more to adult fantasies and projections than to what goes on in a child's mind.<BR>    In one scene she is raped by a foster-father and the scene is depicted to represent the thirteen year old as a seductress who rather enjoyed it and the child molester as a rather good guy who escapes unpunished.  Am I being puritanical in objecting to this?	2004-01-19

She has a wonderful ear for the exact nuances of Rhondda speech and the dialogue is always convincing. She evokes the special way the background of rural Wales and the Welsh language merged with English immigration to form an unique way of life, a way destined to change as rapidly as it came into being.  The memory spectacles are slightly rose-tinted although she does touch on the darker side. Violence was not absent. The episode involving the poor Savoury sisters was heart-rending.

I didn't read the whole book when it first came out (some passages were familiar from, I think, Atlantic Monthly) which was 1982. I picked it up recently and got hooked by the magical prose. This man can write. I turned down pages and marked passages at first but then it became all turned down pages and marked passages. It describes a jouney around the United States, sticking to back roads and small towns. He emphasizes his native American Osage heritage and the has an anti-materialist philosophy full of yearning for older simpler times. Sometimes his antipathy to people who commit the crimes of being middle-aged or well-dressed or living in new houses seems overdone.(I wear a necktie myself sometimes and live in a New York suburb). He likes people to be old and poor and deeprooted in their environment, slightly eccentric, and passionately following some craft or traditional trade.    <BR>     On the whole his nostalgia for the good old days of 20 years previously has worn quite well. It's odd to realize that the book itself is now 20 years old.	2003-12-29

Sometimes it works, in small doses,but it reduces intelligibilty and becomes irritating over over long stretches. This didn't matter so much in the earlier Welsh's because the sheer energy of the narrative and the shock of it all carried the me along. Here there's a more complex plot to be followed and the orthographic veil is obfuscating. He remains brilliantly funny and delightfully shocking at times.	2003-12-19

(The Greekislandhopping WEB site keeps you updated anyway). It's better than ever. As before, it's not a book you need if you're on a cruise that goes to Mykonos, Santorini and Rhodes, although even then you might enjoy reading it for its wit and delightful illustrations. It tells you all about the boats themselves, as well as where they go. I hate to sit inside without a view. I like to buy a first class ticket on one of the big slow car ferries, especially slightly off season, where I can stroll on the sun deck drinking a glass of wine and watching the islands glide past.<BR>    This even covers Istanbul, which is where I went this year, more cultural, less hedonistic. The only thing Poffley might have added is that Eminonu is a busy commuter area, crowded with people during peak hours. The regular ferries are also crowded with commuters at times. The Lonely Planet Istanbul explains the deals about Bosphorus cruises (shorter is more expensive but longer is is rather too long).	2003-12-08

I feel the same about this brilliantly innovative 1939 spy thriller. I can see flaws in it which a modern writer would have ironed out. The plot is carried forward by unlikely letters and long speeches at times. Latimer is driven by his need to investigate the career of Dimitrios, and lands in trouble, but, until the taut final scenes in Paris, there seems nothing to compel him to keep going. He lacks plausible motivation. Promising characters in the earlier episodes drop out of sight. The whole thing needs tightening up and editing to bring it up to current standards.<BR>     The atmosphere of Turkey, the Balkans, Switzerland and Paris in the twenties and thirties is vivdly coveyed and there are patches of wonderful prose like the description of Madame Preveza.	2003-11-21

As a self-help book for patients I thought it was too technical in parts. Some studies of treatment are described at length complete with their statistics. The authors are somewhat inconsistent in their demands for rigorous proof of treatment efficacy. Alternative therapies, homeopathy, and things like the Feingold diet are described in a credulous way. They are also uncritical about projective tests. <BR>    They quote DSMIV as if it was brought down from Mt Sinai by Moses. Much of what it says about personality disorders is dubious. In fact. to be honest, some of these conditions are closer to misbehavior than to illness, but I suppose that's too philosophical an issue for a book like this to deal with.<BR>     They should have mentioned hotlines in their discussion of suicide.<BR>      The descriptions of etiology obscure the fact that most findings are fuzzy and inconclusive. They say the parents are not to blame then state that \\"studies have shown that approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of people with BPD have a history of being abused sexually.\\"<BR>      I thought Chapter 3 (Psychotherapy) was the best, with lucid explanations of the different approaches and a good summary of Linehan's work.

I wouldn't recommend it to a serious student. It's a book where someone is invited to England by \\"the archbishop of Cranmer\\" (I don't think she can blame that one on her proofreaders). Others have complained about the omission of Asia and Africa. In her coverage of \\"Wives in the Ancient World\\" she limits herself to the Old Testament and Greece and Rome. I suppose she had to leave something out, but she spends three pages on rehashing the story of Antony and Cleopatra with mentioning who it was that Cleopatra was originally supposed to marry. The startling identity of that intended spouse should certainly be relevant to \\"Wives in the Ancient World.\\" <BR>    Elsewhere she recounts very well known tales such as Bible stories and the plots of Shakespeare's plays at a length that I found tedious but some may find informative. Things liven up when she gets to the 19th century, and I found the narratives of pioneer and Mormon wives in the old West quite enthralling.<BR>     Her feminism comes to the fore as she describes tha latter part of the 20th century. She sees all as progress and gives no space to the conservative arguments.I found it strange that she (who has done sexual surveys herself) should recount Kinsey's fantasies in his \\"Report\\" as fact. <BR>     It's well written, readable, interesting and entertaining, but look elsewhere if you want reliable history for a term paper.	2003-11-15

It has many of the characteristics of a first novel; patches of brilliant writing,clever aphorisms, smart dialog, coming-of-age autobiography, stream of consciousness flashbacks, high moral attitudes, and poor plot structure.<BR>    What I suspect to be the basic plot is that a young American travels the world. He is monolingual,ignorant of the countries he is travelling to, takes a travelling companion and plenty of travellers' checks, makes telephone calls home to mother, crashes in a luxury hotel from times to time, meets interesting characters in hotel bars, is perplexed by finding how much richer Americans are than anybody else, and has trouble dealing with beggars, touts, salesmen, policemen and prostitutes.<BR>     Super-imposed on this are two other themes or sub-plots. He is griefstricken by the recent loss of a friend in a traffic accident. He has acquired a lot of money, feels guilty about it, and has made a vow to spend it all within seven days. He and his travelling companion are clever people who exchange smart remarks and profound philosophical reflections.<BR>    They visit Senegal, Morocco, Latvia, Estonia and Mexico. Some of the travel observations are interesting and would have been more entertaining with a less pretentious framework.<BR>     This is a review of the hardcover edition.

I read a lot of history but I've always had trouble sorting out all those Henries and Edwards in between William the Conqueror and Henry VIII and this was a great help. It goes from William the Conqueror up to 1400, which is when Henry IV bumped off Richard II. It's only 117 pages, some of which are illustrations so you just get the basic stories of the kings and queens. There's a little about Wales and Scotland but, even allowing for its brevity, Ireland is short-changed. It reminded me at times of Sellar and Yates's &quot;1066 and All That&quot; which parodies potted histories and snap judgments and I don't know what professional historians think of its accuracy, but it does the job it sets out to do.	2003-11-06

Other narrators includes a gold coin, a picture of a dog, and the multiple suspects in a murder mystery involving the illustrators of a book the Sultan has commissioned. There's an underlying theme of Turkey poised between East and West, symbolized by confict between traditional Eastern art forms and the forms of Italian Renaissance painting, while all representation of the human body is considered blasphemous by some.<BR>    It's a complex narrative that demands a lot of attention, the sort of book where somebody dons vanbraces and we're supposed to know what they are, but has its rewards.	2003-11-02

It has a special poignancy because it was built in a beautiful mountain setting in the Rhondda Valley, which had been a center of Welsh culture, pioneer socialism, and community spirit.It is the community descibed in the works of one of the greatest humorists of the century, Gwyn Thomas.Granelli nicely brings out some of the ironies with delicate touches such as the old trade unionist grandfather, the ancient Marian shrine, and hints of the dying Welsh language, now a badge of middle-class respectability so that nobody Mark knows speaks Welsh.<BR>    The scenery and ambience are beautifully described. The dialog is convincing and the plotting is plausible and compelling.  <BR>     Mark Richards is a disaffected loner who rejects school and work and survives by burglary. Eventually he finds other ways of surviving. I thought his mother and his girl friend were more interesting characters. We have met too many disaffected loners in fiction before, and he fails to stand out from the crowd.	2003-10-11

Anyone who writes about the politics and recent history of Turkey is bound to offend someone. I thought the author tried hard to present the different viewpoints of Turks, Greeks, Armenians and Arabs. The problem was that he also tried hard to be funny. Sometimes he succeeded, but sometimes the humor is at the level of the pun in the title.  There is something ludicrous about the state prescribing what clothes people must wear. All governments, including Western ones, do this to some extent. He could have made the point more effectively without playing so obviously for laughs. Many countries contain poor and backward rural areas and fundamentalist religious groups	2003-10-05

His sister had disappeared mysteriously many years previously. He finds himself suspected of his father's murder, and that his father has been a supected child molester. Much (too much) is made of the anonymity of suburban developments, and as part of this the hero remains an enigmatic character and the geographical location is uncertain. The opening is intriguing but then some of the dialog and characterization is in that surrealistic 1960's style of Gass,Pynchon,Barth and Delillo, with puzzling motivation, dream sequences, and unconvincingly eccentric characters. I was afraid it was going to be one of those pretentious incoherent Kafkaesque things but it tightens up into an intriguing and well-plotted mystery. A lot of sex of every variety, although never very explicit.	2003-09-28

It's directed at fellow professionals rather than the general public In fact the last page suggests that you can learn to do IP just by reading the book, if you started off as an experienced therapist. A caveat is that the authors say they found that those who did best on a written examination based on the book were (in the authors' opinion) the worst therapists.        IP is based on Harry Stack Sullivan's theories, so you could be a Sullivanian interpersonal therapist without being a Klermanian IP.        The Sullivanian theory was that our personality is made up of the way we react to other people. We start off with an empty slate and then people start communicating with us us and we communicate back. All mental illness was due to something wrong in the way we relate to people.       Klerman et al don't make a great deal of the theory. Their therapy (only meant for mild depression) consists of talking to patients about how they communicate. This casts a wide net and many therapists who just sit and chat with their patients will recognize the style. Underlying subconscious motives are probed for to some extent. Depressed people must be holding back their real feelings and not communicating freely. Letting it all hang out and saying what you mean is the key to happiness.      They differentiate themselves from Beck (the cognitive therapy man)by only seeking to change behavior in relation to significant people in the patient's life, but this covers a wide field. In fact a difficulty for advocates of IP is distinguishing themselves from just being nice sympathetic listeners willing to talk about problems (which is not such a terrible thing to be).        They make is sound more scientific at times by means of empty polysyllabic phrases such as \\"clarification of emotional states, improvement of interpersonal communication, and testing of perceptions and performance through interpersonal contact.\\" This sortof stuff makes the book hard going in parts.       The therapy is supposed to be short-term, and one useful chapter of the book is a summary of the rival short-term psychotherapies.       Interpersonal therapy is supposed to be better than the others because of having been tested in controlled trials. This is really the major selling point and it's one that is difficult to evaluate here. You have to check the journals. The results of the controlled trials are controversial and are more equivocal than the book indicates (It was published in 1984). Some careful and impartial evaluators have suggested that it all comes back to what Jerome Frank said years ago in \\"Persuasion and Healing\\" namely that the character and experience of the therapist is more important than the school of thought.	2003-09-09

The muck-raking journalist covering and fomenting the scandal is murdered. The Yorkshire scene with 21st century ways battling traditional mores is well done. It's skillfully plotted and the pages keep turning. I thought Cosmo Horrocks was too villainous to be true, and the hypocritical bishop and malevolent village gossip were drawn too simply. Considered as a classical whodunnit (not that there's such a thing any more) it lacked early clues. A nice cast of plausibly motivated suspects is built up but the solution comes from extra evidence supplied in the last few pages. No sex (at least not on-stage, although religious attitudes to sexuality are a strong theme)and only the minimal necessary violence.<BR>     My disappointment was that there is none of the Barnard literary humor. After \\"Death and the Chaste Apprentice\\" about the Restoration drama \\"said to be the work of two hands, but probably only half a brain\\" and \\"A Hovering of Vultures\\" about Bronte fanatics this was fairly run-of-the mill.	2003-09-07

Originality is the soul of wit. The updating consists of adding a lot of sex and violence, which doesn't bother me so much because of any puritanical beliefs but because it is gratuitous and indicates that the author could not think of any better way to update.

I re-read this book recently, together with Jules Masserman's \\"Sexual Allegations and Social Turmoil\\".

It is very well written - far better than Masserman's book.          Reading it this time I concluded that Noel's recovered memories of childhood [physical] abuse were obviously [not real]. She was duped again. <BR>    Masserman was his own worst enemy. His line of defense was \\"if Jules Masserman does it, it had to be right\\" accompanied by grandiose parading of his credentials. He denied ever taking female patients out on his boat after having admitted to it under oath.  I was not impressed by the fact that the accusations against him were multiple. This happened in the Barbara Kelly Michaels case and the Salem Witch Trials. It does not, in fact, look as if any court was ever convinced of the [physical contact] allegations, but his treatment methods were so far out of line as to constitute malpractice. It's as if he considered such a mundane matter as keeping a record of administering sodium amytal injections beneath him. He behaved as if he were still in the sixties, when prominent psychanalysts dominated psychiatry and there was no such thing as evidence-based practice.	2003-08-25

Many depressed people have a negative self-image and are always expecting something bad to happen. Beck's theory is that this is the cause, rather than a result, of depression. The depressed make \\"depressogenic assumptions\\" and have to be shown that these are false. It sounds as if zealous Beckian therapists must spend a lot of time arguing with their patients. <BR> \\"Cognitive Therapy of Depression\\" is an excellent book, obviouly written by a wise and experienced clinician. It reads as if directed at other professionals, and is full of sound advice to them. <BR> Like other neo-Freudians (and I would classify him as a neo-Freudian) Beck recommends ignoring the patient's childhood memories. I suspect this is an effort to distinguish them from the orthodox Freudians. Sometimes it makes sense but in cases it is like \\"apart from that Mrs. Lincoln how did you enjoy the play?\\" (For example childhood bereavement is well-documented as associated with depression). <BR> I thought Chapter 10 \\"Specific Techniques for Dealing with the Suicidal Patient\\" could have been improved or else the reader referred to a general psychiatry text. The authors seem undecided as to whether they are writing a comprehensive review of how to handle the suicidal or merely giving advice about the content of therapy sessions. Suicidal risk factors are covered in an incomplete way. Suicide hotlines are not mentioned. <BR> Chapter 14 on \\"Technical Problems\\" could be read with profit by anyone who works with the depressed. <BR> Chapter 17 \\"Cognitive Therapy and Anti-depressant Medications contains a wonderfully succinct and clear summary of the taxonomy and natural history of depression. (My copy want printed in 1979 but I did not think the information was outdated). It contains a frank and full list of the kind of patient who does NOT respond to cognitive therapy, which is basically the kind of patient psychotherapists avoid. (Although in non-academic real life we do have to spend time, often a lot of time, talking to such patients and have to know how to do it) <BR> Beck and his co-authors (all male judging by their first names) write in a pleasant, readable and old-fashioned style, with frequent references to \\"our clinic\\" and an assumption that the therapist is male. Most of the advice is completely in accordance with psychodynamic technique and common sense. The warm (but not too warm) and empathetic (but not too empathetic) therapist is to let the patient talk and to be nice to to her. The talking will uncover previously unsuspected conflicts, at which point the patient may show strong emotion, which is to be encouraged because it produces \\"catharsis\\" (sic). Freudian mechanisms of defense are assumed.One case described is a woman suffering from fatigue and lack of energy, which were finally found to be due to her struggle to avoid unpleasantness in her relationship with her husband. All was well when she learned to accept his imperfections. One detects a flavor of old Vienna.<BR> The biggest selling point of Beckian therapy has been its use of controlled trials to demonstrate its superiority to other brands of psychotherapy. Controlled trials run by psychotherapists are often in the same category as Dr Johnson's preaching woman and dancing dog. The evidence is well presented in Chapter 18 \\"Outcome Studies of Cognitive Therapy.\\" Obviously you don't go to a book by Beck to get and completely unbiassed meta-analysis of the evidence for Beckian therapy, so you'd have to supplement this with following the reviews in the professional journals.	2003-07-27

Some large political questions arise. Is there a similarity between the impulses that gave rise to Nazism and the romantic patriotism of small countries? Is the insistence on separate national identity linked to the need for personal self-esteem? How desirable is the preservation of dying languages?  One fault is that Hamilton lets the political questions intrude too much. There is a long and vivid description of the Hitler assassination plot. The consciousness of Second World War enmities seems exaggerated for a child born in Southern Ireland in 1953.

Stoneman is biased in favor of the antique. Perhaps copyright problems prevented anything about the tourist scene today. He includes long and meritless extracts from such poets as John Lydgate and \\"the Cornish poet Nicholas Michell\\" (who he?) glorifying ancient scenes they had never visited. There's even a two page extract from \\"Paradise Lost\\". Milton is at least a better poet than Nicholas Michell but I share Dr. Johnson's opinion about his readability. He certainly never set foot in Turkey.<br />  I felt rather shortchanged by his reliance on translations by others, which were often into archaic English. For example there's a long passage from the Syrian (sic) \\"Romance of Alexander\\" translated by Budge (actually I think, from the Ethiopic) in 1889 into \\"as thy majesty commands\\" type English.<br />  In the introduction he makes the tendentious allegation that \\"the Turks themselves are relative latecomers to the land.\\" This is an arguable point and some discussion of the evidence for and against would have been interesting and relevant.	2003-06-26

Therefore Davies deserves an A for effort. It is well written and easy to understand.  Having said those nice things let me get to the negative stuff. It is written as a self-help book designed to be used by the &quot;patient&quot; but the sort of angry person it is written for is unlikely to buy the book and work through the exercises. (I suspect most of the copies sold are given as gifts, and more in hope than expectation).  Most angry people perceive their anger as excusable or justified. They may agree with a general description of themselves as bad-tempered but the moment is comes to discussing a specific action they justify it. Reading and working through the book demands patience and a capacity for self-criticism- rare qualities amongst the angry.<BR>     Since it is self-help book is does not discuss the issues that professionals have to deal with in coping with the angry client.<BR>     As compared with Potter-Efron's &quot;Letting Go of Anger&quot; it is about more overt anger. The Potter-Efrons take a broader view and also write about less obvious manifestations of masked hosility.  (like writing nasty reviews) They are Americans and Davies is British, with many of his examples based on British mores.<BR>    One final jab. Davies (and even more so, Peter Cooper in his inroduction) claims that these methods are &quot;clinically proven&quot; because they are based on cognitive therapy which has been  &quot;subjected to the strictest scientific testing&quot; (Cooper) but no references are given to support this. It could be argued that references are out of place in a self-help book, but then so are claims of scientific proof.	2003-06-20

William Henry Devereaux Jr is having problems with his marriage, his friends' marriages, his daughter's marriage, his parents and his prostate.<BR>   Like most professors of English in novels (and a lot of novels are about professors of English) he seems afflicted with dumb students and to be totally cynical about the whole enterprise of literary scholarship. This started, I think, with Kinglsley Amis's &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; He's out to show that he's a regular guy, something of a jock, and not like those smartypants hoity-toity academics. He dislikes his father as much for spending too time reading as for deserting his family. Like &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; this contains several farcical incidents.  I could not follow exactly what was happening in the prolonged scene where he has wet his pants and is hiding in an attic eavesdropping on a committee meeting.	2003-06-07

The deficiencies are mine, not Loh's.<BR>   It does not have a plot in the usual novelistic sense, except that it describes the events of a year. Some of the essays or anecdotes, such as the account of her relationship with a WEB magazine are linked. Her relationships with her husband and sister form leitmotifs. It is a collection of self-deprecating humorous pieces of the type one reads in in syndicated newspaper columns by such people as David barry or the late Irma Bombeck.<BR>    She doesn't succeed in making Van Nuys sound all that bad.

The authors do suggest that these survivals (which in many cases are recent re-creations of dubious historical authenticity) represent someting positive about Britain. They suggest that respect for tradition produces stabilty. They do not address the possibility that this sort of thing feeds into snobbery and class bias.<br />  I was intrigued by the strong Scottish representation and lack of anything Welsh. Symbols of Welsh identity were obliterated by the central government to such an extent that even the flag of Great Britain contains only the crosses of St George, St Patrick and St Andrew. Why was this? Wales was the one country of the British Isles to retain the primary badge of national identity, a separate language.<br />  But perhaps this taking the book too seriously. It's enjoyable and often funny and the pictures are great.	2003-05-24

The book contains quotations in French, German, Russian (in the Cyrillic alphabet), Turkish and Greek. I thought I'd caught him misquoting Pliny, but then realized he was making a Latin joke. Some of his polyglot puns are outrageous. In The Umayyad mosque in Damascus he found Ismailis and Shiites at prayer, but that the orthodox were keeping the Sunni side up.<BR>    The long digressions on obscure Arab writers and religious teachers and the intrusive parade of erudition might put some people off. It's a bit like reading Umberto Ecco where some readers, such as myself, get entranced by the writer's flattering assumption that we are as clever as he is.<BR>    He travelled rough and travelled alone. He explains at one point that he cannot marry because he is an &quot;ah, orientalist.&quot; He shows much interest in, and sympathy with, the Moslem religion but I got the impression that. like his fellow orientalist, TE Lawrence, he likes Arabs best if they are poor and rural, a faintly patronizing attitude.	2003-05-22

He returns to his country home to live with his stepmother. He befriends Joan, who lives with her alcoholic ex-minister father. His step-mother dispproves of Joan. They split up.<br />  The description of the unlikely accident and the medical details are sparse and show no evidence of research or firsthand knowledge. (This was written in 1926 and writers didn't bother much with research then). I got the impression that Green had decided philosophically how someone would react to blindness and made his character's reaction fit that preconception.<br />  It's the sort of English novel in which the only people with jobs are servants. Joan and her father live in abjects poverty (partly because of his expenditure in gin) but no one ever mentions the w- word.<br />  I think you need some previous familiarity with English writing of the period to enjoy this. The first few chapters are set in an upper class boarding school, then the scene changes to a great country house with lots of servants around. It's Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Powell territory.<br />  There are some great characters. The monstrous step-mother, blind in her own way, is a wonderful comic creation.The Prospero/Miranda relationship of Joan and her father is touching. The descriptions of rural scenes are wonderful.	2003-05-04

Tracey Spadolini is an overweight cigarette-smoking 24- year old from upper upstate New York (so far upstate it's the Midwest) in a lousy job in Manhattan trying to get her selfish, narcissistic actor boy friend to make a commitment. <BR>    I suppose by now we should stop grumbling about similarities to Bridget Jones (and, after all, there are plenty more avatars and predecessors) and accept that chick-lit is an established genre, or category, or whatever, and that some writers choose to write in it, just as they might choose to write mysteries or science fiction. It is a lowly category (as far as the TLS and NYRB crowd are concerned) just one notch above romance and glitz. This contains some wonderful passages like &quot;I focus on my beverage, attempting to stir the sweetened foam into the darker liquid below. It refuses to harmonize, clinging in wispy clumps to the wooden stirrer like the cottony clumps of maely bugs on my sickly philodendron at home.&quot;  Trying-to-lose-weight jokes have become a cliche (remember &quot;Sheena Levine is Dead and Living in New York&quot;) s but there's a twist here - she succeeeds.<BR>      The descriptions of nine hour bus rides and of her home town ring absolutely true and are often poignant and hilarious.

A police procedural with an ingenious false-confession plot involving belated revenge on school bullies. It's set in Spokane and is full of Spokane atmosphere. Spokane is apparently a place where anybody who goes away to college in the great sophisticated metropolis of Seattle is regarded as an over-educated city slicker. Nobody, including Caroline Mabry, the detective, is happy or successful. When they're not dying young of cancer or getting killed or drunk or jailed or stoned or maimed or being too fat or too short or bankrupt they're having psychological problems and worrying about conservative republicans winning elections. I believe this is known in the mystery/suspense business as transcending the genre. I myself don't always want the genre transcended but this is very well written and a compelling page-turner.	2003-04-20

The first was that he describes travel in parts of Africa chronicled by his rival in the gentle art of saying nasty things about people, Evelyn Waugh. The second was that he was revisiting places he had known intimately, 35 years ago, and I was eager to learn what reasons a penetrating intellect like his could give for what has happened in Africa.<br />  Well, he is not quite as good as Evelyn Waugh, and the reason I think, is that he is not nasty enough. The truly effective satirist holds no punches and takes no prisoners. Deep down inside , Theroux has a heart of gold, an unfortunate possession for an ironist, and he cannot entirely conceal it. Waugh was moralist too. a devout Catholic, but he never let kindness get in the way of a good savage stab. Maybe it's an Anglo-American difference, with the Americans never properly trained to be completely unpleasant.<br />  Theroux is a well qualified expert on Africa. He even has the rare accomplishment of speaking several African languages, and the range of works that he quotes indicates a full study of its history and politics. The disappointing fact stands out that liberation from European colonial rule did not produce the automatic improvement in life for Africans that we (the nice leftwing liberals) had hoped,and that's an understatement. What went wrong? He comes up with some interesting answers. I don't know if they're the right ones, but they're well worth reading.	2003-04-20

An adventure story about runaway children in Venice with some supernatural ingredients.<BR>   It's hard to predict what children will enjoy, and some of my criticisms will be besides the point if it really is popular with children. <BR>   It starts off in a detective's office where the nasty Hartliebs are looking for their nephews. Then the scene changes and we get multiple points of view. I think stories have to be SPOV or first person narrator to hold a child's attention. There is a nice build-up of suspense around the identity of the enigmatic Thief Lord who helps the boys, but then this is solved and we go off on the chase for the missing wooden wing. This comes to an involved supernatural denouement, and  <BR>then several more unconvincing and anti-climactic chapters sort out rather inconclusively what becomes of the protagonists.<BR>    Speaking as a grownup, I enjoyed the descriptions of Venice. The author's delightful (but not very child-oriented) drawing of old Venetian buildings adorn the chapter headings. It's a book you might buy for a child you're taking to Italy, which brings me to one further damning criticism - it's highly educational.	2003-04-12

Sebald overcomes that moral quibble by making his protaganist one who gradually realises what he has escaped from. <BR>Austerlitz was brought to Britain as a four year old child on one of the Kindertransports organized by Lord Baldwin. He has blotted out his earliest memories and they gradually come back to him as he leaves Wales and comes to London and then travels in Europe. He is a historian of architecture and some of his memories are reawakened by studying buildings, such as railroad stations, that he might have seen as a child (and which are illustrated by Michael Brandon Jones's superb photographs). This gives scope for display of Sebald's immense learning, and I can sympathize with those who felt the story was bogged down in details and lists and was overly erudite, but this erudition is part of the narrative. For example I checked the quotation \\"yn yr hesg ar fin yr afon\\" and found my Bible had it differently, but in a Methodist Sunday school in the 1940's they would have been using the old Bishop Morgan version, then I reread the second chapter of Exodus and caught the parallel. <BR> It should perhaps be irrelevant to the artistic standing of the book, but I don't think it is possible to read it without the fact that the author was German making some impact. The translation is amazing. The few Briticisms (such as \\"allotment\\" and \\"conjuror\\") are conistent with Austerlitz's background. The words stringing together to make overlong adjectives that we in translations from the German sometimes find we do not here encounter. When Anthea Bell meets a compound German word that is necessary to the story because it displays something of German bureaucratic character, she leaves it in the original German, and it falls perfectly into place.	2003-04-05

You came from a dysfunctional family. <BR>    That sounds flip, and I hasten to say that this is an excellent book. Many women have found it helpful. I've bought extra copies to give to people, which is the highest compliment an author can hope for. <BR>    It's very well written, with vivid case vignettes that read more like the work of an accomplished novelist than medical case histories. (She not merely describes the physical appearance of her clients but the scenery around as she talks to them). It's really a piece of literature rather than of scientific psychology, and perhaps should only fairly be judged on that basis.<BR>     Scientifically it falls short. The theoretical basis is psychodynamic, with a bias to transactional analysis. She attempts to show that the tendency of women to become disastrously involved with the wrong type of man is a disease with characteristics similar to alcoholism or drug addiction. It is due to coming from a dysfunctional family, but the definition of a dysfunctional family is so broad that her theories beome untestable. Sometimes she makes specific testable statements (e.g that nearly every woman with an eating disorder is the daughter of an alcoholic) but does not back them up with any statistics or references to published experiments.<BR>      Her treatment recommendations sound reasonable and in accordance with common sense but they are not backed up by any objective evidence of their effectivenss.(Zero-tolerance hardline methods for dealing with physical abuse are not mentioned). Perhaps she has published objective evidence elsewhere and of course many would argue that the testimony of the women who have found this book useful is evidence enough.	2003-03-31

She exposes herself to the wrath of Janeites for her temerity and to the the barbs of critics who ridicule her aspirations to comparison.(She also deprives herself of the fifth star that must be reserved for the Mistress). <BR>   Stacie Temple lives in Manhattan instead of Longbourn, is based in Thongs.com instead of the Bennet household, aspires to stock options rather than inherited estates and seeks sexual congress rather than marriage. For reasons that were not entirely clear to me (something she read on a WEB site)  she must obtain her goal within a year. Each attempt is met with frustration (in many <BR>senses of the word) under Feydeau farcical circumstances. The financial sub-plot runs separately and involves stratagems to keep  Thongs.com solvent.  <BR>     The rather explicit sex may be distasteful to Jane Austen fans, but perhaps I am stereotyping,and virtue does remain intact (Perhaps Clarissa, as well as Pride and Prejudice, was a model)<BR>      Frankel seeks to entertain rather than enlighten us, and thereby exposes herself to a further peril. The serious writer who wants to plumb the depths of the soul, expose corrupt governments,  fight racial discrimination, or whatever, can afford (if not enjoy) rejection by readers who can be dismissed as unworthy to appreciate great art. For the writer who wants to entertain there is no appeal from the verdict of \\"I didn't like it.\\"<BR>      I liked it.	2003-03-24

This is such a wonderful book that it seems churlish to bring up the veracity question, but it is a question that must arise in dealing with these memoirs of horrific childhoods because they often bring up important issues of how to help such children. How can we defend the gay teenager from persecution? Does being permissive about teen-age sexuality lead to sexual exploitation? Does the Ronald Laing type of psychiatrist do any good?<BR>    When the author refers to Dr Finch being found guilty by the Americam Medical Association on charges of insurance fraud I suppose it's the kind of inaccuracy that might be just due to careless research.<BR>    The Anne Sexton parallels need further explanation. Some who have written about this book suggest that the remarkable resemblance is because Augusten's mother modelled herself on Anne Sexton. However Sexton died in 1974 and the biographies that described her behavior were not written until years later. Searching for Mercy Street was published in 1994. The action of this book takes place in the late 1970's. (At the age of 15 he watches Princess Diana's wedding, which was 1981).<BR>     Consider the Christmas tree scene in Linda Gray Sexton's book that begins \\"a thick symmetric tree tall enough to brush the rafters of the cathedral ceiling.\\" Burroughs has \\"the tree nearly reached the top of out seventeen foot ceiling.\\" Episode after episode about the mother has these Anne Sexton similarities.	2003-03-20

The story of an interrelated group of South Bronx welfare mothers, addicts and criminals, studied over a ten year period. It's well written and of particular interest to those of us who come into contact with such characters, either through our work or just from living in the New York area.  A certain monotony does creep in as pregnancy succeeds pregnancy and lover succeeds lover and the number of characters gets confusing. Looked at purely for entertainment value, if you're a farmer in Iowa, it's got limitations. In some ways it reads like an anthropological treatise. I was reminded of Oscar Lewis's  \\"Children of Sanchez.\\"<BR>     Does this book help us to understand why these people behave as they do? The theories conflict. Is it the result of welfare payments or of poverty? Is it the result of the presence of drugs, or the laws against drugs? LeBlance refrains from giving us answers. She makes us understand how difficult it is to get out of this life once born into it. It would have been interesting if she had told us more about the first delinquent generation. Why did Lourdes and Foxy come to the mainland United States? How did Lourdes's family in Florida keep her off drugs? I kept thinking of the elderly Puerto Rican lady who once told me how free of crime   her island used to be, and that doors were never locked.

I'm not entirely convinced she was entirely innocent.<BR> As far as I can see Bill McDougal was a man who recklessly borrowed money to gamble on real estate deals. She says she got involved in this because she was entirely under Bill's influence. Some of the borrowing was illegal, using his political influence. One illegal borrowing was from the government, the Hale loan. In the case of the Hale loan she walked off with a check for $300,000 made out to Susan McDougal.<BR>     On the other hand the punishment she got for that was excessive and unjust. The jailing for her silence before the grand jury was outrageous. It remains to be seen whether the circumstances of her imprisonment were deliberately made harder by Kenneth Starr. Her account of her time in jail is riveting and inspiring - the best part of the book.	2003-03-06

It can't quite make up its mind (or Cooper couldn't) whether it's a novel or a collection of stand-alone but interconnected short stories. If you read it straight through some of the stories are repetitious. He has a recurrent theme of people forming relatioships that fail.<BR> I kept making comparisons and they were all just a little unfavorable. \\"The Corrections\\" came to mind, of course. Franzen used the multiple points of view of family members but had an unifying plot that kept us turning the pages. \\"Comfort Zones\\" by Pamela Donoghue did a better job of linking stories about a family. Cheever does better on depicting Connecticut prosperous suburbanites. Janet Evanovich does better on depicting smalltown ethnic blue-collar hardscrabble, which brings me to the lack of humor. Cooper seldom cracks a smile. His one attempt at Yiddish oysterism fails. Updike in \\"S\\" did a hilarious job on the arrogant philadering doctor. (It's notable that these days Arrowsmith has become Babitt. The medical profession has now declined so far in literary esteem that it's become a paradigm for greedy unimaginative careerism. Cooper uses this three times).<BR> He's a talented writer who lacks, in this book, a certain spark of originality. The spark does emerge (if that's not a mixed metaphor) at times in his later collection of short stories. There's been nothing since. We can still have hope.	2003-02-25

It is a great novel but I have some sympathy with those reviewers who thought they were seeing the emperor's clothes. Some of its greatness lies in its originality. It was brilliantly original in 1922. At that time the typical Anglo-American novel was a baggy monster full of long-winded digressions, unlikely coincidences, stilted speech, arch facetiousness, and melodramatic adventures. (There were exceptions, and the French and Russians were doing better). <BR>    Woolf was experimenting with a new way of structuring a novel, using multiple points of view (she was inexpert at this and the shifts are often confusing) and letting the action of the plot take place in the minds of her characters. The sexual relationship between Clarissa and Sally is delicately but unmistakably hinted at.<BR>    I suppose in a way I'm saying that a classic is entitled to be difficult to read. Michael Cunningham's \\"Hours\\" is easier going for a modern American reader, but the genius of Michael Cunningham lies partly in his ability to see and illuminate for us the genius of Vitginia Woolf.	2003-02-21

It centers on a high school reunion in a small town in the upper Midwest. A death ocurred thirty years previously and the circumstances of that death are mysteriously re-enacted. Partly because they're all middle-aged mid-Westerners (do I put capital letters in the right place?} the large cast of characters gets confusing but after the first hundred pages I figured who was who and then it rapidly accelerates into a page turner (but without any major violence)  towards the end.	2003-02-14

A fascinating book for history buffs and professionals, although maybe hard going for the general reader. It's wrong to criticize an author for not writing a different book, and this is a biography rather than a history of maritime technology but I felt shortchanged in the scientific history department. Why were the Portuguese able to make these voyages at this particular time? He mentions the caravels as better able to sail close to the wind than were purely square-rigged ships but does not say when and where they were developed or what the evidence is that this was a major development. Did anyone in Portugal possess any kind of sextant? Did the King really have \\"a court astrologer\\" ? Did Henry have access to the Majorcan maps? I'd like to have known more about these, and how they were circulated. <BR>     Sir Peter's main message is debunking. He wants to show that Henry was a narrow-minded incompetent, literally Quixotic, medieval bigot and not a scientifically curious Renaissance man. He holds no punches about his involvement in the slave trade.<BR>      Without endorsing post-mortem psychanalysis it seems strange that the author so resolutely withholds comment on Henry's celibacy and relationship with his adopted heir, while freely speculating about his motives in other areas.<BR>      I was puzzled about the fate of Henry's brother Don Pedro. Regent of Portugal. The table at the front shows that he was killed in 1449, and on page 357 of my paperback edition we are told that Henry contributed to his death, but no details are given. Did I miss something?	2003-02-04

It's the story of Alfred Lambert's descent into dementia and the attempts of his family to cope with the old tyrant's decline. Enid, his wife, focuses her energy on bringing her reluctant children back home for Christmas. Much is made of the contrast between the connservative mid-west and the liberal east. You can even feel that the chapters set back in St  Jude are reminiscent of the American novelists of the first part of the twentieth century, Sinclair, Veblen, Cather, Dreiser, Fuller, while the chapters in the suburban east have touches of Updike and Cheever. One senses the &quot;great American novel&quot; urge (That's not altogether a compliment). Anne Tyler was the author I was most reminded of.<BR>     The humor is best when he describes small domestic details, such as the chaos in an old house inhabited by an elderly couple. Chips, the failed academic son has farcical adventures in which Franzen takes aim at targets that have been hit too often before, like post-modernist literary criticism. Gary is the materialist son ith the business career and three children. Denise is the daughter with a with an even more successful career who earns her parents' disapproval by divorce and childlessness.<BR>      There's lot more to it than that, a whole lot more, 587 pages, but, with the exception of the episodes with Chips in Lithuania, I didn't think it rambled or was overlong or baggy. Oddly enough, Enid's pressure to get everyone together for Christmas holds the narrative together and keeps up tension better than a more melodramatic device would.	2003-01-26

The jokes were often corny and the characterization crude but the mixture worked. In this one there are a number of highbrow references and Brother Verber reveals a childhood trauma that may account for his character flaws.  Even the relatioship between Raz and Marjory is getting more psychologically complex. Where is all this leading? I'll keep reading to find out.	2003-01-21

Her brilliant sanctimonious husband is ulimately unmasked as the real source of the family's dysfunction.<BR>   Kinsley has mastered some of the most difficult parts of fiction but fails some elementary tests. He gives us page-turning narrative, believable dialogue, and excellent climactic confrontations. On the other hand his opening chapters are bogged down by tracts of exposition and telling-instead-of showing that could have been edited out and redistributed.The text is replete with cliches that could easily have been expunged;debate is heated, announcements boom, holidays have highpoints, rules are unwritten, a suitor pops the question, and  mountains are majestic and covered with a thick blanket of snow.<BR>   A major flaw is the use of identical twins separated in babyhood as a plot device. This can happen in real life, and Shakespeare got away with using it in a plot, but here it introduces implausibility that detracts from the compelling major plot theme.<BR>   Excellent Maryland and Wyoming atmosphere and good descriptions of telescope-making, skiiing and sex.	2003-01-16

As Sugrue says \\"Every time we look for somebody we find them dead.\\" Not only do they find them dead but they get accused (sometimes justifiably) of killing killing them.

I think it is often easier to parade one's own  wide reading than to recognize someone elses's references. These editors track down the most obscure of Greek, German and Latin quotations and it's an education to read their notes.<BR>   There are really three themes in the book. One part is philosophy, one is literary criticism, and one is straight autobiography. These are dispersed throughout. <BR>    As regards the philosophy I am probably what he would have called &quot;ignorant of his understanding.&quot;  Coleridge shows a remarkable knowledge of German philosophy, read in the original language. As far as I know his philosophical ideas have not been highly regarded by pure philosophers.<BR>     The literary criticism is the most powerful and original part although the texts he uses will be unfamiliar and even anaccessible to most modern readers.<BR>     The fragments of autobiography such as chapter 10 and the first of the Satyrayane's Letters are the most readable.<BR>    While this is an unboubted work of genius I have denied it the fifth star because of a certain lack of redability. It is not, for the modern reader, a page-turning work of entertainment. It contains many gems, and much wit, but is one of those we take up today for instruction rather than diversion.	2003-01-12

The usual Maggody misadventures and murders familiar to all ardent Hessians take place.<BR>   I think this is a series that gets better as it goes on. There is a certain crudity and dependence on cliches and stereotypes in the earlier character drawing. The fat girl Delia is greedy; the preacher is a hypocrite. The later ones have more subtlety. <BR>    \\"She had her cat, Pussy Toes, her apartment in a quiet neigborhood, her meetings of the genealogical society, her knitting projects for nieces and nephews, and her annual vaction to a family-run hotel in Mexico where she remained drunk out of her mind for ten days straight.\\" You might accuse Hess of making fun of alcoholism in that portrait of Miss Vetchling but it has a certain style and sharpness.	2003-01-09

Much of what he says is well justified but, considered as entertainment, it was so full of grouching about the adverse effects of everything on the environment that it ended up with too many sour notes. <BR>    I was struck by how close his moral attutudes were to those of the early missionaries he describes. He extols the virtues of mortifying the flesh, and relishes describing the hardships he has inflicted on himself. He keeps encountering residents who do not share his beliefs about how life should be lived. They commit such crimes as fishing and using toilet paper. They are not the original inhabitants of the country.	2003-01-02

An obnoxious, conventional, and relatively wealthy, young Englishman encounters a group of unconventional cosmopolitan artists and bohemians. He disapproves of them at first and then becomes seduced by their life-style. They take his his money and leave him. He degenerates into alcoholism. <BR>   It's a mildly entertaining amateurish attempt to imitate early Aldous Huxley, Evelyn Waugh and Norman Douglas. The shadow of Hitler looms. Some of the writing is so clumsy that I wondered if my copy (a Persea 1981 reprint) had proofreader's (really non-proofreader's) errors. For example: \\"The principle of polite society, that unknown here; people appeared to grudge one of causing pleasure and avoiding pain, seemed second's agreeable intercourse and atone for it with unremitting rudeness.\\" Does that make any sense? I wondered about \\"mentula moechia.\\"  Is there such a Latin word as \\"mentula?\\"<BR>     The strange thing is that the author was regarded as one of the great literary figures of the century. Why? This was his only novel. His other books were a book telling people how to write books and a book of literary criticism.<BR>      Another puzzle is that Cyril Connolly claimed it was rejected for publication because it was considered obscene. People go to bed with people they're not married to, but no details are given of what they do. There isn't a single naughty word. It's implied that some characters are homosexual.   <BR>      I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it. It has some interesting insights and well-written parts, but why is Connolly considered so great?	2002-12-29

We follow five years of his life, during which he gets married and has a child.  That's the unifying story but there are several distimct plots going on.<BR>   The first concerns his career as a psychotherapist and a newspaper writer. This is a satirical story with echoes (perhaps deliberate) of Waugh's &quot;Scoop.&quot;  One problem here for me was that I'd recently been reading Scoop. Although Chalmers's jokes are often quite good, Evelyn Waugh's seventy-year old jokes are funnier.<BR>    The second concerns his love affair with the adventurous, much more self-assured, promiscuous American girl, Laura. This is poignant and tragic.<BR>    Laura's relationships with her Babbitt-like parents and her lonely, misunderstood, unsuccessful brother is a third plot.<BR>    Interspersed with these are multiple anecdotes and farcical incidents concerning a large number of other characters. Flashbacks and changes of narrative point of view add to the confusion and prevent this from being a page-turner.      <BR>    It contains lots of excellent writing and sharp observation but the cook has failed to blend the ingredients.	2002-12-26

You meet some characters from his other books. This added to the pleasure for me but I don't know if it's the one I would recommend to someone who'd never read any Waugh before. It also helps if you know something about the 1930's British literary scene and can recognize who is being satirized. Parsnip and Pimpernell are presumably Auden and Spender. I've heard of various candidates fir being Ambose Silk.	2002-12-24

Books about this usually contain certain predictable themes. The  writer is usually English or American, doesn't have a regular job, and the natives among whom he lives are lovable eccentrics with fractured English. It's commonly an island, or somewhere remote and warm, and when we next read about the writer he's no longer living there. (Jan Morris points out of these cliches in her or his introductory essay, &quot;Some Thoughts from Abroad&quot;) <BR>   Some of the pieces fall into these obvious categories but one writer is Indian, one Welsh, and one South American. In three of them the foreign country is the United States. Others are set in the Philippines, Paris, Provence, Italy, Kenya, Singapore, Mexico, Ireland, Morocco, Japan, China, Egypt, Thailand, Turkey and Greece. Tragedy strikes in two of them but the mood is mostly light-hearted and humorous. I enjoyed them all.

He has a one-night stand with a woman whose husband he fears is seeking revenge on him. His wife's family keep nagging him to get a job and a hair cut. It doesn't have much plot although it's full of incidents and digressions. Clay is involved in various strategies to get money. He has intellectual interests and may be writing.<BR>   The main attraction is the quality of the writing. This is witty and erudite but prolix, and demands close attention. The humor, although often ingenious, becomes somewhat repetitious by the end. The plumbing of the Gorbals was very primitive and this gives rise to recurrent scatological themes.	2002-12-21

First of all it deserves 5 stars because it's magnificient entertainment and well written. For some reason the lives of poets make much easier reading than does their work. I have to confess that on my shelves sit well-thumbed biographies of Dylan Thomas, Anne Saxton, George Barker (Fraser's \\"Chameleon Poet\\") Coleridge, Shelley and Byron, but not a single volume of their work (except \\"The Bell-Jar\\" and \\"Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner.\\") <BR>   Ted Hughes was married to Sylvia Plath. She killed herself, possibly because of his affair with Assia Weevill. Assia had his child, Sura, then killed herself and the four-year-old Sura. <BR>    Of course he is not to blame for these suicides, but was his conduct good? I am struck in this biography. which is written from a pro-Hughes standpoint, by his behavior towards the children. After their mother's death the nine year old and eleven year old were packed off to boarding schools so that their father could have \\"more time to think and work.\\" Feinstein does not comment (and perhaps comment is superfluous) on the poignant irony of his Jewish child being gassed ( I only hope and pray that she died before her mother did). Feinstein throws in a suggestion that Sura was brain-damaged but gives no more details. This is all the more relevant because his often-stated reason for withholding material from bioraphers was to protect his children. If he had nothing to hide then why withhold? <BR>      From this account it seems that Hughes became rich and famous mostly because of having been married to Sylvia Plath. He might have been a notable poet, which might have made him famous, but even the most notable poet barely makes a living. His poems that were best-sellers were \\"The Birthday Letters.\\" He was Plath's legal heir and received the royalties fron \\"The Bell Jar.\\"  <BR>      Feinstein seems to have had access to some of the medical records on Assia ans Sylvia. Both took anti-depressant medications;it would have been relevant to tell usmore about these.  Both women died by gas poisoning. Did British household gas supplies still contain carbon monoxide at that time? These are details a biographer should have researched. My next reading stop will be Alvarez's \\"Jealous God.\\"	2002-12-18

It is funny, but in the darkest of ways. I notice that others have used the words \\"gruesome\\" and \\"mordant\\" which are certainly appropriate. \\"Sick\\" would be another word. Children commit suicide, or are sexually molested or beaten. A cat's eye is torn out by a rat. A woman kills the cat to spite her husband.<br />  Some of the humor comes from characters talking to each other with exaggerated formality. It's trick borrowed from Ivy Compton-Burnett and sometimes these dialogues and speeches go on too long and the joke palls. Otherwise it's impeccably writtem by a master of the English language.	2002-12-14

These are juvenilia in which some seeds of the later Evelyn Waugh can be seen. Some of the short stories are amusing in the way of Saki or Roald Dahl, with ironic twists in the tail,sharp satire, and dark humor. The longer title story could be read as autobiographical.

In this one a lot more about her origins turns up. It's set in 1987 with Kinsey now 36.The action of P is for Peril took place earlier in the same year.(A is for Alibi was published in 1982).<BR>   Compared with other Graftons this is more of a police procedural, centering on discovering the identity of an unknown girl whose body had been found 17 years previously.<BR>   Although I'm a devoted fan I can understand the objections of those who crtiticize her for slowness. She loves to set every scene in detail, and whenever Kinsey travels from one place to another the journey gets described. For example you get passages like &quot;I parked in the lot in a space marked VISITOR. I locked the car and trotted across the flattened grass to the entrance, pushing through the double glass doors and into the main corridor...&quot; Elmore Leonard would have had his character in and out of that building by now, but I wouldn't want Grafton writing any differently; the result of all that describing is complete and vivid realism.	2002-12-12

The elements of a plot come briefly in between prolonged and graphic (and well-written) descriptions of sexual acts. In fact I think the real plot is the old basic story of the woman who sacrifices all for the sake of love with a worthless man. In the older stories this was romantic love; here it is physical desire. Vangie (the narrator) and Del have nothing else in their young lives (except alcohol and drugs). No parents are functioning. When they are not in jail or rehab they are waitresses of factory workers. In the end Vangie survives and leaves Del and we have a feeling she may be going on to a better life (she is still in her teens). Meanwhile her best friend June fares even worse with her boy friend Ray. That affair ends in shocking violence which is the spur to Vangie's escape.<BR>    Come to think of it, puritans might find a moral in this, but they would not have read so far.	2002-12-05

The body of the young Mormon missionary isn't found until page 109, although we're told on page one that he's going to be the victim. I think we're supposed to be reading this for the South Dakota small town atmosphere, which is well described, and for the overweight overworked waitress heroine, who is a great character. Some good sex scenes (try page 146). <BR>    Plot believability is a problem, not so much in the main plot as the sub-plot.

To do this he has to introduce some stereotypes and cliches that become implausible at times. His hero is a twenty-year old who has backpacked solo around Europe but is also a community college dropout whose ambition is to become a corporate executive. His femme fatale is a French girl who has her own apartment in central Paris but is eager to live in California and lies and cheats to get a green card. His mother is a hippy who has done drugs and eats health food. His father is a marihuana-growing recluse.<BR>     Updike was a lot more subtle and realistic in drawing these contrasts between generations in the Rabbit stories.<BR>     Two pages are devoted to describing the hero's shampoos, again with the idea of showing how in tune with the zeitgeist he is, and the language becomes convoluted in an attempt to be contemporary: \\"the zombie-grade preshampoo and revitalizer, part of my shampoo museums's Medieval and Sci-Fi section.\\" <BR>     Pieces of philosophizing about life are interspersed.<BR>     This all sounds negative it's an interesting concept, funny and thought-provoking, with patches of quite brilliant writing.	2002-11-30

From there on it's a  comic mystery. The information about the Seventh Avenue and Greenwich Village fashion scene was interesting. There's a wonderful snooty law firm that presents a facade of upmarket efficiency but where nobody really knows what they're doing. (She fakes her way into a job there and pretends to be operating a computer). I was reminded of Sparkle Hayter by the downtown Manhatten milieu, and, to be honest, by the tendency to substitute eccentricity for characterization. (\\"Slaves of New York\\" had another Greenwich Village hatmaker). <BR>     The plot is fantastic but tight and logically coherent.<BR>I enjoyed this and will be looking for more.

Firstly doctrines of the Gnostics are reconstructed from the viewpoint of those who wrote againsts them, such as Ireneus. These early anti-heretics were for most of the last two millenia our only source of knowledge about the Gnostics. The second part consists of writing by the Gnostics themselves unearthed around 1900 at Nag Hammadi in Egypt and written in Coptic.<br />  The Nag Hammadi writings contain sayings attributed to Jesus that are not identical with those in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. These collections of sayings have sometimes been referred to as Gospels, most notably the Gospel of Thomas, although they do not contain anything like a biography of Jesus.<br />  This raises a problem for Christians who believe in the inerrancy of scripture, although none of the sayings contradicts what the Bible says. Conservative Christians, and, I think, the Roman Catholic Church, reject the possibility that the Gospel of Thomas is a old and as authentic as the New Testament. Many scholars believe that they may be from sources as close to Jesus as our Four Gospels are.	2002-11-24

Actually you don't get a lot of extra detail about Arly Hanks that you wouldn't have figured out from the later books. This is not a roman fleuve (pardon my French) like, for instance, Sue Grafton's alphabet series that we read almost as much to follow what will happen next in Kinsey Milhone's life as for the plot of the individual book. <BR> The series is set in a a small town in the Ozarks, populated by simple country rubes, where Arly Hanks, a displaced and divorced New Yorker is chief of police. The stories are told partly in the first person by Arly but switch to other characters' points of view. There are the usual faults that we criticize Joan Hess for. Delia is funny because she is fat and eats a lot. Brother Verber is funny because he is a blatant hypocrite. I suspect that Hess is faux naif (French again) and the cartoonish drawing of supporting characters is a deliberate ploy to fix the town of Maggody in our minds. She never makes any bones about saying what a depressing place Maggody is, and often describes stark tragedy, yet the effect is somehow cheerful and reading a Magoddy book is a delightful relaxation.	2002-11-18

(For example I recently read Dudman's \\"Augusta Gone\\" which gave a heart-rending account of a suicidal teenager with no mention of anti-depressants). The afterword and epilogue are a fair but incomplete summary of the status of medication in treating depression, and the legitimacy of \\"depression\\" as a medical diagnosis.<BR>    It's well written, although somewhat repetitious. I think it's too long and complex to be a self-help book for someone in the throes of severe depression. I think it would be useful for a family member or friend, or for someone already being helped by medication. It's not a complete case history. We are left uncertain as to how continuous the illness was, the role of illicit drug-taking, what her father's psychiatric condition was, and whether any anti-depressants (such as desipramine or trazodone which she later took) were used before Prozac. The author makes her own diagnosis, which I wouldn't want to comment on.	2002-11-17

I bought this on the strength of the New York Times rave review and was not disappointed. It's in the &quot;dirty realism&quot; and minimalist tradition of Raymond Carver, Russell Banks and Bobby Anne Mason.<BR>  I thought the first and the last were the best. In &quot;Magic&quot; a man living alone in a trailer, afflicted by alcoholism and depression, is uplifted by a momentary contact with an autistic child. The protagonists (I can't say heroes) of the title story live in a Salvation Army hostel. The Times quoted the marvellous ending, but I can't resist doing it again. It's a masterpiece of using, and even repeating, the simplest of words. What a writer, what a genius, this is. The narrator is imagining a better life: <BR>    &quot;My heart flutters with the idea of it all. This little kid's got a nice room with a nice bed and a thick pillow and a quilt.He's got a nice father and a nice mother. He's comfortable and he's not fat and when he lies down nothing comes up in his throat.&quot;	2002-11-08

Unlike Sedaris he does not admit to being gay, although the most constant of his torments is the accusation of effeminacy. In a way that's a strength, because it gives the book more universal appeal. All children fear being different as they make that transition from home to the outside social world. Even attributes that others might consider enviable, such as being tall or having big breasts, can be come the focus of fear of ridicule.  <BR>    Are things any different now? Is enough being done to protect children against this sort of thing?	2002-11-04

I won't give that away. <BR>    George Barker was once considered (by such people as Yeats and TS Eliot) to be a major poet of the twentieth century. Then his reputation took a mysterious nose-dive. In spite of that he continued to insist that a real poet should not deign to take a regular job and he never did. He also fathered fifteen children.<BR>    It all makes a great story, even if you've never read a line of George Barker (these days very few people have) and it's wonderfully told by a great story-teller.	2002-10-30

This is a good antidote to the travel bug, as it describes the discomforts of no star hotels and slow trains in Italy. Turkey, Greece and Egypt with a pregnant mate. (Like other reviewers I'd love to hear her side of the story but it may be a deliberate part of Perrottet's artistry that we are left largely to imagine this).<BR>   As the title suggests, the theme is ancient Roman tourism, about which he is knowledgeable and entertaining. He is linked to these lands by being a classical scholar and the grandson of an ANZAC hero killed at Gallipoli. These two things separate him from the mere purveyors of comic travel anecdotes in the tradition of Mark Twain's &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot; but he is also tremendously funny. He is a master of the &quot;didn't seem funny at the time&quot; story, like the description of the Egyptian train journey and the telephone calls about disasters in his New York apartment.  <BR>     A nice last sentence.	2002-10-26

Actually,for those who wept that there were no more Waughs to conquer,he uncovers some obscure writings and some differences between editions that are more radical and more interesting than such textual variants usually are.<BR>    Only the first section and the bits about the early novels live up to the promise of the title by relating Waugh to contemporary writers of his time. I had always been puzzled by the way that in &quot;Decline and Fall&quot; a taut, ironic, detached, witty style emerged suddenly in 1928 from the unreadable tomes of the early century when humor was arch and ponderous, description long-winded, and plots melodramatic. Genius is the primary explanation of course but Davis puts it into context and I shall be scouring the used book areas for some of the avatars and exemplars he mentions.<BR>     Later on he loses track of this theme of relating Waugh to his contemporaries. Just every now and then he reminds us that that is what he is supposed to be doing. There is a discussion of &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; in relation to &quot;All the King's Men.&quot; Warren did not read Waugh and Waugh did not read Warren. At the outset Davis says &quot;any thread of external evidence linking them is rather tenuous&quot;  Well - yes.	2002-10-14

The description of the church on page 2 and the breakup of ice on the Hudson on page 256 are among the finest pieces of English prose I've read. <BR>   Of course these memoirs of terrible childhoods demand to be judged by other criteria. One problem is always whether they are true. This seems to have good collateral confirmation. An unique feature is the sympathetic attempt to understand the characters and motivations of the abusers, although at the end they remain inscrutable behind the shielding mask of religious fanaticism.  <BR>   Did these children all get [messed] up? If they did was their parents fault? Is there some natural inborn resilience? Was the fact of being fourteen abusive in and of itself? <BR>   Of the two children who emerged with major psychiatric problems, one was brain-damaged and the other was away from the home for five years. Jimmy. the second of these, remains a mystery. <BR>     Were the writer's problems due to his parents? Is he that messed up a human being anyway? (A licensed electrician, furniture maker and carpenter who is a well-reviewed published writer sounds pretty successful). There's a lot of questions in there. I don't pretend to answer them, and the book doesn't answer them all, but it gives insights into them that are well worth reading.<BR>     One minor question, which may be irrrelevant. Why did the parents speak Lithuanian to each other when the father was a Russian Orthodox Ukrainian?	2002-10-08

In fact, for numbers and dates, old Sylvanus Griswold Morley is quite good (but don't let hard-core glyphies hear you say that). You can buy lots of gizmos with diagrams of the calendar round.

It's a well-written book full of interesting information and illuminating insights. My main problem was figuring out who it is addressed to. It is written with a journalist as co-author, so I assume the writers did not want to limit readership to other psychiatrists. It is certainly not a self-help book. It might be useful to some-one with a mentally ill family member, but such a person would be better off going to the NAMI web site.<BR>    The first part is an excellent history of the decline and fall of psychoanalysis and of the last 50 years of American psychiatry. Then comes a short account of neurophysiology in some technical depth. The object seems to be to show that psychiatrists are real doctors and real scientists. The authors tread on philosophical ground with their theories of consciousness. It's \\"for every twisted thought a twisted molecule\\" stuff. <BR>    Part three consists of cases vignettes of panic disorders, of bipolar disorder and of schizophrenia.<BR>   Finally come recommendations, but who are the recommendations being made to? They seem to be talking about things \\"we\\" should change. Who is this \\"we\\"? Sometimes it's as if they were talking to a group of state legislators, the Secretary of HHS, the United States Congress or the American Council on Graduate Medical Education. I suspect it is largely directed at a readership of psychiatrists. A problem (if you can call it a problem) that they discuss is the fact that the new anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs have become so free of side-effects and so easy to use that there is not as much for psychiatrists to do. Primary care doctors and RN's and (in New Mexico) psychologists can prescribe them.  That leaves psychotherapy, but why would psychiatrists be any better at that than somebody without an MD? It's an interesting question but a full answer would need need hard evidence. As it is, many of the assertions are subjective.<BR>      Coming back to some particular points, I wondered why,in the description of management of a patient with auditory hallucinations and delusions, no mention was made of the evidence-based techniques other that drugs. The strictures about foreign psychiatrists are not supported by valid evidence. Anti-psychotic drugs were invented in France, the use of lithium in Australia, and anti-depressants in Switzerland. How good is the evidence that specific brands of psychotherapy such as cognitive-behavioral or interpersonal are really different?	2002-09-22

I was reminded of Barthelme and the South American magic realists. Several stories involved people embarking on journeys that end disastrously, reminding me of Bowles. Two are set in Vicenza in Italy.The final novella, the one I liked best,is more realistic and is set in suburban Toronto. Even in that one &quot;The Guacamole Game&quot; there is an attempt to puzzle the reader. Rooke seems to like to keep his readers bewildered and guessing.<BR>     He has a wonderful sense of humor and I like his work best when this shows though and when he keeps his feet on the ground (if that's not a mixed metaphor).	2002-09-18

The nature stories and the anecdotes about eccentric naturalists are interesting.<br />  It has a 1980 original publication date. Perhaps because of this date there is very little about DNA and nothing about HLA and tissue-typing. I shall check his later books to see if he ever got up-to-date on these. (He died a month ago). He was concerned to defend his field as being real science against &quot;haughty and high-riding mathematicians and experimentalists.&quot;  In fact this sort of biology seems more akin to history and archeology than to hard science, but that adds to its readability rather than detracts from it.	2002-09-09

He meets up with Sarah, whose father murdered her brother, and they are both stalked by Truman, who is plagued by memories of his awful childhood, by religious visions, and by toothache, which he copes with by pulling out his own teeth. It seems to be set in hill country in the American south but the location and date are vague.<BR>     At first I was put off by the language. It's written in some kind of dialect that is phonetically spelt but also contains many high falutin' words so that you have sentences like \\"If she's mine then that freshface won't a dog-lap away from my leavins\\"  and words like \\"theodicy\\" and \\"fuliginous.\\" After a while I got the hang of the language and then it was a compelling and moving story.<BR>     The least convincing character was the baby. Rooke has this newborn child laughing, gurgling, and lifting its head and crawling around.The jacket copy says Rooke has a son, but maybe he's forgotten a few things about new babies.<BR>     I bought this after having read the author's marvellous short story (called \\"How to Write a Short Story\\") in the Antioch Review.

It centers on half a summer attempting to run a taverna on the island of Patmos and getting swindled. It's light-hearted in tone but covers a few tragic events and many that must not have seemed funny at the time. It's short and unpretentious but I enjoyed it more than many heavy works that aspire to tell us significant things about the Greek soul. Many of the things he says about Greeks and how they do business are - well- unfavorable. I kept thinking that if he'd said these things about a more vulnerable ethnic group he'd have been accused of prejudice, but judging from the reviews I've seen so far, Greeks and Greek-Americans don't seem to mind.<BR>     The only recipe I've tried was the tzadziki one. It's a great advance on just chopping slices of cucumber into Dannon. I couldn't figure out what he meant by rinsing the grated cucumber. I just rolled it in a paper towel.

Those who have an interest in Dudley Mooore, John Cleese, David Frost, Alan Benett, Jonathan Miller and so forth, and who remembember Beyond the Fringe and That Was The Week That Was will find it interesting. The number of characters becomes bewildering and boredom sets in as accounts of the obscure and forgotten multiply. It livens up when it recounts some of the skits we thought funny at the time.  <BR>    It is perhaps deflating to realize that these satirical iconoclasts owed their initial careers to the British governmemt. They got their starts on the payrolls of the government-sponsored Edinburgh Festival and as employes of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Would they have fared as well in an open marketplace? Were they causes or beneficiaries of the breakdown in censorship in the 1960's? Carpenter touches on some of these questions but is, I think, too much in awe of the genius of those he writes about. While undoubtedly entertaining their talents for writing funny things and doing funny imitations were of a kind that is widespread.	2002-08-25

There are suspense-laden scuba sequences. The real killer interpolates commentary into the text.<br /> It is a well-written and ingeniously plotted page-turner and I feel churlish about denying it the fifth star, but the problem for me was a certain lack of originality. We have so many tough male private eyes. The plot involves adopted children and long-lost relatives like Ross MacDonald. The interpolated killer's voice reminds of Thomas Harris. None of this detracts from readability, so as far as entertainment value is concerned it's irrelevant, but it stops me putting Riordan in my pantheon of the great.	2002-08-21

The setting is the London music scene. Some blurbs and reviews emphasized the computer content but the only computer-related event I noticed was that someone introduces a virus to prevent a suspect erasing his files. Statistical sales projections are an element but that doesn't seem very high high-tech. It is hard-boiled with rapid action and strong hints of sexuality and violence, although by the end there has been only minor violence (the murders are off-stage) and no explicit sex. Very little humor. Nobody seems to be enjoying themselves much although they spend their time partying and clubbing and surrounded by money.

But to be honest her writing contained weak spots and cliches and her plots were sometimes threadbare. This one has much better writing and an ingenious plot. I think it's her best. It's set in Georgia instead of her usual California. Savannah has to go home for her sister's third wedding and her good-for-nothing brother is accused of murder. Some of it is gooey and sloppy and sentimental, but to complain of schmaltz in McKevett is like complaining of sweetness in a chocolate eclair.

What makes an autobiography into a compelling story is very often the struggle against adversity. It's not Dundy's fault that she was born to inherited wealth but it takes away a vital ingredient. (She never tells us exactly how much money she had, which would have been interesting, although giving uncensored details of her sex life).<br />  She did manage to create some adversity for herself to struggle against, by drinking and drugging and by marrying Kenneth Tynan. The story of the Tynan marriage is the centerpiece of the book. Of course Tynan's writing was a a theater critic and the work of even the greatest theater critic is necessarily ephemeral. He also achieved fame by his personality and was in that category of well-known for being well-known. Her own artistic achievements were three novels, one of which was a brilliant best-seller \\"The Dud Avocado\\" and two celebrity biographies (Peter Finch and Elvis Presley).<br />  Aside from the Tynan marriage most of the rest is life-style-of-the-rich-and-famous stuff, with many anecdotes about celebrities she has known that are interesting (and some were very interesting to me) if you are already curious about some of these people. For example she was close to Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, and was present at a meeting of Hemmingway and Tenessee Williams.	2002-07-30

It's heart-warming and interesting to read the acknowledgements at the end. (But then who knows? Maybe Paul Theroux in real life is a nice man and John Keahey a bad-tempered curmudgeon.) Sometimes the writing is careless, with \\"like\\" instead of \\"as if\\" (or am I pedantic to object to that) and with repetitions such the story of Hannibal's massacre of his mercenaries and the changes of name of Crotona. He is nothing like as erudite as Gissing or Norman Douglas, or at least he is more modest about his knowledge, so that you have the feeling of learning about Italian history and English literature along with him as you read. Those older writers expected you to know already about Cassiodorus and the Sybarites. In spite of his disarming modesty I still think he should have found out the names of the plants he saw. \\"Yellow flowers\\" is not good enough. For [the price]we should get some more research.<BR>    The photographs are black and whites squeezed into half and quarter pages.<BR>    It's a combination of biography of George Gissing, travelogue, and history of Southern Italy. The descripion of Naples (the only place in the book I have visited) is good but a little superfluous if you're reading this before a trip to Italy because there is already so much good writing about Naples.  More valuable for the intending traveller are his descriptions of such places as Paola, Cosenza, Reggio, Taranto, Metaponte, Copia/Sybaris, Crotone, Catanzaro, and Squillace.	2002-07-25

The Albertine episodes make more sense if we assume this is a homosexual ralationship. Albertine's independence, and her being allowed to live in a young man's apartment, and other aspects of her social life do not seem likely for a young woman in the nineteen hundreds. Marcel's (and incidentally this is the only volume where he refers to himself as Marcel) suspicions then become the gay lover's fears that his lover prefers heterosexuality. Albertine is the only female in the Recherche who never gets married. <BR>    Apart from  these external clues there is quality about the the affection Marcel feels that suggests a gay rather than a straight relationship.<BR>    This volume marks a turning point in the narrator's fascination with the aristocracy.

I am lost in admiration of the immense task of the translators but some comments are in order. They had the problem of translating slang and mispronunciations and the translations of these are often based on British usage of the 1920's. Scott Moncrieff dealt with some of them by leaving them in French. He had a style that was slightly archaic, even for his time (see his translation of the Satyricon of Petronius Arbiter, where he left the dirty bits in Latin). Some of the translations are in British English, with expressions such as &quot;lift boy&quot; and &quot;bowler-hatted&quot; that might need translation of the translation, although I suspect that the sort of people reading Proust and reading a review like this are anglophile as well as francophile.	2002-07-22

All the novels are self-contained but this is series that is well worth starting with A is for Alibi. It's kind of like reading Proust as characters reappear.<BR>     She likes to set every scene carefully. Buildings, weather, clothing, food and characters' physical appearance are all carefully described with details about how they look, how they sound and how they smell. Some readers may find this holds things up. Kinsey Milhone is put in peril at the end of each book and saved in the nick of time, and this sometimes gets implausible. The novels are all set within a fairly narrow times frame, in the 1980's (no cell phones or DNA evidence) and another implausibility is that of a private eye handling two or three murders a year, but if we worried about that we wouldn't be reading private eye stories anyway.  Otherwise a perfect writer.	2002-07-17

This is many books in one and packed with information but easily digestible - a fascinating combination of Greek history, biography of Byron, and description of the author's own travels through Northern Greece, the Ionian Islands, and Albania. It's helpful in explaining the complexities of the Greek struggle for independence (or ethnic cleansing or civil war) when they spent half their time fighting each other and where neither side was blameless. Byron's character was almost equally complex and interesting. In addition you get for your money an excellent guide to parts of Greece and some insight into the complex and interesting character of Stephen Minto.	2002-07-11

Lots of sex (which nobody seems to be enjoying very much} and violence. Wonderful use of the irony of Christmas celebration as the pitiable, half-way likeable, alcoholic, ex-lawyer goes around the strip joints and porno shops and rackets he runs for the sinister boss he is trying to double-cross.

It's more of a book for someone who has already read at least half way through A la Recherche. As a cost-effective introduction and a sort of Cliff's Notes (maybe there are real Cliff's Notes on Proust) I would recommend Time Regained (the Enright translation) with A Guide to Proust both in one volume published by Random House in the Modern Library series. One problem is that Shattuck's style can be difficult e.g. \\"We live by synecdoche, by cycles of being\\" and \\"this iridescence never resolves itself completely into an unitive point of view.\\" By the time you've read 250 pages of this you could have read a lot of Proust.<BR>    He is very kind to the Moncrieff translation, which I find too full of archaic English. He accepts without comment that Albertine is female. To me the Albertine episodes make more sense as a homosexual love affair and one Proustian I asked about this said that this was a common theory.	2002-07-01

People die in most of the stories. The general idea seems to be that they are supposed to give us insights into human nature and, to be fair, they often succeed. <BR>    No science fiction is included. The editors don't say that this exclusion is a policy.It would be interesting to know whether any was considered. Is science fiction too frivolous? For me science fiction is the genre where I am most likely to read short stories rather than full length novels.<BR>    The word \\"American\\" is broadly interpreted; two stories are set in China, one in the Himalayas, one in Wales and one in Madagascar. <BR>    It's tempting to review a short story collection by picking out the ones I like best. In this case the five stars belong to the excellent Foreword by Katrina Kenison (who made the preliminary selection) and the Introduction by Barbara Kingsolver (who didn't have to work so hard) giving reasons we should read short stories and berating us for not doing so.<BR>     One reason I read collections like this is the hope of coming across a writer I didn't previously know and must rush out and read read more of. A problem with this collection for this  particular purpose is that it contains work by well-known writers; one of the stories I liked best was by a writer whose every book is already on my shelves. The collections are also good for reading on flights with short hops (I bought this one at Logan Airport). For reading in bed or flying to California I need longer narratives.	2002-06-24

Many of the same situations recur. Even the bumbling fellow passenger on the plane is a rerun. The plot, as in all the others, hinges on which British spy will turn out to be a mole working for the Russians. Much of the action takes place in a divided Berlin. This was published in 1988 so the end of the Cold War was about to out-date it in a way, but it's still great entertainment.<BR>      One group of Deighton fans regards this series as a falling off from his earlier stories. They are more conventional in a way, but this partly refects that Deighton and Carre were being imitated, rather than that Deighton was yielding to fashion.	2002-06-17

Almost every one contains the words \\"dark\\" or \\"black.\\" Many of them are memories of agricultural operations that sound so primitive (ploughing with horses, churning by hand) that I was not sure if they were genuine. (But should that make a difference? What if we learned that Seamus Heaney was born and raised in Manhattan? ). They are written in the colloquial style of the British \\"Movement\\" Some of them contain subtle rhymes and rhythms but some, such at the relatively cheerful \\"Churning Day\\" could just as well, or even better, be printed as chunks of prose.

This is set in seventeenth century Holland, so I suppose I'm a bad person to review it because I start with a prejudice against historical novels. I think the novelist should stick to his or her own time. If I want to know how people spoke and thought in the seventeenth century I'll go to Samuel Pepys's Diary. One problem all historical novelists have is with dialog. Do you make people talk in modern colloquial way, which jars, or have them talk with yeahs and forsooths.  The usual compromise, which Chevalier adopts in this book, is having them talk in a stilted way with little humor or give and take. This conveys an atmosphere of solemnity. There was a lot of tragedy in the seventeenth century, but some people sometimes had good times. One of them was Leeuwenhoek, who appears as a solemn character in this book. He must have been bubbling over with excitement about Hooke's book on the Microscope when he talked to Vermeer. We know from his letters to the Royal Society how lively and interested in everything he was.<BR>     A ten year old child dies of plague in this book, and such terrible things happened then, but it was also possible for an amateur scientist, grinding his own lenses, to enter an unexplored world and start the train of discovery that would stop such things. Leeuwenhoek was the first man to see bacteria.	2002-06-06

After the first few pages I remembered that this was third in the Bernard Samson series, set in the 1970's and 80's, but it has close affinities to the Harry Palmer series of the 60's, especially Funeral in Berlin. (This has a 1985 publication date). If you're completely new to Len Deighton I'd start with those, and of course you should read Berlin Game and Mexico Set before this.<BR>   Some people think Deighton deteriorated in the later spy books. They contain fewer wisecracks and less descriptive scene- setting. In compensation there's a lot of subtle humor in the portrayal of the Dilbert-like atmosphere of office politics, and the plots are more sharply focussed and draw naturally to a climax. The earlier books tend to jump from episode to episode with a tidying up of plot in the last chapter.	2002-05-29

Previously Archilochus, in the Loeb library, was in the second volume of Greek Elegy and Iambus, which also contained  Anacreon, with a rhyming translation. and a puzzling commentary on the Parian chronicle. This is more logical. You get Archilochus, follwed by Semonides, Hipponax, Annanius, Susarion, Hermippus, Scythinus, Diphilus, Panarces and Adespota, which should be more than enough for anyone. This also has a lot more obscenity, which is sometimes fun.<BR>   The two missing stars refer to the content of the poets rather than the scholarship or translation. You have to (well don't really have to) wade through stuff about the brachycatalectic lame tetrameter, also called the episcazon trimeter (bet you didn't know that before) which has a spondee in the last foot, instead of an iambus.<BR>    Some of Gerber's translations seem to make more sense than Edmonds's did.  Where Edmonds had \\"In the spear is my kneaded bread\\" Gerber has \\"On board ship I kneaded barley bread\\" (still rather an unlikely activity). <BR>    I continue to be irritated about the way the Loeb Library deals with inscriptions.

Grafton is so good at building up atmosphere and setting scenes that her insistence on the cold and gloom in the mountains got to me and was even a shade depressing. I lit a fire in my library. It's not one of the funnier one in the series, although Mrs Newquist is a great comic creation (L is for Lawless is funniest). On the plus side it's one of the bettter plotted (B is for Burglar is best plotted). The solution has you flipping back pages and saying &quot;why didn't I think of that.&quot;  The suspense buildup is good.	2002-05-17

An impossible or supernatural event is treated naturalistically, or accepted deadpan without comment by the characters.(Isaac Asimov Magazine stories do this well).<BR>    Another trademark, reminiscent of the dirty Scottish shock-writers, is descriptions of drug and alcohol use from the point of view of the user. He also favors effects that used to be called Grand Guignol and are now called splatterpunk.<BR>     These devices are used as the hinges of his plots and the entertainment values of his stories often depends on how compelling you find them. Apart from them he is a witty and perceptive satirist with some wonderful prose such as his description of the small Suffolk town \\"landlocked by the shifting dunes of social trends\\" where  \\"the landlords of the three desultory pubs on the main street drew pints for themselves in the cool, brown, afternoon interiors of their establishments.\\"	2002-05-12

This could be described as a collection of short stories but that would be an injustice. It is a finely crafted novel with a page-turning plot. We follow the struggles of Lisa from a moderately poor and unhappy childhood on the moderately Anglicized East coast of Canada to a moderately prosperous and happy adulthood on the moderately Americanized West coast. It is true that each episode is self-contained and comes to its own climax but each adds another detail to the meticulously realistic picture. The narrative is told from multiple points of view, which is often a gimmick to show how clever the writer is, but which in Donoghue's hands never intrudes as a literary device. Each story centers on a member of Lisa's family, sometimes an immediate member, sometimes a niece or cousin.<BR>     It is utterly true to life, with the touches of humor that such truth brings. The tragedies are the mundane tragedies of everyday life; a promising brother becomes alcoholic; a heavy smoking mother dies.<BR>     I came across this book by accident, and never saw it reviewed in the New York Times book review or the Times Literary Supplement. It was a wonderful experience to open a first novel by an unknown author and find writing of this caliber. Bobby Ann Mason, Raymond Carver, Attwood and Monro were the writers  <BR>I was reminded of.

The boundaries are set for us. We struggle to cross them by migrating or by obtaining wealth or education or falling in love but the struggle exacts a cost.<BR>   To make this point he introduces interactions and confrontations between characters with almost every possible permutation of race and background (only the United States is left out). Characters are brahmins and untouchables, Panamanian born West Indians, white English shopgirls and white English aristocrats, white Portuguese and mixed-race Portuguese-African, black Africans and white Africans living in Africa, Goans and Germans.<BR>    Willy beds about one of each, and the plot is rather twisted to make this possible. He is born in India of a high caste father and a low caste mother and moves to England and Mozambique.<BR>    Naipaul makes it clear that the best place to live is a Western country where drinking water comes out of faucets, electricity always comes by flicking a switch, and the government is stable. If we get born in place like that we are lucky, but we didn't earn it so we should feel guilty about it, and if we try to escape the guilt we are foolish unrealistic liberals.	2002-04-09

He was all but forgotten, except for his role in Elizabeth Smart's \\"By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept\\" but the recent Fraser biography (\\"Chameleon Poet\\"} has raised interest.<BR>    Was he really all that good? <BR>    Well the first problem is that he wrote a lot of bad poetry. He had his own ideas about poetic scansion, which may have been valid, but which often give the casual reader the impression that this is rhyming poetry that does not scan, producing a McGonagall effect. Atrocious puns often add to an aura of amateurism.<BR>   Another defect is a strain of pretentiousness, often highlighted by howlers, malapropisms and inadvertent neologisms. We read of gladiola, \\"Hylas by a Babylonian spring,\\" \\"divers descending into Tuscaroras,\\" parthenogenical idols, cupidons, Obermann villages,and \\"dreams of Aphasia.\\"  \\"Arroya\\" is an example of the sort of thing we might pass over or blame on the proof-reader in prose, but which, especially when italicized, suggests a poet who is ignorant of Spanish but wants to use a foreign word for effect. Thus when we come to \\"quixotic quanta\\" and an alleged translation from Meleager we begin to suspect fake erudtion.<BR>     A hint of adolescent locker-room boasting of amatory triumphs mars the love poetry. Professed penitence seems to mask a desire to show that he is a desirable fellow who has had sex with many women.<BR>     He was often paired with Dylan Thomas, which may be unfair. They were contemporaries but Thomas made the good career move of dying young. They both had a way with adjectives, but whereas Barker piled on fancy long words like \\"multitudinous\\" Thomas used a subtle misplacement of common short words as in \\"not many then trod the rich and piling streets.\\"  They both wrote plays for radio around the same time. Barker's was about the spirits of Baudelaire and Gerald Manley Hospkins. Thomas's was about humble Welsh villagers. No need to ask which one survived. <BR>   There are a few gems, like the one quoted by Thwaite in the TLS review of the Fraser biography, but you have have to search hard in these 800 pages to find them.	2002-04-07

Reading this book gives an understanding of why American psychiatry continued for so long to be dominated by psychoanalysis and fought a long rearguard action against Kraepelin's classification of mental ilnesses and against organic treatments. The organic treatments available up to 1950 (with the exception of ECT) were pretty futile. When Thorazine and lithium came along from Europe the Americans thought they would be as useless as hydrotherapy and insulin coma. The psychoanalysts did at least seem to do something for people with mild depression and anxiety. The thought was that if only their methods were used intensively enough they could also help the schizophrenic and severely psychotic. <BR>     Maybe now the pendulum has swung too far. It's often difficult to get a severely ill patient hospitalized. Patients complain that their psychiatrists push pills instead of talking.<BR>     Beam is not entirely innocent of making fun of the antics of the mentally ill but he spreads his humor around and directs it mostly at less vulnerable targets, producing a work that entertains as well as enlightens.	2002-04-06

Milhone, who was born (as we know from L is for Lawless) in May, 1955 is now 35. Her cousin Tasha is strongly on the scene bringing more introspection about family bonds versus independence. Dietz is back - now 50 with a bad knee and regretting alienation from his sons. Jonah Robb is around and his wife is pregnant, though not by him. Kinsey has a problem sleeping and is not eating as much and gets transient hallucinations (maybe simple partial seizures - she should get an EEG. Prozac will be on the market by the end of the year)<BR>    She is hired to find the lost heir to a family fortune and falls in love with him. {He is a born-again Christian and only gets to brush her cheek with his lips).  He returns to the family mansion, in which live his three brothers, a sister-in-law and sundry servants (no butler) and gets murdered. So then you have a classic country house mystery in good old Agatha Christie style.<BR>    We learn a lot about the gravel and asphalt business and there are some wonerful bits of prose such as &quot; I could hear the clank of metal, the high whine of shifting gears as a wheel loader grumbled across flat ground as barren as a moonscape&quot; (but sometimes she gets a bit too fancy.

Kinsey gets involved with a family of criminals and finds herself half-wishing to be part of them.<BR>       It's interesting to note how Grafton solves the problem of the voice of the first person character. Sometimes Kinnsey Milhone uses a very conversational tone with colloquial phrases and words like \\"nifty\\" and \\"wow.\\"  At other times she seamlessly steps back into narrative mode with wonderful descriptions such as:<BR>  \\"The grass was still alive but all the deciduous trees had dropped their leaves.

At the beginning the brother is looking up his old high school girl friends, having sex with them, and telling his sister about it. He's still doing the same thing at the end. The mother is alcoholic and the sister is depressed. This is all the fault of the terrible father.<BR>      Beattie takes rather to much to heart the disclaimer at the front of the book that it is not intended to have any \\"resemblance to actual events,locales or persons.\\" <BR>     There's a certain vagueness about everything that I found irritating. Much is made of the fact that the father is a doctor (which makes him arrogant and a bad father and a bad husband) but we never understand what his specialty is. The mother's problems are laid to the oppression of women in the fifties, so time frame would be important, but we are never told what date the action is taking place in. The only work any character does that is described in detail is that of Nina, who is a copy editor. The characters (except for the nasty doctor) can spend very little time working because they're always travelling to meet lovers  drinking coffee or wine or eating out, or in pychotherapy. We are never told how much anything costs. <BR>     None of this would matter in a short story but by the end of 280 pages is gets tedious. Beattie should read Balzac or Sue Grafton.	2002-03-11

We had already had some of Le Carre, and James Bond and Our Man in Havana. I just re-read it after forty years and it still seems fresh and original. My copy has the price tag of 60 cents.<BR>   The plot is so ingenious that it's difficult to follow, and there's a long explanation at the end which still leaves a few loose ends if you want to pick nits. It goes fom London to the Lebanon, to a Pacific island and to Hungary (maybe) but the fact that it's first person narrative helps to keep the flow smooth. Later on I think Deighton grew repetitious, and even repeated some of his jokes.<BR>    Does anyone know Palmer's military rank? He gets addressed as Colonel at one point.	2002-03-03

An obituary writer notices an attempt to cover up the fact that a dead businessman was a famous rock star. The identity of the killer and the motive are revealed about half-way through. Then there's an attractive female kidnapped plot to build up suspense and then a second a.f.k.p. Another plot is one of Hiaasen's crusading ones. He's against the decline of good old-fashioned journalism and this involves the takeover of a worthy newspaper by a heartless chain.<BR>    A lot of expertise about rock music.<BR>    I like Hiaasen best when he keeps his feet on the ground and stays closer to reality. &quot;Striptease&quot; remains the best for me. My problem with this one, and several other recent Hiaasens has been the way the plot veers off into fantastic unbelievability. Too many unlikely things happen in too many plots. Aristotle said (I think) that fiction should deal either with either impossible probabilities or improbable possibilities.	2002-02-24

Any delays and discomforts you have to put up with will fade by comparison with what Stevens experienced. It's a hilarious account of travels in Central and West Africa. (incidentally at that time, the 1980's, Algeria was relatively safe).<BR>   Africans might have a legitimate gripe with the way they are portrayed but most comic travel books tend to portray the inhabitants of a country as childish or incompetent. Read Dickens's &quot;American Notes.&quot; I would have liked to hear the author's ideas on why things are as they are in Africa. Whose fault is it? What can be done? What will happen in future? This may be complaining that he has not written a different book but I see that he is, according to the jacket a &quot;political consultant&quot; so he must have some opinions.	2002-02-09

It begins with an unsparing description of a mother's grief over a murdered daughter and then Kinsey uncovers some apalling things about the dead girl's life and family. The clues to the killer's identity come abruptly at the end and the killer's motives are not completely convincing. The most compelling part of the book is the psychological study of Lorna's family. We learn a lot about water treatment plants.<BR>    Those who want an intriguing traditional puzzle plot with &quot;why-didn't-I-think-of-that&quot; clues planted early on should try B is for Burglar.	2002-02-06

Lonnie Kingman gives her a much-needed job investigating a six year old murder. The probable killer was acquitted and the victim's family want to bring a civil action against him. Henry's older brother William has arrived and is invloved with Rosie<BR>  This is one of Grafton's more classical mysteries. There's an ingenious collection of suspects.If you read chspter 11 very carefully and look at the times of the events on the night of the murder you might be able to figure out whodunnit. She gives us lore about mushroom poisoning (but Amanita phalloides is found in upland coniferous woods - not the kind of coastal California garden she describes).<BR>   One of the funniest passages is her paraphrase of a modern version of the 23rd psalm read at a liberal non-denominational funeral. Grafton is sometimes accused of being anti-Christian, but only someone with a profound respect for the King James Bible could have come up with this hilarious parody of a travesty. <BR>    The trademark final Kinsey Milhone in peril scene is one of her most convincing (assuming Santa Theresa police are slow about responding to gunfire) and suspenseful.	2002-02-05

None of the young people in this collection seem to be having a good time. The stories are set in contemporary or seventies America (one in London) Three are about teenagers. The young adults have unsuccessful artistic/acting careers and not-very-successful love affairs. The style is spare detached New Yorker. One of them &quot;Trouble People&quot; was in Seventeen. It's about a boy bucking peer pressure and befriending an unpopular unattractive girl. I liked the first one best, about a girl with a rather horrible father who dies. <BR>   I bought this a long time back on the strength of some rave reviews. It was borrowed by a daughter who recently returned it, telling me how good it was, and I re-read it and agreed with her.	2002-02-04

The con man is trying to re-establish a relationship with his family and Kinsey Milhone's long-lost family is trying to re-establish a relationship with her. Henry's bother William is also trying something.  The counterpoint and parallels are pointed out, and even to some extent I would have to say, the point is labored. As usual there are a multiplicity of other sub-plots.  <BR>    All of Grafton's penetrating humor and careful description of every sight and sound and smell and taste. Fans of the classic hardcore hardboiled classics, of Highsmith and of \\"Double Indemnity\\" might find it slow, and fans of Hannibal Lecter not bloody enough.	2002-01-30

It's the last one in the series to have a major CIC connection.<BR>    You have to re-read this after you've finished because a final three-word sentence stands the whole plot on its head. An even better reason for re-reading is to savor Grafton's English prose style. When she gets a whole building to describe she slightly prolongs things too much, but I love descriptions like this one, of a garage \\"The late afternoon sun slanted onto the cracked concrete floor in tawny yellow stripes. The air smelled of oil, old tires. and hot metal.\\"	2002-01-27

The present tense narrative voice reminded me of Elizabeth Smart's \\"By Grand Central Station I sat Down and Wept\\" but the prose is more spare and the illicit lover, her father is demonized rather than idealized.<BR>  But this is presented as fact and we find ourselves (or I do) wanting to make morality judgements as much as  literary ones. We want to decide where the fault lay, and ask such questions as: can we blame the victim? is there another side to the story? is this all true?<BR>  The incestuous father is slightly less blameworthy than some, since he met his daughter, virtually for the first time, when she was twenty; she was not financially dependent on him; she travelled long distances to visit him. There is no question of a fake memory (which I suspected in Cutter's \\"Memory Slips\\" also about an incestuous clergyman father). From her own self-description the author meets the criteria for what DSMIV calls \\"borderline personality disorder\\" which is a \\"blame-the-victim\\" pejorative sort of diagnosis although those afflicted with it suffer a great deal. <BR>     What was the connection between his religion and his crime? He sounds as if he gave himself a religious justification, like the Mormon polygamists, but he did not belong to a fringe evangelical groups with unorthodox sexual mores. He apparently later left the chiurch. <BR>    A lot of questions, a lot of food for thought, and a great book.	2002-01-27

One is a classical mystery with clues based on the Bronte sisters, about a woman's missing mother. The other is about a contract on Milhone's life taken by a jailed killer who hires a hit man. Actually, as always in Grafton, there are multiple plots: The hit man is trying to get custody of his son to prevent his mother raising him the wrong way and feeding him junk food;a woman goes into labor on the marriage registry office; Vera gets engaged after being caught in flagrate delicto etc, etc. A major strand is Milhone's affair with Dietz, her self-appointed bodyguard.<BR>     Hardcore Graftonologists will note that the telephone contact with Dietz in A is for Alibi is said to have taken place a year previously (hardcover publication date for that was 1982, this has a 1990 first publication date). Milhone has her thirty-third birthday is this one, and we are told that Irene is 47 and was born in 1940.	2002-01-20

I think you'd have to know Los Angeles and watch a lot of TV to fully appreciate it. Of course most of the world has more curiosity about how life is lived in Los Angeles than about Des Moines or Toronto, and more curiosity about the movie industry than widget manufacturing, so that gives it some degree of universal appeal. I did not catch all the cultural references. At times I felt like an American high school student trying to read Umberto Eco. One complete essay is about a television show called Baywatch, which is apparently popular in places like Uzbekistan and Thailand, so maybe I'll have to go there before I can appreciate it. Nevertheless, even for the ignorant, this is a very funny and insightful book.  <BR>      She complains somewhat about the fact that most people like her stories about her father best but I also found these were the best. I picked this book up after reading &quot;If You Lived Here You'd Be Home By Now&quot; which is a novel that picks up a lot of the same atmosphere and is easier for an unassimilated British immigrant living in the top right hand corner of the USA to understand.	2002-01-17

Housebound housewives have a specially high amount of depression. Men commit suicide more often and are more ptone to alcoholism. A number of theories have been suggested to account for these facts. <BR>    Jack reviews some of the psychological theories (none of the biological ones) and presents her own theory that the depression is the result of women's indoctrination to self-effacement and low self-esteem (This is an over-simplification, and you'd have to read the book to do her ideas full justice).<BR>     She supports her thesis by a two year study of twelve depressed women. She did not have a control group. I don't see why not. It could be that she wanted to concentrate on the individuals' feelings in a non-quantitative way, but she does present a questionnaire and some statistics.<BR>     Nevertheless the interviews and case studies are well done and helpful to anyone interested in depression. Her recommended psychotherapy methods (medication is barely mentions) seem to be what is sometimes called dialectical or cognitive. Again you'd need a control group to prove treatment effectiveness.<BR>     As a self-help book for depressed patients themselves. I think it's a little too densely written. The writing is good and lucid, but someone in the throes of a severe depression would find trouble following it. Relatives of depressed women, especially husbands, might benefit more but this is not one of the depression books I would highly recommend to non-professionals. Prodessionals who work with depression and students who are interested in cognitive and dialectical approaches with (ok - now it comes) a feminist slant should find it useful and highly readable.	2002-01-16

The information about that community was interesting. I don't know how accurate it was. They are apparently victims of severe discrimination. Kemal Kamankaya gets gratuitously insulted for his Turkish origin at all turns.<BR>   One problem is what the dust-jacket claims as a merit &quot;the influence of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett is impossible to miss.&quot;  You can say that again. It begins with the private eye waking with a hangover and breakfasting on coffee and beer. He then goes on to Sachertorte (which Philip Marlowe would not have done) and gets hired by a woman to investigate her husband's murders, which she thinks the police are ignoring because he was Turkish.<BR>     I had a problem with some of the dialog which must be due to the use of German slang. I'm not blaming the translator, Anselm Hollo. Colloquialisms are often just untranlatable, but translators should decide whether to tranlate into British or American demotic. People are addressed as &quot;sister&quot; &quot;duckie&quot; and &quot;dearie.&quot; I imagine &quot;God almighty, what a skinflint. What's lose for a paltry thirty marks&quot; was something more idiomatic in German.  Maybe some of the jokes are funnier in German or maybe they are well-known idioms. For example the character who &quot;snapped his jaws and squinted as if I had poured boiling water on his socks.&quot; which made me think of about the only line of German poetry I remember from school &quot;Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten.&quot;	2002-01-10

If you haven't read Bridget Jones's Diary yet you may be more impressed by the originality of this. Of course lack of originality doesn't detract from entertainment value. Maybe we should just accept that there is now a genre/category (sometimes called called chick-lit) within which some authors chose to write. The heroine, called Jane Goodall is pre-occupied with a man who rejects her (plot lifted from Virgil's about Aeneas and Dido) and plans revenge (plot lifted from Euripides about Medea and Jason) which she does by writing  (derived from evo-psychology) magazine articles about why men are unfaithful to their lovers. The quotations from animal behavior studies are among the best jokes. <BR>     It has some penetrating insights and funny satirical patches and it kept me interested and reading to the end.	2002-01-06

It's intriguing to read them consecutively and piece together the Milhone story - rather like reading Proust or Anthony Powell. All the alphabet stories are set within quite a short time-spand. The action in D is for Deadbeat begins in October of the year of C is for Corpse. E is for Evidence, in which her apartment is destroyed, takes place over Christmas of that year, and she moves to another coastal town in F is for Fugitive, while the apartment is fixed. E is for Evidence has a lot of her back story. Her second husband turns up in it. (Husband number one will turn up, sort of, in O is for Outlaw - I can't remember which is the one where she meets cousins). The California Fidelity connection is strong in E is for Evidence and the relationship with Henry Pitt intensifies poignantly at the end of F is for Fugitive.	2002-01-06

It helps to have read a few of the reviews first. Skipping to page 297 and reading the last part of the book first also makes it more understandable. Get some maps of South Wales and South-West England and then you're almost ready to read the book. You may notice that the the reviews have different versions of what it's about. I would say it's mainly about people trying to establish communes in Wales, and perhaps about the fate of utopian/religious communities in general and the relation between Wales and England. The main plot, told in the first person it about the author travelling from London to Hay-on Wye, on the Welsh border, which is itself a kind of commune, a town of used bookstores, to research the life of Walter Savage Landor. He has an affair with a woman called Prudence. He returns to london, and then learns that his father, a doctor in Wales, has died, and has to go back to Wales. On the way back he is falsely accused of having murdered Prudence and then incarcerated in a mental hospital. In the final chapters (which are more coherent) he is restored to sanity and there are reminiscnces of his boyhood in Wales.<BR>    The characters Dryfeld and Silverfish, the crooked bookdealers, who are travelling from London to Hay on Wye in the first chapters, later disappear from the book. The Kaporal plot is entirely separate and is mainly told in extracts from Kaporal's tapes (This part is also first person, so there are two separate first person narrators). These are partially explained after page 345 in &quot;Files Recovered from Kaporal's Caravan&quot;<BR>     It's full of literary allusions, especially to Anglo-Welsh writers who lived in the border area. It contains a lot of information about them but it helps if you already know who Kilvert, David Jones, Eric Gill, Father Ignatius, Henry Vaughan etc are. There are also many allusions to contemporary British writers and some of them appear under their own names, or thinly disguised, as characters.	2002-01-01

The adventures are too wild to be believable. I buy all Sparkle Hayter's and all Janet Evanovich's, but I have to admit that Evanovich is better. Hayter tries too hard to make every character eccentric, zany or wacky in every way but maybe that's the way Manhattan is.  The Trenton characters are more grounded in reality. I find that Robin Hudson comes more vividly to life whenever her background in Minnesota intrudes (which it doesn't in this book).<br />  Incidentally I noticed a reference to checking mail for anthrax (page 20 of the paperback) and this has a 2000 original publication date.	2001-12-27

Anacreon is translated very freely into jingly rhyming quatrains.<BR>    I was puzzled about the Parian Chronicle. This is quoted on pages 30-31 concerning the life of Dionysus the Younger. Then on page 315 we have a description of the &quot;Archilochus Monument&quot; apparently referring to the marble inscription in the museum at Parikia. It had been my understanding that this formed part of the Parian Chronicle, with the remainder taken by the perfidious English (the Earl of Arundel's chaplain) to the Bodleian.

Laing	Books	5	21	30	N	N	The Guru's Dilemma	This really should be read along with the biography by hy Ronald Laing's son, Adrian Laing.  Adrian Laing is much more critical. Although he is a lawyer and Burston a psychologist, I think Adrian Laing shows more understanding of RD Laing's place in psychiatry. Both books are very readable (which is the reason for the 5 stars) because Laing's life makes makes a good story. <BR>      By the end of the 1960's Laing was a dinosaur rather than an innovator. He was still blaming parents for their children's mental illness and advocating treating schizophrenia without medication. When I came to America in 1963 psychanalysis was dominant in psychiatry here. By the time time Laing died in 1989, psychanalysis was no longer taken seriously by most psychiatrists. I suspect that part of the reason for Laing's tragic self-destructive behavior came from the dawning realization that his treatment methods did not work for schizophrenia. Unlike Bateson and many of the American neo-Freudians, who were not MD's, he was a psychiatrist who undertook clinical responsibilities. Having set himself up, or been set up, as an omniscient healer he found he could not help those who turned to him.	2001-12-22

This biography of Elizabeth Smart explains what really happened.  <BR>    There is lot more to it than that. The insights into Canadian-British-American relationships are illuminating. The British literary scene comes  across as the least inhibited and most tolerant of the three. The book has those snide cutting anti-Canadian jibes that Canadian writers do so well. The account of Soho in the fifties is fascinating and the account of Edmonton in the seventies is devastating.   <BR>      Elizabeth Smart and George Barker and his wives went on to have close and warm relationships into their old age. In a way it's a happy ending to &quot;By Grand Central Station&quot; although there were further tragedies.

It places more emphasis on women's suffering and one senses glimmerings of feminism. It also has more humor. It makes more sense if you've read Rosemary Sullivan's &quot;By Heart&quot; (a biography of Smart) The title is a quotation from George Barker.	2001-12-18

It might be too purple and passionate for some. A lot of agonizing guilt over the fact that her lover was married (in fact the real life George Barker was married many times so she might have been in doubt which wife to have the agonizing guilt about). <BR>    The basic story is of her meeting the British poet George Barker in California (where he was trying to stay to sit out the Second World War) and travelling across America to New York with him. He gets into jail and hospital and eventually has to return to England.<BR>     It becomes more coherent if you read Rosemary Sullivan's &quot;By Heart&quot; which is a biography of Elizabeth Smart. It's interesting to read of her later friendly contacts with Barker and his last wife. There's also a biography of George Barker by Robert Fraser which I haven't seen yet.	2001-12-18

Re-reading it I realized I should have figured the murderer by page 200 but I didn't the first time.<BR>     The atmosphere is dark - several children's deaths- but this also has some her greatest humor. Daggett married &quot;but the warranty on his first wife hadn't expired.&quot;<BR>     The affair with Jonah is on again. Mike the likeable teenage drug dealer from B is for Burglat and Ron from the TipTop cab company have bit parts.

Then she goes off to the South of France with her family to write a book. Her children discover a pre-Roman Celtic treasure.  Her daughter gets abducted by a child molester.

The names keep proliferating in a bewildering way if you've never heard of these people and it gets repetitious after six hundred pages. It's witty and well written and full of drugs and sex.<BR>     Of course a memoir always gets judged by different criteria from other boooks. We pass judgement on the writer as a person. Autobiographers believe that we should forgive them for the sins they confess because they are confessing, but on the other hand they are always self-justifying to some extent and then again we always wonder if they're telling the truth. Assuming she's telling the truth I would only give Julia Plillips about a two or three on a wickedness scale of one to ten. (In fact there is a Depravity Scale that criminologists use and she would wouldn't register on it).  <BR>      At one level she is telling her story as a kind of Aesop's fable with a moral. The basic plot is &quot;see how I messed up.&quot; Pride goes before a fall, being rich and famous isn't everything, and don't get too happy and self-confident because something bad may happen. Kinehora (which I thought was spelt keine hora but she makes sound Hawaiian) means &quot;no celebration.&quot;  She puts a lot of emphasis on ethnic identity as a behavior explanation and maybe guilt is a Jewish thing, although plenty of Catholic and Protestant groups are good at instilling it. Essentially she's saying she should have felt more guilty sooner. Along with it though she is saying she was unfairly treated. <BR>     I found her account of cocaine addiction fascinating but I don't think I'd recommend the book to an addict. Although she sounds grateful to Dr Ron Siegel the bottom line seems to be that she gave it up herself cold turkey, without hospitalization, after a month in the Mayo Clinic had failed. At the end of the book she's still smoking cigarettes and dipping into a few other chemicals.	2001-12-10

He thinks someone is trying to kill him(....).<BR>   The publication date is 1986 and the action follows on that of B for Burglar (which may sound obvious but Grafton does not always have the plots in the series sequential and all are set in an eighties time-frame).<BR>    There's lot of Ross MacDonald in this. It's as much about families as about murder. The mother of Bobby the victim has been married twice before. Her latest husband, an idle foolish alcoholic, brings his daughter Kitty, an anorexic druggie, from a previous marriage. The Henry sub-plot is particularly strong in this (Henry is Kninsey Milhone's octogenarian landlord). I understand the abridgements of these novels leave Henry out. In a way it's a distraction but it neatly counterpoints the other family, as also does the family of Rick Bergen the boy killed in Bobby's first crash. A problem with Ross MacDonald was the way the book consisted of interview after interview and Grafton avoids that by breaking it up with the Henry plot.<BR>     I was a little surprised by the amount of socialization with a family by their doctors; not only their children's psychiatrist, but the forensic pathologist who autopsies family members. Maybe they do these things in California. Grafton is always accurate in her medical expertise. (The symptoms of traumatic brain damage are well-described here).<BR>     What is it that makes Grafton so great? I don't think it's primarily Milhone's character, memorable though that is. Her trademark is careful scene-setting. Her action moves quite slowly but we don't notice that because what holds it up is  meticulous description of every place that Milhone is in and every character she meets. Detail is piled upon detail to create an exact picture that we can almost touch and feel. There are great writers who manage without this (who knows what an EM Forster character looks like) and there are poor writers who  bore us with longwinded descriptions. Grafton is on her own.	2001-12-02

Savannah is hired by a client to find his long-lost sister. She begins to help then finds that the sister is being stalked by an abusive murderous ex-husband and that he may be the supposed &quot;brother.&quot; The woman is murdered and everything points to the ex-husband, whom Savannah may have helped, but then he is murdered in the same way.<BR>    Later on the plot crumbles and the mystery is resolved by introducing confessions and new witnesses (although I suppose that is what mostly happens when real murders are solved).<BR>     Savannah is a great character with a complex and ambiguous set of relationships. She is unmarried, past 40 and overweight. She is estranged from her mother and father and had to raise her siblings with the help of her grandmother. Her closest male friends are Dirk, whom she finds sexually repugnant and a gay male couple whom she finds sexually attractive. She is closely involved with her pretty female assistant.<BR>      There are patches of inspirational sickly sloppy sentimental stuff but they can be skipped or you might even like them. This is second in the series. Rather darker and better plotted (which is not saying much because McKevett is not a great plotter, at least as far as the main mystery is concerned) than the others.	2001-11-29

Robert Owen is probably best known as an utopian socialist with worthy but fuzzy ideas. He has always stood out from other early socialists because, as GDH Cole (I think) said he was able to beat the capitalists at their own game when he put his mind to it by running successful businesses. This book shows how one of seven children of a Welsh saddler could rise in the world of the early steam engines and factories. I was fascinated by his life in his twenties in Manchester, where he was friendly with Dalton (the originator of the atom) and lent money to Fulton (the inventor of the steamship) and discussed religion with Coleridge. The later life is already well known. The narrative livens up again describing travelling west in the United States. I should have liked more explanation of how he acquired his technical skills after what sounds like an apprenticeship only in retail trade. Some of the financial transactions remain obscure. The author pursues a Robinson Crusoe metaphor at puzzling length. I thought he used too many lengthy quotations from dully written sources (including Owen's own flat and boring autobiography). I should like to have known more of what finally became of New Lanark, Ormiston and New Harmony (where Donnachie apparently met Owen family descendants) and about the birth control ideas and accusations of sexual immorality. Nice illustrations. On the whole this is more a scholarly biography than one that can be read through for entertainment.	2001-11-26

They are unlikely to stimulate interest. The plot of each book is related in very simple language. There are banal test questions demanding brief factual answers. Sometimes these are inaccurate or assume that a partcular translation is being read. For example in book IV the attitude of Andromeda's parents &quot;struck Perseus as pretty futile&quot; which seems to be an attempt at &quot;nec ferunt auxilium secum sed fletus digno tempore.&quot;  Then at the end the student is asked to comment on the &quot;casual colloquial speech.&quot;  I think that only a very advanced classicist can tell whether a piece of Latin is casual and colloquial and this is not a book meant for advanced classicists. The introduction thinks it worth telling us that this is Ovid's only poem written in dactylic hexameters (which might be of interest to a VERY advanced classicist) but then does not explain what a dactyl is. <BR>    There is almost no reference to contemporary scholarship about what Romans of Ovid's day thought about the truth of these stories, or about such issues as human sacrifice. Robert Graves and Edith Hamilton are given as authorities.<BR>     The illustrations are as wooden as the text, badly drawn and totally unerotic (maybe meant for Catholic schools, or am I being prejudiced?) which seems a particular shame since so many of these stories have inspired unforgettable and sexy illustrations by the greatest artists of all time. I wonder what Max Notes would have made of the Ars Amatoria.	2001-11-21

Summarizing the plot premise makes it sound like just another private eye serial killer thriller. A string of gruesome murders by a killer who taunts his victims with threats. The murders are somehow linked to events of twenty years previously and to the family of Patrick Kenzie, the detective. Very strong subplots about Kenzie's affair with Angie ( his partner, ex-wife's sister and ex-wife of his ex-best friend) and about his relationships with Boston policemen and firemen. In spite of the cliche elements and echoes of Thomas Harris (mutilation, a cunning sociopathic prisoner) it is set apart by the high literary quality of the writing.  <BR>     As in &quot;A Drink Before Dying&quot; the downside is the dark and gloomy atmosphere. There is some bitter humor and sharp satirical social observation but the overall effect is depressing (I suppose you could say the same about Hamlet).<BR>     On the credibility/ plausibility side, I keep wondering why Kenzie stays in Dorchester if he finds it such a terrible place. Phil half explains why Angie never leaves but Kenzie is a single 35 year old making $48000 a year and never seems to enjoy much of Boston.	2001-11-17

Two of the contestants are murdered. Savannah's empty-headed sister turns up with anorexia nervosa. As usual in this series the sub-plot is better than the main plot, although this one is better than her previous ones as a murder mystery. She moves the story along with clunky prose like &quot;the plan she had crafted so carefully was beginning to unfold.&quot;  Some of the dialog is good but then you get stuff like<BR>    &quot;'Ah Savannah, me darlin' he called out in his delightful Irish brogue ' tis a sight for there sore eyes ye are, love'&quot;<BR>   By now some of the jokes are getting repetitious, such as Dirk's stinginess and Dr Liu's PMS chocolate craving, but I don't suppose that matters if you are new to the series.<BR>     All is forgiven, however, for the sake of the fully drawn and well-characterized heroine with her cats, her siblings, her grandmother, her attitude problem, her ambivalence towards men, and above all, her food.	2001-11-11

Great scenery and nature writing - very little humor (except for some banter with her Manhattan-dwelling sister). No more violence than is necessary to carry the story (but graphic descriptions of what wild creatures do to dead bodies in the wilderness). The best suspense scene involves Pigeon alone in a fall down a mountain slope to the edge of a precipice. Mild sex (M-F and F-F). There is political agenda ( females and tree-huggers are good guys, ranchers and hunters are bad guys, Christians are silly) but I didn't find it too intrusive.  The final showdown action scene with the murderer was unconvincing, but these scenes almost  always are.	2001-11-08

This is his first. A crooked hypocritical Massachussets politician hires Patrick Kenzie to look for a cleaning woman who has disappeared. Kenzie is an idealistic but cynical child abuse survivor, divorced, crossed in love,hard-drinking, and torn between his liberal convictions and the harsh realities of crime. Boston is vividly described.<br />  It is a page-turner but is not light entertainment and is somewhat depressing.I'd recommend it for a long flight rather than beach or bed reading. The humor is sardonic and bitter, and there are seriously treated themes of racism,and corruption. Many violent and horrible deaths are graphically described. Children are tortured and sodomized. Policemen are emotionally burnt-out and alcoholic.	2001-10-29

They have a problem with the toaster. The problem must have got to the husband because the next thing we read is that he has committed suicide. Trying to fix appliances can be pretty frustrating. Then the wife (his third - he went back to the first wife to kill himself) goes back to the house they were renting and practices being a body artist. This involves an act where she stands on stage carrying a brief case and checking the time on her watch. (Some people think this is slow and repetitious and walk out, the world being full of stupid philistines who cannot appreciate significant art). Anyway she goes back to the house to practice and finds a creature living in the attic. It's a small man and she may be imagining him. He takes a walk to pick up some scouring powder (Ajax - very symbolic) and disappears.<BR>    That's about it. After reading it you can say you've read some Don DeLillo (one is supposed to have read Don DeLillo if one is not to be considered semi-literate) and you don't have to wade through his long novels.	2001-10-28

The hero trying to work a scam for a magazine story gets involved in solving a murder, saving a wilderness from ruthless developers, being stalked by hit men, discovering an archeological site, discovering an extinct bird, unmasking a fake evangelist etc etc. It's all too much. The first hundred pages are told from multiple points of view and are crammed with farcical adventures that have nothing to do with the main plot. At the drop of a hat people start telling each other ancient Hawaiian legends and explaining ornithology, linguistics and geology (quite interesting and well explained).  They are also liable to tell themselves things too. For example &quot;&quot;Two years&quot; he mumbled &quot;I've schemed and planned...&quot;&quot;  and then the bad guy goes on mumbling (presumably out loud) for a complete paragraph. <BR>     Parts of it were very funny; parts of it were very informative; parts of it were exciting and dramatic. Some of the scenery descriptions were wonderful. Maybe I shouldn't grumble. The author is over generous and has crammed the contents of two or three books into one. Anybody planning a trip to Hawaii should enjoy it.	2001-10-21

The scene is Farberville and Claire Molloy the bookstore owner is the detective. Nobel Prize prose it's not. It's written in an almost old-fashioned style with lots of cliches and weak jokes (as you can see from sample pages on this WEB site) but I think this is deliberate attempt to create the cosy atmosphere (If it really is deliberate then I should have given an extra star). No sex or violence. It's light bland entertainment and the victims' deaths are no tragedy.  Clues are placed that should enable you to figure whodunnit. The plot is clever enough and the suspects likely enough to keep you turning the pages. Not quite up to Agatha Christie, but in that style. The only ethnic diversity is that Molloy's policeman boy friend is called Rosen and comes from New York. Some curious anachronisms. There are references to jitterbugging and back street abortions but also to the high school class of 1990 and to the 60's &quot;fifteen years ago&quot; (Roe v Wade was 1973). Suspend critical judgement and relax and enjoy.	2001-10-17

It starts of with a tough, cynical, honest,hard-drinking, wise-cracking Los Angeles PI taking on a female client. At first it seems as if it's going to be a parody of that genre. A problem with this is that there are so many humorous take-offs on Philip Marlowe et al already. The other problem I had is that sometimes the book suddenly switches gears to take itself seriously. For example in one scene the hero (an alcoholic 35 year old whose workouts consist of tai-chi) enters the lair of a bad guy and single-handedly floors two bodyguards. Are we supposed to be laughing or not?  Ian Fleming could make his hero ridiculously superhuman but we knew exactly how far he had his tongue in his cheek (Fleming I mean). The plot centers on a kilo of cocaine that the client's disappeared husband may or not have stolen. A kidnapped child provides a suspense ingredient. I agree with the reviewer who said that the behavior of the distraught mother is unlikely.<BR>     This lacks that spark of originality that makes humorous crime writing like Elmore Leonard's or Janet Evanovich's great. All the same it's excellent entertainment for those who like their crime laced with laughs, including myself. I'm ordering the rest of the series.	2001-10-04

It's set in an Ireland that reminded me of John Le Carre's cold war Germany. The IRA and the British are involved and there are intricate double double-crosses. The bad guys lose but the good guys don't quite win and are not all good. I had to read it twice to get the plot straight but it was well worth it. Not much humor . Perhaps not the book to read if you're trying not think about September 11, although again that makes it all the more relevant.	2001-10-01

The great attraction is the character of Savannah Reid who is forty plus and gets fired from the local police force for being overweight and sets up as a private eye. She is overtly heterosexual. Many varieties of sex are hinted at but the main carnal pleasure described is food, and there is some excellent food description. <BR>    On the negative side: The murder mystery gets solved by a new character being introduced who tells Savannah who did it. A few sentences like &quot;Savannah had only one cognitive thought after she hit the floor&quot; and an unlikely confession by the murderer.	2001-09-27

I haven't quite figured out the sex angle. She shares a bedroom with a gorgeous young female assistant and has three close male friends, two of whom are gay and one of whom she finds physically unattractive. I came to it after &quot;Cooked Goose&quot; which is more of a thriller. This is more of a classical whodunnit although no real clues to the killer are planted, and after I had finished I decided the murder method made no sense. It has the British cosy set-up of a closed community (a health spa) containing the detective and the likely suspects, but I don't think Miss Marples would have told the frog joke.	2001-09-26

Apparently the term &quot;hidden cirriculum&quot; was introduced in 1968 by Philip Jackson. It has long been known that schools for children did more than teach reading, writing and arithmetic, but this used to be considered a good thing - building up character or teaching citizenship or whatever. Those who seek higher education might be expected to be better prepared to resist brainwashing but the book shows that they too can  be indoctrinated in subtle ways. <BR>     The title led me to fear unintelligible prose of the kind I associate with words like &quot;deconstruction&quot; anf &quot;post-modernist&quot; and &quot;structuralism&quot; but it is quite well written and understandable. I suppose it would be asking for a different book to complain that there are no opposing views presented. Some conservatives believe that our campuses are hotbeds of radicalism and feminism and vegetarianism etc. Their views would have livened it up a bit. As it is the contributors battle an invisible opponent, but perhaps that fits in with the concept of the cirriculum being hidden.	2001-09-26

The first part is the most interesting. It looks at why so many of us feel we could write a a book &quot;if I had time&quot; but never get around to it. His explanation is that the motive is one of revenge and the inhibition arises from the fear of  confessional exposure and of self-revelation. This is not a completely original theory but he explores its implications thoroughly andpresents it well. <BR>    He insists that the most valuable writing uses no long words,draws from the writer's autobiography, and lets it all hang out. I must admit that I often enjoy detached ironic works in a pompous mandarin style such as the novels of Sarah Caudwell or Ivy Compton-Burnett, or Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.	2001-09-26

Later on the abused children look after their dying father, a WWII veteran with a PhD, and seek his love. These terrible childhoods always make good stories when told by their survivors. The worse the childhood the better the story because we know that the writer survived to become a person who could write a book. It's always a question as to how much is true (I've heard that Frank McCourt's mother was a New York secretary) but this one could stand on its own as fiction. We're given a lot of jacket biography, and even a cover designed by the author, that form an intrinsic part of the story. I share the other reviewers' irritation with the apostrophes on the gerunds but I guess them white trash aint gonna mind that none.	2001-09-23

Poverty-stricken retired journalist Truman Kicklighter and nineteen year old waitress Jackleen are great characters, and so are some of the others (although a few stereotypes).My problem was with the plot. The central idea of a computer program so certain to produce wins at the dog races that three murders are committed for it was implausible. I was not even sure if this was the central plot. An Alzheimer victim is falsely accused of murder. Kicklighter is afraid of being evicted from his SRO hotel. His daughter is dating a cop. His grandson is kidnapped. A fake evangelist is swindling elderly victims. All these sub-plots are stitched together by coincidences and the action is punctuated by gunplay.	2001-09-22

It reminds of the Sherlock Holmes type of plot, such as &quot;The Redheaded League&quot; that begins with a mystifying situation rather than a murder. The puzzle is to explain it. The mystery deepens and deepens and then the solution explodes and you go back and look at the clues and say &quot;Why didn't I think of that?&quot;	2001-09-21

A good, and even useful, description of a family coping with grief. The wife and parents and child (and dog) of the victim come together in moving way to cope with bereavement, and are helped by a minister (although it's quite high on sex and violence). I think the reviewer who complained of exposition has a point. She tends to tell us what to think of a character before showing us. For example Joanna Brady's parents are introduced as &quot;rock-solid, salt-of the earth type people&quot; Not as much humor as I personally like, although a certain amount in the portrait of Joanna's non-supportive mother. No great dialog. No great prose. She gets along with telling the story.	2001-09-21

My main main objection is the  attempt to explain Dollarby's crimes in terms of his unhappy childhood.  Amongst the victims of the most vicious criminals are their innocent parents who, in most cases (such as McVeigh and Gancy) have done their best for their children and are stigmatized by this kind of spurious pop psychology, derived from old Hollywood movie versions of psychoanalysis. It is possible for parents to screw up their children but they are seldom to blame for their children's crimes.  <BR>     As a psychiatrist, I may be a little prejudiced against Thomas Harris. Very few of my colleagues are like Dr Lecter.	2001-09-20

They become involved in series of ventures that fail and trends that prove disappointing. Attempts to complete a PhD, get a tenured academic post, write a novel, sell a screen play, make money in real estate, and start a computer software company each end in failure. Each new fashion becomes outmoded. <BR>    They are contrasted with Paul's parents who live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and winter in Florida in steady unglamorous prosperity.  The parents work and save, celebrate a fiftieth wedding anniversary, and go to church on Sundays.<BR>     The satire is sharp but not savage, and most of the characters are nice people. The book culminates in the liberal ambivalence produced by the Watts riots and drifts to an inconclusive ending. I'm glad she resisted the temptation to a dramatic tragic ending but would have liked to have known more of what became of Paul and Bronwyn.	2001-09-16

Good sub-plot about her family back in Georgia and good minor characters. No animals but two animalistic five-year olds. The main plot, about a serial rapist cop-killer, rather creaks. It's more of a thriller than a mystery because the killer's identity is made obvious early on. A hilarious opening scene. <BR>     It's probably unfair to compare this with Sue Grafton just because it's a female private eye set in a California beach resort town - you can't copyright the West Coast and anyway Chandler got there first - but comparisons keep coming to mind and Grafton is a superioir litarary product. McKevett does not have Grafton's (sometime over-prolix) gift for scene-setting. Her tone is not as ironic and she gets preachy and sentimental. Grafton is all first person whereas this is told from Savannah's POV but sometimes switches to the murderer's or victim's point-of-view. Recipes for cornbread that involves melted bacon fat and for a stuffing (apparently called dressing in Georgia) that assumes you've made the cornbread and uses that as an ingredient, and then uses 6 ounces of butter.

The plot concerns the efforts of Sir Austin Feverel to prevent his son's marriage and then to break it up. There are ponderous attemps at humor. A tragic and melodramatic ending is tacked on. The story is often difficult to follow, with characters being assigned different names. Jane Austen had already shown how a a tight light novel could be constructed. Madame Bovary had been written (for the diffference between mediocrity and genius compare the descriptions of the food at the wedding breakasts in this and in Madame Bovary). This has the clumsy baggy long-winded structure of Dickens (who was writing Great Expectations at the sme time) but without the great characters and confrontations. This was popular literature in its time, and considered scandalous.	2001-09-04

In first place it's written in the voice of a violent drifter &quot;grown down in Arkansas&quot; with apostrophes instead of g's at the ends of words. This dialect stuff works for me when describing a raft trip down the Missisipi and I think Portis succeeded with a similar narrative voice in &quot;True Grit&quot; but Twain and Portis stuck to describing action and Woodrell makes his narrator describe sunsets and reflect on the nature of society.<BR>   I had a second problem in the middle of the book with the murder mystery element which hinges on the fact that the venial town cop refuses to investigate the killing and the victim's family have to investigate themselves and burglarize the office of the corrupt incompetent coroner. Some of this might have been plausible in the fifties but many elements in the story set it in the eighties or nineties (Bev, the mother of 19 year old Jamalee is child of the 60's). <BR>   &quot;The Ones You Do&quot; remains my favorite Woodrell. I thought &quot;By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept&quot; was set during, not after, the Second World War.	2001-08-31

One problem with all these satires on the Hollywood scene is that the world described is so unfamiliar that we don't know what is being satirized and when the description is realistic. It's like Stella Fitzgibbon's &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; or Lewis Caroll's verse parodies where we find the pastiche funny but don't know the originals.     It's the story of the making of a movie flop told in the first person by the various characters (agent, actress, producer, writer, d-girl) involved. It is written in Californian with many obscure dialect words. Part of the merriment of the jest lies in the author's use of this patois. It includes an admixture of Spanglish and dropping the first syllables of words. I often suspected he introduced his own neologisms for comic effect.      Above all it's very entertaining and very very funny.	2001-08-23

She throws in a mystery based on a Halloween treasure hunt and the whole thing becomes too complex. She strives hard to make her characters zany and eccentric and the plot takes arbitrary twists and turns as she and her friends follow the treasure hunt clues. The descriptions of bizarre costumes are a running gag which becomes repetitious.

You have to have read Madame Bovary (or maybe Cliff's notes on Madame Bovary) to understand the plot. You don't have to have read &quot;Un Coeur Simple&quot; but you probably will after reading this. It's not until three-quarters of the way through that you suddenly realize there's a plot. Until then it's a series of very clever biographical essays about Flaubert. Then you understand why the narrator it obsessed with Flaubert. Then you get equally clever essays about the nature of love and grief. Wonderful insight into the poignancy of bereavement combined with sharp and erudite wit. It may be too erudite and clever for some. It demands a certain amount of francophilia and anglophilia, and understanding phrases like &quot;I might let the TLS have it.&quot; I'd always thought it was Nabokov, not Starkie who accused Flaubert of getting mixed up about the color of Emma's eyes. I think he did get get mixed up about the color of Loulou's wings in Un Coeur Simple- at least in the English translation I read.	2001-08-06

Of course we'd had Miss Marples and Nancy Drew, but they were part-timers. I think PD James's &quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman&quot; was earlier and Paretsky's &quot;Indemnity Only&quot; came later. This was published in 1982. I just went back to it after &quot;P is for Peril&quot; and the writing is undated (I noticed the exact same simile about the sea looking like a ribbon stiched to the sky, the penchant for describing every building in detail, and the lack of detail about guns). In fact I think all the novels take place within the same five year time frame. They were putting accounts onto computers but still used typewriters. These days she'd have carried a cell phone instead of a &quot;small automatic&quot; which would have spoiled the final climactic suspense action scene.	2001-07-30

Digges rejected residential placement and medication is not mentioned. The therapist she found most helpful was Eduardo Bustamente, the author of &quot;Treating the Disruptive Adolescent&quot;. The treatment regime, as she describes it, was that of abandonment of any attempt at limit-setting, combined with taking in a number of pet animals. The results seem satisfactory so far, judging by this account, I think that what Bustamente helped most with was the mother's feeling of guilt. Many of of these parents feel they must take the blame for their children's misbehavior. The book will be useful to parents who suffer this kind of worry about what their friends and family and neighbors think. Digges was helped by knowing she had raised an exemplary older son. She also seems to like animals herself.       The writing is beautful and poetic, and even contains poetry. as well as diary entries, letters to schools, and extracts from Jane Goodall's observations of apes. In fact it is rather too literary to be a self-help book I would recommend to most parents. It is not written at a practical advice-giving level.	2001-07-23

This can certainly happen but needs more comment than the author gives it. The only reasons for their despair are that they don't like their jobs (one of them loses his job but finds temporary work) and would like more money and are frustrated writers. I wanted to understand more. They party and drink and plan a not-very-major crime (stealing some office furniture). There are some good confrontations (with the professional criminals they ask to help) and funny episodes. (For example: They realize that the truck they are going to use has a standard shift and none of them knows how to use it. They have ask a girl-friend to give them emergency driving instruction). The whole thing read like an amusing half hour television sitcom. Good entertainment but not much more than that. I felt there was more important novel in there trying to get out.	2001-07-20

I do (like) and did (enjoy). It's set in Manhattan with the narrator working in TV. She's something of a Bridget Jones character. Maybe there's symbolism in the S and M stuff, with the heroine having problems at work about being assertive or passive in a male-dominated world but mostly it's just funny with an ingenious and suspensful plot.

They contain violence and, in a way, sex, although sex is never explicitly described. They almost always end in disaster, sometimes grotesque and cruel disaster. The sexual element is never quite straight heterosexual attraction between consenting adults. A frequent plot is that someone is invited somewhere by a host who becomes hostile or takes a journey following an unreliable guide that ends badly.  Think DH Lawrence, Joyce Carol Oates, Roald Dahl, Truman Capote and, as regards the prose style. maybe even Raymond Carver  He is a minimalist with a way of bringing an exotic setting to life in half a sentence without an adjective or adverb.

Excellent but digressive descriptions of birdhunting and some amusing outrageously behaving addicts and criminals. Good fight scenes and some funny lines The setting is apparently a Western Canadian city and I was not sure about the time frame.

These wonderful stories have been chosen to represent, according to the foreword, the clash between the indigenous culture and the third world. Perhaps black English speakers are not considered indigenous enough and there is nothing from Belize or about the Garifuana. Only one story is from Panama. It would be interesting to know if the right wing is literate at all.      I get two problems with politically motivated fiction. The first is that fiction may be one-sided and over-simplify a complex situation. The second is that when terrible atrocities have been committed then writing about them in fiction can make us complacent. We are able to say &quot;it is only a story&quot;(does Arturo Armas really remember the events of 1954).      That said, these are are all remarkable. The influence of the South American magic realists can be seen, especially in the title story and there is a tendency to idealize Indian life and the Popol Vul.

I didn't come away with my view of life changed so that I encounter a person or situation I say &quot;that reminds me of Mary Flanagan.&quot; There are some short story writers (such as Trevor and Updike) who are so darned good at what they do that they need no gimmick.

It is framed around the biography of the writer's friend Le and the idealized biography of a girl (SueAnn Big Crow) whom he never met. This framing is loose.  He also recounts several visits to the reservation and digresses (very interestingly) into the history of Native Americans. He is very frank about the alcohol and other problems and does not flatter his subjects (except perhaps the deceased girl).      Authors with academic credentials whom I have read differ about some of the ethnographic and historical data he presents. Obviously much of the politics is controversial.      He has a marvellous gift for describing the nondescript. He can take a straight road running across the prairie, or a piece of barren flat land with some junk and rocks, or an alleyway behind an urban commercial building, and bring it vividly to life in a few sentences.	2001-06-10

Compared to other Maggody books this has more emphasis on what a depressing life Arly leads and what a miserable place Magoddy is. Clues are not planted early on, but  the solution is logical because the murderer is acting in character.  I was reminded of the way PD James gets to her solutions.

He has now been overtaken by other writers for the impecunious and his epigones do not have his wit and originality - they write in humorlesss cliches. It's worth buying all the books you can because even budget travel to Europe is a major expense. I think he devotes to much space to restaurant reviews in places where there are rows of restaurants with their prices and menus on display. Hotel reviews are more useful.       Budget travel books have to be bang up-to-date and this one has a 1998 publication date.  A 2001 edition for the Islands is promised. No illustrations except maps.	2001-05-27

All those clever literary devices got in the way of the story (or stories) but it is enjoyable and well written. You'll probably find your own favorite character or couple. I loved Oscar's father - more believable than Oacar. The climactic rapprochement between Chloe and Harry and Esther was gooey and sentimental but heartwarmingly effective - I was reminded of the death of Little Nell and what Oscar Wilde said about it.	2001-05-27

At first they seem random but as you keep reading (and it does keep you reading) you realize that it is telling a story, the story of the transition of Greece from the nineteenth century to the twenty-first. The changes that become apparent in the decade covered are slight. At the end Greece remains a land of tyrannical petty bureaucracy, arrogant autocrats, poverty, and male chauvinism. The only definite hisorical change is a retrogressive one - the takeover by the Colonels. Yet you see the slow but unstoppable tide of progress - of people leaving Greece and ideas coming back to Greece, of women breaking free of oppression, and young people seeking education. Perhaps you could say it ridicules Greece (it's often funny) but in the end it's a tribute to what Greeks have accomplished in the face of all odds, by courage and intelligence and hard work.	2001-05-23

The questions that arise would not be important if the book were less important. A problem I've recently had with several first person narratives of traumatic childhoods (McCourt and Azzopardi for instance) is whether they are supposed to be fiction. This is described as a novel but the grandmother is given the name of the author's grandmother, and the writer steps in as omniscient narrator to discuss the sociology of the Rhondda Valley in a way that would only be justified if she were describing facts rather than fiction.  She attributes the present decline to unemployment and yet previous years of unemployment and poverty gave rise to the culture described by Gwyn Thomas, and in Parnell's memoirs, and in Meic Stephens' anthology. The window of prosperity was brief.       Were the valleys ever really full of chapel-goers, Welsh-speakers, poets, Marxists, singers, and auto-didacts?	2001-05-20

I believe this was written a long time before Cat Chaser which covers the same political ground  (but in the Dominican Republic, not Nicaragua). Good New Orleans atmosphere.	2001-05-05

The PD James gimmick is to probe her characters in depth. You get told about their childhoods (always miserable) and their parents, and in many cases grandparents, and in some cases their greatgrandparents. A lot of London atmosphere and rather too much about architecture.  I always have a problem with her dialog. Characters speak in long complete sentences, which is about believable when they are college graduates, but gets to sound odd for demotic speech. An uneducated young criminal speaks about throwing a knife &quot;under a privet hedge&quot; and goes to a &quot;derelict cottage&quot; separated from thr &quot;North Sea&quot; by a &quot;shingle bank.&quot;       Dalgliesh is a plaster saint. He has no orifices.       A thing I've done with some PD James, which will horrify purists, but adds to the enjoyment for me, is to peek at the ending when I/m halfway through. Even if this does spoil it for you there are plenty more PD JAmes's. This is the 14th in the Dalgliesh series alone.	2001-05-05

The plot starts off on an unlikely foot with a lawyer confessing to a murder he did not commit and framing himself to protect his daughter, then an even more implausible false confession by the daughter (brainwashed into false memory under the influence of drugs). I'm not giving anything away because these happen early on, so credulity is strained from the start.      On the other hand some good descriptions of bad food, especially execrable coffee, and of Philadelphia. Very little humor, except some satirical digs at law firms and Catholic schools.     I only pick up books like this at airports.  Looking at the Amazon.com listing it's not even a real best-seller now, although I think I've seen Scottoline in the New York Times listing.	2001-04-04

The author can stand back and say &quot;these are fictional characters and whether they are good people or bad people is of no concern.&quot;    This book, however, is very much a novel of ideas. The conflict is between the earthy hedonism of Zorba and the metaphysical philosophizing of the narrator. Zorba converts him to his way of thinking.  We are invited to admire Zorba.     Yet Zorba's actions have included killing and torturing men who have a different religion (&quot;Turks&quot; although Cretan Moslems were indigenous Greek speakers). He now says he is ashamed but does that make him admirable? He has apparently deserted his family (although towards the end of the book he is described as a widower and remarries).	2001-03-30

His attempts to gain some freedom and dignity in life (especially to be owner of a house) are constantly thwarted. He is trapped into marriage, becomes subservient to his wife's awful family and loaded with debt. Is he held back by poverty, or by the chains of Hindu tradition, or by the colonial system, or racial prejudice, or is his problem his own personality? Are  these separate problems or one problem?  One reviewer questions whether a book about such a frustrated life can be called funny. I think that it's one of those books with such a broad and rich view of life that humor inevitably finds its way in.	2001-03-25

It seemed strange that the only anti-depressant medications mentioned are ones being used illicitly by the kids in the local school. I'm not saying that they would have worked, but usually after several suicide attempts the question of Prozac arises. When someone says &quot;I  don't feel good&quot; but &quot;Nursie says I'm not sick&quot; then clinical depression might be a possibility.  It is so compulsively readable that I finished it rapidly so perhaps I missed something. It is mentioned that Augusta is fearful of being treated with drugs at Forest Ridge.	2001-03-23

In fact the details about the boats and timetables may be too much. If you're moving from island to island independently you have to have it. It's the only one that tells you about the boats themselves.       Reading this book could even save your life My favorite comment in the 1999 edition was about the boat then called the Golden Vergina. &quot;a large grime bucket-she has inthe past shuddered along, not thanks to an excess of engine  vibration but rather with the collective disgust of her passengers. thanks to the conditions on board ... better than no boat all but only just.&quot;  She was renamed  the Express Santina and if you read about the Paros shipwreck you know the rest. 80 were drowned.	2001-03-13

The incidents forming the bulk of the book are framed by a narrative in which the adult author goes back to the village where she was raised. These incidents are often dramatic or amusing but they are separate stories and do not cohere to form a conventional plot. The book would have been better as a straight non-fiction memoir. The writing is often graceful but sometimes tends to the seed catalog school of fancy prose e.g. &quot; a sky as pale blue as the scabious that grows with fragile poppies and the scarlet pimpernel sprawling over the marled furrows.&quot;      I enjoyed it, but I had recently read Trezza Azzopardi's &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; and after the impact of that masterpiece of remembered childhood this suffered by comparison.	2001-03-04

An extra layer of metafiction is that she is involved with a Raymond Chandler type private eye. It's not quite up there with Grafton and Evanovich and Elmore Leonard but falls within that category of the humorous mystery. It's also somewhat of a cosy  with a romantic interest but no hard sex and with only minimal violence. Jennifer Marsh herself is the best character - a vegetarian virgin living with a rescued grayhound.	2001-03-02

Both the tragic subject and the density of documentation, with graphs and statistics, make this a hard book to read. The Famine killed over a million people, even on the most conservative estimates. It virtually wiped out the Gaeltacht.    The question that resonates today is whether fewer people would have died if Ireland in 1840 had been an independent country, with its boundaries at the salt water. You'd have to read this book at least, and maybe some others as well, to get an answer to that question.	2001-02-19

The murder plot is secondary to a lot of talk about academic and literary life some of which is clever and informative. The dialog is elaborate and full of phrases such as &quot;If you had decided to embrace the rural life you might in decency have let me know&quot; interpolated with Oscar Wilde type paradoxes, which are sometimes mildly amusing. Many cliches - people are in &quot;hot pursuit&quot; &quot;immured in the library&quot; &quot;deep in conversation&quot; and fall into &quot;fitful sleep&quot;      If you like this you will like Sarah Caudwell, but the reverse does not hold.

The landowner has eaten Peterchen's father. Peterchen sets out to eat what is his. The females hold back (the gender of Flopsy, Mopsy and Kuscheschwanzen is ambiguous - it is hinted that Benjamin Hasche is a fellow revolutionary). The white landowner's structures (Gerateschuppe and Stachelbeernetz) devour the environment to provide him with things to eat. As in so many folk tales of the clever trickster Peterchen is helped by birds and outwits the gigantic MacGregor. He finally escapes into the Geholz - the remaining pristine environment - discarding the emblematic uniform with which his mother has encumbered him.  Was she innocent in his father's death?  She persuades him to take tranqillizing drugs &quot;Einen Essloffel vor dem Schlafengehen einnehmen&quot; and in the final scene, with Peterchen in drugged sleep, capitalist values triumph as the siblings become completely anthropomorphic and feast on manufactured store-bought food.	2001-02-02

Having lived in Britain and visited Germany in the fifties and come to America in the sixties I could identify with much of it.            Lodge tries to use the US/UK contrast to make a point about the uses of adversity and the trauma of poverty. The problem with this is that, as a paradigm of restrictiveness and backwardness the England of 1951 wasn't that bad.  I meet people now in the US from Bangladesh, Egypt, Haiti and points East and South for whom the culture shock of American wealth and freedom is infinitely greater.  Fiction may not be the right vehicle for the point he wants to make. I understood more from the introduction (in which he suggests that the poverty of 1950's Britain was due to government policies)and the epilog.     In the introduction he mentions an epilog by Don Kowalski that was excised from the original edition and has not been reinstated in this one. It would be interesting to read that.	2001-01-26

They have small private incomes (Matty has 127 pounds a year and a pound contained a third of an ounce of gold - a new silk dress costs five pounds) and observe lives constrained by etiquette and class distinction. It has been praised for its &quot;gentle&quot; humor (although I was chilled by the &quot;Irish beggarwoman&quot; saying her children were starving who gets the door shut in her face).           I think you have to have a certain interest in how life was lived in 1850 to read it through. In this edition, with the explanatory note it is mine of information on domestic arrangements. The narrator often points out how old-fashioned these ladies are and what fasions are new and draws comparisons going back over fifty years. This adds an extra dimension.  The train has arrived but sedan chairs are still used. Some of the explanatory notes are written in British English that needs more explanation to Americans. The introduction by Charlotte Mitchell says a lot more about the place of this book in feminist history.     Basically it is something you'd read for historical interest rather than immediate entertainment. I did not laugh out loud or find it hard to stop turning the pages.	2001-01-26

Hynes mixes it with supernatural horror, acknowledging, and at times deliberately pointing out his debt to Lovecroft, MR James, Poe and even Clive Barker.

One is about a group of ex-judges in jail blackmailing closet homosexuals by threatening to out them. The other is yet another version of the tired old Manchurian candidate plot. Some of the dialog between the villainous CIA Director and his stooge presidential candidate consists of cliche-studded lectures about politics (the congressman is astounded to learn that Russian democracy is unstable).      When the two schemes collide, about half-way through the thick book, the plot thickens, and we are in real Grisham country. After that I couldn't put it down, but if I hadn't known it was a Grisham I might not have read that far.	2001-01-22

The narrative technique is unique. The story is told in a series of episodes written in the present tense. They are exactly flashbacks but jump backwards and forwards in time. The effect is like taking old photographs out of a box and looking at them in random order (photographs often figure within the text as if to point out this analogy). Gradually more and more horrific secrets are revealed and the tension builds up.        Almost equally distinctive is the community she describes - the cosmopolitan ghetto of the docks area - sharply cut off from the rest of Cardiff, as Cardiff is culturally cut off from Wales. (The picture of Maltese culture is not flattering).        Wonderful prose which other reviewers have quoted, but thousands of writers can do wonderful prose. This is something new in fiction.	2001-01-21

I rather suspect that this is also meant to stop us thinking that this is close to another English novel that started off a genre of light=hearted comic romances about young women looking for Mr Right and sizing up the talent - I refer of course to Pride and Prejudice.       On page 70 someone gets murdered and then it turns into a whodunnit. The Brooklyn Heights atmosphere is very good. She tends to repeat her jokes = throwing the I Ching, sizing up male sex appeal, talk about different kinds of coffee.       I'm not qualified to say whether it offers any deep insights into sisterly relationships.  The sisters I know aren't impressed.        This all sounds negative - so why five stars?

The animals include bears, flamingos, deer, African bullfrogs and even dogs. The people are cowboys, ornithologists, Mormons, biochemists, gymnasts and cheerleaders.      Quite delightful.

Actually there are too many nice people in this. Her nice people are too nice.     The main plot (almost subsidiary to the romantic interest sub-plot) is about an abortion-related death in a small New Mexican town. It's not very plausible (unless New Mexico has no Medical Examiners, Coroners, Inquests, Autopsies, Maternal Death Inquiry Committtees, State Health Departments or District Attorneys or none of them have telephones).

This is 200 year-old English and takes persistence and I get upset when readers are disappointed. It's about a young woman in an English village trying to make matches for all her friends and getting into trouble. Deaths and sex take place way off stage. Some critics complain that Jane Austen ignores them but she is sharply aware of them.  When Mrs Churchill dies it's a joke (People's opinions of her improve because she proves her ailments were not imaginary) The death of Emma's mother takes half a sentence and she is replaced by &quot;an excellent woman as governess&quot;. Jane Fairfax's father is killed in action (presumably against Napoleon - or maybe the Americans) Harriet Smith is the daughter of a tradesman decent enough to support her but not married to  her mother. Women have no careers open to them and totter on the edge of poverty unless they inherit money or marry. An old man with rheumatism has to apply for parish aid.	2001-01-12

It's about a self-destructive pair of alcoholics. You can see flashes of the meticulous unadorned realism of the master. I don't think it's giving anything away to say that the fact that the protagonist is African-American is brought in at the end as what the author must have thought was a plot twist. It is interesting if you are into the early history and development of the hard-boiled noire and its transition into today's thriller. Some of these early writers were quite bad at times. Try (you'll have to try hard) reading some later James M Cain. Willeford moved about in style a lot. He got better as Cain got worse. I see that the soft-boiled &quot;Burnt Orange Heresy&quot; is in print but &quot;Miami Blues&quot; (the masterpiece for me) is not. Chacun a son gout.	2001-01-03

I'm intrigued by the reviewers from different countries. One Italian reviewer comments that it is more difficult in Italian and in fact I noticed that the translation by Weaver abridges considerably. Was it dumbed down for English monoglots? Surely &quot;stat pristina rosa nomine nuda tenemus&quot; should be translated &quot;If the pure name of the rose (that is to say the rose deprived of its smell and color)stands, all we hold is the naked name of the rose. Try Frayn's &quot;Headlong&quot; for an explanation of nominalism (and for piling in the cultural references). &quot;Island of the Day Before&quot; was more difficult for me to finish.

This is very difficult Welsh. Fortunately the English text by Richard Morgan Loomis (published by the Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Studies, State University of New York at Binghamton) follows the same edition so you have almost a parallel text if you have both. The language barrier impedes judging it honestly as poetry. Judgement is futher impeded by the fact that much of Dafydd's skill lay in his use of strict Welsh metric forms which are untranslatable. The picture of Welsh life in the fourteenth century is fascinating.	2001-01-01

It begins as a Kafaesque tale of a functionary in a totalitarian country conscripted to deal with a nuclear or biological disaster. It becomes more dreamlike. The protagonist constantly finds himself in bleak or claustrophobic setting surrounded by callous authorities. Cruelties seem to be going on all around him but he cannot be sure what they are and is helpless to stop them. Bardo is the Tibetan Book of the Dead. The cover says &quot;What if the 20th century lived as a character and what if that character dying passed though a Bardo state.&quot; (Didn't anyone ever have any fun in the twentieth century). The back cover refers to &quot;the massive coronary that ends his own life.&quot; More clarification would have been welcome. Some predictable liberal targets are hit. Can we equate My Lai (halted by a brave American airman, reported in American newspapers and punished by an American court) with Babi Yar? Yes there are parellels but they need rational discussion not fictional polemics.   This is very different from Love Queen of the Amazon (understatement of the year) but even that showed a pessimistic view of human nature and a delight in puzzling the reader. Pineda still seems want experiment and intrigue. I hope she will condescend to entertain and explain.	2000-12-31

The farcical plot is loaded with long stretches about art history, the way some thrillers are loaded with technology. It's as well that we should not forget the atrocities in the name of religion committed in the Netherlands and Frayn does a worthy job of reminding us. (Motley's Rise of the Dutch Republic sits in my library but I had to stop reading it because of the sickening cruelties described). I think there's supposed to be some symbolism about the Catholic/Protestant divide and the flawed hero's marriage. It was funny in parts but I think comic genius is rare and Frayn just does not quite have it. The present tense is used throughout and I found this intrusive.	2000-12-30

The politics are intrusive - and I'm not any Rush Limbaugh/Bob Grant follower. As an antidote I would recommend Fool's Gold by Jane S Smith which makes good fun of the feminist left.      The plot is initially concerned with the politically motivated kidnapping of a left-wing professor's husband but becomes complex and ulimately more ingenious than plausible. Nevertheless this contains some witty dialog, memorable characters and sharp obervations on the academic scene. An excellent dog.	2000-12-18

Short stories that sometimes lapse into incoherent surrealistic stream of consciousness. The understandability is often further reduced by phonetic spelling of dialect. The phonetic spelling assumes that the reader normally speaks Southern British English (for example &quot;game&quot; spelled &quot;gemm.&quot;) At times it is absolutely brilliant with dark humor describing the way the shiftless (often homeless and destitute) make ends meet by welfare and panhandling.

A man thinks he may have killed someone but is scared of finding out if he did. He tries to conceal what happened, tells himself he was not to blame, that it was an accident, that the victim deserved it. The net closes around him and he is pressured to confess.    It's set in Tunis amongst a group of ex-patriates. I agree with the reviewers who say she's a bad writer. Highsmith  breaks all the rules of fiction. When she wants to give back story she stops the action dead for a long chunk of exposition. She intrudes irrelevant peices of business that have nothing to do with the plot. She includes banal conversations that lead nowhere. Somehow this works for her. She makes you believe that these things could be happening in a boring everyday world and then hits you with bizarre violent action. The effect is mesmerizing and I find I keep coming back for more.	2000-12-04

The murder suspect is found standing over the body of her ex-husband with the usual bloody weapon in hand. The detective is a mystery author wannabee and, aided by a writing group, considers ways to clear her, writing alternative solutions to the mystery as she goes along.      The setting is Macon and Atlanta. The tone is light and humorous with about as minimal violence as a murder mystery can get away with and with a chaste and cosy romantic interest. Two good canine characters.	2000-11-25

The syle is mannered and the narrative is carried by implausibly long letters written in Augustan prose.       Die-hard Caudwell fans already know that, and for us the only discussion is the place of this one, with its all-to-prophetic title, in the canon, now forever reduced to the number of the Gospels. In this one she offers us a version of the traditional English cosy, with a village and a vicar and a spinster aunt. The erudition is a shade less esoteric than in some of the more demanding ones and there is less straight heterosexual sex (although this is made up for in other directions). The twists of plot as the book climaxes are breath-taking, but are merely icing on the cake of suberb prose, biting wit, and deft characterization.	2000-11-12

We know who did the murder from the beginning and we are given some of the story from the viewpoint of the villains. Kicklighter and Jackleen are great characters and there's much insight into being a retired male and someone living on minimum wage. The Fountain of Youth Hotel and Bondurant Motors are well done. My trouble was with the villains - well they're fairly good villains but three other Florida thriller-writers have given us great villains. I kept comparing this with Leonard's &quot;Maximum Bod&quot; and Hiaasen's &quot;Striptease&quot; and Willeford's &quot;Miami Blue.&quot; I know they were set on the opposite coast but it's all one state to me. The car talk was good but Seranella does it better.         Making these comparisons knocked off a star but this is excellent page-turning entertainment.

The author is evidently not only a master of many subjects and an excellent writer but a nice man. Much of what he writes debunks and deflates the cherished beliefs of neo-pagans and witchcraft adherents but he is never sarcastic or unkind and he goes out of his way to show his respect for the believers.  He goes from archeological findings about prehistoric Britain to the anthropology of folklore and it's disillusionment all the way. The things we thought were survivals are mostly modern fakes.

I thought this was the best of the three. The plot is believable from beginning almost to the end (I never quite buy those heroine-save-in-the-nick-of-time scenes but they seem obligatory in this female private eye genre which is a descendant of romantic suspense). It unfolds piece by piece rather than being a series of interviews and the murderer is the kind of surprise that has you turning back pages and saying &quot;why didn't I think of that?&quot; Some great writing. I loved a scene where she describes a vivid temptation to buy Krispy Kreme doughnuts and then looks across the street and describes a crack-buying transaction.	2000-10-12

Some are historians who judge a book by its accuracy, as a mathematician would judge a treatise on pure mathematics. Some read history for pleasure, as a tourist visits an ancient ruin and is entertained by the stories of the guide. Some (including, in this case, myself) read to answer such questions as that raised in the introduction. Are such structures as the family &quot;hitherto believed to be invariable because they were biological&quot; due to nature or nurture?   I would not pretend to judge as a professional historian.  As pure entertainment I would rate this below old-fashioned narrative history. If a general reader wants entertainment from the French annalistes then I would recommend the Braudel. It is very France-centered and never ventures outside Western Europe. The tranlation must have presented difficulties since so much depends on the nuances of such terms as &quot;child&quot; and &quot;adolescent&quot; and the use of the second person singular. Sometimes a word such as &quot;greenhorn&quot; is repeated many times, as if it were the usual English expression for a novice or neophyte (was Baldick translating blanc-bec or debutant or dupe?

The whole art of the noir genre is that you get to be on the side of the criminal and many other writers have done this. Highsmith is the mistress of the art, however. She gets us really indignant at those who persecute someone just for a few murders. I was initially critical of the way the motivation of some characters is left unexplained but now realise that that adds to the hypnotic atmosphere. I notice a dispute between reviewers about the time interval between books in the series. In The Talented Mr Ripley he crosses the Atlantic by boat. This one seems set in the eighties or nineties. What were the publication dates? In what periods are the stories set? Also I could not quite understand both the Pritchards drowning by falling into their garden pond accidentally. The pond is five feet deep with cement sides and mud at the bottom. David might have been trapped in the mud but he shouts to Janice from the water. Did she push him in?	2000-10-02

I have to warn the squeamish that somebody says \\"rats\\", that one character might like men instead of girls, and someone appears on stage in a mini-skirt with a bare midriff (but her father drags her off). A married couple unplug the phone for a hour to do something. There's a lot of nailbiting tension about the plans for Aunt Ruby Lee's wedding. If you can stand all that sex and suspense the mystery is quite well plotted with fairly placed clues. It's set in North Carolina with thick local atmosphere but no mention of race problems (everybody seems to be white if their physical appearance is described). A good-humored blend of \\"Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood\\" and Agatha Christie.   A neat joke in the acknowledgements.	2000-10-01

We are not convinced that the only way to prove Rita innocent is  to find the real killer so the page-turning tension doesn't build up. It's  a series of interviews which are used to bring in memorable characters and  a lot of  information about pop music of the sixties.

V (Phoenix Fiction)	Books	4	8	17	N	Y	Better insights into Canadians than women	It is a coming of age novel, that is to say a thinly disguised  autobiography which, in the male version, always describes a sensitive  youth growing up in a hostile environment where his gifts are not  appreciated, having a series of affairs with women, and ending up a sadder  and wiser man, usually a university teacher. Such plots are necessarily  thin and the descriptions of amatory conquests become repetitious. The  scenes of life in wartorn and communist Hungary, and what it is like to be  a refugee are interesting. He nails Canada. The &quot;older&quot; women  are, in fact, seldom as much as ten years older than the protagonist - none  is over 40. I think in its day the sex descriptions were shocking. The  female characters do not, to me, emerge as three-dimensional. Some of them  are tragic and worn-down and poverty-stricken but they all want one thing  and the hero is kind enough to give it to them. I think that in the year  2000 his view of women is demeaning.	2000-09-08

It stretches to over 600 pages  and yet the author skips over the crucial issue of the voyage to North  America in a single sentence &quot;Now there is not much more to speak of,  for they got a calm sea and passed over rather quickly and without incident  until they raised land.&quot;      My major problem was with the use of  archaic English, so that there were stretches like &quot;What then  Bjorn,&quot; asked Sigrygg, &quot;for I did not seek what has now been  thrust upon me. Nor would it be a service to your kinsmen...&quot; etc. I  know this is a quandary for writers of historical fiction because if you  use modern slang it sounds jarring.      If Mirsky is enamored of the style  of the sagas I think it would have been best to have two parallel  narratives in alternating chapters. One should have been a definite fake  saga, rather like his prologue. The saga style is excellent for hurried  summary of action over a long period of time. The fake saga sections could  have had maps and footnotes and would have carried the plot forward. The  fake translator would have explained that sometimes he has to translate an  old Icelandic expression with a phrase like &quot;to boot.&quot;  Then in  between the fake saga sections he could have written in a completely  contemporary style like Jean Auel or Gore Vidal.       Mirsky has a rare  gift for describing action and the battle scenes were rivetting.  I shall  buy his next book.	2000-09-06

Most of the humor  derives from stereotyping and there's no great dialogue. Sort of Welsh  Agatha Christie. Some of the detail is not authentic. The crown and the  chair are different contests at the National Eisteddfod (the only one with  a robed gorsedd of bards.) The crown is for free verse the chair is for  cynghanedd. Ingenious plotting with no cheating. The clue is planted early  on. No sex and minimal violence.

For example the speech of the lower  classes is transcribed phonetically for comic effect (The English upper  classes being assumed to speak without accents). Literary references are  dragged in coyly. It demands a reader with tolerance and anglophilia. I  picked it up because Amazon's thought-reading machine recommended it to  purchasers of Caudwell. Michael Innes also used to do this kind of thing.	2000-08-24

It meticulously reviews the literature with full and  comprehensive references and statistical tables. Some of these confirm at  lemgth what is commonly received - such as men being more influenced by  physical attractiveness than women.

This one and Lonely Planet  also cover the whole of Crete. Greek Island Hopping has more detail about  actual travelling and about the boats themselves and more maps, but only  touches on the northern ports of Crete. I like all three. Greek Island  Hopping wuuld be most useful if you want to find out how to get to a small  island, or how to get off one.	2000-08-19

Samuel 1 and 2 is a fast-moving, action packed narrative full of sex and violence in the Good  News Bible version (read about King Saul and the witch of Endor) and  contains some of the most wonderful prose in the English language in the  King James version (read David's lament for Absolom). When we read  novelized Bible stories I think we expect some fresh insight and background  research which I didn't think I got. What exactly were judges and prophets  and kings? She could have (I trust) used the Hebrew words and then  explained what they meant to people at the time. Who were Amelekites and  the Philistines and what were their contacts with the Greeks and the  Minoans and the Phoenicians and Egytian? She could have speculated about  this. As it is she tells us nothing that isn't in the Other Version.     I  suspected anachronisms. She has in the first chapter Saul sitting (on  what?) in a &quot;kitchen garden&quot; and a child hiding &quot;under all  the beds in the house&quot; amd maidservants going to the marketplace. I'm  not qualified to know if these were likely but I'd like to know what was  grown in the kitchen garden and what the beds were like and who was allowed  to go to the marketplace. The descriptions of cloths and jewels and  cosmetics were good and sounded (again I'm not claiming expertness)  authentic.      Like others, I suppose, I bought this because I was  intrigued by the publishing history and the New York Times review and  wondered if this was an unfairly rejected masterpiece. It is better than  many bestsellers but not brilliantly original. The author has neatly solved  the dialog problem of historical novels. She avoids &quot;yeah, verily,  forsooth&quot; type writing and jarring modern slang.	2000-08-13

The  style is elaborately witty with nineteenth century diction combined with  descriptions of late twentieth century partying and mayhem. It is all very  artificial and mannered. The plot is about the murder of beneficiaries of a  will and in many ways a classical English whodunnit. The setting is in  London lawyers' (sorry barristers') offices (sorry chambers),lesbian  nightclubs and the Ionian Islands. Lots of sex but never explicit. A lot of  information about English law, classical Greece, sailing and cricket.	2000-08-11

Stream of consciousness for me is okay only if the writer's  name is James Joyce and he's dead, or if it's very well done indeed. This  is very well done. The twelve year old heroine's fantasies dominate the  first part of the book as she lives aloof from other children with her  mother on an ex-hippy farm and idealizes her absent father. He turns up and  gradually turns out to be a lying hypocritical child-molesting fraud.  As  she is disillusioned the book turns realistic. Her character deteriorates  and she starts to relate to her peer group and become popular. This part of  the book was more coherent but I imagine the critical praise was for the  fantasy stuff in the first part which contains a lot of &quot;fine  writing&quot; with some pastiches of sword and sorcery science fiction and  many clever literary allusions. I could have done with cutting down the  fantasy and making her change from dreamy angelic isolation to smart-alec  delinquency more gradual.	2000-08-09

They're all good. Of course if you're  going on a cruise to Mykonos, Delos, Santorini and Rhodes you don't need  these books and you'd be as well off with Frommer, Fodor or Eyewitness. It  doesn't have as much detail as Greek Island Hopping (my favorite for taking  with me, now that Grock's Candid Guides are out of print)but unlike that  book it covers the whole of Crete. Some stuff is obviously lifted from the  same authors' book on Mainland Greece. For example there's a page on the  Greek railroad system which is not going to help you much on the islands.	2000-08-06

Whenever he describes clouds and sky he's great, and when he describes scenery he's  very good - better than James Lee Burke but James Lee Burke does better  characters. I can understand why a lover of the Southwest would love the  book. But then there are passages such as &quot; 'I've got to improvise' he  whispered to himself&quot; (That's a villain planning to kill the hero).  Unlike the Hillermans I've read he does admit that some native Americans  have alcohol problems and shows respect without over-idealisation.  Basically it lacked enough originality to go on my great list, although I  read it and will buy more of McGarrity. There are too many tough embittered  ex-cops already in book form. The good guys were too good and the bad guys  too bad. Terry Yazzi came alive best because he was ambivalent. I like  villains with a touch of humor I can half-way root for.

Bryson is at his most interesting when he describes things that bore him. His descriptions of dull dismal towns held me more than the descriptions of  beautiful trees and mountains. Reading the employee of the month plaque at  a Burger King was one of the best moments. He makes his greatest characters  out of the most ordinary people. Some of the geology and geography and  history was quite good but not great. McPhee does that stuff better. I   preferred his account of his walk around Britain in a way, although it's  not as funny. In that he does not digress but continuously narrates the  journey. I don't suppose you could do that with the Appalachian Trail.	2000-07-30

Food is described in great  detail, but we do not get told what anyone does for a living or how much  anything costs. She has an irritating habit of adding adverbs after the  word &quot;said&quot;.

The parallels are not just a matter of both books being about bumbling spies being comically deceived by false information. They are both set in Latin America and Pendel and Wormwold are both English expats concerned  about their families. I cannot believc that a plotmaster like Le Carre just  ran out of ideas. There is some devious purpose. Grahame Greene was closely  linked with Panama. Is that a clue?     It is a great read in its own  right. Le Carre takes pages of exposition to say what Greene said in a  sentence, but by the same token you get 400 pages whereas OMIH is a mere  novella. Greene barely hints at the Havana atmosphere. LeCarre takes us to  Panama. LeCarre is an excellent writer. Greene was genius.	2000-06-26

If you took away the line breaks it would be a readable story. In fact I think Williams has previously written  &quot;poems&quot; that are continuous blocks and is interested in pushing  the edge of prose.     Anglicisms, such as silver paper and day return and  local London references add obscurity for an American reader and detract  from an apparent intent to avoid poetic language. For example Trivia is  about the way small things can hurt that remind of a lost love. Francis  Thompson wrote &quot;the scent of the rose is bitter to him that loved the  rose&quot; but Williams wants to avoid things like roses so he brings in  names that sound (I think) prosaic and everyday to an English reader.	2000-06-22

On the flights that stop at Thessalonika you have to go through  passport control twice.	2000-06-07

I think the movies have taken up the wicked children idea more than novel writers have. One child stabs a bound captive to death and blames it on the bumbling pirates  who have kidnapped her and gets them hanged. Lots of other other grim  incidents but also many hilariously funny ones, and wonderful description  of sea and tropical life. He writes from multiple points of view as well as  an omniscient narrator, so seamlessly that you never notice the transition.	2000-06-05

I especially recommend the paperback edition where he responds with scathing wit to his critics. Myself I think he blames the 1965 Immigration Act too much. Isn't it jet transport and ease of communication that have  shrunk the world and made it easier for people to switch countries?  Recently my Canadian born daughter visited me from Arizona en route for a  short visit to Egypt to see her American husband there working for a Swiss  company. When my grandmother's much loved brother emigrated from Scotland  to New Zealand at 16 years of age they never saw each other again.	2000-05-01

As a review of research it now suffers from age - 1987 publication. It might be of use if you are doing a research paper and want some early references. To be  fair it's better than some of the other books on remarriage, which are  inspirational or first person with little solid fact.	2000-04-14

It's set in Peru and Bolivia and maybe Brazil, and is full of erudite literary references and wonderful descriptions of old Lima. At first I thought it was real magic realism but then I thought it was a satire of the genre. The heroine is a sort of sexy female Candide. I was just rereading  it and checked Amazon.com for more Cecile Pineda but find everything out of  print.  The only other review is of a novel called  Frieze set in the ancient Orient.	2000-04-10

The original research consisted of looking at courthouse records (which is actually quite a smart idea) and talks with married friends (at  least no interview technique or method of obtaining the sample is  described).  The 91% figure comes from Shere Hite, and the sources quoted  in the text are at that level - which is not meant as a sneer just to warn  that, for better or for worse, this does not contain impressive statistics  and analysis of variance and is not up there with Wolf and Faludi and the  rest as a literature review.

None of them ever has parents or children or siblings or money troubles. If you don't mind those limitations it's an entertaining read. Where was  Violet the week she was late? They find out she wasn't in Goa and then the  issue disappears. Maybe I should reread. But it's not the sort of book you  go back to reread. Light and sexy and enjoyable. Another mystery is what  happened to the other Amazon reader reviews. Reading them made me buy the  book but now they're not there. Some raved and some panned.	2000-03-22

Some of the horror stories from the 1970's and 80's would not happen now. Does that mean that Faludi was over-estimating the power of the backlash? or does it mean that she stopped it by means of this book? Of course a lot  of other horror stories are still happening, especially outside the United  States and Western Europe (although she seems to limit herself to the USA).  A lot of the data is squishy and some (I suppose inevitably) is erroneous.	2000-03-07

This is a reprint of a 1941 work, and the author, Quinn, was born in 1875. He is concerned to defend Poe's reputation against charges of immorality. More background  about the marriage to Virginia would have been interesting. How common were  such marriages in Virginia at that time? Was the full age of 21 claimed on  the marriage bond legally necessary? I don't know if Silverman's 1992  biography has this, I might try it, but 750 pages on Poe is enough for now.

Nothing about the social problems of our age, except a hint of religious controvery about a vicar who uses the old style prayerbook. Lots of old British theatre  (?theater) lore. The author was an associate of Barbara Pym and it's that  type of world. Sort of updated Agatha Christie, although not up to Agatha  Christie's standards of plotting. It won't make you think or change your  life - just enjoy a few hours.	2000-02-16

A great dog and a wonderfully sleazy accountant (he was my favorite character -the heroine is a CPA to compensate). Dialog  always realistic but never crackles. Good on South-Western food.

Unfolding family secrets reminded me of Ross McDonald. Always brings in an extra child by a previous marriage as a plot twist (total of three). Menacing telephone calls to inject suspense surely went  out when caller ID and *69 came in (publication date is '96). Reasons for  not calling in the police are not  very plausible (never are in most  amateur sleuth novels).  The obligatory (for female sleuth books)  &quot;heroine in peril rescued in nick of time&quot; climactic scene  creaked, with 100 word speeches by the villain. No great dialog.  Sounds a  negative review - but it kept me reading and I'll check out her next.	2000-02-01

Who was Merlin? Amazing detective work as the author combs for clues to the darkest of the dark ages. No weird stuff or  new age speculation - real  professional erudition.

I noticed the boat had once been called Penelope. His father comes home from the wars to a faithful wife etc. Very clever and well-written but it got too multi-layered for me at times as the narrative jumped from his present to his childhood and back to Captain Vancouver. Touches of  supercilious anti-tourist misanthropy and misogyny (like Theroux and Waugh)  which he notices himself doing and apologises for.

Somehow Holmes produces scholarly biographies that make compulsive reading. He never fictionalizes or puts thoughts in his subjects' heads that he has no authority for - and yet he keeps us turning those pages. Is  it the subjects he choses? Shelley and Coleridge both had strongly  &quot;plotted&quot; lives. Coleridge married the sister of Southey's wife  and fell in love with the sister of Wordsworth's wife.

If you like like them funny with lots of action with a macho male hero and convoluted double-double cross plots this is for you. Elmore Leonard comes to mind - although the dialog is not quite up to his standards. Flippo is  not quite as rounded a character as Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, and  the prose is not quite as good as Sue Grafton's but this is up there in  that league. Kennedy assasination buffs might love it or hate it, but you  don't have to be one to enjoy it. Dense Dallas atmosphere.	1999-12-04

(Amazon has Greenberg's Language in the  Americas but Campbell's Languages of Native America is out of print) Plot  believability was a problem. A hidden map leading to buried treasure and an  amateur sleuth who takes over from the bumbling police. Great descriptions  of Vancouver Island. Two pairs of sisters - sub-plot about two sisters with  one recalling a horrible childhood and the other not- maybe s literary  novel waiting to get out.

Discrimination? The realistic New York scenes were best.  In the Honduran scenes he veers off into fantasy, which seems influenced by  other Latin American writers. Mirian is a character out of Vargas Llosa.  Perhaps he intends a satire on magic realism but anyway the loss of contact  with reality tended to stop me turning the pages.

So much mourning about the saintly brillant murder victims that it was depressing at the beginning.  Excellent on dogs and horses.

An orally active insulin would be an advantage - not  something you'd want to change. The climactic action scenes are good. As a  heterosexual male I'm probably not qualified to rate the sex.

The rest is speculation, but fascinating speculation. I shall look forward  to Leach's book, which I have on order, but doubt if she can add anything  to this masterpiece.

Eccentric characters do not come across as well on the printed page as they can with the aid of the magic of the camera and  talented actors. Too many of the adult characters are stupid dolts. Thomas  Penman is a pants-soiling, semi-literate child at the beginning, with a  childish inability to undertand the adult world. By the end we have a 15  year old connoisseur of Dickens first editions with a mistress, yet the  action is over a few months. We could have done with more to explain the  change.

No great one-liners like Barnard's &quot;The Chaste Apprentice of Bow&quot; said to be the work of two hands but half a brain. He is too reverential  with some things that should be targets like the &quot;historic&quot;  Wolverine-Dilworth Inn. His food writing is gushy - compare the fun Janet  Evanovich has describing food.

Wilson does a very good job  of conveying the state of mind of the perpetrator - that sense of innocence  so many pedophiles have - but the complete lack of repugnance by the child  is not plausible. This is a literary demerit as well as a moralistic one.	1998-12-31
