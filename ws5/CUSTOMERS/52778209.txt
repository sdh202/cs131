Obviously the beginning of a new series, the author has solved the Jack Ryan problem. Having promoted his original hero out of the action, here the heroes are the son and nephews of the original. But these kids are without depth or much of a back story. Jack Jr., a rich, spoiled?, college grad with no experience talks himself onto a top secret job and assasination. Huh?<br />The author would still benefit from editing (three descriptions of death by poison), but still knows how to make a reader turn the page. The kids need more seasoning and where are all the old guys? Finish this one.	2003-08-28

And the line is cast and we are hooked quickly in another finely written mystery filled with dreams and haunted days. Like all of Burke's work there is depth, introspection and some self criticism. \\" I knew his words could not lessen his anger or ease his sense of betrayal. Eventually he would forgive (her), not at once, not by a conscious choice or arriving at a philosophical moment, but instead one day he would look back through the inverted telescope of time and see her as being possessed of the same moral frailties as himself and hence, in memory, an acceptable part of his life again. But that day would be a long time coming and these are notions you cannot impart to someone younger than yourself, particularly when the individual is your son.\\" Bikers, murderous rodeo clowns, mobsters, and child molesters are the villains and contrasted with beautiful Montana scenery to make this a great read.	2001-08-26

Scars can be inside, as this young man painfully learns, and they can be far uglier than those acid burns he carries. A different pace and view for Parker and his best work in a while.	2001-06-04

We still have the FBI hunting a serial killer, but the bad guy is smart and really doesn't plan to hurt anyone, just the SOB railroads who have done him wrong. Too much time spent on a wacko army officer, detracts from the impact of the story. You'll enjoy the difference.	2001-05-31

An absolutely riveting page turner that is killed by being too complicated. Keep it simple. A good book doesn't need three endings. How do all those bodies go undiscovered? Our hero figures out the complex and overlooks the obvious. Strangers divulge secrets and offer aid without motive. There's a great book coming and I will wait.	2001-04-22

An airliner in distress is about to land and the tension is so well drawn that you will not be able to stop until the first 125 pages are read. But then we are teased with action sequences alternated with transcripts of meetings with people we don't need to know. The author takes time to slap those movie critics who didn't like the film made from his earlier work and generally looses focus. At the end both major players walk away from the game and declare a draw. This is a work that needs an editor, who could have maintained the thrill of the opening.	2000-11-12

Politicians, movie stars, cops and crooks come thru the door. Somewhat disjointed in the telling, we are held enthralled by this tale of not so innocent times. Good read.	2000-11-01

The science is here,the makings of a good story also. But the book never takes hold of the reader, never pulls one along for the ride. I learned about phages, retrovirus and genetics, but didn't have a lot of fun.	2000-10-26

An action-filled finish is indeed a new beginning in the battle against the dark arts. Good job.	2000-10-22

An interesting change of pace from Sandford's other novels gets a little slow in the middle,but contains enough off-beat information to keep a reader going. Good action and a different view point hooks us for more in the series.	2000-10-16

That's the question to ask when reading a book like this or A Night to Remember. Science makes us certain until it proves us wrong. Tragedy on a grand scale. You won't be able to forget some of the images. Picture a wall of debris that plows over a city. Good retelling of a story many of us had never been aware of before.	2000-10-13

Those students were lucky to have a teacher with passion. You will learn a lot about the writer and some about the man. One gets the feeling the autobiographic material was reduced by more than the suggested 10% in this second draft. The story of how he faced his demons could still be out there, but the privacy he desires is evident. You will be rewarded, whether you write or love to read. I discovered I was almost a character in Green Mile. Good job.	2000-10-08

Is his perception changing? Rage as always been a key element to Burke/Vachss and this series continues to evolve. Less action than earlier chapters, but this is as informative and unusual as the others. This series is unlike anything out there.	2000-10-07

This entry involves the least amount of military might, but does utilize a sci-fi robot to carry the day for the revolution that occurs, when big business can't take communism any more. Grafton's task this time is more personal, the rescue of his wife from a gangster. But it somehow seems too easy, though you won't find it hard to keep turning the pages.	2000-09-30

Too long, too repetitious,too little editing,  too many lectures, ...and yet you hang in to read about the new weapons and  details of war.

These heroes were protected by the Boston FBI and that story is told  in this fascinating expansion of the story originally reported in the  Boston Globe.  This tale has resonance all over the US, anywhere the  government uses informants to further its goals, these are the dangers that  await. Good men gone astray, bad men made heroes and the rest of us pay the  price.	2000-08-31

Harris is the best at putting the detective into the mind of the murderer (tip of the hat to John D. and Truman  Capote). Will Graham is a more interesting creation than Clarice.

As with his best stories, Pearson manages to teach us  something about science or technology in this lesson in communication. What  is said,not said, or should not be said, is as important as his  explaination of modern telecommunication techniques. This entry is a better  read than the last couple books.Pearson plays to his strength. Good to the  end. ( How come a smart cop will say something stupid to his wife?)	2000-08-17

This work is filled with facts and trivia, that is fascinating in the  short term, but difficult to sustain the readers' interest over its length.  The narrative is much less engaging than the author's earlier work on  Custer. His research is to be commended. There was little virtue on either  side of these conflicts and we thank the Lord not to have been chosen to  participate. Sex and violence for the greater glory of ...?	2000-08-15

His voice and physicality  were his trademarks. He changed the way Hollywood did business and stars  wielded their power.His social conscience was fascinaing to watch. This bio  provides a starting point for the interested fan, but many questions raised  by the author go without answers, evidence, supporting opinion or  verification. Lancaster chastised Kirk Douglas for his kiss and tell  writings, and perhaps that is a reason why at the end of this bio, we wish  for more.	2000-08-11

A careful reader sees the ending coming  long before one should. Like Reacher, the book feels burdened by house,  girlfriend and responsibility. Put him back on the road, before he stops  being as entertaining as he was in the earlier books.	2000-08-10

It seems to take longer to pick up a Parker novel than it used to. No one  has a leaner writing style. Parker can say more with less words than  anyone, he is a master. But often I wonder if good guys might be more  verbose. The good guys always talk like Spenser. This chapter has less  inventiveness than one would like and ends with a scene not unlike the old  movies drawing-room conclusions. Just once,maybe more would be better.	2000-08-06

The best reads seem to be those that teach the reader something new. Crais educates  us about bomb makers, their sources and fetishes. A new female lead shows  that Crais is not stuck with one character. His focus in the last two books  hints that perhaps he is bored with Elvis, but he is never boring.	2000-07-30

Like the best of his subject's work, Hugh Merrill has fashioned a lean, direct biography of John D. MacDonald, creator of the Travis McGee series. The design and feel of the book transports the reader back to the age of  pulp fiction and early paperback originals. Fans of John D. will find all  the highlights of his career here. Gaps are filled in family background and  some insights are provided to the inner workings of the author's mind and  motivations.  This is not an exhaustive examination of his career but a  very good starting place. One wishes for some more details. How does the  non-athletic youth become the adult who on occasion has grabbed another by  the lapels, or broken up a fight outside Billie Holliday's dressing room?  Does research and work ethic enable a writer to so powerfully describe  casual violence and banality? John D. was a private man who obviously  guarded his feelings. Perhaps the real John D. is most visible in Travis  and Meyer.  An enlightening and informative, easy read that only makes one  appreciate and miss John D. even more.	2000-07-27

Find as many of his books as you can and grow, mature and enjoy the journey. Even before Travis McGee, Mac Donald had been recognized as a master. Stephen King, Carl Hiassen and scores of other writers and millions of fans are thankful for the time we spent under his spell. When your journey in time is done, read this. I did not read this until after his death. This essay made me recall the joy his writing could bring. With an economy of language, we are treated to a proof of the value of the well-read. I do miss him. I miss the anticipation of new work. I await the writer who can match his ability to teach something new while relying on the old values.	2000-03-25

It conveys several perspectives on a complex  situation and teaches us things we did not expect to learn.	2000-03-02

Harris knows the bizarre and exposes his readers to unique and terrible atrocities, as he spins variations of the standard thriller.(The garbage  disposal in &quot;Black Sunday&quot; is an early example.) Our reaction to  the ending measures our ability to think outside the box. Even drugged, is  this how Clarice would slip into submission? Is she as strong as we  remember or has the Jodie Foster performance made more of Clarice than did  Harris? This is not the book we expected but Harris has always surprised  us. You will not be able to ignore this installment.<br />The monster is worth  contemplating. If Clarice can succumb, would we?	1999-12-23
