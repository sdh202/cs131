In his defense, however, I will say that this novella is interesting, for a work that grew out of a play performed by the author and Charles Dickins. It's a typical Victorian melodrama, with coincidences abounding everywhere, and florid speeches and unusual (for our time) actions by the main characters. There really isn't any character development, perhaps because the tale is so short, but you do get into the spirit of the story fairly quickly. It's an entertaining diversion that will keep you occupied for an hour or so.	2005-10-14

This book is one of those that can keep you up well beyond your bedtime, turning pages and reading faster and faster to discover what is going to happen. There is no flagging in the action, and the characters, good and bad, are extremely well-drawn. You get to know the protagonists quite well, and root for them all through the book, no matter what the danger to them may be. I look forward to reading more works from this exciting new author in the future!	2005-10-13

This collection, however, with very few notable exceptions (Stephen King, for one), contains stories that were not very good and did not hold my attention. Some of them were so poorly written that I found myself looking ahead to where the story would end, a sure bad sign for a person such as myself, who lives to read. I honestly expected better from this collection, after the first one was so good, but this was a great disappointment!	2005-10-12

Everyone seems to know the exact time and date of the end of the Great War, but very few realize that the Allies were fighting right up until the last minute. This book examines the stupidity that condemned more than 6500 men to death, and thousands more to permanent injury, after it had been determined that the war was going to end at a certain time. There really was no good excuse for action up to the last minute, as this book very ably shows, but that's what happened, and it's a story that doesn't always get told. I do agree with the conclusion of the author: the only consequence of the Great War was that it led directly to World War II. Read this book, and you will once again be astounded by the utter stupidity of the way-behind-the -front -lines generals and their staffs.	2005-10-11

This author competently enters into the mind of a very unusual nine year old boy, who is in a coma after a fall (or a push) from a cliff into a deep ravine. We read his thoughts, and we follow the actions the the doctor into whose care he has been placed. It's a novel of psychologicl suspense, and also a mystery, not to mention the various twists and turns of the plot right up until the end. It's a book that can keep you up very late at night trying to finish, and I highly recommend it.	2005-10-03

This book shows that there was a thriving society  on that island for years before that event. Rather than see that time as a Dark Age, this book retells the history of a land and a culture that was subsumed after the Conquest. We get the stories of the Anglo-Saxon rulers, the Danish rulers, and the intermarriage with the Norman aristocracy that eventually led to Hastings. Queen Emma successfully bridged the gaps among those three disparate societies, and was the wife of two kings of England, and the mother of two onthers, not to mention the great aunt of Wiliam the Conqueror. It's an exciting story, one that often reads like fiction, but it is all true. Love, greed, murder, betrayal, and all of the other virtues and vices we know so well are present in this tale, and it is well worth reading!	2005-09-30

Our hero travels across the Channel, not once but several times, and spends much time in France. He is actually \\"employed\\" by Prince John, which should come as a shock to the series readers, but the author explains the seeming contradiction. In fact, Prince John comes across as more human than evil personality in this book, and that does make himn a more believeable character. Now that Richard has returned to England, it's going to be interesting to see where next the author takes us!	2005-09-26

It purports to be the journal of the man who tracked, and was responsible for the death of, Dracula. But Dracula is not the focus of this work; rather it is a female vampire who, according to the book, may be the one who \\"made\\" Vlad Tepes into a vampire. There are some rather gruesome scenes, and a side trip to 19th century Iraq, but the quest for the female vampire is left unfinished, although there are some indications in the book that she still exists and seeks revenge on all who searched for her, and also on their immediate families. This isn't great literature, but it doesn't pretend to be; it's rather a pleasant few hours diversion into a subject that still fascinates most people.	2005-09-21

Most histories of the war concentrate on the Battle of the Bulge, which took place at about the same time, and simply ignore this action. The Eastern Front in the war is given short shrift in America, but it is quite important for us today to see how the modern map of Europe came to be. This is a well-written book, but I couldn't get my mouth around some of the Hungarian words, and the unknown street names confused me a bit. The maps were a bit too busy: more concise maps with larger details and less clutter would have been helpful. All in all, though, this is an important contribution to the story of the War in the East that we ignore, and it should be read for its insight into the Russian mindset.	2005-09-19

It's been a very long time since I've read a good, spine-tingling book about Dracula, and then along comes this book! The pace is a bit slow at times, but the mood is very atmospheric, and you really get caught up in the tale. In addition to the basic plot, there's really an excellent travelogue of Eastern Europe both before and after World War II, with emphasis on the Balkans. Also, the historical Vlad Tepes gets his due, as does a lot about the Byzantine Empire. This book combines quite a bit of actual information along with the plotline, and I found that very well done, because it's quite sealess, and you never know when the author is citing history or making up things for the plot. It you like your vampire stories more intellectual than creepy, this is the one for you!	2005-09-13

Stephanie Plum quits her job as a bounty hunter, expecting that this change will normalize her life, and she will no longer be shot at or have her cars blown up, or be the target of other mayhem. Unfortunately for her, but fortunately for us the readers, that expectation does not come true, and once again there are shootings, explosions, and other assorted bad things going on around here. There is also much more about her disfunctional family, and the odd relationship she has with Officer Morelli and Ranger. This is a book to keep turning pages, and when it's done, you'll feel satisfied that you've had an excellent literary ride!	2005-09-07

The tale is excellent, with finely-drawn characters, and just the right touch of eerie Irish countryside atmosphere to set the nerves tingling. There are two msyteries in this book, one several centuries old, and one more recent, but by the end of the book, with all of its twists and turns, both cases are solved. I enjoyed this book very much, and I think that anyone who likes mysteries with a touch of atmosphere and local color, will do the same.	2005-09-07

Just the retelling of the autopsy methods was stomach-churning, but the crimes involved in this work are gory almost beyond belief. Without giving away any of the plot, suffice it to say that there are numerous red herrings strewn about the narrative, and a truly ghastly villain (or possibly two) lurking about in the background, always ready to pounce upon the unwary.

This book, however, asks too much of the reader to really hold him or her in its grip. Granted, the action moves along very fast and furious, perhaps to disguise the gaping holes in the plot. The writing is fairly pedestrian, with no real character development. You just can't seem to really care what happens to the characters, and some of the escapes from death are simply beyond belief! This is a book to read if you have several hours to kill, and nothing better on your bookshelf.	2005-08-30

I knew, of course, that Magellan's fleet made this historic voyage, but I had no idea of the trouble, heartbreak, terror and cruelty that accompanied it. All great adventures seem to be a mixture of every type of action and emotion, and this book covers them as completely as possible. It paints Magellan as a stern taskmaster, but a firm Catholic and an excellent leader, for the most part. That is evident by the shambles that resulted after his death. Read this book and learn something new about Magellan and his historic journey.	2005-08-29

The story grips you from the very first pages, and doesn't let you go until the end. The plot just rolls along, sweeping the reader with it down mysterious lanes, always eager to discover what's happening, and why. I never give out plot or secrets, so it's a little difficult to write a review of a thriller without giving something away.

Although it covers a lot of familiar territory, the interviews with ordinary individuals on all sides of the conflict is tremendous. Not only do you get the \\"big picture\\" of the action, but you also find out how it affected the common folk, not just the leaders. I also found that the author presented a well-reasoned defense of Eisenhower's decision not to race to capture Berlin before the Russians.

Liberals and their ilk will absolutely detest it, and conservatives will simply love it! Since I consider myself a conservative, my rating should come as no surprise, but I honestly believe that I based it on the merits rather than on the book's politics. There are a lot of fringe loonies on both sides of the political spectrum, and they should be skewered for how they have contributed to the coarsening of what passes for \\"debate\\" in this country. We all have to tone down the rhetoric, and seriously attempt to regain some civility toward each other. I would agree with most of the names on the List, and also for the reasons given in the book. Neither side has the edge on virtue, but we must begin by being willing to treat each other with kindness. Calling President Clinton a \\"murderer\\" (as some conservatives have) equates with calling President Bush a liar and a traitor (as some liberals have). Both sides are wrong, and should look deeply inside themselves to see where their particular bias is leading them, and this wonderful country in which we live.	2005-08-11

Our author gives us her version of Marlowe's story, interwoven with a modern day mystery bound up with Marlowe's life and death.

Back in 1938 there was no such ability, and this kiler storm crept upon Long Island and southern New England without any serious warning. The devastation was incredible, and the loss of life amazing. It's a cautionary tale for weather forecasters everywhere about the dire consequences of incorrect or misleading weather information. There are many human interest stories interwoven in this book, some of them with happy endings, some with heartbreak. It's a part of our history that is mostly forgotten now, but deserves to be remembered, and I am very glad that this book was written.	2005-07-25

Not only do we get a rippingly good tale, but we learn more of the political and religious history of this time in the Tudor dynasty.

The plot involves the posible murder of several people, and the atempt by the son of one of them to find out who did it, and why. Intersperced within the plot, and quite relevant to it, is the role of stock-jobbing in England in the early 18th century, when trading was done in coffee houses. There is also a lot of information about the tenuous situation of Jews living in England during that period. The characters are all finely drawn, and the mystery is sufficiently full of twists and turns, and red herrings, that it will keep the reader turning pages far into the night. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel to this excellent book quite soon!	2005-07-15

It's a quite tautly-written thriller, that finally moves along rather briskly once the main plot gets into gear. My one quibble with the book was that I felt that it took much too long for the story to move. The author, I presume, was attempting to set the stage for what was to come in the main plot, but I just felt it was much too far into the book before the action took off. Once it did, however, it was very well done, and quite an enjoyable read.	2005-07-10

With the words above (\\"God's will!), Pope Urban II began the cruading movement in Western Europe in 1095. He wanted to aid the Byzantine Empire, and most of all, recover Jerusalem from the Moslems. This well-written book chronicles that First Crusade, and the leaders who took it across Europe and Asia to the gates of Jerusalem. It is a well-told tale of hardship and heroism, glory and greed, prayer and power. Along the way the author destroys some of the myths about the Crusade with which many of us grew up, having been taught them in school. These crusaders weren't paragons of virtue by any means, but they did have faith in a God who could grant them remission of their sins and entrance into eternal life for carrying out the mission of freeing Jerusalem. This book also shows how, eventually, the conflict between Christianity and Islam came to be started, a a legacy with which we still live today.	2005-07-04

It is a tale that takes place almost entirely in the fictional town of Krishnapur, inhabited by thousands of (unseen to the British) Indians, and a few hundred Englishmen. When sporatic news of the Sepoy Revolt is heard, there are precautions made to protect the Residency and other English property, although the ladies and gentlemen within the compound find it hard to believe that \\"the natives\\" would reject the blessings of British civilization, and turn on their masters. During the seige, there are attempts to keep up a sembnlance of normality, and even class differences remain. This is, in some respects, a comic novel, for there are many humerous parts to it, as the linited knowledge and insight of the occupiers is revealed. We don't get to know any of the Indian characters, as their masters also did not. This is a cautionary tale for imperialists of all countries, and a good lesson to be learned that the indigenous population cannot be safely ignored.	2005-06-27

As usual, there's time-jumping with Thursday's father, the usual friends from Jurisfiction, and even the on and off reappearance of Thursday's husband. Granny Next shows up, and we have some poignant scenes beside all of the slapstick humor. It's a good, funny, and actually thought-provoking book, and well worth reading.	2005-06-26

It's refreshing, but sad, to note that in those days there was relative peace in that region, and folks could travel unmolested around many countries, and across many borders.

It is a history of \\"YANK\\", a publication done completely by enlisted men, for the typical enlisted soldier. Although there were officers in charge, the content was exclusively done by the EMs. The worldwide corespondents, artists and cameramen often put therselves in serious danger to \\"get the story\\" and present it to their readers. There wasn't any sugarcoating of the news, and officers took a real beating in the pages of this paper.

He takes just one year of the American Revolution, and examines it in detail. It was a year of defeats for the American forces, bracketed by victories at its beginning and end. This was a trying time for the Glorious Cause, as was so aptly expressed by Thomes Paine in \\"The Crisis\\". This book is also a character study of George Washington, and his growth as a leader and military man. Were it not for Washington's stubborn belief in success, and his determination to achieve it, the Revolution might have died in that troublesome year.

Most of what happened was rather straightforward, and done by diplomatic means. In any event, this is an extremely interesting book about a little-known subject. Of course, everyone knows the basic story of the taking of Rome from the Pope by the new Italian state, but after that, nothing. This book very well fills in the knowledge gap by showing how the new state \\"bent over backwards\\" to try and mollify the Papal folks, only to be rebuffed at every turn. From the vantage of more than 125 years of Italian sovereignty over Rome, we can see how foolish the fears of the Pope actually were, but hindsight is the best sight. At the time, the Pope felt he was protecting the sovereignty and independence of the Papacy by having a temporal land under his control. This is fascinating history at its best, and I strongly recommend it!	2005-06-02

He's been overlooked by most writers covering that area and that period, so this book is long overdue. I have read several books that retells the history of the British invasion of Afghanistan, and its bloody aftermath, but not one of them mentioned Harlan. This is a great hole in that area's history, and I am very happy that Mr. Harlan has now gotten the recognition he so richly deserves, for he accomplished many things which were not done by other Westerners with greater historical reputations. This is a book well worth buying and reading!	2005-05-27

It goes from Korea to the United States, to Canada, Europe and Africa. There are historical characters mixed in with the fictional ones, and it's very difficult to tell when the historical folks are acting as they would have in reality. The story is quite convoluted, and keeps skipping back and forth in time, and also in place, so that your head begins to spin at times. I can't fault the writing, because it is good, but there's just too much oddity going on to rate it any higher than I have.	2005-05-22

There are one or two on this list who don't necessarily qualify as \\"bad\\", but perhaps \\"misguided\\", or just plain \\"incompetent\\". The nomenclature, however, belongs to the author, and I will not quibble with his choices. That having been said, I will admit that this book reveals a side of the papacy that is somewhat unknown to the average person today. It's general knowledge that there were sone Popes unworthy of their high position, but that's about all most people really know. This book goes into extensive detail about the Popes on the author's list, and it does an excellent job of pointing out exactly what, in his estimation, were their failings. When viewed in the light of the recent papal conclave which elected Benedict XVI, those early elections, influenced by the Roman mob, political considerations, family connections and outright bribery, it's amazing that the Church survived at all! This is a cautionary tale for everyone interested in the history of the Church and its rulers, and will certainly remove the \\"rose colored glasses\\" from the faces of a lot of people.	2005-05-17

When I was in grade school and high school, I was always taught that Peary discovered the North Pole, and nothing was ever said about Dr. Cook. Even in college, as a History major, I was taught nothing about that subject. The first time I learned that there was some dispute about the North Pole was when I read the book \\"The Big Nail\\", probably in the very early '70s. To say that I was shocked would be an understatement! Over the years since then, I have read other works on this subject, and each one brings its own particular bias with it. The author either favors Peary or Cook, and does his best to villify the other person. This latest book is another in Dr. Cook's corner, but it is free from the vitriol that usually populate this genre of works. He takes us through everything about both men and their respective expeditions, but comes down on the side of Cook. After reading several books, I tend to agree with him, particularly in light of Peary's seemingly amazing distances covered when any witness beside his \\"body servant\\" was with him. Also, his absolute refusal to transport Cook's instruments and vital records home on his ship, and then requesting Cook produce them to verify his claim is extremely suspicious. The \\"establishment\\", which backed Peary's work, circled the wagons against Cook and proceeded to castigate him unmercifully. No one will ever know exactly which of the two men reached the Pole first, but this well-written book makes an exceptionally good case for Dr. Cook. Read it and form your own conclusions.	2005-05-13

Through the words of the author, we learn that the heroes of this platoon were almost solely responsible for upsetting the Nazi timetable for the battle, and may possibly have changed its ultimate outcome. It's good that this book is written now, when many of these brave men are still alive to tell their tales. They were true heroes, but modest folk, even disclaiming the title of \\"hero\\" when it was given to them. We should honor these brave people every day, for their actions, and those of the other members of the \\"Greatest Generation\\", have preserved for us the freedom that we hold today, sometimes much too lightly.	2005-05-09

This well-written book should be instrumental in filling in all of the blank spaces about this heroic and dangerous undertaking. We get everything but the kitchen sink in this exhaustive review, and it is information well worth reading, for we tend to forget that humans are always reaching for freedom from tyranny, either a slave owner, or a country's dictation.

Luckily, my wife had a supply of books, so I selected this one, because it looked short enough to cover the time away that we had left. Having read this book, and thoroughly enjoyed it, I am very happy that I selected it. The narration is extremely amusing, and the tale moves along quite quickly. The characters are well-drawn, and even if one hasn't read the other eight books in the series (which I have not done), there's no feeling of missing anything. The plot is solid, although the killer's identity was very clear (at least to me) quite early in the book, and all of the clues were there, but ignored by the good guys. It's a greatr romp and read, and if you have a few hours to kill and want to laugh and be entertained, I recommend this book.	2005-04-24

This latest effort, done by an experienced novelist whom I have read in the past, sends Holmes and Watson, at the request of Mycroft Holmes, to the Scottish residence of Queen Victoria to solve two grisly murders. The plot abounds with strange and mysterious characters, red herrings galore, and a rather garrolous Holmes. There's also the slightest hint of supernatural involvement, which makes it only all the more interesting. I hope Mr. Carr attempts further Holmes adventures, for they will be well worth reading.	2005-04-24

It didn't bog down with a lot of scientific explanations about the causes of the earthquakes, but gave just enough information to help the average reader understand what happened. The book covered the human aspects of the quake, but even more than that, it went into a lurid murder, a history of the Tecumseh indian uprising, and a concise history of the War of 1812. That's a lot of information to be stuffed into a relatively short book, but the author handled it all extremely well, and the book is an excellent example of historical writing at its best!	2005-04-22

Harper are once again embroiled in Wellington's battle agsainst the French in Portugal. As usual, Sharpe has a chip on his shoulder about senior officers, and feels that his commander is favoring an incompetent officer over him because of the commander's marital relationship with the man. There is the usual fighting, a beautiful woman, a nasty villain, and other assorted problens to overcome before Sharpe and Harper are able to return to their army, having been left behind in a city captured by the French. It's exciting as always, and even though you know that Sharpe is going to come through, your heart beats faster at the tense scenes of trouble and danger. I certainly hope that the author has many more Sharpe adventures to tell, for it would be a shame to have this excellent series end.	2005-04-16

This extremely well-written book retells that fatal decision in great detail, and it is never boring. We see how Napoleon's fabled instinct appeared to desert him when it came to Russia, and how his indecisiveness was the main cause of his loss of his army. General Kutuzov's reputation is exposed for the sham that it was, and most of the credit for the Rusian \\"victory\\" is given to the harsh Russian winter, as it should be. This is a fairly well-known story, but the book goes into the fine detail that really explains all that happened. It's one that is definitely recommended for any Napoleon-era buff!	2005-04-12

This book is one of those kinds of reads, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! There are actually two distinct plotlines in the book, both important, and running on parallel tracks throughout. The hero is faced with what appears to be nefarious deeds done behind his back by his own company's officials and board members, and then there is the stalker, whose death fuels most of the excitement. I'm not one to give away plots, or even little hints, but I will say that the tension on both tracks heats up constantly, until the ultimate explosion and ending. If only all thriller writers could be this good, I'd probably never get enough sleep!	2005-04-05

The author admits at the outset that he is not philosophically in tune with the GOP, but that he will endeavor to be fair and accurate. For the most part, he remians true to that pledge, although at times it is quite possible to feel the animus attempting to break through the veneer of historical accuracy. For all of that, it is a well-written book, and does reveal some other interpretations of history, different from what we were taught to believe was true in school. This book is worth reading to see how a political party is founded, grows, matures, and changes its beliefs in step with the way the world around it changes.	2005-03-28

This is the young, white-wigged Rumpole, beginning his legal carreer at Equity Court, as pupil to Uncle Tom, even then the golf playing indolent we know from the television series. There's a rare treat in this book, and it's the story of the \\"courtship\\" between Rumpole and Hilda, even then She Who Must Be Obeyed. It's been a long time coming, but this book is definitely a fabulous treat for all Rumpole fans, and may our author continue to give us tales of our favorite Old Bailey hack!	2005-03-21

I have read three previous biographies, but this latest one is the best by far (definitely an improvement on \\"The Man On The Flying Trapeze\\"). We are given more detail, and more intimate information than was previously available, and the book delves deeply into the behind-the-scenes making of Fields' famous pictures, including the two-reelers, a few of which I possess. He was a more complicated man than most people know, and certainly more of one than they learned from other books about him. Not only is this his biography, but it takes us through vaudeville, burlesque, Ziegfield, and the early movies, both silent and talkies. There are also the forays into radio, and the \\"feud\\" with Charlie McCarthy. It's a well-written and well-rounded work, and may remain the definitive biography for a long time to come.	2005-03-18

According to Sherlock Holmes in this excellent book: \\"He's as real as I am!\\" That line alone was worth the purchase price of the book. Once again, Ms. King has given us an excellent tale of suspense and adventure featuring the intrepid Mary Russell and her husband Sherlock Holmes. In this one we are transported to British India in 1924 on a search for the missing Kimball O'Hara, the grown-up urchin of Kipling's book. Along the way we meet the usual odd assortment of characters, every one of which is well-drawn, and not just a cipher. The action moves along at a fast pace, and certainly keeps the reader turning pages quickly. There's also a very good history lesson embedded in the book, one worth knowing about the course of empire. As always, I highly recommend this series, and will await the publication of the next installment with impatience.	2005-03-12

This extremely well-written book examines not only the course of the disease, but emphasizes the scientists and medical professionals who worked tirelessly to combat this scourge. Along the way the reader learns of the transformation of American medicine from relieance upon centuries-old methods to a new, improved emphasis on education and training. The foundation of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore is the starting point for this revolution in thinking and practice, and that beginning spread across the coubntry, luckily in time to begin to combat (but, unfortunately, not defeat) the influenza. This is a gripping tale of persistence and research that is well told, and even if the science at times appears to bog down the narrative, it is always fascinating. As a parent whose daughter in currently engaged in post-doctoral medical research, I can empathize with those hardy souls who \\"pushed the envelope\\" of experimentaion and research to, hopefully, find a cure for this disease. This is a book well worth reading to anyone interested in the history of modern medicine and medical research.	2005-03-10

This extremely well written book just does not concentrate on the facts of the Texas Revolution in general, and the battle of the Alamo in particular. It is, rather, a record of the author's personal journey to discover the facts and the truth about what happened in 1835-36 Texas. We follow along almost breathlessly as he navigates through many contradictory opinions, and works himself into a place where he feels that he has found a truth that conforms with his researches. He is not so bumptious as to assume that his truth is the truth, but it suffices for him based upon his research. It's a fascinating journey, and we learn many new things about the Texas Revolt against Mexico, and what may have ben the ultimate fate of Davy Crockett at, or after, the battle for the Alamo. Perhaps we will never know with certainty what exactly happened, but for now I am content to accept the author's conclusions, until something different, and more convincing, comes along.	2005-02-28

As usual, our Old Bailey hack is up to his old tricks, baiting judges, reciting poetry, and faering the wrath of She Who Must Be obeyed. Having been a fan of the television series, I can picture the characters in my mind, and the late Leo McKern will always be Rumpole to me, just as Jeremy Brett remains the essential Sherlock Holmes. These tales are delightful, but my one complaint is that the book is much too short! I could go on reading Rumpole for weeks and never tire of him.	2005-02-28

We get \\"up close and personal\\" with many of the Tibetan citizens, and the author examines how the people are adjusting to living under the domination of the Chinese.

It takes quite an effort to hold it up or prop it up to read, but the effort is well worth it. The first time author has presented an early 19th century England that had once been divided north and south into two different kingdoms, the northern half ruled by the Raven King, a human/fairy magician. We are introduced to two magicians whose task it becomes to restore magic to England, since the magic has basically been forgotten. There are amusing side trips into Wellington's Peninsula campaign, and a new view of how the Allies won the battle of Waterloo. This is also a book that covers, in a light-hearted way, the social classes and the differences between them. It's somewhat of a comedy of manners in part, and also a mystery and a search for something elusive. Despite the length and the size of the book, reading it from cover to cover was not a chore, because the author keeps the reader continually interested in finding out what was going to happen next. This is a very good book, and I highly recommend it!	2005-02-20

What is the significance of all of this, and are there implications involved with the war effort? It's good to see the old man creaking and groaning, but doing his old business of ferreting out what really happened, well before the police, as usual. The language of the book is excellent, and for that alone it is well worth reading. Sherlockians should rejoice at this latest appearance of their hero!	2005-02-20

As a practicing attorney, I found much of the courtroom action fascinating, particularly how a lot of the \\"evidence\\" against the black defendants was introduced. Hearsay was allowed, and I wonder if it was simply because of the race of the accused, or was it simply the way things were done back in those days. Anyway, the story itself is remarkable, especially because of the many black and white citizens who worked together to help the three women accused in this horrible crime. This was before the Jim Crow south materialized, and a time when the races were not exactly segregated, but in many places lived and worked side by side. There are some very honest and honorable whites involved, and many crusading blacks who sensed the injustice that was being attempted. We may never know who the true murderer or murderers were, but this tale is a cautionary one about jumping to conclusions based solely upon race. We can all learn a great lesson from this book.	2005-02-08

Happily, this book falls into neither catagory, but steers a middle line when discussing the life of our first president. The reader receives both the good and the bad of Washington's life, not that there is a lot of \\"bad\\" to go around. In a relatively short book, as this one is, it is not possible to go into all the many twists and turns of a famous life, and inevitably some things are left out of the writing. For instance, the discussion of Washington's two terms as president is rather skimpy, but to go into a lot of detail about incidents both domestic and foreign would, at least, double the length of the book. This work concentrates rahter exclusively on Washington the man, his life and actions, and delves into, as far as is possible at this time distance, his reasons for doing many of the things he did. It's very well written, and even the reader with no background in that period of American hitory will find it extremely informative.	2005-02-04

Everyone knows, at least in some way, the story of WWII and the Occupation of Paris, but most of us do not know what happened in that city, and in France, after it was liberated. This book fills in our gap in that knowledge quite well, and it shows that France was really on the front lines of the Cold War during the latter part of the 1940's. We read of the humanitarian and generous contributions of the US to the initial recovery of France, and how its leadership strove mightly to regain a stable government while. at the same time, trying their best of overcome the stigma of Vichy. What amazes me is that there is such a lack of gratitude among the French to the US for all that we have done for them in the 20th century. This book shows that, once again, \\"No good deed goes unpunished\\".	2005-01-28

That's the reason we have his two children assisting in this tale,and I assume that they will be featured in future books. The plot is the unsual fast-paced one, going by so quickly that the reader doesn't even notice the holes in it. One thing that bothers me, though, is the way that the author, Alfred Hitchcocklike, insists on inserting himself, as a deus ex machina, in every story. The first time or two it happened, it was new and fun, but now the reader knows that, somewhere down the line when one of the heroes (or heroine) is in trouble, along will come Clive Cussler to assist. Stop it already! Let us enjoy the exciting ride without the annoyiny \\"stage left\\" entrance! No matter what, however, I will continue to read these books, because I enjoy them as a quick relief from more serious works, and a good page-turner for cold, wintry nights.	2005-01-24

That has not stopped many folks from attempting to do so, however. This book is another in that train, and I found it fairly well-written, although my attention wandered at times while reading it. The author has done his best in this book, but it is riddled with \\"perhaps\\", \\"possibly\\", \\"it could have\\", and other qualifiers of that ilk. The examination of many of the plays, however, is first-rate, and for that alone the book is worth reading.	2005-01-19

Jimmy Buffett is a true Renaissance man: singer, songwriter, businessman, pilot, world traveller, and probably other things that I haven't mentioned, including best-selling author. I love his music, and I really enjoy his writing! This new book is a pleasant piece of escapism, and something good to read during the gloomy days of winter here in Pennsylvania. When I read it, I feel that I'm on some tropical island cavorting with a mery benad of misfits and unusual folks. Jimmy's tale, like a lot of Thomas Hardy, depends upon coincidences that tend to stretch credibility quite a bit, but my theory is to just go where the author leads you, and hang on for a pleasant ride. The characters are fairly well-drawn, although a few tend to be \\"stick figures\\". The book kept me turning pages late into the night, and the CD packed with it was a very welcome bonus. Parrotheads of the world, rush to get this book!	2005-01-05

Garfield	Books	5	5	5	N	N	History that reads like fiction	This is a real \\"behind the scenes\\" look at the Republican convention of 1880, and its shocking nomination of James A. Garfield for President. It shows how the longlasting animosity between Roscoe Conkling and James G. Blaine resulted in a convention stalemate and an ultimate rush to Garfield as a compromise. It talks about the close election of that year, and goes into Garfield's stand against the vanity and just plain stubbornness of Conkling concerning the \\"spoils\\" of victory. It also traces the path of the assassin, and shows that he really was a demented soul, who felt he was doing his party, and the country, a favor by eliminating Garfield. It's an exciting book, and truly reads like the best of fiction. This is a really little known aspect of our history, and should be a \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in how our political system evolved into what it is today.	2004-12-30

Most people's thoughts about the Bounty mutiny are inevitably based upon the Charles Laughton - Clark Gable movie. There we saw a tyrannical Capt. Bligh and an almost saintly Fletcher Christian. It seems that literature has painted Christian as the \\"hero' of sorts, with Bligh playing the \\"evil captain\\" part. This book attempts an even-handed explanation of what happened on the Bounty. Due to many contradictions in testimony, even from eyewitnesses, this was difficult, but the author has handled the situation quite well. The book reads, at times, like a novel, which makes page-turning a pleasure. All readers will certainly find something new about this famous mutiny within the pages of this book, and I highly recommend it.	2004-12-19

It has a well thought out plot, although I found a few improbabilities in it, though they didn't keep me from enjoying the read. I don't like to give away anything about mystery or thriller books that I read, but I'd just like to say that you shouldn't take anything at face value when you read this book. There are a lot of red herrings and blind alleys, which add to the tension of the work. I think this author has a fine future as a thriller writer.	2004-12-10

I prefer my political books with a humorous side, and though this one tries, it really doesn't succeed well. I'm sure that the author is well-intentioned, and he makes quite a few valid points, but it's a bit heavy-handed to me, although I agree with a lot of what he has written. The conservative talking points which it includes are well worth the price of purchasing the book.	2004-12-07

Nonetheless, his definitions may cause liberal eyebrows to rise, and liberal gorge to rise, especially when he skewers Senator Clinton and her \\"secret\\" diary. It's all in good clean fun, though, and should be taken that way by every reader. I know that's not possible, because liberals really don't have a well-developed sense of humor, but they should try, anyway!	2004-12-05

This excellent work does both, the action taking place in the foreign Concessions of Shainghai in 1926. We see a varied cast of characters, and the plot leaves the reader guessing as to the motives and loyalties of each one. The author successfully invokes the moral ambiguity of the period, and the tale moves along fairly swiftly. This is one book well worth reading, and I recommend it highly!	2004-12-04

It covers all of the major, and also the minor, areas of the war, and though it doesn't concern itself with the minutia of tactics (which bore me to tears anyway!) it explains what happened and why during those four terrible years. If you don't wish to get bogged down in a lot of extraneous material, but just want to read the esentials of this tumultuous period, this is the work for you!	2004-11-29

(I don't read other reviews of books I'm going to review, so I don't unconsciously regurgitate what others may have writen). Since I've given this book a 5 star rating, I'll obviously be ranked with the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy by those among us who adhere to the liberal persuasion, and they would be correct, for the most part. I grew up with liberal ideas, but getting older, holding down a job, raising a family and paying taxes, changed me into a conservative of a sort. Winston Churchill once said \\"If a man isn't a liberal when he's young he has no heart, and if he isn't a conservative when he's older he has no brains!\\" That may be overstating the case a bit, but Ms. Coulter does a good job of skewering liberal with every stroke of her word processor. I don't agree with everything she says, or espouses, but for the most part I believe in her writing. Not all conservative causes are my causes, but I shed no tears over the elections of 2000 and 2004, and am quite pleased at their results. I'm a lawyer who firmly believes that the trial lawyers are screwing up the health care industry in this country royally, but on the other hand I believe in strong gun registration laws. See, not all conservatives are rabid bomb-throwers! Some of us actually live quietly in rural areas, doing our jobs and raising our families as best we can, going to chucrh regularly, and saluting the flag when it goes by in a parade. Read this book: you'll either nod and smile with recognition, or scream out loud with indignation!	2004-11-24

This is a fantasy that takes place in an alternate America, one in which some people have \\"knacks\\", that is, the ability to do unusual things . Our hero through the six books of the quest so far is Alvin Maker, who can do a lot of things very well, but he's burdened with an overcautious conscience, that often propels him into trouble, and keeps him from using his \\"knacks\\" to extricate him from these troubles. I like the series because we meet historical characters in often quite different contexts from their historical reputations, and the geography of the country is greatly different from actuality. It's a tale worth telling, and a tale I enjoy very much reading!	2004-11-19

This was a crusade not led by monarchs, but rather like the First Crusade, an undertaking of many nobles of good family. The addition of the Venetian seamen with their needed ships, and an ill-advised agreement about men and money led this holy endeavor to attack, not the occupiers of Jerusalem, but rather the also Christian rulers of the Byzantine Empire. It's a somewhat convoluted tale, but the author tells it extremely well, and at no time does the reader feel that he is lost. This book gives some insight into the schism that exists still today between the Orthodox and Roman churches, and is excellent reading for anyone interested in this fractious history.	2004-11-16

Those of us who have been faithful followers of this journey for many years must feel some type of relief just to have it done! Once again, Mr. King has labored and brought forth another doorstopper of a book, winding up (so to speak) his gunslinger's multi-thousand page search for the Dark Tower. It's a book of joys and sadness, heroism and heartbreak, and I won't spoil the plot for anyone who has not yet read it. There is going to be a lot of grumbling by readers about the ending (even Mr. King admits that), but I for one always accept the world that the author creates and the conclusions that he draws from it, whether I agree with what he does or not. It's a work that may or may not stand the test of time, but it was a great ride while it lasted, and I will miss Roland, Eddie, Suzannah/Detta, Jake and Oy!	2004-11-03

The credit is surely due because there are, unfortunatley, not a lot of information sources about Theodora, and the most complete source is Procopious's \\"Secret History\\", which can in no way be considered a glowing tale of her life. It's quite a salacious read, and perhaps gives one a somewhat distorted view of Theodora, and her upbringing. The auhtor of this work attempts a delicate balance between the \\"anti\\" sources, and the other reports of the reign of Justinian and his consort. The result is a book that has many nuances, but appears as fair as possible given the sources and the pasage of time since these events occured in world history. Often the author is driven to psychological speculation over why actions were taken or not taken, and he can't be faulted for his approach, given the situation. Anyone attempting to adequately reconstruct ancient events without proper historical help is going to have this problem, and I feel the author has done as well as can be expected. The book is a good view into the Justinian court, and the life of the Byzantine Empire of the time.	2004-10-25

As a lawyer myself I laughed uproariously at some of the antics of these \\"gentlemen of the bar\\". Even though this work takes place almost two thousand years ago, I easily recognized some of the legal types in it as folks I can encounter almost every day in court. The work reminds me of the Rumpole books, although there is more emphasis on the investigation aspect of the case than the legal side. It's very well-written, as I've come to expect of this series, and full of red herrings and twists and turns for the reader. I hope that Falco makes a very long career in Rome, and that we, his faithful readers, get to read all about that career!	2004-10-18

This is what happened with this book, for I just happened to see it sitting on a table of new paperbacks and, intrigued by the subject, glaced quickly through it. The writng, descriptive and lyrical, compelled me to purchase this book, and I am very happy that I did. There is a well-constructed plot, with numerous twists and turns, and confusions of identity. The reader sees the main characters go off in diferent directions, but in the end, everything comes together in a very bittersweet ending. We ned writers with this type of prose virtuosity, and I for one will look forward to the next work written by this gentleman.	2004-10-12

That was such an interesting time period in history, and many things happened while the regime was slowly crumbling from within. This extremely well-written work of fiction adds another aspect to the time when everything was collapsing. There are mysterious murders, and one of the victims worked for the Imperial family. We go into the lair of the secret police, and into the center of the royal family itself, where the tsarina makes a cameo appearance. There are imperial servants, spies, revolutionaries, and our hero, an honest man trying to do his job while all falls arart, including his own family. It's essentially a sad tale, but one that really involves the reader. I enjoyed this book so much that I ordered \\"The Master of Rain\\", another work by this same author, and I expect to enjoy it as well.	2004-10-12

Although our age difference is about 24 years, and his high school years were the late 1930's while mine were the early 1960's, a lot of the things about the town which are included in his book didn't change from his time to mine. The theatres were still there, and a few of the restaurants (as a matter of fact, I grew up two doors away from Matucci's, the Italian restaurant he mentioned). Some of the games he played, and some of the activities (such as hanging on to the back bumper of cars on snowy streets and getting a \\"ride\\" for a few blocks) my friends and I also did. It's a book awash in nostalgia for a way of life that is now gone from this area, and that I miss quite a bit. The author is not a tremendously accomplished writer, but his love for the town of his youth, and the people he knew, shines through quite well. I think that anyone coming from a small, hard-working town full of immigrants would recognize a lot of things in this book, and enjoy it, as I did.	2004-10-04

This first-person work by a Russian officer on an ill-fated Arctic journey from 1912 to 1914 is certainly a very exciting one, even though the author tends to be laconic at times about his exploits. He tells the story of his ship becoming icelocked, and then of his trek, with several other companions, across the trackless wastes of the Arctic to look for a safe haven on distant land. It's quite compelling, and makes for very gripping reading. The paperback edition of this work contains additional material gleaned from the diary of one of the author's companions on this treacherous journey, and it sheds some additional light on what happened, and especially on the mysterious two men who abandoned the party during the trip, and left them in a very precarious position. It's a book well worth reading for anyone interested in the Arctic, or indeed for anyone who can admire the lengths to which the human spirit and body will push itself in order to survive under the most exteme of conditions.	2004-10-04

There's a rather light-hearted approach to the subject, but it does go into detail of the lives of the women who seduced, or were seduced by, various monarchs. Interwoven in the tale is much of European history, and a lot of diplomacy which was occasionally (mis)managed by politically ambitious mistresses. The ends of mistresses varied greatly, from death in childbirth, to dismissal with pensions or not, to long lives with their husbands, to early death from illness, to being murdered. The story of the Duke and Dutchess of Windsor is particularly interesting, for it puts a different slant on that affair than I had ever considered, and for that bit of information alone I consider the book well worth reading.	2004-09-30

You know you're going to enjoy it, but the taste quickly leaves you after the candy (or the book) is finished. This is \\"light reading\\", of course, and should be considered nothing else. You go into the book knowing that Dillon and his friends are going to win out in the end, even if occasionally one of them ends up injured. The bad guys are typically evil, and the kind of folks you root for to come to a bad end. It's not great literature, but a welcome break from heavier, nore meaningful works.

Anyone wishing to learn the unvarnished truth about the origin and expansion of the FBI need look no further than this book. It is an excellent, well-written work about the War on Crime initiated by the Federal Government in 1933-34 that turned the FBI from a bumbling group of college men into the professional establsihment it is today. The book doesn't gloss over the FBI's initial failures, and their attempts to cover up their mistakes, but it does show that the agents learned their trade \\"on the job\\", and ultimately triumphed, even if often their success came about by accident. We are given thorough histories for the initial \\"public enemies\\" of the '30s: Machine Gun Kelly, Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, etc.. My only quibble was that the book followed a strict time line and often that approach was confusing as it shifted back and forth among the criminals. However, I learned to keep the characters straight, and that  helped quite a bit. Anyone interested in this subject, and this period of our nation's history, will thoroughly enjoy this book.	2004-09-26

The political machinations and combinations that characterized that turbulent period in Rome's history are covered quite well, and the reader is never bogged down with extraneous detail. The story is told sparingly and without additional minutae, which makes for an easy and enjoyable read. You never feel lost in this book, and that's often important when reading about a period of time over 20 centuries ago. The author brings his people to life, and you feel as if you know them as contemporaries, not ancient folks. It's a book I highly recommend!	2004-09-19

It's a beautifully written story, with mystery, suspense, romance, and wonderful descriptive sentences abounding throughout. It's also a great compliment to the translator, whose competence makes one feel as if this book were actually written in English. The characters seem so real, and the background so factual, that it seems to be non-fiction rather than fiction. I don't want to give away any of the plot, but this is a book tha centers around books, reading and authors, and the worlds that are created and lived in by them.

That being said, I will admit that I enjoyed reading this book, as it revealed again that high ranking oficers well behind the front lines look at maps on walls and send men out to die without thinking through their \\"strategy\\". This was most likely carnage that could have been largely avoided, and was only successful due to the simple courage of the men on the front lines. Both Allied and Aixs fighters were interviewed for this book, and it's quite important to hear from these men, who are dying off every day. Their stories should not be lost to history, for both the victors and the vanquished have something important to impart to us about the horror and cruelty of war, even a \\"just war\\".	2004-08-30

This extremely well-written book gives the general reader an overview of the British Mandate in Palestine from the end of World War I until Israeli independence. I was a person with some general knowledge of this period, but reading this book has been quite informative. I'm sure that many of the statements and conclusions made by the author are causing upsetness in many readers, but, whether you agree with what he writes or not, he has laid out a lot of facts that might point to some of the reasons there is still great animosity in that region. As a person who is neither Jewish nor Arabic, I read the book merely as one who is greatly interested in history, and accepted the book as it was written. I have two Jewish partners, however, and I am lending the book to them to read, and to get their impression of it. When they have reported back to me, I intend to revisit this review with the idea of including their impressions within it.	2004-08-26

It just amazes me that the author can come up with the outlandish plots that he has, not to mention the many side characters who come and go at will. It certainly helps to have a good grounding in Literature to get some of the more obscure references (such as a land with many rabbits, where one character says Lennie likes to come on his day off). One of my favorite fictional characters makes a brief appearance in this book: J. Thaddeus Toad of Toad Hall, and that alone was worth the price of the book!

I happened upon this book purely by chance, having never heard of either it or its author. It was a good purchase, for I really did enjoy the book. The plot is a bit confusing, but it's no secret that it involves the supposed severed right hand of Rasputin, the \\"Mad Monk\\" of Imperial Russia. When it's discovered in a bank vault, a wave of unusual deaths seems to follow. The hero, a police chief, discovers other murders seemingly possibly connected to the hand, and there are various nefarious characters flitting in and out of the story. I found the premise of the book quite interesting, and since the action supposedly takes place in a (fictional) town not tremendously far from where I live, it had the special cachet of local interest. It's a good mystery, and worth reading, for a different take on the legend of Rasputin.	2004-08-22

I enjoy Christopher Moore's works; they are so strange and funny! The reason I gave this latest one only four stars is that he has set such a high standard of humor in his previous works, that I found that this one was not as funny, at least not of the laugh out loud type I had been expecting. None the less, it is a very good book, with some intersting lessons about saving the whales, and the usual odd assortment of characters that usually populate his novels. It's a fun read of a book, and I think most readers will really enjoy it, as I did!	2004-08-22

It goes through a typical Olympics, showing the religious aspects of the games, and also the various events that were held.It doesn't stint on the darker side of the games, but the approach to the book is rather light-hearted, and even with that a lot of new information is imparted to the reader. It's well worth reading, and I highly recommend it.	2004-08-22

Although I thought that I was fairly conversant concerning early British history, this excellent work taught me many more things about the various rebellions and their leaders. It reveals the history of Roman Britain and the feeling of exclusion from the life of the Empire that was the general impression of the folks who lived in that far-off from Rome province. The author skillfully details the many rebellions that began in Britain, and uses coin hoards to attempt to date many previously obscure events. The personalities are often faintly drawn, but that is the fault of the sparse historical record, and not the author's. To anyone who is interested in Britain and its relationship to the Roman Empire, I highly recommend this book.	2004-08-06

Anyone who can come up with such wacky plots, not to mention the continually offbeat characters that polulate his novels is either a genius, or an idiot savant! His latest tickled my funny bone, as all of his books do. If South Florida is really anything like the place he writes about in his novels, I'm glad I've never spent any time visiting there. Even the throwaway characters are bizarre, as for example the parents of our story's heroine, who (the parents) died in a very unusual airplane crash. We have hairy strongarm men, redneck millionaires out to cheat the government, misplaced Norwegian policemen longing for snow, and a myriad of other folks crawling off the pages of this book. Of course, we welcome the return of Mick Stranahan, who was last seen in &quot;Skin Tight&quot;, another of the author's wierd tales. I don't want to discuss the plot, because it is hilarious, but there are two captive pythons in the book, in addition to an elderly female cancer patient who turns a bad man into a somewhat good guy. Just one word of warning: if you go near the South Florida swamps, beware the Captain!!!	2004-08-01

This extremely well-written book covers the 10 days that preceeded the invasion, through the lives not only of the important political and military folks involved, but also the common people. We share the lives of paratroopers, ground troops, signal interceptors, spies, prisoners, and others, and learn about their contributions, however small, to the ultimate success of the invasion. It is writing of personal history at its best, and we do get to be informed as to what happened to these people we grew to care about after the invasion. Several of them are still alive, and they, and the multitude of others who have gone to their rest deserve our eternal gratitude for what they all did for us that glorious 6th of June, 1944.	2004-07-30

As the first book in the series, this one gives the extensive background which led up to the Nazi rise to power in Germany in 1933. I found the prior history of Germany very interesting, and was rather surprised to see that anti-semitism was not created by the Nazis, but had a long and dishonorable history since the 19th century in Germany. This book is so detailed that it is simple to find the roots of many of the Nazi party's programs in Germany's past. While we should be quite quick to condemn Hitler and his followers for what they did, the Germans as a nation should not escape censure for their past practices, and their watering of the seeds of evil which sprouted so malevolently under the Nazis. There are precise pages of information about exactly how the Nazis purged almost every aspect of German life, with little or no opposition from their countrymen. It's a chilling tale, very well told, and I am sure the remaining two volumes will continue this disgorging of important historical information.	2004-07-23

This book continues the tale of Erast Fandorin, who was a junior detective in the first novel but now, three years after experiencing a terrible tragedy, we find as a Russian diplomat on his way to Japan. There are a series of murders, both on land and aboard ship, and the presence of an officious French detective and a small list of subjects makes for interesting reading. Erast once again shows his capacity for rational thought in going to the heart of any mystery. I rather preferred the somewhat vulnerable Erast of the first story, but advancing age and tragedy certainly would change a person, so its not unbelieveable. I know there are several more Erast stories in the process of being translated from Rusian into English, and I look forward most eagerly to their publication!	2004-07-21

That doesn't appear to be the situation, as we are treated to a tour of the Princeton campus and learning more than we would care to about customs and things at that school. I would have preferred to see more of a concentration on the mystery surrounding the book, and the characters involved in that, but when the authors did concentrate on the mystery, they did an excellent job. The language used was more than first-rate, and I'm always a sucker for good descriptive writing, in which this work abounds. This certainly isn't the &quot;DaVinci Code&quot;, but it stands fairly well on its own.	2004-07-12

This always helps a new generation of readers to enjoy some writing that interested their previous generation. This book is touted as a very funny work, but I didn't think that it was all that humorous, at least to my mind. That isn't to say that I didn't enjoy the book, because I did, very much. The characters were well-drawn, and the travelogue portion of the work was first-rate. I thought of the book as more of a meditation on religion and its meaning to various people in the story, and I just loved the word pictures that the author painted on almost every page! Humor is in the mind of the beholder, and some of the book was indeed humorous; not in a laugh out loud vein, but rather in a quiet chuckling way. The work shows its age a bit, being almost 50 years old, but that doesn't make any diference in the story line. This is a good book to read, whatever your reason, and I highly recommend it.	2004-07-07

Of course, the rising in 1944 was of much more consequence to the history of Eastern Europe, even if both were tragedies. This extremely well-written book outlines the history both before, during and after the '44 rising, and the great detail shows that there was a deliberate ignoring of the plight of the Polish patriots by their Western allies, with a stalling on the part of the Soviets until the rising was crushed by the Nazis. There were many political reasons for why both East and West acted as they did in relation to Poland, but knowing that does not excuse what was done to a brave little country that had the guts to stand up to the Germans, when all about them were caving in to pressure. The Western betrayal is the same as we read in the other recent book about Polish fighters in the war \\"A Question of Honor\\", and the harsh glow of history shines on what was not done, and what might have been done. There are vignettes inserted into the book which go into more intimate detail of the many aspects of the rising, from the point of view of participants on all sides. My one quibble was that the author used nicknames and such, rather than the real Polish names of the participants. I can understand why he did that, because Polish names are not the easiest to read or pronounce, but having grown up and gone to school with my fellow second and third generation Polish friends, I can surely pronounce them, and would have liked to see them set out in full. That, of course, does not detract from the impact of this work, and the genuine admiration the author shows for Poland and its people. I am proud to be of 100% Polish descent, and books such as this only reinforce that pride!	2004-07-04

The text is only a bit over 400 pages, but the type face is large, and the paper is very thick, making it appear to be more book than it really is. I don't know where to place the blame for that, but it appears to be a marketing ploy to justify the $30 price tag, simply by bulk. That being said, I enjoyed the story line, although it really didn't advance our intrepid travellers much closer to the Dark Tower. With some judicious editing, this could have been a long chapter in the last Dark Tower book (coming out on September 21), and then Mr. King's loyal readers wouldn't have to fork over the extra money for an unnecessary book. The writing is excellent in this work, perhaps because most of it takes place in what appears to be (at least) our own world. The author takes a page from Clive Cussler in his Dirk Pitt series by inserting himself into the book, to what purpose I'm still mystified. Despite these quibbles, I devoured the book very quickly, and am anxiously awaiting September to learn about the final denouement of Roland's quest, which I have been following faithfully since the first book became available to the public.	2004-06-21

Throughout the years since then, revisionist historians have given us a different, and often darker, picture of what happened in the early colonial times. There's no quarrel from me on that score, because I feel that only a nation which is capable of confronting its past mistakes can move on to a better future. This book, about the founding of Jamestown, gives us a &quot;warts and all&quot; view of the settlement and its earliest founders, with emphasis on John Smith. The relations with the indigenous population is covered extensively, and we see a far different side of the story than I was spoonfed in grade school. Our forefathers were, to a large extent in Jamestown, only interested in extracting the supposed mineral wealth which just &quot;lay around&quot; for the taking, and they thought that the natives would have no problem with that, even as the colonists settled in their ancient territories. We get an extremely well written tale, one that doesn't stint on telling the darker side of both settlers and natives, and they both appear rather evenly matched in attitudes, although the natives were more concerned with the land, and the settlers with the gold they expected to find. This colony of Jamestown was one of the beginnings of the English settlement of North America, and as such it is very important in our national history. We should read these books that remove our early student &quot;blinders&quot;, and still appreciate what was accomplished under some extremely adverse conditions. I may not like a lot of the settlers I met in the pages of this book, but I have come to admire them, even as I admire the fortitude of the natives who confronted them on their home territoty.	2004-06-16

Thankfully, I was wrong, as I thoroughly enjoyed this work by a new author. This book takes place centuries after Brother Cadfael's time, when the British monasteries were falling into the corrupt lifestyle of the pre-Reformation Catholic Church. Of course, Henry VIII's dispute over his wished for divorce sped things along, and the new officials who arose in their master's wake were for Reform, and wished to close the monasteries, as symbols of the &quot;papist&quot; devils. Our intrepid hero goes to a large monastery on the coast to strong arm the abbott into surrendering his monastery to the crown, after his predecessor was murdered there. The plot deepens when two other murders occur, and our hero and his assistant must work diligently to discover &quot;whodunnit&quot;, from a list of several likely suspects. There are religious discussions, traces of disillusionment in some of the characters, and all in all quite an exciting tale from beginning to end. I look forward quite eagerly to further books from this author.	2004-06-13

The history of the Society of Jesus is an extremely interesting and exciting one, as is perfectly clear after reading this extremely well writen book. Unfortunately, the book is much too short, and we get a very cursory history, with a lot of mentions of things that hapened, but no explanations as to what these things were. I wish that the author would have expanded his book more, so that there would have been more detail to it. One small example is the missionary activity of Francis Xavier: it's mentioned, but we don't really find out anything about it in the book. Perhaps this is just the author's way of getting us to read more deeply into the subject, but i don't know. I learned a lot about the Jesuits in this book, but I was left with the hunger for more detailed knowledge.	2004-06-06

Some good stories are written, and some bad ones. This book belongs to the former category: a well written series of nine stories purporting to give some insight into what Holmes was doing after his &quot;death&quot; fighting Professor Moriarity. In these stories he travels throughout Asia, encountering various historically correct characters and many fictional ones, and solving several intriguing mysteries. There are beautiful women, dastardly villans, and helpful assistants, not to mention a unique travelogue of intriguing places in the Orient. The writing reminds one of Doyle, which is good, and Holmes appears to stay very close to his creator's character. I assume that there will be more stories &quot;found&quot; about Holmes by this author, and I look forward to reading them very much.	2004-05-31

It is a chilling story, and must have been a constant terror to those of Stalin's circle, who were forced to live with his mercurial temper, rages and paranoia on a daily basis. Of course, it's rather difficult to actually feel sorry for them, because most, if not all, of them were just as bad as their leader. The casual way in which multitudes of innocent men and women were sent to horrible torture and death is absoluting astonishing. This is a very well-written book and is quite thoroughly researched. Anyone interested at all in Russian history in the middle parts of the 20th century should read this book.	2004-05-27

Also, having read Stephen Ambrose's account of the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition, I assumed that I could tell if the stories of both meshed well. This book really had me laughing, and it revealed a side to Mr. Mosher's writing that I had not suspected existed. He took a historical event and inserted (deftly) two main fictional protagonists and made them appear to be actual participants in the exploration of the Louisiana Territory. Along the way we learn about the true origin of baseball, among other odd things, and grow to know that love the two offbeat characters with whom we cross uncharted country. If you enjoy a historical romp occasionally, along with a well-written story and fantastically-drawn characters, I heartily recommend this book!	2004-05-17

It's a fascinating glimpse into another type of life, and what amazed me is the avidity with which the careers of these women were followed by the majority of people of the time. In an age that didn't boast supermarket tabloids, the \\"respectable\\" newspapers ocasionally had articles about these women and their exploits. There was, to be truthful, a double standard operating here: a woman courtesan was not necessarily welcome everywhere in \\"polite society\\", but a man who dallied openly outside of his marriage vows had no such shunning problem. Have we advanced more in our supposedly \\"enlightened\\" days? I guess so, but it's not much of a gain for us, I believe. Read this book to get a feel for a style of life that's gone now, but is very interesting all the same.	2004-05-11

We get tales of the famous and the infamous, the good and the bad, the rich and the not so rich, and a myriad of supporting characters so colorful they could fill a Damon Runyan book of stories. It's not meant to be a book of mini biographies, but there are some interesting lives explored. The book also contains one of the most incisive analyses of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; I've ever read. If the author leaves you wishing for more information about some of the people you meet, that may be the book's only failing: it's too short. I could really have enjoyed reading another few hundred pages about the people and places he describes!	2004-05-06

There are the books that condemn him, and the Church by implication, for not doing more (or, in some books, anything) about the Nazi threat. There are others that state the Pope and the Church did all that it could, given the circumstances of the time. This book seems to fall somewhere in the middle, giving the reasons why more was not done, but also showing that, behind the scenes, many things were being planned that did not come to fruition. The reason for this appears to be that both Pius XI and his successor were concerned with the Concordat which had been signed by the Vatican and Nazi Germany, and they wished to avoid any action that might cause Hitler to abrogate it. While this may have made perfect sense to them, at this remove of time it appears to be rather short-sighted. It's difficult to condemn folks who acted more than 60 years ago, given what they knew of the situatuon in front of them. Hindsight is always 20-20, you know, so perhaps this book has the right approach, the middle ground necessary to allow us to see both sides of the questions before the Church leaders. It may not make them less suspect for their inaction, but it perhaps explains why they didn't do what we feel should have been done.	2004-05-03

That account takes up the first third of the book or so, and then the story begins to unfold about how Churchill and FDR, in order to placate Stalin and the Russians, slowly but surely went back on their promises to the Polish people, and in the end betrayed them into captivity by another totalitarian state, which captivity lasted almost 45 more years. It's a heartbreaking tale, extremely well told and documented, and shows the political saints of the Western Allies to have had feet of clay as regards Eastern Europe. Churchill at least suffered qualms of conscience occasionally about what he was doing to the Poles, but FDR didn't seem to give a damn! Read this book and you will be filled with the same righteous indignation I felt when going through it. Being Polish, of course, I have a vested interest in the country and the people, but it still is a book well worth reading for the other side to the story of the \\"peace\\" settlement concerning Eastern Europe.	2004-04-29

Granted, it's quite short (only 170-some pages), but it does pack great detail, a lot of it new to me. The happenings in the Fuehrerbunker are, in general, fairly well known, but this book, despite its shortness, fleshes them out, and gives great life to all of the characters within the last hiding place of the Reich. As with any good book on a historical subject, the reader will learn something new, and that is my main criteria when I read a history book. This one satisfies on that score, and intersperced with the main story are other chapters discussing Hitler's psyche and theories on war and occupying other countries. There is a sort of conclusion concerning his impact on the world, but I think we all know what that impact is, given that most of us have lived through the subsequent post-war years. All in all, this is a book well work reading, and I highly recommend it.	2004-04-22

Intersperced with the main line are many mini-biographies of major players in the action. While the work is, as a whole, fairly well-written, some of the detail becomes mindnumbing, causing the eyes of the reader to glaze over. The author takes many of the Navy and Army leaders to task for their failings, particularly Douglas MacArthur, who appears to be the chief villain in the piece. According to the author, if MacArthur had done some things differently, there might have been quite different outcomes. Hindsight is always 20-20, as we well know, but it's always interesting to see that our national heroes have their own failings also. This is by no means a &quot;perfect&quot; book, but it's worth reading to get the overview of the time period and the action that took place within it.	2004-04-20

I've always enjoyed a well-written historical detective story, and always eagerly grabbed the latest Cadfael, Falco, Gordianus and Justin deQuincy as soon as I could. It was not only the writing that interested me, but the total immersion in another time and place that was fascinating. With this new book I have found another favorite, Erast Fandorin, and now will be following his actions throughour Czarist Russia in the late 19th century. That's one of my favorite historical periods and countries, so this series of books will only add to my enjoyment and  knowledge. The main character begins the tale as a callow youth, but with great potential, and we follow him throughout the unraveling of an intricate mystery until the final, albeit tragic, conclusion. I hope that my wait for the next book in this series will not be long!	2004-04-10

The author  gives his readers quick thumbnail sketches of the principal players, and also goes into the conflict between Ceremony and Word which exercised everyone, it seems, in England at the time. As a Catholic, I tend to favor the Ceremony aspect of religion, but I deeply respect those who believe implicitly in the Word, and the Word alone. This Bible creation walked a very fine line between two competing interests, and succeeded very well. Of course, the majesty of its language can never be surpassed, and for that aspect alone the Translators should be eternally thanked by those of us who favor great literature.	2004-04-06

I've heard of Sam Johnson of course (what literary person has not), but knew really next to nothing about him, except that his biography was written by Boswell. Now this book has revealed in all its detail how that book came to be written, and it has sparked my great interest. That is the highest compliment which a reader can pay to an author, that his work has led the reader to another writing, based solely upon what the reader learned in the first book. Hats off to Mr. Sisman for a job well done!	2004-03-28

There are so many of his writing traits noticeable in this work, and that's a good thing, I might add. Ludlum was always one of my favorite authors, and I devoured his books almost at one sitting. This book is just like that, with the non-stop action and excitement, the tour of European cities and locales, and the shadowy world of agents and spies, not to mention Mr. Ludlum's fixation on secret cabals of rich corporations and high-minded men ready to do venal things to accomplish their ends. The usual cannon fodder characters were about, and I found some loose ends not quite tidyed up, but who cares! The &quot;special surprise&quot; came as no shock to me even though I'm not the kind of reader to delve into the book for answers before they are revealed. It's just that this one was left hanging out there too easily and too early, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.Initially, I was a bit lost becasue this is a sequel, of sorts, to a book that I hadn't read, and the author was very tight with clues from the prior book which might have made some initial problems disappear. All in all, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and eagerly look forward to more works from this most talented writer.	2004-03-18

These books are excellent reading, and you also receive a &quot;ground-pounder's&quot; view of the wars of that time. This isn't the elite &quot;from the command post&quot; view, but from the guys who actually did the fighting, up close and really dirty. The writing is first-rate, and the characters quite well drawn. The plots keep the reader moving swiftly, and the pages are turned with great anticipation. Just when it appears that the author may have exhausted the scenarios of the war years in his books, he gives all of his faithful readers hope for the future when he says at the end: &quot;Sharpe and Harper will march again&quot;. That is fantastic news!	2004-03-12

The author has included so many literary people, places and hints that you really have to be &quot;up&quot; on literature to get everything that's thrown at you. Of course, you don't have to be that erudite to enjoy the puns and the play on names that are encountered. There's a Mr. Schitt-Hawse therein, but also expendible characters known variously as Phodder, Kannon, Walken and Dedman. That's only the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot;, as they say. We also get very well acquainted with Miss Havisham, the Cheshire Cat, and the Red Queen, not to mention King Pellinore and the Questing Beast. A little aside about Shelley caused gales (sorry about the pun) of laughter from me. This series is quite something, and I look forward very much to following Thursday's many future (or past?) adventures.	2004-03-09

To get into the mind of an autistic person, and then to construct a credible narrative must have been unreal! Once that was done, to make a plot that held the reader's interest from beginning to end, and then to keep the narrative within the &quot;voice&quot; of the main character was truly awesome. This is truly &quot;a heartbreaking work of staggering genius&quot;. and should be required reading in schools, particularly writers schools. Budding authors could learn a lot from this book, and readers everywhere would be grateful.	2004-03-05

He lays all the parts out in front of himself, and then slowly but surely constructs the finished product, in which all of the disparate wheels and springs and dials fit together precisely. This plot works the same way. Initially, what appears to be a murder investigation develops into something much, much more, and all of the apparantly disconnected bits of information the author strews throughout the book slowly, ever so slowly, come together into a unique creation. All of the questions are answered, and all the threads are tied together, perhaps not always neatly, but when has life ever been neat and tidy? It's thrilling to watch a master plotter at work, and this book fulfills that ideal.	2004-03-01

This well-written book fills in the gaps in my knowledge very well, even though it is more oriented toward the reaction of Americans and their government to what happened. This was pure out and out genocide, and the world stood by and did absolutely nothing. Granted, the world was a larger place back then, but big power politics played a great part in the reluctance of many governments to interfere in this slaughter. The book is not only a harsh indictment of the Turkish government, but also of those other governments that stood by and did nothing. They are, in some measure, as culpable as the actual perpetrators of the crimes. We see in this first genocide the seeds of the Nazi elimination of the Jews of Europe, and we are horrified. This is a powerful book, and everyonme interested in this period of history should read it.	2004-02-23

This extremely well written novel reads like a true life adventure story. It's a tale of the murder of the Russian imperial family in 1918 in their place of exile in Siberia, told by one of the people who was present at the time. The plot ranges from revolutionary times up to the present day, and involves a deep, dark mystery: why were two of the bodies never discovered? The reader is quickly drawn into the story, and the writing is such that, even though you know the terrible fate which awaits the last Tsar and his family, you keep hoping the ending will be different. There are a few twists at the end, which brings the tale to a bittersweet conclusion. Highly entertaining and sobering reading, and I recommend it very much!	2004-02-11

This new book falls perfectly into that category: well written, historically accurate, and with a plot that keeps you turning the pages. It also has characters with whom you can become involved, and the writing is of a level that it makes you wish the actual events turn out differently, even though you know that's not going to happen. That kind of feeling only comes with a book that completely enthralls readers, as this one assuredly does. The reader does tend to learn a bit more about volcanoes than he really needs to know, but this information never interferes with the onrushing plot, and you really do care about the fate of the principal characters. It's a good read, and I highly recommend it!	2004-02-09

Roosevelt and Winston S. Churchill. The author makes the point that, were it not for this close bond between the two great leaders of the Western democracies, the entire history of World War II, and the subsequent peace, might have been quite different. The book shows the initial, desperate courting of the American president by the Prime Minister of an embattled nation, with the result that a very close, personal relationship sprang up between them. The author does not gloss over the imperfections of the men, particularly the way Roosevelt, later in the war, took to belittling Churchill in front of Stalin to impress the Russians. The Yalta Conference, while it does not occupy a lot of print pages, does show Roosevelt trying to cajole the Russians into his point of view, with the intention of getting them to confront the Japanese to save additional American casualties, which Churchill didn't appear to realize (possibly because he was not informed of this strategy by FDR), being more concerned with the preservation of the British Empire and its overseas possessions. There is the belief by the author that, had Roosevelt lived, he would have taken as strong a stand against Communism as Churchill, and his argument is fairly persuasive. All in all, this is a book well worth reading, as it casts an interesting light on a friendship that saved the world from tyranny.	2004-02-05

When you read this book by Churchill's granddaughter, you get an intimate portrait of what an entourage WSC had when he went anywhere. There were private planes or yachts, villas or really up-scale hotels provided to him gratis, and a tremendous retinue of extra people to care for him. This seemed to happen even before he became world famous, and continued until his death. I don't ever want to take away the tremendous contributions he made to the peace and security of the world, but he certainly travelled like an Oriental despot! The book details his travels all over the world, and his many trips to America, both before, during and after WWII. If only the rest of us mere mortals could live in this extravagant lifestyle! This is a side of the great man's life that one rarely comes across in the many biographies of him, but it does tend to round out the picture of his life. While there are no new and startling revelations in the book, it is written in a breezy, easy reading style, and was quite enjoyable. As a granddaughter, the author tends to overlook a lot of WSC's faults, but who can blame her? We would all do that for our own family members, given the chance.	2004-01-29

I always enjoy reading a book about American History that tells me something about a topic of which I am completely ignorant. Before reading this book, I had no knowledge about the 1838-1842 circumnavigation of the globe that this expedition conducted. The author has taken a long-forgotten journey from our country's past and brought it to the attention of a new century, and for that he should be thanked. There were many benefits garnered from this trip, such as the founding of the Smithsonian, which is quite important to our nation. The narrative of the journey, and the various personalities involved, is extremely lively and interesting, and makes for fascinating reading. Discovering the almost unlimited power which the captain of a sailing ship had over his crew is quite chilling, and very foreign to those of us who today believe in individual freedom. The writing is first rate, and it moves along quite readily. If you want to learn something new about your country, and have a good read while doing it, I highly recommend this book.	2004-01-26

This excellent, well-written thriller kept me turning the pages long after I should have been asleep, but I kept saying to myself \\"Just one more chapter!\\" It's a roller coaster thriller of corporate espionage and betrayal that's almost ripped from today's headlines, and the action just keeps you barrelling along with its protagonist. Just when you think the plot is going in a certain direction there's a curve thrown at you, and often you don't know which way is \\"up\\", but that's one of the things about this book that I liked. A reader should never become too complacent: an author must keep him or her \\"on their toes\\". Finishing the book was very satisfying, and I look forward to more novels from this author, who is new to me.	2004-01-17

This is my first O'Brian book, and after reading it, I can surely state that it will be my last! I don't get all the furor about what a great series this is, because I found that, even though I finished the book, I didn't enjoy it very much. The plot (what there was of it) moved at a snail's pace, and kept getting interrupted by naturalist lectures and other really boring asides between the characters. There was more than enough going on with nautical terms that had me scratching my head in puzzlement, and that certainly took away from the reading enjoyment. Nothing much happened in the book, and it went through several hundred pages for this nothing to finally come to an anticlimactic end. Mr. O'Brian certainly has his rabid fans, but I for one will not join them!	2004-01-12

From the time I began watching the late, great Leo McKern portray the sarcastic and bombastic barrister on PBS, and right up through reading the Rumpole stories, I have been delighted, both by the writing, and by the actors in the series. As an attorney myself, I can identify to a certain extent with Rumpole, although the American system of justice is very different from the British. There are gleasms of recognition with various of the characters in the stories, both Rompole's legal chums and the always unusual judges whom he encounters. The stories are excellent, the characters, both important and minor, extremely well-drawn, and I just can't get enough of these tales. I'm only sorry that there will be no further television Rumpoles, but I look forward eagerly to every new edition of stories. Long may they continue!	2004-01-05

The subject matter, life in occupied France, intrigued me very much, but the author's presentation left much to be desired, not to mention several errors which should have been caught by a good editor. The various topics, organized into separate chapters, occasionally overlapped and the same information was given twice. Through his concentration on a specific part of France, the author failed to give readers any &quot;big picture&quot; view of what was happening, which led to a very parochial approach, and was greatly non-informative to one who is a non-specialist reader. Also, the going was very tough, and I found myself dozing off many times when trying dutifully to slog through the morass of information provided. There's probably a very good story in this book somewhere, but I couldn't find it!	2004-01-04

I love their storied and star-crossed history, and this book gives me new insights into the baseball culture and system. It's told from the perspective of a fan who gets the &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; job to mingle with the players on his hometown team. There are tremendous locker room scenes, and the players appear to be more human than we really see them when they are just on the field. Even Roger Clemens appears likeable, which is almost amazing! A close read of the book reveals that the writer was not too thrilled with the front office Sox organization, but it's the old story that familiarity breeds contempt. This is a book all baseball fans, and those who enjoy a well written book, will love! Read it, you won't be sorry.	2003-12-30

He is the James Bond of North America, and like his British counterpart, the books about him are very lightweight, but fun to read. There's always an interesting reversal of world history or literature, this time being the &quot;real&quot; location of Troy, and the &quot;true&quot; route of Odysseus home. It's quite intriguing, and I actually found it fascinating, but it was a mere sideshow to the deadly menace of a group of latter-day female Celtic druids. The action is non-stop, and as long as you don't spend a lot of time thinking about the absurdities of the plot, you'll enjoy the book. Also, like Alfred Hitchcock in his movies, Mr. Cussler insists upon inserting himself in his books. I find it fun to wait for his appearance.	2003-12-27

This book, of course, does not focus on the land battles per se, but rather on the naval aspect of that conflict. Most reasonably educated people of my generation are fairly familiar with the continental battles on the Western and Eastern fronts, but the sea engagements are very much less well known. We were taught that the Battle of Jutland was, more or less, a British victory, and that was it out at sea, except for the U-boat attacks which eventually led to America's entry into the war on the side of the Aliies. This book goes into great detail concerning all of the sea engagements of the conflict, and gives the reasons behind what happened, both the England and in Imperial Germany. We see the internal conflict within the German high command over the use of subs at sea to attack neutral ships, and the eventual triumph of the hard-liners in that struggle, which did lead to the fall of the German Empire. We meet, once again, our friends Churchill and Jackie Fisher from the previous book, and learn the inside details of the Dardanelles and Gallippoli compaigns. This bok corrects the knowledge imbalance about the Great War battles, and is excellent reading for anyone interested in the whole story of that awful conflict.	2003-12-22

The Pony Express was a privately-run business that delivered the mail over miles and miles of trackless country, from Missouri to California, for 18 glorious months in 1860 and 1861. Soon, however, the telegraph took away its business, and it went under, quite quickly. Now all we know are the legends built up by countless dime novels and Hollywood pictures, and what we get is quite a distance from the truth. This book strives to give us what realy happened, and along the way we learn a lot about the Express, its founders, some of its riders, and then the legends that built up over the years. There are many interesting and unusual characters in this story, from Wild Bill Hickock, Buffalo Bill Cody and others, to Broncho Charlie Miller. The writing keeps our interest, and the pace of the story never flags, nor did the horses and riders of this venerable institution of so long ago.	2003-12-06

Because of the timeline, and the books lack of length, everything is really compressed, and the reader only gets the barest sense of what happened during many of these elections, particularly in the very early days. That's not actually a bad thing, for it certainly whets the appetite of the interested reader to delve further into period histories and do some research on his own. I like that in a book, for it encourages scholarship. That being said, this book is well worth reading even for the smattering of information it gives about these &quot;elections&quot;. As one who grew up in parochial schools in the '50s, and was taught by the good sisters that the election of the Pope was inspired by the Holy Spirit, this dosage of truth is quite eye opening! Power politics, family connections, money and assorted other things all contributed, at one time or another, to the outcome of an election. Nothing about hanging chads, however, which was a relief! Despite all of it, the Church has seemed to survive its different leaders, for better or worse, down through the last two centuries. Perhaps then, the nuns were right, and the Holy Spirit has been looking after all of us. Read the book, and decide for yourself!	2003-12-01

I've read all of Mr. King's works, since I chanced upon his first by accident when it was first published. The books have grown in length, and often they cry out for some editing, but this series could be twice as long, and I would have no complaints about length. It's great to get wrapped up in another type of world, and to see how many of the author's books blend into the story line of the Tower. When a new Gunslinger book comes out, I just open the cover, and go along for the ride with Roland, Eddie, Suzannah, Jake and Oy!	2003-11-29

I have always enjoyed his books, knowing full well their shortcomings, because I don't expect them to be great literature, just something to pass the time with and enjoy a good story with exotic or unusual locations. If you don't take your popular fiction seriously, you can do far worse than Ludlum. That being said, I must remark that this latest book appears to be better written than many of Ludlum's solo efforts while he was alive. It moved fairly quickly, with lots of plot twists and excitement. My one quibble was the &quot;surprise&quot; at the end, which was telegraphed so early in the book that it came as no shock at all! Otherwise, it was a good read, and these days what more can anyone ask?	2003-11-29

I remember quite fondly the movie &quot;Little Big Man&quot; with Dustin Hoffman, so when I discovered that there were further adventures of Jack Crabb I purchased this sequel. It reveals more tales of Jack's adventures with some of the Old West's most colorful characters such as Wild Bill Hickock, Buffalo Bill Cody, Chief Sitting Bull, Annie Oakley, etc.. It's a book that is never dull, and the characters, both real and invented, mesh seamlessly in the narrative. It's not the West that you might remember from the old cowboy shows on television, but it's certainly a more vibrant place, and definitely more true to life. The book only takes us up to about 1893, so I sincerely hope that ol' Jack has more tales to tell, and that we'll see them in book form shortly.	2003-11-12

I assumed that this collection, like all collections of stories, would vary in quality from indifferent to excellent. Thankfully, I was wrong, for all of the stories are top-notch examples of mystery writing at its best, including the one supposedly from 1866 or so, which is a good example of older writing. I'm pleased that Gordianus is in this book, but did miss Falco, although I did make the acquaintance of new friends of mystery whose careeers I will follow in other published works by their authors. If you, like me, enjoy mysteries set during Roman times, and can't get enough of them through novel length works, I highly recommend this wonderful collection. You will not be disappointed!	2003-11-04

Of course, in the movie the riots were just a small part of the plot, and you really didn't get the full horror of them, or the human toll they took on the City's inhabitants. This excellent book gives the reader the &quot;up close and personal&quot; view of the Draft Roits, by focusing on the lives of several people caught up in them in one way or another. The writing is profoundly moving, and every scene is poignant, particularly the ones that occur in Ireland during the Great Famine. The characters are all finely drawn, and the research that went into this book is clearly evident on every page. It's a very good way to get your American history lesson about the Riots while absorbing a very human drama of strife and tragedy. This is a book I highly recommend!	2003-10-27

From negating the Virgin birth to the real reason for the crucifixion, this book tells us the tale of a very confused individual pushed and pulled by a God with His own selfish agenda for the future. It shows a conflicted man whose entire life is an enigma leading to an ending preordained by a higher power. That being said, it is tremendously well written, with moments of high drama and low comedy. The characters are exceedingly well drawn and the story moves along very well to its tragic conclusion. It turns much of the New Testament on its ear, but does show the power and the future glory of Jesus. There may be a sceptic behind the writing, but there is religion also, and a belief in the ineffable power of God. I'm sure the author may disagree quite violently with me, but he has more faith than he is willing to admit. This book did not shake my own faith or belief, for I recognize that it is fiction, and the author's idea of what happened all that long ago in Israel. He is entitled to his opinion, and I to mine, and that's how intellectual debate lives on.	2003-10-17

Likewise his book which, although it takes place in the fictional town of Lenape, is really about Shamokin, where I have lived for the past 27 years. It is quite well written, and a great part of the fun for me was trying to decipher the people and places he disguises. Most of the places were fairly simple, and I was even able to puzzle out a few of the characters, although their fictional personas are not necessarily those of them in reality. As a lawyer, I laughed out loud at the characterization of Myron, who is a gentleman I know quite well, and who is nothing, except in honesty, like his character. Thankfully, the drug and porno problems in Lenape that fuel the plot are absent from Shamokin, but the author needed something upon which to hang his story. He is also well read, I suspect, for like John O'Hara before him, he disguises the town of Pottsville as \\"Gibbsville\\". I look forward to reading further works by this new and talented writer, and I hope they will include more stories from the Coal Regions.	2003-10-14

It is a bucolic tale of country life with the background of the preparations for Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. It's also a love story of sorts, with undertones of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. There are star-crossed lovers, feuding families, comical characters, loyal retainers, and a mysterious begging friar. It's all quite well done, and even though I'm not particularly into sing-songy rhyming verse, the attraction of the story, and it's thinly-veiled air of Polish patriotism, kept me reading on to the end. If you enjoy little-known Polish literature (at least little-known in this country) you will enjoy this book.	2003-10-10

In this one, our hero is in Wales and Shropshire, which we Brother Cadfael fans remember fondly. Once again we have a crackling good story, very well told, with sharp characters, even those who have minor parts. There are fictional and actual historical persons involved, and it's so seamlessly done that you can't really tell the difference. I look forward expectantly to the next book to learn of the further adventures of Justin de Quincy!	2003-10-09

At the time I had no idea who this person was, or why everything in the area seemed focused upon him, but after reading this book, I understand. It's pretty clear that, without Henry Flagler's vision, and money, Florida today might be an entirely different place. This man, almost singlehandedly, changed Florida from a hot, sleepy area into a mecca for tourists. His building of luxury hotels, the Florida East Coast Railway, and later the Key West Expansion, gave us our modern state. This story is extremely interesting, and I found it well-written. It tells something I did not know before, and that's always important to me when I read any non-fiction work. It's a tale of insight, struggle, ultimate success, and subsequent destruction by the forces of an all-powerful natural storm. Men such as Henry Flagler do not walk among us any longer, and perhaps we are all the poorer for that.	2003-10-03

After reading &quot;Lamb&quot;, and enjoying it tremendously, I just had to read more of his works, and I selected this one because of the wierd title, and it turned out to be a good choice. Where else can you read a plot about a disgraced pilot, a cross-dressing Filipino with a talking fruitbat, a ghostly airman who is considered a god, a cannibal, Japanese ninjas, cargo cult natives, and a pseudo-goddess. These are only some of the more unusual aspects of this writer's odd mind, and they combine into a very entertaining read. Not great literature, I grant you, but a terrific way to spend some hours chuckling to yourself, and often laughing out loud, to the consternation of those around you. Of course, with the rather ribald cover, you don't necessarily want to call attention to yourself in public, but a brown paper book cover will do nicely.	2003-10-01

Our intrepid and introspective, if somewhat stiff moralizing hero is back in his hometown of Pottsville to look into the murder of a Union general who was in Schuylkill County recruiting men for soldiers. This plot really expands to nighttime visits to a graveyard, a priest with a terrible secret, witches, and the beginnings of the Molly Maguires. Abel tramps through a lot of small coal towns and patches (Minersville, Hechschersville, Primrose) and having been in all of these places, I can attest to the veracity of his writings about them. He also walks the streets of Pottsville, and I know those streets well, and the directions and contours of the ones about which he speaks are accurate. His characters, as usual, are finely drawn, both the fictional and the historic. We see Franklin Gowen again (there is a little village not far from where I live, named Gowen City, after this man), and are introduced to Black Jack Kehoe, who was played by Sean Connery in the movie &quot;The Molly Maguires&quot;. The book is excellent, and if you haven't read any of the ones in this series, I strongly suggest you begin with the first one, and go through them in order. You won't be disappointed.	2003-09-26

The author is not of my generation, but I well remember playing variations of the same street games he describes. I found the constant profanity a bit unsettling, but perhaps that's how kids in his old neighborhood spoke, and their easy familiarity with adults was something we would never have attempted. That being said, the characters well exceedingly well-drawn, and this is the type of book that you wish would continue, so that the further lives and adventures of the characters can be followed. I can only hope that, someday in the future, there is a sequel.	2003-09-25

It seems that writing sequels to &quot;Treasure Island&quot; has become something of a cottage industry. That doesn't shock me, for any good and interesting book invites its readers to speculate about what happened to the characters after it ended. This particular sequel posits the idea that Long John Silver helped John Paul Jones obtain his commission in the newly-formed Continental Navy, and also helped the colonists to acquire the cannons needed to carry on their war against England. The naval aspects of this tale are excellent, and the characters are fairly well drawn. The plot is a bit far-fatched, but interesting all the same. My only quibble is that there's really not enough about Jim Hawkins, who only appears as a minor character. Long John himself doesn't appear to be the same fellow we remember from the original book, but it's the author's right to do with his characters as he wishes. The story is enjoyable aside from some minor lapses in plot, so it is worth reading if you enjoy pirate and adventure yarns.	2003-09-22

It appears that even the Biblical &quot;experts&quot; cannot agree on a dating for many of these items, and this author takes the position that much of the dating is based, not upon research, but upon the preconceived religious leanings of the dater. I'm just a layman, and this is all very confusing to me, because I am reading about these things purely from a historical point of view, rather than a religious or political position. There seems to be a chasm between the &quot;liberals&quot; and the &quot;conservatives&quot; in the field, with the former arguing for earlier dates which would put the documents much closer to the time of Jesus, while the latter say they were composed much later, after the Church was already fairly well organized. I don't know which group is correct, but I do enjoy a good debate, and this book certainly provides one. I look forward to reading more works on this most interesting subject.	2003-09-12

I found it very well-written, and it covered quite a bit of the history of the Nazi occupation of the Italian capital in 1943 & 1944. The emphasis was mainly on the partisan activity within the city itself, and the Allied military planning and actions take somewhat of a back seat, but it is important to note that the inside activity was extremely important to the eventual safe delivery of the city without the potential wholesale destruction that many people feared. Puis XII is shown to have attempted to steer a middle course between the occupiers and the Allies, to the point of compromising his moral authority as Pope. There were many things he could have, and probably should have, done, but he didn't, and it's difficult at this remove in time to attempot to stand in his shoes and judge his actions. In my humble opinion, he was found wanting, but that's an entirely different issue. The book is excellent, and worth reading!	2003-09-08

The latest adventure takes our intrepid hero to England, where several nasty murders appear to be hurting the Union cause with the British government. Along the way Abel Jones meets or runs into many actual historical figures, and that is part of the fun of this book, although the plot is very serious. The writing is, as usual, top-notch, although Jones' &quot;Let it bide&quot; becomes more than a tad wearisome with its almost constant repetition. If you haven't read any of these books,I suggest that you start at the beginning of the series and work your way through all of them. You won't be disappointed!	2003-09-02

That's about all that we knew, but this book fills in quite nicely the entire story of how the cable came into existence, and the persistence that it required to have the work completed. There were many disappointments, and they are well laid out in the book.Along with the story itself there are excellent thumb nail biographies of the major figures, and that's very helpful.This is a story of dogged goal pursuing in the face of many obstacles, and should serve as an inspiration to anyone who persists in seeking their dream, no matter what it may be.	2003-08-29

Take control of a mortal body for one month, and if he wishes to remain human afterwards, he will be reinstated into Heaven when his body dies. On that \\"hook\\" lies a very funny work. Of course the devil isn't seriously interested in redemption; he just wants to enjoy walking on earth and tasting its pleasures. Along the way we get some really humorous insights about what \\"actually\\" happened behind the stories we're told from the Bible.

Buying the book was an excellent idea, as I horoughly enjoyed it. I've always wondered what became of the characters in the original, and this book answers that question quite well. Jim Hawkins has grown into a fine man, and Long John Silver, a bit older and somewhat the worse for wear, is as wily as ever. We see all \\"the usual suspects\\" from the original, and there is a rollicking adventure tale included. The ending is a bit bittersweet, but quite satisfying in its way. This is a book well worth reading, and I highly recommend it!	2003-08-25

There's not a lot of description of the actual work that was involved; we are primarily given the political and diplomatic machinations that were involved in the beginning of the work, and continuing until it opened, and beyond. There are thumbnail sketches  of the major players, and they were quite interesting. There are also occasional mistakes of fact in the book, which should have been caught by a good editor. The first time Napoleon III is introduced, he's called Napoleon's son, but later in the book he is correctly identified as his nephew. Also, the date for the conquest of Constantinople is given as two different years in two different places. They didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book, but they were distracting nevertheless. Not knowing a lot about the history involved in the Suez Canal, I enjoyed this book very much.	2003-08-21

The author did not disappoint in that respect, although there was not as much information about the Thomas gospel as I had expected. Instead the reader is given a history of how the New Testament we use today came into being, and I was grateful for that, because it filled in a lot of gaps about my knowledge of this particular aspect of church history. The book is well-written and quite informative on many levels, even if the reader does not always agree with the author's conclusions, particularly about the motivation of the church leaders of the time. Ms. Pagels is an excellent writer, and has gotten me quite interested in this subject, and that is always paramount.	2003-08-18

The author takes Xenophon's &quot;Anabasis&quot; and tells the interested reader about the famed &quot;March of the Ten Thousand&quot; through the Persian Empire and the Anatolian area. It's quite an interesting work, and although at times the author puts out facts that don't really appear to be accurate, he is merely letting us know what Xenophon wrote those many centuries ago. As with all ancient Greek histories, there are extended speeches that were probably never made, but the author does explain that in his afterward, to my satisfaction. Brush up on your Greek history, and read this work.	2003-08-18

That is the premise of this work by a Nobel Literaure Prize winner from Portugal. It's an intriguing speculation, and the plot follows the travels of five people and a dog from one end of the new island to the other. At first I was a little bewildered since the dialogue is incorporated within the paragraphs, and not set out separately, but once I accommodated myself to this unusual style of writing, I got through the book very well. The writing is uniformly excellent, and the descriptive passages, of which there are many, are quite lyrical at times. There's really not much of a plot, but the writing is so good that you just move through the book at your own pace, and enjoy the tale the author tells. I intend to read more works by this gentleman, as I really like his style.	2003-08-14

That being said, however, I must confess that, the subtitle of this book notwithstanding, there is not a lot in it about the Secret Gospel of Thomas. The wide-ranging discussions in the book do make up for that, because the author covers in some detail the Gnostic Gospels found near Nag Hammadi, and that, I think, is the real point of the book. I think the subtitle should be removed, and that might end some of the controversy about this work. I alweays read non-fiction works to learn something new, and this work, to some extent, expands Ms. Pagels earlier work on the Gnostic Gospels, which I finished a week or so ago. That book gave me an interest in this subject, and I was curious to see how she explained the codification of the New Testament. I feel that was done very well, without leaning in any particular direction in her conclusions. There are other works about this turbulent period of Church history, and I intend to seek them out. That is a tribute to Ms. Pagels and her ability to stimulate intellectual interest in her readers.	2003-08-07

It's especially appropriate that this book is extremely well-written, interesting and informative. We readers are treated to a history of the rivalry between the established National League, and the upstart American League. We are given thumbnail biographies of many of the personalities of that era, both club owners and players. There is a concise recitation of the &quot;Peace Conference&quot; that effectively ended the rivalry, and we also get to review the respective seasons of the eventual Leagues champions. Each of the eight Series games is then covered out by out, but it's not boring in the least. Along the way we also learn a lot about the way some of the baseball rules we take for granted were established, including the umpire's hand signals, and the foul/strike rule. The fans played a major part in the game, particularly the Royal Rooters from Boston, whose antics would amaze today's somewhat rowdy supporters. This is a book well worth reading, not only for baseball fans, but for lovers of the unusual aspects of American history.	2003-08-04

I really think Mr. Higgins just wants to present his loyal readers with an action-packed, page-turning read every so many months, and he has accomplished that once again with this book. It's quite easy to read, and I polished it off in one sitting over about four hours. The usual group of good guys is present, with Sean Dillon given the opportunity to show what, for lack of a better term, is his &quot;soft side&quot; when he reacts to the murder of an elderly woman. There's the usual mayhem, with Dillon and Company prevailing in the end. Sure the plot is fairly predictable, the characters occasionally merely stick figures, but you don't read this type of book and expect to get &quot;War and Peace&quot;!

This book, by the same author, is an excellent introduction to the layman about the religious controversies that resulted in the formation of the New Testament as we know it today, and about some of the very real differences in religious perceptions in the early centuries A.D..  It's fascinating to realize that the early church was conflicted in many ways, and that religion and politics went hand in hand, more so than we are used to seeing in our Western culture. The author goes into the history and structure of gnostic thought, and also the formation of the church structure that is familiar to all of us today. It's an interesting thought to consider how religion might be perceived today if the gnostic theories had prevailed. I must confess that I like some of them, but all in all they are somewhat alien to modern perceptions, and might have kept the church from surviving in a hostile world. Aside from that, I believe in the free exchange of ideas, and am very happy that we have access, through the Nag Hammadi documents, to alternate forms of Christianity, and ideas about Jesus and God.

This is a really funny, funny book, and I encourage anyone with a sense of humor to read it. Despite it's off-beat subject, it's really not irreverant, but gives Jesus a real human side that is sadly missing from the Gospels. I enjoyed this book so much that I'm actively seeking other books by Mr. Moore to read, and have already purchased one. I hope it's as crazy and funny as the one I've just finished!	2003-07-25

Although I am sure that I will never personally visit many of the sites merntioned in the book, it actually amazed me about how many of them I had actually seen throughout my life! This is probably a book that will only appeal of a native of Pennsylvania, but that doesn't detract from its appeal.	2003-07-16

These stories are uniformly well-written, but they aren't very spooky, or much in the horror vein. If you enjoy a good story that's well told, I recommend this book.

After reading this book, I realize that I was very wrong! This work is extremely well written and fast-paced. We get mini biographies of numerous historical figures, plus great dollops of Italian and European history to boot. The author tells a terrific story in lucid prose, and the reader is simply fascinated with how the painting was accomplished. Even though the romantic notion of Michelangelo paining by lying on his back for years, paint dripping all over his face, is not factual, the true tale is every bit as fascinating! This is one of those niche pieces of history that is well covered by this book, and I highly recommend this work to anyone with a penchant for the offbeat in historical action.	2003-07-09

The main idea was that the Black Death in the Middle Ages decimated Western Europe, leaving the world to be divided between the Moslems and the Chinese. I expected a rather straightforward history based upon this premise, so I was rather surprised to get a very long book that dealt with the history almost as an afterthought.  The main function seemed to be concentrated on the idea of reincarnation, and various religious and philosophical concepts. There was just too much of that, and too little story to make this work consistently interesting. The last section, for example, I found entirely superfluous. That being said, the writing was  very well done, and the characterizations excellent. It's not the book it purports to be, so be warned in advance. You may like it, or you may hate it.	2003-07-01

If I'm going to eat lobster, I decided, it might be a good idea to get some understanding of how they came from the water to my plate. The book answers that question very well, in addition to revealing the tedious and difficult work life of the small time lobster fisherman. Additionally, we are given glimpses of how life is on a very small island, inhabited by a very small number of year-round residents. The writing is uniformly good, and the story moves well through chapters of just the right length for casual reading. Every reader will learn something interesting from this well-written book, and I recommend it.	2003-06-18

Having struggled through those difficult courses in high school, I resolved never to think about that type of thing again. Bill Bryson, however, is my kind of writer: erudite, and witty, with the uncanny knack of taking complicated ideas and conveying them in ways that non-technical people can uhderstand, and enjoy. This book is an excellent example of Bryson at his best, and he gave me a new appreciation of science. I only wish that the textbooks I had used in school were this interesting; I might have embarked upon an entirely different career. If you were like me, and detested science, read this book; I know that you will very quickly change your mind.	2003-06-11

The author has used Cicero's own letters, plus the many ancient sources still remaining, to tell a gripping tale of his subject's life, and the interesting and perilous times in which he lived. We get great dollops of Roman history, and mini biographies of many other important personages. Through the work, we come to admire Cicero for his uprightness, even if we criticise him for his indecision at times, and his loose talk which caused him much trouble throughout his life. This is a fascinating period of Roman history, and it's expounded well by the author. I understand that he is now working on a biography of Augustus, and I look forward to its publication.	2003-06-01

Unfortunately for the lay reader, of which I am one, there was a lot of technical writing involved, and it lost me a lot of the time, particularly when the author was speaking about dihedrals and things of that ilk. When it came to the straight history of the flight efforts, and the Wright brothers, the story really moved along, but it did bog down for me in the scientific aspects. I don't want to take anything away from the expertise of the author, which is extensive, so I do encourage folks to read this book. Just be warned about the technical aspects of it. Gloss over them, and there is still a good read.	2003-05-27

As far as I am concerned, this is the best of the entire bunch, and I read it avidly, finishing it in record time! Gordianus may be getting older, but his wits are still sharp, and his nose for murder is as strong as ever. In this book we see our hero prone to a very human weakness, but it makes him all the more interesting for his failing. As usual, the Roman background is impeccably drawn, and the characters are excellent! We are in the midst of the war between Caesar and Pompey, and all Rome trembles with the fight. Once the mystery is solved, we see Gordianus packing for a trip to Egypt, and we just know that he's going to run into Cleopatra in the next installment. I can hardly wait!!	2003-05-27

However, in addition to that story, the author has included page after page of info about the formation of the earth, the history of the East Indies, Dutch colonialism, geology, geography, plate tectonics, and a whole host of other, somewhat intersting, subjects. These additions really bog down the story, and at times tend to have the eyes glaze over while reading. As long as you can slog through the mundane parts, and read about the eruption, you will enjoy this book. If you like your nonfiction laced and larded with facts like an encyclopedia, you will also enjoy this book. Most of us fall somewhere in the middle.	2003-05-19

I have read all of his books, and uniformly enjoyed every one of them. This latest work is no exception, even though it takes him in a far different direction than his previous works. This is a moody, atmospheric thriller, which leaves the reader guessing all the way through it, and then ends with the reader gasping in shock and surprise at the ending. I don't even want to go into the plot at all, for fear that I might inadvertently leave some tip as to what is happening in the book. All that I can say is that, if you enjoy good writing, with an extremely complicated and, at times, confusing (but never untrue to the storyline) plot, with characters you will grow to identify with, you should read this book. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.	2003-05-15

It is the account of the author's life in Russia both before and after its two revolutions. As the British Consul in Moscow, the author was acquainted with all of the main historical characters in Russia's great tragedy, from Tsarist ministers, to the men behind both the first and second revolts. He paints a grim picture of the life there after Lenin took power, but he doesn't spare either himself or others when he speaks of shortcomings in polcy. His personal life also comes under scrutiny, and he is honest about his failings. There is fear when he is arrewted by the Cheka, but it all comes out well in the end. One wonders how much more detail there would have been in this book if the author had waited to write it after World War II, or even a bit later. It is a thriller that is true, and well worth reading for its historical insights into the Russia of 1914-1918!	2003-05-12

This collection then, is especially welcome since it brings together short stories from many famous authors. Like any collection, however, it contains stories that are good, and stories that are bad, and some that are a little of both. It's to the credit of the editor that he has produced this work, and I recommend it to those who enjoy reading shorter works from some of their favorite authors. Despite some of the shortcomings of this collection, I am looking forward to the next edition of this work, if only for the continuation of the last story in the collection.	2003-05-06

These intrepid warriors faced the British imperialists in defense of their homeland, and occasionally prevailed in battle. This book details the Zulu victory over the British at Isandlwana, a very black day for the Empire of Queen Victoria. The reader receives all of the reasons why the Zulus prevailed, among other reasons the astute planning of their leaders, and the almost casual dismissal of the ability of the natives on the part of the English leaders. Once the tragedy took place, there was a concerted effort by the authorities to transfer blame from the actual commander, Lord Chelmsford, to one of the &quot;colonial&quot; officers. The authors categorically refute the baseless allegations, and show us exactly how Chelmsford was derelict in his duty to his troops, while not taking anything away from the brilliance of the Zulu planning. This is an interesting book, and well worth reading for those whose interest, as mine, centers on the cololnal conquest of the indigenous peoples of Africa.	2003-04-28

It purports to be just travel by an army man at liesure, and wanting to see parts of the world. Since we are in the &quot;Great Game&quot; era, when Britain and Russia were contending for the countries around India, I have the feeling that it was more than that, and that the author's mission was somewhat akin to &quot;checking out the land&quot; in the case of an impending conflict. Anyway, it's extremely well-written, and the descriptions of both the places and the people are first rate! The author obviously had a keen eye, and I would really love to read the report he actually submitted to his superiors in London when he returned. I'm sure it's still buried deeply in their secret files.	2003-04-22

His spare prose, almost poetic at times, conveys quite quickly the murky world of intelligence operatives. We see the dark underbelly of Europe, with the furtive meetings and the casual betrayals inherent in this type of work. The characters are, as always, extremely well-drawn, even the very minor ones. Often the real plot line gets lost, but it doesn't really matter, because of the quality of the writing. The reader is hooked from the beginning, and turns page after page as quickly as possibe, to see how everything develops. There are some old friends from previous books in this one, and some locations that we've seen before, and that adds to the authentic feel of the work. I look forward quite eagerly to every Furst book, and hope that he writes and publishes them for many years to come!	2003-04-21

To enjoy this book you must accept the threads of the plotline as it unfolds, and a dilly of a one it is! Jesus Christ was but a human being, and he and Mary Magdalene were married and had a child, a female. The Jesus line, with supporting documents, were kept by a secret organization called the Priory of Sion, to be protected from a predatory Church, the Truth to be revealed at the proper time. That, in a nutshell, is the basis around which this exciting thriller is framed, and the story moves along at a breathless pace. The reader never gets to stop and catch his breath before another twist or turn happens. As long as you can accept the story line, you will enjoy this book. If you can't do that, there's no sense in reading it. I always accept the world which the author paints for me, so I did really enjoy reading this book, and I highly recommend it.	2003-04-11

His books about the Canadian Maritimes are excellent, and his writing style is just sparse enough to give the reader a heightened sense of interest in the plot. As usual with Mr. Norman, the plot itself is interesting and entangled at the same time. We have a young man caught up in adultery with the wife of his odd employer, and there are spirit photographs, mysterious and dangerous British millionaires, baptized Eskimos, and a crippling snowstorm, just to name some of what happens in this work. There is enough foreshadowing that you just feel the ominous sense of impending tragedy, though when it comes you realize that you weren't expecting it in just that way. I don't want to give away much of the plot, for it is integral to the enjoyment of the book as a whole. Just take my advice and read the book; you won't regret it!	2003-04-07

This extremely well-written book shows us that dilemma is great detail, from the end of World War I, and the peace treaties that followed. The author goes into great detail about the peace conference and the diverse personalities who attended. She also covers the various countries involved, with all of the associated ethnic problems, and the border changes. In addition, she shows how many of the conference decisions resounded down through history, even until today. There are many consequences of this peace with which we are still living, and they are explained to the reader within the pages of this book. If you want one volume that gives you just about everything you might be likely to wish to know about the Peace Treaty of 1919, this is the book to read!	2003-04-04

It was quite an undertaking, with the stated goal of outclassing the earlier Fair in Paris, France. The story goes along two tracks, one which covers the fair and its chief architect, and another which covers the career of America's first serial killer. Both tales are very interesting, but obviously the more gruesome story is the more attractive, particularly from the standpoint of the mental state of the perpetrator, and the details (what are known) of his crimes. The author does the best he can with some skimpy data on Holmes, the killer, but he covers the Fair extremely well, and even though we might want to learn even more than he presents to us, his book gives us the flavor of the times and the people involved, and shows what can be done by a city and an organization that pulls together for a common goal. This is a book well worth reading, and you will more than likely learn something new about an almost forgotten part of our collective past.	2003-03-19

The author of this book is pretty unambiguous: the fault is entirely that of the German Empire. Once he gets down to the peace treaty, he does tend to apportion blame for its ultimate failure in several directions, not the least among them the United States, for its indifference to Europe and its insistence upon being paid back every penny lent during the conflict. The book covers a lot of territory, and its broad scope tends to limit its coverage to any one particular region, which leaves the average reader wishing for more information, particularly about the fighting in Poland and the eastern portions of Europe. Also, this book is badly in need of a good proofreader, for there were many sentences which contained too many words, and then there were some that were missing words. This tended to distract the reader, and I found it extremely annoying. All in all, the work is well done, and gives some different insight into a conference that changed the course of history, unfortunately for the worst, rahter than for the better.	2003-03-11

His stories are always populated with an unusual assortment of oddball characters, and this one is no exception. We have a venal plactic surgeon, a thinly-disguised Geraldo Rivera knockoff, an overly-tall hitman with a very bad complexion, and other folks just wandering through this tale bringing their own brand of lunacy to the work. This book has some pretty gruesome ways to die, so it's not for the squeamish, but there is an underlying sense of fun about the whole thing, despite the unusual deaths. The dialogue is crisp, the action is fast-paced, and it's a great book to while away a few hours of your time in an enjoyable manner.	2003-02-24

Once again, Carl Hiaasen takes us into the odd but appealing lifestyle of Florida, and the assorted oddballs that seem to abound there, at least in his books. An over-the-hill rock star dies in a boating &quot;accident&quot; in the Bahamas, and the obituary writer for a small newspaper begins to suspect that there may be more to the story than meets the eye. That being established, we have a spaced-out rock widow, assorted &quot;hard cases&quot;, a young college intern at the newspaper, and a dead and frozen lizard, resting comfortably in a freezer on a bed of Dove bars. It's a wild ride from beginning to end, and holds the interest of the reader completely., It's not great literature, but it doesn't pretend to be; it's just good time passing reading, and worth every minute spent on it.	2003-02-18

This was a clash brtween the forces of Generals Lee and McClellan, and is considered a Union victory of sorts, because it blunted the Confederate drive into the Northern territory of that year, and led to the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation. Additionally, it ended a drift by the European powers to recognize the Southern states as an independant nation. For all of these reasons this was an extremely important fight, and the concise writing condenses everything into a work that can be easily read in only a few hours. Despite its brevity, it gives the general reader an acute sense of time and place, and puts him into the thick of things. McClellan, of course, comes out of this work as he does from most thoughtful writings as a timid general, more interested in training his men, and having them worship him, than actually committing them to a battle with the complete will to win. Constantly overestimating his enemies' strength, he was a sluggard in movement, and a critic of his political leaders, who probably took to heart his appellation as &quot;The Young Napoleon&quot;. Only when he was finally relieved from command did he show that he had a sense of loyalty to the government by refusing many requests to take his army to Washington and overthrow the government. Lee comes across as a risk taker, who would gamble his army on the perceived foibles of his opponents. He alone, it may be safe to say, kept the Southern states in the war for many extra months than they should have been, due to his intellect and grasp of tactics and his opponents' shortcomings. This is an excellent book to read on an important subject, and I highly recommend it.	2003-02-12

Using history, culture, science and medicine, the author gives a brief overview of the Middle East, and how and why coditions there are what they are, after many centuries of superiority. It's a typical scenario of the rise of a civilization that is more advanced in many ways than its neighbors, only to slowly, over time, succumb to pressures and events which reduce it to a position somewhat inferior to those it had before considered not on an equal plane with it. There is the usual search for answers to the question of &quot;why&quot; this decline and fall happened, with the scapegoating and blaming scattering in many directions. This is not an anti-Middle East book by any means, although those in the region concerned may feel that to be so. I found it a well-rounded and measured approach to a sensitive situation, and a book that should be read by anyone concnerned with the type of world in which we live today. You may not agree with all of it, or even with any of it, but it should be read.	2003-02-11

We see how a very green group of men and boys finally came together as an effective fighting force, overcoming early disasters and learning &quot;on the run&quot;, so to speak. Reading this book was a very personal experience for me, because my father was in this theater of operations from the beginning, landing with the first troops of TORCH, and going on from there until the end in Africa. In fact, the tank destroyer he was driving was demolished in the battle of Kasserine Pass, but he lived to fight on another day, and saw the war through all the way into Central Europe with Patton. The North African theater of operations is often overlooked by historians of the war, as a mere prelude to the action in Europe, but, as this book ably recounts, without the experience gained there the army might not have been as effective later in the war. Tactics were honed, experience was gained, and leadership qualities came out (or not) in the case of the higher ranks. People may have considered this series of battles a mere &quot;sideshow&quot;, but it matured the army, and enabled it to go on to its future triumphs. Read this book and see the bravery exhibited by these young people, often only weeks away from home and country, and you will be proud to be their descendants and legatees.	2003-01-23

He was the leader of a group of rebels in Turkestan, and as such was a much sought after prize for the Bolsheviks, who wanted to eliminate him and all other opponents of their regime. The story is told in such a low-key way, however, that often it becomes a mere travelogue rather than a tale of action. For all of that, the underlying terror comes through, and the danger and hardship which the author faced appears very real to the reader. In addition to the main story, this book is also full of geography, geology, zoology, botany and history. The author was certainly a well-rounded individual, in addition to being very, very brave. We don't see many heroes such as this man in our times, and it's rewarding to read that such people were more than wiling to risk everything to combat tyranny.	2003-01-14

I have read Mr. Fleming's other two published works and enjoyed them, so I was looking forward to this new book, since I have always had a fascination with explorations both to the North and South Poles. Happily, this book lived up to my high expectations, and reading it was very interesting and enlightening. Some of the stories in this book I had known from reading other works, but the author presented them very well, so I was not bored with going over something I knew. He has a light touch and it makes the reading go well and the pages turn fairly swiftly. He covers the Peary-Cook controversy quite well, without a lot of nonessential detail, and concludes (rightly, as I feel) that neither man actually made it to the Pole. This is a good book to read before a roaring fire during a snowstorm in winter, and then the reader should go outside for a few minutes into a howling wind and feel, if only for a few frozen seconds, what these hardy men must have endured for months on end. Their accomplishments must astonish us, in a much more sedentary age, and this book helps us to acknowledge their tremendous achievements.	2003-01-13

Now, however, the wacky, wonderful third book is here, and I know that the wait was worth it! I just love this series, first of all as a History major and buff, for its accuracy. Secondly., I think that the snide comments in the well-drawn panels add so much to the stories, showing folks that history, when properly presented, is not a dry and dusty subject, but can really come alive. The artistry the author displays is often quite awesome, as in his drawings of Notre Dame, Hajia Sophia, and the Byzantine icons. You couldn't ask for better anywhere. I just galloped all the way through this book, enjoying it from cover to cover. Buy this book and read history, laugh and learn!	2003-01-03

It chronicles the people involved very well, and is based upon solid research by the author into the Inquisition records meticulously kept during the lengthy interrogations of both witnesses and accused. Using these records, the author has brought to life many of the villagers, most importantly, the local curate and some of the women with whom he was involved. It's a good story, but at times the prose is a little overheated, and the emotions expressed by the characters are a bit too much to take. Also, the author has the annoying habit of telling the same incident through several different eyes, in separate chapters, with no warning, and that gets a bit jarring occasionally. On the whole, this is a very good book, and well worth reading for the insight it gives the general reader into incidents that are now largely forgotten, but which were very important to the life of the Church and its people many centuries ago.	2003-01-02

Once again we are back in the dark days of WWII when the Nazis are at the height of their conquest of Western Europe. In this tale, the location is Denmark, a place not usually the subject of wartime espionage tales. We are given the story of how the Allies were able to overcome the German advantage in early radar, and it is told with all of the old skill of this famous author. We have the intrepid hero, the conflicted Nazi-leaning policeman, the spunky female love interest, and the regular host of supporting characters that we have all come to know and love from Mr. Follett's books. It's formula writing, but it's  formula writing at its best, and the reader keeps turning the poages from beginning to end. That's all one can require from a book of this type, and the author delivers. It's great escapist entertainment, and I recommend it.	2002-12-30

This is a somewhat interesting book that I feel lost its way somewhere along the way to the conclusion. The plot was murky, although the writing is generally excellent, and the characters finely drawn. The reader tends to lose the sense of the book, and there's many times when you have no idea where the plot is heading. I had the feeling that the author was as confused at times herself, which is what made the book so unusually odd. There are too many strands of plot lying around, and they really don't tie up neatly, or even close to neatly, at the end, which is not so much a termination as a petering-out of the storyline. You get to the point where you don't really care about the characters and what happens to them, and that's deadly in any work.	2002-12-16

It's a well-written tale, with sharp characterizations and quite descriptive passages. It's a tale that the reader knows ends in sorrow and tragedy, but he keeps on with it, because of the clarity of the writing that conveys the sense of initial optimism, and then the growing knowledge, even if unspoken, that the enterprise is doiomed to failure. The narrator is a likeable young man, and we follow his progress of ups and downs closely. The key to good writing is to make the reader interested in your main antagonist, and in this aspcet the author has succeeded admirably. Read the book if for nothing else than finding out about a little known aspect of world, and Scottish, history.	2002-12-06

This very well-written book answers that question, and in addition, gives us a fine mystery to solve along with the hero. We see the condition of the city and its inhabitants, and also get a good glimpse into the Allied administration, perhaps a closer, and more searching, look than we really want to see, after all of these years. There's a mysterious death at the site of the Potsdam conference, and from that flows all of the rest of the action. There's a love story that also drives the plot, because it becomes essentially tied into the murder. Out hero displays a lot of stubbornness in the face of history, and from the view of hindsight it seems that he was one of the last of the \\"true believers\\" in the righteousness of the Allied cause. The Allied governments don't come out in this book as quite the upright folks we'd like to believe, but history has been kind to them, so we must pity him for his naivete. You'll enjoy this book, so I recommend that you read it.	2002-11-25

The sections supposedly composed by the young Ukrainian are oddly phrased, as if by a person struggling to understand English as a second language, and the first few sections with this type of writing was a struggle. Eventually, however, reading it became almost second nature, and the story flowed very well. And what a story it is! We have a history, of sorts, of a Polish/Ukrainian shtetl from the 18th to the mid-20th century, interspersed with a search by a young American writer for his family's roots, connected with the long-suppressed tale of guilt by the Ukrainian's grandfather. It, at times, seems very complicated, but it all comes together. The writing is first-rate, and it involves the reader deeply in the story. We become quite close to the characters, and care very deeply about them all, even the supposedly minor ones. There is comedy, farce, tragedy, love, sorrow and forgetting, and almost the entire gamut of human emotions. This is not an easy book to get into initially, but persistence will pay the reader great rewards.	2002-11-21

That's the hallmark of excellent writing: when you want to believe that what the author tells you is true! The book itself is just a short love letter to Mary, the Queen of Heaven, etc., who decides to take a few days for R&amp;R at the author's home. This &quot;plot&quot; just sets the stage for the author's musing about Marian apparitions throughout history, and assorted other topics. My favortie chapter in this book is the one entitled &quot;Time&quot;, which is definitely high on my list of all-time favorite book chapters (right below &quot;The Piper At The Gates of Dawn&quot; from &quot;The Wind In The Willows&quot;). There's really little or no plot or character development in this work, but that didn't appear to be the author's intention. Instead, she has given us a beautiful work on Mary, her influence on history, and a lot of discussion of other important topics, in a prose style that is captivating at its best. You leave this book inspired to somehow strive to be better than you are, and to look at the world around you in a different, more meaningful, way.	2002-11-18

There are also many other events mentioned in passing in this work, and that's what makes it a lot of fun to read. There's also a lot of word play, particularly with names (Jack Schitt is a character, and also Oswald Mandias). The plot involves the kidnapping of a fictional character from her novel, and the heroines attempt to rescue her and bring the villain to justice. I don't want to spoil either the plot or the fun of this work, so I'll just give a very strong read recommendation. I must admit that I'm looking forward to the next book in this series, which may reveal more anomalies about this odd, but endearing alternate Britain, and world.	2002-11-12

This is a classic Ludlum thriller, with all the usual elements: a hero caught in a game where the rules are unknown to him, a beautiful woman with whom he eventually bonds, an evil villain intent on taking over the work, and also the usual travelogue of many and varied scenic cities and places around the world. Ludlum's heros are always like James Bond: you know that they will eventually surmount the challenges around them and triumph, but you're with them every step of the way. So its hackneyed, but we true Ludlum fans love it! I can only hope that there are more of these works around somewhere, so that we won't have to go into \\"Ludlum Withdrawal\\"!	2002-11-11

It sounds all quite confusing, and in the hands of a writer with a lesser talent, it certainly could be. This author, however, takes firm hold of his plot, and moves it along swiftly. It's a tale that reveals the fate of &quot;gods&quot; whose followers stop believing in them. They are forgotten, but they don't just disappear. They take mundane jobs, becoming laborers, taxi drivers, grifters, petty thieves, etc.. Then new &quot;gods&quot; come along displacing them, and these new &quot;gods&quot; want the old ones to just go away. The plot is pretty straightforward, although at times it doesn't appear that way. The author always knows where he is going, and doesn't get lost along the way. The writing is of high quality, and the character development, even the relatively minor ones, is first rate. It's a book the reader will either instantly like, or hate. I liked it, and recommend it highly.	2002-11-06

Having read it, I can understand the praise. I found this work extremely well written, and the research that must have gone into making it apopear authentic is so cleverly hidden that it's unnoticeable. The author presents us with a large Dickens-like cast of disparate characters, and we become totally involved with them from the beginning. We see the highs and the lows of Victorian society, and the good and the bad in people from all strata of society. We learn a lot about customs, mores and just everyday living from reading, and we develop likes and dislikes for various characters. It's the test of a very good novel that, at the end, no matter what it's length, we wish to continue reading about the folks with which we have come to identify closely. This was that kind of work, and it's a book that is well worth reading for everyone. I highly recommend it.	2002-11-04

Only the highlights were in my mind, so I was very pleased to learn much more about this most interesting modern struggle. The author does his best in telling a very confused tale, although his habit of occasionally skipping back and forth, and some repetition, bothered me a bit. He also would give a quotation in its original language, and then fail to tell the reader what it said in translation! Unfortunatley, English is my only language, so I took umbrage at this lapse. The work itself moves fairly smoothly, introducing a vast number of people, and occasionally I got lost in all of the unfamiliar names and places, but that's my fault, and not the author's. All in all, this is a book that is well worth reading if you are interested in learning about its subject, as I was.	2002-10-24

Although I really love his works, my criticism of his last few books have to do with the extraordinary length of them; books simply crying out for an editor with an active pen. This work, however, gets into the plot and speeds right along, without all of the usual excess verbiage. Perhaps Mr. King is really serious about soon ending his active writing career, and wants to leave us with works that will be remembered for their quality, rahtrer than their quantity. This book tells a riveting tale from the viewpoint of many vioces, and tells it well. There's not a lot of what we would consider \\"plot\\", but it is mesmerizing all the same. We get many insights into the human heart and condition, and also are given a quick lesson in the ins and outs of day-to-day work by state policemen. You grow to identify with many of the characters and their idiosyncrasies, and with them experience the terror of the unknown and, in the end, the unanswered questions posed by the unusual Buick that belongs to the barracks. When I read works of this type, I hope that Mr. King changes his mind about retiring, and continues to give us many more years, and many more books.	2002-10-18

Needless to say, violence and death follow Sam like flies do a garbage truck, and sure enough, there's soon a murder mystery to be solved. It is important to Sam, for her best friend is accused of the murder, and Sam must help him. To complicate the entire situation, Sam becomes infatuated by the \\"pretty boy\\" of the title, and that certainly doesn't help her rather odd relationship with Hugo. I found the story line quite easy to follow, and even though the ending was a shocker, I did not find it incredible, given the clues scattered haphazardly along the way. Sam's amorous actions, and her reactions, were a bit more difficult to reconcile, but she is a woman with her own mind, and what she wants to have, she usually gets, even if, in the long run, it's not good for her. This is an engaging series, and I enjoy it very much.	2002-10-04

That is what I did with this book until my son, whose degree in English gives him a lot of credibility with me, highly recommended that I read it. I purchased it the next day, practically devoured it in a few days, and must confess that I loved it tremendously! This is an extremely well-written book, sly and mischievious, but also heartwarming and poignant. It's as if the author had been looking into a lot of his neighbors' windows, or seeing deeply into their hearts and souls. It's a book that's so true to life that it's almost scary in its reality. Once in a while, while I was reading and came upon a particularly cogent part that seemed so like my own family's life, I looked around to see if there were any hidden cameras in the house, with tape polayers taking down the every day dialogue. I don't often do this, but I could just imagine Peter Boyle playing the father of this clan, and that image stuck with me throughout the reading of the book. I say: ignore the hype and read the book on your own terms. It's excellent, and you will not regret it!	2002-10-02

Oh sure, I can give you the names of the Conquistadors, and rattle off the names of the &quot;freedom fighters&quot; like Bolivar, O'Higgins and such, but when it comes to detail about the revolutions South of the US, I was completely ignorant! This book has changed all of that, and I am very grateful to the author. He has presented the liberation of the southern hemisphere in a quite lucid way, with excellent writing and fantastic character sketches of all the major players. This is not dry, dusty history, but history come alive with vivid prose and descriptions. In a book that's not exceptionally long, you get a rather detailed retelling of the various wars for independence in Latin America, with emphasis on the men who fought them in a leadership role. Your interest is captrued from the beginning, and is tightly held until the end of the work. I now know much more about our neighbors to the South than I did before, and I am grateful to the author for that knowledge. This ia a book that I can highly recommend!	2002-09-26

This new book is no exception, for the language and the writing are, as usual, first rate. My one caveat is that this is an extremely slow plot, and you keep wanting to say to the author, &quot;Get on with the story!&quot;. Once he advances the plot, everything is fine. The characters are always well-drawn, even those who don't have a lot to do with the story. The writing covers a lot of literary ground, and if you're not &quot;up&quot; on writers about the sea for the last 150 years or so, you're going to feel a little lost. The plot, once it gets moving, is quite absorbing, and held my interest. I just wish the author would &quot;get to the point&quot; a bit more swiftly, which I feel he can do without sacrificing any of the good qualities which make his books so anticipated by myself, and many others of his &quot;faithful readers&quot;.	2002-09-17

Eisenhower was President all during my years in grade school, and so he was the first political figure about whom I learned. My impression always was that he was an easy-going fellow who spent more time golfing than working, and who couldn't give a straight answer to a reporter's question if his life depended upon it. After reading this masterful biography, I am ready to concede that my impression of the man was completely wrong! The Eisenhower who emerges from these pages was a man of sharp intellect, with an intense interest in history, and a person who could, when pressed, speak and write concisely and intelligently on many subjects. He had a famous smile, but it hid a volatile temper that often mastered him, rather than the other way around. From this biography, we learn that Ike just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and he was helped in his career by powerful superiors, who recognized his merits as a soldier. The author takes us through the European theater of operations very well, and explains everything clearly, without falling into the habit of many military history writers, who give troop movements, etc., in mind-numbing detail. Here we know what happened, and why it happened, without the extraneous detail that bloats a book, without adding anything to its substance. This is a new Eisenhower to me, and one with whom I can readily say I would be proud to have known. Thank you very much to this author, who has done so much to enlighten all of his readers to the man within the public front.	2002-09-10

Indeed, some of the minor characters from \\"Night Soldiers\\" show up in this work, moving the plot along. And there is a plot, unlike some of Mr. Furst's later works! Even so, the main thrust of the work seems to be the moral ambiguities involved in espionage work, and the long-term, and down the road, consequences of even the most trivial decision. The book gives an interesting theory about the early relationship between Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany, one I'd never come across before, and I found it fascinating. As always, the characters, even the mere walk-ons, are finely drawn and quite believeable. It's a moody book, but those were moody, if exciting, times. I look forward to many more works of this type from Mr. Furst.	2002-08-30

They are all uniformly excellent, and they weave many tales of the Eastern and Central European theaters of World War II, both before its beginning, and then during the war itself. This book is in the same mold, with a dark, brooding atmosphere, and the scent of betrayal behind every action. There is no way for the protagonist to tell who is trustworthy among his aquaintances and comrades, he just must move forward with what he has planned to do. There are, occasionally, love interests in these books, but they are peripheral to the main thrust of the plot, and in this book, unlike some of the others, there is a consistent plot. There are disparate threads of storyline throughout, but they all appear to come together eventually before the book ends. It's clear from these works that the Europeans of that era were much different from the American actions, and what we learn from reading these works is that there was betrayal, but much heroism, during this most tragic of human conflict. I hope that the author continues to write many more of this type of book, for I will definitely read all of them.	2002-08-21

A first-person recounting of this most devastating and tragic illness, it is nevertheless a story of hope for the future. When you have a loved one suffering from this illness, you search every aspect of it, and that includes most importantly what has been written about it, particularly by someone who has the illness. These folks know the pain and pleasure they experience, and can relate to the reaction of those around them. Unfortunately, for all of its beauty and insightfulness, this book shows what may be accomplished when a person with this illness has a life of privilege and some financial security, in addition to a job where it's possible &quot;to shut the door to the office and not see anyone for long periods of time&quot;. Dr. Jamison had access to the best care in the field, in addition to an extensive network of friends and family, and financial resources, to enable her to battle her illness, and even then she suffered greatly. What about the &quot;common people&quot;, those poor souls who don't have her advantages, but yet must soldier along day by day, getting up in the morning and working, because if the money stops, they and their family who depend upon them will be left destitute. While I admire this author for what she has accomplished, I admire much more the ordinary people who do what they must to get through every day without all of these advantages. They are the true, but unsung, heroes of this illness. What I have just said detracts in no way from the importance of this book, and I strongly recommend it as essential reading for those who suffer, or who have a loved one who suffers, from manic-depression. To try to succeed in any fight, you must truly &quot;know your enemy&quot;, and this book, while occasionally frightening, will help.	2002-08-13

You may well ask the above question, but you will never discover the answer, for there is no character, or thing, in this darkly comic masterpiece named Ferdydurke. It just appears to be some play on words, or a nonsense title to intrigue the potential reader. This book, written in Polish between the two world wars, is extremely capably translated, with a good use of slang and diminuitive terms which must have caused endless hours of trouble and frustration for the translator. It appears to be an indictment of the state of society as it existed in Poland in  the 1930's, and may appear a bit dated since must of what is excoriated by the author no longer exists. There is particular emphasis upon the type of relationship which existed between the nobility (of a sort) and the peanant and serving classes. There is a lot about the threat of modernity in the country, and a great emphasis upon infantilism and immaturity. The work takes some getting used to by the reader, but read in the context of its time it is very well done, and should be read to be appreciated for what it has to say about the human condition.	2002-08-05

The writing and character development are first rate, and the plot moves you along at a perfect pace. At times you cry, at times you laugh, and at times you do both together. Even though the underlying action that propels the book is a horrible crime, it's pushed into the background, as it were, to get to the unintended consequences of the murder, not only on the victim, but on her family and friends. Maybe I'm just an optimist, but I truly wish the author's idea of heaven were actuality. Read this book, you won't ever regret it!	2002-08-02

Of course, he has put his intrepid hero, Richard Sharpe, right into the center of it, alongside actual historical characters. It's an exciting tale, as always with the Sharpe series, although we get to see a little of the softer side of Sharpe, as he grieves for his lost Grace, who died in childbirth. Sharpe is the early 19th century James Bond, always getting into and out of near-impossible situations, and always seeming to find a beautiful woman to share some time with him. The settings appear factual, and I assume that the details of the action are quite correct. Now that this tale is told, I wonder where Sharpe's adventures will take him next, for it appears that most of the time from 1807 until Waterloo has been covered by other books in this series. I can only hope the author finds other adventures for Richard Sharpe, for I would miss him terribly if there were no further works about him.	2002-07-29

For that first chapter alone, the book is worth reading, but it is more than a battle book. Once again, the author has woven a tightly bound mystery into the Civil War era, and placed the intrepid Abel Jones right in the middle of it. This time, he goes into the Confederate lines to help find out why runaway slaves are being massacred. It's quite an exciting story, and the plot is moving forward even when you don't realize it. The writing is uniformly excellent, as usual, and all of the scenes are important, in addition to the depiction of actual historical characters. This is developing into a tremendous series, and I look forward to the next book, when I assume our hero will be overseas.	2002-07-29

This well-written book gives all of the background of that last, fatal voyage, with thumbnail biographies of many of the important personages involved, whether politicians, statesmen, military men, crew and passengers. It's a fascinating book, and even more so once the ship is struck by the torpedo and begins to sink. That's when the real tragedy happens, and that's when the writing gets fantastic. You can almost feel the fear, and the cowardice, and the heroism, and the fatalism of everyone involved. The author then relates the attempts of all of the governments involved, Britain, U.S. and Germany, to &quot;cover up&quot; or change the facts of what actually happened on the seas off the southern coast of Ireland. This is a fascinating story, well told, and well worth reading.	2002-07-25

From the author of &quot;Stalingrad&quot;, which I found also well-written, I expected no less, and he did not disappoint. As usual, there is the broad tactical sweep of the battles, with the names and numbers of units going by so quickly that sometimes the eyes glaze. Intersperced, however, are the small, personal stories of the combatants, and the civilians, on both sides. We also look in on the chaos and make-believe world of the Fuehrerbunker, with its own version of reality while the world around it was crumbling. There are many excellent books on this most devastating war, and this one deserves to rank up with the best of them.	2002-07-19

There are some parts of it, concerning various studies and statistics, which aren't really germane to what we, as family members, need to know about the illness, but the bulk of the work is tremendously helpful. We are given the symptoms of the illness, in all of its varied forms, and quite importantly, the current medications are thoroughly discussed, with all of their helps and hindrances, including side effects and interactions with other drugs. It's not an easy book to read, but I don't mean that in the comprehension sense: in that way, anyone can read and understand. It's just that manic depression is such a terrible illness, not only on the person who has it, but on all those around that person who love him or her and try to be helpful. When you read some of the small case studies, and also learn about some of the very tragic situations for those afflicted, sometime you just want to close the book and cry for awhile. However you get through this book, it's essential that you do, for it can only improve everyone's understanding of this illness, and hopefully enable the rest of us to cope with, and love unequivocally, our ill family member. More than any drug or treatment, I truly believe that love and unconditional care from us is essestial. It's not a cure, but it will help.	2002-07-12

That's what this author has done: there are two distinctly unique plots (a murder in today's Lisbon, and a tale of Nazi involvement in Portugal during WW II), and reading the book initially you try to understand their relationship to each other. It takes quite a while, but eventually, to the surprise and shock of the reader, these stories come together and produce the unusual conclusion. This book is extremely well crafted, and keeps you on the edge of your seat, continuously turning the pages to find the next clue in what's happening in both plots. Along the way you receive some little dollops of Portuguese history, a tour of parts of the country, a lesson in machismo, and some sprinkling of the usual emotions of betrayal, hatred, and revenge. This is a dark tale, with present day actions the direct result of things that happened many, many years in the past. It's different, and I highly recommend it to the discerning reader.	2002-07-10

After waiting for quite a while, I discovered the title referred to a Zydeco song sung by one of the characters, the prime suspect in a brutal rape-murder. Not being very familiar with the usual folks in the series, I can't say whether or not they are true to their character from other works. That goes also for the main protagonist. What I can say, however, is that I found the book riveting and engrossing. The writing style kept my interest, and I followed the acts of the detective narrator closely, and with sympathy many times. He seems to be \\"everyman\\", trying his best in the world while battling his own particular demons. The supporting cast of characters are very well drawn, particularly the strangely named Legion, whose pedigree is kept deliberately ambiguous. This is a strong book, and may turn off some readers, but I found it absorbing, and may have discovered another series in which to interest myself in the future.	2002-07-08

It takes historical figures such as Victoria Woodhull, Walt Whitman and others, and mixes them with fictional characters to create a plot that is extremely difficult to describe. Suffice it to say that one of the characters is intent upon building a &quot;machine&quot; that will bring back all of the dead. It sounds like pure science fiction, but the story is so well told that, even if you're not an SF fan, you won't be put off by reading it. There are large chunks of beautiful writing in this book, and some of the insights into the human condition are amazing for a young author. You just have to get beyond the odd basis of the book, and read and enjoy it for the writing and the character development. It's a worthwhile effort, believe me.	2002-07-02

As a person always interested in unusual historical events, I purchased this book, and I am very happy that I did. It is a well-written, extremely lucid account of the great Maine fire of October 1947, which really devastated that state. By the terms of our current western wildfires, which destroy millions of acres, this was small (only a bit over 200,000 acres were hit), but a lot of the destruction happened in occupied areas, when homes, businesses, churches, schools, and almost entire towns were lost. This book is at its best when it recounts the human aspect of this series of fires, and the author has collected newsprint accounts, in addition to interviewing the people involved at the time. It is a true tale of heartbreak and heroism, and it shows the resolution and sheer grit of the folks from Maine. They are wonderful people, and this book is quite a tribute to them!	2002-06-27

It was a wise decision on my part, for I enjoyed the book very much. The writing is excellent, and the plot, while a bit odd, is quite interesting. The Berrybender family, travelling in a &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, is out to see the West in 1832. These spoiled English aristocrats have no clue as to how to behave in a strange country with different ustoms, so most of them go on acting as if they are still at home, with devastating consequences at times. There are deaths, mutilations, ravishings, amputations, but through it all, the pater familias acts as if he's still on his estate, and the lord of all he surveys. This is going to be a four part saga, and I can't wait to read the next installment, which should tell you a lot about how much I liked this book!	2002-06-24

Having read it, I can say that it was enjoyable reading, but certainly not as entertaining as its predecessor. The story line about cracking the Enigma code is fairly interesting, but it's not enough to sustain the suspense in the novel. The author has invented a mystery, of sorts, but it's so well-hidden that you're almost half way or more through the book before you realize that there is another story line going on in addition to the code cracking. It's difficult to muster up enough interest in the &quot;missing&quot; blonde to keep the reader going, but the writing is crisp and that makes up for a lot of the disappointments about the book. If you want to know something about the Enigma machines and how the codebreakers helped in the war effort, read this book. If you're looking for a good mystery, this isn't the one for you.	2002-06-17

I don't need critics and reviewers to tell me what I like and don't like; I'm an independent sort. Having read this book, and having enjoyed it tremendously, I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good thriller. This first time fiction author has done a superb job of keeping the reader's interest in his plot and characters. He is so evenhanded about the various peoples' political beliefs that, at the end, I still don't know whether he is a liberal or a conservative, since both sides get some rather severe bashing here and there. Also, even though most of the characters in the book are black, once you get going into the plot race becomes completely irrelevant, which says a lot about the quality of the writing. Some folks are complaining that this book is too long. I just think that these days we are getting too lazy to read books of any length; it's the &quot;new age&quot; lifestyle many people lead. If that feeling were prevalant in the 19th century, how would the works of Dickens, Trollope, etc. have fared? Not very well, I'm afraid. Excellent writing is excellent writing, no matter what the lenght of the work, and this book kept me intensely interested from beginning to end.	2002-06-13

These swatches are the journal entries of the Mr. White of the title, a sad and strange man with a memory problem, and a penchant for taking photos of taxi dancers. When one, and then another, is murdered, he becomes the prime, and only, suspect, and the story of how the \\"justice system\\" worked in those days is quite intersting, and chilling. The other protagonist is a middle-aged widower policeman who is involved in the murder investigation, and his relationship with a 16 year old female runaway. This is a very sad story, but brilliantly told, and well worth reading. The ending really doesn't tie up some loose ends, or even resolve the crimes, although there are hints scattered throughout the book. Even those hints, however, don't actually point out \\"whodunnit\\". Read the book and decide for yourself what actually happened so long ago.	2002-06-06

We have a clandestine love affair in Rome during 1943, an illicit love affair in the near present in Rome, a kind of love affair a bit later than the second one, also in Rome, and the discovery of an ancient papyrus that just might bring the Christian religion to a crashing end. Ultimately, however, this is a book about words, and every sub-plots abounds in them; words of love, loss, hope, despair, faith and disbelief. The author manages to keep all of his balls in the air while he juggles them, although at times you wonder if he's going to be able to continue. The writing just sweeps you along, and even though the book closes fairly satisfactorily, you find yourself wishing to know even more about the characters, and their subsequent lives. That's the ultimate test of a book worth reading, and this one passes the test with flying colors!	2002-06-03

I found the characters quite interesting, and the story line kept me turning the pages at a fairly quick rate. The problem is that I really couldn't get into this book as much as I thought that I would have, after reading &quot;Atonement&quot;, this author's latest work. Actually, I think the new book is far better than this one, although each has its own fine qualities. I don't want to put off anyone interested in reading this book, however, for it will be satisfying to most readers, and a good introduction to this author, if someone has not read him before this work. Just be prepared to be mildly disappointed by a prize-winning work.	2002-05-29

This one is a very well written, short work, but it tells a compelling story about the many types of obsession that exist in life. The prose is spare, but beautiful, and the tale moves along fairly swiftly to its bittersweet and somewhat mysterious and enigmatic ending. You're caught up in the lives of the various characters, particularly the unusual young woman who changes herself into the embodiment of a figure in a Dutch painting. Along with the title character, you can tell that it's going to end up badly for her, but like him, you realize that, ultimately, there is nothing that can be done. The book may be a little depressing, but that's the story it tells, and it's one that is well worth reading, if you like good writing.	2002-05-28

This book, concerning the 1854 sinking of the steamship Arctic, is one of those books. As an added bonus, it's extremely well-written, reading almost as if it were a novel. There are a lot of nautical terms thrown about, but there is a glossary to help those, like myself, who are unfamiliar with them. We get a capsule history of the Great Race across the Atlantic between competing British and American companies, and a bit about ship design 150 years ago, when most were wooden, with side paddle wheels. The story about the collision of the Arctic with another ship, and the subsequent tragedy that happened because many crew members ignored the adage &quot;women and children first&quot; is heartbreaking. The astonishing survival of some of the folks from the ship, including the captain, is quite riveting, in large part because of the excellent writing involved. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it to others.	2002-05-14

Where did he ever get the idea for this book? Anyway, modern day vampires and their minions are certainly an interesting, if unusual, subject for a book of detecting. I must admit that, disturbing though the subject was, the crisp writing and fast-paced plot kept me reading on into the night. The final solution to the mastermind situation was somewhat less satisfying, sort of an afterthought to the whole concept of the work. The author seems to be just churning out these books at a fast pace, and not really thinking them through. Possibly too many best sellers engenders a contempt for the reader in the author's mind, and he figures they'll buy anything. Often that's too true, and we see the best seller list inhabited by mere remnants of talent from writers that were really excellent at the beginnings of their published careers, and now are just living on their reputations, and the gullibility of the reading public. How sad!	2002-05-08

My wife, however, read this book and recommended it highly to me, and I couldn't tell her no. I'm happy to have read it, for it's well written and quite interesting, from the beginning to the rather surprising ending. Now I'm not one who usually tries to figure out &quot;whodunnit&quot; as I go along, for I assume that the author will eventually reveal all. In this case, even my incipient suspicions were dashed constantly by the twists and turns of the plot, and it kept me very interested in what was happening. Luckily, there's more of the &quot;detective&quot; mode to this book than the &quot;lawyer&quot; mode, which suited me just fine. I've never practiced in the courts in Philadelphia, but just reading about it makes me very happy that I work in the rural areas. That's too fast-paced a life for me!	2002-05-02

The language used just keeps you flowing along through the story, which is absorbing in its own right. The book presents a tale of misplaced knowledge, of conclusions reached without sufficient information, and of accusations made which profoundly change the lives of everyone involved. We see guilt, sorrow, venality, heroism, in fact, almost every emotion runs through this book except the one most needed: forgiveness. The author is to be commended for the way in which he presents the events unfolding around the main characters, and the sterling use which he makes of our language, turning the commonplace into something almost profound. You will not be disappointed if you read this work. I predict a literary prize in its future.	2002-04-30

Those means merely scratched the surface of the magnificant works upon which they were based, and this book, beautifully and insightfully written, is a wonderful aide to understanding the poems in their actual context. This work shows how the poems related to &quot;real life&quot; at the time of their composition, and how &quot;reality-based&quot; they may have been. There is the agrument for whether or not there actually was a &quot;Trojan War&quot;, and if so, where was it fought. The ancient Greek era is examined in detail, and the customs and mores of various ages are discussed insofar as they relate to portions of the poems. I learned significantly more about these works than I imagined when I began the book, and now I have a heightened admiration for the person or persons known as Homer, and of course for the erudite author of this interesting work of scholarship.	2002-04-22

Granted, some of the writing is a bit old-fashioned, but not actually very noticeable. The author uses the primary sources extremely well, and gets a coherent narrative from what had to be a chaotic scene for many months. My only quibble is that he assumes that the reader is familiar with London and its environs, to the extent that he really doesn't explain exactly where locations are in relation to other places. That's because he wrote for a mainly British audience, so the fault is mine, and not his, that I'm not familiar with London. Despite its age, it is a book worth reading if you have any interest in knowing how people several centuries ago coped with a problem which they really could not understand, or control.	2002-04-18

James only wrote two books about her young female detective Cordelia Gray. That's unfortunate, because I enjoyed both of them very much, especially this one. It has all of the \\"classic\\" elements of the British murder mystery: the castle, an island, an oddly assorted company, a butler, an interesting wealthy man, assorted relatives, and a grisly murder. Cordelia must sort out everything in the end, and even though the ultiumate outcome is somewhat in doubt, there's rarely a dull moment throughout this book. You follow Ms. Gray's progress avidly, and try to keep up with what's going on around her to gather your own clues about the murder. I'll admit that I was shocked at the resolution of the mystery, and that's one of the reasons I enjoyed the book so much. If you haven't read Ms. James, start with \\"An Unsuitable Job For A Woman\\", the first Cordelia Gray mystery, and then progress to this work. You won't be disappointed!	2002-04-17

Let's be frank, however; this is not great literature. The characters are mere brush strokes, there's very little exposition, the plots are see-through, and there always tends to be a happy ending. That being said, the books are just full of non-stop excitement, to the extent that you overlook the flaws in the work. Once you start reading these books, you're hooked from beginning to end, and sometimes it's impossible to put down until you've finished reading, even if it's the wee hours of the morning, and your eyes are burning from lack of sleep! That's the highest accolade I can give a book: that it kept me up way beyond my bedtime. It'll happen to you also.	2002-04-15

(Actually, I'd really have to think long and hard about what was the funniest book I've ever read, but that's not germane to this review.) It's well-written, with the typical understated British dry wit that does have the reader, occasionally, doubling over with laughter, although most of the time I just chuckled at the writing. It's about a singularly unsuited team of mountaineers attempting to climb Rum Doodle, the world's highest peak at 40,000 and a half feet. No one member of the party seems to be actually fit to play his part in the expedition, and the leader of it seems peculiarly unaware of what is going on about him, from drunkenness to dereliction of duty, and other things. He spends his time finding out about his party members either having, or not having, a fiance. There's a guide who couldn't find his way out of a telephone booth, an interpreter who constantly enrages the porters because he can't get the local language correct, and other assorted misfits. Read the book by all means, bcause it is funny, but take with a grain of salt some of the extravagant praise heaped upon it.	2002-04-08

If you can accept that premise, you'll probably enjoy this interesting, but poorly written, book about the first American pope and his family.<br />The idea is interesting, and it's worth reading to see where the authors intend to take the title character, and the Church. It's unfortunate that the characters are so poorly drawn, to the point that some of them are like stick figures. Events happen that have no basis in reality, and characters act, and react, in ways for which the authors have not prepared the readers, so that you're left scratching your head at times. The religious feeling of the authors comes through quite clearly, but they have taken a good idea and packaged it in a poor wrapping.	2002-04-05

It's especially relevant now that the \\"Queen Mum\\" has passed away, for she was more than likely alive when Victoria died, the last connection in the British royal family to that era of pomp and circumstance. It's very interesting to see how death and services for royals were handled 100 years ago, when there were many more monarchies and the almost reverential attitude towards them had not been soured by WWI.<br />Victoria was beloved by her people, and almost all of them could not remember another reigning monarch, since she ruled for 64 years, almost a lifetime in those days. There was genuine grief and fear at her departure, and a worry at the changing world everyone would face in her absence. A few years ago I read the book \\"Farewell In Splendor\\", which covers the same sets of facts, and both of these works are well worth reading. You will learn many things you didn't know about the end of the Victorian age, and perhaps have an air of nostalgia for what appears to be a quite different, and perhaps better, past.	2002-04-01

That may seem to be a contradiction, but his later novels tend to go on to almost agonizing length, and cry out for some editing. I understand his new Dark Tower work (as yet unpublished) is 900 pages!!! Anyway, I enjoy a well-written short story occasionally, and this book is full of them. I've read a few of these stories in other places, but they are all uniformly interesting to me, some more than others, of course. It shows that King can write pithily (as Bill O'Reilly would say) when and if he wants to, and that's a sign that the old talent is still there inside of him.

As the scheming villain of countless \\"Three Musketeers\\" films, or 2. As the surprise witness at the parking ticket trial in the famous Monthy Python sketch. Both these portrayals, of course, are incorrect, and the author of this fine work has endeavored mightily to correct any wrong impressions we may have about this justly famous, but reviled, man. Levi's Richelieu was a churchman of true faith and belief who spent his life trying to consolidate the French people and sovereign into a modern nation state, and succeeded, more or less, by the time of his death. It is a fascinating read, marred only by the changing names of some of the players, and a light going over of French history that often leaves the lay reader confused as to what was happening where and by whom. It's worth finishing, though, to give insight into the mind and actions of a man who had a goal, and stayed with it in a single-minded way during his entire career in public service to his king and country.	2002-03-25

The action is almost non-stop, as is the suspense. Despite the breakneck pace of the book, the author does take the time to give us some character background for most of the folks, and that helps a lot in retaining our sympathies. He's even considerate enough to give the major Nazi figure some redeeming (at least in his own eyes) qualities, which serves to make him not the total monster we often meet in books of this type. If you want a read that will keep you turning pages from beginning to end, and one that you will enjoy, I recommend this bok.	2002-03-21

James book	I've come somewhat late to reading P.D. James, since she's been writing mysteries for about 25 years now, and I've been reading books for almost twice that amount of time. She's my father-in-law's favorite author, so I finally decided to read one of her books, and I'm very pleased that I selected this one, because it is excellent! Even though it may have been her first published book, the quality of writing is first class, and the mystery and suspense are just right! At times it was easy to discern where the author was going, but there was always some unexpected twist or turn of the plot that kept you on your toes, and reading until much later in the night than you had originally planned. Now that I've finished this book, I intend to read more of this remarkable author's works, and I expect to enjoy them as much as I have this one.	2002-03-11

It's an alternate history of the world in which Queen Elizabeth I is assassinated in 1588, and the Spanish Armada conquers England. For hundreds of years after that date, the Roman Church rules most of the world with a somewhat iron hand, keeping to a minimum the progress of science and inventions. Throughout the book you wonder about the rationale of the Church leaders for this stance, until everything (sort of) is made clear in the Coda. The writing is quite lyrical at times, and even though a reader might wish for more information about the world the author created, enough is given to enable you to understand what is happening, even if you don't quite know what's going on (if that sounds like a contradiction, it certainly is, but you have to read the book to understand what I mean). If you enjoy &quot;alternate history&quot; works, I think you will like this book very much.	2002-03-07

This book recounts one of those types of incidents, the kidnapping and removal from the island of Crete of a German general. It's a first person narrative, written contemporaneously with the action, by one of the British leaders of the raid. Told with typical British understatement, nevertheless it's possible to read between the lines and discern the true courage of the team members, and the terrible danger in which they were placed. The writing is excellent, even poetic at times, considering the conditions under which it was written. Like any diary, there is not a lot of background detail included, which sometimes leaves the reader wishing for more information, but that's the nature of this type of writing. Read it for what it is, and you come away admiring the bravery of the men, both British and Cretan, who carried out this mission. With men such as these, it's possible to see why the Allies won the War!	2002-02-25

Elmore Leonard has to be the king of weird plots and characters among authors currently writing. Who else could combine a high diver, a Native American ex-professional baseball player, Civil War reenactors, members of the Dixie Mafia, and other assorted oddballs into a coherent narrative, and make it work? It's almost impossible to relate the plot of this book, for sometime I wonder if he just wasn't making it up as he went along, and didn't know where it was going himself until it got there, but I was laughing out loud a lot of the way through this work. I found it so well written that I read it almost in one sitting, just to see where Mr. Leonard was going with some of his outrageousness! I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.	2002-02-24

This book, in fictional form, was the first part of a planned trilogy detailing how the Polish army under King Jan Sobieski rescued the Western world from the encroachment of the Turks, by relieving the siege of Vienna in 1683. Without that victory, our entire history would probably have changed. What thanks did Poland receive for this tremendous accomplishment? It was dismembered by the very countries it had saved!<br />Sienkiewicz was a fine writer, unfortunately nearly unknown in these times. This is a robust work, but there is a dominant theme of patriotism infusing his characters. Rarely is love of country shown so clearly as in this work. It is also a love story, and a well-told one at that. The book has Sienkiewicz's usual elements: star-crossed lovers, strudy and loyal heroes, hissable villans, and characters who offer welcome comic relief. The writing is a bit old fashioned at times, but the patriotic feeling with which it was written practically leaps off the page at you. This book is much shorter than Sienkiewicz's other works that I have read, but its brevity does not diminish its impact.	2002-02-22

This book gives the general reader an intimate and well-written look at the first complete traversing of the Grand Canyon. The writing style is quite breezy, and it makes reading this work easy on the reader. Using diaries and mementos from the participants, the author skillfully weaves an engrossing tale of travail and triumph. He also gives us modern prespectives on river running, to underscore just how difficult this task was, particularly for people unprepared for the hardships and difficulties they were eventually to face. Reading this book lifts the spirit about the couage of those men who braved the unknown in search of something new.	2002-02-19

This book aims to bring light to that era, and does it fairly well. I think, however, that this was not written for the casual reader, but rather for those who already possess some knowledge of the personalities and issues of the day. Often the author speaks about some person or incident as if the reader should know about this man or thing already. With no explanation given, the lay reader is at a complete loss to understand what's happening, or who's doing something. Also, the language of the work does not allow easy reading; it's more academically oriented, with many references to other historians and their works and opinions on the subject. I did learn much that I didn't know before, howver, particularly about the famous Ems telegram, and the author's opinion that it was not the overriding cause of the war that I had always believed it to be. For that alone, I thought this book worth reading.	2002-02-19

It's very interesting reading, although occasionally the author goes so deeply into minutia that my eyes glazed over and my brain threatened to shut down completely. One of the problems I had with the book, excellent though it was, is that I couldn't follow closely enough the intricacies of the British Parliamentary system. This, I realize, isn't the author's fault, but my own unfamiliality with how politics works in England. I'm sure that a British reader might have the same feeling when reading a book by an American author about Congress. When the book went into these types of discussions I just plodded along gamely, and sooner or later muddled through. I did enjoy the book, however, for Churchill was a great man, with all of his faults, which Mr. Jenkins does not hide. Perhaps the book could have been shorter, but that was his call, and so I will bow to his superior knowledge. Read it, at the very least, for Churchill's role in World War II. We have a lot to thank him for in that respect, and this book explores that role quite well. For that period of his life alone, I recommend this work.	2002-02-13

How many women, waking up handcuffed and chained to a beam in a basement, with a splitting headache, would initially pass the whole thing off as a hangover and a sexy date gone \\"slightly awry\\"? Only Sam Jones, England's favorite \\"crime girl behaving badly\\". This series is not for everyone, particularly the prudish, but for those of us who enjoy mystery, suspense, witty dialogue, and just a hint of raciness, it's quite enjoyable. Often the underlying mystery is merely a backdrop to Sam's trials and tribulations, and those of her friends and acquaintances. The stories are written with humor in mind, and should be taken that way. The main problem with Sam Jones is that, everytime she's around, bad things seem to happen, and people die. It's not her fault but, given her track record, the only fellow who would be likely to take her home to meet his mother would be Norman Bates!	2002-02-01

The author has, once again, recreated the atmosphere of a country under the governance of another power, and the lives of the everyday people in reaction to that power, some submitting helplessly, some collaborating, and some, some few, taking steps to avenge themselves on the conqueror. There are the usual, for Furst, finely drawn characterizations, and the feeling of moral ambiguity constantly present in his writings. This book only takes Jean Casson to the latter part of 1942. I certainly hope the author continues his story, possibly until the end of the occupation: I like this man, and want to know how his story continues to go on as the years, dark and dangerous, pass for him and his associates.	2002-01-28

His characters, sometime Central Europeans, sometime Frenchmen, are those caught up in the maelstrom and turbulence of the war. We see ordinary people exposed to moral ambiguities, and decisions must be made which are life-changing. There is heroism and cowardice, love and fear, and all the other panoply of emotions involved when the usual way of life is overtaken by war and violence. The characters are exceptionally finely drawn, and the writing is such that you want to finish the book at one sitting to find out how it ends. Now that this one is done, I'll be starting its sequel, for I really care about the characters.	2002-01-25

This short history of the American Expeditionary Force is extremely well done, by an author whose works I have read previously. It gives the complete history from beginning to end, and includes all of the engagements in which this army fought during its brief time in Europe. The author is meticulous in his depiction of terrain and maneuvers, and he makes a complicated, and potentially mind-numbing, subject fairly comprehensible (at least as comprehensible as possible to a non-military person). The political aspects of the war are not stinted, but they are definitely secondary to the stories of the fighting. This book is well worth reading if you have any interest at all in WWI, and the men who fought so gallantly under the stars and stripes.	2002-01-24

This book, fiction though it is, was very interesting and enlightening to me. It's based on historical characters and events, almost all of whom, and which, are unknown to contemporary American readers. In a lucid (and extremely well-translated) style, the author makes these people of long ago come radiantly alive. They appear almost contemporary in their thoughts and actions, and that makes them more real to us in this time and age. The interior thoughts of the main players gives us shivers of recognition, and the foreknowledge that we have of the tragic end of these events is even more poignant when we read of the hopes, dreams and fears of the characters. This is a masterful piece of writing, and should be read by everyone interested in good literature, especially from other countries.	2002-01-15

The author has not allowed the controversy over his biography of Ronald Reagan to adversely affect his ability to do excellent and extensive research, and then put it all together into one neat package. This is quite readable and very informative; it almost makes you feel that you are experiencing history as it is being made. Roosevelt's presidency was an exciting time in our country's history, when a lot of things were quite different, including our political institutions. In those times, the presidency was considered an inferior branch of government to the legislative side. Once Theodore took office, however, he showed that a strong and determined personality could dominate the political landscape to such a degree that he could remake the presidency into something entirely different, the most influential government branch. With some backsliding during subsequent administrations, it has remained that to this day. Much of our modern life and institutions can be traced directly back to programs that TR initiated. We have a lot for which we are to be thankful in this country, and one of the men to whom we owe this thanks is most definitely Theodore Roosevelt. Morris is giving us all a biography worthy of its subject.	2002-01-13

This is an interesting and well-written book about James Cook, the Englishman who explored so much of the Pacific and Polynesian areas of the globe. The writing is colorful, and it keeps the reader interested in the narrative line. My one problem with the work, however, is the total lack of a bibliography, and footnotes. While I don't necessarily look at all footnotes in a work, when the author discusses a person's private thoughts or feelings, I like to know that his writing is based uopon something he has read, from whatever source. Without either footnotes or bibliography I don't know where the author's lines originated, and that makes me wonder a bit about his writing and research style. Read the book to learn about Cook's life and explorations, but be cautious about accepting everything the author says, in light of his lack of providing documentation.	2002-01-03

I was fascinated by the setting: pre-WWII Berlin, and post-WWII Vienna, and the hero, a tough as nails anti-Nazi ex-policeman and private investigator. The plots are well-constructed, and the geographical knowledge on the part of the author gives a real sense of &quot;being there&quot; to the reader. In these days of troubled &quot;anti-heroes&quot; in this genre, it's a distinct pleasure to read a book of this caliber, and to see the efforts the author made to give a look of reality to his scenario.

That is the glaring fault I found in this otherwise well-done work. The author is so caught up in proving the essential &quot;evilness&quot; of IBM and its chairman, Thomas Watson, that he overreaches himself, at one point comparing IBM employees to Hitler's Brownshirts. Once he did that, he started losing me. From beginning to end there is a snide and not so subtle painting of everything IBM did as inherently evil, and condoning of the Nazi regime. If this is correct, many many companies and organizations (not to mention entire governments) from that time were complicit in the same situations. There's just too much of the &quot;evil corporation&quot; style of writing contained in this book to enable the unbiased reader make his or her own judgments about the evidence presented. When an author tries too hard to convince the reader, it tends to get my back up, and that's what happened here. He may be quite correct, for all I know, but his style just put me off.	2001-12-19

I was, therefore, very pleased that Fremont Jones decided to return to her native city to visit her ailing father in this latest installment of an excellent series of mysteries. The city itself is almost a character in the plot, and the author has done her homework quite well, for she has the geography of the streets down very well (I know, for I've walked many of them). She even stays at the Parker House, an elegant hotel in Fremont's day, and still an imposing one, where my wife and I stopped for a drink and some snacks one Saturday afternoon two months ago. The plot of the mystery is quite straight forward, and is solved expeditiously by our heroine at the end, as usual. It's a bittersweet book, for Fremont loses her beloved father, but does manage to attain justice, of a sort, at the conclusion. I await anxiously the next installment of her adventures.	2001-12-18

There's always something new to learn about ancient Rome, and the author has studied its architecture so well that you receive a virtual travelogue through its streets in every book. This is a good mystery, also, with the unusual ending that recreates the typical British mystery novel ending: the detective gets all of the suspects and witnesses in one rooom and reviews everything about the crime until the murderer is unmasked.

There is typical understated British wit and sarcasm throughout the work, and that made it even more enjoyable.

I've been a fan of Robert Ludlum's ever since the original publication of &quot;The Scarlatti Inheritance&quot;, many years ago. Sure, I know that his plots are often preposterous, the characters wooden, and the dialogue often quite stilted, but I really don't care! The man told a terrific story, one that kept me interested from beginning to end. Along the way I was given a glimpse of many interesting places in Europe (especially) and around the globe. The books were entertaining, and that's all I really ask from this genre. I either heard of read that there many be a few more Ludlum-completed works around, for publication in later years. That's some consolation to such a faithful reader as myself. If, and when, they are published, I'll read them.	2001-12-03

That does not stop him from being in the middle of the battle of Trafalgar, however. The author is to be congratulated for getting Sharpe to be present at this historic fight, and also to be able to have a few moments of private conversation with Admiral Nelson on the eve of the battle. Cornwell writes quite knowingly about ships and sailors, and his account of the fight drips with authenticity. Sharpe, as usual, overcomes great obstacles, and aquits himself bravely. There's a love sub-plot, which adds spice to the story, and just the touch of class-consciousness that Sharpe has been experiencing since he became an officer. This series goes from strength to strength, and is well worth reading.	2001-11-24

This book, by the author of &quot;Balkan Ghosts&quot;, does its best to inform us about a lot of places that aren't really very familiar to us, although they have become much more important in the past two months since September 11. This is a travelogue-political-historical guide to a vast region stretching from Hungary to Turkmenistan, covering most of the countries in between. There are incisive conversations with important folks, and just regular ones. A bit of history of each place is given, and the author does his best to fit each one into the context of the times. He makes a good case that we are so uninformed about this region that there is almost no chance of the US intervening there if further acts of ethnic violence happen, or if there are governments toppled. A lot of this book is concerned with the results of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and it is sobering to see that not all of those results were positive, especially for those people living in the area under communist domination. To be informed, fully informed, about this very important area of the world, even if you don't agree with all of the arguments  of the author, I urge you to read this book.	2001-11-19

This series, which has been ongoing for 30 years, always delights me with its wit, and also with instilling knowledge of many exotic places and events. The scholarship behind the tales is quite sound, for I have read about a lot of these incidents and what the author presents (with the exception of Flashman's participation, of course) is accurate. This latest work is a combination of three different incidents, each one different and entertaining. You know that our &quot;hero&quot; is always going to get out of the situations in which he finds himself, but the joy is in reading and discovering how he accomplishes it. May this series go on for another 30 years!	2001-11-12

He creates atmospheric works, and places his well-drawn characters into the middle of the World War II murkiness of intelligence gathering and action. His main characters tend to be introspective, moody fellows, with women to match, and a cast of finely sketched and fleshed-out minor players. We're involved in the tangled mess of central Europe during the dark days of Nazi occupation, and we seem to move effortlessly from there into Paris and the French and Belgian countryside. These books are intelligently written, and create the wish that the stories would go on long after the book is finished.	2001-11-05

The reader follows Sharpe from his beginnings in India, through the Napoleonic campaigns to Waterloo, and then in South America at the time of the former Emperor's death. All of the works are detailed, and contain enough action to suit anyone. Since this is a series, and the current works take place before the Napoleon ones, there's no suspense about Sharpe's fate, since he so obviously survives to fight on another day. That doesn't detract from the sheer joy of reading them, however, for you will learn an awful lot about the British army of the early 19th century, not to mention geography, history, and flora and fauna about all of the countries in which our intrepid hero battles. Read these books; you'll be glad you did!	2001-10-29

It might be better to call it a novel that happens to contain spies and other folks who dabble in espionage. In any event, whatever it is, this book is excellent! The setting is Europe in 1938, and the mood is somber, the motivations of many of the characters ambiguous, and the story line episodic and, a tad, confusing. Everything does come together, basically, at the end, even if the end is somewhat vague. The characters are finely drawn, even the minor ones. Reading the story gave rise to thoughts of what &quot;might have been&quot; if some of the schemes of the characters had come to a successful conclusion, but there is a knowledge by the reader that, unliike the actors in this drama, their activities will not turn out the way they had hoped. It's a melancholy work, but a masterly piece of writing. This is the first book I have read by this author, but I know for certain that it will not be the last!	2001-10-24

The reader gets an obviously well-researched history lesson in the beginnings of the Golden Age of comic book publishing, along with some sidelights into the Golem of Prague, Al Smith's position in the Empire State Building, Harry Houdini's magic acts, and many more subjects that keep the reader interested in turning the pages. I dimly remember the gruesome drawings and subject matter of the comics before the Kefauver Senate hearings, and have always had a soft spot in my heart for the superhero types in comics, so reading this book was just something that came to me naturally. How the genre began, and how the business end of the publishing industry was handled was enlightening, and the human side of the story, with our titled heroes and their assorted friends and lovers made for a &quot;good read&quot;. This is a book well worth the time it takes to read, for you will enjoy it very much!	2001-10-21

The tragedy is in the depiction of the decimation of the aborigines of Tasmania, due to neglect by the British colonial government, and the murderous outlook of the colonists, both convict and free. It's a sad, but true, story that is parallel with our own treatment of Native Americans. The comedy comes from the bunbling efforts of the crew of a smuggling ship to unload its illicit, and lucrative, cargo. Additionally, there's a deluded vicar seeking the Garden of Eden in the wilds of Tasmania, and a blackhearted doctor who believes in the primacy of the &quot;Saxon race&quot;. Everything comes together in this tale, which is well told, and extremely interesting. It's worth reading for the comedy, but you will be greatly afected by the plight of the Maoris, also.	2001-10-11

Thus, when &quot;Compromising Positions&quot; came out many years ago, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and hoped that Ms. Isaacs would pen another work with her intrepid housewife/detective. It's been a long time in coming, but it was certainly worth the wait! This new work is excellent in every respect, from a well thought-out murder mystery, to the usual comments about everything and everyone involved. I must confess that I figured out what was going on a lot sooner than our heroine, but that didn't detract me from this wonderful story. Observing her inching her way to the truth was enjoyable in every respect. I can only hope that the wait for another of these books won't be as long!	2001-10-05

Now my wish has been granted (sort of), and I have enjoyed this new book by two well-known authors of the genre. The story line is quite well done, and the characters, even the relatively minor ones, are well drawn. The plot, once it gets into gear, moves along briskly, and you get caught up in the excitement of it all. Once again, we see a connection between this book and Mr. King's Dark Tower series, and at least he keeps the plot lines consistent. My only complaint about this book (and it's a big one) is that it's just too darn wordy! An editor with some clout could have seriously reduced the size of this book without compromising the story in any way. Sometimes less is more, and that would apply to this book.	2001-10-01

You get a lot of background into the war on the &quot;home front&quot; that is usually ignored by books about this period. The protagonist, Major Abel Jones, is a well-drawn character. He is a bit priggish and highly opinionated, and spends a bit too much time mooning over his wife. but he doesn't mind admitting when he is wrong. There are a lot of historical characters thrown into this work, and I question whether they are just there for the background, for a gathering of Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony in a Methodist parsonage in a small town in New York state appears to strain credibility a little. It really doesn't matter, for the story line grabs you from the beginning, and doesn't let go until the end. War is a terrible thing, as we see from the letters of Jones' surgeon friend, serving his time with General Grant in the &quot;West&quot;. This is a series well worth reading, and I will continue to do so.	2001-09-26

After reading it, however, I must confess that the author has hit upon a unique manner of presenting his tale. Of course, this type of scenario won't work in a lot of situations, but this work concerns a hostage crisis, so the fax idea is perfect. The suspense and excitement builds throughout the book, until the somewhat unexpected climax. Once or twice I found some faxes which were not necessary to advance the story (they were, in fact, distracting), but on the whole this is a work, short as it is, well worth reading.	2001-09-24

Gordianus the Finder is a detective, like Marcus Didius Falco in his books, but Gordianus is from an earlier era, and he doesn't have the ascerbic wit of Falco. The tone of the two series is different, but the writing is uniformly excellent, and the characters stand out in your mind long after the books are finished. I do believe this latest book is the best in the series, for it combines an important point in Roman history with a human tragedy. Things aren't always what they seem in this book, and even though a few things appear simple to discern to the reader, sometimes the author slips in a surprise or two that brings you up short. My only quibble is that Gordianus is now 61, and I find it difficult to know how he is going to continue to solve mysteries. I have faith, however, that the author will find a way to allow him to go on, and when the books are published, I will certainly read them.	2001-09-21

There's just so much going on in this busy book that you don't have time to catch your breath from page to page. There are arcane brotherhoods, odd religious rites (and odder priests of them), grisly murders, dysfunctional families, illegal visits to Vestal Virgins, missing children, you name it. This is definitely the best of the Falco series, and that's saying a lot, because they are all uniformly excellent! Red herrings abound in this work, and through it all the author once again serves up great helpings of knowledge about ancient Rome that you absorb without even realizing it. If you haven't read any of these books, by all means start at the beginning and work your way through them. You definitely will not be disappointed!	2001-09-19

I've read several of these types of books, with varying degrees of interest. This last book from Gary Jennings, and another, unknown writer, is definitely one of the better collaborations. It captures extremely well the essense of Mr. Jennings' writing, so that there is a terrifice story line, and action aplenty! The background and history is given as well as can be done without diverting attention from the tale, and the knowledge inserted is, for the most part, not intrusive. I do wonder, however, what the finished product would have been like had Mr. Jennings managed to complete it all on his own. Make no mistake, though, I really liked the book, and am sorry that no others will be forthcoming from Mr. Jennings. His death is a loss to all of his fans, among which I number myself.	2001-09-17

There is a lot of poetry in the language, and the story flows well from beginning to end. The narrator, even though she is a young girl, never steps out of character, and the action and actions of everyone involved are completely believeable. This book was one I enjoyed so much, that I gave it to my wife and 23 year old daughter to read. Both of them had the same reaction to it that I did, so what you have here may be one five star review, but three people in my family have read this book and we all rate it five stars! Do yourself a favor; buy this book and read it. You will definitely not be sorry.	2001-09-11

I do think that this latest work is the best of the group. For one thing, it takes place in the Holy Land just after World War I, so we have an exotic setting. In addition, the author has definitely done her research, for everything appears to be authentic, down to the underground passages in the city. Also, there isn't a lot of deduction by Holmes in this one, rather there is just good, old fashioned investigating. The characters are all quite believeable, and the author takes no side in the incipient animosity between Arab and Jew. It's a good, rousing adventure book, and I look forward to the next in this series.	2001-09-11

It's easy to tell that a lot of the conversations in this &quot;non-fiction&quot; work never happened, for some of the sentences supposedly coming out of the mouth of the author's young brother are absolutely impossible to imagine. Interestingly, the author admits that much of this work is thoroughly overwritten and exaggerated, for whatever reason. This book is a big best seller, which makes me wonder what people see in it to compell them to purchase. I liked reading it, but I think that I probably would not have bought it  (probably because of the pretentious title) if it hadn't been as commercially successful as it has. I got it just to see what all the hoopla was about. I'm happy I bought and read it, for under all the artifice and affectation is a  real, honest &quot;heartbreaking&quot; story, even if I don't believe there is any &quot;staggering genius&quot; accompanying it.	2001-09-07

The writing is crisp, the dialogue appears authentic, and the little touches concerning everyday life give the books that perfect ring of truth that is important when writing about so long ago. If the author can't make you believe in the scenario, nothing is going to help the work to be successful. This one is, and I enjoyed it as much as I did the first book in the series. Now I will wait (as patiently as possible) for the next book in the series to appear, for I'm sure that I will enjoy it also.	2001-09-04

In addition, I have a personal interest in this book, because my father-in-law was a navigator on a B-24, and was stationed in Cerignola at the same time as George McGovern and his crew. I asked my father-in-law if he knew McGovern, but he said that he didn't, even though they (sort of) shared a nickname: McGovern's was &quot;Mac&quot;, and my father-in-law's was &quot;Lucky Mack&quot;, since his last name was Makowski, and he always was able to bring his plane home safely. Like the other men who fought in that most terrible of wars, including my own father, he doesn't talk much about it, but he is intensely proud of his contribution to the war effort. After reading this book, and the description of the B-24 itself, I have a much more heightened sense of pride at what he, and those many others, were able to do. This is another book by Ambrose about the contributions of the &quot;little men&quot;, the fighters in the lower officer ranks and the enlisted men, not the bigwigs and the headquarters types. These folks were the ones who took the awful risks, and whose courage and will to win ended the fascist tyrannies. We have much to thank them for, and these books go a long way to address that thanks. I'm happy these boks are coming out now, when we are losing these heroes at a fast rate. They are in their late 70s and older now, and there will come a day when they all will be gone. Thank them now for what they did for all of us, for a world in which we, and our children, are free of the long shadow of dictatorship and horror. Mere words are sometimes inadequate, but Ambrose finds them, and puts them between pages for all of us. Read the book, and admire, as I did, the courage of these boys (for boys they were) who made us all a better future.	2001-09-02

That's why I would never denigrate them, and I always encouraged my children to read them. One of my favorites was, of course, Superman, not only the comic, but the television series. I had a very large collection of all types of comics from the 50s and early 60s, but they were sold (except for my complete set of Classics Illustrated) several years ago, to help pay for home remodeling. I'm sorry they're gone, so when I saw this book on a bargain table at Borders, I knew that I would buy it, and I'm glad that I did. Several of the early stories were from books I had as a youngster, and even the ones with which I was not familiar were very interesting. This is a good collection to have, as there are some interesting written articles, and the stories themselves give a good chronology of Superman's evolution through the years. It's a great nostalgic work for the aging Baby Boomer!	2001-08-30

I feel that he has been rather successful in his attempt, with some minor quibbles. He covers Western Europe and the US well, but most folks know most of what he retells. He has his heroes (such as Jefferson), and his non-heroes (such as John Adams), and while I don't necessarily agree with a lot of what he says about some of these people, he has his right to his opinion. When it comes to Central and South America, Asia and Africa, he gets into giving information about which I'm not necessarily familiar, and that's where I really enjoyed reading this book: learning new things. He seems to have a fixation about slavery, for he refers to it almost constantly, but since it was a very prevalent institutiuon diring that era, he has the right to do so. All in all, this is a successful book, and it will inform the general reader about many new and different aspects of history in odd parts of the world.	2001-08-28

Then we have our intrepid hero, Dirk Pitt, the James Bond of America, come onto the scene and foil the bad guys just at the perfect time. Written this way, the books sound corny, but I really enjoy them! They are swift page-turners, and great for relaxed reading, because you know the hero will always do impossible deeds, and save the day at the end of the book. This one, however, does have a bit of a twist at the end, and I liked it. As long as Mr. Cussler writes these books about Dirk Pitt, I'll read them eagerly, and certainly enjoy them!	2001-08-27

I didn't know much at all about Shanghai, except for its lurid reputation, and I decided that buying this book would inform me about something new. It's a good purchase, for the author has a very interesting tale to tell, and she tells it very well. The book gives the city's history from 1842, during the Opium Wars, until 1949, when it fell to the Red Army. Between these dates a lot of amazing things happened in the city, and they are well-recounted in this book, both the highs and the lows. At times the profusion, and confusion, of Chinese names can cause the eyes to glaze over, but that's not the author's fault. If you like to learn something new every time you read a book on history, buy this one and you will not be disappointed.	2001-08-13

It is written in such an easily read style that, at times, it reads like a novel. It's quite linear, and so all of the many convolutions of this distant and confusing conflict appear to be made clear. Where there are contadictions in the historical record the author notes them, and then gives his best idea of what he feels is correct. I found the work very interesting, and learned quite a bit about this period of<br />Roman history that I had never known before reading this work. That is a high compliment to the author.	2001-08-06

Bruce Lincoln, one of my favorite writers of history. His works on Russia have given me, time and again, new insight into that country, its people and history. This last work is another excellent example of his writing, marred only by what I think is some poor editing. I don't know at what stage of this work Mr. Lincoln died, but it appears that, if he had survived through the final editing stage this book would have been in a different form. There are more than a few redundancies, which should have been picked up by an alert editor, and I'm sure would have been by the author if he had been around to do so. That criticism aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this work, once again learning many new things about the Russian psyche, as brought forth through the history of St. Petersburg. There may be a bit too much about architecture in this work, but I consider it a &quot;work in progress&quot; that will now, unfortunately, never get into the final shape its author intended. It's a loss for all of us.	2001-07-30

The author explains this by saying that's the way it is in the restaurant business, and I have no reason to think otherwise. I'm not a prude, you understand, but a little less bad language might have made for a higher ranking, in my opinion. In any event, this is a very interesting work to read, and occasionally I would think about the restaurants in which I have eaten (my wife and I have reservations at the CIA in Hyde Park next month)and wonder if I ever want to go into another one after finishing the work. Of course I will, because I do so like good food prepared well, and the author obviously loves his work, and loves to prepare it for others to enjoy. That's what's important, and it shines through on almost every page of the book. There are some excellent tips for restaurant customers to observe, and I definitely intend to follow them in the future. For the tips alone, the book was worth reading.	2001-07-22

In fact, their works &quot;humanize&quot; the great figrues of America's past, beginning with the three book series on the Civil War, the one book on the Mexican War, and now this first book, of two, on the Revolution. We get to peer inside the minds of some of our Founding Fathers, and their British adversaries, and all of these folks appear to be more like us rather than stiff figures read about in dusty history books. I like this type of writing, and as long as it stays as true as possible to the historical record, which it appears to be doing, I will continue to read these works. I hope Jeff Shaara does not run out of American history epochs about which to write, because he is doing all of us a favor in bringing these folks to life. We need lving, breathing people to admire, not icons who seem to be inaccessible.	2001-07-19

The action about which this book is concerned is one of those events. When it happened, it was considered something extremely heroic, and it was assumed that the story would become an essential element of our history. It didn't, of course, overshadowed by the battle of Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and the dropping of the A bomb. That neglect does not mean that what happened is any less heroic or amazing because we have forgotten about it. This story shows the courage of both the POWs from Bataan, and their Ranger rescuers (both American and Filipino) as the real, unsung heroes that they were in actuality. It's a fascinating book to read, and the true courage and fortitude of all the men detailed within it is astonishing. We have so much to thank these unselfish folks for, particularly the freedom which we enjoy today, and I often wonder if our generation would be &quot;up&quot; to the sacrifices that they made during the years of war. We cannot honor them enough, and this book is just another way of doing that honoring. Read it, and learn of the actions of brave people whom we can only admire, and emulate by that admiration.	2001-07-15

This is a well-written book that takes us through that exciting year, and along the way gives us a lot of history about John Quincy Adams and the contested election of 1824. We get mini biographies of many famous people, such as Adams, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, and the like, but also people who may have been fairly well-known at that time, but now are not even remotely familiar to us. It was these &quot;unknowns&quot; that impressed me the most, and whom I found fascinating. It's always good to read a historical work that tells me something that I did not know before, and this work delivers that aspect very well. It rounds off my recent reading of the life of John Adams, and tells me how his son fared as President and beyond. This is a book well worth the time to read, and I recommend it.	2001-07-11

I am very happy to say that has not happened with Mr. Bahr. His new book is as good as, and in some ways better than, &quot;The Black Flower&quot;. The era is still the same, the Civil War, but now we are back in Cumberland, Mississippi, the home of Bushrod Carter, the protagonist of the first work. There is some mention of characters from the first book in the second, and that gives the story line some type of continuity. What we have again is the beauty and power of the language used by Mr. Bahr, which keeps you reading, and wanting to read, as much as possible, just to retain everything involved. He has created characters about whom you grow to care deeply, and even the &quot;evil&quot; ones show redeeming qualities. This is an extraordinary work, with a somewhat surprising, though not totally unexpected (if you've been paying attention as you read) ending, and it is quite poignant. I highly recommend this work, and I look forward to Mr. Bahr's next fiction outing.	2001-07-04

This short work fills some of that knowledge gap, and it's crammed full of wonderful photographs taken by the female author's mother while she lived in the islands in 1941 and 1942. There is nothing like a photo to add realism to a text, and both aspects of this work complement each other. There is a lot of text that gives an overview of what happened on the islands directly after the attack, and how life changed for the residents. The bonus is that we are also given a first person account of that life by Carroll Jones, the daughter of the taker of those excellent photos. This is the type of book you will want to savor over the years, and the photos will keep it ever new in your mind and memory.	2001-07-04

Wisely, I put off reading it until I returned from my week at the Jersey shore, the site of the shark attacks outlined inside. Many of these places are familiar to me, and it gave me goose bumps to read about how frequently sharks come close to bathers along our coasts. I don't remember seeing a shark in Jersey for the past 15 years or so, and that one was rather distant from shore, but the terror still remains, since I was in the water at the time, and hustled back to shore at the call of the lifeguard. The author does a very credible job at evoking a vanished time and place in our history, and I salute him for that. There is a bit of overwriting in this work, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but it's a very good book, in my opinion, and it told me something about our history that I hadn't known. For that alone I wish to commend the author.	2001-07-02

I'm very pleased to note that Mr. Bahr has not fallen into that category. This work is every bit as good as, and in some ways better than, his first, &quot;The Black Flower&quot;. Once again we have the scene of the Civil War era, and there are even some mentions of characters from the first work in the second. What strikes me, once again, is the powerful imagery and language used throught this book. The author has created characters about whom I came to care deeply, and even the &quot;evil&quot; ones caught my attention, and evoked sympathy, in some cases. The author has captured a time and place very well, and I look forward to more works from him in the future.	2001-06-29

This author has combined both aspects of war, and created a unique perspective. The language is almost poetic at times, and reminds me of &quot;Flanders&quot;, a novel about WWI I also enjoyed tremendously. There are a lot of gushing words on the book cover and back comparing the author to Faulkner, Hemingway, et al.. I don't know about that, but I do know that this book is one I will remember for a long time, for the power of the writing alone. It's a somewhat sad, but ultimately triumphant tale, and one well worth reading. I've begun the author's next work &quot;The Year of Jubilo&quot;, also about the Civil War, and I'm anxious to see if he has kept to his excellence of presentation. There will be a report of that one in several days.	2001-06-24

It's not the fault of the author, it's just that he's constrained by the facts of what happened. This author has taken an event about which a lot is known, and added his own unique take on the historical people involved. He has created fictional folks also, and used them as the &quot;hook&quot; upon which to hang the story line. I enjoyed his characterization of David Crockett, a much different person from the one portrayed by Fess Parker, coonskin cap and all. You can really get involved in this story, and even though you know how it will end, the author involves you in his tale so much that you keep hoping everything will be different. That's the mark of great writing.	2001-06-24

Reading a book by a previously unpublished author is a bit like &quot;buying a pig in a poke&quot;; you never know what you are getting. I can still remember the thrill I felt almost 30 years ago when I first found and read the initial book by a then-unknown Stephen King. That's what keeps me experimenting with new writers, hoping the magic will strike once more. This is not a particularly bad book, but the writing isn't particularly good, and the dialogue is often quite stilted. The plot is very interesting, although there are what I felt to be some silly aspects to it. These gentlemen may have a future as writers, and I will definitely give them another chance.	2001-06-15

The author wears her research very lightly, and you learn a tremendous amount about life in the first century A.D. without even realizing it. Falco's adventures have taken him to various parts of Vespasian's empire, and everywhere he goes the scenes are written so realistically that it's hard to believe these places no longer exist. You consistently wonder how the author can make these long vanished cities and sites appear so realistic and, almost, contemporary. This is a great book to read on the beach, or any other place, for that matter.	2001-06-13

Bruce Lincoln and a few others. It's no shock, then, that I thoroughly enjoyed this biography of our little-understood and generally maligned second president. His rehabilitation has long been overdue, and Mr.  McCullough accomplishes that without diminishing the reputation of Thomas Jefferson. There is a lot in this book that I found new and fascinating, and the author's style made the reading quite easy. I strongly recommend this work to anyone interested in the founding, and the early government, of our country.	2001-06-07

I was immediately pulled into the narrative, and even though I knew how the book would end, I was mesmerized by the language and structure of the work. It covers a lot of familiar territory, but gives a new twist to many of the decisions made in the fateful month of the book's title. When you think about it, just one or two different decisions by key persons, and the entire history of our country could have been different. According to this book we have a lot to thank Robert E. Lee for in his last decisions of the war, and a few other Confederate leaders. If you don't know to what I am referring, I strongly recommend this book to you.	2001-05-29

There is a great reliance upon the Goebbels diaries, and also post-war memoirs of others in the Nazi regime. I found the book well-written, although there were too many instances of an English word or phrase followed by its German equivalent, an affectation I could have done without. Also, the author was enamored of certain phrases, such as &quot;pushing on an open door&quot;, which he used, in my opinion, excessively. On the whole, however, this is a book well worth reading, for it gives the reader the view of the War from the German perspective, and helps to explain a lot of what Hitler did, or was blamed for doing. Make no mistake, Kershaw places responsibility for basically everything that happened in Germany squarely at Hitler's doorstep, either directly or by implication. That's where it belongs, obviously. Read the book, you'll learn more than you may want to know about this embodiment of ultimate evil, but only by understanding this type of person will we be able to successfully confront someone similar in the future.	2001-05-22

Actually, it's a very good book, although it tends to be overwritten in places and there are one or two incorrect dates. It gives a concise history of Mexico in the early part of the 19th century leading up to the Texas War for Independence, and what followed. Everything is presented quite clearly, and you can understand how things happened, and why they happened. The actual Alamo seige and battle pass fairly quickly, because that's how it was in reality. I found the later history extremely interesting, and combining LBJ's father, Walt Disney, John Wayne, and numerous others in the story was an excellent decision on the part of the authors. I'm of the generation raised on Davy Crockett, and my friends and I recreated the Alamo battle countless times on the cinderblock wall in my back yard, each of us taking turns as Davy. If nothing else, Disney's film of Crockett's life awakened in me the idea of history as something interesting, and worth studying. I've done that ever since, and the authors show that the Alamo is ingrained in our national consciousness because of Uncle Walt primarily, and also John Wayne's movie, which I vividly remember seeing as a young teenager. To those of a new generation, who don't have those memories of the Alamo films, this book is well worth reading, and I highly recommend it.	2001-05-03

Reading this work reveals a fascinating, and little-known, tale of the beginnings of the Revolution. It reminds me of the scene in &quot;The Wizard of OZ&quot; where Dorothy and her friends are ushered into the presence of the Great and Powerful OZ. Smoke pours out, lights flash, loud voices are heard, but everything is manufactured by &quot;the man behind the curtain&quot;. This appears to be the theme of this book, that Samuel Adams and a few others, by deft maneuvering, and some incredibly stupid moves by the British authorities, created the Revolution out of whole cloth. The facts are presented quite plainly, and while all readers may not accept the premise of the author, I must admit that he has made a very good case. The book is well-written, and worth reading, if only to learn a lot about how the Revolution began, facts that aren't the common inserts in school history textbooks.	2001-04-25

It follows the same basic formula as the original book by the author's father, and the author's own two previous works on the Civil War: chapters about each character, and then a final wrap-up at the end, telling us about each person's future career. It works as a novel, so why tamper with success? The book is well-written, even though there appears to be more internal thought from each person than is really necessary. The author attempts to stay as close to the historical record as possible, and I give him high marks for that. My only thought is that, now he's done the Civil War and the Mexican War with these characters, where does he go? I hope to have a response in the bookstores from him, and I will be sure to read it.	2001-04-19

Naturally, murder, mystery and mayhem follow her. I thoroughly enjoy these books, because the author has created a thoroughly modern heroine who does outrageous things, and makes no apologies whatsoever for her actions. Often the mystery is secondary to the characterizations and the verbal byplay, but that's fine with me. Strong female characters are still a bit unusual in fiction today, particularly in this type of work (with the exception of Dennis Lehane's PI series)and I for one am happy to see Sam Jones continue her career for many, many more years.	2001-04-12

All of his fiction has interested me, even those of his works that I found not up to what I expected from him. After his accident, I was worried that his writing would be affected, but &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; put those worries to rest. The book is enjoyable in the way only a King book can be: interesting, frightening, and a good peek into the human condition. How he can get inside the mind of aliens and madmen always amazes me! Of course, this book suffers from some of King's normal faults; it's overwritten, and a lot of it could have been edited out without damaging the story one bit. So what? It's not great literature, but it's entertaining, and that's what I want from Mr. King, to be entertained. He delivers that in a big way, and I look forward to many more years, and many more books, from him.	2001-04-05

Some articles are excellent, others less so. That is the situation with this work, I feel. There are the majority of articles which rate five stars, and there are some which go as low as three. I have therefore averaged out my ratings as a whole, and come up with this four star rating opinion. That having been said, let me recommend this work to you if you are at all interested in learning little bits and pieces about important parts of WW II. It is also quite possible that you will enjoy some of the articles that I did not, for everyone's take on writing is subjective. You may not learn a lot of new information in this book, but at its best the info is presented in extremely interesting ways, and even in some of the lower- rated articles, there are still nuggets of information which I appreciated receiving. You won't be disappointed by reading this work.	2001-03-29

It appears to cover just about all of the events of his life to the battle of Austerlitz, and it does so in a fairly breezy style that doesn't spend a lot of time discussing the boring, mundane details. Even the military sections are rather quickly written, and you don't get bogged down in the intricate details of strategy, which to me is a definite plus. There were a few typos in the book, and my copy did not have the endpaper maps (which annoyed me), but I didn't hold that against the author. I'm looking forward to the second part of this biography, and will definitely buy it when it is published.	2001-03-26

The title intrigued me, so I purchased it. While a lot of the work, at least initially, discusses the embalming of Lenin's corpse, there was a considerable amount of material about life during the purges of Stalin. The author was a witness to many events, albeit from a priviledged position in the Soviet hierarchy, and his recounting of the &quot;show trials&quot; and the terror of the &quot;knock in the middle of the night&quot; is revealed explicitly. There is also some recounting of other Communist leaders being embalmed by Russian experts, the section concerning the work on Ho Chi Minh during the height of the American bombing of North Vietnam being particularly interesting. Read this book to learn many different and interesting things about life under Stalin, and also the early days of the USSR.	2001-03-20

Perhaps he justs needed to &quot;recharge his batteries&quot; with something different, and he certainly came off with a good book in his new series about the Women's Murder Club. It's a riveting story from beginning to end, with believeable and likeable characters, and the usual totally evil murderer. I read it quite quickly, and enjoyed it thoroughly. One thing, though, he seems lately to want to put some shocking-type ending in every book. It's not necessary for the overall enjoyment of the work, but if he wants to do it, and it doesn't detract from the story, who am I to argue? He's the writer, and a very good one. I look forward to further books in this new series.	2001-03-19

Additionally, there were a multitude of memoirs and books of letters published when it was finished. Thus, it is really extensively covered, and this work makes the most of the numerous available sources. Also, this was a &quot;watershed&quot; war; a lot of the tactics harkened back to the Napoleonic era, while much of the hardware and trench warfare looked forward to the more &quot;modern&quot; wars of the early 20th century. The book is replete with extensive quotes, which broke up the narative a bit too much, in my opinion. There were some significant grammatical typos, which were disconcerting. More and better detailed maps, particularly an overview map of the entire area would have been a big help to the general reader. All in all, however, it is well-done work, and you will learn a lot about this often forgotten (except for the &quot;Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;) war.	2001-03-14

What he wanted to do was entertain his readers, and that is what he does, with a bang! I enjoy relaxing with an exciting, page-turning work every so often, and Mr. Higgins' Sean Dillon series is the perfect read. Yesterday was a snowy day, the office was closed, and I started this book right after lunch. The plot kept me going throughout the day, and I finished the book before turning out the light and going to bed. I will admit that, at times, Dillon's almost flawless performance becomes a tad annoying, but he is such a cheeky rascal that I can overlook that possible failing. It's just good to sink into a book, and let the author take you where he wishes. The characters are fairly engaging, and I get interested in finding out how Dillon and friends are going to make everything right in the end. As long as Mr. Higgins keeps writing these tales, I will keep reading them!	2001-03-06

Now that we have lived through the election of 2000, with all of its twists and drama, it is instructive to turn to the election of 1800. That was a time of growth for our young democracy, with all the attendant fears that something new produces in the minds of the people. With untried governmental forms, there was no telling how a crisis would be resolved: would the union of states remain together, or split asunder? The author has done a masterful job in recounting this extremely turbulent period of our history. This is not new ground; I have read many works, both fiction and nonfiction, of this period, and each one of them adds something to my knowledge of what happened in the period of 1787 to 1801. This book is a quite lucid account of the times and the personalities, and is quite informative in a breezy, no-nonsense style. It's worth reading, if only to judge that we, in this time, are not unique in what we have just experienced.	2001-03-05

Such a book is this one, by a well-respected Civil War writer. I must confess that I knew absolutely nothing about hostage-taking during that war, and this work was quite welcome to me, because it informed me in great detail about that situation. A fratricidal war was horrible enough, but when both fighting men, and civilians, were used by the opposing forces as pawns, this war was reduced to one level above barbarism. Thankfully, the good senses of those in charge took control, and there were not tragic consequences of this practice. The writing is clear and concise, and although some of the situations were glossed over when I would have wished for more detail, I found this work as a whole interesting and, definitely, quite informative.	2001-02-26

It is quite long, and every page is densely packed with information, some of it unnecessary. The author uses his life to illustrate many of his points, a tactic I found annoying and intrusive. Granted, he is quite sincere in his positions and beliefs, but I could have done with the &quot;personal touch&quot;. I felt that it detracted from his message. My Church, unfortunately, has a long history of intolerance, and I will not attempt to either hide, or whitewash, it. I agree with the author that Pope Pius XII could have been a more vocal moral leader during World War II, particularly when it came to the campaign against the Jews. Was he afraid of martyrdom? A brutal Nazi reaction to a moral stand might have made a lot of difference at that time, but we'll never know now. Should Pius XII be declared a saint? I have my doubts. One good thing resulted from my reading of this book: without ever reading anything written by Abelard, I find that his concept of a loving and forgiving God is the same as mine. Read this book to learn many things you probably never knew, but be prepared to disagree with some of its conclusions.	2001-02-23

This is not another of his Kenzie and Gennaro tales, but the characterizations and the setting are the same: the soon-to-be-gentried older neighborhoods. These are places of despair and failure, but also places where folks try to live their lives as best they can, under the circumstances. We are granted the status of voyeurs into this area, and the heartbreak and the happiness that we see gives us new perspective into everyday living. Lehane is an author of rare power, and his writing chills us while we race along, turning the pages to discover what is going to happen next to people that we come to care about quite deeply, even the flawed, failing ones. Very few authors have the ability to call forth that type of emotion from me while I read, but Lehane can, and does. I don't want his works to end, and I eagerly look forward to the next book. Read him; you won't be disappointed!	2001-02-20

This is a gruesome story in many instances, describing in great detail what happened when the fire began under the big top, and the ensuing panic and death. There are stories of parents sacrificing themselves to save their children, and of the heroic efforts of the circus people and average citizens to rescue the victims. The book has a plethora of photos, which makes the story that more compelling, because of the images they convey. The prose is taut, but several times the author uses the word &quot;ahold&quot;, which grated on my sensibilities. The attempts, throughout the years, to ascertain the identity of Little Miss 1565 was extremely poignant. This episode is one of the little-known events of our history, and is well worth reading about, for these people deserve to have their story told to a new generation.	2001-02-13

I found the subject very compelling, because I have always had a desire to see the Matterhorn, a desire that began when I saw, as a young boy, Walt Disney's &quot;Third Man On The Mountain&quot;. Having lived one winter in Denver, I loved going into the Rockies and just looking around, and observing the majesty of creation. This work is a very good introduction to the beginning of mountaineering in Europe, and is suitable for the general reader. Anyone who considers themselves learned in the field will probably not like this work, but I enjoy learning something new in everything I read, and this book certainly gave me that type of information. There were a few typos scattered here and there, but they didn't detract from my pleasure in reading this work. The writing style is casual, and it's something worth reading if you love mountains, and like hearing about the odd and determined people who climb them.	2001-02-09

Often, we feel that we are alone in dealing with this problem, and then along comes a book such as this, and shows that others have experienced the same situations. This is a work of rare insight and power, with the pain of a family severely tried by mental illness showing all over it. Granted, there are sections of happiness and semi-good times, but the main focus is on the disruption in the lives of the &quot;normal&quot; members of the family, and its effect upon them in various stages of their lives. The &quot;ill&quot; sister is not made an object of either fun or derision, but the depth of understanding the author brings to her sister's condition is astounding. Her own life is colored, for the most part, by her upbringing in this somewhat disfunctional family setting, and she struggles throughout the book to find her rightful place in the cosmos. There is no traditional &quot;happy ending&quot;, but there rarely is for those who deal with these types of situations. The author suggests, after the book ends, that people who are interested in their own mental health or that of a loved one, contact the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI). It's an excellent organization to which my family contributes, and I also highly recommend it, as I do reading this book. You will find that you are not alone.	2001-02-01

Henryk Sienkiewicz, perhaps the greatest of Polish authors (and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature), is almost unknown in this country. Part of the problem is that, in years past, the translations of his works were extremely stilted, and readers could not get interested in the stories, which are excellent. W.S. Kuniczak, himself a noted Polish-American author (read his &quot;Thousand Hour Day&quot;) has translated Sienkiewicz's prose into robust, modern English, and the tales take flight. This work, the first of a trilogy (I've read all three, and they are all excellent), contains stirring battle scenes, lush landscape descriptions (Sienkiewicz never saw the Ukranian steppes about which he wrote so eloquently; he once crossed the Great Plains by train and transported what he saw of our country into his work), valiant heroes, virtuous maidens, and nasty villains. You'll also learn more than a bit of Polish history, and that is a heritage of which I am very proud. No matter what your ethnic origins, however, you will enjoy this book if you like tales of derring-do, hairbreadth escapes, and old-fashioned concepts of honor and nobility.	2001-01-25

I first read it as a freshman in high school (in 1960, when apartheid was still the law of South Africa), and the sheer beauty of the language took away my breath. The words were so powerful that I memorized many portions of the text, just so I would be able to repeat the words aloud whenever I wished. When JFK was assassinated in 1963, I gave a presentation to my senior English class, and began it with the section of this book that starts: &quot;There is not much talking now, a silence falls on them all....&quot; The class was mesmerized at Mr. Paton's eerily appropriate words, and tears were shed. I've always encouraged my own children to read and they are almost as voracious with books as their dad. Needless to say, this is one of the books I highly recommend to them, because of the excellent writing, and I highly recommend it to you for the same reason.	2001-01-25

There is not a lot of new ground broken, but I don't think that was the intent of the author anyway. Additionally, I was fascinated with reading about the campaigns in Rumania, the Balkans, and the Baltic republics, places where conventional histories of the First World War usually ignore what happened. Those brief chapters alone are worth the price of this book, and I highly recommend it because of them. You'll learn something new, particularly about the formation of the freikorps, which had such a devastating effect upon German history in the time period shortly after this book comes to a close.	2001-01-24

I just don't underrstand these folks, mainly British and Commonwealth country citizens, who risked life and limb for what appears to me to be mere illusory fame. Every epedition, it seems, had its share of tragedy and heroism, and thus Shackleton's grand trans-Antarctic trek fits into this mold. Even though his ship, the Endurance, failed to deliver his team to the Polar continent to make the proposed trip, his team of men on the opposite side of Antartica went doggedly on laying food depots to the Beardmore glacier for the men who never arrived. The story of this depot laying is incredible when read, and the sheer devotion to Shackleton revealed in this tale is marvelous. At a distance of almost one hundred years, the most we can do is marvel at these people, even though we can question their reasons for what they did. This is a well-told tale, and we feel grat emotion for their courage, particularly for the silent, cheeful bearing of suffering of the only ordained clergyman buried in the Antarctic. They were larger than life, and we must salute their courage.	2001-01-22

Particularly in the Arctic, expeditions were in weak, wooden hulled ships, and they attempted to break through the massive fields of ice that guard the Polar region. The 1913 Canadian expedition, concerning which this book was written, is an unfortunately typical example of a venture that was almost doomed from the beginning. A bad ship, disorganization, extremely poor planning, purchase of substandard equipment, and finally, abandonment of the men on the doomed ship by the erstwhile leader of the expedition led to a very bad end for many of its members. This is a very grim story of tragedy, but there is some nobility and self-sacrifice involved, also. The capain of the ship Karluk, the &quot;ice master&quot; of the title, comes through as a shining example of courage and perseverance in the face of adversity. He saved the men entrusted to him by the expedition's feckless leader, and did everything he could to bring as many of them home as was humanly possible. This is a grim, often gloomy work, but the courage and sheer stubbornness of the marooned party shines through on almost every page. It's well written and well worth reading.	2001-01-18

I often wonder from what odd corner of the brain come the plots for books by writers such as Dean Koontz. The characters and the situations in his works scare the heck out of me, and how he dreams them up is just amazing. This latest book is a typical example. It grabs the reader from the first page, and the interest and excitement doesn't let up until the end. I was so interested in finding out how the work ended that I slid over huge chunks of description, and some of the dialogue, just so that I could keep pace with the story line. There are a lot of impossible things happening, but I will credit the author with tying everything up fairly neatly at the end. Ah, the end! It's been a long time since the ending of this type of book gave me such a good feeling. Usually by the end of a thriller type work I was worn out with excitemnt. This time, I felt exhilarated, happy and hopeful, and it's a tribute to the willing suspension of disbelief that Koontz brings to his book that I was able to feel this way. Read this book, and be prepared to be frightened along the way, but redeemed by faith at the end.	2001-01-15

This work details the Federalist period from 1790 onward, and the opening years of the Jefferson presidency, and covers the ground very well. It is a novel, of course, but so well written it seems as if Safire was a fly on the wall in the various locales of the tale, and took down verbatim the words of the characters, historical figures all. His language is excellent, as is to be expected from this writer, who is a grammar maven. Once or twice, however, I seemed to detect a hint that some of the historical events were talked about a tad before they acutually happened, and once or twice there was some duplication, which should have been caught by a more zealous editor. They didn't detract from my enjoyment of this work, and I recommend it to anyone interested in this period of American history, and in particular, interested in the human side of the historical drama.	2001-01-08

The study of American history constantly surprises me. Just when I think that I know enough about a certain period of our country's history, along comes a book that gives me a whole new perspective on it. This is one of those books. Like most Americans, I assumed that I had a pretty solid grasp on the &quot;Founding Fathers&quot; of the Revolution, but apparently I was wrong. Reading this work gave me a new appreciation of the innate political shrewdness of George Washington, the probity and sagacity of John Adams, and the inner contradictions of the mind of Thomas Jefferson. I grasped more fully the leading role Alexander Hamilton played in the 1790s, and received a much more moderate view of the character of Aaron Burr. This is an excellent work, and one which may be used as a standard against which future histories of the post-revolutionary period may be judged.	2001-01-02

Needing something to pass the time, the heft of this book seemed to be appropriate. This was a very good purchase, because I enjoyed the work very much. The action begins on the first page, and continues until the very end, some 900 pages or so. It kept my interest, and the pages turned quickly, and the time passed. DeMille certainly knows how to write a thriller, and he settles some festering scores with critics of the movie version of his &quot;The General's Daughter&quot;, which tickled me. This book is going to be a good &quot;beach book&quot; next summer, but it's worth reading anytime you want to be caught up in a very exciting and interesting thriller.	2001-01-02

The author has interviewed, either personally or through written statement, many hundreds of former Marines, and ably synthesized their remembrances into an exceptional work on the Marine Corps in World War II. There is no doubt that this book was a &quot;labor of love&quot;, and that love for the men involved shines through on every page. It's a complete catalog of the Pacific war, with sole emphasis on the men who fought, not the strategy and tactics involved in its winning. From beginning to end the reader feels involved with the subjects of the work, and there will be laughter and tears aplenty during the reading. At the dawn of this new century, we can only look back with awe at these unassuming heroes who risked everything, and often gave their lives, so that we might live in peace and freedom today. Monuments are not enough; books such as this are the truest, and best, legacy of their valor and self-sacrifice.	2000-12-21

The anecdotes are interesting, and it doesn't get bogged down in a lot of detail, which should assist the casual reader. That having been said, there are a number of factual errors contained within it, and a more careful editing would have eliminated the redundancies I came across, including using the same quote more than once. If you want a quick overview of the subject, however, and don't care to delve too deeply into it, this is the book for you.	2000-12-18

The inadequate research, underfunding, and the willy-nilly selection of leaders and expedition members practically doomed the Greely excursion to Lady Franklin Bay before it began. Once under way, the objections and obstructions put forth by Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln definitely contributed to the tragedy that ensued. There is no doubt that the members of the expedition acted very heroically in many instances, including the commander himself, but there are also many times when foolish things happened, and those things had tragic consequences later. Reading this book is a good cautionary tale: plan ahead for as many contingencies as possible, have proper funding, and make sure that instructions are sufficiently clear and flexible enough to take into account changing situations.	2000-12-11

Initially I was not disappointed, for there is action from the beginning, and an interesting plot. Unfortunately, as things go on there is so much philosophical-type discussion among the characters that it tends to dominate the pages, and I slowly began to lose interest, even when exciting things began to happen. Perhaps it's just me, but there seemed to be an extremely huge hole in the plot that made the ending of the book completely implausible. The world created and described by the author appears to be a good extrapolation of today's conditions, but that's not enough to rescue this work.	2000-12-06

The author grabs the reader from the beginning ,when the protagonist wakes up without his memory in the men's room of Union Station in Washington, D.C., and doesn't let go until the satisfying ending, several hundred pages later. I began reading, was immediately hooked, and went along for the ride! There was always something going on in the book, and never a dull moment, or page, in it. The plot comes together nicely at the end, with a completely plausible conclusion, which I think is important in a work of this type. This is a great page-turner, and will keep any reader happily occupied during the time it will take him or her to rush through it at the author's hectic pace.	2000-12-04

They are fast-paced, filled with events and action, and hold my interest. With the short chapters and lack of a lot of description, they are easy to read in only a few hours. That having been said, I must admit, to my chagrin, that I did not like this work as much as I had expected, and it's all due to the ending. I never spend time while reading trying to &quot;guess&quot; who the killer or such is; I know the author will let us know in the end. In most books, there are subtle clues that, ocasionally, point to the correct person, and astute readers may be able to discern his or her identity. In this book, I really believe that the author pulled the villain out of thin air, for there is nothing anywhere in my reading of the book that even remotely connected this person to the action and crimes involved. I was greatly disappointed, for I expected more from Mr. Patterson. My rating should be lower, I know, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt, for it's possible I missed something along the way while I was reading. Don't get me wrong; you'll enjoy this book, and it will keep you turning the pages quickly. It's the ending, though, that may give you pause. (I'm holding up the ballot to my forehead, looking for the dimpled chad, and discern..... a sequel!)	2000-12-01

This work is an excellent example of the history of one unit from Omaha Beach to V-E day. There are enough first person quotes to show the authenticity of the record, and the writing, though a bit stiff at times, reveals an exciting tale of action, heroism, danger and death. I know that the author has done his research well, for he states that many tankers suffered hearing loss due to their proximity to the large tank weapons going off in the confined space of a tank. That's absolutely true, for my father had a significant hearing loss in his right ear, which was the ear closest to the turret gun of his tank destroyer. If tanks are your thing, or if you just like to read a good small unit history from WW II, I highly recomment this book.	2000-11-27

The presidential candidate of one political p[arty is ridiculed for stating that Jesus is his favorite philosopher, and the vice-presidential candidate of the other political party is castigated for speaking about religion. What has happened to the moral tone of this country, which was founded by God-fearing men? Have we completely abandoned the idea that there is a Being who guides and guards us in all that we do? Abraham Lincoln, arguably our greatest president, believed that there was Someone watching over us at all times. He also believed vehemently that our governmental system was important, and that its structure was the best that could have been devised for the country. His words are eloquent, and call to us across the gap of 150 years. Reading this work, it is easy to restore some confidence in our governmental system, even though now it is being sorely tested by the eletoral events in Florida. This work could not have come along at a better time in our history, and it is well worth reading.	2000-11-27

Often what many Americans know about him is confined to the Disney cartoon &quot;Ben &amp; Me&quot;, wherein he's portrayed as a somewhat eccentric inventor who befriends a mouse, and experiments with electricity by flying a kite in a thunderstorm. The reality is much, much more than that, and this new biography gives us the whole man, with all of his many accomplishments. After reading this long work, it is clear that American history would have taken an entirely different course if Franklin had not been the kind of Renaissance man he was, or had not used his prodigious talents in the service of his country. There is a lot of detail in this work, perhaps too much at times, but it does give as complete a picture of Franklin's life as we will see in this generation. With all of the political wrangling going on around us in this current election crisis, it's refreshing to step back and see the multitude of obstacles the Founding Fathers had to overcome to allow us to, more or less, peacefully settle a potentially divisive issue. Franklin deserves a lot of credit for how we are today, and this work more than adequately bestows it on him.	2000-11-22

It's been a while since his last book, and it's clear that he's  used his time well, for this work is a real &quot;rip-snorter&quot;! There doesn't appear to be a page that isn't crammed with action, and you just keep turning them to see how the plot is going. True, there 's a lot of exposition that we don't need, but some of the sidelights tend to be interesting, as is the guided tour around many interesting places in the world. The plot is convoluted enought for even the most hardened thriller mavens, and though you know the hero is going to prevail, it's still a very interesting ride along the way. The ending was satisfying, but somewhat enigmatic, seeming to point the way to a sequel, but that's fine with me, for I can never get enough of Ludlum!	2000-11-13

I've never read a mystery set in the Civil War times before, and I thoroughly enjoyed this one. The detail and sense of place gave me the impression that the author did an enormous amount of research into the personalities and the times. I can't vouch for the accuracy of his Washington scenes, but the narrator is from the Anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania, where I reside. When the action shifts to Pottsville and vicinity, and discusses some of the historical characters there, I know the author is correct, for I am well acquainted with the geography and streets of Pottsville, and other persons mentioned in the book. The accuracy is comforting, for then I know the author has the research knowledge to be true to the historical record, as far as it is necessary to advance his story. It's well-written, and I look forward to more tales of the exploits of Major Abel Jones.	2000-11-06

It is with a great deal of pleassure, then, that I read works devoted to this subject, particularly if they are understandable to a layman such as myself. This newest work is a perfect example of the best type of writing in this field: it breaks new ground for me, and I understand it because the writing isn't geared only for the &quot;inner circle&quot; of scholars in the field. The author delves deeply but clearly into the times and the sources, and supports her hypothesis quite strongly. I know that there are probably many people who disagree with what she states, but she has her ground and she stands it well. I take no sides in the ongoing controversy; I just enjoy reading all sides to the arguments, and this work is an excellent addition to the literature on the subject of the historic Jesus. Whether or not the author is correct in her position we will never know, because of the 2000 year time difference from the life to the writing, but we can speculate, and the author does her speculating well. This is a book well worth reading; you don't have to agree with its conclusions to admire the scholarship that went into composing it.	2000-10-30

I've read several of his works, and thoroughly enjoyed all of them. When I began this latest one, I had assumed, because of its structure, that it was simply a series of short stories. Eventually I realized that it was, indeed, a novel, and a wonderful one at that! I loved the characters and the often bizarre situations in which they found themselves. Readers will, I'm sure, be way ahead of the narrator in discovering what is going on around him, but the charm of the writing, and the pure beauty of the story (and its perhaps too-sentimental ending) will enchant you. If you yearn for things the way they used to be, when life just seemed to be simpler and more fulfilling, you'll enjoy reading this book.	2000-10-18

This latest one is an excellent addition to his literary output, and I enjoyed it very much. He doesn't go into the sometimes excruciating detail I found in &quot;Empire Express&quot; which I read a few months ago, and that's fine with me. Occasionally less is more, and the emphasis on the work itself, rather than the financial dealings, was welcome. Both books, coming out so close together, told a comprehensive story, and each one gave me different and additional information. The earlier work, despite its name, was a &quot;local&quot;, but this new one by Ambrose was an &quot;express&quot;.	2000-10-16

The decision was a wise one, for I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writing is first-rate, and the mystery sufficiently complicated so as to keep me guessing until the end. Even at that point, there were additional surprises in store, both for the reader, and the main character. I look forward to reading the next two books in this planned trilogy, and hope that the enthusiastic response will encourage the author to continue the series even further.	2000-09-29

It shows how dogged police work, and often just plain luck, combines to solve a mysterious death. My one quibble was that, after all the convoluted twists and turns in the plot, the ending seemed rather rushed. Other than that, it's worth reading, and will keep your interst from beginning until the end.	2000-09-25

I don't  want to give away any of the sometimes convoluted plot, except to say that  it kept me reading, and in stitches at some of the dialogue.

Oh, it's well-written and pleasant to read, with the usual  assortment of eccentrics that only English authors seem to be able to  create. Unfortunately, I couldn't really get interested in what happens to  the characters in the story, even though I tried very hard. It's a good  book to spend some quiet time reading, and it will relax you with its  language and languid pace. Perhaps it's finally showing its age, being over  a half-century old, and seemingly rooted in another world and time  entirely. Don't be put off by what I say; read it and make your own  determination. You may enjoy it very much, that's the beauty of literature;  one size definitely does not fit all!	2000-09-12

Civil war is about to break out in  Rome, with the rivalry between Caesar and Pompey coming to a head. To make  everything worse, a close relative of Pompey's is killed in Gordianus'  home, and the Great One coerces Gordianus to find the killer by impressing  our hero's son-in-law into his service. As usual, the author's extensive  knowledge of ancient Rome is worn lightly, so that you learn a lot about  the time and place without appearing to be taught. This series is every bit  as good as the Marcus Didius Falco series on Rome, even though it takes  place a century earlier. If you haven't read any of these books, begin the  series and go through them all seven of them. They are well worth the  effort!	2000-09-12

Now we are in the state  of Utah, and there are some very interesting scenes set in the household of  an unusual offshoot of the Mormon religion. Fremont is fairly passive  through most of the book, and the action is carried by Michael and Meiling,  which is quite a change of pace. There is a mystery, of sorts, but it  appears to be rather hastily concluded, and in a somewhat simplistic  manner, but the book is generally well-written and it kept my interest.	2000-09-07

I knew nothing about this historical situation, other than there was a  happy outcome, and I was interested in learning how the trapped men were  rescued. The tale is extremely interesting, and even though there were  parts of the technical explanation that went quite a bit over my head, I  found the work fascinating. The sheer determination of Swede Momsen in  developing sub rescue devices, in the face of the oppostion of the Navy  brass, is uplifting. He was a true American hero, and should be much more  widely known than he is today. Hopefully this book will rectify that  situation.	2000-09-05

This book, at last, tells the  tale, and an exciting one it is! Cornwell is an excellent writer, with an  eye for even the smallest detail. His description of the battle of Assaye  is, in my mind, the finest portrayal of any Napoleonic-era fight that I  have ever read. The book has a lot of virtues; strong characterization,  good plot, etc., but the battle scenes alone are worth the reading! All  true Sharpe fans will love this work.	2000-09-05

The author isn't  interested in telling a &quot;big story&quot;; his plots tend to be slight,  but it's the characters themselves, their inner thoughts and their reaction  to people and things around them, that make these books. This work takes  place in the 19th century, a new time period for the author, and one in  which his characters navigate with aplomb. Once again, there's a mystery,  but it's really only a plot device upon which the author hangs his  character studies. It's a relatively short book, and you will keep turning  pages long after you probably should have retired for the night, if you  read in bed, as I do. The translator is to be especially commended, for the  grace and poetry of the language in the book adds much to its appeal. It's  so well-translated that at no time did I even have the slightest impression  that this was originally written in another language, the highest  compliment one can pay to a translator.	2000-08-29

She praised it highly, so I thought that I'd read it also. I'm  very happy that I did. The author weaves magic and chocolate into a brew of  life in a small French town, and the reaction of the population to the  arrival of a stranger and her young daughter. Soon a chocolate shop is  opened, and thus begins a silent but none the less deadly war between the  heroine and the local vicar, who is painted as not a very nice person. It's  well done, and has a satisfying ending, with just the right blend to be  called bittersweet. Read it, you'll like it!	2000-08-25

It's difficult in this  extremely secular time to present a cogent history of a time and place  where faith and miracles appeared to be nothing out of the ordinary, such  as this backward region of France in the mid-nineteenth century. Like most  Catholics of my time, I knew some general things about events at Lourdes,  but the detail included in this book is astonishing! At times the work is a  bit tough going, but it is always interesting and informative. The author  maintains a carefully-orchestrated neutrality during the entire course of  her book, and that alone is commendable. It's worth reading if for nothing  else than to see how entire lives were immersed in religion and belief in  the hereafter and the manifestation of God's benevolence towards the world  through the intercession of His mother. You don't have to be of any  particular religious persuasion to be awed by the simple faith of many of  these people, and the trust they had that there were still times when  miracles happened. I envy them their belief, and I applaud the author for  not condescending to them. She has done a marvelous job!	2000-08-18

It  covered the subject clearly and concisely, and did not patronize the  Chinese point of view in this unfortunate and easy to have averted  conflict. The book also satisfied one of my requirements: there were  several, extremely helpful maps, which made understanding places and  situations even easier. The story is told in a breezy style that kept my  interest, which is important in a history book, since you already know the  outcome.	2000-08-14

It turns completely around the conventional theory  that the Western countries were directly and solely responsible for what  happened during and after World War I in the area of the Ottoman Empire.  The authors place much of the blame for the results on the Ottoman  leadership iteself, and the political land-grabbing of the Hashemite  family. Not being an expert in this area, I have adopted a neutral attitude  in this controversy, and am more than willing to read works that contradict  this idea. My one quibble with this book, and it caused my rating to be  lowered, is that there is an almost complete absence of adequate maps of  the areas in question. To discuss places not normally familiar to Western  readers, it is essential that works provide maps as references. I was  continually frustrated throughout my reading when I couldn't find a map  that showed a place that was under discussion in the text.	2000-08-07

The author creates a believeable world, peopled with  fully-drawn characters, and gives us a story that holds our interest from  beginning to end. It's a people-oriented story, and even the Great Fire of  London and the Great Plague become minor incidents in the life of Jeremiah  Mount, the hard luck acquaintance and erstwhile friend of Mr. Pepys.  Everything is well told, from life in the underbelly of London to the  steamy landscape of colonial Jamaica. You follow the life of Jem Mount with  great interest and, even though you know he's not a very nice person, you  always hope against hope that he does well in the end. To make such an  unlikely person a character in which you have such interest is a triumph  for the author, and a sign of extremely good writing skills. This is  definitely worth reading!	2000-07-26

The mystery is well done, with  the required red herrings and obvious suspects who turn out not to be so  obvious in the end.

Well-written it certainly is, but I'm not quite sure that I  got the point of it, or if there even is a point to get! The enigmatic  ending alone was enough to make me think that I probably missed the  author's intent throughout the work.

That's the crux of this very well-written, historical novel. The author paints what appears to be an  accurate poicture of time and place, and her characters are well-drawn,  even the minor ones. This is a somewhat sorrowful story, but a chilling  cautionary tale that reveals how advances in medical science came about in  times when class warfare and suspicion were the rule, rather than the  exception. It's not a pretty book by any means, but worth reading to learn  the way of life of 175 years ago in a town ravaged by cholera morbus.	2000-07-12

This particular book  concentrates on the Chosin Reservoir campaign, and the story of the Marine  &quot;breakout&quot;. It is a tale of ineptitude on the part of the high  command, and almost unbelieveable bravery on the part of the average  fighting man. Any reader will be profoundly moved by the stories in this  work, and amazed that these men survived what was considered, at the time,  an encirclement that would only result in their surrender. At times  inartfully written, and occasionally confusing (better maps might have  helped), this book is a stirring tribute to the unconquerable spirit of the  American fighting man at the middle of the 20th century.	2000-07-07

Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it as much as I had expected to. It has definite literary quality, but I just couldn't get  involved in the story. There was a lot of jumping back and forth in time  and place, and it was somewhat disconcerting. In addition, the almost  complete lack of background gave this reader a strong feeling of  disconnectedness to the characters. It was difficult to get interested in  the characters, as they seemed to be drawn very cursorily. Learning about  Sri Lanka was a plus, but not enough of one for me to really recommend  reading this book.	2000-07-03

Unfortunately, these brave folks are dying by the thousands every  day, and soon their individual stories will be lost forever. Growing up, I  was fascinated with World War II, in which my father had driven a tank  destroyer, been wounded five times, and saw active duty from the invasion  of North Africa to VE day. For some reason, I never sat down with him and  discussed the war, and now that he's gone, I regret it deeply. We should  take every opportunity to learn directly the stories of these folks, and  what they experienced. This book is a welcome addition to the first-person  narratives of the war that, thankfully, are coming out at this time. The  sheer unassuming heroism of the Marines on Iwo Jima staggers the mind, and  the fact that the survivors don't consider themselves heroes, is typical of  that generation. The war left lasting memories on most of them, but they  bore their burdens without complaint. My mother tells me that, for years  after they were married, my father would get up in the middle of the night  with terrible headaches, the result of a head wound. As a child, I never  knew this about him, but the quiet and serenity with which he bore this  pain only makes me love him more, and appreciate him more, if such a thing  is possible. We must not forget what they did for us, and reading this book  will help. Please buy it.	2000-06-29

There doesn't appear to be much of a plot at the beginning, but once the action takes hold of you, there is a sense of  unrelenting suspense that keeps your attention until the conclusion. The  author wears his research lightly, but I felt that I was actually viewing  events and characters from 1867 New York. Even the minor characters have  depth to them, which is often unusual. This is also a very literary work,  but one which rewards the reader with excellent writing, a quality that is  all too often lacking in the vast majority of what pass for &quot;best  sellers&quot; these days.	2000-06-27

Sam Jones is  not the typical female character, but rather an independent, single person  who lets nothing stand in her way when she has the scent of a good mystery.  The tale is well-told, with a number of interesting characters and minor  plots. The mystery is rather straight-forward, but that's all right with  me: I'm not engaged in a guessing game with the author, I just like to read  the book. Some references to things only known by British readers tends to  be puzzling, but I'm sure overseas readers of American books have the same  problem. This is well done, and a good diversion for a few hours at any  time of year.	2000-06-12

I found the story line quite interesting, and the characters engaging. The world of Church politics is an always fascinating one, and  the author appears to take the hierarchy to task for many of the decisions  being made in the modern world. The prose is well-done, and the translator  does a fine job in this instance, letting the nuances of the original come  through. It's worth reading, although I feel that the plot is merely a  convenience for the author's use in hanging on an interesting character  study of the priest-protagonist. That's all right, though, the work is  worthy of being read in itself, not necessarily for finding out  &quot;whodunnit&quot;.	2000-06-12

I was surprised, upon reading it, to discover that only a very  small part of the book discussed the 1918 outbreak; the majority of it  concerned the scientific search for the cause of the killer virus. It is a  fascinating tale, even if it's not the reason I purchased the book.  Occasionally, the scientific language caused my eyes to glaze over, but I  still found it interesting. My older daughter, a science grad from MIT who  is doing Phd work in neurobiology at Harvard, told me she wants to read  this book. I think she'll understand a lot more of it than I did!	2000-06-06

The decision to purchase it is one that I  will not regret, for it is a wonderful, and well-written, work of fiction.  The year is 1662, and a feeble-minded but good-natured teenager reigns in  Portugal, but the Inquisition actually rules. In a remote village strange  sights appear, and an &quot;acorn&quot; crashes to earth, leaving two live,  and one dead, &quot;creatures&quot;. But what exactly are these beings, and  what about the other signs and wonders appearing in the area? The Holy  Office of the Church will get to the bottom of the mystery, or people will  burn.  This book shows the fine line between faith and fanaticism, courage  and foolishness, and love and lust. The language is all that I had expected  from the author of &quot;Flanders&quot;, and the pure emotion of this book  practically leaps off of the page at you. The Church, and certain  clergymen, do not fare well in their portrayal, but then, the Church has  much to apologise for concerning the Inquisition. As I said when I reviewed  &quot;Flanders&quot;, read this book!	2000-06-03

Chair and desk-bound upper-class officeholders sent idle  military men all over the globe to explore and map places, some of which  had no earthly benefit to the mother country. The tales this book tells are  thrilling, and even when you know that a specific expedition is going to  come to a bad end, you keep hoping the conclusion will be different. The  author does an excellent job of retelling what happened on these trips to  Africa and the two polar areas, and interest never flags. There were a few  typographic errors, but they didn't detract from the enjoyment of reading  this work. I recommend it to anyone intersted in 19th century exploration,  or British eccentricities in general.	2000-05-30

It was bright and breezy, but packed with information concerning the Ottomans and their  history. My one complaint is that there was a lot of time-jumping; I prefer  my history works to be much more linear (this happened, and then because of  it, that happened...). Also, more dating of events would have been helpful.  Those relatively minor complaints aside, I would definitely recommend this  work as one to be read for information without a lot of effort.	2000-05-26

I liked it, but I didn't enjoy it. That sounds like a contradiction, but that's as close as I can get to describing my feeling upon completing it. As a reader, I was impressed with  the author's facility with language, and the way he was able to weave into  his tale all types of information, relevant and irrelevant. What I missed,  however, was the essense of Shakespeare, the supposed raison d'etre for the  whole work! In summation: if you read to be dazzled by the writer's  legerdemain with words, read the book; if you want to learn something, even  a little, from what you read, don't try this one.	2000-05-22

My wife has been bugging me for a long time to get rid of a lot of old things in our basement and attic, and, being a lazy guy, I've been putting it off by telling her I'm waiting to sell some of it for cash. She saw an  ad for this book in the local newspaper, and told me to buy it, thus  calling my bluff. Actually, I'm happy that I did, for the book is a  cornucopia of information about potential buyers for a myriad of things you  may find around your house. There's an excellent 20 page introduction, and  an extensive index for the various items that may be of interest to  dealers, and individuals. I'm putting off the day of reckoning by telling  my wife I must study this book intently, but already I've found one thing  that I considered junk, which may be valuable to someone: my 1964  presidential compaign can that once contained 12 ounces of &quot;Gold  Water; the right drink for the conservative taste&quot;.

I knew absolutely nothing about this book when I saw it lying on a pile in a bookstore with other newly issued paperbacks, nor was the author familiar to me. What caught my eye was the fact that this was named a New York Times  Notable Book, so I picked it up, opened it at random, and read a little.  The sheer beauty of the writing took away my breath, and I knew I had to  buy the book and read it! This was a snap decision I have no reason to  regret. I don't understand how lesser books become bestsellers, and books  such as this, literate and powerfully written, languish practically  unknown. Everything about this work is nearly perfect, from the narrative  voice, to the surrounding minutia. It's a spare, tense, sad, and ultimately  glorious book, and you MUST read it. Run, do not walk, to your nearest  bookstore or on-line book-seller, and purchase this book. You will not be  disappointed. Spread the word to everyone you know: read this book!	2000-05-12

I told myself that I would have to read this work, to get further insight into the early history  of the Church. I'm very happy that I did, for this book, even though it is  1700 years old, is extremely interesting and informative on very early  Church history. Many, many names were unfamiliar to me, but the helpful  &quot;Who's Who&quot; in the back was a life saver. Constantly consulting  it extended my reading time to double what it would have been otherwise,  but I couldn't have understood the work as well without the assistance.

It concentrates, initially, on the arrogance and pride of the American weathermen who ignored Cuban forecasters warnings of the presence of a dangerous storm. This attitude of national superiority of intelligence  was to cost the people of Galveston dearly, for the lack of advance warning  was directly responsible for the debacle and loss of lives that came in the  wake of this killer storm. This is a cautionary tale wrapped up in a  well-presented historical package, and is well worth reading.	2000-04-27

It's very humbling, then, when I come across a book that covers a subject about which I was completely ignorant; in this case, the Mississippi flood of 1927. The author quite lucidly  explores the  background of what happened, with historical trips back into  the 19th century, and then goes through what occurred during the flood  itself, and its aftermath. This work covers a seminal event in the life of  the area of our country touched by that flood that is mostly unknown to the  rest of us. For bringing to light that knowledge alone, he is to be  commended, but the book stands on its own terms as something worth reading.	2000-04-27

I'm usually extremely tolerant of the books I read, and always try to give authors the benefit of the doubt in my reviews. Unfortunately, I just didn't like this book. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly why, but I just  didn't find it either amusing or entertaining. It was an almost non-stop  rant, both bleak and depressing. Occasionally the Irish slang was  offputting, but I overcame that as I went along. There were many times that  I just wanted to throw it against the wall and not finish it, but I felt a  duty to see it through if I wanted to write a review. The one good thing  about this book is that it was fairly short, so I didn't waste a lot of  time on it.	2000-04-24

I always felt, when reading other books about this era, that the character of Rasputin was  somewhat one-sided, and reading in other works that there was a missing  file piqued my interest. Now we have the File brought into the open after  decades, and Rasputin stands revealed as a much more understandable person.  His influence on the tsar and tsarina was strong, with unfortunate  consequences for their family and country.  The information set out in  this book is fascinating, particularly the quotes from the interrogation of  witnesses we have often read about, but never before had the chance to hear  &quot;speak&quot;. My one quibble is that, either the author or the  translator has a quirky writing style, and the unusual grammar and sentence  structure caught my attention initially, and kept interfering with my  reading. Once I became accustomed to it, however, it faded into the  background and didn't prevent me from thoroughly enjoying this book. I  highly recommend it to anyone interested in early 20th century Russian  history.	2000-04-13

I was disappointed that the majority of essays contained far too much information about what did happen than concentrating on  what might have happened, which is what I assumed the purpose of the  book to be. James MacPherson's contribution is an excellent example of how  the entire work should have been structured, but unfortunately was not.  Counterfactual history is a fascinating field, and this work contributes to  it, but not as much as it could have were all the contributions of equal  strength.	2000-04-06

A book of quiet prose, with flashes of  lyricism in the writing. I happened upon &quot;The English Patient&quot;  well before the movie was made, and found it to be a book of that type. So  also would be, to me &quot;Snow Angels&quot;. This work is one to read in a  quiet corner, savoring all of the many nuances in it. A recounting of a  life well-lived, but only in the shadow of great events, and in later  years, a self-effacing existence. There is much sorrow and tragedy in this  work, but also, I feel, an ultimate redemption and triumph of the spirit.  It's worth reading.	2000-04-01

Kershaw uses the sources wonderfully well, and his prose never degenerates into scholarly babble,  able to be interpreted only by others in academia.

The daughter's life was rather mundane, as her letters revealed. The father's life was much more  interesing, but we don't have his letters to illuminate, and are therefore  left with the standard biographical details.

Ancient history fascinates me, particularly the early Roman Empire. Also, being a product of 16 years of Parochial schools, I've acquired a taste for Church and religious history. This book was tremendous, and I enjoyed it  extremely. Of course, my Church History teachers in high school didn't go  into the subject the way this book does. To my teachers, Athanasius of  Alexandiria was a saint, a great man, and the Scourge of Arianism. It's  good to see that he, and Arius also, were human like me, subject to all the  faults and frailties of our nature. I like him better now that he's not the  paragon of virtue I had been taught. Also, the author really explains the  religious controversy in language even a lay person can understand. I found  the subject so fascinating that I intend to purchase Eusebius' work on  early Church history in the near future.	2000-03-17
