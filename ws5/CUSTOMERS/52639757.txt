Customers can often be a real pain . . . Don Gallegos does not<br /><br />dispute this fact, but the supermarket executive (with over 30 years<br /><br />of experience in the field) tells you that you MUST always remember<br /><br />the fact that \\"the customer is not always right . . . but she is always<br /><br />your customer.\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, in his excellent WIN THE CUSTOMER, NOT THE<br /><br />ARGUMENT, Gallegos urges readers to remember<br /><br />that even \\"wrong customers spend money\\" . . . so the key is to provide<br /><br />folks with the best possible service to keep them coming back to<br /><br />your store.<br /><br />Gallegos presents numerous examples that apply to virtually<br /><br />any business . . . I particularly liked his point about it being<br /><br />important to not show the customer that you are right and she<br /><br />is wrong, but rather to make sure that employees help a customer<br /><br />even if they are sure the customer is wrong . . . that way, it is<br /><br />likely that both the customer and the employee will end<br /><br />up satisfied.<br /><br />There were many interesting tidbits in the book; among them:<br /><br />* Customers would write compliments on these cards as well as<br /><br />complaints. Our system was such that EVERY card, regardless<br /><br />if it was a compliment or complaint, earned a phone call from one<br /><br />of the management teams within the store.<br /><br />* Capital Grill is a restaurant in Denver. When you make a reservation<br /><br />they ask if you are celebrating a special occasion and if there is anything<br /><br />extra you would like while you are at the restaurant. When we go there for<br /><br />dinner, they treat us like guests, not customers. Recently, a guest pulled<br /><br />up in front of their free valet parking and told the parking attendant not<br /><br />to take the car too far because it was low on gas. Guess what--the<br /><br />attendant put gas in the car for the customer.<br /><br />* One day, a woman wanted Albertson's private label mayonnaise (one<br /><br />of our competitors), so our manager went to Albertson's supermarket and<br /><br />purchased a case of their mayonnaise. Then he called the woman, telling<br /><br />her that, from now on, when she wanted a jar of Albertson's private label<br /><br />mayonnaise she would be able to obtain it at his office.<br /><br />He told her that all she had to do was to visit our store and ask the clerk<br /><br />to get the Albertson's mayonnaise for her.<br /><br />\\"And,\\" he added, \\"It's cheaper here.\\"<br /><br />If you get this book, you won't be disappointed!f our competitors), so our manager went to Albertson's supermarket and <br />purchased a case of their mayonnaise.

According to more than<br /><br />70 celebrities, politicians and top business people, the answer<br /><br />is a resounding YES.<br /><br />I found that out by reading THE GAMES DO COUNT by<br /><br />Brian Kilmeade, cohost of Fox News Channel's FOX &<br /><br />FRIENDS . . . in his very entertaining book, Kilmeade collected<br /><br />a series of vignettes from a wide range of people including<br /><br />Henry Kissinger and Tony Danza, as well as Condoleezaa<br /><br />Rice, Robin Williams and a whole host of other folks who<br /><br />have not often shared their memories publicly.<br /><br />Many of these I even found quite inspirational, such as this<br /><br />one from Roger Ailes (the television producer and political<br /><br />consultant):<br /><br />I once talked to a guy who was one of Richard Nixon's coaches.<br /><br />I asked him, \\"Was Nixon any good?\\"<br /><br />He said, \\"No, he was the worst player I ever had.\\"<br /><br />I said, \\"Well what's the story?\\"<br /><br />He said, \\"He showed up first for practice every day. Guys would run<br /><br />over his position and stomp him into the ground, and he always<br /><br />got back up. I finally put him in a game, so he'd win a letter, because<br /><br />the guy never quit.\\" You could see that in the man. You could also<br /><br />see it in Reagan by the way he walked and handled himself. It's<br /><br />true . . . people who win never quit.<br /><br />In addition, the book helped me to see what drives others who<br /><br />are successful . . . for example, there was this passage from<br /><br />Pat Williams (sports executive and motivational speaker<br /><br />who I've always most admired because he has raised<br /><br />19 children):<br /><br />Through sports, I've discovered in life that if you've got drive<br /><br />and desire and ambition, one goal simply leads to the next. There's<br /><br />never that point when you've arrived, because in sports there's<br /><br />always another game, another series, another season. You really<br /><br />can't rest on your laurels or look back in sorrow or in triumph,<br /><br />over anything that happens, because things are changing so rapidly.<br /><br />At this point in my life--I'm sixty-three years old--I want to live<br /><br />fully till the end. I don't think at any point you can simply say,<br /><br />\\"Well, I've done enough. My life is over, and now I'm just going<br /><br />to watch the sunset.\\" I don't think that's the way we're meant<br /><br />to live, and sports, I think, offers us that lesson.<br /><br />Lastly, I loved this final bit of advice from the author himself:<br /><br />TV Brian changed this line of thinking. I had a thick New York accent,<br /><br />so I saved my money and took speech classes. I wanted to get better<br /><br />at memorizing, so I bought taped courses. I wanted to refine my<br /><br />comedic skills and test this new memory, so I took a class and spent<br /><br />five years doing stand-up wherever and whenever I could. I also<br /><br />found a way to get to know and at least talk to everyone who was<br /><br />doing a job I aspired to have--Matt Lauer, Jim Caldwell, David<br /><br />Letterman, and Regis Philbin, to name a few.

Think of five qualities you adore in your partner or spouse.<br /><br />Write them down, and tell him or her about them.<br /><br />7.

Or the parent who beats up the coach, or gets into a fight in the<br /><br />stands. Here's a coach who is so intense. Yet he's never laid a hand<br /><br />on anybody.\\"<br /><br />My only complaint about COACH is that it is quite short--only<br /><br />91 pages, in fact, in a 5\\" x 7\\" format  . . . it left me wanting to read<br /><br />more about Lewis' high school days and how he described<br /><br />them . . . such as in the following passage:<br /><br />Graduating from Babe Ruth to the varsity with only the slightest physical<br /><br />justification ( I now resembled less a scoop of vanilla ice cream than a<br /><br />rounder Hobbit) meant coping with an out-of-control hormonal arms race.<br /><br />A few of our players had sprouted sideburns; but the enemy retaliated<br /><br />by growing terrifying little goatees and showing up at games with wives<br /><br />and, on one shocking occasion, children.

I wore the stuff on my perpetually sore right shoulder and<br /><br />elbow. I wore it, also, on the bill of my cap, where Fitz had taught me<br /><br />to put it, to generate the grease for a spitball that might just compensate<br /><br />for my pathetic fastball.

I often tell my students that word of mouth advertising is the<br /><br />best way to go when you want to promote your product or<br /><br />service . . . but that said, I add that it is easier said than<br /><br />done; i.e., until BUZZMARKETING by Mark Hughes came along.<br /><br />This excellent book, subtitled GET PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT<br /><br />YOUR STUFF, gives step-by-step instructions on how to<br /><br />implement a word-of-mouth campaign that works . . . and<br /><br />Hughes should know, in that he was the guy who persuaded<br /><br />the town of Halfway, Oregon, to rename itself Half.com--called<br /><br />\\"one of the greatest publicity coups in history\\" by TIME.<br /><br />What makes BUZZMARKETING both interesting and useful<br /><br />are the many examples, ranging from Miller Lite during the<br /><br />\\"Tastes Great--Less Filling\\" era to AMERICAN IDOL'S use<br /><br />of buzz to become a global phenomenon . . . Hughes also<br /><br />suggests that coming up with the big idea isn't necessarily<br /><br />easy; in fact, \\"to get that one gem of an idea,\\" [he's] \\"had<br /><br />to create and discard seventy more that never see the light of<br /><br />day because, quite frankly, the first seventy really suck.\\"<br /><br />Yet rather than leave you with the feeling that this is<br /><br />impossible to do, he then gives this an actual technique<br /><br />that he has employed . . . such as, \\"When advertising<br /><br />responsibilities were added on top of my marketing at<br /><br />Pep Boys, one of the first things I did was bring the agency account<br /><br />team to Las Vegas . . . to work in the stores. We donned our uniforms,<br /><br />felt our customer's anxiety, solved our customer's problems, say what<br /><br />they looked like, heard what they sounded like. We got under hoods,<br /><br />and inside their heads.\\"<br /><br />Simple stuff when you think about it, but it works . . . as did<br /><br />many other tidbits cited in BUZZMARKETING; to name just a few:<br /><br />* In a very different kind of business, a man named Ian Klein decided<br /><br />to go into the online dating business five years ago. But when you're<br /><br />competing against Match.com, things get pretty competitive. His sister<br /><br />was one of the 64 percent of overweight Americans, and also one of the<br /><br />eighty million single people in America. In time, he made the connection,<br /><br />pushed an unusual button, and created a niche site called<br /><br />OverweightDate.com. Among overweight singles, the whispers started.<br /><br />At Weight Watchers meetings, at bars, everywhere.<br /><br />* I decided to see if we could print a message on a urinal screen--the <br /><br />rubberized screen preventing bubble gum, cigarette butts, and other stuff<br /><br />from clogging up the pipes. Sure enough, it could be done. But what would<br /><br />we print? A simple logo seemed very NASCAResque--a mindless logo<br /><br />slapped on without any vivid connection to our brand or context. Once<br /><br />again I wanted Burma Shave contextual humor to make people smile.<br /><br />I also knew we had to push the envelope in order to generate word of mouth.<br /><br />Ultimately we printed this on the urinal screen: \\"Don't piss away half your<br /><br />money, head to Half.com.\\" A bit controversial, yes. And we weren't oblivious<br /><br />to the potential risk. In fact, we asked both males and females for their<br /><br />opinion of the copy (not that females would ever see it, but they would<br /><br />certainly hear about it.) We knew it would eventually get press, so we<br /><br />wanted to make sure we had the gumption to take the heat and handle<br /><br />it with a sense of humor. It was a go, and we launched the campaign<br /><br />in urinals across Manhattan.<br /><br />* How many people do you know who don't read what is says on the little<br /><br />paper inside the fortune cookie at a Chinese restaurant? Not many.<br /><br/>Just about everyone reads them--96 percent, according to on study.<br /><br />So in place of the lucky numbers on the back of the fortune cookie paper,<br /><br />what if we put an ad for our company?

I never thought I'd choose to read a book about economics; i.e.,<br /><br />until I came across FREAKONOMICS by Steven D. Levitt<br /><br />and Stephen J. Dubner . . . subtitled A ROGUE ECONOMIST<br /><br />EXPLORES THE HIDDEN SIDE OF EVERYTHING, it kept<br /><br />me fascinated from beginning to end.<br /><br />Levitt, who teaches economics at the University of Chicago,<br /><br />looks at things differently than just about everybody else . . . for<br /><br />example, when considering why crime declined in this country,<br /><br />he came up with a simple explanation: Roe v. Wade . . . it had<br /><br />nothing to do with more police on the street; rather, it had<br /><br />everything to do with the fact that millions of poor women were<br /><br />no longer having babies they may have had in the past.<br /><br />He also got me thinking about the answers to such other<br /><br />questions as: Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming<br /><br />pool? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How<br /><br />much do parents really matter?<br /><br />And this one I really enjoyed pondering: What do schoolteachers and<br /><br />sumo wresters have in common? The answer: They both cheat!<br /><br />As much as I don't like to admit the latter fact, Levitt does an<br /><br />excellent job of backing up his statements with facts . . . by the<br /><br />same token, he is highly critical of real estate professionals who<br /><br />make more money selling their own homes than those of<br /><br />non-realtors due to the simple fact that they keep them on the<br /><br />market just a bit longer.<br /><br />There were many thought-provoking passages; among them:<br /><br />* How any give expert treats you, therefore, will depend<br /><br />on how that expert's incentives are set up. Sometimes his<br /><br />incentives may work in your favor. For instance: a study of California<br /><br />auto mechanics found they often passed up a small repair bill by<br /><br />letting failing cars pass emissions inspections-the reason being that<br /><br />lenient mechanics are rewarded with repeat business. But in a<br /><br />different case, an expert's incentives may work against you. In a<br /><br />medical study, it turned out that obstetricians in areas with declining<br /><br />birth rates are much more likely to perform cesarean-section deliveries<br /><br />than obstetricians in growing areas-suggesting that, when business<br /><br />is tough, doctors try to ring up more expensive procedures.<br /><br />* Most impressively, fully 70 percent of the women claimed \\"above<br /><br />average\\" looks, including 24 percent claiming \\"very good looks.\\" The<br /><br />online men too were gorgeous: 67 percent called themselves \\"above<br /><br />average,\\" including 21 percent with \\"very good looks.\\" This leaves<br /><br />only about 30 percent of the users with \\"average\\" looks, including<br /><br />a paltry 1 percent with \\"less than average\\" looks-which suggests<br /><br />that the typical online dater is either a fabulist, a narcissist, or simply<br /><br />resistant to the meaning of \\"average\\". (Or perhaps they are all just<br /><br />realists: as any real-estate agent knows, the typical house isn't<br /><br />\\"charming\\" of \\"fantastic\\", but unless you say it is, no one will even<br /><br />bother to take a look.) Twenty-eight percent of the women on the site<br /><br />said they were blond, a number far beyond the national average,<br /><br />which indicates a lot of dyeing, or lying, or both.<br /><br />* The data show that, on average, a person with a distinctively black<br /><br />name-whether it is a woman named Imani or a man named DeShawn,<br /><br />does have a worse life outcome that a woman named Molly or a man<br /><br />named Jake. But it isn't the fault of their names. If two black boys,<br /><br />Jake Williams and DeShawn Williams, are born in the same neighbor-<br /><br />hood and into the same familial and economic circumstances, they<br /><br />would likely have similar life outcomes. But the kind of parents who<br /><br />name their son Jake don't tend to live in the same neighborhoods or<br /><br />share economic circumstances with the kind of parents who name their<br /><br />son DeShawn. And that's why, on average, a boy named Jake will<br /><br />tend to earn more money and get more education than a boy named<br /><br />DeShawn. A DeShawn is more likely to have been handicapped by a<br /><br />low-education, single-parent back-ground. His name is an indicator,<br /><br />not a cause, of his outcome.

In addition, it means players saying \\"I love you\\"<br /><br />to each other and coaches professing their love for their players.<br /><br />There were several memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />* [Erhmann] \\"And I think the second criterion-the only other criterion<br /><br />for masculinity--Is that all of us ought to have some kind of cause,<br /><br />some kind of purpose in our lives that's bigger than our own individual<br /><br />hopes, dreams, wants, and desires.

Loved Richard Carlson's latest book, EASIER THAN YOU THINK<br /><br />(see also Sections 2, 10 and 11), but that's no real surprise because<br /><br />he is one of favorite authors . . . if his name isn't familiar, then methinks<br /><br />you might want to jot it down and start reading his DON'T SWEAT THE<br /><br />SMALL STUFF or anything else in that series.<br /><br />Carlson has the unique talent to make things simple . . . in EASIER,<br /><br />his subtitle says it all: BECAUSE LIFE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SO<br /><br />HARD . . . it really doesn't, especially if you start implementing what<br /><br />he mentions in his second subtitle: THE SMALL CHANGES THAT<br /><br />ADD UP TO A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE.<br /><br />As an example, his advice from Chapter 18, \\"Set Your Expectations<br /><br />to Zero,\\" hit home because of some of the stress I'm presently<br /><br />encountering with a move into a new home . . . he mentioned that<br /><br />when you work out, you should set your expectations to zero so<br /><br />you can appreciate your body, as opposed to resenting it and<br /><br />wishing you were different.<br /><br />He then cites the story of a dear friend of his dad's who recently<br /><br />died: Even at the very end of Wally's life, he would say, \\"Life<br /><br />doesn't get any better than this. I have today. I have my friends. I<br /><br />can breathe. I'm alive. I'm very happy to be here.\\" And the most<br /><br />beautiful part of Wally's attitude was that everyone who knew<br /><br />him know that he meant every single word.<br /><br />There were many other tidbits I gained from reading EASIER<br /><br />THAN YOU THINK; among them:<br /><br />You can make an articulate argument for either side-being grateful<br /><br />or being overextended. One will lead you toward satisfaction, and<br /><br />the other toward guaranteed and sustained grief. And the beautiful<br /><br />part is that you get to make the choice.<br /><br />If we can accept the fact that the grass is as green as it needs to be<br /><br />and that it's possible for us to be happy right now, then our lives<br /><br />will be easier.

I'll admit it . . . from time to time, I'm a sucker for a love story,<br /><br />particularly if written by Nicholas Sparks (think THE NOTEBOOK,<br /><br />MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, etc.).<br /><br />So when his latest came out, TRUE BELIEVER, I just had<br /><br />to read it . . . and am glad to report that I was not disappointed . . . you<br /><br />won't be, either.<br /><br />TRUE BELIEVER is the story of a New York writer who is an expert<br /><br />on debunking the supernatural . . . when in North Carolina to<br /><br />investigate a story, he meets a librarian who forces him to<br /><br />do something he's never done before; i.e., take a giant leap of faith.<br /><br />As Sparks notes on the book's jacket, \\"One day, you're going to<br /><br />learn something that can't be explained with science. And when that<br /><br />happens, your life's going to change in ways you can't imagine.\\"<br /><br />Several other passages caught my attention, including:<br /><br />* The facts, after all, spoke for themselves. For one thing, Jeremy<br /><br />hadn't loved a woman in years, and though it had been a long<br /><br />time, he could still remember how hehe'd felt back then. He was<br /><br />certain that he would have recognized the feeling again, and<br /><br />frankly, he didn't. And in light of the fact that hehe'd just met the<br /><br />woman, the whole idea seemed preposterous. Even his highly<br /><br />emotional Italian mother didn't believe that true love could blossom<br /><br />overnight. Like his brothers and sisters-in-law, she wanted nothing<br /><br />more for him than to marry and start a family, but if he showed up<br /><br />at her doorstep and said that he'd met someone two days ago and<br /><br />knew she was the one for him, his mother would smack him with<br /><br />a broom, curse in Italian, and drag him to church, sure that he had<br /><br />some serious sins that needed confessing.<br /><br />* Deep down, she knew he was nurturing the hope that she would come<br /><br />with him to New York, but she couldn't figure out why. Didn't he<br /><br />understand that she cared nothing about money of fame? Or about<br /><br />shopping or going to shows or being able to buy Thai food in the<br /><br />middle of the night? Life wasn't about those things. Life was about<br /><br />spending time together, about having the time to walk together<br /><br />holding hands, talking quietly as they watched the sun go down.<br /><br />It wasn't glamorous, but it was, in many ways, the best that life had<br /><br />to offer. Wasn't that how the old saying went? Who, on their deathbed,<br /><br />ever said they wished they had worker harder? Or spent less time enjoying<br /><br />a quiet afternoon? Or spent less time with their family?<br /><br />* \\"You carry yourself with the sort of confidence that a lot of women<br /><br />find appealing. At the same time, I had the sense that you understand<br /><br />what women want, but that for some reason you're unwilling to give<br /><br />yourself completely.\\"<br /><br />\\"What's this got to do with anything?\\"<br /><br />\\" Women want the fairy tale.

I think I've read every book by Richard Carlson (DON'T SWEAT<br /><br />THE SMALL STUFF and DON'T WORRY, MAKE MONEY, to<br /><br />name just a few) and have long been inspired by his writings . . . so<br /><br />imagine my surprise when I came across a Nightingale-Conant<br /><br />program just available on audio cassette: CREATING MIRACLES<br /><br />EVERY DAY.<br /><br />I loved every minute; in fact, my only disappointment is that there<br /><br />were only two cassettes.<br /><br />As the subtitle implies, by listening, you get ideas for HOW TO<br /><br />TURN ORDINARY MOMENTS INTO EXTRAORDINARY<br /><br />EXPERIENCES . . . it really got me thinking about how I could<br /><br />do just that--and gave me specific suggestions on what's needed<br /><br />for me to view the world differently.<br /><br />Among them:<br /><br />1. To put yourself in a state of gratitude, ask yourself,<br /><br />\\"Could this be the last day of my life?\\"<br /><br />2. If the person knows you appreciate them, it brings out the<br /><br />best in them.<br /><br />3. Describe the average American in two words or less:<br /><br />Easily bored.<br /><br />4. Be sure to tell people in your family how much you love them.<br /><br />5. Life is rarely exactly as we meant it to be. The sooner<br /><br />we accept this, the happier we will be.<br /><br />6. Life will not be easier or make us happier when things<br /><br />change. Life is the way it is.<br /><br />7. We are all here for a purpose.<br /><br />8. We are all special and deserve to be treated that way.<br /><br />9. Everything that happened in your past is just a thought,<br /><br />and you can let it go.<br /><br />10. Your life is not your enemy, but your thinking can<br /><br />sure be.<br /><br />11. It's a lot easier to change your thinking than the nature of<br /><br />life.<br /><br />12. Imaging yourself at your own funeral allows you to be very<br /><br />reflective about what you want your life to stand for.<br /><br />13. If you practice being negative, you'll be a very negative<br /><br />person. Better to practice positive thinking.<br /><br />14. Ask at dinner: What was the best thing that happened?<br /><br />What did you see that inspired you? Did you see somebody<br /><br />being nice to somebody else?<br /><br />15. Mother Teresa said, \\"We can't do great things on this<br /><br />Earth. But we can do small things with great love.\\"n. Better to practice positive thinking. <br /> <br />14.

They fit together perfectly; they match. You wouldn't want to put a Chrysler door on a Mercedes car; you wouldn't even want to put a Cadillac, Lexus or a BMW door on the Mercedes body. Although each one may be a marvelous door in its own right, it would not be the perfect match for the Mercedes automobile.<br /><br />Warren presents a very practical guide for finding true love, including:<br />* The 29 dimensions of compatibility--the foolproof test to determine<br />if two people will be happy together;<br />* Your core personal dimensions--the 16 factors that can make or<br />break your relationship; and<br />* The \\"marriage killers\\"--the red flags you can spot during your fist<br />two dates.<br /><br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />How does the person you are considering as a potential marriage partner deal with anger? Does he have his temper under control? Anger mismanagement causes more divorces, I believe, than any other single factor. Many people simply cannot handle their anger,<br />and they take it out on their spouses. Sadly, husbands often take out their anger on their wives, and wives often take out their anger on the children, thus perpetuating a downward spiral into the next generation. Anger, of course, is often the means a person uses to<br />attempt to handle his or her pain. But it can destroy an otherwise good relationship if it is not expressed correctly.<br /><br />As I mentioned previously, I'm convinced that the selection of a marriage partner is the most important, far-reaching decision you will ever make. Let me tell you why. For the rest of your life, every day, you will wake up with this person; much of your day will revolve around this person in one way or another, whether you are at work or at home. You will come home to this person, eat dinner with this person, sit and talk with this person and, hopefully, you will go to bed with this person.

Unfortunately, none of the local papers carry a column, \\"Looking at Language,\\" by Richard Lederer . . . it is something that I'd definitely want to read--especially after enjoying his<br /><br />very funny book, THE REVENGE OF ANGUISHED ENGLISH.<br /><br />In it, he takes actual misuses of the English language and presents them in a series of short chapters that had me laughing from the very first page . . . I never realized that there were so many fluffs and flubs, goofs and gaffes, blunders, botches, boo-boos, and bloopers that are actually run as the gospel, seemingly on a daily basis.<br /><br />They have been issued by students, run in church bulletins, appeared on frozen food packages, and run in newspapers as headlines.<br /><br />The tough part in writing this review was to choose just a few examples that I could share, in that there were so many . . . among them:<br /><br />* On the JOEY BISHOP SHOW, Joey asked Sen. Barry Goldwater if he would like to be on the show twice a week. The senator answered, \\"I'd much rather watch you in bed with my wife.\\"<br /><br />* Attending a wedding for the first time, a little girl whispered to her mother, \\"Why is the bride dressed in white?\\"<br /><br />\\"Because white is the color of happiness, and today is the happiest day of her life.\\"<br /><br />The child thought about this for a moment, then said, \\"So why is the groom wearing black?\\"<br /><br />* [from the Excuses Hall of Fame]<br /><br />My son is under the doctor's care. Please execute him.<br /><br />Please excuse Mary for being absent. She was sick, and I had her shot.<br /><br />Please excuse Jimmy for being. If was his father's fault.<br /><br />Please excuse Tom for being absent yesterday. He had diarrhea,<br /><br />and his boots leak.<br /><br />Maryann was absent December 11-16 because she had a fever,<br /><br />sore throat, headache, and upset stomach. Her sister was also sick--fever and sore throat--and her brother had a low-grade fever and ached all over. I wasn't the best either--sore throat and fever. There must be the flu going around school. Her father even got hot last night.<br /><br />[court Q-and-A]<br /><br />Q: Where do you live?<br /><br />A: 2442 Oseawotamire Street<br /><br />Q: How do you spell that street?<br /><br />A: S-T-R-E-E-T<br /><br />* In one edition of today's food section, an inaccurate number of jalapeno peppers was given for Jeanette Crowley's southwestern chicken salad recipe.

HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo is not just for women . . . though subtitled THE NO-EXCUSES TRUTH TO UNDERSTANDING GUYS, men<br /><br />will find a lot of useful advice here too.<br /><br />And both sexes will come to a better understanding as to how their interpersonal communication can be improved.<br /><br />I liked the approach that was used; i.e., the authors responded to a series of letters . . . in doing so, they gave practical suggestions that not only make sense . . . they also work.<br /><br />In addition, I found myself agreeing with many of the poll statistics that were cited; e.g., 100% of men polled said they've never been too busy to call a woman they were really into. As one fine man said, \\"A man has got to have his priorities.\\"<br /><br />Also valuable was the accompanying workbook that was at the end of each chapter . . . one of the best assignments was this one:<br /><br />If you're in a relationship that you suspect is not good for you, but you're not sure, do this simple exercise:<br /><br />Take out a tape recorder. Tell the story of your relationship into it. Play it out loud. Imagine that your best friend in the whole world is telling you the story instead of you. Would you want better for her?<br /><br />If it's impossible for you to think you deserve better, try to at least believe one of your friends who thinks you deserve better . . . just long enough to get you out of the relationship.	2005-06-17

You've just got to love a book by a guy who describes himself as \\"a passionate simpleton and an outspoken gadfly against corporate stupidity\\" . . . Bill Jensen, author of a marvelous<br /><br />book--WHAT IS YOUR LIFE'S WORK?--also adds that his personal life fantasy is \\"to bicycle around the globe via breweries.\\"<br /><br />Jensen has captured the intimate exchanges between mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, and others to help determine what really matters at work and in life . . . he then shows you how you can pay this information forward; i.e., by starting a similar conversation with a loved one.<br /><br />I was moved by many of the observations that I read . . . however, this one in particular caught my attention: \\"My daughter was limp with pain . . . and I'm worried about deadlines. What was I thinking?!?!\\"<br /><br />The book contained several other memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />* The kids you didn't like from high school are still around, and many of them work in advertising. There are also some really wonderfully talented people. You will have to work with all of them, so try to have an open mind. Find something to like about everyone and hold on to that. Hitler liked dogs. Perhaps young Stalin had a pony. Lucrezia Borgia was good at chemistry. Dig deep; you can do it.<br /><br />* Countless numbers of coworkers have told me that I had the best job in the company (I have held nine different positions and have heard this through all of them). Why is this? Because I enjoyed every position I held and made it mine. I made it something I loved to do.<br /><br />The coworkers saw my smiling face, my laughs, and my positive attitude. They didn't see me working until three in the morning to make a deadline, or pulling a week of all-nighters. The saw someone who loved what he did.<br /><br />* So . . . comes my veritas. To endure, an intelligent, aware, passionate teacher, you must:<br /><br />Know yourself and how you fit into the system--square pegs can find square holes.<br /><br />Choose your issues, where you can preserve your integrity.<br /><br />Keep reading, learning, doing, even when others don't.<br /><br />Love passionately what you do with children.<br /><br />Learn to do new methods subversively.<br /><br />Document everything, especially your programs.<br /><br />Be your own cheering section--external sources are very unreliable.<br /><br />Seek mental help if you feel yourself burning out.

A reader suggested that I might enjoy MATZO BALLS FOR BREAKFAST AND OTHER MEMORIES OF GROWING UP JEWISH by Alan King, the great comedian who conceived and developed the book in the period before he died in 2004.<br /><br />She was wrong, I loved MATZO BALLS (almost as much as the actual food product).<br /><br />It is a series of essays written by famous people--many of them entertainers--about what being Jewish is all about . . . they range from Neil Sedaka writing about not becoming a cantor to Melissa Manchester describing how she came to find her way to the<br /><br />father . . . in a final section, Rick Moranis, Barbara Walters and Billy Crystal recall the Alan King they knew so well and laughed with so often.<br /><br />And don't feel you have to be Jewish to enjoy this material . . . regardless of your religion, it will move you at times . . . and make you smile, at others, as a result of gentle humor such as this tale from Barry Louis Polisar (a four-time Parent's Choice Award winner for his<br /><br />books and music for children):<br /><br />My grandmother used to tell me a story that her father, Louis, used to tell about God giving the Jewish people religion. \\"It's really not such a hard religion,\\" God said. \\"Here, I'll write it down for you. You try it for a while, and if it doesn't suit you, bring it back.\\" So the Jewish<br /><br />people tried it and found it was not too hard. For days, caravan upon caravan stretched across the desert carrying Haftorahs, mezuzahs, yarmulkes, prayer shawls, commentaries, and prayer books. God looked out at the caravans that stretched to the horizon and said,<br /><br />\\"What's all this? All I wrote down for you were ten simple commandments.\\"<br /><br />Uri Geller contributed his favorite Alan King joke:<br /><br />Mrs. Cohen is yelling at the lifeguard who just pulled her husband out of the ocean. He tells her is going to give artificial respiration. She yells back, \\"You'll ever give my Benny real respiration or nothing!\\"<br /><br />There are also a series of wonderful quotes throughout the book, including these I particularly liked:<br /><br />The most remarkable thing about my mother is that for thirty years she served the family nothing but leftovers. The original meal has never been found.--Calvin Trillin<br /><br />If only God would give me some clear sign!

Some books grab you by the title . . . that was certainly the case with THE BEST TIME TO DO EVERYTHING by Michael Kaplan, a journalist who is the gambling columnist for CIGAR AFICIONADO.<br /><br />The subtitle caught my attention, too: EXPERT ADVICE ON HOW TO LIVE COOLER, SMARTER, FASTER, BETTER . . . being interested in all those possibilities, I read this book's 170 too-brief pages in one sitting.<br /><br />Some of what I learned wasn't all that practical; OK, OK, not practical at all--such as how to stage a coup . . . I also wasn't very interested in such other topics as the best time to deliver<br /><br />a baby, get punched in the face or sweat a perp.<br /><br />However, I found much of the other advice both interesting and helpful (either now or in the future) . . . for example, as a result of reading Kaplan's work, I now know the best time to downsize, pick up a lunch or dinner tab and thank your parents.<br /><br />This latter bit of advice rally struck a chord . . . according to Mary Marcadante, author of MY MOTHER, MY FRIEND: THE TEN MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO TALK ABOUT WITH YOUR MOTHER and one of the many experts interviewed in the book:<br /><br />\\"There are no times soon enough to tell our parents how grateful we are for their raising us. . . . I told my parents [recently] that I am glad to be alive, and I thanked them for the gift of life. I pointed out a few details--like the fact that my father used to take me to skip stones--and they helped my parents to recall some great memories. It's the sort of thing that rejuvenates you and them.\\"<br /><br />Among just a few of the many other tidbits that I found useful were the following:<br /><br />Auto prices are always somewhat negotiable, but at the end of every month, salesmen become downright flexible. It's when they focus more on volume and less on commissions from individual car sales. \\"We have monthly quotas that we try to hit,\\" says Fred Altman, one<br /><br />of America's most successful Dodge salesmen (he works out of Christopher's Dodge World in Golden, Colorado, which consistently ranks among the country's top dealerships). \\"Everything in the car business is on a monthly schedule.

BETWEEN A ROCK AND HARD PLACE, read and written by Aron Ralston, is the thrilling true tale of a hiker who had to amputate his arm in order to survive . . . while that may sound<br /><br />gruesome to many, Alston makes it sound almost matter-of-fact as the result of his firsthand account that still amazes me now several days after having heard it . . . I also liked the description of the manhunt that his friends and relatives undertook in an attempt to find him . . . the fact that he has since resumed mountain climbing--and the description of his battle to regain his health--make this book truly inspirational for those having to face uphill struggles<br /><br />of their own.	2005-05-15

There's a lot of good information in MIDLIFE MELTDOWN by Janet Maccaro, a book designed especially for anybody born between 1946 and 1964 . . . since I fall in that category, I decided to read the book per the recommendation of a friend.<br /><br />Section One helps the reader understand midlife meltdown, then Section Two provided help for specific conditions of midlife meltdown . . . these range from aging to periodontal health and include such other topics as menopause, natural prostate protection, weight management, arthritis, brain health, and some 20 others.<br /><br />Each chapter is short, as well as very easy to understand . . . my only criticism is that Maccaro suggests a lot of supplements to take . . . if you were to take all of them, you'd be both broke and bloated (as a result of all the water you'd be drinking to just swallow all the pills and capsules).<br /><br />There were several memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />* What is a meltdown? Quite simply, a meltdown occurs during midlife when internal stress and external pressures become so intense that life offers little or no joy. Physical symptoms such as overwhelming fatigue and lethargy are a constant battle, enthusiasm of things once<br /><br />cherished is diminished, hope is dashed, uncertainty is plentiful, and a freefall occurs as our \\"safety net\\" of invincible youth gives way.<br /><br />* Midlife can be a turning point for those who will use it as such. It is the time of life to take inventory of your life. It is the time to pay attention to the whispers that have been alerting you of the imbalances in your professional, personal, and family life as well as your physical,<br /><br />emotional, and even your financial health. It is a time to put your hands back on the wheel in terms of your life's course. It is a time to reflect on the past and what you have learned from it. It is the time to get rid of any baggage you are still toting on this earthly journey that may be weighing you down, such as debt, unforgiveness, anger, and personal relationships that take all your energy and rob you of being all you were meant to be.<br /><br />* It has been shown that during midlife, many marriages fail because one or both spouses fail to meet the other's emotional needs. That is understandable, given the huge amount of stress and responsibility tat often occurs during midlife. Couples may neglect to schedule time with one another. Their relationship is not a high priority. It is often replaced by activities of lesser importance, such as career, home maintenance, and financial worries.<br /><br />Your marriage can be a \\"lifetime love affair.\\" Protect it be setting time aside each week to give each other undivided attention and appreciation. Pray together, stay together, go the distance together. Happily married couples fare better at midlife that singles because of the<br /><br />important emotional connection and shared interests.

Kiyosaki, but to date, had never read any of them . . . so when I saw the cassette version of RICH DAD'S SUCCESS<br /><br />STORIES by Kiyosaki with Sharon L. Lechter, I started listening to it with some degree of interest.<br /><br />Billed as \\"real life success stories from real life people who followed the rich dad lessons,\\" I enjoyed hearing how a diverse range of folks took the lessons they learned and made<br /><br />money from them . . . one key seems to be that if you made up your mind what to do, carry it out right away (just don't sit on it and do nothing).<br /><br />It got me thinking that if you can replace salary with passive income, that's certainly one thing to consider--seriously . . . for example, borrow money to buy assets . . . in other words, take out a mortgage on a house you want to rent out and have somebody else, the renter, buy it back.<br /><br />Another idea I loved: Take advice from rich people, not salespeople!<br /><br />There were many other noteworthy tidbits; among them:<br /><br />To keep watch on your investments, make sure you tour your properties every 3-4 months. Meet with the property managers. See what needs to be done, walk through all vacancies, review work that has to be done, and any other concerns involving the building.<br /><br />Use a team of advisers to provide you with the information you need to make decisions and to act upon them.<br /><br />Success equals 1 part knowledge or lessons learned, 1 part information or lessons learned by others and shared, and risk.	2005-05-11

They're all symptoms of hormone imbalance that can affect women from adolescence through menopause, according<br /><br />to Dr. Erika Schwartz in THE HORMONE SOLUTION--an excellent book that I recommend for both sexes.<br /><br />I know it opened my eyes to many things; in particular, the fact that men can have many of these same symptoms . . . and actually go through something called andropause (or male menopause, if you want to think of it in those terms).<br /><br />The good news is that that help is available; i.e., through the use of natural hormones derived from soy and yams . . . Dr. Schwartz stated prescribing these natural forms of estrogen and progesterone for herself and her patients, and the results have been nothing short<br /><br />of amazing.<br /><br />THE HORMONE SOLUTION takes a complex issue that has only recently been addressed by the medical community and addresses it in a simple, understandable book that could well be used as a guide for many readers and/or their loved ones . . . in addition, it is a work<br /><br />that others may well want to discuss with their doctors.<br /><br />There were several memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />What I had not realized before was that all these hormone imbalances are connected and could be treated successfully with natural hormone supplementation. The more women of different ages and different symptoms came to see me, the more convinced I became of the continuum of hormone changes we are subjected to at all ages. Natural hormone treatment was invariably successful and had none of the side effects associated with other types of<br /><br />medications. That was because natural hormones treated the root cause of the problems with substances closely resembling the missing or out-of-balance hormones our bodies make. There was no potentially harmful, synthetic substances in this hormone<br /><br />supplementation program.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the medical profession has not been keen on  addressing this obvious similarity to female menopause. Most doctors are men, and menopause does not have a pretty ring to it--it's about aging. And men are more afraid than women to address the inevitability of this process. Men pride themselves on the ability to father children into their eighties, so how could they be having the same problems as again women? (The truth,<br /><br />by the way, is that men who father children naturally in their eighties are as rare as women who give birth in their fifties.)<br /><br />All scientists agree: Hormones are the common thread that makes up the fabric of our lives. They define us as men and women when we're young, they keep us healthy or make us<br /><br />sick, and yet the understanding we have of them is vague, contradictory, and inconsistent. . . . Unequivocally, the scientific community knows that hormone levels change every minute of<br /><br />the day, so why get hung up on one or two changes: menopause and puberty? A small step for science, a giant step for women. Once you make that connection, once you identify the<br /><br />continuum of hormone changes, menopause is a lot less scary, and its devastation just another mountain to scale.n this hormone <br />supplementation program. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the medical profession has not been keen on  addressing this obvious similarity to female menopause.

I've enjoyed all of Donald Trump's other books, and so when I saw his latest--TRUMP: THINK LIKE A BILLIONAIRE--written with Meredith McIver, I knew that this just had to be the title that was for me . . . I mean, who wouldn't be interested in not only the title, but by a subtitle that held even more promise:<br /><br />EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SUCCESS, REAL ESTATE AND LIFE.<br /><br />Sadly, I was disappointed after this quick reading effort . . . it seems to have been thrown together without much thought except to present a whole bunch of ideas and write about them in short paragraphs that don't hold much substance.<br /><br />To cite one example: Trump dangles the promise of the secret behind what he calls his Mar-a-Lago diet . . . save the $21.95 purchase price since I'll give it here:<br /><br />1. It [food] has to be served in a fantastic setting.<br /><br />2. It has to look fantastic.<br /><br />3. It has to look incredible.<br /><br />4. It cannot make you gain weight.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but the above tells me very little about what I would need to do if I wanted to follow the actual diet.<br /><br />Yet with almost anything, if you dig long enough, you can find at least something of value . . . and that said, I did manage to walk away with these tidbits:<br /><br />I can understand why some people would appreciate the convenience of ATM cards, but a lot of other tech devices are completely unnecessary and get in the way of human contact. If you have something important to say, look the person in the eye and say it. And if you can't get there, pick up the phone and make sure they hear the sincerity in your voice. E-mail is for wimps.<br /><br />Pay attention to words like \\"funky\\" and \\"charming,\\" which you can translate as \\"unlivable\\" and \\"run-down.\\" Ads that brag \\"newly renovated\\" usually mean that the landlord has simply slapped new knobs on the bathroom cabinets. Other phrases that should make you nervous include \\"old-world appeal\\" (read: \\"dilapidated\\"), \\"cozy\\" (read: \\"tiny\\"), and \\"freshly painted\\" (read: \\"There's nothing good to say about the apartment except that is has a fresh coat of paint\\"). Anything that sounds too good to be true is-especially when it comes to apartments.<br /><br />Always get references from contractors. Ask the contractor to give you ten names of other jobs they have done within the last year. Jobs that they did four or five years ago are not good measures; the jobs need to be recent. And don't ask for just two names; ask for the full ten. It's easy to make two parties happy, but only a great contractor can make ten<br /><br />parties happy.<br /><br />A final part of the book promised a look \\"Inside the Apprentice\\" . . .

Heard the cassette version of WHERE THE RIGHT WENT WRONG, written and read by Patrick J. Buchanan . . . though I don't ordinarily see myself as a conservative, I do like learning about all political viewpoints . . . and this book certainly opened my eyes to some things about our current foreign policy that even staunch Republicans find puzzling, such as (to quote the author): \\"In 2003, the US invaded a country that did not threaten us, and did not war with us, to disarm it of weapons we have since discovered it did not have.\\" . . . I don't know about you, but that bothers me every time I hear of the death of even just one Iraqi or American citizen . . . Buchanan presents lots of other thought-provoking criticisms of Bush policies on terrorism, imperialism, the Middle East, free trade, and the deficit . . . I found that all interesting . . . yet Buchanan does not stop there . . . he also takes on liberals with his stand against immigration, affirmative action, abortion, and gay rights . . . you may not agree with all of WHERE THE RIGHT WENT WRONG; however, it will make definitely make<br /><br />you ponder about what is happening in the world.	2005-04-29

Buy 100 stamped postcards. For the next month, each time you receive a piece of junk mail from an outfit that has frequently contacted you, send its employees a postcard pointing out that they're wasting money and asking to be removed from their mailing list. If the junkmail<br /><br />contains a 1-800 number or an e-mail address, use these means to contact them as well. Some businesses will ignore your request and continue to send you unwanted mail, but others will get the message. Dump all junk mail into the recycle bin as soon as it comes in the door.<br /><br />If they're on the floor, put them in the hamper. If they're in the hamper, put them in the laundry baskets. If they're in the laundry baskets, put them in the washer. If they're in the washer, put them in the dryer. If they're in the dryer, hang them on the line or fold them and put them back in the laundry baskets. If they're on the line or in the laundry baskets,<br /><br />put them in the closets and the drawers. Clothes that get stuck somewhere<br /><br />in the laundry cycle create big mounds of clothes clutter, all of which can be easily removed. Just keep the clothes moving until they're all back in the closets and drawers and watch the piles disappear.<br /><br />When you're ready to sort, stand next to a recycle bin and toss everything useless into it. Don't bother to open envelopes if you're really sure they're junk mail. Then divide what's left into three piles: items to send or give to somebody else, action items and file items. Get rid of the Send/Give pile ASAP by mailing or handling papers over to their proper recipients. Meanwhile, put the File items--papers you want to put away--in a to-file box. Its size depends on how often you're able to file and how many papers you typically have.

I've long been a fan of Julie Morgenstern . . . her other books, ORGANIZING FROM THE INSIDE OUT and TIME MANAGEMENT FORM THE INSIDE OUT, had a big impact on me--and contained much useful information that I still use.<br /><br />So it was with great anticipation that I obtained and devoured her latest, MAKING WORK WORK . . . it did not disappoint!<br /><br />Morgenstern presents ideas and suggestions that apply to just about any situation . . . what she writes may sound basic, but it is the type thing that you need to read more than once . . . then begin to use.<br /><br />For example, she urges you to begin conversations with:<br /><br />\\"What can I do for you?\\" not \\"How are you?\\" As she notes:<br /><br />\\"How are you?\\" is an open invitation to chat and warm up. \\"What can I do for you?\\" immediately focuses your interrupter on getting straight to the point. It's professional and gets you both down to business. This enables you to handle the interruption in the least amount of time possible.<br /><br />There were several other memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />The only real chance you have at choosing the most important tasks begins with keeping a complete list of everything you need to do in one place. After all, prioritizing is a matter of relativity--the true question is, What's most important in relation to the other things on your list? Taken one item at a time, everything can mask itself as a critical task.<br /><br />Control Lateness: Use odd start times, such as 27 or 41 minutes after the hour, to control lateness. People are far less likely to be late for a meeting that starts at 11:27 than one at 11:30. Designate an official timekeeper to watch the clock for every meeting, and rotate that role among attendees. It's their responsibility to regulate the meeting so it doesn't go overtime, and they'll have an invested interest in doing a good job-they could be on the other side of the clock the next time around.<br /><br />Change \\"but\\" to \\"and.\\" What a difference a word makes, implying a can-do, take-charge approach to problems rather than an argument. For example, a client tells you they want to bring the budget down. Instead of saying, \\"But that's going to compromise quality,\\" try saying, \\"Okay, and that's likely to compromise quality. Where would you be most comfortable shaving costs?\\" Or you boss asks you to have something on his desk in two hours. Instead of saying, \\"But then I won't be able to meet tomorrow's deadline,\\" try, \\"Okay, and if I need to do that, what should I do about tomorrow's deadline? Can someone else finish it off?\\" Focus on solutions, not obstacles.fference a word makes, implying a can-do, take-charge approach to problems rather than an argument.

I've never watched Joel Osteen, senior pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas, on any of his television broadcasts that are watched by millions . . . furthermore, I am not of the same religious persuasion that he is . . . however, neither fact mattered as I got much out of YOUR BEST LIFE NOW--his excellent book.<br /><br />Reading it reminded me of the first time I came across Norman Vincent Peale . . . there were too many references to both Christ and the Bible in THE POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING,<br /><br />yet I managed to gloss over them and got a great deal out of reading that particular book . . . I think that's going to be the case with YOUR BEST LIFE NOW; i.e., it has much to<br /><br />offer me . . . and it is something that can't fully be absorbed with just one reading, so I believe I'll want to refer to it quite often.<br /><br />As Osteen notes, your journey to a brighter future begins with seven steps:<br /><br />One: Enlarge your vision.<br /><br />Two: Develop a healthy self-image.<br /><br />Three: Discover the power of your thoughts and words.<br /><br />Four: Let go of the past.<br /><br />Five: Find strength through adversity.<br /><br />Six: Live to give.<br /><br />Seven: Choose to be happy.<br /><br />He goes on to give lots of examples for each step, including many from his own personal background.<br /><br />Also, I liked many of the passages; these three stand out:<br /><br />Every single day, a husband should tell his wife, \\"I love you. I appreciate you. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.\\" A wife should do the same for her husband. Your relationship would improve immensely if you'd simply start speaking kind, positive words, blessing your spouse instead of cursing him or her.<br /><br />\\"Do you know that no matter how big your problem is today, somebody else had a bigger problem, a tougher road, a more heartrending story than yours? You can help make a difference in somebody's life. You can help ease somebody's burden. You can cheer somebody up, and give somebody a fresh new hope.\\"<br /><br />One of the healthiest things you can do is learn to smile more often.

Heard RETURN TO LOVE, a cassette program written and read by Marianne Williamson . . . it contained her reflections on the principles of A COURSE IN MIRACLES, and though I've<br /><br />not yet gone through that latter work, I feel as if I've already gotten great benefit from it because of Williamson's enthusiasm for the subject matter.<br /><br />In these tapes, she discusses the principles and practices of miracles, as well as what we need to do to allow them (and love) into our lives.<br /><br />I also enjoyed learning about Williamson's background and how she came to embrace A COURSE IN MIRACLES, though she was born Jewish . . . in fact, what I got out of listening:<br /><br />the material applies to any religion . . . for example:<br /><br />The internal equivalent to oxygen is love. Without love, we'll all die.<br /><br />Ask yourself: Do you prefer to be right or happy?<br /><br />God doesn't need us to police the universe.<br /><br />There's enough room for everyone to be rich. It is only our thinking which blocks that possibility for manifestation.<br /><br />Whatever we focus on, we're going to get more of it. Think lack, and we get lack. Think abundance, and we get abundance.<br /><br />You don't have to be a virtuoso in everything. You do need to seek to become a virtuoso in life.<br /><br />In heaven, everyone is allowed to be successful.<br /><br />The important thing about our past is not what happened, but what we did with what happened.<br /><br />What did we learn from what we did yesterday?

In his entertaining and informative book, CHARMING YOUR WAY TO THE TOP, Michael Levine defines charm as \\"the act of making the other person believe you care\\" . . . he then goes on to present countless examples of how this can be done in a wide variety of situations.<br /><br />Levine, who heads his own public relations firm, also mentions names of people who have and haven't used charm in their careers . . . my only regret is that he hadn't mentioned both<br /><br />Cary Grant and Adolph Hitler quite so much and instead had cited his actual clients more.<br /><br />Yet that said, I still liked CHARMING and got much out of it . . . you will, too . . . for example, here were just a few of the ideas that caught my attention:<br /><br />The most obvious way to ingratiate yourself to other people is to demonstrate interest in them. Women often complain that first dates are awful because the men they date rarely want to talk about anything but themselves. Listening as well as talking is a severely under-practiced skill and one that needs to be cultivated and used intelligently. It is simple and basic, but it is also true--we want people to listen to us.<br /><br />Light conversation is a skill and an art--it requires a little thought, and quick reactions. But it is not difficult and it is not dangerous. Asking people how their day is going is a simple and quick way to start a conversation, and-especially-to demonstrate that you are interested in them, in their feelings and problems, at least on a very limited basis. I'm not talking about the robotic \\"have-a-nice-day\\" kind of communication that is clearly rehearsed and insincere.<br /><br />In this case, the easiest thing at the dry cleaner, the supermarket, the restaurant, or the bookstore is simply to look the person behind the counter in the eye, smile, and ask, \\"How's your day going?\\"<br /><br />Also, using that technique [using someone's name] when leaving voice mail or telephone answering machine messages is a very telling, important point. Yes, identify yourself, but make sure you speak directly to the person for whom you're leaving the message, and use his name. It shows that even during unguarded moments you are thinking of someone other than yourself.elling, important point.

I rarely read a book after I've seen a movie, but I made an exception for PAY IT FORWARD by Catherine Ryan Hyde . . . and I'm glad I did, in that the book (as is usually the case) was far superior to the movie.<br /><br />It is a novel about a 12-year-old boy in a California town who accepts the challenge that his teacher gives the class; i.e., for extra credit, come up with a plan to make the world a better place--then implement the plan.<br /><br />He decides to choose three people for whom he will do a favor, and when those people thank him and ask him how to repay the favor, he will ask them to \\"pay it forward\\" by doing favors for three more people . . . in essence, the boy attempts to create a human chain letter of kindness that sounds great in theory yet seems to fall apart at every step . . . or so it appears.<br /><br />This is a story that grew on me as I got more into it . . . there were several diverse subplots that all seemed to come together, thanks to masterful writing by the author . . . I was moved by it and think you will be, too.<br /><br />Among the many memorable passages were the following:<br /><br />The most important thing I can add from my own observations is this:<br /><br />knowing it started from unremarkable circumstances should be a comfort to us all. Because it proves that you don't need much to change the entire world for the better. You can start with the most ordinary ingredients. You can start with the world you've got.<br /><br />\\"You don't think it up with imagination. You just look around. Until you see somebody who needs something.\\"<br /><br />October 19, 1992. It's one of those dates you don't forget. In fact, you don't forget anything about it. You remember the jingle that was playing on the television. You remember the thought that was spinning around in your head a split second beforehand, when everything<br /><br />was still in order. It's trite to say, but your life divides up into before and after, and you don't have trouble placing things in time anymore. You can almost date the thing, something like B.C. and A.D. I guess it sounds like I'm wasting a lot of time feeling sorry for myself. I won't lie. I haven't completely let go of it. In some ways I have. Not all ways. I'm probably being too sensitive. Maybe other people's wounds heal in a reasonable space of time.ouble placing things in time anymore. You can almost date the thing, something like B.C. and A.D.

As unbelievable as it may sound, I'm in my fifties--and still doing well (at least in my opinion) . . . yet that said, I sometimes find myself with questions about my health and in need of answers, I seek them out via the Internet, friends, doctors, etc.<br /><br />So I was delighted to come across FACING YOUR FIFTIES by Dr. Gordon Ehlers and Jeff Miller . . . it is much of the information that I've been seeking--all in one handy reference<br /><br />guide that is written with a minimum of medical jargon.<br /><br />I recommend it not only for any guy in the 40-60 age range, in addition to their wives or significant others . . . you'll of course find information on cancer and heart disease, in addition to some unexpected though most helpful advice on how to pick shoes . . . I particularly liked these two suggestions:<br /><br />* Try on shoes at the end of the day, when your feet are<br /><br />the largest; and<br /><br />* Uncomfortable shoes in the store will stay that way, even<br /><br />with \\"breaking in.\\"<br /><br />There were many other useful tidbits; among them:<br /><br />For prevention, two good examples of stacking the odds in your favor are: (1) taking eighty-one milligrams of aspirin (a \\"baby\\" aspirin) daily; and (2) taking 400 IU (international units) of vitamin E daily. How likely is it that taking aspirin will cause a problem for most people? Not very. How likely is it that taking vitamin E will cause a problem for anyone?  Not likely. But both help to significantly reduce the risk of a fifties male suffering a heart attack or stroke. In these two cases, the benefits far outweigh the effort and affects of taking the pills.<br /><br />If the alarm clock is waking you from a deep sleep, and you're overly tired in the early afternoon, and you can't shake that midday fatigue, then you need to adjust your schedule to create a better sleep pattern. Working in fifteen or twenty-minute increments, start by giving<br /><br />yourself one more increment of sleep. Try it for a week or so. If this doesn't create the desired results, add another increment and then another until you find the optimum amount of sleep you need. Once you determine that, you can easily figure out when you need to go<br /><br />to bed to obtain that amount of sleep-and still get to work on time.<br /><br />Finally, one last piece of advice--maybe the best piece of advice in this entire book. Once you've had a physical assessment, once you've taken the preventive exams and tests, once you've implemented a sound, life-long program of good eating, exercise, and periodic physician visits, then remember: Don't obsess about your health Simply live your life to the fullest.Try it for a week or so.

SMALL GRACES by writer, sculptor and theologian Kent Nerburn caught me off guard . . . I wasn't expecting much from this short book of 20 essays, but as I got more into it, the more I was impressed with both its beauty and simplicity.<br /><br />It made me think about moments in my life that I thought were ordinary--yet, in reality, are much more than that . . . as Nerburn notes, \\"We become artists when we see with our hearts instead of our eyes\\" . . . methinks that this is something that we all need to do, regardless of profession.<br /><br />I find myself reflecting about one section, in particular . . . the author describes a teenager's anguish about having to walk around on crutches for a relatively short period of her life (because of an accident) . . . she naturally finds it upsetting, yet it also helps come to the realization that she'll never again complain when she comes across an older person walking slowly.<br /><br />There were several memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />* She smiles, helps Nick with his knife. In Japan, one who masters the gentle art of making tea can be declared a national treasure. I watch her hold his hand gently in hers. Should one who practices the gentle arts of making a home be revered any less?<br /><br />* \\"No, your life isn't ruined. Now your life is your life. No one else can fix it or change it. No one else can be blamed. This is yours. And it is up to you what you will make of it.\\"<br /><br />* None of us is promised tomorrow. Today, in all its beauty and sadness and complexity, is all we have. This light we see may be the last such day we have on this earth. There is no certainty, beyond the fact that one day we will have no tomorrow, and that it is not ours to know when that day will be.<br /><br />Powerful stuff!<br /><br />And so, too, is the conclusion:<br /><br />* Sometimes, it seems, we ask too much. Sometimes we forget that the small graces are enough.<br /><br />I'll cherish SMALL GRACES for a long time and will want it to share it with others . . . you'll want to do the same if you give it a shot.time and will want it to share it with others . . . you'll want to do the same if you give it a shot.	2005-03-01

If you do, it will break you down, and you won't have longevity because you'll be freaked out about the things you've done. You must not be afraid to say no if you're uncomfortable with something. It's nice to bring someone with you, be it a girl or guy, to help you hold your ground.<br /><br />* Then pick a name. Don't use another star in the industry's moniker, like so many other girls do for some reason Pick a name that's original and not cheesy. A classy name like Julia Ann will take you farther than a cheesy one like Craven Booty. Next, make sure you register or buy the Internet domain name for your pseudonym before someone else does.<br /><br />* Question: What do I have to do to date you?<br /><br />Answer (Good Mood): It's all about confidence.

Even if you're not \\"into\\" politics, there's much in POLITICKING by Bill Rauch that can be enjoyed . . . he's a former advance man for Ed Koch who is now mayor of Beaufort, South Carolina.<br /><br />He provides much practical advice on what is needed to get elected at any level, but in doing so, he also gives you insight on how to run a meeting, work a room, deal with negative press<br /><br />coverage, how to look good on camera, etc. . . . I know that I took lots of notes and plan to use some of them in my teaching . . . also, I've already shared many of the ideas with friends (both politicians and those in the business world).<br /><br />For example, there's this useful technique for generating applause when speaking:<br /><br />Here's a Lee Atwater trick that's worth trying if you've got an energized group of core supporters and election day's approaching. Nothing looks better on TV than you with 150 Kiwanians standing and cheering you. But how do you get them out of their seats?<br /><br />First, write a speech that builds up to and then ends with your announcing something that's news and that the community wants, say a new football stadium for the high school or a new parking facility downtown. You don't have to say you've got the money, just that you favor the new project and you'll work to make it happen. Practice the speech until you know it's good. Then make sure the TV camera crews are in the back of the room. Tell them there'll be news in your speech that they won't want to miss, but don't tell them what it is or they may not come to find out. Get as many of your people into the room as you can, but-this is the<br /><br />Atwater part-position ten or twelve of your most reliable supporters throughout the room as if you're the batter and they're the fielders in a baseball game, with a \\"pitcher\\" at front row center. Cue your team, especially the pitcher, to the applause line at the end of the speech,<br /><br />telling them, \\"When I get to the applause line, get up and start clapping hard as soon as the pitcher gets up.\\" It will amaze you to see all the other Kiwanians rising with them. And the footage of the crowd standing and clapping as you humbly sit down after concluding your remarks will be irresistible to the editors back at the TV stations' cutting rooms.<br /><br />There were several other valuable tidbits of information; among them:<br /><br />The next step--and here's one of the many places organizational ability, hard work, and people skills pay off--is to either call or preferably go see each of these people. Most people find it vastly easier to say no to a voice on the phone than to a person sitting in their living room. So whenever possible, go see your prospective committee members in their homes. When you get there, don't be shy. Pitch the wife. Pitch the kids. Pitch the mother-in-law. Tell the son that you're running and how important his father's support is to your candidacy. Watch the movie Primary Colors and learn from the Bill Clinton character. The ability to make an ordinary person  feel extraordinary is a high political art. If you weren't born with this<br /><br />talent, seek to acquire it. An ordinary ego can be intoxicated by flattery, and an intoxicated ego will pledge things that defy rationality. In this way you can build something from nothing.<br /><br />In the six weeks before election day, candidates in local races should spend the hour or so they are allocated in public forums talking about how they will improve the lives of their constituents. They may also spend a few minutes speaking of what good they've already done, and briefly outlining any other personal qualifications that might get them some votes. Under no circumstances should a candidate in a local race disparage one of his or her opponents at a forum or in a debate. Likewise, badmouthing opponents to reporters should be avoided. No matter how delicately it can be done, bad- mouthing comes off a nasty.<br /><br />In mysix years as a city council-member, I was careful t be nonpartisan. I avoided party functions, which saved a lot of time too. Where I made campaign contributions or appearances, I tried to support candidates form both parties. My line was: \\"I know al these people.

For a \\"no,\\" use the phone.<br /><br />Then there were these other passages that also got me thinking:<br /><br />* William C. Byham, chairman and CEO of Development Dimensions<br /><br />International, Inc.:<br /><br />Early in my career, I worked at the world headquarters of JC Penney. One of the senior executives there had a test through which he put all major decisions: \\"What would be the best thing that could happen from this decision and what  would be the worst thing that could<br /><br />happen from this decision?\\" I observed him go through the analysis generated by this test many times and I was impressed enough to adopt it myself. It has served me well. Often I have identified a public relations problem or a key client risk that outweighs the minor benefit<br /><br />which would come from a particular action.<br /><br />* George G. Gellert, chairman of Atlanta Corporation:<br /><br />When I visited Taiwan many years ago, the person taking me around town was introduced to me as a chauffeur. Nonetheless, I enjoyed his company very much and I was very pleased with him. That evening, through a more skilled translator, I discovered that he was actually the owner of the company I had visited. That was the beginning of a great business relationship, and a great illustration of the best business advice I have ever received: whenever you meet somebody, whatever his or her position may be, be gracious and<br /><br />friendly because you never know.<br /><br />* Guy Oseary, copartner and CEO of Maverick Recording Company:<br /><br />When I was nineteen, I complained to David Geffen about some other people I the entertainment business who were making a lot of money and who I didn't think deserved it. David turned to me and said,\\" You need to be a racehorse. Do you know what racehorses<br /><br />do?\\" I answered, \\"They race.\\" David replied, \\"No, they wear blinders! If they looked to the left or right, they would lose. Don't look to the left and don't look to the right. Wear blinders and race your  own race!\\"m.

You had to be there to see what it looked like. They live in a dream, and we live in a nightmare.\\"<br /><br />[Walter Winchell, speaking to nearly ten thousand people]<br /><br />\\"The Hitlerites can take away my radio microphone, and they've done just that, as you know. They can take away my newspaper column, and they have done that, as you know. And when, God forbid, America goes fascist, Lindbergh's storm troopers can lock me away in a concentration camp to shut me up--and they will do that too, as you know. They can even lock you away in a concentration camp to shut you up. And I hope by now that you damn well know that. But what our homegrown Hitlerites cannot take away is my love for America and yours.

Heard the taped version of LITTLE EARTHQUAKES, written and read by Jennifer Weiner . . . her first novel, GOOD IN BED, blew me away . . . I also liked her follow-up, IN HER SHOES . . . this latest one didn't disappoint, either.<br /><br />It is a novel about four very different women who all face a similar situation; i.e., new motherhood . . . I felt like I got to know each one and, in doing so, I grew to care for them--and their children . . . their husbands were well drawn too, ranging from a basketball superstar to an unemployed husband.<br /><br />There were moments when I laughed about what these women were going through (including one having to deal with a mother-in-law from hell), yet I was also moved by their lives.	2005-01-28

Heard THE NINE FANTASIES THAT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE AND THE EIGHT REALITIES THAT WILL SAVE YOU, written and read by Dr. Joy Brown . . . she's a radio talk show, as well as a licensed clinical psychologist.<br /><br />I have occasionally heard her on the radio and when I have, I've been impressed with her no-nonsense approach to giving advice . . . she rarely gives sympathy; rather, she gives useful suggestions that apply to marriage, personal relationships, career, finances, health,<br /><br />and all other aspects of your life.<br /><br />Here, she first presents the fantasies . . . among the ones that most caught my attention were the following:<br /><br />There's no place like home.<br /><br />We all assume that everybody else's family is terrific and ours is dysfunctional. Don't believe it for a minute.<br /><br />Winning the lottery will free me. If money were the key to happiness, millionaires wouldn't have ulcers. They do and it's not.<br /><br />Good always triumphs.<br /><br />Life isn't fair. Get used to it. Do the best with what you've got. And no whining.<br /><br />Dr. Brown then discusses the realities of life . . . these made the most sense to me:<br /><br />Never tell someone something they already know. Compliment people sincerely and keep nasty thoughts to yourself.<br /><br />We're responsible for our behavior; feelings just happen. Everybody has bad thoughts. It's bad behavior that separates the good guys from the bad guys.<br /><br />Romance is the poison of the twentieth century. Unrealistic expectations mean never being satisfied with what you've got, and romance is the ultimate unrealistic expectation.<br /><br />Reader letters, read and answered by the author, added to my enjoyment of these cassette tapes.	2005-01-20

Michael Gelb wrote one of my favorite books, HOW TO THINK LIKE LEONARDO DA VINCI . . . it is also a book we use in the Creativity class that I team teach at Bucks County Community College.<br /><br />So when I saw that Gelb had written a follow-up to the above, DA VINCI DECODED: DISCOVERING THE SPIRITUAL SECRETS OF LEONARDO'S SEVEN PRINCIPLES, I got hold of a copy and looked forward to reading it was great anticipation . . . and am I glad that I did . . . Gelb has another winner!<br /><br />This time, he takes the principles and shows you how they can be used to cultivate your spiritual potential . . . each chapter has a helpful self-assessment, along with a useful \\"seek the truth\\" exercise.<br /><br />I also liked the many quotes sprinkles throughout the book, many of them from Da Vinci.<br /><br />There were several memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />Leonardo's drawing of the embryo reminds us that we all come from the same Source. It beckons us to revitalize our birthright of curiosita. All of us are born with dynamic curiosity, the desire to explore, know, and understand, to seek the truth-though few of us keep it as alive within as Leonardo did. In the words of Glen Doman, of the Institute for the Achievement of Human Potential: \\"Every child is born with the potential genius of Leonardo da Vinci, and then we go about de-geniusing them.\\"<br /><br />In the face of these and many other challenges, Leonardo writes notes of encouragement, affirmation, and inspiration to himself: \\"I shall continue,\\" \\"I never tire of being useful,\\" \\"Obstacles do not bend me,\\" \\"Every obstacle is destroyed through rigor,\\" and \\"Fix your course to a star and you can navigate through the storm.\\" The star to which Leonardo fixed his course was his intellectual rigor, his freedom from preconceived ideas or opinions.<br /><br />The same wisdom can be applied to the beginning and end of each day. It's also a good idea to craft some kind of ritual that signals the end of your work life and the beginning of your home life, especially if you are in a relationship. Taking a minute or two with your partner after work to honor your connection to each other, and to a higher purpose, can transform the hours you spend together, giving you a deeper sense of alignment with your beloved.ork life and the beginning of your home life, especially if you are in a relationship.

The biggest threat to marriage is divorce. Divorce is kicking marriage's ass. Divorced is what ruined my marriage, not<br /><br />Stacy and Anna getting hitched. Most marriages end in divorce. If Bush and the Christian conservatives really want to protect marriage they should propose a constitutional amendment to<br /><br />ban divorce. Divorce is in direct opposition to their Christian beliefs more so than gay marriage. . . . Marriage should be like the Mafia--once you're in, you're in.<br /><br />Many other parts of YEAH, I SAID IT got me thinking . . . yet others got me laughing out loud . . . among them:<br /><br />When we'd go on vacation, he'd want to ride jet skis; I'd want to get a nap by the pool. I guess when you reach a certain age you don't even entertain the idea of doing something that if it goes wrong it could be life threatening. You figure if you've made it this far, you gotta save what life you got left.<br /><br />Here's a tip for you guys. When a woman asks you to do something and prefaces it with \\"when you get a chance,\\" or \\"when you get around to it,\\" just stop what you're doing and do the sh*t right then and there. When we ask, we really don't mean when you get a chance, when you feel like it,<br /><br />or when you get around to it. No, we mean right now. If you do it, you'll save yourself a lot of time and grief and a lot of arguments.<br /><br />When you call me, do me a favor. Leave me messages saying why you called. Do not leave a message telling me to call you, because I won't. \\"Hey, Wanda, it's Dino. Call me.\\" Why? I sense no urgency in your message. At least mention jail, or bail, or drinks or something. Don't be all vague or you will not hear from me. I figure if you're just calling to talk, you'll call back.of arguments.  <br /> <br />When you call me, do me a favor.

A little background on John Wooden: he coached the UCLA Bruins to 10 national basketball titles in 12 years . . . even if you're not a hoops fan, imagine any team--high school, college or pro--ever doing that, and you'll realize that it's virtually an impossible task . . .yet Wooden managed to accomplish it, at times with such great players as Kareem Abdul Jabbar (then Lew Alcindor) and Bill Walton; at other times with guys you probably never even heard about.<br /><br />So that's why I jumped at the chance to read MY PERSONAL BEST:<br /><br />LIFE LESSONS FROM AN ALL-AMERICAN JOURNEY that Wooden wrote with Steve Jamison . . . it was excellent and a \\"must\\" read for any sports fan, coach or parent of an athlete . . . adding to my enjoyment were rare, never-before-seen pictures from Wooden's private collection.<br /><br />You might not learn anything that you haven't heard before, but that's much of what made Wooden such a great coach--and man . . . he stuck to the basics, believing that if his players practiced them, they would succeed . . . no detail was considered insignificant; for example, he<br /><br />planned practices down to the exact minute on three-by-five inch cards and in notebooks \\"so there was never any standing around waiting for something to happen.\\"<br /><br />He also was a big believer in the use of maxims and mottos, tacking them on the bulletin board . . . among them:<br /><br />Discipline yourself and others won't have to,<br /><br />Respect every opponent but fear none,<br /><br />The best way to improve your team is to improve yourself,<br /><br />Do not mistake activity for achievement,<br /><br />It is amazing how much we can accomplish when non one cares<br /><br />who gets the credit, and<br /><br />Time spent getting even would be better spent getting ahead.<br /><br />As Wooden notes, \\"Some might say these are corny expressions, but I believe the messages they contain are true and have a positive impact on those who read them.\\"	2005-01-04

I had to quit being selfish and thinking of the things he couldn't do and start concentrating on the things he could do.\\"<br /><br />And what Jimmy could do is just about everything . . . he is now 10, and part of what made this book so special for me was that I could almost watch him grow before my eyes as a result of the many wonderful pictures that were included.<br /><br />Kenney presents much useful advice for parents of any child . . . for example, she says, \\"When buying toys or gifts, consider how your child can and should move. It can be disappointing to receive a gift and not be able to use it. Our family consults us on birthdays and Christmas before<br /><br />making purchases, which helps to avoid this problem.\\"<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to any parent or grandparent, as well as to anybody else who works with children . . . you'll not only learn more about cerebral palsy, you'll also learn about life<br /><br />and how it can be lived to the fullest--regardless of health.	2005-01-04

Imagine coming \\"to the realization that the more you learn, the more you expand the periphery of your ignorance\\" . . . that happens when you're 18, according to Hugh Downs in his moving LETTER TO A GREAT GRANDSON.<br /><br />Downs, who coanchored ABS's 20/20 and who hosted NBC's TODAY show for nine years, originally wrote this book as a letter to his great grandson . . . he meant it to be read at various stages of the boy's life.<br /><br />It made me realize how much we can learn from our family and made me want to know more about my dad's life (hint-hint to him, if he's reading).<br /><br />Downs discusses the joys, possibilities and challenges of infancy, young adulthood, middle age, old age, and everything in between . . . I particularly liked the fact that he helped me see that getting old is what we make of it, as evidenced by his own remarkable life . . . for instance, he went through the NASA space training that John Glenn did when both were 77.<br /><br />There were many insightful passages; among them:<br /><br />I tend to be a denier. This is not all bad. I tried to avoid the word \\"painful.\\" I said my knee condition was \\"annoying.\\" I did not want to believe the condition was (a) irreversible, (b) painful, (c) something that could diminish the quality of my life. The result was that, toward the last, if I walked six blocks in Manhattan, I found it \\"annoying\\" enough that I was ready to sit on the curb and wait for a cab.<br /><br />The only strong feelings I have that might be linked to a religious outlook are of overwhelming gratitude at being favored with such a good life. If people who have been dealt a bad hand--people who suffer, physically or mentally, or are the victims of great tragedy--can manifest real faith, it would be pathetic if I couldn't feel something long that line, considering my fortunate<br /><br />circumstances.<br /><br />About ten years before you were born I interviewed a number of centenarians who participated in a University of Georgia study. They were the cream of the crop, because the study was not about disease and impairment so much as trying to find out what changes there were in healthy people that old. These people, men and women, ranged in age from 102 to 106, and like any other age group, varied widely among themselves. But they had a couple of things in common: not one of them was bitter, or hate-filled, or complaining. I wondered if that had something to do with their longevity. And while they were mentally agile, and in some cases quite sharp, none of them was<br /><br />physically robust.

You must have a customer. Go get that customer.\\"<br /><br />There were several other useful tidbits of information; among them:<br /><br />Your business exists for only three reasons: to solve a customer's problem, or to make a customer feel good, or both. There are no other reasons for your company to exist. It is every single employee's job, in any company, to directly or indirectly get and keep customers. So,<br /><br />if you are the only employee in your company, as is often the case, your job is to sell your company's products or services . . . to solve the customer's problem or to make the customer feel good. You are responsible for generating 100 percent of your company's revenues. You are your company's rainmaker!<br /><br />Boys and girls who worked as paperboys have an edge. So, too do boys and girls who have worked as caddies, cow milkers, lawn mowers, snow shovelers, babysitters, food servers, crop pickers, dishwashers, grocery baggers. Good child labor produces good adult employees.<br /><br />Customers love getting a little extra. Customers love doing business with companies that are full of fun surprises. Be like the hairdressing salon in Farmington, Connecticut, that lets each customer leave with a single red rose.

Two months after the campaign<br /><br />started, the airline went bankrupt. Perhaps the ad was involved.<br /><br />Hey there! You with the sweat in your palms.

So does the pilot, deep down<br /><br />inside.<br /><br />There were several other amusing tidbits; among them:<br /><br />Three New Jersey townships--Upper Pittsgrove, Alloway and Quinton--in 1993 contracted for elevator inspectors, as per the orders of the state Department of Community Affairs (DCA). One problem: There are no elevators in any of the three towns. That's no excuse, according to a DCA<br /><br />spokesman.

When I read a book in just a few hours, it typically means that I really enjoyed it . . . such was certainly the case with 365 WAYS TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE by Suzanne Somers.<br /><br />She presents essays for every day of the year that are based on real-life examples involving her own life . . . I could relate to many of them . . .  and for those that weren't relevant to me, I could<br /><br />see how they have affected the lives of others I know.<br /><br />I particularly liked the affirmations Somers gives at the end of each essay . . . they might seem basic, yet too often we need to be reminded that:<br /><br />Each day is another chance to get it right. Today I am going to concentrate on kindness, caring, accountability, decency, and love. I realize as a human being I make mistakes, but as I grow I use each bump in the road as a springboard for learning. Every day I will try harder to be the best person I can be, but I will not chastise myself when I fail. Failure is part of the journey, and I am grateful for it.<br /><br />Or:<br /><br />I will not wait until it is too late to tell those who mean something to me how I feel about them. The words, \\" I should have\\" will feel empty if I miss out on my chance.<br /><br />I found myself continually taking notes on ideas that I could apply to my daily existence . . . the problem: there were so many of them that it was hard to narrow them down to just these few that I could present here:<br /><br />Eliminate the word should from your vocabulary. Should is judgmental, inferring you \\"know better\\" than the other. Whenever you start any sentence with \\"You never\\" or \\"You always\\" or \\"You should,\\" the person on the receiving end feels backed into a corner. Just as a snake strikes when backed into a corner, so too will we humans. What good is accomplished when you back someone against the wall? It would be constructive to say, \\"When you (blank) it makes me feel (blank).\\" For instance, \\"When you use that tone of voice, it makes me feel a fool.\\" It would take an inordinate degree of insensitivity for the accuser not to apologize. Then the argument or accusations are over. Now you have been able to express your feelings without either person<br /><br />being hurt. This is the art of communicating: expressing your feelings at the moment they occur, to keep them from building up and out of proportion, without wounding another while doing so. The only thing we \\"should\\" do in life is to make ourselves the best person we can be. That is enough to occupy ourselves for a lifetime.<br /><br />Today I use the following exercise in my daily life, and I am amazed at how it has helped me in my quest to be a better person. When criticized, I agree with the person with whom I am talking, if in fact I can see the wisdom of their criticism. Suddenly the discussion shifts in its thrust. The other person is stopped midthought, and true and real discussion takes place. As a result we both learn something from the encounter. Usually we become closer. My mother did know best. I hope she knows it.<br /><br />What is your gift? What is it you do well? When you know that, you will be able to live your best life through the giving of your gift. This is necessary to feel that your life has meaning. There is nothing more painful than knowing you have not discovered and developed your talent, that you have missed your opportunity to make your mark on the world. Discovering your true gift and<br /><br />following it are essential to being happy. When you have not done the work to find what it is that you love, you will end up living with the realization that you are unhappy because you are living the wrong life. How many lawyers are sitting in their stuffy offices wishing that instead of going to law school, because that was the job that paid the most money, they had become a basketball coach? After all the schooling, it would take tremendous courage to announce that law wasn't all it was cracked up to be; that most of the work lawyers do is reading long, boring brief. The equation is simple: Do what you love, and you will be happy.work lawyers do is reading long, boring brief. The equation is simple: Do what you love, and you will be happy. <br />	2004-11-09

As soon as he arrives, Ken casually visits with these individuals and congratulates them. He may offer kudos to an employee who recently got married or had a child or praise someone who gave a great presentation. His favorite line is: \\"I've been hearing a lot of good talk behind your back.\\"<br /><br />* Our schools, which are built around \\"core curricula\\" that students have to learn regardless of their interests or natural talents, reinforce this kind of thinking. When a child excels at a subject and receives an A, what happens? Rather than recognizing and developing areas of talent, teachers and parents skip past the A and focus on raising the lower grades on the report card. And very few principals or guidance counselors are known for \\"calling students into the office\\"<br /><br />to discuss outstanding grades.<br /><br />And, lastly, this one got me really thinking:<br /><br />* Of course, few moments are this profound, but even less memorable interactions are important. Positive Psychology experts are finding that the frequency of small, positive acts is critical. John Gottman's pioneering research on marriages suggests there is a \\"magic ratio\\" of 5 to 1-in terms of our balance of positive to negative interactions.

SEE YOU AT THE TOP by Zig Ziglar was the first positive thinking book I ever read . . . I still remember his philosophy: \\"You can get anything you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want.\\"<br /><br />Since then, I've read and/or heard many similar books--including just about everything else by Ziglar . . . so when I saw something new by him (A VIEW FROM THE TOP, a taped production), I jumped at the opportunity to hear it . . . my only regret: that it's been too long since I last visited with Zig.<br /><br />It may take you a bit of time to get used to his folksy style, but please do stick with it . . . you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />He has many worthwhile ideas to share, such as:<br /><br />Success is not enough. Your next step is to move to significance.<br /><br />You don't have to be great to start, but you've got to start to be great.<br /><br />Read wherever you are; e.g., in a doctor's office, supermarket line, etc. Always have reading material with you.<br /><br />The two most important things a husband or wife can say to each other: 1. I love you; and 2. I believe in you.<br /><br />If you have a dream, don't way \\"no way.\\" Instead, say, \\"Why can't I?\\"<br /><br />Put your heart into something; the rest will follow.<br /><br />Think about what you want your obituary to say.<br /><br />You'll have real joy when you see somebody that you've helped become successful.<br /><br />In addition, I liked the story he told about the success of both the Penn State and Notre Dame football programs . . . the two have more graduates on pro football teams than any other<br /><br />two colleges . . . they are also the only two major colleges that don't put the names of players on the back of their uniforms.<br /><br />And his story of Lou Holtz really struck home . . . when Holtz was the Notre Dame coach, 11 of his assistants left to take better head coaching jobs elsewhere . . . so what was in it<br /><br />for Holtz? He felt that the best coaches not already working for him would flock to do so, and they did . . . and when they came to work for him, they would bring along their respective<br /><br />contacts and help Notre Dame get even better players.best coaches not already working for him would flock to do so, and they did . . . and when they came to work for him, they would bring along their respective  <br />contacts and help Notre Dame get even better players.  <br />	2004-10-14

My investing guru recommended that I read THE ART OF INVESTING & PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT by Ronald Cordes, Brian O'Toole and Richard Steiny, I made it a point to do so.<br /><br />And I'm glad I did . . . though a bit technical in spots, there's a lot of useful information here that makes sense if you can cut through the jargon . . . in particular, I liked what the authors called their \\"proven\\" 6-step process to meet your financial goals:<br /><br />Step 1: Perform financial self-analysis.<br /><br />Step 2: Build an efficient portfolio.<br /><br />Step 3: Bring a portfolio strategist on board.<br /><br />Step 4: Implement your plan.<br /><br />Step 5: Rebalance regularly.<br /><br />Step 6: Track your progress.<br /><br />But not only are these six steps listed, they are also described in detail . . . so I now have a better sense of what I need to do to get ahead . . . or if not that, to at least keep from falling behind.<br /><br />There are many useful tidbits of information, such as the following:<br /><br />Emphasize the importance of asset allocation. The world's best institutional investors recognize a fact that may surprise you:<br /><br />The decision about which specific stocks, bonds, or other investments you select for your portfolio has little bearing on your returns. A much more important factor is how the dollars you invest are divided up among various types of broad asset categories-such as stocks, bonds, international investments, cash, and so on. Yet, despite its importance, few investors fully grasp the concept of asset allocation.<br /><br />Wilshire's findings show that past performance is, in fact, an extremely poor predictor of future results. Of the managers that delivered top- quartile returns during the first 5-year period, just 21 percent managed to do the same during the second 5-year period. Amazingly, a full 50 percent of these managers posted bottom-quartile (i.e., the worst possible) returns.<br /><br />Yet, despite the attention that's been given to asset allocation over the years, it remains one of the most misunderstood and underused components of investing. If every investor truly understood and practiced sound asset allocation strategies, no one would invest the bulk of their<br /><br />retirement savings in their employer's stock, as so many workers do through their 401(k) plans. And certainly on one would make the mistake of buying a dozen different technology stocks and calling themselves well-diversified investors-a common practice during the late 1990s<br /><br />that caused a staggering amount of wealth to be lost in the ensuing years.o asset allocation over the years, it remains one of the most misunderstood and underused components of investing.

A friend suggested that I read FIND A HUSBAND AFTER 35 USING WHAT I LEARNED AT HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL by Rachel Greenwald, M.B.A . . . also billed as a \\"simple 15-step action program,\\" I found it fascinating to read from a marketing standpoint . . . Greenwald<br /><br />takes basic concepts (packaging, branding, etc.) and shows how they can be applied to find not just dates--but dates with what she calls wonderful men.<br /><br />Her advice, though directed at women, can also be used by men as well as those in homosexual relationships . . . I know I'm going to recommend the book to all my single friends not presently<br /><br />in relationships.<br /><br />Some of Greenwald's thoughts were so amazingly simple that I can't believe that others had not thought of them before . . . or at least given them out as useful tips . . . for example, she tells<br /><br />women not to use the bathroom during intermission . . . the lines are long then and time will be wasted when it could better be spent networking . . . rather, she urges women to use the<br /><br />bathroom just before intermission (when there are no lines), then use the next 15-20 minutes to mix and mingle.<br /><br />There were many other memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />* Value you best customers: Go buy a few boxes of very nice thank-you notecards. Each card might cost about a dollar. You can never have enough of these throughout your Program journey. There are going to be so many people who will help you, support you, and fix you up,<br /><br />and you must be very conscientious about thanking each and every one. Just as in business, you must treat your best customers well to gain repeat sales. What better way to encourage your \\"best customers\\" to fix you up again than by sending them a heartfelt thank-you note?<br /><br />If you've ever been a matchmaker for some of your friends, I would bet that few of them have gone out of their way to show their appreciation for your efforts, especially if the fix-up didn't work out. This is one area where you can stand apart from other women hoping for matches:<br /><br />Simply send a warm, lovely thank-you note after someone has been kind enough to make an introduction for you.<br /><br />* Do you wear a push-up bra? Always wear a push-up bra:<br /><br />After 35 it can't hurt and can only help.<br /><br />Don't think you have to be dressed up all the time, but don't wear your sweatpants with the holes in them or your baggy old clothes a you wander about town. As my grandmother used to say, \\"There are no ugly women, just lazy ones!\\" You never know where Mr. Right is, so don't be caught looking dumpy when you suddenly meet him standing in line at the post office.<br /><br />* As a top salesperson will tell you, the rule is \\"ABC\\": Always Be Closing. Try to \\"close a sale\\" if you have the opportunity. For example, a girlfriend sees you at the hair salon and approaches you to say hello. She hasn't seen you in a few months and asks, \\"Hi! How are you?\\" If you are conscious of escaping your rut and turning a casual conversation into an opportunity to find a husband, you might reply:<br /><br />\\"I'm great, thanks! Since I saw you last, I have made a big commitment to find someone to share my life with this year. I would love to meet as many new men as possible. Say, do you by any chance know any single men?\\"s is one area where you can stand apart from other women hoping for matches: <br />Simply send a warm, lovely thank-you note after someone has been kind enough to make an introduction for you. <br /> <br />* Do you wear a push-up bra?

Heard the taped version of Wayne Dyer's HOW TO GET WHAT YOU REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY WANT, which seemed to be taken from one of his TV specials.<br /><br />My overall impression: Still another winner from Dyer.<br /><br />If you ever get the chance to read, see or listen to him, jump at the opportunity . . . he is soooo fine . . . his advice is always down-to-earth, and you'll find that it can be applied to any virtually any situation that you are facing.<br /><br />In HOW TO GET, Dyer urges you to release all negativity, blame and venom . . . break all bonds with the past, dwelling instead on love and forgiveness . . . as A COURSE IN MIRACLES teaches, \\"I can choose peace\\" . . . Dyer's message is to make that choice and everything you want can be yours.<br /><br />Furthermore, I got value from these other thoughts of his:<br /><br />Practice being kind rather than being right.<br /><br />When you keep your attention on what you want you don't want, what you don't want is what will keep manifesting in your life.<br /><br />Never ever allow yourself to think about what you don't want. That's what separates masters from ordinary human beings.	2004-09-30

John Maxwell's THINKING FOR A CHANGE was one of the best books I read last year . . . so when I saw RUNNING WITH THE GIANTS, another title from this NEW YORK TIMES best selling author and motivational teacher, I scooped it up eagerly.<br /><br />The premise certainly caught my attention . . . Maxwell imagines that he is running with various Old Testament heroes, and he presents the advice that he receives from each one.<br /><br />For example, he urges you to think about Noah for when you wonder if your life really counts . . . to think about Esther for when you are uncertain about your future . . . and to think about Joseph for when your life isn't turning out the way you planned . . . Moses, Rebekah, Abraham, David, and Jonathan are among the others who also appear in this short (136 pages) in but thought-provoking work.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the questions for personal reflection after each section, such as this one:<br /><br />What helps you to do the right thing when those around you are doing wrong?<br /><br />In addition, Maxwell presented a prayer from each Biblical character . . . this one, entitled \\"Jonathan's Prayer for Us,\\" caught my attention:<br /><br />Sovereign Master and King,<br /><br />Please empower my friends to see the big picture so they may know their place and be glad to be a part of something great, cultivate the right attitude toward the potential and success of others, and possess a servant's heart that receives great joy in adding value to leaders.<br /><br />Amen<br /><br />There were several other memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />[writing about Moses]<br /><br />Soon we are running our lap together. For a while, we simply travel side-by-side, waiting to hear what he says. Finally, Moses, the man who spoke with God face-to-face as one would to a friend, says, \\"live in the faith zone, not the safe zone.\\"<br /><br />As we continue running, Moses seems to consider what he wants to tell us. Finally he says, \\"Each person's life story is written in risks--the ones taken and the ones avoided. Look at my life. Do you think you would know my story if I hadn't stepped out of the safe zone? Would I even be talking to you right now if I hadn't entered the faith zone?\\" His gaze is fixed on us. It is intense.<br /><br />\\"The greatest moment in my walk with God came at the burning bush,\\" Moses continues. \\"The decision I made there that day wrote the next forty years of my life story. It is a decision that brought daily encounters with the living God! But in the moment of decision, it was not easy<br /><br />to make.\\"<br /><br />[writing about Rebekah]<br /><br />Rebekah went the extra mile. Her generosity stands in stark contrast to the prevailing attitudes today. Rebekah seemed to be saying, I'll do what you asked me to do, then I'm going to do something more. In contrast, many people today seem to be thinking, I'm going to do the least that is expected of me, and I'm going to try to get the most out of it. Sadly, this underlying spirit has even crept into the lives and thoughts of many people of faith. Few individuals desire to do<br /><br />more than they must.

A friend recommended JUICE FASTING & DETOXIFICATION by Steve Meyerowitz . . . and though the title might not ordinarily interest me, I figured that with that with Yom Kippur upon us (and me celebrating ALL holidays), what would be so bad about a fast? Besides, I have gained a few pounds over the past few months.<br /><br />So that said, I delved into JUICE FASTING with great enthusiasm; i.e., until I got up to page 27 . . . then I came across the following almost stopped reading:<br /><br />Speaking of activity, sexual activity should be avoided while fasting and until full strength is recovered. Sex redirects the amount of available energy to the sexual organs for stimulation. This is a setback to the fasting process and a stress on your whole system since the sexual organs are dormant and would need to be revitalized.<br /><br />Fortunately, Meyerowitz goes on to say that the above recommendation applies to water fasting . . . and he typically doesn't recommend that; rather, he urges people to be into juice fasting.<br /><br />Also, I learned that such fasting can have many other benefits, including detoxification, healing, spiritual, help to break addictions, political/social, and dental work.<br /><br />In addition, fasting helps a wide variety of conditions, such as allergies, asthma, hay fever, hives, migraines, obesity, insomnia, high and low blood pressure, acne, rheumatism, ulcers, liver problems, gall stones, constipation, and diarrhea.<br /><br />I also learned several other things from reading JUICE FASTING; among them:<br /><br />Nothing is more nutritious than juice. Imagine eating a meal of spinach, parsley, sprouts, tomatoes, lemon, celery, radishes, green pepper, and cucumber. Ordinarily, considering the normal state of our digestive systems, we would be lucky to digest 70 percent of it. But once you<br /><br />extract the liquid portion of these vital foods, you can assimilate and absorb up to 99 percent of the food value even if you have weak digestion. In fact, the beauty of it is that it barely takes any digestive energy at all, which is why it is so suitable for fasting. This condensing of pounds of valuable foods into a single glass while simultaneously maximizing assimilation is what makes drinking juices special. Take carrots for example. It takes a pound of carrots to make a 10 ½ ounce drink of carrot juice . . . mmm, delicious. But could you consume that many carrots? Absolutely not!  Yet all the enzymes, water-soluble vitamins, minerals, and trace elements in those carrots are extracted (assuming it is a quality juicing machine) and condensed into the glass<br /><br />of juice.<br /><br />Don't get too excited about guzzling down delicious fruit juices unless you plan to make them yourself. Bottled juices must be pasteurized in order to have a shelf life. Of what significance is that? Pasteurized juices are boiled to sanitize these foods against bacteria and disease<br /><br />organisms. Unfortunately, enzymes and may vitamins are destroyed along with it. Your only source of nourishment is these juices and you cannot afford to drink enzyme-less and vitamin poor liquids. Do not be fooled by the delicious taste and interesting assortment of flavors.<br /><br />Though they taste good, they are basically dead foods. There is no live nutrition left-only sugar, flavor and water. Even the taste and color is no match against the fresh squeezed version. Which do you prefer-fresh squeezed orange juice or the store bought kind? If you like your orange juice fresh, you will really be amazed at the difference between fresh squeezed and bottled apple juice. Fresh apple juice is white-just like the color of the apple when you bite into it. Bottled apple juice is brown because vitamins have been oxidized upon contact with the air. Just exposing live nutrients to air and light is enough to destroy some of these fragile friends. Run your apples<br /><br />through your juicer machine and taste the difference. Manufacturers can get away with it because the terms have been used loosely for a long time and the regulatory agencies have not laid down strict definitions for them.<br /><br />Frozen juice is not as preferable as fresh, nevertheless it is another alternative. The process of freezing and thawing destroys some fragile vitamins, enzymes, and cell factors. However, everything is relative. It is not nearly as destructive as pasteurization, canning or irradiating. Frozen juice still tastes good and it is better than buying bottled juices at the store. It is one level removed from being totally fresh and alive. However, if that juice is your whole dinner,<br /><br />such as on a fast, you must have the best. Fasters count on getting every vitamin. Freeze only if you have more juice than you drink, or if circumstances deem it the best alternative.<br /><br />Myerowitz concludes with a useful chapter on buying a juicer and though I'm not quite ready for that, it is something that I'll definitely consider for the future!can get away with it because the terms have been used loosely for a long time and the regulatory agencies have not laid down strict definitions for them. <br /> <br />Frozen juice is not as preferable as fresh, nevertheless it is another alternative.

What do Reggie Jackson, Steve Wynn, Aretha Franklin, and Regis Philbin have in common? They're all part of a typical day in the life of Donald J. Trump, author of<br /><br />TRUMP: HOW TO GET RICH.<br /><br />For some reason, I'm not a big fan of THE APPRENTICE--Trump's popular TV show . . . but I've enjoyed his other books (TRUMP: THE ART OF THE DEAL, TRUMP: SURVIVING AT THE TOP and TRUMP: THE ART OF THE COMEBACK) and liked this latest one, too, in spite of what I thought was excessive name-dropping.<br /><br />Yet the guy does get around . . . in fact, my favorite part of the book was a chapter called \\"A Week in the Life\\" . . . it didn't give any specific advice on how to get rich, but it did show you how much fun Trump has . . . and as he notes, \\"I doubt I'd be as successful as I am if I weren't having such a good time.\\"<br /><br />I also liked the chapter entitled \\"Prime Time\\" . . . it dealt with how THE APPRENTICE was produced.<br /><br />Though the book was a bit skimpy on specific advice on how to get rich, there were several memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />Be aware of the marketplace. Know what's going on now. That's one reason I devote several hours a day to reading. That's how long it takes to both keep up with current events and learn from the greats in history. How can you expect to be successful if your idea of what's happening in the world is vague or nonexistent? That's like saying, \\"I know that September 11 happened, but I choose not to acknowledge it. It gets in the way of my positive outlook on things.\\" That approach<br /><br />is fine if you're a professional fairy-tale writer.<br /><br />I've said it before--I even wrote a chapter on the art of the prenup in one of my other books--but I'll say it again for anyone about to propose: A prenuptial agreement doesn't mean that you won't<br /><br />always love your spouse. It doesn't mean that you have doubts about the person's integrity or questions about the relationship. All it means is that you recognize that life, especially the parts<br /><br />involving love and business, can be complicated. People have a right to protect their assets. If you own your own business and you're facing a difficult divorce without having secured a prenuptial agreement, your negligence could jeopardize the livelihoods of your employees. I know plenty of women who are supporting their husbands, and this advice applies equally to both sexes.<br /><br />Howard [Cosell] could sit on a dais with sports figures he hadn't seen for thirty years and quote their exact statistics. His memory was amazing. Then he wrote his final book and knocked almost<br /><br />everyone he knew, from Roone Arledge to Frank Gifford, one of the finest people around. It did a lot of damage to him, because all of his friends turned against him. I remember saying to him,<br /><br />\\"Howard, you can knock twenty percent of the people, maybe twenty-five percent or thirty percent of the people, but you can't knock everybody. You didn't say anything nice about anybody in the book. It was the wrong thing to do. I believe in knocking people, but you can't knock everybody.\\"at you recognize that life, especially the parts  <br />involving love and business, can be complicated.

Heard the taped version of TO SPACE AND BACK by Sally Ride, the first American woman to fly in space . . . though supposedly written for a young adult audience, I nevertheless found it a fascinating account of what it would be to like to have to eat, sleep and work while circling the Earth.<br /><br />It has also made me think twice about consuming something as simple as a peanut butter sandwich . . . while you or I would just go to our fridge and prepare such a delicacy in minutes, when in space, you can't just do this whenever you want to . . . you must have at least one other person with you at all times to do such mundane tasks as hold the jar lid when you go to get a knife.	2004-09-08

Sam Goldwyn, legendary film producer, is credited with having first said, \\"The harder I work, the luckier I get\\" . . . I kept thinking about that quote as I read AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT by Joshua Piven--a fascinating collection of stories from lottery wins to fad products and a whole lot<br /><br />in-between.<br /><br />In nine short chapters, Piven introduces an eclectic range of  individuals who all have something to say about how luck impacted their lives . . . he also brought in research on the subject, as well as these techniques that can help better ensure the results we get in life are ones we can live with:<br /><br />First, when possible, be prepared.<br /><br />Second, keep an open mind.<br /><br />Third, stay informed.<br /><br />Fourth, stay curious and know where to look for new ideas.<br /><br />Fifth, maintain broad, diverse circles of personal and professional relationships.<br /><br />Sixth, trust your emotions and your instincts.<br /><br />Seventh, share your good luck with others.<br /><br />Eighth, be self-reliant.<br /><br />Lastly, keep a positive mental attitude--perhaps the most important aspect of effective luck management.<br /><br />I particularly liked reading about Steve Roberts, the swimming pool repairman who had only a $100 bill to pay for his hot dog . . . so he asked for his change in lottery tickets and won $180 million . . . in addition, I was inspired by the stories of Gary Dahl and Al Kahn, the brains behind the Pet Rock and Cabbage Patch doll, respectively.<br /><br />Also, there were several memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />In attempting to counter his bad luck, Bennet was showing many of the signs of a condition mental health professionals call \\"illusory control.\\" First identified by the Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer in the 1970s, illusory control is the belief that we are in control even when, objectively, we're not. Some common examples of this phenomenon deal with luck and chance. The lottery player who chooses his own number, or the gambler who insists on rolling his own dice, experiences the illusion of control over a random, uncontrollable situation. Illusory control is<br /><br />an adaptive measure that can increase motivation when one is facing difficult or adverse circumstances. It may make the player feel better about his chances, that his actions will cause a specific outcome, even when, from an observer's perspective, it is obvious that the event itself cannot be influenced.<br /><br />The mathematician and author John Allen Paulos relates the tale, probably a fable, of the frequent flyer who is deathly afraid of the remote possibility of a bomb on his plane. Knowing the chances are low-but not low enough for comfort-the man decides he will always travel with a bomb in his suitcase, reasoning that the odds against having two bombs on an airplane would be astronomical.<br /><br />But perhaps the lens through which we judge bad luck needs a wider view, and a sharper focus. Steve feels that every negative is simply a chance to create a positive, and in this way his bad luck was transformed into good luck for the hundreds of people he and his organization have helped, people who desperately needed assistance and had nowhere left to turn. \\"You learn from bad experiences,\\" he says. \\"And one of the things you learn is that you either hate the world<br /><br />or you help the world. Being struck was my lot in life, but it happened for a reason.\\"player who chooses his own number, or the gambler who insists on rolling his own dice, experiences the illusion of control over a random, uncontrollable situation.

Having previously enjoyed David Niven's THE 100 SIMPLE SECRETS OF SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE, I was excited to come across another book by him: THE 100 SECRETS OF HAPPY<br /><br />PEOPLE . . . this effort was equally as good.<br /><br />It takes what sounds like a basic concept--happiness--and breaks it down into chunks that anybody can read and then think about . . . each \\"secret\\" is accompanied by a great example and/or story.<br /><br />In addition, Niven has somehow managed to find a piece of research that backs up the points he is making . . . sometimes, these are a bit of a stretch . . . yet most often, they are right on target, as in when he urges readers to \\"enjoy what you have\\" . . . to support his advice, he quotes a 1995 study by Sirgy, Cole, Kosenko, and Meadow: \\"People who have the most are only as likely to be happy as those who have the least. People who like what they have, however, are twice<br /><br />as likely to be happy as those who actually have the most.\\"<br /><br />There were several memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />You are neither a better nor worse person for the kind of car you drive, the size of your home, or the performance of your mutual funds. Remember what really matters in your life.<br /><br />There is no objective way to tell you if you have had a good life, a good day, or a good hour. Your life is a success based only upon your judgment.<br /><br />Don't spend your time evaluating humor, asking yourself, \\"Is it really funny?\\" or \\"Do others think it's funny?\\" Just react and enjoy it.	2004-08-27

Rose, talking about her first book (LIP SERVICE) on a TV-talk show . . . it sounded interesting to me, so I got a copy and read it . . . no, make that, devoured<br /><br />it . . . it was one of the best novels I had read in a long time.<br /><br />I also liked her follow-ups, IN FIDELITY and FLESH TONES . . . so when I saw that she had a new book out, THE HALO EFFECT, I just had to get my own copy . . . starting it at the end of my Italy trip, I almost couldn't put it down--finishing it within two days.<br /><br />It's that good!<br /><br />This latest effort is the first in what promises to be a series . . . it is a suspenseful thriller about Dr. Morgan Snow, one of New York's top sex therapists . . . one of her clients, Cleo Thane, asks her to read her unpublished tell-all book--then disappears.<br /><br />The ensuing search is full of both sex and thrills, and it left me guessing until the very last page . . . it also left me looking forward to Rose's next book.<br /><br />She is a writer who really gets into her characters . . . in this book, there were several memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />She reached out and touched my hand, to thank me. Her skin, even on her fingertips, was like finely spun satin. It was unusual for my patients to touch me, but I didn't pull back, didn't flinch or show any reaction. Touch is telling. Lack of touch is even more telling. There is nothing as sacred as one person reaching out to another with their body to offer connection, and I would never treat such a thing lightly. There was nothing sexual about the way she put her fingers on the back of my hand and exerted a small but real pressure, but it woke me up in a momentarily sexual way. It made me think about sex, not with her, not with a man, but just inside of myself. Two fingers on my skin and she made me crave something I couldn't quite name.<br /><br />\\"Besides the arm, how else was your day?\\" It was our routine. To go over the day. Usually we did it at dinner, but I was doing it now. The rule was we had to state one good thing for every bad thing. As many bad  things as you wanted.

His fingers were doing something to me that had noting to do with us knowing each other or liking each other or even caring if we ever found out anything more about each other. My skin didn't care that this was<br /><br />obscene, that I was playing a very dangerous game. My skin was enraptured by the ever-so-slight pressure of a man's fingertips sailing across its expanse.

Reading BIG RUSS & ME by Tim Russert reminded me of my childhood, in that the author grew up around the time that I did . . . he watched some of the same television shows, played some of the same games and had a dad who taught him some of the same lessons that I was fortunate enough to have learned.<br /><br /> Russert, the marvelous host of MEET THE PRESS, has written a &quot;feel good&quot; memoir about what it was like to grow up in the 1950s . . . in reading it, I felt like the author was right in<br /><br /> front of me--telling me about his childhood . . . and most importantly, about his hardworking father who worked two jobs without complaint for thirty years.<br /><br /> It certainly wasn't an easy thing to do, but Big Russ never stopped to question his fate . . . he just did what he had to do, every day, never stopping to take a day off just because he was tired or may have felt the desire to do so.<br /><br /> Consequently, Tim Russert learned to appreciate the values of self-discipline, of respect, of loyalty to friends, and you will too if you read this book . . . methinks it would also make a marvelous gift to give to your dad or somebody else's dad for no other reason than just because you were thinking of them.<br /><br /> There were several memorable passages; among them:<br /><br /> During normal times, the Queen Mary carried eleven hundred passengers, plus a sizable crew. When Dad's group made the crossing there were more than fourteen thousand men on board, which was not unusual during the war. Berths were everywhere--stacked six high in lounges, function rooms, and even in empty swimming pools. The men slept in shifts. They were fed<br /><br /> twice a day, also in shifts, and were given only a few minutes to eat. To ease congestion, all pedestrian traffic on board was one way: to move forward you walked on the starboard side; to move back you used the port side. All passengers had to wear life jackets in case they were attacked. There was no smoking, and even chewing gum was forbidden because it was hard to remove from the decks. The weather was rotten and many of the men were seasick. When I think about the crossing, I can't imagine how men of my own generation would have fared on board.<br /><br /> I thought back to the time we had gone to the NASCAR race, and I realized that I was learning that same lesson all over again. Luke was my son, but that didn't mean he was Tim Russert, Junior, or an instrument for Tim Russert to relive his youth. Yes, he's my son, but no, he's not me. Moreover, he was not breaking away, casting me aside, or turning his back on all of our shared memories. He was following his heart, just as I had done in my youth. That was his job, and I, too, had a job to do. My job was to reconcile myself to his uniqueness and his independence, to embrace it and encourage it. I couldn't allow my love as a father to suffocate his individualism. To put it another way, I had to remember not to get between a boy and his dreams.<br /><br /> I soon found out. Jerry Bruno walked over to a white courtesy telephone and told the operator, &quot;Would you please ask Robert Kennedy to meet his party at Gate 3?&quot; A moment later, we heard the announcement:<br /><br /> &quot;Robert Kennedy, Mr. Robert Kennedy, please meet your party at Gate 3.&quot; Immediately, about half the people in the airport converged on Gate 3. Bruno then repeated his request, and the crowd grew. When Kennedy stepped off the plane, a couple of hundred people were there to greet him. I was impressed.

(I refer to it as the &quot;wealth care system.&quot;) I naively expected managed care to manage to care! Rather than asking how I was feeling physically, emotionally, mentally, or<br /><br /> spiritually, the first question anyone asked was &quot;Who's your insurance carrier?&quot; Even though I'm a nurse, I was shocked. I'm now fully aware that our medical system needs healing. I want to be part of helping medicine treat the whole person and teach prevention and wellness. You may not be facing a medical crisis. But whatever mental, emotional, physical, or spiritual challenges your are now facing, I'm offering information, hope, and comfort in these pages.

I also like how it applies to virtually every situation in life--and not just attaining money.<br /><br /> That said, if it is money you want, you definitely won't go wrong by following this approach:<br /><br /> The method by which DESIRE for riches can be transmuted into its financial equivalent, consists of six definite, practical steps:<br /><br /> First. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire. It is not sufficient merely to say &quot;I want plenty of money.&quot; Be definite as to the amount.

(There is no such reality as &quot;something for nothing.&quot;)<br /><br /> Third. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you desire.<br /><br /> Fourth. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action.<br /><br /> Fifth. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and<br /><br /> describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it.<br /><br /> Sixth.

I had previously THE MEMORY BOOK, his bestseller co-authored with Jerry Lucas . . . so when I was at my local<br /><br /> library and saw one of his cassette tapes, HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR MEMORY, I jumped at the chance to listen to it.<br /><br /> It promises a lot, and that was perhaps my biggest problem with the program; i.e., it attempted to do too much . . . several techniques were glossed over in the 40 minutes, and I had trouble grasping them.<br /><br /> Yet that said, I did learn one way for remembering numbers (something that I've always had difficulty doing) . . . all you need to do is first remember Lorrayne's Phonetic Alphabet:<br /><br /> The sound for #1 will always be--T or D. The letter T has one downstroke.<br /><br /> The sound for #2 will always be--N. Typewritten n has two downstrokes.<br /><br /> The sound for #3 will always be--M. Typewritten m has three downstrokes.<br /><br /> The sound for #4 will always be--R. Final sound of the word &quot;four&quot; is R.<br /><br /> The sound for #5 will always be--L. Roman numeral for 50 is L.<br /><br /> The sound for #6 will always be--J, ch, sh, soft g, etc. The letter J turned around is almost like the number 6. (J6)<br /><br /> The sound for #7 will always be--K, hard c, and hard t. The number 7 can be used to form a K. One seven right-side up, and the other side down. (K)<br /><br /> The sound for #8 will always be--F or V. Written f and figure 8 both have two loops, one above the other. (f8)<br /><br /> The sound for #9 will always be--P or B. The number 9 turned around is P.<br /><br /> The sound for 0 will always be--S or Z.

I often contend that there are two sides to every side, if not<br /><br />more . . . that is why I so much enjoyed reading OFF WITH THEIR<br /><br />HEADS (see also Section 11) by Dick Morris, the Fox News Channel<br /><br />political analyst and onetime campaign advisor to President Bill Clinton.<br /><br />It opened my eyes to many things that took place both when<br /><br />Clinton was in the White House and, also, afterwards, as a result<br /><br />of his policies . . . but what I really liked about the book was that it<br /><br />attempted to show both the bad, and there was a lot of it, and<br /><br />the good . . . where Clinton does deserve praise, such as in<br /><br />his handling of the tobacco industry, Morris gives him appropriate<br /><br />credit . . . he does the same with Bush, mostly praising him--yet<br /><br />knocking him on how he has handled certain things such as<br /><br />the nursing home crisis.<br /><br />Some parts dragged, as in when the author criticized what he<br /><br />calls the Hollywood apologists . . . these are the stars who<br /><br />constantly speak out on matters they know nothing about . . . I<br /><br />could have done with a lot less than 42 pages on that<br /><br />subject . . . however, his report on France really helped me<br /><br />understand that subject a whole lot better.<br /><br />This book seemed to be well-researched . . . that said, it<br /><br />got me thinking, which is always a good thing!<br /><br />There were numerous passages that caught my attention;<br /><br />among them:<br /><br />Three of the 9/11 hijackers had been pulled over by traffic cops in the<br /><br />months before 9/11. Had the drivers' license proposal been accepted,<br /><br />we might have sent them packing to the Middle East before they had<br /><br />their chance to fly airplanes into our buildings. In April 2001-five months<br /><br />before 9/11-Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the hijackers, was<br /><br />stopped by police near Miami for driving without a license. He was<br /><br />summoned to appear in court, never showed up, a bench warrant was<br /><br />issued, and the matter ended. Had the motor vehicle/INS/FBI interface<br /><br />been functioning at that time, the traffic cop would have discovered<br /><br />that Atta was in the country illegally, his visa having expired in<br /><br />January 2001. Atta would have been arrested on the spot and bound<br /><br />over to the INS for deportation. He might not have been in the United<br /><br />States to lead the 9/11 hijackers on their grisly mission.<br /><br />Bush went to Congress to ask for approval of our mission in<br /><br />Afghanistan to retaliate against, and try to capture, bin Laden. He<br /><br />also asked Congress for approval of a war in Iraq and got it.<br /><br />Bill Clinton, by contrast, sought no approval for any of his raids on<br /><br />Iraq, nor for his strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan. Not that he<br /><br />should have, but Bush went the extra mile to consult Congress,<br /><br />a mile that the law didn't require. The provisions of the War Powers<br /><br />Act specifically give the president the full power to commit forces<br /><br />to battle without asking congressional approval for ninety days,<br /><br />after which he is obliged to ask if he still wants to keep the forces<br /><br />in combat. But Bush chose to ask first--twice.<br /><br />As Enron's auditor, Andersen was expected to be objective<br /><br />and impartial. But the firm was heavily dependent on consulting fees<br /><br />from Enron. (In 2001, for example, Andersen was paid $27 million by<br /><br />Enron for consulting services and $25 million for its audits.) Hiring such<br /><br />a firm for this kind of double duty is a bit like hiring your IRS agent as<br /><br />your personal accountant: He'd inevitably be torn between his desire<br /><br />to collect taxes from you, and his wish to continue to get your fees for<br /><br />his accounting services.	2004-08-01

Just imaging not having to stick to a budget--and you can still amass a nice-sized fortune . . . I did not think it was possible until I read THE AUTOMATIC MILLIONAIRE by David Bach.<br /><br /> But now, I'm not only convinced that it can be done, I strongly recommend that you read this book so you can--to quote the subtitle--[have] A POWERFUL ONE-STEP PLAN TO LIVE AND FINISH RICH.<br /><br /> Bach is perhaps best known for having publicized The Latte Factor . . . this is an internationally recognized metaphor for how we dribble away what should be our fortunes on small things without giving it much thought . . . as he notes in one of his simple, but powerful charts:<br /><br /> A Latte A Day Keeps Retirement Away<br /><br /> A Latte a Day = $3.50<br /><br /> A Latte a Day for a Month = $105.00<br /><br /> A Latte a Day for a Year = $1,260.00<br /><br /> A Latte a Day for a Decade = $12,600.00<br /><br /> Now if you take just $100/month (do as you please with the remaining $5), this saving plan would cost you a total of $48,000 over a 40-year span . . . yet to quote the author, &quot;at even moderate rates of return (say, 6 percent a year), you wind up with $200,145--more than four times the amount you actually put in.&quot; And if you should be able to get a 12 percent return, you'll come out with a nest egg worth some $1,188,242--nearly 25 times worth your total contribution!<br /><br /> There were several other memorable passages; among them:<br /><br /> Now that you have your sign-up package [for your retirement account], you need to decide what percentage of your income you're going to funnel into your retirement account every pay period. In the sign-up package, you'll find a form for you to sign authorizing you employer to deduct your money from your paycheck to fund your retirement account. Most plans will ask you whether you want the amount deducted from your paycheck to be a set percentage of your income or a specific dollar amount. If you have a choice, always select a percentage. That way, when you get a raise and your salary increases, the amount you're putting into your retirement account will automatically increase along with it.<br /><br /> Does investing all of your retirement money in a single fund seem too easy, too good to be true? Even a bit boring? Over the years, as a financial advisor, an investor, and a money coach, I've seen really great markets, so-so markets, and absolutely horrific markets (like the one we just lived through from 2000 through the first quarter of 2003). If I learned one true secret to being an investor who does well in both good times and bad, it is this:<br /><br /> Managing Your Money Should Be Boring!<br /><br /> Of all the secrets to financial security that I share in this book, there are three that stand out in terms of importance and effectiveness.

John Stossel's consumer pieces gave me a lot of good<br />advice and helped me, I'm sure, save many dollars that would<br />have otherwise gone into the dumpster.<br />Yet he often found himself wondering: Why can't government step<br />in and help? \\"The more reporting I did,\\" Stossel writes, \\"the more it dawned on me that the government is often the problem, not the solution.\\"<br />So with that premise in mind, Stossel wrote GIVE ME A BREAK . . . the book's subtitle says it all, \\"How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artis and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media . . . \\"<br />He came to realize that there is nothing government can do that the private sector can't do better, more efficiently and cheaper . . . Stossel believes that we are all being ripped off by excessive taxation, incompetent and bloated bureaucracies, and politicians who make decisions based on self-interest rather than public interest.<br />While I found myself nodding in agreement with most of his points, I didn't agree with everything he wrote . . . for instance, I like histhoughts on extending personal liberty; however, I have my doubts about using to make dwarf-tossing acceptable.<br />Yet that is exactly why GIVE ME A BREAK is so fine . . . it got<br />me thinking, and you'll do the same.<br />There were several memorable passages; just a few of them<br />include the following:<br />Before government lifted its heavy hand, long-distance phone calls cost several dollars a minute. Companies like MCI and Sprint were not permitted to offer lower rates. Today long-distance rates are 70 percent lower-and service is better because of competition.<br />Even if the rats got cancer from smaller doses, it still wouldn't<br />prove that the cranberries were a threat to people, because chemicals that harm animals don't necessarily harm humans. Saccharine was once banned because it caused cancer in rats. But it turned out that saccharine interacts with rat urine in ways that do not apply to humans. People are different from rats. Now we consume vast amounts of saccharine, without harm.<br />Around 1900, America had 6 million farms, and the Agriculture<br />department employed 3,000 people.

Arthur Miller's play, BROKEN GLASS is an interesting psychological mystery set in Brooklyn in 1938 . . . it is about a 45-year-old woman who suddenly loses her ability to walk . . . there is no medical reason why this is happening; the only clue lies in her growing obsession with news accounts from Germany.<br />What I liked most about the taped version BROKEN GLASS was the cast, which included Lawrence Pressman, Linda Purl, JoBeth Williams, and the late David Dukes (who I had really liked as an actor) . . . this work was put out by a group called L.A.

Just when I thought I had slam-dunked a story-ending-just when I was certain the children were safely in the arms of the sandman--a small, sleepy voice would plead, &quot;So, then what happened?&quot; And no matter what I replied, the plea went on, &quot;Please, please, Daddy--tell the rest of the story.&quot;<br />In cranky desperation, I would resort to apocalypse: &quot;Suddenly a<br />comet hit the earth and blew everything to pieces.&quot;<br />Silence. &quot;What happened to the pieces?&quot;<br />&quot;It doesn't matter. Everybody died a horrible death, especially<br />all the little children who were not asleep.&quot; I also tried, &quot;The father sold all the children who would not go to sleep to a passing gypsy who ground them into sausage meat.

If Richard Carlson writes something, I'm going to make it a point<br />to read it . . . His DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF is one of<br />my all-time favorite books, and I also learned from what followed<br />this effort (DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF AT WORK, DON'T<br />SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF FOR MEN and WHAT ABOUT THE BIG<br />STUFF?).<br />I had not previously read one of his earlier efforts, DON'T WORRY, MAKE MONEY, so when a friend asked me if I wanted to borrow it, I said &quot;yes&quot; with great enthusiasm . . . and I'm glad that I did . . . this well might be the best book he ever wrote, but then again, I find myself thinking that after finishing whatever he has written.<br />DON'T WORRY is much more than about how to make money . . . its<br />subtitle perhaps says it all: SPIRITUAL WAYS TO CREATE<br />ABUNDANCE AND MORE FUN IN YOUR LIFE . . . I got soooo<br />many fine ideas here, ranging from dealing with stress caused<br />by my finances to marketing myself professionally--and a whole<br />lot in-between.<br />You may not become a millionaire after reading DON'T WORRY;<br />however , you'll get a lot of practical ways as to what you need<br />to do to take the first step.<br />There were many worthwhile passages; among them:<br />Over and over again I hear people telling me about the book they are going to write, the savings account they are about to open, the business they are going to start, or the charity they are planning to help. But, in many instances, these plans and dreams keep getting put off until &quot;the conditions are right.&quot; One of the most powerful messages I can share with you, one that I'm absolutely certain of, is this: In almost all cases, the conditions you are waiting for will not be significantly different next week or next year. Don't worry that the conditions have to be perfect. The truth is, you are still going to have to take the first step! If you take it now,<br />instead of later, you'll be many steps closer to your dreams by<br />this time next year.<br />My only word of caution is to be sure to get permission before<br />offering your help. Be gentle and patient. Not everyone wants<br />or is ready for help. And that's okay. Don't take it personally.<br />Everyone is at a different place in their life.<br />Consider the amount of mental and emotional energy expended<br />in commiseration. It's a lot. This is energy that could be spent in creative ideas or quiet reflection. This is energy that might be used to solve a problem, implement an idea or market a product. This energy is the source of your abundance. It's yours, and it's free. When you make the decision to stop commiserating, you free up this energy--instantly.

Herb Cohen's YOU CAN NEGOTIATE ANYTHING is my all-time<br />favorite book on negotiations . . . I still recommend it as the<br />absolute best book ever written on the subject.<br />Amazingly, that book was written in 1980 and Cohen did not<br />write a follow-up until now . . . as he notes in the Acknowledgments to his latest effort, NEGOTIATE THIS!, &quot;This book has been incubating in me for some time. To be sure, if you believe in the academic axiom, 'publish or perish,' I would be long dead.&quot;<br />Fortunately, that is not the case. Cohen lives, and that's a great thing because NEGOTIATE THIS! is a worthy successor to his earlier effort . . . it is filled with useful examples and practical advice that is applicable to virtually any negotiation.<br />In fact, that is one of the real strengths of the book; i.e., it will be useful to a wide range of folks--salespeople, diplomats, even parents. (A whole chapter is devoted to them!)<br />The key is to keep in mind the subtitle to NEGOTIATE THIS! . . . you can succeed BY CARING, BUT NOT T-H-A-T MUCH.<br />There were several memorable passages; among them:<br />* Basically, there is a twofold explanation for why we often do not achieve our potential as negotiators. One, as we've seen, is that we are too emotionally involved, caring too much. The second reason is that we have too much authority. What I'm saying is that the last person who should negotiate for a country, corporation, or business is the chief executive officer. Take that one step further and realize that the worst person to negotiate for you is-you. Clearly this presents<br />a practical problem that can be solved by limiting your own authority. Always give yourself room to say, &quot;That sounds good to me but I'll have to check with my board.&quot; If you don't have a board, then substitute the word banker, attorney, adviser, boss, or even spouse.<br />* What is really happening? This experienced salesman was merely<br />playing the game. He knew that offers that come from the side of<br />the mouth in soft tones have 37 percent more credibility that those made in a normal fashion.<br />* Years ago, when I was first employed by a particular government<br />agency, they asked for my fee schedule. At the time, I really wanted this assignment, but we both knew there was no way they could afford my regular price.<br />Then, during a face-to-face meeting, I said, &quot;Honestly, I want to work with you on this. Since I trust you 100 percent, I know you'll get me as much money as you can. Whatever that amount is, I'll still do it.&quot;<br />Two months later when I arrived at their headquarters, I learned<br />from a third party that my negotiating partner had spent endless<br />time and energy looking for ways to increase my fee.

Somehow, I missed reading Dr. Wayne Dyer's TEN SECRETS<br />FOR SUCCESS when it first came out a few years ago . . . however, I'm glad I was able to find it now because<br />it contained many powerful ideas for changing my life--and yours, too, in most likelihood) . . . though a mere 158 pages with a lot of white space, I'd still give it my highest recommendation for either personal reading or gift giving.<br />The ideas may seem pretty basic, but if you read the accompanying<br />explanation in the book, you'll see that they take on a lot more<br />significance when Dyer gives his unique spin on each one:<br />The First Secret:<br />Have a mind that is open to everything and attached to nothing.<br />The Second Secret:<br />Don't die with your music still in you.<br />The Third Secret:<br />You can't give away what you don't have.<br />The Fourth Secret:<br />Embrace silence.<br />The Fifth Secret:<br />Give up your personal history.<br />The Sixth Secret:<br />You can't solve a problem with the same mind that created it.<br />The Seventh Secret:<br />There are no justified resentments.<br />The Eighth Secret:<br />Treat yourself as if you already are what you'd like to be.<br />The Ninth Secret:<br />Treasure your divinity.<br />The Tenth Secret:<br />Wisdom is avoiding all thoughts that weaken you.<br />I also liked how Dyer used a relatively popular technique of<br />introducing each chapter with quotes . . . yet what made these<br />interesting was that I had not seen many of them reviously . . . forinstance:<br />Any path is only a path, and there is no affront to oneself<br />or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart tells<br />you.--Carlos Castaneda<br />Any man can make mistakes, but only an idiot persists<br />in his error.--Cicero<br />The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts. Take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature.--Marcus Aurelius<br />God does not command that we do great things, only little things<br />with great love.--Mother Teresa<br />Also, there were many other memorable passages in the<br />book . . . among them:<br />In all of your relationships, if you can love someone enough to allow them to be exactly what they choose to be--without any expectations or attachments from you--you'll know true peace in your lifetime. True love means you love a person for what they are, not for what you think they should be. This is an open mind-and an absence of attachment.<br />What is your passion? What stirs your soul and makes you feel like you're totally in harmony with why you showed up here in the first place?

List possibilities<br />2. Set A-B-C priorities<br />3. Do the A-1 priority now!<br />And then there's this other bit of advice that I often revisit:  Still not acting? Take a moment and ask Lakein's Question: &quot;What's the best use of your time right now?&quot; Take your first answer as you're A-1. Then do it now!<br />However, despite these negatives, I still liked GIVE ME  A MOMENT--and got a surprising lot out of it.<br />Perhaps most significantly, I got Lakein's premise that &quot;every moment is an opportunity&quot; and &quot;one moment can change your life.&quot;<br />I also liked his ideas on how to make the moment yours and be happier right now, how to enhance your moments at work and play, and how to cultivate more quality moments.<br />There were several other memorable passages; among them:<br />Compliment people if you like what they're wearing. You derive triple pleasure form noticing what you like, sharing your appreciation, and observing their reaction.<br />If your problem isn't cumulative stress but momentary annoyance, adding a plus can remedy the situation. Say you have to make a last-minute trip to the store for a bottle of salad dressing. Instead of resenting the time spent, make the errand a relaxing transition from a hard day at work to a nice evening at home. Anticipate the pleasure of the next few hours with your dinner date.

Ask yourself this: If I were to die tonight, could I tell myself at the instant of my death that I had accomplished everything I had set out to do that day?<br />The secret of happiness, therefore, is to live as if each day<br />was your last. And to live each day to the fullest by doing what you want to do. What you would do if your hours were numbered. Because, realistically, they are. We always seem to realize this when there's little time left. Then it's too late. So you must be courageous enough to act immediately.

Obviously, if your answer is no, you don't like it enough. Tell me, how many people would continue in the same occupation if they suddenly became millionaires? They are few and far between. And those who would answer yes to this question are generally already millionaires. Most of the millionaires I know refuse to retire. They go on working very late in life.

All the time. The question is not to whom do<br />I talk, but who listens?<br />There were many several other memorable passages; among them:<br />The Highest Thought is always that thought which contains joy. The Clearest Words are those words which contain truth. The Grandest Feeling is that felling which you can call love.<br />For the first thing you worry about after saying \\"I love you\\" is whether you'll hear it back. And if you hear it back, then you begin immediately to worry that the love you have just found, you will lose. And so all action becomes a reaction-defense against loss-even as you seek to defend yourself against the loss of God.<br />There is only one purpose for all of life, and that is for you and all that lives to experience fullest glory.	2004-05-17

It was the language of enthusiasm, of things<br />accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for<br />something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange<br />city, and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could<br />conquer the world.<br />&quot;Don't say anything,&quot; Fatima interrupted. &quot;One is loved because<br />one is loved.

Both Democrats and Republicans should read HAD ENOUGH?<br />by James Carville (with Jeff Nussbaum) . . . the noted political<br />adviser takes on George W. Bush and his party's leaders on<br />virtually every front--from the economy to education to foreign<br />affairs.<br />However, what I liked about the book is that it not only<br />attacked; it also laid out \\"had enough\\" solutions for helping<br />the country get back on its feet . . . I also liked its the<br />research that was done . . . every statement that Bush<br />made was documented with respect to when and where he<br />said it.<br />One quote, in particular, stuck with me:<br />That doesn't mean we can't or shouldn't tell people about successes<br />when we see them, but remember my first rule for Democrats to live by:<br />Never just oppose, always propose.<br />Wouldn't that be something we should all try to do in any situation<br />we encounter?<br />There were many other meaningful passages that also got<br />me thinking . . . for example:<br />* Not every agreement suits your interests directly, but often pays to<br />be in rather than out. Which is why it was so amazing to see George<br />Bush take the United States out of six big international agreements in<br />his first six months of office.<br />Here's what they were:<br />The Kyoto Proposal. Signed by the United States, November 12,<br />1998. Abandoned by George Bush, March 2001. . . .<br />The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Signed by Bill Clinton<br />1996.

In force since 1970. Undermined<br />by George Bush since 2001. . . .<br />Protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention. Negotiated by the<br />United States for ten years. Abandoned by George Bush, July 2001. . . .<br />International Criminal Court (ICC). Supported by every American<br />administration since World War II. The Bush administration withdrew<br />our signature from the treaty, May 6, 2002. . . . .<br />Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All<br />Its Aspects. Conceived July 2001. Rejected by George Bush W. Bush<br />outright. . . .<br /><br />* George W. Bush was sworn into office on January 20, 2001. Every day<br />that he has been in office, including the remarkable number of days<br />that he's been on vacation, here's what happened to America under<br />his leadership:<br />The stock market has lost $3.6 billion in shareholder value a day.<br />That's right, every day that this man strutted into the Oval Office,<br />Americans say the value of their savings, pensions, and investments<br />decrease by $3.6 billion.<br />Our fiscal situation has worsened by $9.5 billion a day.<br />Every day he's been in office, 3,409 private sector jobs went down<br />the drain.<br />Every day, 5,114 more people started working part time, because<br />they couldn't find a full-time job.<br />Every day, another 250 people have stopped being counted among<br />the unemployed because they've just plain given up on trying to find a job.<br />You'd think we'd be able to trust them; after all, if there's one thing they know<br />about--it's hurting the economy. I'm not just mouthing off here, either. That<br />statement is empirically true. If you take the last fourteen presidents, you have<br />eight Republicans and six Democrats.

Dyer . . . I'm<br />not sure how he does it, but every time that Dr. Dyer<br />comes out with a new work, he gets me to look at life<br />differently . . . and I come away with countless idea that I<br />want to not only implement personally, but<br />to share with others.<br />The book's subtitle perhaps says it all: Learning to Co-create<br />Your World Your Way . . . I actually feel that I'm starting to<br />do just this, and I've only gone through one reading . . . methinks<br />that I'll be revisiting POWER OF INTENTION many times in<br />the future . . . it is both that good and useful.<br />According to Dr. Dyer, &quot;Intention is a force in the universe, and<br />everything and everyone is connected to this invisible force&quot; . . . he<br />drives this point home repeatedly with true stories and examples . . . I<br />particularly liked his suggestions for implementing the ideas that<br />are found at the end of each chapter.<br />For example, here's one after the first chapter (dealing with<br />&quot;Viewing intention from a new perspective&quot;):<br />Act as if anything you desire is already here. Believe that all that<br />you seek you've already received, that it exists in spirit, and know<br />you shall have your desires filled. One of my ten secrets for success<br />and inner peace is to treat yourself as if you already are what<br />you'd like to become.<br />There were many other memorable passages; among them:<br />Five magic words: I want to feel good! In an earlier chapter, I<br />described how your emotions are a guidance system informing you<br />of whether or not you're creating resistance to your intentions. Feeling<br />bad lets you know that you're not connected to the power of intention.<br />Your intention here is to be tranquil and stress free. When you<br />feel good, you're connected to your intentions, regardless of what<br />goes on around you or what others expect you to feel. If there's a<br />war going on, still have the option to feel good. If the economy goes<br />further into the toilet, you have the option to feel good. In the event<br />of any catastrophe, you can still feel good. Feeling good isn't an<br />indication that you're callous, indifferent, or cruel-it's a choice you<br />make. Say it out loud: I want to feel good! Then convert it to: I intend<br />to feel good. Feel the stress, and then send it the love and respect<br />of the seven faces of intention. The seven faces smile and say hello<br />to what you label as feeling bad. It's that feeling that wants to feel<br />good. You must be to your feelings as your Source is to you, in order<br />to counteract the desires of your ego.<br /><br />Spend some time observing babies, and vow to emulate their joy. You<br />didn't come forth into this world to suffer, to be anxious, fearful, stressful,<br />or depressed. You came from the God-consciousness of joy. Just watch<br />little babies. They've done nothing to be so happy about. They don't<br />work; they poop in their pants; and they have no goals other than to<br />expand, grow, and explore this amazing world. They love everyone,<br />they're completely entertained by a plastic bottle or goofy faces, and<br />they're in a constant state of love-yet they have no teeth, no hair,<br />and they're pudgy and flatulent. How could they possible be so<br />joyful and easily pleased? Because they're still in harmony with the<br />Source that intended them here; they have no resistance to being<br />joyful. Be like that baby you once were in terms of being joyful. You<br />don't need a reason to be happy . . . your desire to be so is sufficient.<br />I suggest that you do a quick review, and note all of the people who've<br />shown up as characters in this play called your life. It has all been<br />perfect. Your ex-spouse showed up at just the right time-when you<br />needed to create those children you love so much. The father who<br />walked out on you so that you could learn self-reliance left right on<br />time. The lover who abandoned you was a part of this perfection. The<br />lover who stayed with you was also taking his or her cues from Source.<br />The good times, the struggles, the tears, the abuse-all of it involved<br />people coming into your life and then leaving. And all of your tears<br />will not and cannot wash out one word of it.<br />Stay immersed in a state of gratitude. Be grateful for every breath<br />you take . . . for all of your internal organs that work together in<br />harmony . . . for the wholeness that is your body . . . for the blood<br />streaming through your veins . . . for your brain that allows you to<br />process these words and the eyes that allow you to read them.<br />Look in the mirror at least once every day and give thanks for that<br />heart that continues to beat and the invisible force on which those<br />heartbeats depend. Stay in gratitude. This is the surest way to keep<br />the connecting link to perfect health clean and pure.doned you was a part of this perfection.

Over dinner, the new acquaintance asked<br />Einstein for his phone number. &quot;Sure,&quot; said Al. He got up,<br />left the table, and walked back toward the phones.<br />&quot;Where is he going?&quot; asked the acquaintance.<br />&quot;I don't know,&quot; said the friend, with a puzzled look on his face.<br />Einstein came back and handed the man a slip of paper with his<br />phone number on it. &quot;My God, you're Einstein!&quot; said the guy.<br />&quot;Why do you have to look up your own phone number?&quot;<br />Einstein said, &quot;Why should I keep in my mind the little things<br />I can find anywhere?&quot;<br />There were several other memorable passages; among them:<br />* Paper flow starts at hand level.

That's where your trash can belongs. If its new<BR>location interferes with your traffic pattern, of course you can make<BR>adjustments. Just be sure it's easy to toss trash from your chair to<BR>the can without bending, leaning or stretching all day long.<br />* Put this sign on your Central Headquarters box: &quot;DO NOT DISTURB!<BR>WET PAINT!&quot;  I'm not kidding! If you don't protect your stuff now, <BR>you won't find it later. And for some reason, this is a sign that gets<BR>people's attention. Who cares it they laugh-at least you'll have<BR>achieved your objective: to keep them out of your stuff.	2004-03-02

It is the story of a man dearly in love<br />with his wife, but who has trouble showing that sentiment. He learns to<br />do so, in part because of the shining example set by his in-laws, Noah<br />and Allie Calhoun, and their 50-year love affair that was so movingly<br />recounted in THE NOTEBOOK).<br />I must admit that I don't cry often; however, this tale did cause me to<br />mist-up at times. A surprise ending further added to my enjoyment.<br />And because I'm roughly the same age as the main character, I<br />do believe that fact helped me further relate to his experiences. Also,<br />I've experienced some of what he went through.<br />Sparks' writing, as always, kept my interest. There were several<br />memorable passages; among them:<br />He smiled. &quot;That's what I mean when I say that I did it for me. Every<br />time I read to her, it was like I was courting her, because sometimes,<br />just sometimes, she would fall in love with me again, just like she<br />had a long time ago. And that's the most wonderful feeling in the<br />world. How many people are ever given that chance? To have<br />someone you love fall in love with you over and over?&quot;<br />Jane, however, had been making my plans difficult to keep. She seemed<br />to enjoy my company. She listened with interest, teased me playfully,<br />and always reached for my hand whenever we were together. The first<br />time she did this, I remember thinking how right it felt. Though if<br />sounds ridiculous, when a couple holds hands, it either feels right or<br />it doesn't. I suppose this had to do with the inter-twining of fingers and<br />the proper placement of the thumb, though when I tried to explain<br />my reasoning to her, Jane laughed and asked me why it was so<br />important to analyze.<br />This week, I hadn't been focusing on my problems and doing my best<br />to correct them. This week, I'd been thinking of her; I'd committed<br />myself to helping her with family responsibilities, I'd listened with<br />interest whenever she spoke, and everything we discussed seemed<br />new. I'd laughed at her jokes and held her as she'd cried, apologized<br />for my faults, and showed her the affection she both needed and<br />deserved. In other words, I'd been the man she'd always wanted, the<br />man I once had been, and--like and old habit rediscovered--I now<br />understood that it was all I ever needed to do for us to begin enjoying<br />each other's company again.o analyze.<br />This week, I hadn't been focusing on my problems and doing my best<BR>to correct them.

I laughed out loud, not once but virtually throughout the book, when<br />reading Ben Stein's HOW TO RUIN YOUR LOVE LIFE . . . he presents 44 easy-to-follow steps that will absolutely<br />do just what it promises.<br />Each step is presented in a short, hysterical essay with such<br />telling titles as &quot;Talk About Yourself Exclusively,&quot; &quot;Make Fun of<br />Your Lover's Family,&quot; &quot;Demand Expensive Gifts From Your Lover,&quot;<br />and &quot;Compare Your Lover With Lovers You've Dated in the Past&quot; . . . then<br />there's arguably the most important one of them all: &quot;If You're<br />Dating Someone Who Has a Lot of Problems, Is Generally a Mess,<br />All of Your friends Dislike Him or Her, Get Married Anyway--Marriage<br />Will Solve All of Your Problems.&quot;<br />I'm not so sure that last statement is true, but I do know that I<br />have learned from this book--and pledge to start doing the opposite<br />as I type . . . also, in thinking about all the useful advice that<br />Stein has provided, my only regret is that I did not have access<br />to this material much earlier in my life!<br />For example, I now know that the following are not exactly what<br />might be considered to be good things to do:<br />* Let's face it: It's really boring to listen to other people's problems. But<br />for other people to hear your problems, now that's truly fascinating.<br />Why is there a difference? Because your problems are about you, and<br />that makes them far more interesting than what anybody else has to<br />say.<br />* You can be confident that your lover will be happy to be frequently told<br />how she can perfect her appearance. People like to be reminded of<br />their flaws--especially by their lovers. And don't forget to pinch her<br />upper arm or her thigh every once in a while to remind her that she's<br />go extra fat in those areas--everyone loves that!<br />* So say anything you like-no matter how hurtful--and when your lover<br />says, &quot;That's a bit rude, isn't it?&quot; respond with an outraged look and a<br />haughty reply, such as: &quot;Oh, I guess I'm not allowed to say anything<br />at all, right?

Heard the taped version of BUILT TO LAST by Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras, a research study that looked at what made certain \\"visionary companies\\" special when compared to others who were \\"successful but second rank\\" . . . thus, Disney was compared to Columbia Pictures, Ford to GM, etc.<br />The comparisons made the material real for me . . . there were lots of examples, and they helped me see that the key to the success of any organization is not just its leader . . . to quote the authors:<br />The key point is that a visionary company is an organization--an institution. All individual leaders, no matter how charismatic or visionary, eventually die; and all visionary products and services--all \\"great ideas\\"--eventually become obsolete. Indeed, entire markets can become obsolete and disappear. Yet visionary companies  prosper over long periods of times, through multiple product life cycles and multiple generations of active leaders.<br />Why that is so is because they did not fall susceptible to the myths that too many other companies buy into, such as:<br />1. It takes a great idea to start a company.<br />2. Visionary companies require great and charismatic visionary leaders.<br />3. The most successful companies exist first and foremost to maximize profits.<br />4. Visionary companies share a common subset of \\"correct\\" core values.<br />5. The only constant is change.<br />6. Blue-chip companies play it safe.<br />7. Visionary companies are great places to work, for everyone.<br />8. Highly successful companies make some of their best moves by brilliant and complex strategic planning.<br />9. Companies should hire outside CEOs to stimulate fundamental change.<br />10. The most successful companies focus primarily on beating the competition.<br />11. You can't have your cake and eat it too.<br />12. Companies become visionary primarily through \\"vision statements.\\"<br />I'd recommend this book to anybody working in business--or who someday aspires to do so . . . it will make you think.you think.	2004-02-27

Everything else is just existing.&quot;<br />I liked that the book really got me thinking about such things<br />as love, friendship, the use of time, temptation (something I'll<br />have to remember the next time I desire a rich dessert), and<br />how to balance my life . . . when certain parts contained<br />too many references to Christ, I did something I used to<br />do when reading Norman Vincent Peale--one of my favorite<br />authors; i.e., I just substituted the word &quot;God.&quot;<br />Also, I liked Warren's use of a thought-provoking question at the<br />end of each chapter . . . for example, this one caught my<br />attention: In what way can I see myself passionately serving<br />others and loving it?<br />There were many other memorable sections; among them:<br />* Hope is as essential to your life as air and water. You need hope<br />to cope. Dr. Bernie Siegel found he could predict which of his<br />cancer patients would go into remission by asking, &quot;Do you want<br />to live to be one hundred?&quot; Those with a deep sense of life<br />purpose answered yes and were the ones most likely to survive.<br />Hope comes from having a purpose.<br /><br />* Every time you try to block a thought out of your mind, you drive it<br />deeper into your memory.

The more you fight a feeling, the more it<br />consumes and controls you.

I liked how<br />she was quite candid about her life . . . in addition, she<br />movingly told many other stories about others who have had<br />to deal with such tragedies as the loss of a child and sudden<br />blindness.<br />I especially liked a section toward the end, in which she described<br />a tradition her parents taught her:<br />As little girls we were always encouraged to count our blessings.<br />Of course what that implies is that no matter what happens, there<br />are always blessings among the day's events to be counted.<br />In my mind, that's what we do when we look for the gifts that change can<br />bring. The last thing I do every night-and have done all my life-is think<br />over what's happened that day, and what I think is going to happen, and<br />then to think of how grateful I am for the things that have happened. I've<br />taught my own children to do the same, and it's a lovely little ritual I often<br />complete with my twins. And I love feeling that I can pass to my children<br />the wonderful, enriching traditions my parents taught to me. Nice end to<br />the day, actually.<br />There were several other memorable passages; among them:<br />All these difficulties have taught me something. As a result of<br />feeling left out and separate, and later of losing my passionate<br />dream of dancing, I began to see that although we don't always<br />have a choice in what happens to us, we really do have a choice<br />in how we react to what's happened. My reaction to being<br />excluded was that I retreated into working hard at what I did.<br />At the Arts Educational School, my parents couldn't afford the<br />education I was getting. I was on a partial grant, and I was so<br />incredibly grateful to be allowed to study what I loved rather than<br />cope with regular school that I did not want to waste one second of<br />my life and wanted to prove it to be the right choice. It's a feeling<br />that's carried over to my life today. How grateful I am to live in<br />the moment.<br />When I was fighting my weight, years ago when I was in my twenties, I<br />used another trick. I realized that the more I thought about the situation,<br />the worse I got. The more I felt I had put myself on a diet, the more I<br />obsessed about food, or rather, about not having food. However, I found<br />that if I put knitting needles in my hands, or if I was embroidering, or<br />even now, if I'm painting, my hands are busy, and it doesn't occur to me<br />to put something in my mouth. When my mind is focused on being creative,<br />the time flies by, and suddenly I think, &quot;Oh my goodness, I haven't eaten<br />anything for three hours.&quot;<br />When she [her mother] returned home and the diagnosis was made,<br />she went right to work on a will. Contrary to what most of us would<br />think, Corinna said, &quot;It was a wonderful, extraordinary exercise. Like<br />being Santa Claus!&quot; I can believe that because I've watched my<br />mother do the same thing, with great joy. At eighty-eight years<br />of age, she lives every day to the fullest, taking advantage<br />of every opportunity and invitation that comes her way, but at the<br />same time she's aware that she won't be here forever. Consequently<br />she's been quite literally gathering up the gifts she has in her life<br />and then slowly handing out treasures she's collected and things<br />she knows we'll value. She's been doing this for the last few years-we've<br />received things like my first ballet shoes or a dance outfit I wore as a girl,<br />an exercise book from school, an award myfather received.

Voting is one of their major forms<br />of entertainment, along with eating dinner at 4:30 p.m. and failing to<br />notice green lights while sitting behind the wheels of their 1986<br />Oldsmobiles. To win the votes of these people, both Al Gore and<br />George W. Bush promised that, if elected, they would have the<br />government give the elderly huge quantities of drugs. So one definite<br />outcome of the election is that, for the next four years, our seniors,<br />God bless them, will be stoned out of their gourds. This will probably<br />improve their driving.<br />Don't get me wrong: I'm all for these recounts. I agree with the thousands<br />of out-of-state lawyers currently clogging every Holiday Inn in the<br />state: We must discern the intent of EVERY VOTER. In fact, I think<br />we should count people who had planned to vote, but, for whatever<br />reason, never got around to actually go to the polls. I think we should<br />count people who failed to register, but have a good excuse, such as they<br />forgot. I think we should count people who live in less-dramatic states<br />such as Delaware, but would have moved to Florida and registered if<br />they had known how exciting this election was going to be.<br />* \\"Mr. Barry,\\" they'll say, \\"this is just a courtesy call to do you the<br />courtesy of interrupting your dinner so I can ask you this question:<br />Would you like to save fifty percent more on your long-distance<br />phone bill?\\"<br />I always say no.

Say only what you mean. Avoid using the<br />word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power<br />of your word in the direction of truth and love.<br />DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY<br />Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a<br />projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are<br />immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the<br />victim of endless suffering.<br />DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS<br />Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really<br />want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid<br />misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one<br />agreement, you can completely transform your life.<br />ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST<br />Your best is going to change from moment to moment, it will be different<br />when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance,<br />simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse<br />and regret.<br />Also, I very much liked this one other passage:<br />Making assumptions in our relationships is really asking for problems.<br />Often we make the assumption that our partners know what we<br />think and that we don't have to say what we want. We assume they<br />are going to do what we want, because they know us so well. If<br />they don't do what we assume they should do, we feel so hurt and<br />say, &quot;You should have known.&quot;ve known.&quot;	2004-01-30

Never give out personal information (such as name, age, home<br />address, phone number, school, town, password, schedule, or<br />your picture) or fill out questionnaires or any forms on-line.<br />2. Never meet in person with anyone you have met on-line without<br />mom and/or dad present.<br />3. Do not enter a chat room without mom and/or dad's presence or<br />supervision. Some &quot;kids&quot; you meet in chat rooms may not really<br />be kids but adults with bad intentions. Remember-people on-line<br />may be very different from who you think they are.<br />4. Be suspicious of anyone who tries to turn you against your parents,<br />teachers, or friends. They may have a hidden agenda.<br />5. Never respond to or send e-mail or instant messages to new people<br />you've met on-line. Talk to your parents first so that they can check<br />out the situation. Never engage in an on-line conversation that makes<br />you feel uncomfortable; log off and tell your parents. If you get such<br />a message, DO NOT respond. Sending a response only encourages<br />the person. Instead, show it to your parents and let them handle it.<br />6. Use Control-H while browsing the Web to see a list of Web sites that<br />have been accessed by your computer in the last few weeks. This<br />can help you determine if your child is visiting any dangerous sites.<br />7. Install filtering software like CYBERsitter, CyberPatrol, or Net Nanny.<br />The software costs about $50 and acts as a digital chaperon,<br />blocking any inappropriate content. These programs work by checking<br />which sites your child visits against a list of disapproved sites, complied<br />by the makers of the software.<br />8. Install software that will actually record images of every Web site that<br />your child visits. The software won't stop them from accessing sites,<br />but it will let you know if you have a problem.

You don't have to be a baseball fan to have fun reading MONEYBALL<br />by Michael Lewis, but if you are one, you'll find this to one of the best<br />sports books you'll ever come across . . . the subtitle says it all:<br />THE ART OF WINNING AN UNFAIR GAME.<br />It tells the story of how the Oakland Athletics compete successfully<br />with such big market teams as the Yankees and Braves, despite<br />having the second-lowest payroll in baseball . . . they do so by<br />paying attention to statistics that nobody had ever really cared<br />about; e.g., the walk--proving that taking a base on balls can often<br />be the difference between winning and losing a game.<br />I loved the wide range of characters, ranging from the team's<br />general manager (Billy Beane, a flop as a player) to statisticians<br />(such as Bill James) and including such low-paid athletes as Scott<br />Hatteberg and Chad Bradford who became stars when nobody<br />else even knew about them.<br />The writing was most captivating . . . among the passages that<br />caught my attention were the following:<br />* The next year went well enough for him-he was, after all, Billy Beane<br />and by the summer of 1982 he had been promoted to the Mets'<br />Double-A team in Jackson, Mississippi. He played left, Strawberry<br />played right, and the whole team played the field. For a lot of the<br />players it was their first exposure to the Southern female-the most<br />flagrant cheater in the mutual disarmament pact known as the feminism.<br />Lipstick! Hairdos! Submissiveness! Baseball was a game but chasing<br />women was a business, in which Billy Beane was designed to succeed<br />without even trying. Billy had the rap. Billy, said his old teammate<br />J.P. Ricciardi, &quot;could talk a dog off a meat wagon.&quot; Billy was forever<br />having to explain to another teammate of his, Steve Springer, that<br />when you'd just met some girl, what you didn't do was tell her you<br />played pro ball. It wasn't fair to her; you had to give the girl a chance<br />to turn you down. Billy's way of giving her a chance was to tell her that<br />what he did for a living was collect roadkill off local highways. Springer<br />didn't have Billy's awesome God-given ability with women; he thought<br />he needed the Mets to stand a chance; and this need of his led to one<br />of those great little moments that make even the most dismal minor<br />league baseball careers worth remembering. They were leaving one of<br />the local burger joints when two pretty girls called after them, in their<br />fetching drawls: &quot;You boys Yankees?&quot; Springer turned around and<br />said, &quot;No, we're the Mets.&quot;<br />* Fielder is the semi-aptly named Prince Fielder, son of Cecil Fielder,<br />who in 1990 hit fifty-one home runs for the Detroit Tigers, and who by<br />the end of his career could hardly waddle around the bases after one<br />of his mammoth shots into the upper deck, much less maneuver him-<br />self in front of a ground ball. &quot;Cecil Fielder acknowledges a weight<br />of 261,&quot; Bill James once wrote, &quot;leaving unanswered the question of<br />what he might weigh if he put his other foot on the scale.&quot; Cecil Fielder<br />could have swallowed Jeremy Brown whole and had room left for<br />dessert, and the son apparently has an even more troubling weight<br />problem than his father. Here's an astonishing fact: Prince Fielder is<br />too fat even for the Oakland A's. Of no other baseball player in the<br />whole of North America can this be said. Pittaro seems to think that<br />the Detroit Tigers might take Fielder anyway, for sentimental reasons.<br />And if the Tigers take him, they trigger a chain reaction that ends with<br />the Mets getting one of their first six choices.<br />* Having kept the team close enough to hope, Billy could now go out<br />and shop for whatever else he needed to get to the play-offs. When<br />he set off on this shopping spree, he kept in mind five simple rules:<br />1. &quot;No matter how successful you are, change is always good.<br />There can never be a status quo. When you have no money<br />you can't afford long-term solutions, only short-term ones. You<br />have to always be upgrading. Otherwise you're fu*ked.&quot;<br />2. &quot;The day you say you have to do something, you're screwed.<br />Because you are going to make a bad deal. You can always<br />recover from the player you didn't sign. You may never recover<br />from the player you signed at the wrong price.&quot;<br />3. &quot;Know exactly what every player in baseball is worth to you. You<br />can put a dollar figure on it.&quot;<br />4. &quot;Know exactly who you want and go after him.&quot; (Never mind who<br />they say they want to trade.)<br />5. &quot;Every deal you do will be publicly scrutinized by subjective<br />opinion. If I'm (IBM CEO) Lou Gerstner, I'm not worried that<br />every personnel decision I make is going to wind up on the front<br />page of the business section.

Don't ask me how you were invited. Either your host<br />is very forgiving or he has a very short memory. Or else he realizes<br />that it was partially his fault. Why else would he be bragging about<br />his new fireproof mattress if he didn't expect you to try it out? And yes,<br />in hindsight it is pretty obvious that just because the mattress is<br />fireproof doesn't mean that the sheets and irreplaceable antique<br />quilt are fireproof as well. Anyway that's all water under the bridge<br />(the same water, in fact, that you threw the burning quilt into to<br />put it out).<br />Anyhoo, you're at the party, you notice an old friend walking toward<br />you, and you start to panic: You've forgotten your friend's name!<br />(I added the exclamation point to make it doubly exciting. Try it<br />yourself. It's fun!) Now, when I say \\"an old friend\\" I mean a friend<br />you've known for a long time, not someone who is really old. Someone<br />really old is not much of a problem because one, by the time they<br />mosey on over to you with their walker you'll have had time to go<br />home, look up their name in your address book, then scurry on<br />back to the party without them noticing.

As soon as you learn and let go, you improve the present.<br />The more you learn from the past, the fewer regrets you have.<br />Only two things can rob you from joy of the present: your<br />negative version of the past or your negative version of the future.<br />You can't change the past, but you can learn from it.<br />It is important to plan for the future if you want the future to be better<br />than the present.	2003-12-23

One day, I wrote on a piece of paper: WHY DO I WRITE?<br />1. The big bucks. It might happen again. You never know.<br />2. The adulation of readers. People coming up in restaurants and<br />saying, &quot;Your stuff cheered my up once during chemo.&quot;<br />3. A cool thing to do. What do you do? I'm a writer. Oh. Cool.<br />4. Am otherwise unemployable. As a nonwriter, I'd need to work<br />as a parking lot attendant or clerk in a convenience store or<br />else be institutionalized for a period of time.<br />5. The inscription on the façade of Northrop Auditorium at the<br />U of M, about the search for truth.<br />6. How many people get the chance to write for The New Yorker<br />magazine? Not many. There are Phi Beta Kappas from Princeton<br />happy to work in the mail room and sharpen pencils and<br />deliver galley proofs. The receptionist is a former Rhodes<br />scholar who sits at work on an article about the spine. If I listen<br />closely, I can hear the ptptptptptpt of her computer keys.<br />7. Want to please my old English teacher, Mr. Hochstetter, who<br />thought I had talent though in retrospect this doesn't say much for<br />his judgment.<br />8. Want to impress women. Shakespeare was out to impress the dark<br />lady, and Keats wrote for Fanny, Wordsworth for his sister Dorothy,<br />and Balzac and Dickens and Hemingway and all those rascals.<br />All of them out to impress the ladies.<br />9. A chance to speak to the youth of tomorrow.<br />10. Big bucks ten to lead to bigger bucks-TV, movies, soft goods.<br />Look and A.A. Milne. He was a hardworking hack, cranking out<br />stuff about the Boer War and motoring and country houses<br />and Bright Young Things, and then he hit on Talking Animals<br />and discovered the importance of subsidiary rights, product,<br />marketing tie-ins.<br />* She said she thought we should make love. New York has that effect<br />on Minnesotans, I guess. You go through the harrowing landing at<br />LaGuardia, skimming over the rooftops of Brooklyn and thinking about<br />the short runway ahead and the one slight miscalculation that sends<br />the plane skittering off the end of the tarmac into Long Island Sound<br />and you'd have to push and kick and punch your way through the<br />panic-stricken mass of passengers to get to the exit row and step<br />on small children to propel yourself out the little window and onto the<br />wing and into the water and paddle to shore, using your seat cushion<br />as a flotation device, and blue lights flashing, the screams of the burned,<br />the drowning, the pounding of helicopters-and then the plane lands<br />and you collect your luggage and ride into the city and by George you're<br />in the mood to take off your clothes and hop into bed.<br />* He turned to me as he shoved the putter in his bag. &quot;Writers like to<br />think that writing is like Arctic exploration or flying the Atlantic solo<br />but actually it's more like golf. You've got to go out and do it every<br />day and live by the results. You can brood over it but in the end you've<br />got to take the club out of the bag and take your swing. You hit the<br />ball to where it wants to go, a series of eighteen small steel cups<br />recessed in turf, on a course that others have traversed before you.<br />You are not the first. You accomplish this by practicing an elegant<br />economy you learned from others and thereby overcoming your<br />damn self-consciousness which trips you up every time.&quot;more like golf.

Heard ONE L, the account by best-selling author Scott Turow<br />(PRESUMED INNOCENT, among others) of his first year at<br />Harvard Law School . . . although he was a student some<br />25 years before he wrote the book, it still gave me a gripping<br />account of what being a law student then was all about . . . and<br />though I've never attended law school, friends have told me<br />that much of his account still holds true; i.e., it is certainly not<br />an easy experience.<br />I particularly enjoyed Turow's account of his various professors and<br />why he liked some--and detested authors . . . in the latter category,<br />he placed this one individual who had this to say on the first day<br />of class:<br />It is the hardest course you'll take. . . . I am not an easy person.<br />I expect you to be here every day. . . . I expect you to be very<br />well prepared every day. I want to be absolutely clear on that. I<br />have never heard the word &quot;pass.&quot; I do not know what unprepared<br />means.<br />Now and then, there are personal problems. We all have these<br />at times, which will make full preparation impossible. If that is the<br />case, I then want a written note handed to my secretary at least<br />two hours before class.<br />Now, personally, I'm not sure that I will ever go that far in addressing<br />my students at the beginning of the semester . . . yet that said, I<br />do like the one part about expecting students to be very well<br />prepared for each class . . .

Enjoyed EVERY SECOND COUNTS, Lance Armstrong's<br />follow-up to IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE . . . this second book<br />details how he has continued to beat incredible odds (after<br />having been diagnosed with testicular cancer).<br />He has now won an incredible record-tying five Tour de France<br />titles, while also overseeing the Lance Armstrong Foundation--a<br />nonprofit organization that assists cancer patients around the world<br />with managing and surviving the disease.<br />Also, he has a busy endorsement career . . . and with three<br />young children, he seems to accomplish in a day more than<br />most of us accomplish in a week or month.<br />I very much liked two things about this effort: 1) its descriptions<br />of actual races that made the sport come alive, even though I don't<br />even ride a bike; and 2) its brutal honesty about how his life<br />and career have taken a toll on his marriage, though there appears<br />hope that things may eventually work out for Armstrong and his wife.<br />While reading, I came across several memorable passages; among them:<br />* But the fact is that I wouldn't have won even a single Tour de France<br />without the lesson of illness. What it teaches is this: pain is temporary.<br />Quitting lasts forever.<br />To me, just finishing the Tour de France is a demonstration of survival.<br />The arduousness of the race, the sheer unreasonableness of the job,<br />the circumnavigation of an entire country on a bicycle, village to<br />village, along its shores, across its bridges, up and over the mountain<br />peaks they call cols, requires a matchless stamina. The Tour is so<br />taxing that Dutch rider Hennie Kuiper once said, after a long climb up<br />an alp, &quot;The snow had turned black in my eyes.&quot; It's not unlike the<br />stamina of people who are ill every day. The Tour is a daily festival<br />of human suffering, of minor tragedies and comedies, all conducted<br />in the elements, sometimes terrible weather and sometimes fine,<br />over flats, and into headwinds, with plenty of crashes. And it's three<br />weeks long. Think about what you were doing three weeks ago. It<br />feels like last year.<br />The race is very much like living-except that its consequences are<br />less dire and there's a prize at the end. Life is not so neat.<br />There was no pat storybook ending for me. I survived cancer and made<br />a successful comeback as a cyclist by winning the 1999 Tour, but that<br />was more of a beginning than an end. Life actually went on, sometimes<br />in the most messy, inconvenient, and untriumphant ways. In the next<br />five years I'd have three children, take hundreds of drug tests (literally),<br />break my neck (literally), win some more races, lose some, too, and<br />experience a breakdown in my marriage. Among other adventures.<br />* Mortal illness, like most personal catastrophes, comes on suddenly.<br />There's no great sense of foreboding, no premonition, you just wake<br />up one morning and something's wrong in your lungs, or your liver,<br />or your bones. But near-death cleared the decks, and what came<br />after was a bright, sparkling awareness: time is limited, so I better<br />wake up every morning fresh and know that I have just on chance<br />to live this particular day right, and to string my days together into<br />a life of action, and purpose.<br />If you want to know what keeps me on my bike, riding up an alp for<br />six hours in the rain, that's your answer.<br /><br />* In February of 2003, Kik and I agreed to a trial separation, and we<br />entered marriage counseling. I moved into my one-room cabin at<br />Milagro, the small ranch that I had cleared and planted with a soft<br />green lawn. I sat on a rocking chair on the porch and cast around for<br />the specific cause of our marital difficulties, but they were cloudy<br />to me. All I knew was that in trying to do everything, we'd forgotten<br />to do the most important thing. We forgot to be married. It was like<br />being in a current you didn't know was there. One day we looked<br />up and realized we'd been swept downstream from our landmarks,<br />all the points of reference.<br />People warn you that marriage is hard work, but you don't listen.<br />You talk about the pretty bridesmaids' dresses, but you don't talk<br />abut what happens next; about how difficult it will be to stay, or<br />to rebuild.

You'll be finished sooner not just<br />by working harder to fill it but also by choosing a smaller box.<br />Becky considers herself normal in most respects. She has a career,<br />a husband, two children, and almost no time.<br />&quot;Do you ever feel like you woke up in an episode of Twilight Zone?<br />My story is the person who constantly has more things to do and<br />less time in which to do it. It's like every day I have to make more<br />runs to the store than the day before, and I have to do it in half<br />the time.&quot; Becky concluded that the key to living life at her own pace,<br />instead of in a rushed hurry, was &quot;to realize what is really important.<br />I spent so much time doing things because I thought I was supposed<br />to instead of because they were really necessary.&quot;<br />To get out of her Twilight Zone, Becky stopped going after everything.<br />&quot;If you run out of time trying to do absolutely everything, then some-<br />times you wind up finishing the stupid stuff and missing out on what<br />really matters.&quot;<br />* No matter what your career dream, it will at some point cause conflict<br />in your home life. It is easier to pretend these conflicts do not exist<br />or to dodge the matter whenever possible. But ignoring conflict doesn't<br />make it go away; it just feeds the conflict and makes it worse.<br />Discuss conflicts between your work life and your home life because<br />that is the only way you can make the situation better.<br />The Coalition for Marriage, Family, and Couples Education teaches<br />people that the surest path to resentment, strain, and relationship<br />disaster is the complete absence of disagreements. Having on<br />disagreements means you aren't saying what you think and feel<br />and that emotions will simmer within you until they reach a boil.<br />One of the coalition's main lessons is that in any relationship there<br />are &quot;ten irreconcilable differences.&quot;<br />According to Dianne Sollee, the director of the coalition,<br />&quot;The problem for most people is that they<br />don't recognize that differences are inevitable and should be talked<br />about, and they instead seek refuge from another relationship. Of<br />course, their new relationship will have ten new irreconcilable<br />differences, and the pattern will just be repeated.&quot;<br />Healthy relationships are successful, not because people have fewer<br />disagreements, but because they apply problem-solving skills to<br />arguments. Dianne says, &quot;Instead of an emphasis on who is right<br />and who is wrong, the underlying emphasis in healthy relationships<br />is on what can be done to improve the situation for everyone involved.&quot;<br />* People don't buy houses or cars if they're not sure about every detail.<br />It's too important to rush into that kind of commitment.

The odd inkblots against the<br />blue, floating curiosities twenty feet wide and filled with exploding<br />steel. Long white contrails in formation, road maps for German<br />fighters. A plane, severed at the waist, that made your heart stop.<br />Count the chutes. And breaking radio silence, shouting wildly at the<br />doomed crew to bail out, bail out. It was the worst thing you had ever<br />witnessed, and when it was over there was no place to put it.

Heard the taped version of THE SOUTH BEACH DIET, written<br />and read by Dr. Arhtur Agatston . . . I liked that he developed<br />it first for himself and actually used it.<br />Also, I liked the fact that it is less restrictive than the Atkins<br />diet . . . nor is it overly complicated, and it doesn't seem to<br />require you to go hungry.<br />If you try it, you can eat normal size helpings of meat, poultry<br />and fish. You'll further eat eggs, cheese, nuts, and vegetables.<br />Snacks ARE required. And you'll learn to avoid the bad carbs,<br />such as white flour, white sugar and baked potatoes.<br />Best of all, people who follow it seem to lose weight--with<br />stubborn belly fat being the first to go!	2003-11-29

Maybe we<br />could have fixed things early on before they became irreparable.&quot;<br />* I continued. &quot;I grew up in Michigan, so I'm very aware of the<br />automotive industry. I was impressed with their rallying call<br />'Quality is job one.' To most people this sounds like they're saying,<br />'Quality is the most important job.' And they are. But it's also a<br />message that conveys deeper meaning. Most people don't know<br />this, but job one is the term for the prototype of each model-the<br />first car off the assembly line. This car has to be perfect because<br />it is the standard against which all of the other cars are built. When<br />workers at Ford Motors first heard 'Quality is job one,' what they<br />really heard was that every car they produced had to be perfect, held<br />to the standard of the first job-the first car off the assembly line.<br />They had a clear picture of what quality looks like. The rallying call<br />also told them that they are going to seriously compete with the<br />Japanese market in the area of quality. There was a lot of meaning<br />attached to their rallying call, and it connected them to a shared vision.<br />That was the year that the Ford Taurus overtook the Honda Accord as<br />the best-selling car in that class.&quot;<br />* We agreed that a rallying call is a great way to encapsulate the messages<br />of a shared vision. We thought of examples where the rallying call of a<br />company was a true expression of their vision, such as Ritz-Carlton's<br />&quot;We are ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen&quot; and<br />Disney's &quot;to keep the same smiles on people's faces when they leave<br />the park that they had when they entered six, eight, or twelve hours<br />earlier,&quot; and Steve Job's vision to make computers accessible and<br />affordable for everyone by creating a world with &quot;a computer on every<br />desk.&quot;This car has to be perfect because<BR>it is the standard against which all of the other cars are built.

With no time-outs, twenty<br />yards to go, eighteen seconds left, Neely sent two receivers wide, and<br />took the snap in the shotgun. He quickly handed off to Marcus Mabry on<br />a draw. Marcus took three steps, then abruptly stopped and pitched the<br />ball back to Neely, who sprinted to his right, pumping the ball as if he<br />would finally throw it. When he turned upfield, the offensive line released<br />and sprinted forward, looking for someone to level. At the ten, Neely,<br />running like a mad man, lowered his head and crashed into a linebacker<br />and a safety, a collision that would have knocked out a mere mortal. He<br />spun away, free but dizzy, legs still churning, got hit again at the five, and<br />again at the three where most of the East Pike defense managed to<br />coral him. the play was almost over, as was the game, when Silo Mooney<br />and Barry Vatrano slammed into the mass of humanity hanging on<br />Neely, and the entire pile fell into the end zone. Neely sprang to his feet,<br />still clutching the ball, and looked directly at Eddie Rake, twenty feet away,<br />motionless and non-committal.<br />&quot;It was silly. Grown men crying after a loss. The entire town living and<br />dying with each game. prayer breakfasts every Friday morning, as if God<br />cares who wins a high school football game. More money spent on the<br />football team that on all other student groups combined. Worshiping<br />seventeen-year-old boys who quickly become convinced they are truly<br />worthy of being worshiped. The double standard-a football player cheats<br />on a test, everybody scrambles to cover it up. A nonathlete cheats, and<br />he gets suspended. The stupid little girls who can't wait to give it up to<br />a Spartan. All for the good of the team. Messina needs its young virgins<br />to sacrifice everything. Oh, and I almost forgot. The Pep Girls!

Scott Berg's previous biographies (MAX PERKINS:<br />EDITOR OF GENIUS, GOLDWYN: A BIOGRAPHY and LINDBERGH),<br />so naturally I looked forward to reading his latest: KATE REMEMBERED.<br />Yet this effort was a bit different from his other efforts . . . to quote<br />from the Author's Note, &quot;This book is . . . not a critical study of either<br />Katharine Hepburn's life or her career. It is, rather as true an account<br />of her life as I can present, based on countless hours of private<br />conversations during which she reminisced . . . And so, more than<br />my remembrances, this book intends to convey hers.&quot;<br />Berg met Hepburn in 1983 and remained close friends with her<br />until the end of her life . . . he describes their many quiet<br />dinners in her New York City town house, winter swims at her<br />Connecticut home and unusual appearances by such notables<br />as Warren Beatty and Michael Jackson . . . Berg also gives<br />insight into Hepburn's relationships with both Spencer Tracy<br />and Howard Hughes.<br />In reading, I really feel that I got to know Hepburn better . . . it<br />almost felt that I was there with her, listening in on some of<br />her conversations.<br />One, in particular, made me laugh out loud . . . when Berg first<br />met her, she asked him if he wanted to use the bathroom . . . he<br />said &quot;no&quot; . . . she then asked if he was really sure . . . so he<br />decided to use the bathroom and sure enough, he had to<br />go . . . Hepburn was not surprised, telling him that after all,<br />her father was a urologist.<br />There were many other memorable passages; among them:<br />* [on having children] She proceeded to illustrate her main point.<br />\\"Let's say I have a little child,\\" she explained, \\"and it's<br />seven o'clock at night and Baby Johnny or Baby Janey<br />suddenly comes down with a one-hundred-and three-degree<br />fever. And I've go twelve hundred people waiting to see me that night<br />at the St. James Theatre. Now some of those people, I'm thinking, have<br />waited months for their tickets, and some of them have scraped<br />together money they can't  really afford and arranged baby-sitters<br />so that they can have their special night that year. And now little<br />Johnny or little Janey is in pain and screaming and yelling. And there's<br />no question what I have to do. I would walk into that baby's room, and<br />take a pillow, and smother that adorable child!\\"<br />* At one point, Hepburn-whom some wags in town had by then dubbed<br />\\"Katharine of Arrogance\\"-suggested that she play both roles. \\"But if<br />you play both queens,\\" asked John Carradine, a favorite Ford player who<br />had a supporting role in the film, \\"how would you know which on to<br />upstage?\\" Hepburn found nothing amusing about the comment at the<br />time. Years later she roared with laughter telling it.<br /><br />* Kate was never one to speak in abstractions. For all her wisdom,<br />she was seldom one to philosophize. But in my last long<br />conversation with her, the evening of her nephew Munday's<br />marriage--when we were alone and she seemed strangely<br />pensive--I could not resist asking, &quot;So what do you think it's all<br />about? Life, I mean. What's the purpose? What are we doing<br />here?&quot;<br />I would have felt embarrassed asking such trite questions had Kate<br />not spared me by answering without hesitation, &quot;To work hard,&quot; she<br />said, &quot;and to love someone.&quot; Then she paused.<br />But that was not all. &quot;and to have some fun,&quot; she added. &quot;And if<br />you're lucky, you keep your health . . . and somebody loves you back.&quot;those people, I'm thinking, have<BR>waited months for their tickets, and some of them have scraped<BR>together money they can't  really afford and arranged baby-sitters<BR>so that they can have their special night that year.

In a letter to his sister in 1947,<br />Truman wrote: &quot;All the President is, is a glorified public relations man<br />who spends his time flattering, kissing, and kicking people to get<br />them to do what they are supposed to do anyway.&quot;<br />* As Elizabeth Dole's fame and power grew over the years, even to<br />the point of being-with her husband-a front-runner for George<br />Bush's choice of a vice president, Bob Dole was utterly undisturbed.<br />When she was appointed Secretary of Transportation, Dole<br />remembered, &quot;There were a lot of stories and a lot of pictures taken.<br />I was always in the picture, but I was never identified.

I had previously thought that Buddhism and<br />entrepreneurism were terms that didn't even belong in the same<br />sentence; however, this book proved me wrong.<br />In addition, it confirmed for me the fact that PR-type folks sometimes<br />don't know what they're talking about . . . when coming up with<br />a name for the bakery, many advised against any mention<br />of the Zen tie-in . . . Glassman disagreed, though, because<br />he felt that to hide the fact would be not consistent with his<br />value system . . . he fortunately won out.<br />My only criticism: I would have liked to have seen a few<br />more actual lessons; i.e., suggestions that I could apply<br />to my daily life along the lines of the following one that<br />I did recall:<br />As with time, there's almost always enough money to<br />start the process [of starting a business or virtually<br />anything else].	2003-08-25

I quickly became interested in<br />Rapp's character, particularly because he had a human<br />side to him . . . he even gets married, and some of the<br />troubles that this causes him actually had me<br />chucking . . . such as: how do you explain a bullet<br />wound to your bum when you've supposedly been on<br />the sidelines directing a rescue attempt?<br />My only disappointment was in the way that the other<br />major character, an unknown assassin, gets written out of the<br />story toward the very end . . . nice guy that I am, I won't mention<br />how . . . yet when that happened, I somewhat lost interest . . . the<br />ending also left something to be desired, in that it attempted to<br />bring together several subplots in too abrupt a fashion.	2003-08-18

Paul Madriani, the defense attorney from other<br />books by the author (COMPELLING EVIDENCE and PRIME<br />WITNESS) returns to another case involving murder and deceit--but<br />this time in his own family . . . there were many twists and turns,<br />and what looked like the obvious became not so certain as the<br />tale unfolded . . .

If so, then read THE ULTIMATE COMPETITIVE<br />ADVANTAGE by Donald Mitchell and Carol Coles.<br />I think the book's subtitle says it all: SECRETS OF DEVELOPING A<br />MORE PROFITABLE BUSINESS MODEL! . . . the authors not<br />just describe it; they also show you how to implement it.<br />There are lots of examples given, applicable to most any<br />situation (small- to large-sized business, nonprofit, etc.) . . . I also<br />liked the series of thought-provoking questions at the end<br />of most chapters.<br />For example: How can a better price structure expand the<br />market faster? Mitchell and Cole, in discussing the<br />answer, cite American Online when it first shifted<br />from a time-related charge to a fixed fee for unlimited<br />usage . . . the market expanded so rapidly that the<br />company had to struggle to keep up with the demand . . . I<br />remember that period, too . . . and even though I despised<br />the level of service I was getting for a very short period of<br />time, I'd still take it when I recall how much my bills used to be.<br />There were several other memorable passages; among them:<br />Think about the last time you unsuccessfully looked for a misplaced<br />object. What did you do? Chances are you kept reexamining the same<br />places. If you didn't find it in a particular place the first time, is it<br />likely to be there the second time? Or the third? Your passing gaze<br />may have briefly focused on other areas, but they remained unsearched.<br />When you expanded your search to these other areas, you found<br />what you were looking for. Eureka! You enjoyed your success and<br />a great sense of relief. Drawing on that experience, you will find that<br />your odds of success with business model innovation are also increased<br />if you begin by looking in places where you have not yet searched.<br />Another prime opportunity is to ask different questions. For example,<br />a good role-playing alternative is to perform the same analysis . . .<br />except from the perspective of imagining that you work for each of<br />your competitors and potential competitors. You can profitably do<br />something similar by imagining that you work for complementary<br />companies that you might acquire.<br />How do you know if your organization's values aren't sufficient? A<br />good visceral test is to ask yourself if you feel inspired and proud<br />to do your job because of what your company stands for. If you<br />don't feel that inspiration and pride, what would have to change<br />about the company and its relationships for you to feel that way?<br />Ask others those same two questions in private, and listen carefully<br />to what the respondents tell you.alternative is to perform the same analysis . . . <br />except from the perspective of imagining that you work for each of<BR>your competitors and potential competitors.

FIELDS, a biography by James Curtis about one<br />of the greatest comedians in the world . . . his career spanned the<br />whole of the twentieth century--in burlesque, vaudeville, the<br />legitimate stage, silent pictures, talkies, radios, books, and<br />recordings . . . only his death prevented him from also working<br />in television.<br />Fields was a man of contradictions . . . he could write brilliant<br />dialogue, yet manage to ad lib something hilarious . . . he was<br />generous with friends, though incredibly stingy with his own<br />family . . . he could be a pleasure to work with at times, but quite<br />often, he was a real pain in the (bottom).<br />I hadn't know all that much about him . . . now I do and found out<br />that his drinking was actually even worse than I had heard about.<br />A series of accompanying photos from different aspects<br />of Fields' life contributed to my enjoyment of this book.<br />There were several memorable passages; among them:<br />Comedy, Bill Fields would say, is truth--a bit of artful reality,<br />expressed in action or words, carefully exaggerated and brought to<br />a surprise finish. Fields didn't think the mechanics of a gag counted<br />for half as much as the sound behind it. You might coax a laugh<br />from a willing audience over most anything, but a gag wouldn't be<br />memorable without the delight of human recognition.<br />Booze had not yet become and integral part of the act, but Fields<br />made such bald-faced exaggerations in print that he was widely<br />thought to have an unlimited capacity. \\"I'm and advocate of<br />moderation,\\" he told Jack Grant in Movie Classic magazine.<br />\\"For example, I never drink before breakfast. During the morning,<br />I have 15 or 20 highballs. Then comes lunch. But I don't eat<br />lunch. Bad for the waistline. I drink it instead-oh say, a gallon<br />of cocktails.  In the afternoon, which is longer that the morning, I<br />have possibly 30 or 40 highballs. With dinner, I have ten or twelve<br />bottles of wine or something to drink. In the evening, like a case<br />of sherry or maybe 50 to 60 highballs.\\" A more reliable account<br />of Fields' drinking came in 1951 from Norman McLeod. \\"After<br />breakfast he downed a solid glass of bourbon with one-half inch<br />of water in it,\\" he told columnist Ezra Goodman. \\"He said he didn't<br />want to discolor the bourbon. He had four or five of these until<br />noon, He drank on the set. He was on of the few actors I knew of<br />who was allowed to drink on the set. Then he had lunch. After<br />lunch-he always ate big meals-he began imbibing again at 2:30.<br />He would have four or five more bourbons until 5 p.m. At 5 p.m.<br />he started on martinis. He'd have five or six martinis-he made a<br />very good martini-before dinner. He was never drunk unless<br />he consumed liquor after dinner. If he did, he went back to bourbon.\\"<br />[Spec McClure, Hedda Hopper's leg man]<br />Fields was the only man or woman I ever saw who stopped the whole<br />set when he went into a scene. I remember one scene-a rather long<br />shot-at 20th in which the idiot board could not be used, nor could<br />Fields remember his lines. So on each take he simply improvised,<br />making each one vastly different. The usually bored crew, technicians,<br />and everybody else on the stage crowded close to observe the maestro<br />as he went into action. I have also seen him so drunk that two men<br />were required to get him into position on the set, but when \\"action\\"<br />was called he marvelously came to life and went through the<br />scene without a hitch. An assistant stood on the sidelines with<br />a quart malted-milk glass filled with martini in case Fields got<br />thirsty. This was no gag, as everyone had great respect for the<br />old trouper and nobody thought his leaning on gin funny. Of<br />course, never wrote up such things as I could feel the life<br />weariness in the man-and I'd never been let back on the stage<br />if I had.	2003-08-04

The names go into one of the attic rooms<br />of my brain and lodge there. As I once knew all stats on Joe<br />DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle, I now try to know all the stats<br />on my top thousand customers. Because that's the game:<br />knowing the customer.<br />A hug can be a thoughtful remedy for an annoyance. When the<br />Postal Service raised the price of a stamp to 37 cents from 34 cents,<br />my first thought was, &quot;Oh, great, now I've got to stand in line to get<br />3-cent stamps so I can use that mound of 34-cent stamps I bought<br />so I wouldn't have to wait in line for a long time.&quot; I hate waiting<br />in lines, especially at a government agency. But who doesn't? So<br />I sent out a personal note to five hundred of our good customers,<br />thinking they might be in the same boat, and included some 3-cent<br />stamps. &quot;You know you are the focus of our business,&quot; I wrote.<br />&quot;In an effort to make your life less hectic, I have enclosed a<br />handful of 3-cent stamps.&quot; It was a hug out of nowhere, and they<br />loved it.<br />Consistency means that if you're going to do anything for the customer,<br />you have to do it for everyone, including someone you've never seen<br />before. That means that a customer is more important than a<br />mannequin. One Saturday years ago, Mitchells was really mobbed,<br />and this couple came in who had never been there before. The wife<br />asked if we had a certain tie in a green coloration. I flipped<br />through the tie racks and couldn't find it. The woman nodded at<br />a mannequin and said, &quot;There it is.&quot; So I got up and removed it and<br />took if downstairs to be steamed. Meanwhile, the couple browsed<br />around and wound up buying several suits, a couple of sport jackets,<br />and twenty-three custom shirts. As they were checking out, the woman<br />said, &quot;We were in a store in Stamford before we came here, and there<br />was a tie on the mannequin that I liked and I asked the manager if he<br />could take it off, and he said, 'Absolutely not, the visual department<br />is coming out from New York today and the visuals have to be<br />perfect.' &quot;ice of a stamp to 37 cents from 34 cents,<BR>my first thought was, &quot;Oh, great, now I've got to stand in line to get<BR>3-cent stamps so I can use that mound of 34-cent stamps I bought<BR>so I wouldn't have to wait in line for a long time.&quot; I hate waiting<BR>in lines, especially at a government agency.

I have enough money to last the rest of my<br />life. Unless I want to buy something.\\"<br />There were many other memorable parts; among them:<br />I had to work harder to get attention.

McCain did the narration, and that<br />had a lot to do with why I liked it so much . . . it felt that he was<br />speaking to me directly . . . I also got to know much more about<br />McCain's career after his Vietnam captivity . . . he pulls no<br />punches, talking about his friendship with John Tower and the<br />subsequent babble over Tower's nomination for defense<br />secretary . . . similarly, he revisits the \\"Keating Five\\" affair that<br />nearly wrecked his career in the early 1990s . . . yet both most<br />amazing and refreshing was his candid admission that he lied<br />during his 2000 run for the presidency . . . when asked about<br />the Confederate flag, he first did not tell the truth about his<br />background . . . he then compounded this mistake by not<br />divulging how he really felt about the subject.<br />Yet that said, I think the following quote from the book provides insight into<br />what John McCain is all about: \\"A rebel without a cause is just a<br />punk.

Sarno . . . so<br />after he lent it to me, I decided to give it a try.<br />The premise is interesting; i.e., that you can overcome back<br />problems without drugs or dangerous therapy . . . however, I'm<br />not sure that I bought into all that Sarno has to say<br />on the subject . . .  his contention is that many people<br />who are kept from living a full life suffer from something known<br />as TMS (Tension Myostis Syndrome) . . . and that this condition<br />is primarily brought about by emotional conditions, including<br />anxiety and repressed anger.<br />According to Sarno, the mind tricks you into not facing repressed<br />emotion by making you focus on pain in the body. When this<br />realization sinks in (&quot;and it must sink in, for mere intellectual<br />appreciation of the process is not enough&quot;), the trick doesn't work<br />any more, and there's no need for the pain.<br />My major disappointment in the book was that it lacked<br />specifics . . .

Heard the taped version of SEVEN UP, Janet Evanovich's seventh<br />novel about bounty hunter Stephanie Plum . . . I haven't read every<br />entry in the series, but it did not matter . . . this can be enjoyed with or<br />without having read the other books . . . I did, in large part<br />because it is set (as is always the case) in nearby Trenton,<br />New Jersey--so I could relate to many of the spots that are<br />mentioned.<br />Plum, this time, has to bring in an elderly cigarette smuggler who<br />keeps giving her the slip . . . at the same time, she must deal with<br />such other matters as who stole a rump roast from two neighborhood<br />potheads . . . . and, perhaps most importantly, she must decide<br />what should she do about the wedding dress being held for her as<br />she makes up her mind whether vice cop Joe Moreli is really<br />the one for her.<br />Don't come to this expecting a serious, somber mystery . . . but<br />if you'd like to smile when you do your reading, then Evanovich<br />is the writer for you . . . her dialogue is especially catchy, as<br />evidenced by this one exchange:<br />I did look good in the gown. I looked like Scarlett O' Hara getting<br />ready for a big wedding at Tara. I moved around a little to simulate<br />dancing.<br />\\"Jump up and down so we can see how it'll look when you do the<br />bunny hop,\\" Grandma said.<br />\\"It's pretty but I don't want a gown,\\" I said.<br />\\"I can order one in her size at no obligation,\\" Tina said.<br />\\"No obligation,\\" Grandma said. \\"You can't beat that.\\"<br />\\"As long as there's no obligation,\\" my mother said.<br />I needed chocolate. A lot of chocolate. \\"Oh gee,\\" I said, \\"look<br />at the time. I need to go.\\"<br />One more thing I enjoyed was the ending, something not<br />the case in far too many mysteries . . .

Anita Shreve, one of my favorite novelists, again scores with<br />her latest: ALL HE EVER WANTED . . . one thing I really like about<br />her is that ever book seems different . . . she just doesn't follow<br />the formulaic approach used by many writers to come up with<br />essentially the same story.<br />This particular tale of unrequited love is set in New Hampshire<br />in the early 1900s . . . it involves a college professor who meets,<br />by accident, a woman and then sets out to marry her . . . he<br />does reach his goal, but does he really? . . . that is the question<br />that I'm still thinking about, long after I finished the last page.<br />Shreve really gives you a feel for what living in New England in a<br />small college town must have been like . . . she also has the<br />male perspective down pat (it is written from the professor's<br />standpoint) . . . and I especially liked a section wherein the plot<br />was moved along by a series of letters between two of the characters.<br />For example, here's part of one such correspondence:<br />Your husband has sent round a note just now asking me to your house<br />for a drink at half past five o'clock tonight. I feel I cannot decline, but<br />wish I could speak with you on the matter before I go. I look forward<br />to seeing you should you be there this evening. In the matter to which<br />we have been referring in our previous correspondence, let me just say<br />that the sight of your face on that morning so many years ago has<br />remained for me a standard by which I judge my own affection<br />for any woman with whom I am close, and the affection of any<br />woman for me. I count you among the most fortunate of persons<br />to have felt so strongly for another human being, however<br />unhappy the outcome. Is this not the point of our existence?<br />Yet the writing throughout is equally compelling, as evidenced<br />by these two other parts:<br />Though Etna asserts that her love was genuine, it is Asher who speaks<br />of passion. &quot;The ferocity of love that lies behind the veil of polite<br />comportment,&quot; he writes. And this: &quot;The sight of your face on that<br />morning so many years ago has remained for me a standard by which<br />I judge my own affection of any woman with whom I am close, and the<br />affection of any woman for me. I count you among the most fortunate<br />of persons to have felt so strongly for another human being, however<br />unhappy the outcome. Is this not the point of our existence?&quot;<br />I pondered also the nature of fate and circumstance. Had it not been<br />for the fire, I doubt I should ever have met Etna Bliss. Did I now wish<br />that those few drops of oil in the hotel kitchen had not fallen onto<br />the cooking fire? Might I have eaten my poached sole in solitude and<br />never noticed the young woman in the topaz silk sitting behind me<br />and thus escaped both the joy and anguish of the next fifteen years,<br />only to have met, two months later, say, the daughter of a rare-book<br />dealer from Thrupp whom I then married? Might I never have encountered<br />Etna Bliss at all, but rather have seen a woman emerging from a trolley<br />three days later to whom I gave pursuit and was ultimately betrothed?<br />Or have been introduced at a faculty party at the college to the wife<br />of a colleague (no, never; the sentence does not bear completion, for<br />I should never have stooped so low) . . . or chance upon, in twenty years'<br />time, after having remained of decades a bachelor, a widow to whom<br />my academic credentials, not to mention my modest fortune, might<br />have been attractive? Or, then again, might I actually have met a worse<br />fate that was dealt to me? Might I have wed the daughter of a physician<br />who bore me a child who then died as a result of my wife's carelessness?<br />There are stories more terrible than mine. I do understand this. But<br />the influence of circumstance upon a man's destiny is considerable,<br />is it not?	2003-06-30

GEORGE FOREMAN'S GUIDE TO LIFE by George Foreman<br />with Linda Kulman is a short book (124 pages) that surprised me in<br />all that it had to offer.<br />I wasn't expected much from it, given that Foreman on the surface<br />wouldn't seem to be the ideal role model to write a self-help book . . . he<br />was a bully, of sorts, when a kid . . . he didn't read his first<br />whole book until the age of 16 . . . and he was married and<br />divorced four times, only to find his fifth time to be the charm.<br />Furthermore, after he lost the heavyweight title for the first time,<br />he became a recluse of sorts . . . he also had a reputation for<br />being surly and mean-tempered, as unlikely as it now seems<br />when you see him pitching products on TV or doing boxing<br />commentary on HBO.<br />But Foreman has really turned his life around, and he shows you<br />how you can do the same . . . though much of the advice is basic,<br />and you may have heard it before, his effective use of examples<br />helps to drive many of his key points home . . . as he notes in<br />the Introduction, \\"Everyone in life goes through a hard time<br />sometime, but you can't let that define who you are. What defines<br />you is how you come back from those troubles and what you find<br />in life to smile about.\\"<br />There were several other memorable passages; among them:<br />With life there is pain and still more pain, but even with it all,<br />there is always a reason to smile: a beat of music to make you<br />lift your feet and dance; a piece of chocolate to sweeten up<br />a moment. With death, as far as we know, there is no pain,<br />only silence.<br />The point is I could forgive a horse for biting me, another for<br />almost killing me. But it seems that people can rub us the<br />wrong way and we're through with them overnight. We can<br />forgive an animal and hold on to a grudge for years against<br />another person.<br />People only want to hear the best about their children. That's<br />because every mom and dad feels their child is an extension<br />of themselves. So pointing out their kid's shortcomings-whether<br />they're physical, emotional, or behavioral-hurts because it<br />feels like it's a reflection on them and their success as a parent.<br />As soon as you say something's wrong with that boy or girl, their<br />mother or father starts a conversation inside their head that goes<br />something like, \\"If only I were better at this or if only I had done<br />that, my child wouldn't have this problem.\\" It doesn't really matter<br />what you say or that you meant well; what they hear is, \\"What's<br />the matter with you?

Heard the taped version of THE MYTH OF MARKET SHARE by<br />Richard Miniter, which presents an interesting concept that says that<br />being the biggest player in a market doesn't mean that you will make the<br />most profits . . . in fact, the opposite is often true; i.e., the<br />bottom line is that size does NOT automatically lead to profits.<br />According to Miniter, there are three types of companies in every line of<br />business: the profit leaders, which make the most money; the market<br />leaders, which have the largest share of the market; and everyone else.<br />And the goal, at least as it seems to me, should be to become the<br />profit leader. Such a company doesn't go in for the dangerous<br />discounts that sap the strength of its brands in pursuing market share.<br />It avoids foolish mergers for the sake of size. And it focuses on the<br />customer, rather than on the competition.<br />The above might seem easier said than done, but real-life examples<br />(Mobil, Roche Diagnostics, Dell, etc.) so how this can be accomplished.<br />As a result, I liked the book and would recommend it, if just for the<br />conclusion which drives home this key marketing point:<br />In contrast, companies that are profit leaders can usually survive and<br />gain a larger share of the market--as long as they continue to focus<br />on giving the customers precisely what they want, at a profit.	2003-06-10

For example, every week I hand off projects that<br />I think would be fun to do myself. I practice the 10-80-10 principle<br />with the people to whom I'm delegating a task. I help with the<br />first 10 percent by casting vision, laying down parameters, providing<br />resources, and giving encouragement. Then once they've done the<br />middle 80 percent, I come alongside them again and help them take<br />whatever it is the rest of the way, if I can. I call it putting the cherry<br />on top.<br />* Creating additional thoughts is like taking a trip in your car. You may<br />know where you are going, but only as you move toward your<br />destination can you see and experience things in a way not possible<br />before you started. Creative thinking works something like this:<br />Think - Collect - Create - Correct - Connect<br />Once you begin to think, you are free to collect. You ask yourself,<br />What material relates to this thought? Once you have the material,<br />you ask, What ideas can make the thought better? That can start<br />to take an idea to the next level. After that, you can correct or<br />refine it by asking, What changes can make these ideas better? Finally,<br />you connect the ideas by positioning them in the right context to<br />make the thought complete and powerful. The whole process happens<br />more readily when you have a framework or picture of where you<br />want to go. That frees you to add value to your thinking. If you go<br />to the ideas, soon the ideas will flow to you.<br />* If possibility thinking is new to you, you're going to have to give yourself<br />a lot of coaching to eliminate some of the negative self-talk you may hear<br />in your head. When you automatically start listing all the things that can<br />go wrong or all the reasons something can't be done, stop yourself and<br />say, &quot;Don't go there.&quot; Then ask, &quot;What's right about this?&quot; That will help<br />to get you started.

Chastant to his parents from the Vietnam War)<br />Mom, I appreciate all the letters. I appreciate your concern that some<br />of the things you write about are trivial, but they aren't trivial to me.<br />I'm eager to read anything about what you are doing or the family is<br />doing. You can't understand the importance these \\"trivial\\" events take<br />on out here. It helps me keep civilized. For a while, as I read your<br />letters, I am a normal person. I'm not killing people, or worried about<br />being killed. While I read your letters, I'm not carrying guns and grenades.<br />Instead I am going ice skating with David or walking through a depart-<br />ment store to exchange a lamp shade. It is great to know your family's<br />safe, living in a secure country; a country made secure by thousands<br />upon thousands of men who have dies for that country.<br />(Fireman 1st class Keith Lynch to his family in World War II)<br />To think that a thirty-pound bomb the size of a basketball, exploding a<br />thousand feet in the air, could cause such a holocaust was simply<br />unbelievable. I shudder to think what these people underwent when<br />the blast occurred. A blast that literally dissolved their homes, family,<br />friends and any other material thing in the vicinity. A blast that pushed<br />over huge steel structures a mile and a half away as if they were made<br />of blocks. Now I can see what they mean when they say Dead City. A<br />city with no buildings, no trees, no facilities, and no people. All you see<br />from the top of the hill is a ground covered with bricks, burned wood,<br />twisted and pushed over steel frames of buildings for several miles in<br />each direction. There is nothing for the people of this Dead City to do<br />but walk around and think, \\"What manner of people would do such a<br />thing to us, who are a peaceful, courteous and civilized people?\\" I<br />wondered what they thought when they looked at us as we were<br />driving along. \\"Are these the barbarians who did such a thing to us?<br />What can we expect now that we are at their mercy?\\" I only wish they<br />could be made to suffer a tenth of the atrocities that they performed on<br />our men whom they held prisoner. People can say these people are<br />simple, ignorant of the facts, or under a spell, but a nation cannot wage<br />war as they have without the backing of the majority of their people.<br />(Major Sullivan Ballou to his wife in the Civil War)<br />The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come<br />creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I<br />have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and<br />burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might<br />still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to<br />honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims<br />upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me-perhaps it is<br />the wafted prayer of my little Edgar-that I shall return to my loved ones<br />unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love<br />you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will<br />whisper your name.ispers to me-perhaps it is<BR>the wafted prayer of my little Edgar-that I shall return to my loved ones<BR>unharmed.

I am, so I found it quite interesting . . . but others will be bored.<br />Yet all should probably find the following passage of interest, in which six common marketing fallacies are presented:<br />First, consumers think in well-reasoned, linear ways as they<br />evaluate products. They don't. For example, consumers do not<br />consciously assess a car's benefits attribute by attribute<br />and decide whether to buy it. Instead, their emotions--the desire for happiness, prestige, and so on--play a bigger role than logic in the purchase decision.<br />Second, consumers can plausibly explain their thinking and<br />behavior. In reality, however, 95 percent of thinking takes<br />place in our subconscious minds. People use conscious<br />thought primarily as a way to rationalize behavior.<br />Third, consumers' minds, brains, bodies, and surrounding<br />culture can be studied independently of one another. In fact,<br />the mind, brain and external world interact with, and help<br />shape, one another. For example, people from different<br />cultures experience physical pain differently.<br />Fourth, consumers' memories accurately reflect their<br />experience. Research reveals that memory is not perfect,<br />and in fact it changes depending on the situation. For<br />example, when people are asked to recall an experience,<br />their memories are influenced by the sequence in which<br />the questions are asked, and even the color of the paper<br />on which the survey is printed.<br />Fifth, consumers think primarily in words. Yet brain scans<br />suggest that only a small portion of the brain's neural<br />activity ultimately surfaces in language.<br />Sixth, consumers can received &quot;injections&quot; of company<br />messages--and interpret them correctly. However, consumers<br />do not passively absorb messages. They constantly reinterpret<br />such messages in terms of the unique experiences. For instances,<br />people have long heard that they should visit the dentist every<br />six months. But research shows that most individuals are very<br />skeptical about the need for such dental visits.changes depending on the situation.

Grisham<br />seemed to pull together the whole story a bit too abruptly . . . yet that said, I'd still recommend it.<br />There were several memorable passages; among them:<br />* Clay laid the receiver down for a moment and summarized his<br />defense. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client shot Mr.<br />Pumphrey (who was unarmed) five or six times at point-blank<br />range in a dirty alley with a stolen gun for two reasons; first, he recognized him, and second, they had a playground shoving match about eight years ago. May not sound like much, ladies and gentlemen, but all of us know that in Washington, DC, those two reasons are as good as any.<br />* The gaze from the frosty hostess told him, I know you are not a member, but I'll take you to your table anyway. \\"Follow me,\\" she said the slight makings of a fake smile. Clay said nothing. He swallowed hard, looked straight ahead, and tried to ignore the heavy knot in his stomach. How was he supposed to enjoy a meal in such surroundings? He and Rebecca had eaten there twice--once with Mr. and Mrs. Van Horn, once without. The food was expensive and quite good, but then Clay lived on processed turkey so his standards were low and he knew it.<br />* \\"Where will you be in ten years?\\"<br />\\"I don't think like that.

Ever since that time, differentiation has been a basic part of how I manage. That standard raise I got over four decades ago has probably driven my behavior to an extreme. But differentiation is all about being extreme, rewarding the best and weeding out the ineffective. Rigorous differentiation delivers real stars-and stars build great businesses.<br />If I learned anything about making this easier, it's seeing to it that no one should ever be surprised when they are asked to leave. By the time I met with managers I was about to replace, I would have had at least two or three conversations to express my disappointment and to give them the chance to turn things around. I would follow up every business review with a handwritten note.<br />&quot;Let's wallow in this&quot; was a phrase I often used. It meant getting people together, often spontaneously, to wrestle through a complex issue. The sole ticket for admission was know-how, not titles or positions. We wallowed in public relations problems, environmental issues, Boca agendas, and big M&amp;A deals.

Robert J. Kriegel is rapidly becoming one of my favorite<br />business authors . . . I've previously enjoyed two of<br />his other books, HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS<br />WITHOUT WORKING SO HARD and IF IT AIN'T BROKE,<br />BREAK IT . . . so I figured it was time to get hold of<br />one of his earlier efforts, SACRED COWS MAKE THE BEST<br />BURGERS--written with David Brandt.<br />I was definitely not disappointed!<br />Kriegel and Brandt examine why people cling to outmoded<br />beliefs, practices and processes as if their lives depended<br />on them . . . but more importantly, they present ways to<br />inspire a desire to bring in the new.<br />I particularly liked the use of real-life examples . . . although the book was written in 1996, it is still amazingly current; i.e., most of the ideas the authors present still make sense today . . . also, they can be applied to virtually any size or type of organization.<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />* But you'll actually do more and better by learning to slow down when everything around you is speeding up. John Wooden, the great UCLA basketball coach who won an unprecedented 10 national championships, offers this advice: \\"Be quick, but don't hurry. If you hurry you make mistakes.\\"<br />* You may not be a beginner, but you can learn how to think like one. Take real estate agent Michael Young, for instance. He was his company's most successful agent in northern California but he couldn't make the leap from<br />selling houses in [one price range] range to those[in a higher price range]and up.<br />\\"I don't get it, \\" he said. \\"I'm using the same prospecting strategies, making calls in the evening to people at home, giving them advice and telling them about the market, and I'm in the same marketplace. But it's not working.\\"<br />\\"Think like a beginner, forget your old strategies, start fresh,\\" we advised him. \\"Look at the business like you're a novice. What can you do to break into this market?\\"<br />Instead of competing with other brokers, Young spotted an untapped opportunity in the high-end market. He discovered that many listings expire before the house is sold. So he developed a strategy for buying old listings and sharing commissions. The technique brought in so much business that he formed the Michael Young Company in San Francisco. Now brokers<br />call him unsolicited.<br />Want to know something? We're all in the same position as Young. You may think your market is the same as it was last year. But it's not. Everything is changing: people's life and work styles, their jobs, their expectations, their attitudes, their family situations-everything. And technological<br />advances have only accelerated the situation.<br />With business in a perpetual state of flux, we need to keep reinventing our game plan every six months. To do that we have to look at things through fresh eyes.<br />* [Sam] Walton had 10 rules of success, most of which revolve around giving great service, top-quality products, and treating you people right. But it's his 10th rule that sets him apart from his competitors. Walton called it the most important one: Break the rules.<br />If all of your competitors are doing it one way, Mr. Sam used to say, \\"do it exactly the opposite,\\" and that's where you'll get the edge.ting with other brokers, Young spotted an untapped opportunity in the high-end market.

You'll get a lot of useful advice from HOW TO GIVE A DAMN GOOD<br />SPEECH by Philip R. Theibert, a professional speech writer . . . and regardless of your level of experience in this field, you'll find something that will be of value here.<br />There's excellent material on how to organize and write a speech, followed by 100 important things you need to know about giving an effective speech . . . I also liked the author's collection of &quot;best&quot; quotations, along with his compilation of 365 ideas relating to historical dates and events that can be weaved into your speech . . . best of all: he shows you how!<br />Here's just some of the material that caught my attention:<br />A baseball legend's rules for a long life<br />Satchel Paige, a famous baseball pitcher of indeterminate age, once offered his rules for a long life:<br />* Avoid fried meats, which angry up the blood.<br />* If your stomach disputes you, lie down and pacify it with cool thoughts.<br />* Keep the juices flowing by jangling around gently as you move.<br />* Go very light on the vices, such as carrying on in society. The social rumble ain't restful.<br />* Avoid running at all times.<br />* Don't look back. Something might be gaining on you.<br />I'd like to add another rule onto that list. And that one is: Avoid speaking to a group for more than 10 minutes. A long talk might anger up the audience's blood. So today, let me--very briefly--talk about . . .<br />Use Elvis . . . he always gets a laugh<br />Well, I know you have to be very cautious about making predictions. Especially when you predict where things are going to be five years from now. For example, in 1973, there were 457 Elvis impersonators in America. In 1993, there were 2,736 Elvis impersonators in America. If this trend continues, by the year 2000 one out of four Americans will be an Elvis impersonator.<br />Tip O'Neill, US Congressman and former speaker of the House of<br />Representatives, enjoyed telling the story of the only election he ever lost. As a very young man, he ran for the city council in his hometown of Cambridge, Massachusetts. After his defeat, the elderly lady who lived next door said she had voted for him even though he had never bothered to ask for her vote. O'Neill was surprised. He pointed out that he had shoveled her snow every winter. Cut her grass every summer. Couldn't he just assume that he had her vote? But the woman just looked at him and said: &quot;Tip, people like to be asked.&quot;ost. As a very young man, he ran for the city council in his hometown of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

He's not interested in two or three or five or ten things. He's interested in a million. He sees things differently<br />from everybody else. He just sees injustices, unfairness, and improper ways of handling situations that everyone else just accepts. He has a cosmic view of these things, very broad, but at the same time, he is a person who pays enormous attention to details. I never met anybody who can think so big and think so small at the same time.&quot;<br />* As a boss, Nader remained an original. He once claimed that his number-one criterion for hiring people was that they be thick-skinned. &quot;People often ask me how I choose the people to work with me,&quot; he explained. &quot;Well, you start off by saying they have to be bright, hard-working, the usual traits. But the one key probably is how willing they are not to be loved.&quot;<br />* Nader asked [Bobby] Fischer his secret. Fischer explained that there was calculation in many of his decisions, whether showing up late to matches, canceling interviews, even refusing an invitation to visit the White House. It made him seem like a<br />temperamental genius, even more than he actually was, and the<br />public ate it up. &quot;If you want to get attention to the game, you have to manipulate the press,&quot; Fischer explained.<br />For Nader, this was confirmation of his own instincts. His aim was to draw attention to the cause of consumerism. During this era, he was a marionette master when it came to the press.

Sometimes I poked at them, and imaged Hanna doing<br />what she was accused of doing as clearly as I could, and also<br />doing what the hair on her neck and the birthmark on her shoulder recalled to my mind. It was like a hand pinching an arm numbed by an injection. The arm doesn't register that it is being pinched by the hand, the hand registers that it is pinching the arm, and at first the mind cannot tell the two of them apart. But a moment later it distinguishes them quite clearly. Perhaps the hand has pinched so hard that the flesh stays white for a while. Then the blood flows back and the spot regains its color. But that does not bring back sensation.<br />I tried to talk about the problem with friends. Imagine someone is racing intentionally towards his own destruction and you can save him-do you go ahead and save him? Imagine there's an operation, and the patient is a drug user and the drugs are incompatible with the anesthetic, but the patient is ashamed of being an addict and does not want to tell the anesthesiologist-do you talk to the anesthesiologist? Imagine a trial and a defendant who will be convicted if he doesn't admit to being left-handed-do you tell the judge what's going on? Imagine he's gay, and could not have committed the crime because he's gay, but is ashamed of being gay. It isn't a question of whether the defendant should be ashamed of being left-handed or gay-just imagine that he is.<br />I tried to approach my later relationships better, and to get into them more deeply. I admitted to myself that a woman had to move and feel a bit like Hanna, smell and taste a bit like her for things to be good between us. I told them about Hanna. And I told them more about myself than I had told Gertrud; they had to be able to make sense of whatever they might find disconcerting in my behavior and moods. But the women didn't want to hear that much. I remember Helen, and American literary critic who stroked my back silently and soothingly as I talked, and continued to stroke me just as silently and soothingly after I'd stopped speaking.

If Richard Carlson writes something, I'm going to make it a<br />point to read it . . . I loved DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF<br />and his many books that followed (DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL<br />STUFF AT WORK, DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF FOR<br />MEN, etc.) . . . his words are simple, yet they make sense . . . and they seem to be written directly to you, as if he were speaking to you on a one-on-one basis.<br />His latest, WHAT ABOUT THE BIG STUFF? does just what it promises in the subtitle; i.e., helps you find strength and move forward when the stakes are high . . . the book tackles a range of difficult issues--from illness, death, injury, and<br />aging to alcoholism, divorce and financial pressures--but<br />does so in a manner that is not preachy . . . I actually felt<br />better after reading Carlson's suggestions on handling<br />these various situations in a proactive fashion.<br />In addition, I liked he got me thinking about how I<br />would handle things that might come my way . . . or<br />that might be encountered by friends and/or relatives . . . while he doesn't propose glib comebacks, he does give you<br />many useful ideas as to responses that might lend comfort<br />to those in need of it.<br />In reviewing my notes, I'm finding it difficult to choose<br />just a few parts to share, which is always a good<br />sign . . . but here goes anyway:<br />I was sitting with a friend at lunch about ten days after the<br />terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. With<br />tears in her eyes, she said, \\"Did you notice that not a single person on any of the hijacked planes who had the opportunity to make a phone call called their stockbroker?\\" Far from being facetious, she was making an obvious but very important point. When the stakes are high, only one thing matters: love. No one is concerned about their weight or the way they look. They aren't upset that life isn't perfect. they aren't fretting about high taxes, the liberals or conservatives, previous conflicts, disputes with neighbors, or a lack of parking. They don't care about the rates of return on their investment portfolio. They aren't focused on any of their grievances.<br />Indeed, the only thing that matters, when it really matters, is love. The question is, \\"Why do we treat life as if it doesn't really matter right now?\\"<br />On the flip side, we're more careful to evaluate each situation before saying yes. When asked if you can do something, you should ask yourself two questions. First, \\"Is this something I have to do?\\" And second, \\"Is this something I want to do?\\" I you don't answer yes to at least one of these questions, you'll probably learn to say no more often. In the process, you'll begin to create more time for those things that really matter. After all, what's \\"bigger\\" than time itself?<br />One of my favorite descriptions of life is that it's just \\"one mistake after another with a little time in between.\\" Despite its humor, this is a pretty accurate way of seeing things. If you think about it, its true. We make mistakes, we (hopefully) learn from them; we make adjustments and move on. At some point, there will be another mistake, and so forth. In the meantime, everyone else is going through the same process. Your parents are making mistakes, as are your friends, neighbors, children, coworkers, and everyone else.s with neighbors, or a lack of parking.

Heard the taped version of WHAT IF?: THE WORLD'S FOREMOST<br />MILITARY HISTORIANS IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN, edited<br />by Robert Cowley . . . I often speculate about lots of things, and so do the contributors to this book--including Stephen E. Ambrose, John Keegan, David McCollough, and James M. McPherson (to name just a few).<br />For example, what if:<br />George Washington had never made his miraculous escape<br />from the British on Long Island in the early dawn of August 29, 1776?<br />a Confederate aide hadn't accidentally lost General Robert E. Lee's plans for invading the North?<br />the Allied invasion on D Day had failed?<br />These and a whole host of other questions are considered . . . the resultant answers are often fun, but at the same time, sometimes frightening . . . as in, Hitler's case . . . had he not attacked Russia when he did, he might have moved into the Middle East and secured the oil supplies the Third Reich so badly needed, thus helping it retain its power in Europe . . . can you just imagine the present-day implications for that scenario?<br />If you're a history buff, this is a MUST read . . . but methinks<br />that others will enjoy it and become much more interested<br />in the subject as a result . . .

If you can anticipate other people's moves and<br />also plan out your own moves, you'll be steps ahead of your<br />audience and able to astound them with regularity. A little mis-<br />direction always helps too. Misdirection is a skill that magicians use to make their audience look where they want them to, when they want them to. I remember when I was young and playing chess with adults, if I made a really good move, I'd often pretend that I was angry with myself for committing such a &quot;blunder.&quot; Because I seemed aggravated, I'd throw my opponents off, they'd overlook my possibilities, and bam, next move I'd take their queen. This is a form of time misdirection, relaxing your opponent's attention and therefore controlling it.<br />In the 1980s and 1990s, an amazing psychic named Herb Dewey<br />wrote a series of books aimed at an audience of fellow psychics, although many mentalists in the magic field bought them. They were filled with practical tips for doing cold readings that Dewey has amassed during his long career, which included over 100,000 personal readings. Dewey's techniques were genius. He would start a cold reading by asking his client, &quot;How long are you here for?&quot; If his client was visiting form out of town, he or she was immediately impressed and predisposed to read into anything he would say from that point on.

Bryon . . . it certainly does not make her come across as somebody I would want to have<br />as my friend, but nor would I want to be one of the many on her<br />bad side.<br />What I liked about the book, however, was that it just wasn't a<br />hatchet job . . . Bryon does an excellent job of digging into<br />why and how Stewart became such a success . . . whether<br />you're a fan or detractor, you will certainly find the material<br />extremely readable.<br />In addition, you'll get one of the best primers I have ever<br />encountered on the art of self-promotion!<br />There were several memorable sections; among them:<br />Twenty years later, this was translated by Martha into the<br />expectation that Turkey Hill visitors and weekend houseguests would lend a hand with the innumerable projects that were always underway. Such a guest arrived one afternoon and was directed by Martha to weed a flower bed. \\"Are you serious?\\" asked the visitor incredulously and promptly got in her car and left, never to return.<br />It was brilliant; in fact, it was a stroke of genius. And from the moment he realized what she had in mind, that is exactly how he began thinking of her as well--as Martha Stewart the genius. It was so simple and so obvious . . . and so smart. She intended to syndicate a half-hour commercial disguised as an actual program, and she was going to cut its cost of production by sticking commercials from her own advertisers right in the show. It was awesome! A commercial inside and infomercial. It was even better than that, for the infomercial would be promoting Martha . . . who would be cross-promoting the<br />magazine . . . that would be carrying the ads . . . of the companies that would be advertising on the show! An arrangement like that could spiral right into outer space.<br />He turned to Martha. \\"I'm not sure I can sell this,\\" he said. \\"I mean, maybe we can sell it, but I'm not sure we'll get renewals.\\" A sense of desperation was creeping into his words as he said, \\"Martha, I mean look, the people in the cities where we have to sell this show are in urban environments. They're working-class people. These people don't even have gardens.\\" Martha looked back at him.

YOU MEAN<br />NOW? . . . the book, written with Dave Kaplan, is subtitled<br />ADVICE FOR LIFE FROM THE ZENNEST MASTER OF THEM<br />ALL . . . it contains 26 chapters, one for each letter from A<br />to Z, that has me believing that Berra was not only a great<br />baseball player--he's also quite a guy.<br />Although I have my doubts as to what he wrote vs. what<br />Kaplan did, I nevertheless enjoyed the thoughts on such<br />varied topics as family, competition and living in New York City.<br />Naturally, I also chuckled at a bunch of quotes that have<br />been attributed to Berra--although he admits that he did not<br />say them all . . . among them:<br />Little League is good because it keeps parents off the<br />streets and the kids out of the house.<br />It's so crowded nobody goes there.<br />If you ask me questions I don't know, I'm not going to answer.<br />You saw DR. ZHIVARGO? Why? Aren't you feeling well?<br />There were several other parts of the book that I liked; most notably:<br />I'm Lucky that Carm is a very upbeat, positive person and doesn't dwell on this stuff either. One time, though she did ask me where I should be buried. Our families are from St. Louis, where I grew up; my career was in New York; we live in New Jersey. I told Carm, &quot;I don't know, just surprise me.&quot;<br />If I'm buying a car, I'll leave my wallet home the first time and just ask questions. What are the payments? What kind of warranty? What's the downside of the car? The right questions can help you make the right decisions.<br />It's no big secret-winning makes you feel better about everything, and losing doesn't. Everybody wants to win, who doesn't? Winning is important, that's why you keep score, but I think maybe overall it's gotten too much so, especially in kids' sports where there's too much stress on winning and not enough fun. I guess that's what's happened as sports have gotten so big in our country. Instead of asking their kids after a soccer or a Little League game, &quot;Did you win?&quot;<br />maybe the parents should ask, &quot;Did you give it your best?&quot; or<br />&quot;Did you have fun?&quot;r a soccer or a Little League game, &quot;Did you win?&quot;<BR>maybe the parents should ask, &quot;Did you give it your best?&quot; or<BR>&quot;Did you have fun?&quot;	2003-01-07

She stared unhappily at her living room, which might<br />as well have borne a sign: Single Girl, Lone, Late 90s. A trail of his-and-hers clothing lay on the floor beside five-pound bright yellow dumbbells propped up next to a Tae Bo tape that was still in its original shrink-wrap. The treadmill she'd bought to fulfill a get-in-shape New Year's Resolution three New Years ago was draped with her dry cleaning. There was a half-empty Passionberry Punch wine cooler on the coffee table, four shoe boxes from Saks piled by the closet, and a half-dozen romance novels beside her bed. Disaster, Rose thought, wondering what she could do before dawn to give her apartment the appearance of being inhibited by someone with an interesting life. Was there an all-night emporium that sold throw pillows and bookcases? And was it too late to do something about her legs?<br />There were bottles of painkillers, boxes of antacids, a jumbo-sized box of Pepto-Bismol, a family-sized box of Band-Aid bandages, and a Red Cross-approved first-aid kit. There was Midol and Advil and Nuprin, NyQuil and DayQuil, cough syrup and cold tablets and tampons. Here was a girl who made good use of the coupons at CVS, Maggie thought, as she sorted through Ace bandages and multivitamins, calcium tablets and dental floss, rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide, prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide and four unopened toothbrushes. Where was the<br />eyeliner? Where were the blush and the concealer that her<br />sister so desperately needed? Maggie hadn't found anything<br />cosmetic except for a single half-used lipstick. There was<br />makeup remover--a tub of Pond's cold cream--but no makeup.<br />What did Rose think? That somebody was going to sneak<br />into her apartment in the dead of night, tie her up, put<br />makeup on her face, and then leave?<br />Rose smiled a tiny smile. Amy had honed her philosophy of<br />failed relationships, and how to behave in their wake, over years of bad boyfriends. Step one: Mourn for a month (two weeks if the relationship hadn't involved sex). Step two: If you'd been dumped or cheated on, permit yourself one scandalous act of revenge (her last boyfriend, a hard-core vegan, had doubtlessly been shocked and horrified to find himself enrolled in the Organ Meat of the Month Club). Step three: Get over it. No regrets, no moping, no late-night drive-bys or dialing while drunk.

I found myself taking<br />countless notes, always a sign that what I'm reading is<br />really making quite a dent on me.<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />* Because there is a reason why Veeck went<br />to bed in the middle of the night. And a reason<br />why he woke up four hours later. And a reason<br />why he was never dulled by routine, why every<br />day became an opportunity, and every hour,<br />every moment of his 71 years, was gilded and<br />precious.<br />He did not sleep because he could not sleep.<br />He was afraid to sleep because sleeping<br />meant missing something. He was so caught<br />up in the basest virtues of each day that his<br />mind couldn't let go.<br />Said Washington writer Tom Boswell after<br />Veeck's passed away in 1986, \\"Cause of<br />death: Life.\\"<br />\\"With the amount of sleep he didn't get,\\" says<br />longtime Chicago White Sox organist Nancy<br />Faust, \\"Bill probably died at 85 instead of 71.\\"<br />* Veeck once sent away for a mail-order toy.

When he sent his check to the manufacturer,<br />he tore it into tiny pieces, put them into an envelope<br />and wrote: \\"I put your toy together. You put my<br />check together.\\"<br />No doubt he felt a burden lifted.<br />The manufacturer had no choice but to accept the<br />check.<br />* He called amputees in the hospital to console them.<br />(\\"Look at it this way,\\" he would say. \\"One pair of socks<br />will last you twice as long. And in the winter, only one<br />foot will get cold.\\") He told one fan whose leg was wrapped<br />in a heavy brace, \\"If I had another leg to give you, I would.\\"<br />He demonstrated the leg to curious children. He consoled<br />an amateur softball player who had broken his leg,<br />slipping the wooden leg off and telling him, \\"Here. Use mine.\\"<br />\\"I only fear two things,\\" he'd say, brandishing the leg. \\"Fire<br />and termites.\\"<br />And though I typically like to include only three passages,<br />I just had to include this one too:<br />* Soon after the funeral, Mary Frances was digging<br />through the house when she discovered a note. They'd<br />always written to each other for more than three decades;<br />notes of love and sentimentality and humor. Seems he'd<br />written this one while waiting to be taken to the hospital<br />for the last time.<br />On one side he'd expressed the depth of his love for<br />Mary Frances.

Seems he'd<BR>written this one while waiting to be taken to the hospital<BR>for the last time.<br />On one side he'd expressed the depth of his love for<BR>Mary Frances.

I do recommend it . . . strongly.<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />* Occasionally I hear from people with spinal<br />cord injuries who have been sitting in a wheel-<br />chair for as much as twenty-one years. Some<br />tell me that there is no point in searching for a<br />cure; others even say they are happy with life<br />the way it is and don't want to be cured. It's<br />difficult for me to understand their point of<br />view, but I completely respect those individuals<br />as long as they don't try to interfere with<br />progress. Less than a generation ago it would<br />have been almost irrelevant to ask a patient<br />with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, muscular<br />dystrophy, ALS, or a spinal cord injury not to<br />stand in the way of progress, simply because<br />there wasn't much. Today all that has changed.<br />Since the time of my injury, scientists all over<br />the world have been steadily moving forward,<br />although they are not progressing as rapidly<br />as many patients would like. At least they have<br />been saying publicly, and most of us believe<br />privately, that it is no longer appropriate or<br />necessary to use the word \\"impossible.\\"<br />* I remember thoroughly embarrassing another<br />nurse her first day on the job. I had been treated<br />for a skin breakdown in the sacral area, which had<br />plagued me for months but finally healed. Lying on<br />my left side I asked her, \\"How's my butt?\\" She replied,<br />\\"It looks great to me.\\" I said, \\"I know that. But what<br />about my skin?\\" She turned crimson. For a moment<br />I thought I'd lost her, but thankfully she came back<br />for her next shift, and after all these years she's still<br />here checking out my butt on a daily basis.<br />* We spent most of the time talking. I quickly realized<br />that we'd never really done that before. When Matthew<br />and Al flew over from England to be with Dana and<br />me for at least a part of every vacation, I usually picked<br />them up at the airport in Boston. Then it was a three<br />hour drive across Massachusetts to our home in the<br />Berkshires. I remember listening to the radio together<br />on one of those trips when they were about nine and<br />five. We tuned in to a variety of stations that played<br />classical music, rock 'n' roll, contemporary top forty<br />and oldies. I asked them to identify the meter: Was the<br />piece in 1 / 2, 3 / 4, 4 / 4, 6 / 8, or something else?<br />How would they describe the tempo of the classical<br />pieces: adagio, andante, allegro, or something else?<br />In the rock 'n' roll and contemporary pop selections<br />could they distinguish between the main melody and<br />the bridge, also known as the middle eight? Somewhere<br />along the mass Pike, Al piped up in her chirpy English<br />accent. \\"Do you know, Daddy,\\" she said, \\"this is the first<br />time in such a long time that we've had a real conversation<br />about something?\\" I realized that she was right. Not that<br />we didn't talk, but usually it was while doing something<br />else. Now I gave them my full attention, and I soon learned<br />to listen more than talk. That began a process of discovering<br />that, in bringing up children and relating to others, some-<br />times being is more important thedoing. I was also to<br />learn that even if you can't move, you can have a powerful<br />effect with what you say.<br />One special day in Will's life is a good example. When he<br />was six, he was still afraid to ride by himself without the<br />training wheels on his bike. Dana spent hours killing her<br />back as she bent over to hold his seat as he pedaled<br />around timidly in front of our garage. I decided to see if<br />I could help. I told him to start with his left foot on the<br />ground and to set the right pedal in the fully raised<br />position. I told him to grab the handlebars, push hard<br />on the right pedal, and then put his left foot on the other<br />pedal and keep going, being careful not to over-steer. I<br />said if he kept his hand steady the bike wouldn't wobble<br />so much. He listened carefully and got into the ready<br />position. Then he froze, afraid to make that first push.<br />I told him to take his time, but added that I was prepared<br />to sit in the driveway all afternoon until he did it. I<br />reminded him that I would never ask him to do anything<br />too scary of too difficult. He didn't complain; he just sat<br />there for quite a long time assessing the situation. Then<br />I announced that on the count of three he should start.<br />I made it a long count, but after three I said, \\"Go,\\" and<br />he did it. He pushed down, the bike moved forward,<br />he got his other foot on the pedal, and off he went. On<br />his first run he made a complete circle around the<br />driveway. As he came past my chair the first time, his<br />face was a study in fierce concentration. The second<br />time he came by, he was smiling. For the next fifteen<br />minutes he kept riding around our circular drive, gradually<br />picking up speed. After that he wanted to go down the<br />steep hill toward our mailbox, but we saved that for<br />another day.ay.<br />One special day in Will's life is a good example.

ATKINS' AGE-DEFYING DIET REVOLUTION,<br />written by Dr. Robert C. Atkins . . . he is the somewhat<br />controversial doctor who people seem to either love or<br />hate--but whose methods work . . . in fact, a friend<br />recently told me how she lost 60 pounds by following<br />his advice!<br />I'm not interested in losing any weight, but I am trying<br />to reduce my cholesterol . . . and I wanted to<br />find out how Atkins said this could be done, while<br />eating a diet high in fats . . . also, like all of us, I'd like<br />to live longer and feel better.<br />Atkins cogently points out that:<br />* Whatever causes today's heart disease epidemic was not<br />there eighty or more years ago. Heart attacks are a modern<br />phenomenon that occurs in Western cultures.<br />* Cleave's Rule of Twenty Years warns that whenever refined<br />carbohydrates become a major addition to a culture, two<br />diseases begin to emerge twenty years later: diabetes and<br />coronary heart disease.<br />* The rule of blood lipid levels most likely to result in a heart attack is the combination of high triglycerides and low<br />HDL cholesterol.<br />* By restricting carbohydrates, my heart patients almost<br />always report improvement in symptoms and are able to reduce<br />or stop medications for heart disease, high blood pressure,<br />and/or diabetes.<br />In addition, he says trans fats are &quot;the worst&quot; . . . these are<br />polyunsaturated vegetable oils that have been processed to make<br />them solid at room temperature--these fats are known as partially hydrogenated oils. Heated polyunsaturated vegatable oils, as you do when you deep-fry foods in corn, safflower, peanut, and other common oils, is another way to produce trans fat. . . . And of course, margarine, even the low-fat kind, is by definition nothing but a stick or tub of trans fat.<br />Overall, Atkins certainly got me thinking about my diet, and that's a good thing . . . I'm not quite ready to adopt all that he proposes; however, I will make it a point to get more protein in my diet.er, I will make it a point to get more protein in my diet.	2002-12-09

I wanted to see what<br />would happen, but also, I did not want it to end . . . and<br />I guarantee that you'll shed more than a few tears if<br />give this one a chance.<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />Paul watched her walk away, noticing again how attractive<br />she was. In spite of the direction his medical practice<br />had taken in later years, he'd always remained less interested<br />in appearance than those things a person couldn't see:<br />kindness and integrity, humor and sensibility. Adrienne, he<br />as sure, had all those traits, but he got the felling that they'd been unappreciated for a long time, maybe even by her.<br />\\"It was something he would always say to me, ever since<br />I was a little girl. No matter how good or bad I'd done in<br />anything, no matter if I was happy or sad, my dad would<br />always give me a hug and tell me, 'I'm proud of you.' \\"<br />But Paul was different. Paul, she knew, wasn't like Jack<br />in any way, and it was there, while upstairs in his room,<br />that Adrienne first felt a vague sense of anxious<br />anticipation, something akin to what a high roller might<br />feel when hoping for a lucky roll of the dice.	2002-12-02

Books	5	14	15	N	N	Great book for anybody interested in marketing and/or sports	Loved reading MARKETING OUTRAGEOUSLY by Joe Spoelstra, one of America's top sports marketers . . . he uses many real--and often funny--examples to show how it is possible to get a company known without going into bankruptcy.<br />Even if you're not a sports fan, there is much here that<br />can be applied to almost any marketing situation.<br />What I so much liked about this book is that Spoelstra<br />has been involved in what he writes about . . . he has<br />consulted with major sports organizations including baseball,<br />hockey, soccer, and basketball in the United States, Spain<br />and Japan.<br />Also, he was general manager of the Portland Trail Blazers for<br />11 years, during which time he was the focus of what was perhaps the strangest trade in sports history. Portland was in need of a guard to fill a hole created by injury. The guard the Blazers wanted was the starting point guard for Indiana Pacers. A deal was struck; the compensation to the Pacers wasn't a player, but one week of Spoelstra's time. He then played a key role in the restructuring of the Pacers' front office.<br />Later, as president of the New Jersey Nets for three years, he<br />increased that team's revenue by almost 500 percent.<br />There were several memorable passages; among them:<br />* Learn to ask this question: \\"What's it going to take?\\"<br />Most business people are thinking, \\"How can we<br />make our budget numbers?\\" or \\"How can we<br />improve our profit over last year?\\" They are<br />asking the wrong question.<br />What if you asked the following question at<br />your company: \\"What's it going to take to be<br />the best company in our industry this year?\\"<br />You don't have to be CEO or a business<br />owner to ask this kind of question. You could<br />ask, \\"What's it going to take to become<br />the best marketing department in the industry<br />this year?\\" or \\"What's it going to take to be<br />the best department in our company this year?\\"<br />I know how difficult it is to answer that question.<br />I've asked it many times.

Sometimes I've asked others,<br />even though if they'd been carrying guns I'd<br />probably to dead.

Fox and suggested that I might like it . . . was he ever right! . . . this was one of the best business books I have read in a long time.<br />The idea behind the book lies in the American Indian tradition of employing a Rainmaker to use magical powers to nourish the crops to feed the people . . . updating this, a Rainmaker today is a person who brings revenue into an organization (be it profit or not-for-profit).<br />Even though this premise might sound so basic, it is amazing<br />how many companies tend to forget it . . . Fox says you<br />mustn't, and he presents a series of simple-to-follow principles<br />that can be applied to a wide variety of situations.<br />There were many memorable passages, but so as to not<br />overwhelm you with all of them, I'll just present the his series of six &quot;killer&quot; sales questions:<br />1. When you have the customer on the phone, suggest a meeting<br />and then ask, &quot;Do you have your appointment calendar handy?&quot;<br />2. The Rainmaker asks the customer, &quot;Will you look at the facts<br />and decide for yourself if they make sense?&quot;<br />3. [when a competitor is mentioned] You answer exactly as<br />follows: &quot;Yes, that is a good company. Would you like to know<br />our points of difference?&quot;<br />4. When a customer asks for a product demonstration, the<br />Rainmaker responds as follows: &quot;We would be happy to give<br />you a demonstration. If the demo is successful, is there<br />anything else prohibiting you from going ahead?&quot;<br />5. To close the sale, to get the final customer commitment, the<br />Rainmaker might say: &quot;You've looked at everything. Your concerns<br />have been answered. Time is of the essence.

Forni, a professor who teaches civility and Italian<br />literature at Johns Hopkins University . . . it is a little but<br />thoughtful book that I strongly recommend to anybody looking to<br />make life both easier and more enjoyable . . . we all find ourselves surrounded by those we perceive as inconsiderate (never us,of course!) . . . but how can we manage to live with such people?<br />Forni presents lots of useful examples, as well as advice,<br />on how to answer that question . . . in addition, he provides<br />25 rules that readers are urged to at least ponder . . . some<br />of them are as follows:<br />Acknowledge others<br />Be inclusive<br />Be agreeable<br />Apologize earnestly and thoughtfully<br />Avoid personal questions,<br />Don't shift responsibility and blame<br />While all these might seem basic, in reality, they<br />are quite a bit trickier to follow . . . but Forni<br />got me thinking about them, and that's a good<br />thing . . . now to actually implement them into<br />my daily existence, well . . . that's something<br />I can at least work toward!<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />Healthy young men from two Harvard classes of the early<br />1950s were asked to fill out a questionnaire that would<br />assess how close they were to their parents. A check of<br />their medical records 35 years later yielded intriguing data.<br />One hundred percent of the men who had reported low levels<br />of closeness to both parents had been diagnosed in the following<br />years with serious diseases such as heart disease and duodenal<br />ulcer. Among those who had reported good, warm relationships with both parents only 47 percent had been similarly diagnosed.<br />A colleague tells me over the telephone that she went to Florida for a vacation. Instead of asking her how her vacation was, I hasten to tell her how I feel about Florida. I quickly add what I like to do when I am there. And finally, I break the fascinating news that I was there two years ago, didn't go last winter, but hope to return the next. The result: my colleague's<br />experience and feelings get lost completely in my inane<br />and self-centered rambling.<br />It's Saturday morning and you are not planning<br />to go out all day.

I especially liked<br />this one line, used by an executive answering his phone:<br />\\"Mike here.

Get them to tell you their secrets,<br />one-on-one. That won't cost your company very much at all.\\"<br />Lastly, I enjoyed learning the following acronym: GAPS . . . it<br />served to summarize the book's key message, which<br />encourages you to:<br />Go for the \\"shoulds.\\"<br />Analyze the \\"is.\\"<br />Pin down the causes.<br />Select the right solutions.	2002-10-28

I kept studying<br />her face. My mother's eyes opened and she stared at my face,<br />filled with anxiety. She smiled softly and squeezed my hand<br />gently. Her eyes, almost black on her white face, seemed to be<br />looking through me. She whispered, &quot;Don't be afraid, it happens<br />to everyone.&quot; She took a deep breath and exhaled. The air came<br />out of her mouth like a slowly deflating balloon. She stopped<br />breathing.<br />The world is filled with people who have suffered from one misfortune or another. The only thing that sets one apart from the rest is the desire and the attempt to help others. People who reach out beyond their pain, out into the world in a trusting way-they are the ones who make a difference. Nietzsche said, &quot;He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.&quot;<br />Why? Because deep down we know that what matters in this life<br />is more than winning for ourselves. What matters in this life<br />is helping others win, even if it means slowing down and changing our course. We all want happiness. Life teaches us that we achieve happiness when we seek the happiness and well-being of others.hen we seek the happiness and well-being of others.	2002-10-21

If you read one business book this year, you won't go wrong with HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT WORKING SO<br />HARD by Robert J. Kriegel . . . it is packed with ideas that will help you stop working so hard--and start working better.<br />Kriegel, author of the equally excellent IF IT AIN'T BROKE . . . BREAK IT, contends that it is not a badge of honor to work 100 hours per week . . . rather, he points out that it's the innovators, visionaries and new-thinkers who love their work who rise to the top.<br />I particularly liked his 90 Percent Rule, which says that a relaxed atmosphere produces better results than a tense one . . . he then described his experiments with over 150 salespeople . . . those who made less calls had at least 20 percent better results, largely because they felt more relaxed and were able to listen better.<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />* In my programs, I always ask, &quot;How many of you get your best<br />ideas--barn burners, lightbulbs, the aha's--while at work?&quot; No one ever raises their hand. &quot;Which room in your house do you get your best ideas in?&quot; I ask, The response is always the bathroom or bedroom. &quot;Why is that?&quot; &quot;Because no on bothers me and I get time to think&quot; is the usual response.<br />* Ray Evernham, with driver Jeff Gordon, used this flip-of-the-rules strategy in NASCAR racing to win the Winston Cup Championship several times. Evernham says, &quot;If conventional wisdom say the corner is the best place to pass, we practice passing on the other end of the track, because nobody is expecting to get passed there.&quot;<br />* Whether it is a book or a proposal, many people have difficulty starting a writing project. That first step seems like an insurmountable hurdle. The first line seems impossible to get right.<br />One way to get yourself going is to begin at the end or the middle. I have started out writing my last three books with those chapters that I am most excited and clear about. I will often begin writing a chapter, not necessarily at what I think should be the beginning, but with a great story or example that I enjoy relating and that clearly illustrates the point I want to make.

I would have liked to have seen some more real examples, particularly based on companies that he had assisted.<br />However, he did use one example that I really liked . . . in talking about Steven Spielberg, he mentioned how Harrsion Ford had once approached him with an idea when filming INDIANA JONES<br />AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM . . . Spielberg was not crazy about<br />what he had heard, but rather than reject it outright, he said: &quot;I like that a lot. But let's just explore one other option.&quot;<br />This technique, according to Kao, provides an opportunity to<br />double and even redouble ideas.

Macy . . . look for it on that channel and/or see if your local video store has it as a rental . . . you won't be disappointed.<br />But in the meantime, get hold of this inspirational book . . . Brady, who first worked for Porter as a teenager and now shares his story with various organizations and corporations, helps you<br />see that each one of us can make a difference . . . and as<br />Bill says, &quot;Never doubt that your life is important.&quot;<br />You'll further become convinced that you can change the<br />world--one door at a time!<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />According to the MERRIAM-WEBSTER DICTIONARY, the word &quot;no&quot;<br />is an act or instance of refusing or denying something. For instance, a customer's refusal to purchase goods or services from a salesperson is generally expressed via the word &quot;no.&quot; For some reason or another, Bill Porter doesn't hear it that way. Bill hears the word &quot;no&quot; differently; he hears it to mean that the customer will be glad for Bill to return at<br />a more convenient time or please to be shown another, more<br />necessary product.<br />After talking with Bill about his dependence on others to complete his dressing, I wondered if under the same circumstances I would have had the courage to ask others to help. I quickly realized that we all need help, we all lack skill of some sort or another. It's just that<br />most of our inabilities aren't so visually evident as Bill's; they may be psychological rather than physical, and, often, we create them ourselves. And, as we all know, some of our self-imposed mental disabilities can be more difficult to overcome than physical ones. All Bill Porter needs is someone to button his cuffs and clip his tie; it's the rest of us who need attitude adjustment, R&amp;R, and pep talks. In my clearest moments, I am able to see Bill Porter as he sees himself and truly say &quot;What disability?&quot;<br />And so with the aid of family, friends, and a few employees, I am better able to appreciate the time I spend with my family, while the joy I get form traveling to share Bill's story lasts until our next adventure. From Bill, I learned to accept the help of others without feeling less of a person.

Hanukkah food! Religious minorities don't count with Gannett. So the reporter had to find someone who was both Jewish and a racial minority. Too bad Sammy Davis Jr. is dead.<br />They love affirmative action, as long as their own kids get into Ivy League schools. They love handing out jobs based on racial preferences, as long as they get to keep theirs. It's a great deal: it's always somebody else who has to make the sacrifice--sometimes Asian-American kids, sometimes other white students who don't get into places like Harvard and Yale and Princeton--while the white liberal elites get to claim credit for being so decent, the saviors of black people in America.<br />While, thanks to the TV news, I know all sorts of things about the aforementioned Joey Buttafuco, I did not know that between<br />1979 and 1988 the suicide rate for girls aged ten to fourteen<br />rose 27 percent. And for boys it went up a frightening<br />71 percent. . . .

Vise,<br />an engrossing true spy thriller about the unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen--the most dangerous double agent in FBI history.<br />I was amazed to learn how Hannsen escaped detection for so<br />long . . . also, I liked how the author unfolded his tale, along with that of FBI Director Louis J. Freeh (the man who set the trap that would expose the traitor within its mist).<br />Spy thrillers are not typically my favorite type of reading, but I'm glad I made an exception for this one . . . the fact thatit was true made it so much more harrowing.<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />Sex, among both numeraries and supernumeraries, is a taboo<br />subject, and discussion of homosexuality in any form is<br />considered dangerous because it can poison the soul. Opus<br />Dei itself is tightlipped about the lives and roles on numeraries. One of the Hanssens' daughters, Sue, is a numerary who, as required by Opus Dei, sleeps on a wooden board every night and without a pillow once a week. (Women are treated more<br />harshly than men in Opus Dei in order to quell their passions,<br />officials say.) When Sue's sister, Jane, got married a number<br />of years ago, Sue turned down her invitation to be a bridesmaid.<br />Opus Dei would not allow Sue to take a man's arm and walk<br />down the aisle in a wedding.<br />At the same time, Bob's head was spinning. He thought he knew<br />how to handle Bonnie. According to a friend of Bob's, \\"He has<br />a little theory that every day you have to tell a woman a certain amount of positive things, and if you do, things will always be good. He called it his 'counter theory.\\" He said in a woman's brain there is a counter and they count up the good things you say to them and the positive strokes you give them.\\" As far as his work was concerned, Bob didn't want Bonnie to know anything. He had to do a better job of concealing things. And to make matters worse, now a priest was involved.<br />Freeh knew that the FBI was at its best in a crisis, and he<br />talked tough from the start. \\"We will search you and find you,\\"<br />he said. \\"There is no place on earth where you will be safe<br />from the most powerful forces of justice.\\" The director made it<br />clear that he and other senior FBI personnel, along with<br />thousands of agents and forensics experts working on the<br />case, were on a mission. Instead of regular shifts, they<br />began putting in as many hours as possible each day until<br />they needed a few hours of rest. It was during times likes these<br />that Freeh, director of an agency with a multibillion-dollar<br />budget and thousands of employees, earned the nickname<br />\\"the presidentially appointed case agent.\\" Rather than planning<br />for the long-term or staying abreast of developing cases and<br />issues, Freeh became completely and totally involved in the<br />details of the Oklahoma City bombing and a handful of other<br />high-profile cases on his watch.Freeh knew that the FBI was at its best in a crisis, and he <BR>talked tough from the start. \\"We will search you and find you,\\"<BR>he said. \\"There is no place on earth where you will be safe<BR>from the most powerful forces of justice.\\" The director made it<BR>clear that he and other senior FBI personnel, along with <BR>thousands of agents and forensics experts working on the<BR>case, were on a mission.

Read another excellent book by Cheryl Richardson, author<br />of TAKE TIME FOR YOUR LIFE and LIFE MAKEOVERS--both<br />of which I enjoyed immensely . . . her latest is STAND UP<br />FOR YOUR LIFE, and the subtitle says it all: DEVELOP THE COURAGE, CONFIDENCE, AND CHARACTER TO FULFILL YOUR GREATEST POTENTIAL.<br />Richardson, a master certified coach, takes you through an<br />interactive training program that will help you transform<br />internal obstacles such as self-doubt, conflict phobia and a<br />feat of what others think into a new foundation of courage,<br />confidence and self-esteem.<br />I particularly liked her use of real life stories and examples<br />(including her own) . . . also, the accompanying exercises<br />were very insightful.<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />We are all here for a very short, indeterminate amount of time. It's imperative that we use this time well by making our spiritual development a top priority. As you do, I can assure you that you will begin to understand and fulfill you unique purpose here on Earth. This commitment takes time, energy, and a willingness to open your heart and your mind to change. The first step is to realize that you are the force for change in your life. No one else can set your destiny, settle your grievances, heal you wounds, or tell you what to do. You must take full responsibility for an amazing gift that was bestowed upon you at birth--the power to create you life as a work of art.<br />With this perspective in mind, you naturally begin to view each<br />life experience through the lens of the question &quot;How can I use this situation to serve my personal growth?&quot; For example, when a driver cuts you off in traffic, you see it as a sign that you may need to slow down or not take things so personally, rather than view it as someone doing something to you. Or when you lose your job unexpectedly, you decide to reevaluate the direction of your life's work instead of seeing it as life handing you a raw deal. Of course it's important to allow yourself to experience and express all of the feelings that accompany these types of situations. The point is to move beyond blame and criticism to a more empowering position--one where you recognize that you have the creative power to use any situation to your advantage.<br />Check out the list below for some ideas on how to shift<br />your language:<br />Old Words:  New Words<br />&quot;I think&quot;:  &quot;I know&quot;<br />&quot;I'll try&quot;:  &quot;I will&quot;<br />&quot;Maybe&quot;:  &quot;Definitely&quot;<br />&quot;I'm not sure&quot;:  &quot;I'm positive&quot;<br />&quot;I guess&quot;:  &quot;I'll confirm that&quot;<br />&quot;I'm sorry&quot;:  &quot;I'm confident&quot;<br />&quot;I'm so stupid&quot;:  &quot;I need a break&quot;<br />&quot;It doesn't matter&quot;:  &quot;Here's what I want&quot;<br />&quot;We'll see&quot;:  &quot;I will&quot;g you a raw deal.

You might get hurt, but it's the<br />only way to live life completely.<br />Create a little signal only your wife knows so that you can show her you love her across the room.<br />Remember that everyone you meet is afraid of something, loves<br />something, and has lost something.<br />Remember that just the moment you say, &quot;I give up,&quot; someone else seeing the same situation is saying, &quot;My, what a great opportunity.&quot;<br />When you lose, don't lose the lesson.<br />Don't marry a woman who picks at her food.<br />Never miss a chance to dance with your wife.<br />Ask yourself if you would feel comfortable giving your two best<br />friends a key to your house. If not, look for some new best friends.<br />Take the stairs when it's four flights of less.<br />When talking to your doctor, don't let him or her interrupt or end the session early.

I have found, conversely, that when you really examine your life head-on, you can be painfully honest about what you want to accomplish throughout your life. It is a bit uncomfortable writing down big dreams because they may sound highly ambitious or self-aggrandized, but unless you allow yourself to imagine your ideal life, you can never begin to make it happen. Imagining yourself at the end of your life looking back is a helpful tool to articulate what it is that you hope to accomplish during your lifetime.<br />The formula to find your path to fulfillment is astonishingly simple: Follow your preferences, and they will lead you to your path. Find what brings you joy and satisfaction, and trust that it will also bring you prosperity. Find what makes your blood boil, and trust that it will also fuel your existence. Discover what makes your heart sing, and trust that it will create music in your life. In other words, find what matters to you, and trust that it is the signpost you have been looking for.<br />One of the things that my clients and friends both love and hate me for is the fact that upon hearing them express a vision, I immediately ask, &quot;When would you like to do that?&quot; I do this because I am eager to see them have what they want.

Auditions, most struggling actors will<br />tell you, [stink]. You get a few pages of a script and read it over and over in hopes of picking up some clue to the character, some insight that will give you an edge in translating written words into a living, breathing, engaging, and profound approximation of human behavior. If you can do this better than any of the other actors in the competition for the role, you get to eat; if you can't, you don't. At least, you delude yourself into thinking it's that simple. It's not.<br />At one point or another, during times of personal struggle or<br />loss, we've all heard people tell us they would \\"pray for us.\\" Just an expression, I'd always thought, until I felt the power of that sentiment when it is offered, and meant, by tens of thousands of people.

I was really<br />being defensive.<br />* Women will appreciate any sincere compliment, but when<br />a man puts a little more thought into his words, she<br />will like it more. . . . The more special the adjective, the<br />more special she feels. These are some examples:<br />PLAIN COMPLIMENT (PC) vs. JUICY COMPLIMENT (JC)<br />PC, That is a nice picture. JC, You are incredibly artistic.<br />PC, You look good tonight. JC, You look magnificent tonight.<br />PC, You have a nice smile. JC, You have a radiant smile.<br />PC, You look good.

I found it both amusing and enlightening . . . and while it isn't my typical reading fare, I found it fun to learn about cross-dressing and what exactly it entails. In addition, I also believe it gave me some insight into the female psyche.<br />Yet no need to fear. I don't see myself becoming a cross-dresser<br />any time in the near future, particularly since I like my<br />mustache. And Veronica notes that \\"no applicant is ready<br />for the freewheeling life an academy deb if he is not ready<br />to let go of a handlebar.<br />\\"Yet,\\" she went on to say, \\"there are exceptions to every rule,<br />even this. I relaxed my rule once when a Hassidic Jewish man<br />applied for entrance. I knew that his long beard and side-curls<br />were part of his religious observance and thus not to be removed. Under all of that hair, his long-lashed eyes emanated sincerity and earnestness, so I took pity on him. We used a veil and turned him into an Arabian princess, not only accomplishing his transformation but doing our bit to heal Mideast relations.<br /><br />There is a basic difference between the way women walk and<br />the way men walk. Men take control of the earth. Their feet are<br />planted firmly on the ground. Women go with the flow. We dance<br />through life. High heels are designed to complement that dancing,light-footed movement. In the days before sidewalks, the entire base of the shoe was often elevated. These early platform shoes made it possible to rise above the muck. Men wore them as well as ladies. But while men have toppled from their pedestals, we ladies remain there, usually being admired. High heels show off the calves and other parts of the anatomy to advantage. The higher the pump, the higher the rump. In high heels the buttocks are raised to provocative heights, inviting admiring glances. Just as some women choose not to wear high heels because they do not want to invite those glances, many men are starved for that attention. In high heels, our students' legs appear longer and, though our girl<br />may be concerned with her height, her legs can never be too long.<br /><br />Even before the first official Voice class, new students at Miss Vera's Finishing School receive some instruction on girl talk.

We start be refining speech in small, simple ways. Say, \\"Yes.\\" The phrase \\"Yes, Miss Vera\\" is music to my ears.

As you read each play<br />approach it with the following questions in mind:<br />What can I learn from this play that will help me know myself better?<br />What can I learn from this play that will help me understand others better?<br />(It's useful to think of specific people you might wish to<br />understand better.)<br />[Thomas Jefferson's ten-point plan for personal improvement]<br />1. Never put off til tomorrow what you can do today. (Jefferson rose<br />before sunrise each day to get a head start on his massive to-do lists.)<br />2. Never trouble another for what you can do yourself. (Jefferson<br />believed in the spirit of personal as well as political independence<br />and thought that it began with the ability to solve one's own problems.)<br />3. Never spend your money before you have it. (Jefferson learned<br />this the hard way by violating this advice repeatedly and suffering<br />the consequences.)<br />4. Never buy what you do not want because it is cheap; it will be<br />dear to you. (Jefferson loved life and saw material objects as means<br />to experience rather than ends in themselves.)<br />5. Pride costs us more than hunger, thirst and cold. (At the center<br />of power for many years, Jefferson witnessed the disastrous<br />effects of egotism and believing one's own publicity on many<br />powerful people.)<br />6. We never repent of having eaten too little. (Jefferson's<br />extraordinary vitality was in part a function of his healthy diet and<br />his practice of leaving the table before he was full.)<br />7. Nothing is troublesome that we do willingly. (As a natural<br />optimist, Jefferson was able to choose to see the best in all life's<br />circumstances. This was his way of saying, \\"To get what you<br />choose, choose what you've got.\\")<br />8. How much pain has cost us the evils which have never<br />happened. (Jefferson reminds us that worry is pointless. His<br />optimism helped protect him from anxiety about the future.)<br />9. Take things away by their smooth handle. (Jefferson was an<br />elegant mind with a talent for finding the path of least resistance.)<br />10. When angry, count ten before you speak; if very angry, a<br />hundred. (As a man of the Enlightenment, Jefferson championed<br />the voice of reason and understood the great power of words to<br />cause harm as well as good.)<br />[an exercise to help you think like Einstein]<br />In your notebook or on a piece of scrap paper, take two minutes<br />and write down as many uses as you possibly can for a paper clip.<br />How many uses did you write down?

Yet it<br />can still be applied today to deal with the same essential<br />issues that were in vogue then: pursuit of health, prosperity<br />and happiness.<br />This excellent book succinctly shows how any room can<br />be designed to help get the life you want . . . there were many<br />memorable passages; among them:<br /><br />Spray a cleansing mist along the baseboards and into all the corners to revitalize a space. Cleansing mists contain citrus oil and can be purchased where health food and aromatherapy products are sold. Or make your own be adding a couple of drops of orange or lemon essential oils to an atomizer filled with water.<br />One of the quickest ways to calm a bedroom down (along with its<br />occupants) is to remove or over the mirrors. . . . You can treat large mirrors, with beautiful curtains or shades that can be opened by day and closed by night. Other mirrors can be moved to a more active room or draped with fabric at night. This is especially important if the bedroom's occupants are not sleeping well there.<br />Do you believe in yourself? Do you hold the vision of being a great success? Have you clearly defined your purpose in life? Meditate on how to align your purpose in life with your professional goals.

I<br />just heard him on a PBS special, in which he described how he<br />often sends those who write him a gift for no special reason . . . so when he graciously sent me his live lecture tape series, SECRETS OF YOUR OWN HEALING POWER, I rushed to listen to it . . . my reaction: WOW!<br />As is the case with any book or tape put out by Dyer, you'll be<br />inspired and informed when experiencing it . . . in addition, you'll be entertained (as was the group of chiropractic professionals fortunate to be able to hear him).<br />He emphasizes that the secrets to healing are not somewhere &quot;out<br />there,&quot; but rather, healing is something that takes place inside each and every one of us, occurring when we &quot;connect to our Source&quot; and bring Spirit to the disease.&quot; He emphasizes that healers need to be able to banish doubt and see their clients as individuals who already possess the capacity to heal themselves. That is, those with health challenges need to have someone in their energy field who truly believes that healing can take place.<br />These other observations by Dyer also caught my attention:<br />Doctors when they misdiagnose . . . do they then agree to having<br />misbilled?<br />When you place a label on somebody you negate them.

A one-time &quot;fat kid with a stutter&quot; from Long Island, he preferred his Twinkies to the weights his father bought him until, as a teen, he began working out and tapped into an area of his imagination that gave him a vision of what he could achieve.<br />In this inspiring book, he shares his life-changing lessons on success.<br />There's nothing earth-shattering, here, but I did find some good ideas and stories . . . also, I liked Jake's easygoing approach . . . although I have heard most of the<br />lessons (or variations of them) before, I still liked the book--and the positive approach it<br />took.<br />To quote Steinfeld: &quot;It is important for you to note right now that what has happened to you in the past or even the circumstances that exist for you right now no longer matter. From this point on, the quality of your life will change for the better minute by minute, page by page, as you follow the lessons in this book.&quot;<br />And, in particular, the following passage made a lot of sense to me:<br />&quot;I have a friend who attended one of those race-car driver's schools and they had a session on what to do when your car is spinning toward the retaining wall on the track. The instructor told him that the biggest mistake drivers make when their car goes into a spin is to look at the wall, because people unconsciously tend to steer where they are looking. Over and over they practiced looking away from the wall in order to regain control and to steer away from disaster. The wall represents failure, and if you focus on failure, you will fail. But if you look away from failure, you can focus instead on doing what you need to do to steer toward success.&quot;	2001-12-25

I very much liked it--even though I no longer play the game . . . it was fascinating to hear what Woods has to say with respect to how he hits various shots . . . in addition, I liked his recollections of how he learned the game from his dad and how he competes today against the best players on courses from around the world.<br />One chapter (&quot;How to Master the Mind&quot;), in particular, caught my<br />attention because it applies to virtually any situation in life . . . he presents the following building blocks to mental toughness:<br />Learn from your experiences, both positive and negative.<br />Take ownership of your mistakes.<br />Never make the same mistake twice.<br />Don't be afraid to turn a negative into a positive.<br />Never beat yourself up because there are plenty of people who will do it for you.<br />But in the book he does more than just list the above; he gives<br />specific examples from his own career.<br />And I'm still laughing at his top 5 mind games:<br />1. Really lean on a drive, then react as if you miss-hit it.<br />2. On your way to a drive that you've nutted, take a quick look at your opponent's ball<br />as you walk by, hesitate for a moment as if you think it's yours, then proceed to your drive.<br />3. Concede two or three short puts, then make your opponent putt a kick-in.<br />4. Make your opponent putt several gimmes, then concede a questionable two-footer.<br />5. After you've outdriven an opponent on a day marred by swirling winds, take a club you have no intention of hitting on your apporach shot and make a few practice swings. If he's stealing your club selection, you might get him to guess wrong.<br />All in all, this is the PERFECT GIFT for any golfer that you might know! And don't forget to get a copy for yourself, too, if you play the game.f you play the game.	2001-12-25

Bush, Susan Sarandon, Dr. Jocelyn<br />Elders, and &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs.

And it's like when I say old Negro spiritual, when we came over here and we were in bondage, we were slaves and we were in the cotton fields.

I also remember the game because Frank Howard hit the hardest ball I've ever seen . . . if memory serves me correctly, it hit the bottom of the center field fence on a fly . . . but I digress . . . I mention the preceding because i recently finished KOUFAX by Edward Gruver, the story of the<br />three-time Cy Young award winner and Jewish icon who refused to pitch on High Holy days . . . this is a MUST READ for any baseball fan . . . it provides insight into the elusive, enigmatic hero who left the spotlight at the height of his powers.<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />Koufax was aware of the edge his fastball gave him in pitcher-batter confrontations, and he used it to his advantage. &quot;The art of pitching,&quot; he said, &quot;is to instill fear in a man by making him flinch.&quot;<br />Koufax enjoyed the confrontations with great hitters. Baseball, he said once, is a form of warfare. He never believed in fraternizing with opposing players, because the guys in the other uniforms represented the enemy. He never wanted to get to know an opponent well enough to feel anything towards them except, as he put it, &quot;sheer hostility.&quot;<br />[on loss of income when he was forced to retire] &quot;. . . let's put it this way. If there was a man who did not have the use of one of his arms and you told him it would coast a lot of money if he could buy back that use, he'd give every dime he had, I believe. That's my feeling, and in a sense, maybe this is what I'm doing. . . . I don't regret one minute of the last twelve years, but I think I would regret one year that was too many.&quot;	2001-12-24

I enjoyed<br />these . . . they reminded me of the type of observations<br />made by George Carlin with the key exception being<br />that they're all clean!<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />As one who enjoys biographical reports of others' lives, I<br />am much more interested in what a man thinks than in the fact<br />that he was born in Seattle, played football for several years,<br />or sleeps in pajama bottoms.<br />People today--especially if they're under forty--often have<br />background, soft-rock music going in their homes or offices,<br />sometimes during important discussions.

I know that I'll be looking for it.<br />I liked many ideas that I got from the book; among them:<br />Have an affair. . . .The idea is to reignite your passion for living, and to see the extraordinary in the ordinary. Remind yourself how precious and how short this adventure really is. I read a great book called A PARENTHESIS IN<br />ETERNITY . . . What a great way to think about the duration of your<br />life--as a blip on a passing screen. We're here for a moment in<br />time--and then we're gone. Why waste one second of self-pity,<br />frustration, and all the rest? Our lives are so much more important than that.<br />Consider how you would respond to the following two sentences spoken by a spouse, lover, or friend. First, \\"I hate my stupid job; (its bad).\\" Or, \\"Do you know what I'd really love to be doing?\\" Wow--what a difference. In the first sentence, you, as the listener or receiver of the complaint, want to leave the room. Your instinct is to pull away. In the second, however, you want to hear more; you want to engage in the conversation because it brings you closer to the person who is sharing.<br />Be for something rather than against it. . . . You can see how easy it is to be working with very positive intentions, yet still find a way to drive yourself nuts. Some environmental activists, for example, are doing great things-choosing to be vegetarians, picking up litter, cleaning up the beaches, planting trees, recycling, and raising awareness as well as money for the causes they believe in. Others, however, yell and scream, block traffic, chain themselves to trees, and starve themselves in an attempt to accomplish their goals.nting trees, recycling, and raising awareness as well as money for the causes they believe in.

DAVE BARRY SLEPT HERE was his version of American history. DAVE BARRY DOES JAPAN was a contribution to international peace and understanding from which Japan has not yet fully recovered. DAVE BARRY'S COMPLETE GUIDE TO GUYS is among the best-read volumes in rehab centers and prisons.

Put your hand down on any counter and you risk being stuck to it by the film of ancient syrup spills, and this is unfortunate because hands are utensils here, used for scooping up lettuce onto the salad plates, lifting out pie slices, and even moving hash browns from one plate to another. The regulation poster in the simple unisex rest room admonishes us to wash our hands thoroughly, and even offers instructions for doing so, but there is always some vital substance missing--soap, paper towel, toilet paper--and I never found all three at once.

My second baseman in 1966,<br />Mario Duncan, once was quoted as saying about me, &quot;He doesn't<br />play favorites. All twenty-five guys are his favorites.&quot; It was kind of<br />him to say, and I believe that it's true. Managers who make it<br />their business to keep personal preferences to themselves, to<br />show regard for all employees, and to be scrupulously fair about<br />opportunities, promotions, and perks, will be rewarded with a<br />bunch of highly motivated team players.<br />* During my eight years as a player with the Braves, I was fortunate<br />to hit behind baseball's all-time home run king, Hank Aaron. One<br />day, Hank and I were talking about batting slumps when he made<br />a comment that's stayed with me ever since: &quot;Each at bat is a<br />new day.&quot;<br />* &quot;I hang pictures,&quot; is a phrase I've used whenever I start a new<br />job. . . . When I first managed the Mets in the late 1970s, Boyer,<br />then the Cardinals' manager, visited me in my clubhouse<br />office.

He was baffled by other people's inability to grasp what he was doing. &quot;It's easy to talk to a horse if you understand his language,&quot; he once said. &quot;Horses stay the same from the day they are born until the day they die. . . . They are only changed by the way people treat them.&quot; He believed with complete conviction that no animal was permanently ruined. Every horse could be improved. He lived by a single maxim: &quot;Learn your horse. Each one is an individual, and once you penetrate his mind and heart, you can often work wonders with an otherwise intractable beast.&quot;<br />Most jockeys took a more straightforward approach: the radical diet, consisting of six hundred calories a day. Red Pollard went as long as a year eating nothing but eggs. Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons confessed that during his riding days a typical dinner consisted of a leaf or two of lettuce, and he would eat them only after placing them on windowsills to dry the water out of them. Water, because of its weight, was the prime enemy, and jockeys went to absurd lengths to keep it out of their systems. Most drank virtually nothing. A common practice was to have jockeys' room valet open soda cans by puncturing the top with an ice pick, making it impossible to drink more than a few drops at a time. The sight and sound of water became a torment; Fitzsimmons habitually avoided areas of the barn where horses were being washed because the spectacle of flowing water was agonizing.<br />Somewhere among the railways in the heart of the country, Seabiscuit slipped out of 1938. That year, no individual had known fame and popularity that was as intense and far-reaching. A study of news outlets revealed that the little horse had drawn more newspaper coverage in 1938 than Roosevelt, who was second, Hitler (third), Mussolini (fourth), out of other newsmakers.

Without rancor, I simply allow the other person to be right, which is all their ego really wants.<br />Recently, my brother was telling me about all the people he was meeting who has prostate cancer. &quot;It's like an epidemic,&quot; he said. &quot;Three guys down the street, two at work, all in the past week or so.&quot; My immediate response to him was, &quot;I will not think thoughts of prostate cancer.&quot; When a friend who had recently had a hip replacement due to rheumatoid arthritis told me that with all my running I was a perfect candidate for a hip replacement, my immediate response was, &quot;I will not have a hip replacement. I don't do rheumatoid arthritis.&quot;<br />Over the years I have had the experience on many occasions of people ordering products, sending me a check, and then a week or so later discovering that the person had insufficient funds to cover the costs of the materials I had purchased and mailed.  There was a time when I reacted to this experience of being defrauded with complaints about how irresponsible and immoral this was. About five years ago I did an about-face.  Every time this happened to me I mailed the person a free gift of an autographed book, and requested payment for the bounced check. The response was amazing. About ninety-eight percent of the people who received a free gift in response to their NSF check, not only returned the money, but took the time to write a lovely letter of apology as well.

Occasionally, it--the marriage, Jack--would be clear to her. At other times, there would be interference, a staticky sound between them.  At those times, it would be as though she couldn't quite hear Jack, as though his messages to her were drifting in the wrong direction through the stratosphere.<br />What possible answers can any man give to the accusation that he hasn't recently told his wife that she is beautiful? She thinks to herself. That he has simply forgotten? That in fact he thinks it all the time, but just doesn't say it? That he thinks she is desperately beautiful right that very minute?<br />That night, Kathryn and Jack make love as they have not done in months--with a ragged edge, as though playing out the rest of the scene with open mouths and small bites, locked thighs and pinned wrists. And the voracious momentum of that night changes, for a time, the tenor of their marriage, so that they look more often into each other's eyes as they pass in the hallway, trying mutely to say something meaningful, and kiss each other with more enthusiasm whenever they meet, in this house outside by the cars or even, several times, in public, which pleases Kathryn. But after a while, that too passes, and she and Jack go back to normal, as they have been before, which is to say that they, like all the other couples Kathryn has ever known, live in a state of gentle decline, of being infinitesimally, but not agonizingly, less than they were the day before.to normal, as they have been before, which is to say that they, like all the other couples Kathryn has ever known, live in a state of gentle decline, of being infinitesimally, but not agonizingly, less than they were the day before.	2001-11-04

It's something that goes with me<br /> wherever I go, and no one can take that away from me.&quot;<br /> In this light, education just isn't part of the American dream,<br /> it's a tool for living the dream every day. Once gained, nothing<br /> can take it away.<br /> I have to wonder how one person [Sister Sylvia Schmidt]<br /> manages to do so much. Life presents us with countless<br /> crises to be addressed, and America's particular list of<br /> problems can seen overwhelming at times. In Sylvia's<br /> view, though, these are opportunities for improving<br /> ourselves through service. Her advice? &quot;Number one<br /> is not to try to take it all on.&quot; Instead, she counsels,<br /> &quot;Say 'What is the one thing I can do?' and enjoy doing<br /> it. I think that's the most important thing, not to do it<br /> just out of a sense of guilt or obligation. It's got to be<br /> a real enrichment in our lives.&quot; With words like these,<br /> backed by a lifetime of good work, Sister Sylvia reminds<br /> us that sowing should have as prominent a role in the<br /> American dream as reaping. And as we sow, I think she<br /> would agree, so shall we all reap.<br /> Everyone in this book offered their personal take on<br /> the American dream, and their ideas were as diverse as<br /> they. All, however, were dedicated reamers, in the best<br /> possible sense. Perhaps because of his youth, it was<br /> Josh [Marcus] who provided the most Utopian, the<br /> most impossibly beautiful vision. &quot;I think the American<br /> dream is for a prefect society,&quot; he said plainly. &quot;For<br /> everybody to be equal. For everybody to have the same<br /> opportunities in life. For the rich to give back to the poor,<br /> and for the poor to help themselves. And everyone<br /> getting along and having lots of peace.&quot; Thank you, Josh,<br /> for the answer. If I had to pick just one, that would be it.edicated reamers, in the best<BR> possible sense.

If he<br /> ran the corner grocery store, he would instill in everyone there<br /> the same mindset. And if he offered you advice, I think that this<br /> would be at its core: Always think of yourself as entering with<br /> other people into partnerships for living well. This highly general<br /> truth about the deep beauty of business can provide us with an<br /> important perspective on many specific decisions we face. We<br /> should always be asking ourselves whether what we contemplate<br /> doing will enhance or diminish this crucial function of the<br /> business within our own domain of influence. Are we building<br /> partnerships for living well?<br /> I saw the professor later that day and asked him about it. He<br /> answered with a big smile, &quot;At Hampden-Sydnery, we have a rule<br /> that every student must greet everyone they pass on campus.&quot;<br /> I said, Why do you have a rule like that?&quot; And he explained, &quot;At<br /> Hampden-Syndey, we believe that etiquette is where ethics<br /> meet everyday life. . . .

I found myself caught<br />up in the life of our second President, and how it involved love,<br />friendship and betrayal.<br />Not only did I feel that I got to know Adams, but McCollough<br />also gave me a real feel for his contemporaries including<br />George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton,<br />Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson, and John Quincy Adams (his<br />adored son whom he would live to see become President).<br />There were many memorable passages (often taken from<br />his diaries and letters to his beloved wife Abigail); among them:<br />Possibly it was his first or second day back in Philadelphia, in<br />early 1776, after the long wintry journey from home, that Adams,<br />in his room at Mrs. Yard's, drew up a list of what he determined<br />to see accomplished. Or as appears more likely, from its<br />placement in his diary, the list had been composed earlier,<br />somewhere en route. Undated, it included, &quot;An alliance to be<br />formed with France and Spain&quot;; &quot;Governments to be assumed<br />by every colony''; &quot;Powder mills to be guilt in every colony and<br />fresh efforts to make saltpeter [for the making of gunpowder].&quot;<br />And, on the second of the two small opposing pages in the<br />diary, he wrote, a &quot;Declaration of Independency.&quot;<br />[describing Marie Antoinette] She was an object too sublime<br />and beautiful for my dull pen to describe. . . . Her dress was<br />everything art and wealth could make it. One of the maids<br />of honor told me she had diamonds upon her person to the<br />value of eighteen million livres, and I always thought her<br />majesty much beholden to her dress. . . . She had a fine<br />complexion indicating her perfect health, and was a handsome<br />woman in her face and figure. . . . The Queen took a large<br />spoonful of soup and displayed her fine persona and graceful<br />manner, in alternately looking at the company in various parts<br />of the hall and ordering several kinds of seasoning to be brought<br />to her, by which she fitted her supper to her taste. When this<br />was accomplished, her Majesty exhibited to the admiring<br />spectators the magnificent spectacle of a great queen<br />swallowing her royal supper in a single spoonful, all at once.<br />This was all performed like perfect clockwork, not a feature<br />of her face, nor a motion of any part of her person, especially<br />her arm and her hand could be criticized as out of order.<br />&quot;Popularity was never my mistress, nor was I ever, or shall I<br />ever be a popular man,&quot; Adams had written to James Warren<br />at the start of the year, 1787, to say he had just completed a<br />book that was almost certain to make him unpopular. &quot;But<br />one thing I know, a man must be sensible of the errors of the<br />people, and upon his guard against them, and must run the<br />risk of their displeasure sometimes, or he will never do them<br />any good in the long run.&quot;a handsome<BR>woman in her face and figure. . . .

Having read or heard other books by Elaine St. James (SIMPLIFY<br />YOUR LIFE, INNER SIMPLICITY, etc.), I found myself looking<br />forward to reading her latest: SIMPLY YOUR WORK LIFE . . . I<br />was not disappointed in it, and you won't be either--even if you<br />have not read anything else by the author . . . she presents<br />both big and small ways to scale down and simplify life on<br />the job . . . in doing so, she will help you understand the<br />difference between making work easier and making it<br />easier to do more work.<br />For example, there were these thought-provoking passages:<br />One way to seize time is to get into the habit of taking<br />five minutes at the end of your day to clean up your space<br />and get organized for the next day's work. Even if you're<br />in the middle of a project you want to continue with the<br />next day, you'll find it helpful to straighten up your paper<br />and files and put away books, folders, notes, and other<br />materials for which you don't have an immediate need.<br />One of the most important steps you can take to<br />reduce the pressure you put on yourself is to avoid<br />making promises you can't keep that will throw the rest of your<br />life out of balance. So if your boss asks when you expect to have<br />a particular project completed, never, ever answer on the spot.<br />Always respond with &quot;Let me figure it out and I'll get back to<br />you.&quot; Then actually take the time to realistically estimate,<br />given your other duties, when you could have the project<br />completed. Then double that estimate.<br /><br />One of the main concerns Marie had when she was trying<br />to decide whether to take the leap and go for her doctorate<br />was that she was too old. I pointed out that I hadn't written<br />my first book until I was forty-five. Julia child didn't make her<br />first television appearance until she was fifty-five. Thomas<br />Edison didn't discover electricity until he was fifty-nine.<br />Eleanor Roosevelt didn't become a delegate to the United<br />Nations until she was sixty. And, as it turned out, Marie's<br />own husband, Joe, didn't do his most creative engineering<br />until he was sixty-two.ate to the United<BR>Nations until she was sixty.

I typically enjoy<br />such multigenerational stories and this one did not<br />disappoint . . . it did get a bit confusing at times (following<br />several story lines, back and forth, over various decades) . . . but<br />that's probably because I only had access to a 4-tape<br />abridgment and seemed to miss some important details as<br />a result.	2001-10-16

I loved<br />it! . . . you'll often find yourself thinking--as I still am--about the<br />numerous &quot;Pat Croce Pointers&quot; . . . they emphasize valuable<br />lessons on goal-setting, sales and marketing, communication,<br />creative thinking, desire, dedication, and much more . . . I only<br />regret that the 76ers may soon be losing the charismatic Croce,<br />but regardless, methinks that you will not have heard the last of him.<br />There were many memorable passages; among them:<br />When you're Michael Jordan, you're never allowed to take a<br />night off because somebody may be in the audience who's<br />never seen you before and never will get to see you again. That's<br />a philosophy worth imitating.<br />Fortunately, our employees took to it [paying careful attention<br />to detail] instantly. In turn, I consistently let them know they were<br />appreciated. I made sure our managers lavished compliments,<br />both verbal and written. And I averaged about 50 personal notes<br />a week myself. Positive reinforcement is a wondrous thing. It<br />begets itself.<br />Want to know another great way to let an employee know how<br />much you value him or her?

Jay O. Sanders, long one of my favorite character<br />actors, did a superb job of narration . . . he shifted effortelessly<br />between characters, but perhaps most amazing was the fact<br />that I did not even recognize Sanders' voice--a real tribute to him.	2001-09-30

However, my favorite part dealt with: eight rules you can break . . . to cite just two:<br />Never split an infinitive Generally you should refrain from splitting an infinitive when doing so causes confusion or awkward rhythm. for instead, instead of  writing, &quot;It is sometimes wrong to completely, absolutely and totally separate a verb from to,&quot; you should write, &quot;It is sometimes wrong to separate a verb completely, absolutely and totally from to.&quot;<br />Never end a sentence with a preposition In some sentences, we actually do want to emphasize the final preposition as in, &quot;He doesn't know what a turn signal is for,&quot; or &quot;She didn't realize what this was all about.&quot;	2000-12-04
