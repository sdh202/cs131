I purchased my copy on Saturday morning, and had completed my reading my Sunday afternoon. <br /> <br />It is my intent to provide some commentary on this book, without accidentally \\"spoiling the plot\\" for those who have yet to read. <br /> <br />There are quite a few positives to this book.   <br /> <br />*  The book is tightly written, much more so than volumes 4 and 5 which, at least in the mind of this reviewer, suffered from a lack of editing. <br /> <br />*  The plot is appropriately \\"moved along\\".  A difficulty with a popular series is the tendency to get \\"bogged down\\" in a story-line and lose focus.  J.K. Rowling avoids that here. <br /> <br />*  The story includes several of the humorous conventions we've come to expect in the \\"Harry Potter\\" stories.  An example is the amusing scene with the Durselys in the beginning of the book.  In the opinion of this reviewer, such a humorous interlude is something most readers have come to expect.  Similar humorous episodes help keep the tension from becoming overwhelming. <br /> <br />*  In spite of the previous point, the tension in this book certainly mounts.  There are times in which the plot is rather dark.  In this, the volume certainly has more in common with volumes 4 and 5, than with the first three.  I'm probably going to put off letting my 10-year-old read the book for a little while. <br /> <br />*  Again, like the previous two volumes, there is a death.  No plot spoiler here, though! <br /> <br />*  Again, without spoiling anything, I felt that J.K. Rowling was particularly effective at casting serious doubts upon the reliability of one of main characters -- a character she has been building upon for the previous five volumes. <br /> <br />A few minor quibbles: <br /> <br />*  In volumes four and five, quite a few interesting characters were introduced.  With a few exceptions (Tonks being the most obvious) these characters were largely relegated to the background.  (I would have thoroughly enjoyed some more \\"Mad-Eye Moody\\")! <br /> <br />*  Harry ENJOYS Quiddich.  One begins to be tired of him missing every important match! <br /> <br />*  The ending, while satisfying in its own way, makes one wonder how J.K. Rowling will be able to \\"wrap things up\\".  If Harry truly does not return to school, the entire \\"each book equals one year at school\\" theme rather disappears.  Or is Ms. Rowling leaving the door open for more books? <br /> <br />Overall, a very solid effort -- one of the better books in the series.  Enjoy! <br /> <br />Four very solid stars.	2005-07-18

(Readers of \\"The Cat Who Played Brahams\\" will remember Qwill's cottage.)  With Polly out of town, Qwill feels that \\"getting away from it all\\" would, in fact, be a good idea. <br /> <br />Alas, nothing ever goes as planned for Mr. Q!  All he wants is to have a carpenter add an addition to his cabin . . . and, strangely enough, the carpenters in town seem to be disappearing one by one. <br /> <br />In this addition to \\"The Cat Who . . .\\" series, we are introduced to John Bushland, the photographer from nearby Lockmaster -- a character who will reappear in later books.  We learn that Qwill has (once again) terribly bad luck with regard to boating.  And Koko and Yum Yum are ever their charming selves.  Indeed, it is Koko who is able to clue Qwill into who has it in for carpenters! <br /> <br />While some of \\"The Cat Who . . .\\" books have fairly thin plots, the mystery here is good and well-crafted, with a psychological twist not necessarily found in other books in the series. <br /> <br />For my money, this is certainly one of the better additions to this series.	2005-05-02

The \\"K\\" mansion has burned down, and Qwill decides to donate the property to the theater club.  Unfortunately, just before the first big show (Arsnic and Old Lace) the body of the one of the prominent members of the community is found, along with his new wife.  Will Qwill and the cats be able to solve this one?  Or will the murderer get off scot free? <br /> <br />There is a lot of good to be said for this installment of \\"The Cat Who . . .) series.  We are re-introduced to an interesting character from \\"The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern\\" and to a charming new character, Eddington, the eccentric used book dealer.  Arch Riker, Iris Cobb, and of course, Polly all have roles to play as well. <br /> <br />As an interesting note, the book is not divided into chapters, but rather into scenes and acts -- all part of the \\"theater\\" theme. <br /> <br />For fans of the series, this is one of the better ones.	2005-05-02

I don't think that anyone can honestly deny this. <br /> <br />Item:  Jose Canseco has many, many problems.  These include (but certainly are not limited to) years of steroid abuse; JUSTIFYING and trying to LEGITIMIZE steroids and performing enhancing drugs; an ego the size of the Grand Canyon (in spite of what he says, he was NEVER the \\"best\\" player in all of baseball); and a well-established credibility problem. <br /> <br />Does it sometimes take a Canseco-like figure to draw attention to real problems?  Yes -- and for that, I have given the book more than a single star. <br /> <br />Does it necessarily follow that Canseco's allegations are all true?  No, it does not.   <br /> <br />Let's look at some more facts: <br /> <br />Item:  In spite of what Canseco claims steroids did for him (positively) as a player, he retired -- in pathetic condition -- at the age of 37, with significantly sub-par Hall of Fame credentials.  To me, this says something significant. <br /> <br />Item:  On the one hand, Canseco makes certain claims about former teammates (McGwire, Palmerio, Gonzalez, etc.)  Whether or not these claims are true, since Canseco actually played with these guys, the claims need to be taken more seriously.  ON THE OTHER HAND, Canseco also makes certain claims about other Major League Baseball players who were NOT teammates (Bret Boone, Brady Anderson, etc.)  For me, this is MUCH more problematic.  It is hearsay at best, and slander at worst. <br /> <br />Item:  Canseco has reason to be jealous of some of the players he accuses.  Two examples are McGwire and Palmerio.  Both these men have legitimate Hall of Fame credentials -- something Canseco desperately wanted and never achieved.  Envy and hubris are dangerous emotions. <br /> <br />Item:  Several players have issued strong denials concerning the allegations in this book.  When dealing with situations which are nothing more than hearsay, such denials carry AT LEAST as much weight as the accusations.  The onus is NOT on McGwire or Palmerio, etc. to prove their innocence, but rather on Canseco to prove their guilt.  (Innocent until proven guilty is an American tradition even older than baseball!) <br /> <br />Item:  Finally, in my opinion, Canseco has made a serious mistake in targeting mostly Hispanic players.  (Especially since he, himself, complains that Hispanic players are never given the benefit of the doubt!)  A specific case in point:  Rafael Palmerio.  Even a cursory glance at Palmerio's career shows a player who is not particularly \\"flashy\\" (no jump from 40 to 70 homers in a single season) but has been the epitome of consistency over nearly two decades.  (Nor has he particularly shown signs of \\"bulking up\\".)  My guess is, is that Canseco's attack on Palmerio in particular will backfire, especially among the Miami Cuban-American community from which they both come. <br /> <br />My conclusions?  There is a steroid problem in baseball.  Jose Canseco is and was part of that problem.  The problem needs to be addressed in the strongest possible manner.  BUT Canseco's own lack of credibility (over the last two decades) and the personal nature of some of his \\"hearsay\\" attacks, makes me quite suspicious about his motives -- and about the accuracy of his attacks. <br />	2005-02-17

Dr. Martin was a scholar in Semitic languages and this background shows through in this book. <br /> <br />However, this novel is average at best.  Martin takes certain available archeological evidence -- and then from that evidence, constructs an anthropology which may -- or may not -- be accurate, or even reasonable.  This is a novel; this is his perogative.  However, others may disagree with his interpretation. <br /> <br />The book also suffers in that the enormous majority of the text deals with the early days of David's life.  His kingship (which lasted roughly 40 years) is treated only in the final third of the book -- and the seminal events of his kingship are given even less attention.  (Bathsheva shows up only after the book is 3/4 finished; the revolt by Absalom is given only a few pages at the end; etc.) <br /> <br />There is also a \\"re-telling\\" of elements of the story which go beyond a novelist's \\"artistic license\\".  I'll provide some examples: <br /> <br />Item:  It is strongly suggested that David connived at the murder of Abner by Joab.  According to the text itself, Joab killed Abner in cold blood as revenge for Abner's killing of Joab's brother in battle.  (Joab's brother, who was a fairly significant character in the beginning of the book just drops out of sight.) <br /> <br />Item:  It is strongly suggested that Joab killed Absalom in a blind rage having to do with Absalom's revolt.  According to the text, Joab bore Absalom a personal grudge -- and had for years.  This dynamic (which makes the killing make more sense) was missing from the book. <br /> <br />Item:  It is again strongly suggested that Joab's murder of Amasa was also with the connivance of David.  According to the text, Joab had no such order -- and David bore Joab a lasting grudge for the murders of both Abner AND Amasa. <br /> <br />Other readers may notice other examples -- these were just a few which occurred to me. <br /> <br />An enjoyable read -- but not, in my opinion, a really good novel about the subject.	2005-02-14

The fact of the matter?  Vatican II did not authorize the liturgical \\"reforms\\" seen in the 1970's, etc.  Rather, the reform of the liturgy came after the Council -- and the architectural disasters which followed the reform of the liturgy were not \\"authorized\\" (if that is even the correct word) until even later. <br /> <br />The emphases in this book are more (sadly, much, much more) on the warm fuzzies of the \\"gathered assembly\\" than on the profound mysteries of our faith. <br /> <br />A really, really bad book.

Madden introduces us to all aspects of monastic life, beginning with his year as a novice, several years as a student, and finally as a priest.  Many topics are covered, from poverty (No Money) to chasisty (No Wife) to obedience (No Say) to haircuts (\\"Not many barbers become monks, so many monks have to become barbers\\") to diet (fish), etc.    Through it all, one gets a very human, often humorous, but truly honest glimpse of life as a monastic.  The delightful \\"pen and ink\\" style illustrations throughout only add to the book's charm.    Highly recommended.    Five Stars.	2005-01-18

It's now been some years since the \\"Harry Potter\\" books first came out. Book 5 has now been published. In addition, two major motion pictures have now been produced, and a third is due out soon.<br />During this time, I have been repeatedly asked, as a parent, as a clergyman, and as a student of fantasy literature, what my \\"opinion\\" of the series is. After having read all five books, and having seen both movies, I am now prepared to comment.<br />Some people, especially those in the conservative Christian camp, decry the books as inherently Satanic, dealing, as they do, with \\"witchcraft\\", etc. As a conservative Christian father and clergyman, I must admit that I do NOT agree with this assessment -- an assessment made, all to often, by persons who have not actually read the books in question. Do I understand \\"why\\" some would suggest this? Of course I do. The difference, however, lies in the nature of fantasy literature. As can be seen in other fantasy series, (Katherine Kurtz' \\"Saint Camber\\" stories come to mind) the characters in the \\"Harry Potter\\" stories are endowed at birth with certain gifts, powers, etc., not typically applicable to ordinary persons. Much like \\"The Force\\" in the \\"Star Wars\\" stories, this power can be used for good or for evil and is, in and of itself, neither. It is this point which firmly seperates \\"Harry Potter\\" from those who actually believe in and seek to practice the Dark Arts -- activities which conservative Christians -- rightly -- condemn as anti-Scriptural.<br />Thus, it is within this deliberate \\"suspension of belief\\" that these stories must be judged. Are they good fairy tales???<br />\\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban \\" is, in the opinion of this reviewer, the best of all five books so far. I'll grade it as follows:<br />Plot: B+ -- a serious perceived threat against Harry is maintained throughout the entire book.  New characters are added, and old friends reunited.  New professors and classes are introduced.  The wider world of the magical community is explored.  The climax is well handled and ends with a surprisingly human twist.<br />Character Development: B+ -- In the first story, Harry develops quite a relationship with Professor Dumbledore. In the second story, this relationship is poorly handled.  In this third volume, the relationship is back to where it was in book one -- making sense!  The (once again) new Defense against the Dark Arts professor is developed quite well.<br />Setting: B+ -- several cute additions:  The Knight Bus and the village of Hogsmead give some additional venues for action and excitment -- and move the setting beyond merely Hogwarts.<br />Overall, an honest four stars.	2004-02-16

In his first new assignmet, Qwilleran is assigned to cover the \\"Art\\" beat for the \\"Daily Fluxion\\" newspaper -- a subject about which he knows absolutely nothing.  <br />We are also introduced to the remarkable Kao Ko Kung -- a remarkable Siamese cat belonging to a local art critic.  After a rather bizarre murder, the old reporter in Qwilleran comes to the fore and, with the help of Kao Ko Kung (aka Koko) solves the mystery.<br />Gastronomes will love this series of books as much as cat lovers, due to the luscious descriptions of food and drink described.<br />This book is one of the best of the series, and is well worth the time.	2004-02-09

Nowhere else have I seen such in-depth Hebrew word studies (frankly, far beyond my own comprehension!)  Never before have I gained such insights into a book I've read many times.<br />I highly recommend this volume for all serious students of the Minor Prophets -- whether one can read Hebrew or not.<br />The section of photographs is also a nice added touch.	2004-02-09

In &quot;Timemaster&quot; we still have the outstanding science -- with enough of an improvement in character and plot to satisfy most Sci-Fi fans.<br />When dealing with his &quot;neg matter&quot; plants -- and the opportunities such creatures would provide for relatively intstaneous space and time travel, Forward continues to fill his books with life forms radically different from anything we have (or can really imagine) on Earth -- and make them believable.<br />This one is a good read.

Col. Patterson was in a unique position to observe the behavior of former President Clinton, and provides a devastating account of what could &quot;gently&quot; be considered extreme sloppiness with regard to our national security.  Other citizens might well call the president's cavalier attitude toward his most important duty to be negligent and irresponsible.<br />Lt. Col. Patterson makes it clear from the outset that he was not particularly a &quot;political animal&quot;, that he had not even voted in the Presidential election which brought Clinton into power, and spends very little time addressing what his own political beliefs are (if any).  He also makes it clear that it was quite difficult for him to write this book -- about his own commander-in-chief.  Nevertheless, he felt that the truth HAD to be told -- and did so at the risk of alienating many friends and acquaintences.<br />If only a small percentage of what Lt. Col. Patterson writes is accurate, then Bill Clinton will go down in history as the worst president, with regard to foreign policy and American domestic security, the nation has ever seen.<br />Recommended, with grief.	2003-10-02

The science is extremely well-conceived, the aliens (once one accepts the science) are believable, and the character development in all the humans (and all but one of the aliens) is virtually non-existant.  Even the dialogue seems stilted.<br />But then again, one does not read Forward for character development!  In this respect, the true Forward fan will not be disappointed.<br />The book does get rather &quot;preachy&quot; toward the end -- and I find this a bit annoying -- but overall, the book is a good read, with the caveats previously mentioned.	2003-10-01

What a let-down!!!<br />This is an unbelivably poor, hashed-together, novel with a few points of interest (hence 2 stars, instead of 1) but mostly pathetic and unbelivable.  The first section of the book, containing extracts of &quot;journal entries&quot; from Nicole's journal (it's obvious now that Nicole is going to be the main character from here on out) which serve to send forward the plot about 13 years (and entangle the characters in some cloyingly obvious sexual &quot;misunderstandings&quot;).  The remainder of the book is a description of the &quot;colony&quot; from Earth chosen to inhabit Rama, and the disastrous choices made by nearly everyone -- from the politicians on Earth, to most of the colonists.<br />To paraphrase B.B. King, &quot;The Thrill of Rama is Gone&quot;.  I'll give &quot;Rama Revealed&quot; a chance, just because so many loose ends are left hanging.<br />A real disappointment.	2003-10-01

What I found most interesting about the book was the willingness of law enforcement -- on all levels, including the prosecutors who eventually brought him in -- to behave in ways quite similar to those &quot;mobsters&quot; they are trying to control.  <br />There are truly no real &quot;good guys&quot; in this book.<br />As I said, if you like this genre, the book is worth reading.  If the genre doesn't interest you, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a much better story!	2003-10-01

This book went up.  Some.  Not much.<br />The crisis situation in the human colony on Rama has been mitigated (and the humans are pretty pathetic); everyone goes to sleep again for a long, long time; Nicole is reunited with family members she never thought she'd see again (and a rather weak reunion it is, too!); a final &quot;segregation&quot; is made between the &quot;good guys&quot; and the &quot;bad guys&quot; based on a strange, Raman determination which preaches free choice on the one hand -- and no taking of personal responsibility for behavior on the other; -- AND Rama is revealed for what ACTUALLY is.<br />Again, Clarke and Lee delve into theological suppositions in which, frankly, they demonstrate that they are WAAAY over their heads.  This was a serious mistake.  <br />Finally, Nicole makes some choices at the end of the book -- which I won't spoil in this review -- which, frankly, reveal her to be as selfish and shallow as most of the rest of the characters -- a real disappointment.<br />Why the 3rd star?

Much of the book deals with the reactions the various crewmembers have toward the ship -- and with the interpersonal relationships on board.  There is quite a bit of religious and philosophical speculation which some readers will find off-putting.  Clarke and Lee ask some interesting questions, but really don't seem to have the theological background to pull them off.<br />The book is designed to be the first of three, and thus the irritation of the rather abrupt ending is somewhat mitigated.<br />3 1/2 stars, rounded up, because I was entertained -- not because of any brilliance.	2003-09-30

I'll grade it as follows:<br />Plot:  C-  -- entirely too similar to the first volume to be truly creative.  The \\"house elf\\" theme was cute, but ultimately ineffective.  One almost expected a silly scene with the Dursleys.  The flying car???  Nope.  More than half of the book said very little, and did not, in this reviewer's opinion, properly further the plot toward the climax.  The climax was, I will freely admit, well handled and creative -- it just took far too long to get there, and there was far too little to salvage the rest of the book.  And again, the book ends with the loss of the \\"Defense Against the Dark Arts\\" professor.  (CAUTION:  SPOILER!!!  This will be an ongoing theme -- and one which is less and less effective.)<br />Character Development:  C -- In the first story, Harry develops quite a relationship with Professor Dumbledore.  Yet, in this story, until after the climax, Harry's attitude toward Dumbledore doesn't make sense.  Why is he so reluctant to tell this trusted Professor anything at all?  Especially considering the support received in the first book?  This re-structuring of the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore causes the climax not to make the sort of sense it should.  Also never satisfactorally explained is why Hagrid had to be taken away.  Yes, he was \\"set up\\", so to speak, many years earlier.  But the reasons for actually incarcerating him did not make sense to me at all.<br />Setting:  B -- here the author does use a bit of imaginative creativity, but not nearly so much as in the first book.

The climax was, I will freely admit, well handled and creative -- it just took far too long to get there, and there was far too little to salvage the rest of the book.  And again, the book ends with the loss of the \\"Defense Against the Dark Arts\\" professor.  (CAUTION:  SPOILER!!!  This will be an ongoing theme -- and one which is less and less effective.)<br />Character Development:  C -- In the first story, Harry develops quite a relationship with Professor Dumbledore.  Yet, in this story, until after the climax, Harry's attitude toward Dumbledore doesn't make sense.  Why is he so reluctant to tell this trusted Professor anything at all?  Especially considering the support received in the first book?  This re-structuring of the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore causes the climax not to make the sort of sense it should.  Also never satisfactorally explained is why Hagrid had to be taken away.  Yes, he was \\"set up\\", so to speak, many years earlier.  But the reasons for actually incarcerating him did not make sense to me at all.<br />Setting:  B -- here the author does use a bit of imaginative creativity, but not nearly so much as in the first book.  I did enjoy the \\"Whomping Willow\\".  But overall, the setting is very similar.  Not much new here. <br />Overall, I'll give the book a generous 3 stars.  Not as good as the first, but not bad.	2003-03-25

Michael Jones' frontal assult on modernism!<br />In \\"Degenerate Moderns\\", Jones reveals how much of modern society was brought about by persons whose personal lives (and beliefs) could best be described as deviant.  In \\"Dionysos Rising\\", he addresses certain trends in music which somewhat less success.  In this volume, he takes on Walter Gropius and the Balhaus School of Design.  The style is quite different from the previous two books and reads almost like a novel.  In the book we learn how Gropius' own beliefs about sex, family, and religion (and his, shall we say, deviancies in these areas of life) influenced his architectural work.<br />A devastating critique of the International school of architecture in general, and Walter Gropius' work in particular.	2002-11-21

In this volume, Jones tackles the role of modern music in this societal decay.  The chapter on Wagner was very good -- although not nearly enough was said about the importance of Wagner's later work (which caused an irreparable break with Nietzche.<br />The chapters on Nietzche and Schonberg were informative -- but one got the impression that material was being repeated over and over.  A bit of editorial direction would have helped here.<br />When Jones gets into modern pop music, his argument is both strengthened and weakened.  Strengthened by the truly uncontrolled behavior of many of today's rock musicians (to say nothing of the lyrics).  Weakened in the attempt to lump pretty much ALL jazz and pop into one category -- a serious mistake in my estimation.<br />All in all, however, a good book -- but not as good as his first.	2002-11-21

From this call, he never wavered.  This biography details his life, his struggles as a young pastor, and his eventual triumphs as the pastor of New York Avenune Presbyterian Church in Washington, DC and his appointment as Chaplain to the United States Senate.<br />Throughout we're given glimpses of Dr. Marshall's wit, his humor, his zest for life -- and his devotion to his God.  His untimely death at 46 was a great loss to the Christian community.<br />As an additional bonus, several of Dr. Marshall's prayers and sermons can be found in this book as well.<br />A wonderful, inspirational read.<br />Five stars.	2002-09-17

I've been a Lewis fan for 25 years and yet was unaware of his significant contributions in the field of literary criticism.  Also enjoyable was the discussion of Lewis' own tastes in reading as well as his major influences.<br />While the influence Charles Williams had on Lewis (especially in \\"That Hideous Strength\\") was addressed, I was disappointed that Tolkien's influence on Lewis was minimized.  This was, I believe, an oversight.<br />All in all, though, I highly recommend this extremely readable volume.	2002-08-29

It is evident that Mr. Beale has a grasp on many great myths and stories and is (mostly) successful in weaving elements into and out of the story.  It is also evident that he has at least a partial understanding of medieval concepts of angelic hierarchies, etc.<br />For me, the conclusion was less than fully satisfying.  I wish that the decision of Chris for Christ could have been handled a bit more deftly.  Rather, I felt as though I was witnessing a particularly ineffective Altar Call.  As a sacramental Christian, I also wish that Mr. Beale's development of signs and symbols had been handled with more depth.<br />But overall, I truly enjoyed this book and hope that the rest of the series will be able to meet or even exceed the standard which has been set.	2002-08-08

Lewis once pointed out that there are certain issues in which reasonable men may honestly disagree.  Among American Christians, the &quot;Creation vs. Evolution&quot; debate falls into this category, with many persons of good will -- AND strong, personal faith -- on both sides.<br />Sadly, this does not come through in the work of Hovind.  His work has been hammered -- even by other creationists -- for its lack of accuracy.  Even more troubling is his theological insistance that it's &quot;his way or the highway&quot; -- EVEN with regard to other strong, Bible-believing Christians.  It is this tendency to equate Hovind's interpretation with actual inspiration that I find very off-putting.<br />A more reasoned, more irenic approach would facilite the discussion much more readily than what is presented here.	2002-08-08

That is not the purpose of the book.  Rather, Ms. Noonan sets forth a portrait of an ordinary man who rose to the challenge and did great things.  <br />In the tradition of the classic Irish storyteller, Ms. Noonan tries (and for the most part, succeeds) in expressing the humanity of the man who, along with Pope John Paul II, did more to bring about the destruction of communism than any other.<br />One hundred years from now, historians will still be arguing the \\"issues\\" of the Reagan Presidency.  However, as Ms. Noonan clearly suggests, they will not be arguing about the \\"stamp\\" this larger-than-life man placed on the second half of the 20th century.<br />Whether one agrees with Reagan's policies or not, only the most die-hard cynic will fail to be warmed by this tale of humanity and courage.	2002-08-08

Like a previous reviewer, I also note that this book discusses Humanae Vitae far more than Vatican II -- but agree that the fundamental issue IS one of authority in the Church and that the same clerics who wished to deliberately mis-represent the Council are also the ones who protested so vehemently against Humanae Vitae.<br />From the perspective of this non-Roman Catholic reviewer, it is the authority structure available in the Catholic Church which makes it so attractive and Dr. McInerny's strong call to the Church to exert the authority God has given them is refreshing.<br />History has demonstrated time and time again that Christianity cannot function either by democracy or by kowtowing to the lowest common denominator.

As far as that goes, the point is quite valid.<br />However, at times, Kavanaugh seems to be stretching his thesis to include less obvious examples (Schubert, for instance) when more obvious examples could have been used.  (However, he does do the musical world a good service by rehabilitating Wagner and demonstrating that while he was a man with many faults, he cannot and should not be held responsible for the actions of Hitler!) <br />Also frustrating was Kavanaugh's habit of ascribing specific internal motives to several of the featured composers. In addition, there is a strong anti-Catholic bias in the book which I found distasteful.  Those composers with Protestant backgrounds had their Protestantism emphasized, while those with Catholic backgrounds had their Catholicism minimized and even ridiculed.  For me, this was unnecessary and intellectually dishonest. <br />This being said, I would still like to see another volume.  Many, many other composers come to mind which could fill such a book.  And hopefully, some of the anti-Catholic bias could be filtered out.	2002-07-18

The author, a Rome-based journalist, has already been selected by Fox News as their correspondent and &quot;expert&quot; when the time comes.  Especially helpful is the &quot;step-by-step&quot; description of what happens in the Vatican from the moment the Pope dies straight through his Coronation Mass. Also helpful is the information concerning the various &quot;political parties&quot; within the College of Cardinals and useful biographies of those Cardinals whom the author sees as papabile (those for whom election is possible).<br />Less helpful, and indeed off-putting, was the author's obvious bias toward the left wing of the Catholic hierarchy.  This is seen, not only in his direct comments, but also in his subtle ridicule of conservative Cardinals. This ridicule is usually effected by the relating of &quot;humorous&quot; anecdotes which serve to make conservative Cardinals look silly.  The more a Cardinal is portrayed as a moderate or liberal, the less likely the ridicule.<br />Other than this bit of childishness, the book is a valuable tool. But the conservative or traditionalist reader will have (many) moments of (great) annoyance.<br />Three stars.	2002-06-19

He explores the sort of life which might live in such a world.  Most interesting of all, is that he postulates exactly how such a world would function, what the sky would look like from various points, how the laws of physics would operate under conditions of extreme gravity, etc.<br />Don't look for deep character development -- but then again, that's not precisely the point!	2002-03-27

Please note that I don't fault the depth of the book at all, Dr. Hawking has done his best to remove the mathematics and esoteric theorizing.  Nevertheless, unless the reader has a prior basic knowledge of astronomy or cosmology, it's easy to get lost.<br />Dr. Hawking is arguably one of the three greatest physicists of the last 500 years (Newton and Einstein being the others).  In this book, he has skillfully attempted to bridge the gap between the world of the highly technical scientist and the layman who is keenly interested in the world around him -- but is not a scientist.  Dr. Hawking describes what is known about the operation of the universe, what is surmised, and (more interestingly, what remains unknown (quite a bit!)  Throughout, the reader is treated to Dr. Hawking's evident sense of humor and courage through enormous adversity.<br />I have read the book from cover to cover three times -- and by the end of the third attempt, &quot;got it&quot;!  (That is, grasped the basic concepts Dr. Hawking was trying to explain -- the in-depth theories and the math are and will be forever beyond my reach!)<br />I recommend this book.	2002-03-27

But it is in his third essay &quot;The Timeless Momement&quot; where Lobdell demonstrates his insightfulness and creativity.  It is in this essay that the Catholic Christianity of Tolkien is analyzed in light of his created world of Middle-Earth.

This book is a classic example. Most of the attacks are ad hominim in nature, and stem from the fact that Westcott and Hort were instrumental in producing a Greek text of the New Testament which differs in some respects from the Received Text translated by Erasmus in the 16th century.  It is the Received Text upon which the New Testament of the King James Version of the Bible is based.<br />The wise scholar, whether Catholic or Protestant, values the academic integrity behind the original translation of the KJV -- but also recognizes that in the nearly 400 years since that translation was produced, a plethora of new manuscripts have been discovered.  These discoveries must be taken into consideration in order to achieve the best and most faithful translation.<br />Westcott and Hort knew this, and devoted a great deal of their professional lives to the study and transmission of the Word of God.  To malign these men because of a perceived slight to the King James Version is simply wrong -- both historically, academically, and morally.	2002-03-22

(I first found reference to the book on the &quot;Focus&quot; website.)<br />Why was the book written?  In the opinion of this reviewer, the primary purpose was to reassure evangelical Christians that the new interest in Tolkien was &quot;safe&quot; from an evangelical perspective.  While much is made of Tolkien's Christianity, the fact that he was an extremely devout and actively practicing Catholic was somehow left out (as this would possibly alienate some evangelicals).  While I understood why the authors did this, I found it a bit disingenuous.<br />The content of the book itself examined specific positive attributes, demonstrated those attributes using examples from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and then gave Scriptural underpinnings for those attributes, followed by a one-line devotional.  Very nice, in and of itself, but not particularly deep, from either a literary or spiritual perspective.  There were also the odd factual error (which only a Tolkien trivia buff like myself would notice) which should have been caught by the authors or the editors.<br />The best part of the book was relegated to the very end, in which one of the authors gives a brief explication of Tolkien's &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; and discusses the underlying theology behind the concept of the &quot;true myth&quot;.  This should have been in the introduction -- not relegated to the end.<br />If this book convinces strict evangelicals that Tolkien is &quot;OK&quot;, then the book is worth it.  But for me, far more could have been (and should have been) said.	2002-03-18

It's obvious that Mr. Smith truly loves \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".  That comes through, if nothing else does.  The premise of the book is also good.  However, Mr. Smith does not begin to go deeply enough -- and he doesn't use valuable, readily accessible source material which would have strengthened his case dramatically.  (Two examples which come to mind are \\"Letters by JRR Tolkien\\" and \\"The Timeless Momement:  Christian Doctrine in a Pre-Christian Age\\".)<br />Smith does recognize that Tolkien was a devout Catholic -- but fails to bring this perspective into the book's development.  In addition, the two most important virtues (according to Tolkien's own letters) found in the book, Pity and Mercy, were not dealt with in nearly enough depth -- and this is a loss.<br />From a literary basis, Mr. Smith does make some basic errors in fact.  (For example, the length of time between Bilbo's departure and Frodo's departure was 17 years, not 12 as was stated twice.) From my perspective, he seriously misunderstands the character of Aragorn (and to a lesser extent, Merry and Pippin).<br />Why then the (almost) four stars?  Because the passion in Smith's writing does come through, as does his humanness and his love for the subject.  Mr. Smith has taken an enormous risk in revealing the deep parts of his soul to be shot at by callous reviewers!  I respect this -- and I respect that Mr. Smith has made the attempt to bridge the gap between merely an enjoyable read and a spiritual read.  I hope that he continues to make the attempt and that his future attempts are more successful.	2002-03-18

Goldberg has had the temerity to speak out about the elephant in the living room of American politics which most others choose to ignore.  Yes, 'most' of the mainstream media 'does' operate from a Left to Far Left bias -- much more so than the average mainstream American (Democrat OR Republican).<br />Why should this book anger the Right?  Goldberg has clearly demonstrated what the Right has suspected for quite some time.  However, he has done so in such a way that the value the Right could have derived from this book is minimized.  Goldberg himself is operating from the perspective of a liberal -- in other words, he's not completely without bias himself.  And the personal anger with which the book is written is enough to cause some readers to write the entire work off as unnecessarily subjective.<br />However, for all of Goldberg's anger, what has really been incredible about this book is the anger of those from within the professional media circles.  For me, this is very telling.  The media bosses are not trying to refute the book; rather, they have been engaged in ad hominim attacks and character assassination attempts.  This suggests to me that Goldberg is right far more often than he is wrong -- and that he is being crucified by his former allies for having the nerve to &quot;come clean&quot; about a subject recognized as true.<br />A valuable book; a needed book; but a book with serious flaws which has limited its potential usefulness.  3.5 stars, rounded up.	2002-03-11

The title of this mathematics textbook indicates its intended audience:  \\"Management, Life and Social Sciences\\".

He does his research and has the knack of being able to &quot;get into&quot; other cultures.<br />The premise of this book:  two Oxford graduate students who get transported through a sacred cairn into Another Place -- is an interesting theme and Lawhead works it fairly well.  The character development is lacking at times and the development of character motives can be unnecessarily slow but there are moments of brilliance which do make the book worthwhile.  (I particularly loved the encounter with the Serbian and his restaurant.)<br />However, JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis, and even Charles Williams have nothing to fear here -- Lawhead comes nowhere near to their level (or even to the level of Robert Jordan).<br />Read this book, enjoy the series -- but don't expect &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.	2002-02-14

It won't go down in history as a great novel!<br />The premise of corruption in the Church involving international bioterrorism and an international hitman is timely considering the world today -- but some of the plot turns left me shaking my head in disbelief.  Although most of the main characters of the novel were clergy or religious, the book is not particularly religious and gives virtually no insight into how a member of the clergy would spiritually respond to the terrorist scenarios envisioned in the book.  I also found the sex scenes to be a bit gratuitous.<br />All in all -- the book was an enjoyable diversion for a few evenings -- but probably not something I'd read again.	2002-02-14

This book, the fifth installment in Allen Drury's &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; series, details the very brief presidency of Edwin Jason.  President Jason, launched into the White House by the efforts of numerous violent groups, is an unwitting pawn in the hands of enemies of the United States -- with tragic results.<br />In this novel, we say &quot;good-bye&quot; to many of the characters we have come to know and love from the previous four novels -- quite a few in a violent fashion.<br />This book is dated -- no question about it -- but the underlying truths expressed by Mr. Drury are still valid -- even if the Cold War IS over and the Soviet Union is no more.	2001-12-26

Books	4	5	7	N	N	While not quite as good. . .	. . .as the three novels which preceded it (some of the events are just too predictable) &quot;Preserve and Protect&quot; remains an outstanding novel about the operation of violence in the American political scene.<br />In this, the fourth novel in the &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; series, Allen Drury addresses a less tangible subject than in the first three.  While &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; dealt with the Senate, and &quot;A Shade of Difference&quot; dealt with racism and the United Nations, and &quot;Capable of Honor&quot; dealt with the newsmedia, the theme for &quot;Preserve and Protect&quot; is violence.  The novel picks up just where &quot;Capable of Honor&quot; left off -- and runs non-stop.  The newly renominated President Hudson has been killed -- and Governor Jason and Senator Knox are going toe-to-toe for the new nomination.<br />The ending of this novel is quite surprising, and leads to the last two novels in the series.<br />As with the entire &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; series, there are many familiar characters, a few new faces, and in-depth background behind a few.<br />Again, as with the entire series, this book should be required reading in high-school civics.	2001-12-26

Instead of the deaths of Sen. Knox and Mrs. Jason, it is Gov. Jason and Mrs. Knox who are killed -- and Senator Knox which ascends to the White House.<br />As the readers of the previous five novels can probably guess, the Presidency of Orrin Knox is far more successful than the Presidency of Edwin Jason.  As an interesting aside, Drury foresaw the possibility of a theatre-level war between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to be more likely than either nation actually attacking the United States.  Although the Soviet Union no longer exists -- I suspect that the same would hold true today.<br />This book brings to a close the six-novel &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; series.  Like the other books in the series, it should be required reading in high-school civics.	2001-12-26
1743569:US	50038433	R2QIYX89LMBBPY	0345303067	940144736	2010: Odyssey Two	Books	4	0	2	N	N	Almost as good as 2001	It is rare that a sequel is accorded as much credit as the first book in a series.  This book is one of those rare events.  Like my review for 2001, I do not choose to re-hash the plot or repeat what other reviewers have said.  I just want to add a few thoughts.<br />1) The focus of 2001 was Saturn -- a focus which did not survive even into the movie.  2010 is more of a sequel to the movie than to the novel.<br />2) The character focus is shifted to Dr. Heywood Floyd -- an important but relatively minor character in the first book, but essential in making this book &quot;work&quot;.  The side-plot which concerns the effect a multi-year space voyage has on his marriage demonstrates a real problem which will have to be addressed when such extended space travel become possible.<br />3) Like in 2001, it is interesting to see the &quot;Cold War&quot; politics from a distance of several decades.  Things sure turned out differently than Dr. Clarke expected, didn't they?!<br />4) Several &quot;loose ends&quot; are tied up in such a manner as to give the reader a view into the development of David Bowman from &quot;childhood&quot; to some level of maturity -- as well as the discussing the emotional needs of someone who has suddenly found himself to be (more or less) immortal.<br />5) Again, Clarke's &quot;theology&quot; comes through -- even more developed than in 2001.  It is a theology based entirely on secular humanism and the evolution of Mind -- if necessary, to the exclusion of all else.  But like the previous book, hints of transcendence still manage to shine through -- a terrifying notion for the true humanist!  One begins to wonder if Clarke is trying to convince himself as well as the reader!<br />Regardless, an excellent read and a good follow-up.	2001-12-06

This reviewer has to agree.<br />From a beginning 10 million years in the past, to the &quot;creation&quot; of whatever it is that David Bowman becomes, 2001: A Space Odyssey grips the reader and doesn't let go.<br />Much has been said about this book; and I'm not going to re-hash what other reviewers have written.  I just wanted to add a few thoughts:<br />1) In the third novel in this series &quot;2061: Odyssey 3&quot; Clarke admits what became evident in the second book (and in the original movie).  There are significant differences between the book and the movie, most importantly, the replacement of Jupiter for Saturn as the destination of &quot;Discovery&quot;.  While Saturn's moon Iaptus was a more &quot;believable&quot; destination (and location for the Monolith) the story could not have been sustained over several novels.<br />2) From a perspective of 35 years later, it is interesting to see Clarke's perspective of the &quot;Cold War&quot; and how it would affect man in space.<br />3) Clarke's theology is present in this book -- and only becomes more clear throughout the subsequent volumes.  It is an utterly humanistic theology centered on the evolution of mind.  Nevertheless, there remains still hints of the transcendent (also visible in several of Clarke's other novels) which clearly disturb the otherwise cold rationality of his thought.	2001-12-06

He as gone far to try to make the story as accurate and honest as possible.  For this, he should be commended.  And frankly, the book was just plain fun to read, especially for someone (like myself) who is a staunch supporter of the space program.<br />However, I was put off by Wolfe's casual writing style.  Yes, it's a personal beef -- but this is a personal review, and I just didn't resonate with him stylistically!  More serious, though, to my mind, was what the book 'did' -- and that is, to seriously deconstruct a myth.  The men (and their families) depicted in the book, were (and to a certain extent, still are) heros in the minds of many Americans -- in a time when American badly needed heros.  And to my mind, Wolfe trimmed those heros down to size.  I'm not convinced that this was necessary -- or a good idea.<br />No, I'm not naive.  I realize that ALL heros have feet of clay.  I'm just not sure that it is appropriate -- or healthy -- to exploit that clay.	2001-11-21

I don't know what it is, but in this series, it seems that a weak title follows a strong one.  Just like &quot;Bearing an Hourglass&quot; didn't come up to the level of &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot;, so &quot;Wielding a Red Sword&quot; does not come up to the level of &quot;With a Tangled Skein&quot;.<br />The basic premise of this novel seems more concerned with finding a permenant love interest for the main character than it does with exploring the role/nature of the Incarnation of War.  Also expanded upon are the concepts of the &quot;lesser incarnations&quot;; a plot device which is (probably) necessary to explain the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; which traditionally accompany War, but introduces a weakness in the integrity of the series as a whole.<br />Two interesting conventions are either exapanded upon or introduced.  The first is the &quot;tying together&quot; of the various characters, hinted at in the first couple of books, but emphasized strongly in this volume.  Now we know some of what happened to Orb, introduced in the previous volume as the daughter of Niobe.  It certainly appears that Anthony intends to unite all the Incarnations in one family (or love) realationship.  The other is the idea of an Incarnation defeating Satan by threatening to bring down the entire world.  In the previous three novels, the title character's showdown with Satan never approached this level.<br />I enjoyed this book -- and enjoy this series -- but this is one of the weaker titles.	2001-11-12

Like the previous four volumes in this series, &quot;Being a Green Mother&quot; deals with a human taking on the role of an Incarnation.  While the plot of this novel becomes fairly predictible, the characters are interesting.  Anthony's imagination certainly comes to the fore in this novel, incorporating, Jonah the Whale, Jezebel and the band that played in &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot;<br />Again, like the previous novel, it appears that Anthony intends to unite all the Incarnations together by family or relationship ties.  Orb, the daughter of Niobe, is revealed as the mother of Orlene (fathered by Mym) who becomes the lover of Chronos.  (I did find the resolution of the relationship between Mym and Orb to be unconvincing.)<br />Again, like the previous novel, the final showdown between the title character and Satan approaches the level of total destruction -- something not seen in the first three novels.  It also becomes clear that more novels will be required -- the ending is a SERIOUS cliff-hanger!  (If not entirely believable!)<br />An enjoyable entry in this series.	2001-11-12

However, he is just plain wrong!<br />Don't get me wrong, I have a tremendous respect for Peter Marshall as a person.  However, as with my reviews of his previous two books in this series, I find many flaws.<br />Item:  (And this is technically not a flaw)  The authors, in order to move the flow of the book along, do so by means of dialogue.  This DOES have the advantage of making history come alive -- but the reader has to be alert that not all of the dialogue is historical, but rather based on what is known of the characters.  This is especially important for homeschooling parents (and I am one) so their children will understand the difference.<br />Item:  The authors tend to view American history filtered through their Calvinist theology.  Unfortunately, if one is not using a Calvinist lens, their conclusions are far less convincing.  It is quite true that many, many religious Americans in the 18th and 19th century WERE Calvinists; and it is equally true that many aspects of American civilization were highly influenced by Calvinist thought -- but there were other major influences as well, and these tend to be minimized.  With Calvinists no longer having nearly the prominent influence in American society as they did 150 years ago, the average reader will have difficulty making the paradigm shift necessary to fully understand the author's perspective.<br />Item:  One element which was NOT covered in this volume concerns the hideous persecution of Catholics in the United States -- by Calvinists, especially in the North.  The ideas of religious freedom which were part of the founding documents in our land were seriously compromised during the time period under consideration.  It is one thing to exercise one's right to criticize another belief system -- but many, MANY Calvinist clergy of that era crossed the line into outright hate-speech and deceit.  (The Beechers, for example).  In fact, the American Party (otherwise known as the &quot;No-Nothing&quot; Party) was a hotbed of anti-Catholic, anti-immigration American nativism.<br />Item:  This is the most serious.  The authors devote virtually all of the discussion of the causes of the Civil War to the single issue of slavery.  That is just not historically accurate.  (And I'm a conservative northerner!)  While slavery was AN issue, and certainly a &quot;hot button&quot; issue, it was BY NO MEANS the ONLY issue -- or even the FIRST issue.  The most significant issue concerned state's rights and the balance of power between the several states and the federal government.  Another issue was one of economics, and the radically different economic views held by the North as opposed to the South.  To play up the issue of slavery as THE issue just doesn't fly.<br />Item:  The issue of Lincoln's attitude toward slavery is problematic.  Yes, Lincoln was opposed to slavery.  Yes, he was opposed to the expansion of slavery.  However, his NUMBER ONE CONCERN, as is evidenced in his own writings, was the preservation of an intact Union, REGARDLESS of how the slavery issue turned out.  This can easily be verified merely by reading the various citations on the first floor of the Lincoln Memorial.<br />So there it is:  This is one conservative, northerner, Christian clergyman, homeschooling father who does NOT recommend this book as a primary text -- and frankly, I'm undecided on its value even as a secondary text.	2001-11-09

Also included is a discussion of the judgement of the Valar concerning the remarriage of Finwe of the Noldor.<br />Throughout, the volume demonstrates that Tolkien wished to truly create a complete culture, not merely a history.<br />A worthy addition to this series.	2001-11-07

Like the previous volume, the stage is set rather well in the opening chapters.  Unlike the previous volume, the novel continues well!  Of particular note:  the relationship of the three women who share the single body of Fate; the recognized voluntary &quot;temporariness&quot; of their several assignments; the role that Fate has to play with relation to Free-Will (a concept Anthony seems to accept); and (on a rather humorous note) the visit of Fate and Nature to a temporary &quot;hell&quot; constructed for the sole purpose of convincing humanity that hell is, after all, a pretty nifty place.  (The women were not fooled!)<br />The greatest weakness?  The final battle between Fate and Satan.  Totally unconvincing, even for fantasy.<br />Nevertheless, like &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot;, this novel should be read by seminary students to give them fresh perspectives on the difficult questions which people ask in times of crisis.<br />An outstanding read.	2001-10-19

And this first volume &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot;, dealing with the character of Death, is arguably the best in the series.<br />Below the surface of a brilliantly conceived fantasy novel, Anthony asks serious questions about good, evil, heaven, hell, and the role free-will plays in our lives.  He does not, however, provide answers.  The depiction of this fantasy universe is seemingly dualistic in nature.  Will good win?<br />Believe it or not, this novel should be required reading in seminary -- because every minister, regardless of denomination, will be faced with trying to provide reasonable answers to difficult questions.  Again, while this novel (and those that follow) do NOT provide the answers, they nevertheless frame the questions in unique manners.  The reader will certainly gain a new perspective.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-10-19

While the introductory couple of chapters set the stage rather well, the remainder of the novel fails in its promise.  Norton, in his role as Chronos, traveling backward and forward through time, encounters numerous attempts to dissuade him in his purpose -- to fight against Satan and the forces of evil.<br />However, the &quot;encounters&quot; don't seem realistic (even for a fantasy novel).  The freshness of the first novel is almost totally absent, as is the depth of character development.<br />When I first read this volume some 8-10 years ago, I found it one of the weaker efforts of the series.  A recent re-reading has not disabused me of this notion.<br />Worth a read as part of the series -- but standing alone, it is a grave disappointment.	2001-10-19

With a Short Discourse on Hell	Books	5	58	62	N	N	One of the more controversial titles. . .	. . .by the late Catholic theologian Fr. Hans Urs von Balthasar -- but arguably one of the most important.  <br />Critics have unfairly suggested that Fr. von Balthasar is either denying the existence of a literal hell, or denying that anyone is/has been/will be located there.  These critics miss the point entirely.<br />My (extremely brief) summary of Fr. von Balthasar's argument does not concern the existence of hell but rather of the duty of the Christian, which is to fervently pray and hope that all men ARE eventually saved; that the love of Christ CAN eventually reach and be accepted by all; and that knowing through Holy Writ that some will NOT be saved and will choose against God does not free the Christian from the duty of praying for such persons.<br />In today's troubling times, von Balthasar's message is of timeless importance.  To dare to hope and to dare to pray that the love of God will melt the heart of even the most heinous of sinners is a difficult duty.  Indeed, such a reminder is liable to make many people angry.  But it is, nevertheless, a reminder which needs to be made.<br />This book is less technical than much of von Balthasar's work, and thus should be much more widely accessible to the informed layman.	2001-10-16

But then again, the same can be said, not only for Crichton's other novels but for other authors in similar genres -- and for me, at least, that is not a feature worth panning the book for.<br />The premise and development of the novel is what impressed me -- the ideas surrounding the concept of a quantum computer, parallel universes, the concept of the multiverse (borrowed from Heinlein?)etc., and set in a medieval world -- a world which our own time finds quite fascinating. I also found the characters believable.  They were real people with real problems and flaws -- and were able to overcome those flaws in a satisfactory manner.<br />One reviewer complained about the violence and brutality in the depictions of medieval society.  Unfortunately, however, as any historian can attest, such depictions were all too accurate -- and not necessarily reflective of medieval society, but rather of human nature.<br />I heartily recommend this book.	2001-09-18

In his earnest desire to root out paganism in the Body of Christ, he took extremely seriously the work of the late Alexander Hislop &quot;The Two Babylons&quot;.  Mr. Woodrow took this work so seriously that he wrote his own work &quot;Babylon Mystery Religion&quot;.  Being that Mr. Woodrow is a 20th century American, rather than a 19th century Englishman, many American readers found his work more accessible than Rev. Hislop's.<br />Then, something happened.  Mr. Woodrow discovered, through a long process of prayer and historical research, that Rev. Hislop's book was inaccurate -- inaccurate to the point of being fraudulant.  Mr. Woodrow COULD have taken the easy way out.  After all, anti-Catholic books sell like hotcakes in certain sectors.<br />But Mr. Woodrow has the true integrity of a Christian gentleman.  When he discovered -- beyond a shadow of a doubt -- that the information in his earlier work was incorrect, he withdrew that book from publication (at some personal expense) and wrote this volume to explain the whys and wherefores.<br />The result was predictable.  Many of Mr. Woodrow's &quot;friends&quot; turned on him.  (Just take a look at the tenor of some of the other reviews, and you'll see what I mean!)  But other Christians, recognizing integrity in a man (whom they still disagree with on other issues -- like myself) choose to give credit where credit is due.<br />Now I am not a Roman Catholic -- and never have been.  But as a trained historian, I have been shocked and saddened at much of what purports to be research directed against the Catholic Church.  I'm glad to see one man willing to say &quot;I was wrong&quot;.<br />God bless you, Mr. Woodrow.  May you increase in faith and godly wisdom.	2001-08-31

I'm as familiar with the story as any, and more familiar than most. Recently, I had the opportunity to read Sir John Barrow's account of the mutiny and its aftermath and found the book an extremely interesting historical read. Sir John wrote his book at a time when many of the participants were still living. He addresses every major controversy surrounding the mutiny and subsequent adventures and his perspective, while a bit preachy and moralistic at times, is invaluable. While utterly condemning the actions of Fletcher Christian (and blaming the mutiny entirely on him) Barrow is also hard on Captain Bligh, showing him to be an excellent seaman but a poor leader of men (under everyday circumstances). In a crisis, Bligh was able to rise to the occasion (the open sea voyage in the Bounty's launch) but as an everyday commander of men, Bligh was found wanting. Barrow also casts doubt on Bligh's integrity during the trial, suggesting that he deliberately withheld information which could have led to the acquittal of a midshipman against whom he bore an unjustified grudge. Barrow also condemns the behavior of the captain of the Pandora as inhumane (as it was without doubt) and unreasonable, especially to those who were not mutineers, but voluntarily surrendered. Barrow's description of the trial is extremely detailed. He goes to great lengths to demonstrate that in spite of appearances, the guilty were punished and those who were truly innocent were acquitted (or eventually exonerated). He also had an interest in the eternal souls of the mutineers, recording with satisfaction that the three men eventually hanged for the crime showed evidence of repentance and contrition. All in all, this book was a fascinating read, and provided a different perspective than the 20th century movies and popular novels. I hope it comes back into print.	2001-08-24

Hislop was not a credible historical source (to say the least).<br />It takes a pretty big person to admit that they were wrong -- especially when such an admission bears with it significant financial consequences.<br />As for the content?  Mr. Woodrow was right to withdraw it.  The only persons for whom this book would hold an interest would be those already inclined to hate the Catholic Church.  Any reasonable scholar or pastor -- Catholic OR Protestant -- can easily ascertain the truth of the matter.<br />Theological disagreement is one thing -- falsehoods and hate-speech is something else entirely.  Mr. Woodrow wrote this book believing that it was an exercise in the former -- and when exposed as an exercise in the latter, acted the part of the Christian gentleman.	2001-08-01

Many will find it downright uncomfortable.  This is probably a good thing!<br />Mr. Stott, in this heartfelt book, has demonstrated just how far we in America have fallen -- not merely since the days of the American Revolution, but in the last 30 years.<br />His political philosophy could best be described as &quot;Libertarian&quot;, though he does not seem to adhere to all the tenents officially espoused by that party.  Nevertheless, the libertarian (or even the honest conservative, Republican or otherwise) will find in these pages much with which they can resonate.<br />Although I am a passionate conservative, my own political affiliation is Independant -- a decision made upon my ordination, because I saw the need to be able to speak truth where and as I saw it, regardless of offense to a &quot;party line&quot; and without worshiping at the altar of &quot;political correctness&quot;.  As my own emphases as a clergyman are different than Mr. Stott's, there were a few areas in which I did not find myself in full agreement.  This, however, is OK.  As CS Lewis stated, there are certain issues in which honest men may reasonably disagree.  (Of course, this presupposes two important modifiers -- &quot;honest&quot; and &quot;reasonably&quot;!)<br />Whether or not the reader agrees with the answers Mr. Stott provides, he very courageously ASKS THE NEEDED QUESTIONS!  Right now, most of America ISN'T EVEN ASKING THE QUESTIONS, much less providing cogent responses.<br />I would encourage any truly patriotic American to read this book, and think deeply, not only on the solutions Mr. Stott suggests, but (more importantly) on the questions he asks.  It is only when enough Americans stand up and say &quot;Enough is enough&quot; that these questions will be able to be adressed on any significant scale.<br />Thank you, Mr. Stott, for your courage and patriotism in providing this volume.  May God bless you, sir.	2001-07-30

Regardless of individual need, most Americans could immediately implement enough security measures (with little or no cost) which would reduce their risk substantially.<br />For me, the most useful element of the book was the additional resources provided, whether they be websites, books, etc.  Thus, an individual with particular needs not treated in-depth will have a starting point in his own research.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2001-07-26

It was the educational system who substituted the classical liberalism of the 19th century (and previous) with the &quot;liberalism&quot; now claimed by the Establishment.

Richard McBrien, a well-known dissenter in the Church he serves has, from the perspective of this reviewer, written yet another disappointment.<br />The book purports to be a &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; -- an ever popular genre for many centuries.  However, McBrien uses this book (as he did his previous &quot;Lives of the Popes&quot;) to further his own agenda as a representative of the Catholic far left.<br />In the section devoted to explaining the history of &quot;saints&quot; and the process by which persons are declared &quot;saints&quot; in the Catholic Church, he manages to wave the banner of radical feminism, liberation theology, etc., citing almost exclusively representatives from the far left.  This is his privilege -- but it detracts from the alleged purpose of the book.<br />In the section devoted to working through the Church Year, McBrien includes in his list of saints persons not affiliated with the Catholic Church, and in some cases, persons not affiliated with Christianity at all.  (Mahatma Ghandi?  A good and worthy man, to be sure, but his inclusion (as a Hindu mystic) in a book of Christian saints?)  McBrien also manages to defame the memory of those saints with whom he personally disagrees, the most noteworthy example being St. Pius X.  Further, he repeats the same tired anti-Catholic attacks against Pope Pius XII and his alleged &quot;complicity&quot; and &quot;silence&quot; during the Second World War.<br />I grudgingly gave this book 2 stars because of McBrien's recognition of other religious bodies who have a Calendar of Saints and his inclusion of some of those in his list.  However, he is inconsistent in his mention of these, which I found troubling.  (Either discuss/include all or none).<br />A warning to Catholic readers (and I am not a Roman Catholic):  As previously stated, the book DOES contain biographies of Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran saints -- some of whom would not be considered saints by Catholics.  This book does NOT represent biographical sketches of the saints in the Roman Calendar -- a fact which, considering its Catholic author, should have been made more clear.<br />To summarize, McBrien has taken a familiar religious genre, and used it to further his agitations against his own faith tradition.  To me, not the most honest of approaches.<br />I was quite disappointed with this effort.	2001-06-19

The research is being carried out (fraudulently) under the auspices of the Federal Government.  (As a former civil servant, this was both amusing and frightening.  See my review for &quot;Q-Clearance&quot;.)  The novel chronicles the growing self confidence of Dr. Nolan in his own worth as a person and as a researcher -- and his breaking free of the clutches of evil.  The book does not climax until the very end, and the authors have pulled together the various plot threads quite well.<br />A number of observations:<br />The authors have described the &quot;cult personality&quot; quite well, both in terms of how such a person operates and how intelligent people can get sucked into such a web.<br />The scenario is believable -- which, in and of itself is frightening.  <br />There is a fundamental ethical tension in scientific research (one pointed out repeatedly in the novels of Michael Crighton), and exemplified well in this novel, namely this:  Just because we CAN do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we SHOULD do a thing.  To my mind, this is becoming an increasingly important question.<br />The &quot;love/hate&quot; relationship involving the extremely abusive character Richard with members of his family rang true with me -- and, I suspect, would also ring true with those involved in counseling in such situations.<br />In addition, the authors have succeeded in producing a novel which does not have to rely on titallating sex, mindless violence, and gross profanity to move the plot along.  In this day and age, such a thing is refreshing.<br />The biggest weakness in my opinion?  The reliance on the &quot;fringe supernatural&quot; for certain elements of plot resolution.  Not believable, not necessary, and certainly not integral to the plot.<br />All in all, I enjoyed this book.  I hope that the authors produce more novels in this genre.	2001-06-14

Every once in a while, read something which you would normally not read.  Pick up something in a genre you rarely explore.  Sometimes, you will be absolutely delighted.<br />Recently, I did just that.  I picked up a copy of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; -- and thoroughly enjoyed it!  (Far more than I thought that I would!)  Until this point, my only real exposure to Jane Austen was with the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.<br />While (as the reader could probably assume) this form of English literature does not represent a genre I typically frequent, I'm certainly not sorry I spent the time.  Austen's writing is laced with dry and subtle humor, applied with the spirit of a very generous nature.  She also had the gift of being able to very perceptively observe the people around her, and those with whom she came into contact.<br />I highly recommend this tale of young love and happy endings to any and all who need a break from the stress and fuss of the 21st century.	2001-06-14

It also represents the best 20th century critical translation of these important medieval manuscripts.<br />I highly recommend this book for fans of Tolkien's writings as an introduction to the exciting world of medieval English literature.	2001-05-18

The story is obstensibly set in Britain of 1300 years ago, but comes replete with delightful (and deliberate) anachronisims which only add humor to the story.<br />&quot;Smith of Wooten Major&quot; is a story of a different sort entirely.  It represents one of the last pieces of writing produced in final form by the Master, and unlike most of Tolkien's writing, has the feel of allegory to it.  (Yes, I know that Tolkien despised allegory, preferring the term applicability.  Perhaps analogy would be more appropriate here -- let the reader understand.)  Regardless, the story represents the heart of the Master and his love for the world of Faerie.  I fear to describe the story more deeply, lest its spell be broken.<br />Anyhow, this little volume is a &quot;must-read&quot; for any true lover of Tolkien -- and for all travellers in the realm of Faerie.	2001-05-18

I'm a clergyman and an academic -- not a financial planner, etc.  However, like everyone else, I want to be able to retire comfortably, provide for my children, etc.<br />What this book does is demonstrate, by use of example, case study, and extensive research, the qualities which are necessary to obtain and hold wealth -- and these qualities dovetail neatly with many of the same qualities that, as a minister, I try to instill in my congregation. (Not for the purpose of obtaining wealth, but for the purpose of making better people)<br />Although not a religious book in any sense (the authors are not out to make religious or moral judgements) I found it interesting that the keys to achieving wealth included a commitment to marriage, family, a moderate lifestyle, hard work, education etc.<br />The authors have provided a wonderful service in scientifically demonstrating the very virtues our grandfathers would have considered basic common sense -- but that our generation (and I include myself here) seem to have largely forgotten.	2001-05-18

Fr. Edward J. Kilmartin, SJ died before this, his magnum opus was complete.  His notes were left on his computer, and one of his students provided the final editing and publishing work.<br />This results in a text which is extremely detailed in places, and extremely sketchy in others, apparently where Fr. Kilmartin was unable to &quot;flesh out&quot; the material.  Some chapters were complete -- some were more outlines.<br />Nevertheless, this book is a wonderful discussion of both the history and the theology of the Eucharist throughout the course of Western Christian history.  The medieval Eucharistic controversies are covered in detail, as are the issues surrounding the Eucharistic questions at the time of the Reformation and the Council of Trent.<br />Kilmartin is noteworthy here for his insistance that the task of the Church in the Third Millenium is to provide a theology of the Eucharist which is theologically sound, biblical, historic, and at the same time meaningful and relevant.<br />While not necessarily agreeing with every point and emphasis, nevertheless, I highly recommend this book.  It represents a clarion call to authentic thought scholarship -- and to the translation of such thought scholarship to the level of the man in the pew.	2001-05-15

While I would never rely on them all by themselves, I have used them, in addition to non-Calvinist Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish texts in my own exegetical work.<br />Calvin was the first truly great scholar of the Reformation (and hence, of Protestant Christianity).  He knew the Scriptures.  He knew Church History.  He exegeted and systematized and defended and justified and did so in a manner which made Protestantism, especially Reform Protestantism, a sensible and acceptable alternative to Catholic Christianity.  In effect, unlike Luther who tried to reform the established Church itself, Calvin set up a new church to replace the old.  (I personally don't think this was such a good thing. . .)<br />Again, while disagreeing with many of Calvin's conclusions, I do not, and cannot deny the breadth of his scholarship, and hence, its enduring usefulness.	2001-05-08

I made this decision upon my ordination so I could speak freely on various issues without the accusation that I was parroting a party line.  In the course of my ministry, I have had cause to criticize particular policies and particular individuals in both major parties -- and intend that this will contine.<br />I make this disclaimer, because of the vitriol seen in some of the other reviews in this book.  It suggests to me that many Americans really don't understand &quot;how&quot; our system of government is supposed to operate.<br />If a tithe of what Mr. Sammon suggests is correct (and he is a trained journalist, employed by one of the larger US newspapers) the Democratic party in general, and Mr. Gore and Senator Lieberman should be ashamed of themselves.  If much more than 10 percent is true, both these men should permenantly driven from public office.  (And this comes from someone who USED to respect Senator Lieberman, even when I disagreed with him)<br />It has been demonstrated over and over in the public record that a deliberate attempt was made to disenfranchise military ballots using technicalities and loopholes.  This is not an opinion -- it is a fact which has been repeatedly demonstrated.<br />Likewise, it is a fact that the major news outlets announced Gore for Florida prior to the closing of the polls in a densely Republican area.  I remember several elections ago, when the media was criticized for announcing a winner when polls were still open in other parts of the country.  Now, winners are being announced without the polls even being closed in the state in question!<br />Finally, it is clear to me that the recount procedures in Florida could not possibly have been handled any worse.  The state does need to clean up its act, and I don't believe that either party disputes this!  But during the recount process, the Gore team utilized a pattern of character defamation, and a policy of &quot;loudly accuse your opponant of thevery thing you yourself are doing&quot; -- and almost succeeded.<br />I cast my vote for Mr. Bush as someone I saw as the lesser of two poor choices.  I'll freely admit this.  However, after seeing Mr. Gore's behavior during the recount process, I'm glad I did so.  Apparently, there are Gore supporters who feel the same way I do.<br />The most important lesson to be drawn from this book -- and from the 2000 election cycle -- is that the integrity of the &quot;process&quot; is ultimately far more important than a particular candidate.  Our country has had good presidents, bad presidents, and many in the middle.  And it is our opportunity, as Americans, to be able to change our nation's political direction each election year.<br />This book demonstrates that what was ultimately at stake during this election debacle was not whether Bush or Gore was the rightful winner.  Rather, the ultimate stakes involved the integrity of the system itself -- and the exposure of a man and a party who was willing to stop at nothing -- even to the destruction of our political system itself -- to win an election.<br />A look at history will show that over the years, all major parties have contributed to political scandal.  This cannot be denied.  I have no interest in tarring all Democrats with Gore's brush, any more than I would tar all Republicans with Nixon's brush, etc. But in this particular case, the blame for the disaster which very nearly ensued, falls squarely on the shoulders of one person, and his party leaders.<br />The good news (and again, this has nothing to do with parties in general, but rather this particular instance) is that the system ultimately prevailed.<br />I hope and pray that nothing of this sort happens again.  It might well be the death-knell for our nation.	2001-05-08

I could go on and on -- but I think you understand my point.  I have always loved Astronomy.<br />This wonderful book should be back in print.  It is a readable (and beautiful) college-level introduction to the basic ideas, concepts, and history of this fascinating science.

Most of us will have occasion to attend services in houses of worship other than our own.  This book is a guide on proper behavior under these circumstances.<br />As a Christian clergyman, I have personally have had occasion to attend service in almost every major American Christian denomination, as well as Jewish temple services.  Most members of the clergy that I know are in similar positions.  All of us are passionate about our own faith -- but none of us want to be accidentally offensive to others.<br />Some might ask, &quot;Why should I be concerned about how to behave at someone else's religious service?  I never expect to go.  They don't worship the way I do.  They don't believe in the same God that I believe in, etc.&quot;  For persons with these attitudes, here are some points to consider:<br />1)  You may be surprised at the type of service you find yourself.  A wedding.  A funeral.  A christening.  A Bar-Mitzpah.  The list goes on.  <br />2)  There are certain situations in which NOT attending can cause MORE offense.<br />3)  Put yourself in the shoes of another.  Would you want your Jewish or Muslim co-worker to support YOU if YOU lost a loved one?<br />4)  Showing respect to another, WITHOUT compromising your own beliefs is an excellent way to share your own faith.<br />The list goes on.<br />This book does not suggest in any way that anyone compromise their own beliefs.  It does not attempt to convert or sway anyone to a different way of thinking.  What it DOES do, and does very well, is provide, to an increasingly discourteous society, the minimal rules of courtesy that persons today are no longer routinely taught.<br />Courtesy is the oil that lubricates all social interactions.  This book helps provide this service.	2001-05-03

He is an angry ex-priest who does not believe the most very basic tenants of the faith. <br />He has invented a thesis and then re-interpreted 2000 years of history through the lenses of his invented thesis.  <br />He has dismissed any and all primary sources who would disagree with his thesis.<br />He has ignored the available historical resources.<br />In so doing, he has, in the opinion of this reviewer,  actually done HARM to the crusade against anti-semitism.  Anti-semitism is a serious problem in society -- and has been for thousands of years (in fact, for thousands of years PRIOR to the emergence of Christianity).  In order to understand and combat anti-semitism, the true facts of the matter must be presented and understood. <br />Carroll's oversimplistic, anti-Catholic, anti-Christian hand-wringing does little to further the cause of authentically presenting and understanding and combatting the very real evil of anti-semitism in society.	2001-04-27

Named after the premier Scripture scholar of the Patristic period, it is an update of the Jerome Biblical Commentary of more than a quarter century ago.  <br />Not only is every book of the Bible discussed in detail, there are numerous scholarly articles dealing with history, critical methods, contemporary issues and the like.  It's perspective is honestly centrist; catering to neither the fundamentalist, nor to the deconstructionist.  Controversial issues are handled in an appropriate manner, giving numerous bibliographic citations representing a wide range of learned opinions.<br />Although Catholic in orientation, the book is equally valuable to believers from other faith traditions, and indeed, to non-believers as well.  Its editors, especially the late Raymond Brown and Joseph Fitzmyer represent the very best of Catholic critical scholarship.<br />This book is probably not the best choice for the average layman; it presupposes a certain familiarity with theological academics.  However, it is indispensible for the seminarian, the graduate student, the clergy, and the academic.<br />(For an &quot;informed layman's&quot; version, please see my review of the excellent &quot;New Jerome Biblical HANDBOOK&quot;).<br />I heartily endorse this book.	2001-04-27

Thus, while too much effort is spent, in my opinion, on a minority view within Protestantism, the presentation is historical, rather than doctrinal.

The book provides an extremely valuable introduction to the concepts involved in Christian Ethics and Moral Theology.  Moral implications of numerous current issues are discussed and analyzed in detail.  Much positive supporting documentation is provided, as are numerous scholarly footnotes and references.<br />However, in the opinion of this reviewer, there is a flaw so serious in this book that I cannot, in good conscience recommend it as a seminary text, nor would I use it myself as a primary source.<br />Dr. Hays is a pacifist.  By itself, this is no problem.  Many, many Christians world-wide are pacifist and have been since the dawn of Christianity.  However, Dr. Hays uses his pacifism to filter virtually every issue presented in this book, regardless of relevance.  His view of Christian pacifism represents an extreme which cannot be justified by any careful examination of Church history.  Yet he presents this issue as the &quot;be all and end all&quot; foremost issue facing the Church in the world today.  <br />My negative review is not based so much on my disagreement with Dr. Hays on this issue as it is with the pervasiveness with which he allows his view on this single issue to color the entire book.<br />I am also dismayed by the single exception Dr. Hays makes in his anti-violence crusade.  This is the issue of abortion.  For someone whose pacifistic views color his understanding of all other moral issues, his complete retreat on the area of abortion (which, until the mid-20th century, was an issue of complete consensus in Christianity) seems to me to be hypocritical.<br />The scholar can safely use this book as a secondary source.  But I'll never teach from it.	2001-04-24

Dr. House, while obviously an evangelical, bordering on being a fundamentalist, is sound and even-handed when dealing with various differences in timetables, chronologies, opinions, etc. about New Testament history and doctrine.<br />There is a little big of Protestant &quot;digging&quot; against Catholic understandings of New Testament doctrines etc., but nothing too objectionable.<br />This would be a good book for the &quot;informed layman&quot; or for a church library.

A sense of humor is desperately necessary in life, and Frank Foglio certainly shows that he is capable in that area.<br />BUT the story he relates with such humor is a sad one.  It is the story of an Italian-American family, not at all well-versed in their Catholic faith, who are essentially hoodwinked by the &quot;witness&quot; of another Italian-American family who were equally not at all well-versed in either the faith they rejected, or the Pentecostalism they accepted.  Toss in an unhealthy dose of bad theology (for example, rejection of Mary as &quot;theotokos&quot; -- a doctrine accepted not only by Catholics, but Orthodox and most Protestants alike) and you've got a recipie for disaster.<br />From a violently abusive father, to a &quot;heavenly hand&quot; which slaps cigars out of people's mouths, to the &quot;miracle&quot; of being able to drive a car for 17 miles with the fuel gauge on &quot;E&quot;, this book relates how, one at a time, an entire family lost their spiritual moorings for something far more shallow.<br />This points to several needs:<br />1)  Better catechesis in the Catholic Church, so people aren't fooled.<br />2)  Better theological understanding among Pentecostals, so that open and blatant heresy is avoided.<br />3)  Better understanding between the two theological groups so that this sort of thing does not occur and does not NEED to occur.<br />As a member of the Society for Pentecostal Studies, an academic group committed to legitimate theological growth and discussion between Pentecostals and members of other Christian bodies, this book should be held up as a classic example of what ALL Christians should want to avoid.<br />Again, a very sad tale.  One can only hope that the Foglio family comes to the realization of what they left, and what they entered.	2001-04-20

White book, (The King James Only Controversy) I'm not particularly a fan of his, but was perfectly willing, as a brother in Christ, to give credit where credit was due.<br />Whatever successes White enjoyed in &quot;KJV Only&quot; do not carry over to this book.<br />It is true that White has debated many top Catholic apologists all over the US.  And these Catholic apologists use these debates (and sell tapes of these debates) to demonstrate the weaknesses of the Reformed theological tradition in general -- and White's appropriation of that tradition in particular!  NOT something for White to brag about!<br />Many, many years ago, I found myself (and I'm not a Roman Catholic) in an on-line debate with Dr. White over a number of patristic issues.  The difficulty with his scholarship is his eisegis -- his tendency to filter texts, whether Patristic, or biblical, or Reformation, etc., through the glasses of his rather  extreme form of Reform (Calvinistic) Christianity, rather than to examine the texts for what they actually said.<br />That's just not good scholarship, regardless of whether one is Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, or not even a believer.<br />The more extreme branches of American Calvinism have come under a great deal of fire in recent decades, because of their apparent willingness to judge the Catholic Church through the eyes of their own caricatures -- rather than by what that body actually believes.<br />This book is further evidence of that tendency.	2001-04-19

I am a conservative Christian clergyman.  I have a profound respect for the Bible as the inspired word of God.  I am a professional theologian, with a keen layman's interest in science, which goes back to my early elementary school days.<br />This book is neither credible science nor credible theology.  It presents an extremely narrow view of biblical studies, and rejects any other possible explanation or interpretation.  Any honest biblical scholar will immediately see that Morris engages in questionable eisegesis -- reading into the text what one already believes -- rather than scholarly exegesis -- reading the text as it is written, and then (and only then) drawing conclusions.<br />It's also difficult to engage this book in a scientific fashion.  Dr. Morris's own credibility as a scholar and researcher is lacking; and some of his conclusions fly in the face of known scientific fact (and I'm NOT talking here about evolution).  <br />What also concerns me is the testimony from scientists formerly involved with Morris' Institute for Creation Research who, while still believing in God, the Bible, and the truth of the Christian message, have gone on record flatly contradicting the value and validity of Morris's &quot;science&quot;.<br />Any Christian, regardless of denomination, believes that God is the Ultimate Source of all that is.  But that doesn't mean that the Scriptures are a scientific treatise.<br />Dr. Morris would be wise to take a page from Augustine of Hippo.  This saint of the Church, revered by Catholics and Protestants alike, gave the wise advice that Christians should avoid relying on individualistic ultra-literal personal interpretations of Scripture which fly in the face of known fact, because to do so brings ridicule and scandal to the faith.<br />I've read too many testimonies of persons who have either left the faith, or who have had undergone major crises of conscience because of Dr. Morris's &quot;theories&quot; to be able to support his efforts.	2001-04-10

Andrew M. Greeley quite enjoyable.<br />As stated in other reviews, there are elements of Fr. Greeley's theological viewpoint in which I find myself in sharp disagreement.  But there is no doubt that he is an outstanding storyteller.<br />In this book, Greeley ventures into the realm of Science Fiction with the introduction of the amazing character of Dr. Gabriella Light, PhD. -- the angel Gabriel, no less -- as a personal guide for the lapsed Dr. Sean Desmond on his trip to Sweden to pick up the Nobel Prize.  It seems that terrorists are after Dr. Desmond because of the potential implications of his scientific discoveries.<br />Fr. Greeley's style is not for everybody.  He dabbles a little to far into the erotic than might be considered strictly appropriate for a celibate clergyman.  His incorporation of his criticisms of modern Catholicism into his books can serve as a turn-off.<br />BUT, Fr. Greeley is a great storyteller in the old Irish tradition.  His imagination is incredible.  And his fundamental faith in the goodness and grace of God is inescapable.<br />For me, this is one of his best offerings.	2001-04-10

This is the book which, upon its completion, convinced John Henry Newman that he needed to make his submission to the Catholic Church.<br />This painstakingly researched book describes the historical process by which doctrine develops in the Church.  It has, in the years since its publication, become the primary text for anyone wishing to study this subject, regardless of their denominational background.<br />Unfortunately, the typical response to this book, by Christians of other denominations, is NOT to actually engage the specific points raised by Newman, but rather to attack Newman's person and character.  This was true while Newman was alive, and remains true to this day.  (The notable exception is Adolph von Harnak, who, while sharply disagreeing with Newman, actually did engage the concept of doctrinal development itself).<br />An interesting historical note:  The Catholic Church was, at first, not particularly sympathetic to this work, as it was not written in Latin, nor in the fashion of Catholic theological works of the day.<br />This edition, with a forward by Ian Ker, is, for me, the preferred volume.  Ker is noted world-wide as being a top Newman scholar - and his scholarship shows in this work.	2001-04-06

While not, by any stretch of the imagination, on the same level as his &quot;Essay&quot;, nevertheless, these writings continue to demonstrate Newman's evolving understanding as to how doctrine develops.<br />Recommended -- along with Ian Ker's edition of &quot;Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine&quot;.	2001-04-06

A brief glance at the editorial reviews praising this book -- reviewers who are drawn from a wide variety of scholars representing a wide variety of theological opinions -- will demonstrate the value of White's book.<br />(As an aside, it is fascinating to note some of the criticisms leveled against White -- accusing him, among other things, of being in league with the Catholics when White is, in fact, a staunch anti-Catholic!)<br />Again, while I find myself profoundly out of sympathy with many of White's opinions, I certainly can't fault him for this excellent work.	2001-04-06

In its pages, he presents, using his concept of a &quot;theological dramatic theory&quot;, his ecclesiology, his Christology, and his Mariology, all of which are intrinsically interconnected.<br />In a review of this sort, it is impossible to fully express the range of what this book covers (much less the totality of von Balthasar's thought).  However, as a bit of a 'teaser', (to encourage the review reader toward the purchase of this book), I'll point out a couple of areas which were of great interest to me.<br />One area of interest was in von Balthasar's discussion of Christology.  Unlike many systematicians who all too often assume that students of systematics already know history (a dangerous assumption, at best), von Balthasar locates his theological discussion of Christology from within the historical controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries.<br />Another area of interest was in his discussion of ecclesiology.  In expounding his theology of &quot;Church&quot;, von Balthasar develops his &quot;Christological Constellation&quot; (further expounded in &quot;The Office of Peter and the Structure of the Church&quot;) based on the New Testament witness of Peter, James, John, Paul and Mary.<br />A third area of interest was in his discussion of Mariology, which he locates (following Vatican II) in his discussion of the Church.  His presentation of Mary is at once theological and pious, without being overbearing.  Of special interest in the Mariological section is his discussion of the role of woman vis a vis the role of man in the Divine Plan.<br />If you only read one volume of von Balthasar's theology, this would probably be the one to read.  I heartily recommend this book.	2001-04-02

McBrien, a popular American theologian with a long history of dissent against the Church he purports to support, has provided in this text a wonderfully, post-modern, late 20th century apologetic for his ideas about what he believes Catholicism should be.  As someone who rejects post-modernism, both philosophically and theologically, I find that the 'religion' he presents is merely a poor shadow of the Christian faith I know and love.  (And I'm not even a Roman Catholic)<br />The text is scholarly, no doubt about it, (I will give credit where credit is due) and is a useful as a reference tool.  (I've had the previous 2 volume edition on my shelves for years)  But I'm concerned that the picture of Catholicism it presents is so heavily weighted in favor of McBrien's pet issues that it obscures the reality of what the Church 'is' and what the Church 'means'.<br />For those who want to understand what the Catholic faith is really about, I would suggest that your time and money is far better spent on the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;.	2001-03-27

Finally, I found the climax to be appropriately dramatic yet believable.<br />However, the book is not without it's flaws.  The finding of Clare by Brian on the ferry seemed to be a forced coincidence to make the story work.  I didn't find it to be particularly effective or believable.  The depth of the emotions between these two characters I also found to be not quite believable.  After all, their relationship was little more than a one-night stand.  Finally (and related to the previous objection) I found the conclusion to be extremely unsatisfying and unbelievable.<br />This book is definitely worth a read.  But it's not going to go down in history as a work of genius.  I can't imagine re-reading it.<br />A solid three stars.	2001-03-24

In &quot;Sauron Defeated&quot;, Christopher Tolkien brings to a close &quot;The History of The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a subset within his &quot;The History of Middle Earth&quot;.  Like the previous three volumes in this series, Christopher traces the development of his father's thought as the final chapters of The Lord of the Rings are written.  Of special interest are the early conceptions of &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; and the two versions of the never-published &quot;Epilogue&quot;.  The Epilogue was, to me, particularly touching, as it involved Sam, now a middle-aged hobbit with a houseful of kids, reading to his family and keeping the Story alive.<br />HOWEVER, the above material, while unable to fit into the previous volume (The War of the Ring), was not enough to warrent a volume all by itself.  So Christopher has also included &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; -- a space/time/dream travel story, written at the same time as The Lord of the Rings was being developed.  The story itself involves Numenor -- Tolkien's telling of the Atlantis saga.  Of particular interest to CS Lewis fans, &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot; purports to be a discussion of (among other things) Lewis' own space travel fiction, penned in the late 30's and early 40's.  It's a shame that this story was never brought to completion -- I'm finding the ideas it expresses to be quite interesting.<br />Again, 5 stars, both for the Master, and for the tireless work of Christopher.	2001-03-14

He is also realizing that loving and being loved by three different women is not as easy as it looks!<br />Mat, long used to playing the role of the cad himself, is finding himself in a situation where the tables are turned!<br />Perrin is devastated by the (apparent) loss of his wife.<br />And the book ends in a very satisfying and dramatic fashion -- which I won't reveal here.<br />Although I'm still of the opinion that Jordan has more loose threads than he can reasonably tie up, this book is such an improvement over the last 2 or 3 that I'm more than willing to re-read -- and eagerly wait for the next installment.<br />However, one thing is clear.  The Tolkien comparisons which flew thick and fast when &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; was first published, came too soon.

Of particular interest in this book:<br />The development of the &quot;Paths of the Dead&quot; story.<br />The development of the character of Denethor, Steward of Gondor.<br />The development of &quot;The Battle of the Pelennor Fields&quot;.<br />The development of the story of Shelob and Frodo's capture.<br />It's unfortunate that Christopher Tolkien was unable to finish &quot;The History of The Lord of the Rings&quot; in three volumes, so the reader is left with the story still unfinished.  It is also worth noting that these books, especially as they proceed to the end of the story, do not simply rehash the final work.  If sections of a chapter underwent little or no evolutionary development, they are treated briefly.  The greatest attention is paid to those episodes which were written and re-written, often in very different ways.<br />I was somewhat disappointed that the theme of Gollum's &quot;near repentance&quot; was not treated in detail, as JRR Tolkien felt that this was a key turning-point in the story.  But again, if an episode underwent little development, Christopher did not spend much time on it.<br />Five stars -- and another &quot;Thank-you&quot; to Christopher for this labor of love on his late father's behalf.	2001-03-06

These books are works of fiction, only loosely based on the life of the Wilder family.  The writing is average, at best, and the purpose of the books seems to be to an advertisment of the author's own series concerning a fictional pioneer widower clergyman and his children.

These two volumes represent the most up-to-date, complete, and academically critical presentations and translations of all the decrees of all 21 Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church.<br />Of particular note is the original language text, given on the left-hand pages, providing the resources for the language scholar to make the translations him/herself.  This is of value, because Fr. Tanner's English translation is a bit &quot;modern&quot;; succumbing unnecessarily to the lure of the &quot;inclusive language translation&quot;.<br />Leaving this aside, the research and scholarship is impeccable.

I am a clergyman and an historian, with a keen interest and background in Church history.

The difference here, is that compared to many other denominations, non-conforming and dissident Catholics are permitted a voice.  If the reader doesn't believe me, try publically dissenting from &quot;official&quot; teaching in a liberal Protestant denomination, or in a Fundamentalist church.<br />There are certainly persons within the Catholic Church who disagree with Church teaching on key issues.  But this volume would have been far more valuable if it had not limited its contributers to the radical fringe.  <br />Sorry -- this isn't the way to properly dissent.  No stars.<br />PS  (Note to previous reviewer Rev. Chet Scalese -- by her own admission, one of the editors is NOT a Roman Catholic.

As I've suggested in a previous review, all those prospective authors out there should &quot;read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest&quot; what Christoper has done in these volumes.  He has provided an in-depth, graduate-level seminar in the process behind writing a novel.  For this reason alone, the book is valuable.<br />But the book's value far exceeds its mere literary merit for those who truly love Middle-Earth.  (Although I disagree with much of what Peter Beagle has written about &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, I can sympathize with his desire to go to Middle-Earth!  I wish I could, as well!<br />This book details the material that eventually became the end of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and the first part of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;.  In it, we see the earliest forms of the visit to Lorien, the fall and repentance of Boromir, and the events leading up to the fall of Isengard (which is related in the next volume).  Of particular interest:<br />Tolkien still struggles with how to portray the Ents.  Originally, Treebeard was Giant Tree Beard -- and an enemy.<br />The numerous illustrations provided throughout the book.  I found particularly interesting the various stages of development that<br />Orthanc underwent.<br />The Appendix on runes.  Apparently, the runic inscription on Balin's tomb in Moria led Tolkien into an elaborate description of runes and their types,  who used what, etc.  Some of this material made it into the Appendix of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; -- but not all of it.<br />Altogether, and enjoyable read.  I fervently wish that more effort was concentrated on Tolkien scholarship than on fandom -- but such is the way ofthe world, I suppose.<br />Five Stars -- and well worth it.	2001-02-01

Either the science is good, or the plot is exciting, or significant issues are discussed, or the characters are well-developed -- but rarely are more than one or two of these elements ever found within the pages of the same book.<br />&quot;The Mote in God's Eye&quot; is a spectacular exception to this trend.  It is a believable &quot;First Contact&quot; story with a reasonable &quot;history&quot;.  The characters are deep and well-developed.  Serious moral and ethical issues are fearlessly tackled.  The plot is exciting -- and the science is plausible.

So as a conservative, Christian clergyman who is neither a Roman Catholic nor an Independant Bible fundamentalist, perhaps I can shed some light on this question.<br />Item: The main point of &quot;Tribulation Force&quot; is not to bash Catholics.<br />Item: Either Mr. LaHaye or Mr. Jenkins (or both) is/are woefully uninformed as to what Catholics believe.<br />Item: Although &quot;Tribulation Force&quot; does not seem to exist solely for the purpose of bashing Catholics, books in this genre have (for decades) typically featured a high-level Catholic clergyman (Pope, bishop, etc.) as representing the &quot;False Prophet&quot; of Revelation -- and this book is no exception.<br />Item: Some extremely basic studying of Catholic doctrine would probably have eliminated several of the more glaring errors made by the authors -- which, presumably caused the greatest level of offense to Catholics.  These would include:<br /> 1) Suggesting that of all the Roman Curia, only the newly elected Pope was &quot;Raptured&quot;, apparently for becoming a theological Lutheran.  Such a supposition is insulting to Catholics, to Lutherans, to historians who are aware of the social and political ramifications of the Reformation era, and to theologians who are aware of what exactly Luther taught and believed, how that differs from Lutheran theology today, and how neither theology fits with the LaHaye/Jenkins ecclesiology.  Essentially, the authors would disagree with classic Lutheran theology as much as they do with Catholic theology.<br />2) The Archbishop of Cincinnati figure, who is obviously destined to be the &quot;FalseProphet&quot; character, suggests that he doesn't take the &quot;Apocrypha&quot; literally.  LaHaye and Jenkins are confusing the &quot;Apocalypse&quot; which is another name for the book of Revelation, with the &quot;Apocrypha&quot;, a Protestant term used to signify certain books which Catholics and Orthodox Christians accept, but that most Protestants reject.<br />3) There seems to be some fundamental misunderstanding by LaHaye/Jenkins about Catholic theology of baptism.<br />4) There seems to be some fundamental misunderstanding by LaHaye/Jenkins about Catholic theology of justification.<br />5) There seems to be a total lack of understanding by LaHaye/Jenkins about how the Catholic hierarchy actually functions; the role of the College of Cardinals; which cities are traditionally Cardinal sees, etc.<br />6) There is a strong suggestion that those Catholics who would be raptured are those who have left the Church.<br />Some further thoughts:<br />Item: Luther, upon whom the salvation of the pope in &quot;Tribulation Force&quot; apparently rested, seriously doubted the inspiration of the book of Revelation.  It is highly doubtful at best that he would subscribe to the eschatology presented by LaHaye/Jenkins.<br />My conclusion:  LaHaye/Jenkins do not seem to have set out to write a deliberately anti-Catholic book. However, their ignorance/misunderstanding of Catholic belief and practice, coupled with certain presuppositions which, unfortunately, are fairly typical of certain elements of American fundamentalism, certainly set forth an atmosphere (unintended or not) which fosters anti-Catholic attitudes and is rooted more in American nativism than in actual theology.  Yes, ignorance can hurt and offend - and as such does not further the unity of the Body of Christ prayed for by Jesus Himself in John's Gospel.<br />No stars for sloppy research and unnecessary offense.	2001-01-16

He does so in a manner which is non-threatening, non-controversial, and non-technical.<br />The book's greatest flaw, in my opinion, is that at times it does not seem techincal enough.

Written 50 years ago, and eerily prophetic, CS Lewis railed against the dumbing down of education in the British school systems, from an academic standpoint, but more importantly, from the standpoint of morality and values.<br />As is evidenced in his other non-fiction (Mere Christianity, for example) Lewis was a believer in the doctrine of Natural Law (held by Catholics and many Protestants).  This doctrine recognizes that since man was created in the image of God, traces of that image still remains.  The Fall of Man severely damaged the image of God in man, but did not totally destroy it.  Thus, throughout human history, integral values systems still maintain cetain laws, customs, beliefs, etc. which cross beyond religious and philosophical boundaries, and are, for the most part, common to all.<br />This is an example of Natural Law at work -- and this is precisely what the secular education structures, both in Lewis' day, and even more so today, wish to utterly destroy, and replace with the nonsensical notion of a society in which there is no foundational morality; no foundational &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;.  Lewis saw it happening half a century ago -- and people did not listen.  The case is even more grave today.  Will people listen today?	2000-12-20

Greenfield's not very well disguised point is that the Electoral College is a bad idea whose time has come and gone, presumably in favor of direct Presidential elections.<br />Mr. Greenfield needs to remember that we live in a Constitutional Republic -- not a pure Democracy -- because the Founding Fathers felt (correctly, in my view) that a pure democracy had the potential to be more tyrannical than a monarchy.  Consider the recent election (or any Presidental election, for that matter).  Eliminate the Electoral College, and New York, Chicago, LA, and a few other major metropolitan areas will choose every President from here on out.  Those of us who don't live on one of the coasts (like myself) will never again see a candidate in person, never hear a live debate, etc.  The population centers will control all.<br />The book is worth reading -- but realize that it's intention is to undermine our nation -- not strengthen it.	2000-12-14

Writing a review about a Robert Heinlein novel is a difficult and daunting task.  His works are enjoyed by a wide variety of people who otherwise have very little in common.  There is plenty in his politics to offend both liberals and conservatives.  His sexual mores were, shall we say, liberated in the extreme.  But coupled with those mores was a passionate devotion to children and the family concept that would give the &quot;free love&quot; crowd great pause.  His works range from classic 1930's era pulp Sci-fi, to the bizarre, to well thought-out political and social commentary, laced with believable science and engineering.<br />&quot;The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress&quot; falls into the third category.  It is a well reasoned, fast paced book about a time in the not all too distant future when the Moon, (like Australia of a couple centuries past) is used as a penal colony.  By the time of the story, there are an abundance of free people on the Moon -- either convicts who have discharged their sentences, or descendents of previous &quot;residents&quot; -- and these people begin a revolt not unlike our own American Revolution.<br />Throughout the novel, Heinlein comments (strongly, at times) on matters of law, justice, social equality, personal responsibility, and sex.<br />I could not put this book down.	2000-12-07

He continued his excellent &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; series with a book that touched upon the overwhelming power of the media to form and force public opinion, and did so in a context (that of a violently divided Presidential nominating convention) which resonates true today.<br />When Mr. Drury was writing, his main fear was the communist threat.  His books need to be read and understood in that context.  However, don't think for a moment that his books are not timely today.  Take a look at the political and journalistic situation surrounding the 2000 Presidential election, and one can easily see how insightful Mr. Drury was.  (20 years in the newspaper business did him some good!)<br />I'm sorry that we have lost Mr. Drury -- I would have enjoyed his take on recent events in the US.	2000-12-05

Nevertheless, the contributions this man made to philosophy and theology in the 20th century cannot be measured.  In &quot;Foundations of Christian Faith&quot;, the reader can gain an understanding of Rahner's beliefs presented in a more or less systematic fashion.  This is refreshing, because most of Rahner's writings are preserved in collections of essays -- very valuable in and of themselves, but not systematic in their presentation.<br />This volume is a systematic presentation.  Rahner begins from a philosophical perspective informed primarily by St. Thomas Aquinas, but filtered through the lens of German idealism.  He begins with discussions on such subjects as Man as Person, Man as Transcendent Being, Questions of Personal Existence, and moves first to God as Absolute Mystery, Guilt, God's Self-Communication, and leads naturally into soteriology, Christology, and ecclesiology.<br />Whether at the end of the day one find's Rahner's arguments convincing (I don't fully) they are nevertheless compelling and should be studied by Protestants as well as Catholics.	2000-12-05

I'm reading the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series on the advice and at the request of a Christian friend who comes from a different theological tradition than myself.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first book, and am looking forward to reading the rest.<br />This having been said, it is important that I make one other point clear.  LaHaye and Jenkins have written a thriller based not on the Bible, but rather on an INTERPRETATION of the Bible --  a distinction which should be clearly noted.  It must also be understood that their interpretation is at best a MINORITY interpretation -- even among conservatives and evangelicals.  The word &quot;Rapture&quot; is never found in Scripture -- and the biblical basis for the doctrine comes from questionable exegesis of a very few verses taken out of context.  The doctrine is not, and never has been, part of the &quot;deposit of faith&quot;.  The theology expressed in the book is completely unknown, not only to Catholic and Orthodox Christians -- but also not accepted by the great Reformers (Luther, Calvin, etc.), nor to the Protestant preachers of the Great Awakening (Whitfield, Wesley, etc.).  <br />The eschatology (theology of the End Times) expressed in this book represents a view known as pre-millenial dispensationalism, specifically a &quot;Pre-tribulation Rapture&quot; version of pre-millenial dispensationalism.  (There are groups which, while holding many of the same beliefs, argue that the Rapure will take place either at the mid-point of the Tribulation, or at the end of the Tribulation). The doctrine originated among religious groups in the mid 19th century -- many of which could only be considered &quot;Christian&quot; in the very loosest sense of the word.  The doctrine was only absorbed by more mainstream Christianity about 100 years ago.<br />Because of the way the book is written, a non-believer, oran uninformed believer could easily make the assumption that the version of events related in &quot;Left Behind&quot; is THE authentic Christian interpretation of Revelation -- and that's just not the case.  LaHaye and Jenkins should have made this clear in an author's forward. That they did not do so, in my opinion, speaks negatively to their integrity.<br />Having said all this by way of disclaimer -- I thorougly enjoyed this book -- as light reading.  I did not find it particularly believable in a theological sense; I thought that character development was, at times, sketchy; I thought that there were too many incredible plot contrivances (for example, the almost &quot;instant conversion&quot; of the four main  characters, the complete absense of any reference to any church other than the &quot;New Hope&quot; church, the instant rise and patent obviousness of the antiChrist figure, etc.).  However, I could not put the book down.  I have always enjoyed religious fiction, and this was no exception.<br />If any readers of this review are interested in &quot;End Times&quot; fiction which is deeper and more substantial, allow me to  recommend Michael O'Brien's &quot;Children of the Last Days&quot; series, all of which I have read and reviewed for Amazon.com.<br />Score 2 1/2 stars, and we'll round up.	2000-12-04

It is also accessible to the informed layman.  The volume is also of potential value to the honest Protestant, seeking to understand the teachings of the Catholic Church.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2000-11-17

As the name implies, &quot;Royal Secrets&quot; was a book that didn't need to be written.  Nothing particularly new or scandalous is revealed (other than the author's poor sense of taste).<br />Whatever good will remained between Barry and the Royal Family after his first book (quite a lot, I expect) certainly could not remain after this one.<br />Very disappointing.

This is a work of minimal value, written by someone who seems to have an axe to grind.<br />The book left me with two impressions. The first impression is that the author did not really have anything new to contribute to an                      understanding of the life of Tolkien, instead relying on humorous anecdotes, rehashing of Tolkien's relationship with CS Lewis, and                      materials found elsewhere. The second impression is that the author bears a serious grudge against the Tolkien family for not permitting the                      access to family papers that was accorded to the authorized biographer, Humphrey Carpenter. This grudge is manifested in snide asides                      about Tolkien's literary executors. Finally, I must criticize the author for his excursus into the politics surrounding the Nigerian civil war.                      What this has to do with Tolkien is unclear at best.<br />                     Money is far better spent on Humphrey Carpenter's biography, and his edition of letters (especially the letters). It is in the letters where                      the spirit and genius of Tolkien best comes through.<br />Give this volume a miss.	2000-11-01

O'Brien)	Books	4	44	46	N	N	An outstanding conclusion to a great series	&quot;Eclipse of the Sun&quot;, Michael O'Brien's third novel in the trilogy which began with &quot;Strangers and Sojourners&quot; and continued with &quot;Plague Journal&quot; is an outstanding conclusion to this excellent series.  It picks up from where &quot;Plague Journal&quot; leaves off, but from a different perspective.  Fortunately there are enough characters which appear in all three novels, allowing for a more or less seamless transition of perspective.<br />O'Brien continues his tale of the Delaney family and their friends and acquaintences and their trials and tribulations at the turning of the 21st century in British Colombia.  There are two main themes:  One theme concerns the eschatological prophecies in the book of Revelation, and their relevance to the dawning of the 21st century.  The other theme concerns the quiet evaporation of personal and civil liberties which have been gradually occuring in the Western &quot;democracies&quot;.  These themes are knit so closely together, one is not always sure whether Revelation is a vehicle for O'Brien's political concerns or whether O'Brien's political concerns are a vehicle for his eschatological theories.<br />Regardless of which it is, the reader will have a difficult time putting this book down.  <br />O'Brien's deeply held Catholicism shines forth brightly in this book -- and frankly, it is refreshing.  It is unusual in this day and age for a Catholic to write &quot;End-Times&quot; novels -- such is usually the provence of fundamentalists (who usually hate the Church).  His Catholicism is traditional, conservative and uncompromising, yet very human and full of compassion.  The religious one meets in his books (including this one) are the very sort that one wishes there were more of!  (In my experience, as someone raised in a traditional Anglican background, one of the major reasons that Catholicism has not made the inroads into my former denomination that it could make is due to the progressive hogwash that all too frequently passes for Catholicism in North America.  A few more priests like Father Andrei, and a few more bishops like the Archbishop of Vancouver in &quot;Eclipse&quot; would go a long way in attracting converts from a slowing dying Anglicanism.  But I digress)<br />For me, this book rates 4.25 stars.  5 for story content, and 3.5 for character development.  One flaw in the book (or perhaps it's merely a flaw in my personal taste) is O'Brien's tendency to develop a character, then suddenly drop them, never to be seen again.  He also does not, to my way of thinking, always sufficiently explain how a character develops from when he/she is first presented to how he/she ends up.  One is left wondering why such and such a character changed so radically.<br />Finally, this book shows an interesting respect for conservative, yet non-Catholic clergy.  O'Brien is not nearly as hard on his &quot;seperated brethren&quot; as many conservative Catholics tend to be.  And he is equally hard on liberal Catholics as he is on liberal Protestants.<br />I would very much like to meet Mr. O'Brien some day.  I have enjoyed his novels; I have enjoyed his non-fiction; I appreciate and respect his faith; (and I have an enormous respect for his understanding of JRR Tolkien).  I know a wonderful Irish pub where we could light up the pipes, raise a pint or two, and discuss literature and theology for hours on end.	2000-10-27

Frankly, this does not matter, and the wise historian will accept Eusebius for his accomplishments, and place his great value as a historian in its proper context.  The foolish pseudo-historian will make the mistake of trying to apply 20th century standards (such as there are) to this 4th century document.<br />As far as my own personal interests and research are concerned, I found his discussion of the Canon of the New Testament to be most informative.  It provides a snapshot view of what was held in the beginning of the 4th century, which can then be compared to a similar snapshot view from the end of the 4th century (Athanasius, for example) or beginning of the 5th century (Augustine, for example).<br />Other scholars may well be interested in Eusebius' discussion of heresies and heretics; persecutions; martyrs, etc.<br />A wonderful resource which should be widely used by both religious and secular historians.	2000-10-25

His incorporatin of the role of Mary in the Church was also worthy of note.<br />  A good read for anyone wishing to understand the theology behind the papacy, and how the Church is organized.<br />This book gave me a lot to think about.	2000-10-25

I enjoyed the book; indeed, I found it profoundly moving at numerous points.  The spiritual depth was extremely insightful.  O'Brien is a masterful storyteller.  However, for many, the flaws in this book would be difficult to overcome.  I found the prose overly florid much of the time.  I found some of the characterizations weak (or at least, unbelievable).  I thought that the storyline dragged at bit at times.  But overall, I considered my reading as time well spent.  <br />One thing that O'Brien does very well, however, is to issue a clarion call against the decay in modern society.  I'm not sure that I completly buy into his eschatology, but I certainly agree with his characterization of modernity.<br />An inspiring, but not brilliant book.	2000-10-11

I was, as some of my friends can attest, very suspicious of the idea of homeschooling, and frankly, had seen some abuses take place.  I am still critical of some of the methods and rationales of some homeschoolers -- but they probably have the same view of myself and my methods!<br />However, this book changed my mind.  Dr. Clark describes in painstaking detail using the Scriptures, the teachings of the Church, and examples from history the benefits and justifications for the homeschooling of children.  Each chapter set out, in detail, a separate theme discussing various aspects of homeschooling.  Included were chapters dealing with difficult issues, such as the role of the father in homeschooling, homeschooling in a single parent household, dealing with children with special needs, legal aspects to homeschooling, etc.<br />It also demonstrated an openness by Catholic homeschoolers for the rights of Protestant homeschoolers.  Unfortunately, in my experience, the same openness has not been demonstrated flowing back the other way.<br />If the book has a flaw at all, it is that it is a bit dated.  The section on computers could stand a major update, and legal issues change so frequently that, while the general legal information is quite valuable, anything specific needs to be updated as well.<br />It is my hope that the author and publisher strongly consider a revised edition.	2000-10-04

He has analyzed children's literature, concentrating especially in the genre of fantasy and fairy story.  He has clearly and cogently demonstrated how neo-paganism has become the dominant worldview of many authors in this genre.<br />Unlike many Christian authors, O'Brien has not made the mistake of throwing the baby out with the bath water.  He does not lump all fantasy literature together in one category and toss it out.  He carefully demonstrates the difference between good and bad fantasy literature, or, if you will, authentic and inauthentic fairy stories.<br />I do have a few points of contention, but they are minor, and detract very little from the overall value of the book.<br />1) CS Lewis is identified correctly as an Anglican -- a member of the Church of England -- but incorrectly as a member of that church's Evangelical wing.  Lewis, in fact, attended a &quot;High Church&quot; parish, and strongly resisted political factions within churches.<br />2) JRR Tolkien is correctly held up as the model by which modern fantasy and fairy story should be judged.  Having said this, very little actual analysis is provided for Tolkien's writings.<br />3) Similarly, in the book's &quot;blurb&quot;, Charles Williams is held up -- but then not analyzed in the text.  An analysis of Williams would have made O'Brien's concerns about Lewis' novel &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; make more sense.  (I'd still disagree with O'Brien on this one, but his case would have been stronger and easier to sensibly defend.)<br />4) O'Brien's analysis of Anne McCaffrey's &quot;Pern&quot; stories needed either to be fully developed, or eliminated entirely.  O'Brien is using the image of the dragon as a neo-pagan symbol as one of the cornerstones of his book, and tries to place McCaffrey's &quot;good dragons&quot; within this context.  To me, it was unconvincing.<br />Overall, an excellent book.  As a final note to parents, O'Brien has helpfully added a lengthy appendix listing good (and usually available) books for children of all ages, arranged by level of difficulty and author.  An extremely helpful resource for homeschooling parents.	2000-10-04

It is an honest account of a spiritual journey, written by an articulate man, which should prove inspirational to all persons of faith, and to all on a spiritual pilgrimage.	2000-09-28

Readers of Drury's political novels will recognize his characteristic style of writing, character portrayal, and the like -- but the subject is one totally foreign to most Americans.

Andrew Greeley instantly suggests a &quot;liberal&quot; Catholic priest seeking to be a gadfly in the Church.  For some, the name conjures up some fairly steamy sex scenes in some of his novels.  For some, a competent, if media-hungry sociologist.  Readers of &quot;God Game&quot; will add &quot;imaginative Science Fiction writer&quot; to this eclectic mix.<br />In &quot;God Game&quot; Fr. Greeley presents us with the unusual scenario of a priest (not unlike the author) spending an evening playing a compter adventure game.  His home is struck by lightening, something is scrambled, and suddenly the images on his screen are real -- and the real characters think that he is God.<br />Yes, this might seem a little philosophical for many sci-fi fans -- but for those readers who expect depth in their books (regardless of genre) will want to read and re-read this one.<br />I still find myself in sharp philosophical and theological disagreement with Fr. Greeley -- and probably always will.  But in this book, the Irish storyteller comes to the fore in a wonderful way.	2000-09-22

As a theologian, I have long been interested in the philosophical/theological  ramifications of the man and his work.  I was hoping for much more than Mr.  Pearce provided in this book.  As I was reading it, I kept getting the  feeling that I had read it before -- and much of it, I had, in Carpenter's  biography and collection of letters.  Frankly, in my opinion, far more  material than was appropriate was culled from Carpenter for this to be  considered a truly original work.<br />Oh well!  I guess if I want the  definitive philosophical/theological work on Tolkien, I'll have to write it  myself!	2000-08-15

This is not fair to either history, or Catholicism.  <br />The  Reformation in England was a bloody time.  No reputable historian would  doubt it.  Foxe presents a tiny snapshot (more or less a decade) in which  the Catholics (under the aptly named &quot;Bloody&quot; Mary I) executed a  number of leading Protestant theologians and clergymen.  This much is  history.  Incorporated with the history are the personal polemics of Foxe,  which have little or nothing to do with the history of the times.<br />It's  interesting to note that the Catholics could just as easily present their  own book of martyrs, taken from pretty much the same time period, in order  to justify denouncing Protestants!  Henry VIII was just as unpleasant to  Catholics as his daughter was to Protestants!  And Elizabeth I executed as  many Catholics as Mary I did Protestants.<br />None of this is intended to  justify violence in the Name of God -- such is reprehensible no matter who  participates in it.  But both Catholics and Protestants have dirty hands,  and finger pointing serves no purpose.<br />Consider this book in its context,  but don't try to draw modern polemic conclusions from it.	2000-08-15

It is an invaluable resource for the graduate level or seminary student in  theology (and was, in fact, one of the texts used in my Historical Theology  class when I was a seminarian).  Kelly describes the evolution of creedal  thoughts and ideas, as well as the development of the various formulae  themselves, beginning with the Old Roman Baptismal statement through the  Creed of Nicea/Constantinople.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.	2000-08-11

The author demonstrates his in-depth knowledge of the Scriptures  and of Calvinistic theology.  He also makes an imposing (if not completely  convincing) case for a post-millinnial view of the End.  <br />This being  said, the negatives to this book so greatly outnumber the positives, that,  as a clergyman, I would have a difficult time recommending this book.  As a  non-Calvinist, I find his some of his presuppositions concerning covenantal  theology to be arrogant and unjustifiable.  As a Christian, I find some of  his conclusions to border on the anti-semitic.  As an academic scholar, I  find his &quot;contributers&quot; to the book offensive, out of line, and  completely over the top with the tenor of some of their remarks.  (Not  their opinions, mind you, they, like everyone else are freely entitled to  views different from mine!)

The casual observer, upon seeing this book,  might think about the medival papacy; the various schisms; the various  anti-popes; even the few absolute scoundrels which occupied the Throne of  Peter.  One would not expect what one gets.<br />From the perspective of this  non-Roman Catholic clergyman and historian, it seems that the best thing  that Mr. Wills could do would be to leave the Catholic Church (but please  don't come to mine!)  If Mr. Wills had not been such a highly regarded  author in the past, no one but a radical anti-Catholic publishing house  would have touched this manuscript.<br />Mr. Wills is not satisfied with his  dissent on matters of faith and morals:  abortion, contraception,  homosexuality, ordination of women, ministry of the priesthood, Office of  Peter, Real Presence in the Eucharist, etc.,(one wonders what's left - what  he DOES believe in) but makes the asinine assertion that the Papacy doesn't  believe in many of these things either, but continue to pronounce on them  in order to remain in power.  Such a charge, one would expect, would be  thoroughly documented and backed up with numerous examples from primary  source material.  Instead, one finds the same sort of drivel that one finds  in a Jack Chick tract.<br />If Mr. Wills wishes to dissent on virtually every  issue upon which the Catholic Church teaches, that is certainly his right.   But he (and, frankly, his publisher) should be ashamed that this book, as  written, ever came to see the light of day.	2000-08-11

(Translation:   It's not a Catholic issue -- it's a Christian issue).<br />It seems that most  people who attack this encyclical, do so from the perspective of not  actually having read and studied WHAT the Church actually teaches and WHY!   <br />This book provides a clear and compelling case for why what has ALWAYS  been the position of Christianity as a whole, should remain unaltered (and  be re-inforced).	2000-08-09

As a clergyman involved in the Charismatic movement, but also grounded in  traditional theological methods, I did not find this book convincing.  In  my opinion, (and personal experience) Welker's emphasis on freedom in the  Spirit can and has led to abuses in the name of that freedom.  In the last  50 years, many things in the Church have been justified in the name of  &quot;freedom in the Spirit&quot; -- a number of which have been nothing  more than exercises in self-justification.<br />I cannot, in good conscience,  recommend this book.	2000-08-09

I could not possibly disagree more with the post-modern theology portrayed  in this poorly written book.  But theological disagreements are one thing;  factual errors are another entirely.  In this book, Haight tries to relate  Tillich and Rahner in a manner which does not recognize the very real  theological differences between these two thinkers, even though there were  many elements the two had in common.<br />I read this book in a doctoral  seminar on Christian Apologetics -- and that's what it is -- and apology in  the worst sense of the word.

While it is certainly  possible (indeed, probable) to obtain a certain understanding about the  life and ministry of Jesus by reading the Gospels and ignoring the entire  Old Testament, one obtains a much fuller vision of the meaning of the  Gospels if one has an understanding of the Old Testament.<br />This analogy  fits very well with the relationship between &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;  and Tolkien's other fiction.  In &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord  of the Rings&quot; one examines in close detail two specific episodes at  the end of the Third Age of Middle Earth, just like the Gospels give an  account of the brief life and ministry of Jesus.  &quot;The  Silmarillion&quot;, like the Old Testament, provides a grand, sweeping  background of thousands of years of history, making the later stories come  alive in a new, more deep, more rich fashion.<br />Like the Old Testament,  &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is not always an easy read.  But who says that  great books have to always be easy?  And &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is  indeed a great book.  I've read it now about 20 times, and re-read it  usually about twice a year.  I can no longer go through it without being  literally reduced to tears.<br />Who can fail to be moved by the creation of  the world?  Or by the great duel between Fingolfin and Morgoth?  Or by the  love and devotion of Finrod Felagund?  And who can even begin to claim to  understand any of Tolkien's thought without having been immersed in the  tale of Beren and Luthien?<br />My heart is moved, and my emotions rise to the  surface merely by writing these words.  If you do not read &quot;The  Silmarillion&quot;, you will be turning your back on one of the greatest,  most beautiful works of fiction ever written in the English language.	2000-08-08

This book is a must, not only for the serious student of sub-New  Testament literature, but also for pastors who wish to be informed as to  the highest scholarship in this field.  <br />This volume, dealing with the  apocryphal Gospel material, shows clearly Early Church thinking and beliefs  concerning the life and ministry of Christ, as well as the views of certain  heretical sects.  It also provides an insight into early &quot;popular  piety&quot; which has played such an important role in the development of  the Christian Church.	2000-07-25

In the past century, there has been a proliferation of dozens, if not hundreds of churches claiming relationships to &quot;Old Catholic&quot; or &quot;National Catholic&quot; bodies.  This book is a veritable &quot;Who's  Who&quot; in this rather specialized field.  Although the author is  unbiased in his organization, arrangement, and discussion of the various  persons purporting to be &quot;bishops&quot; in various churches, it is  easy to see that there are many pretenders in this arena.<br />Any scholar who  is interested in tracing claims of Apostolic Succession can not afford NOT  to use this book.  It is, by far, the foremost work on the subject.   <br />This being said, this is the sort of volume which needs to be updated on  a regular basis.  It's been a decade since it's publication -- it's time  for a new edition.	2000-07-25

A heartwarming and profound novel about an Eastern European who surprisingly becomes pope.

The late Church of England clergyman and Oxford scholar JND Kelly has, in his &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Popes&quot; provided a needed resource accessible to scholars, clergy, and laity alike, and is valuable for both  Protestants and Catholics.<br />The &quot;Dictionary&quot; summarizes the  life, important acts and writings, and controversies surrounding the  Successors to St. Peter, and the various pretenders to that throne.  He  doesn't pull any punches -- several of the medieval and Renassiance era  popes get the short shrift that they so desperately deserve!  But these  brief biographies are written without rancor, without agenda, and with good  bibliographic references so the reader can identify the primary source  material.  Furthermore, Kelly seperates fact from fiction, debunking David  Yallop's &quot;In God's Name: An Investigation into the Murder of Pope John  Paul I&quot; and the various legends surrounding the ficticious &quot;Pope  Joan&quot;.<br />All in all, a valuable reference text that belongs on the  shelf of every historian, clergyman and theological scholar.	2000-07-18

Hans Urs von Balthasar was, without a doubt, one of the most important Catholic systematic theologians of the 20th century.  This is the first book (of seven) of the first part of his &quot;trilogy&quot; which  outlines and describes his systematic theology.  As an introduction to his  systematics, it is an essential read.  To those not familiar with von  Balthasar, it's a wonderful place to start.<br />Unsatisfied with Rahner's  &quot;transcendental Thomism&quot; and his method of &quot;doing theology  from below&quot;, von Balthasar begins with the revelation of God.  The  entire systematic theology is structured around the ancient philosophical  transcendentals &quot;Beauty, Truth, and Goodness&quot;.  In this first  volume (and throughout the first part of the trilogy) von Balthasar  discusses the Revelation of God to humanity through form and  beauty.<br />Truly a remarkable book, and a good introduction to a remarkable  man.	2000-07-18

However, in many respects, this is not  a work of fiction, legal disclaimers notwithstanding.  These are real  characters, given false names, but functioning much as they actually did in  real life.  Around this, is a cleverly woven plot of conspiricy, heresy and  murder which is fictional (or at least conjectural in the mind of the  author!)<br />It is clear where Martin's sympathies lay -- and they were not  with the modern Church.  However, as the book was written in the mid 80's,  and Martin very obviously expected Pope John Paul II to die in that time  frame, (and considering that Martin himself is now dead), it is impossible  to conjecture whether or not he had a real person in mind for his novel's  ending.<br />As a public service, here is a brief comparison between Martin's  &quot;fictional&quot; characters, and their real-life counterparts:<br />Papa  Eugenio Profumi -- Pope Pius XII (Eugenio Pacelli)<br />Papa Angelica -- Pope  John XXIII (Roncalli)<br />Papa DaBrescia -- Pope Paul VI (Montini)<br />Papa  Serena -- Pope John Paul I (Albino Luciani)<br />Papa Bogdan Valeska -- Pope  John Paul II <br />Paolo Lercano -- Michele Sindona<br />Roberto Gonella --  Roberto Calvi<br />Cardinal Buff of Westminster -- Cardinal Hume of  Westminster<br />Metropolitan Nikodim -- Metropolitan Nikodim<br />Brother  Reginald of Zaite -- Brother Roger of Tazie<br />Benjamin National Bank --  Franklin National Bank<br />&quot;Problem Two&quot; aka P2 -- Italian Masonic  Lodge P2<br />And the list goes on. . .<br />All the &quot;fictional&quot; popes  in the novel lived exactly as long as their counterparts in real life, died  at just the right times (although Martin is colorful about who tried to  kill whom when), and did many of the same things.  Many of the  &quot;fictional&quot; criminals did whattheir counterparts in real life  were accused of doing, etc.<br />So yes, this is a good novel by itself -- but  remember that Martin had an agenda in writing it -- and the agenda was not  at all hidden.	2000-07-14

I first read this book shortly after it came out.  I have since re-read it, cover to cover, twice more.  I have also read in considerable depth other works on this subject.  Several things are clear to me:<br />Item:  The  author has an axe to grind against the Catholic Church over issues with  which he does not agree, namely, contraception.  The is constantly made  clear throughout the book, for reasons which are never made clear.<br />Item:  It is evident that there was a major financial scandal surrounding certain  Vatican Bank officials, among others.  I don't believe that anyone denies  this.  However, Yallop implicates in his &quot;plot&quot; a number of  Vatican officials who had nothing to do with the Bank.<br />Item:  Much has  been written in the last 20 years concerning the theological/philosophical  beliefs of Albino Luciani.  Yallop wishes to paint him as a  dyed-in-the-wool liberal.  But few others do the same.  Outside the details  of the financial scandal, Yallop has made many assertions which other  writers have strongly debated.<br />Item:  The Protestant clergyman and  scholar, JND Kelly, in his definitive &quot;Oxford Dictionary of the  Popes&quot; was strongly critical of Yallop's conclusions.  Unlike Yallop,  Kelly was a scholar who had no axe to grind.<br />Yes, there are many things  we don't know about the death of Pope John Paul I.  There are things we  will never know.  But Yallop has put together a most improbable case based  on a minimum of evidence.  NOT good investigative journalism.	2000-07-13

In &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;, Allen Drury gave us an insider's view of the US Senate.  Now, with &quot;A Shade of Difference&quot;, Drury tackles the United Nations and the subject of racism.<br />It is not often  that an author's second book, especially a sequel or a book in a series, is  as good as the first.  This book is an exception to that rule, topping, if  it is at all possible, his earlier work.<br />In &quot;A Shade of  Difference&quot;, Drury demonstrated that he not only understood the inner  workings of the United Nations, but that he was a political prophet,  accurately (in concept, if not in detail)  predicting the civil rights  struggles of the late 1960's.  He also provided the reader with several  unforgettable character images, even more so than in &quot;Advise and  Consent&quot;.  The examples which were for me the most striking, were the  passages which detailed the filibuster and death of Sen. Cooley, and the  impassioned speech to the United Nations made by Sen. Fry.<br />The subsequent  books in this series were good -- but none lived up to what Mr. Drury gave  us in the first two.<br />Like it's predecessor, &quot;A Shade of  Difference&quot; belongs on the reading list in every Civics classroom in  America.	2000-07-13

There is no doubt about it.  They have proposed a thesis - that America was discovered, explored, and founded as an explicitly Christian nation, and that God's  hand can be evident in it's early history - and have defended it well.   They have gone back to some interesting primary sources, which do, in fact,  shed light on our nation's early history.  As such, the book is a valuable  read.<br />THIS BEING SAID, for the author's thesis to stand, one must  comprehend and assume a totally Calvinistic understanding of Christian  theology, AND assume that our Founding Fathers were working under similar  paradigms.  Such an historical point of view is difficult to defend.  Some  of our nation's Founders did indeed come from such a theological viewpoint.   Many, however, did not.  (And our two significant founding documents were  penned by a Deist and an Episcopalian!) Such a point of view is also  difficult, not only to those who do not profess the Christian faith, but  for the enormous majority of those who do! (Catholics, Orthodox, many  Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists, some Baptists, etc.)  If a Calvinistic  viewpoint is removed from the book, the entire premise collapses.<br />Please  don't get me wrong -- Marshall and Manuel have assembled a great deal of  research, and have presented it in an interesting and entertaining fashion.   The &quot;facts&quot; are there.  It's just that I (speaking as both a  committed Christian and a historian) can't buy their  &quot;interpretation&quot; of those facts.	2000-06-29

From the perspective of this non-Roman Catholic clergyman, historian, and theologian, Karl Keating has done an excellent job of identifying &quot;anti-Catholicism&quot; for what it is, while at the same time,  providing clear answers to questions Protestants frequently ask of  Catholics.<br />The book's only significant flaws lie in the tendency of the  author to:<br />1) Not always clearly differentiate between  &quot;anti-Catholicism&quot; (which is morally equivalent to anti-Semitism  or racism) with legitimate theological disagreement.<br />2) Lump together  many Protestant groups that frankly don't necessarily fall under the  category of &quot;fundamentalist&quot;, ie. Evangelicals and  Pentecostals.<br />Other than this, however, Keating has done an excellent  job.  He has certainly raised the standard of debate for Protestant  Christians by demonstrating the obvious silliness (and in some cases,  deliberate dishonesty) of several of the major &quot;anti-Catholic&quot;  organizations.  A Protestant apologist who encounters a Catholic familiar  with Keating's material will have to rely on a grasp of Protestant  theology, instead of (all too typical) third-rate propaganda.<br />This book  has really caused me to think.  I thank Mr. Keating for writing it.  May  God bless us all as we continue to search for His Truth in all its  fullness.	2000-06-29

It's  a shame that in the confusion following Lewis's death, a better executor  could not have been found; perhaps, if this had been the case, much trouble  would have been averted.<br />Well, it's all water under the bridge now.

Marion Meade's &quot;Stealing Heaven&quot; is a wonderful and touching account of the love affair between Peter Abelard, one of the most significant thinkers of his age, and Heloise, who in a different time  period, might well have been considered the same.<br />A book like this has to  be written as a novel.  The events are too far in the distant past, and too  many details have been lost,  for much else.  As such, it is well written  and beautifully presented.  It engages the reader, and captures the  &quot;feel&quot; of 12th century France.<br />This being said, the book is not  without its flaws.  The focus is almost entirely on Heloise and her  personal sacrifices -- and there were two persons in this relationship.  In  one sense, Abelard suffered far greater loss, both personally and  professionally than did Heloise.  This is not adequately displayed in the  novel.  Meade makes numerous negative speculations about Abelard's motives  and feelings which really can't fairly be made.  Essentially, Meade tends  to look at the characters from a post-modern feminist viewpoint -- which is  fine, as long as the reader is aware of what she is doing, and that her  (Meade's) philosophical presuppositons were not those inherent in 12th  century France!  <br />Somewhat disturbing was Meade's suggestion that Abelard  was (or had been) engaged in homosexual relations with one or more of his  students prior to his involvment with Heloise.  This is a rather serious  (and unsubstantiated) charge which, in the eyes of many, would detract from  his character, but which is not borne out by the available historical  evidence.<br />I recommend this book with caution.  If you are looking for an  entertaining historical novel about some extremely colorful characters, you  will enjoy this book.  But you need to realize that there is a good deal of  fiction mixed in with fact -- and it is not always easy to discern the  difference.	2000-06-28

In &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;, Allen Drury introduces the reader not only to the inner workings of the United States Senate, but also to the very human realities of our elected officials.  His novel is filled with  believable characters, dealing with real problems and issues.  And he knows  the Senate from an insider's perspective.<br />Although the particular issues  are now a bit dated (although this was not the case when I first read the  book nearly 20 years ago), the realities of government are still the same  (if not worse).<br />Once upon a time, many people read this book in high  school.  It should be required reading in both literature and civics.<br />We  lost Mr. Drury a year or so ago at the age of 80.  From the perspective of  this reader, he will be sorely missed.	2000-06-02

I was going  to say that this book is like none other written in English during the 20th  century -- but that does not go nearly far enough.  Rather, this book is  one of the most important works of fiction since man first began to write.  The work is singularly complete.<br />Comedy?  -- It's there.<br />Tragedy? --  It's there.<br />Adventure? -- It's there.<br />True Love? -- It's  there.<br />Heroic Quest? -- It's there.<br />Mystery? -- It's there.<br />Good vs.  Evil? -- It's there.<br />Essentially, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is  more than fantasy literature (although it is that -- and the standard by  which all other fantasy literature of the 20th century is measured).  Rather, it is &quot;Fairy Story&quot; in the classic and most complete  sense of that term.  (See Tolkien's non-fiction essay &quot;Tree and  Leaf&quot; and you'll see what I mean -- the theological ramifications are  remarkable).<br />Please read this book.  It will change your life.  More than  any other work (save the Bible), it has changed mine.<br />Use the book as a  guide away from the modern and post-modern philosophies which have so  devastated our world -- and return to a time and place where truth and good  were constant.  Sit back, light a pipe, and read the story aloud to those  you love.<br />You will never be the same again.	2000-06-01

I was ridiculously eager for this book to be published.  And then, somewhat disappointed.  To my mind, this is the weakest of the series so far.<br />This being said, it is still a ripping good tale.  Jordan should be  commended for being able to (more or less) successfully sustain such a  mammoth story over so many volumes and such a period of time.<br />Although  not the strongest effort, again (as with all previous volumes), the plot  takes some interesting twists and turns, introducing new characters and new  tensions.<br />My fear, though, is that Jordan really does not know how, when,  or where the series is going to end.  There are an increasingly large  number of loose ends which will need to be tied together or the ending of  the series will be a disappointment of major proportions.	2000-05-26

Where is Mat?  Why has the role  of Perrin and Faile been so minimized?  And doesn't Elayne eventually need  to get to Rand, so that Min's &quot;vision&quot; is fulfilled?<br />I'm hoping  that the next volume can start to answer some of these questions.	2000-05-26

Being raised on Tolkien, I have always been quite suspicious of virtually all other fantasy.  Jordan does not come up to the level of Tolkien, but his work is engaging, exciting, and well worth reading.<br />My first  experience with this book (and subsequently the series) was the little 9  chapter &quot;freebie&quot; that many bookstores were giving away.  I was  hooked by the plot, checked the book out of the library, and was on my way.   At present, I've read &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; three times, and  never regretted the time spent.<br />If you like Tolkien, be forewarned.   Jordan does not come close.

It has often been said that if a lie is repeated loudly enough and often enough, it will finally be believed.  John Cornwell's book has, unfortunately, demonstrated the truth of this maxim.<br />As a non-Roman  Catholic clergyman, theologian, and historian, I am shocked and horrified  by the deceitful character assassination currently in vogue against the  person of Eugenio Pace lli, Pope Pius XII.  Cornwell, by use of citations  taken out of context, questionable research methods, and disingenuousness  about his own bias on the subject has produced a work of sensationalism  unworthy of a college term paper, much less a purported &quot;historical  work&quot;.Item:  In the very beginning of the book, Cornwell, by way of  implication, suggests his adherence to the Catholic faith.  However, in  1991, Cornwell made it clear that religion was something the world would be  far better without -- NOT what one would expect from a adherent of the  Catholic faith.  Why would he mislead the public about his religious  faith?<br />Item:  Cornwell has bragged about the amount of time spent in the  Vatican archives, as well as the unusual access granted to him.  However,  the archive records show that Cornwell actually spent very little time  researching primary source documents (or anything else) in the Vatican  archives.  Why would he mislead the public about something so easy to  verify?<br />Item:  Cornwell bases a large portion of his argument for Pius's  alleged anti-Semitism on a quote made by Pius, before he was elected Pope,  concerning his distaste for a particular Bolshevik who happened also to be  Jewish.  This is sloppy research at best, and blatant dishonesty at worst.  Pacelli's opposition of Communism, from day one, is well documented.  A  dislike for a particular Communist, who happened also to be Jewish is not  evidence of anti-Semitism.  Why would Cornwell make such a statement - a  statement that no high school history teacher would accept?<br />Item:  Pulitzer Prize winning World War II historian John Toland, has demonstrated  that the actions of Pius XII before and during WWII did more good than all  the international relief organizations and Allied government combined.  Pinchas Lapide, Israeli consul in Italy, estimated that the actions of the  Pope resulted in the saving of over 800,000 Jewish lives.  How can Cornwell  fail to take the work of his peers into serious account?<br />Item:  The  actions taken by Pius during WWII were praised by a wide variety of Jewish  leaders and organizations both when the war ended, and at Pius's death 13  years later, including:  the World Jewish Congress, the Anti-Defamation  League, the Synagogue Council of America, the Rabbinical Council of  America, the American Jewish Congress, the New York Board of Rabbis, the  American Jewish Committee, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the  American Jewish Committee, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the  National Conference of Christians and Jews and the National Council of  Jewish Women.  Why would Cornwell disregard the testimonies of individuals  and organizations who were, in many cases, eyewitnesses, participants, and  victims, in favor of unfounded conjecture more than 50 years later (when  most of the Pontiff's defenders are no longer living)?<br />Item:  At a couple  of points in the text, Cornwell directly contradicts the research of the  Rev'd. Dr. Owen Chadwick (who is not a Roman Catholic) which paints a very  sympathetic portrait of Pius. However, his contradictions are not backed up  by the available evidence.  Why then, would Cornwell make the mistake of  contradicting without evidence?<br />Perhaps the answers to these questions  lie in the popularity of sensational historical revisionism.  Perhaps they  lie in the motivations behind  Cornwell's rejection of his former  faith.<br />Perhaps they lie in a disapproval of Catholic Church policies on  other issues.  Perhaps they serve to cloud the real issue --which is that  during the Second World War, the Pope actually did something substantial,  demonstrating, as Scripture says, his faith by his works -- while the  governments of both the United Kingdom and the United States did  little.<br />Cornwell's book will undoubtedly sell many more copies than  Toland's writings, many more than Chadwick's research, and many more than  the serious academic efforts being made by real historians -- and that is a  grave shame.  But there are 800,000 persons who knew the truth -- first  hand. And it is Cornwell, and persons who believe his pseudo-research, who  make those 800,000 people victims - yet again.-which is that  during the Second World War, the Pope actually did something substantial,  demonstrating, as Scripture says, his faith by his works -- while the  governments of both the United Kingdom and the United States did  little.<br />Cornwell's book will undoubtedly sell many more copies than  Toland's writings, many more than Chadwick's research, and many more than  the serious academic efforts being made by real historians -- and that is a  grave shame.

This is THE space/disaster book that SHOULD have been made into a movie.  Jack McDevitt's &quot;Moonfall&quot; presents the reader with a gripping plot,  solid character development, and cutting edge &quot;hard&quot; science  fiction.<br />From the opening of &quot;Moonbase&quot; to the final  hair-raising solutions, this book is not to be missed.<br />From the  coattail-riding Vice-President who wants to be a real hero; the chaplain  (yes, unlike many SF writers, McDevitt is not ashamed to recognize that  most people have and need a faith) who truly discovers his own faith; the  young wife who discovers that her &quot;Casper Milquetoast&quot; husband is  far more of a hero than she ever believed; to the brilliant young scientist  who finally discovers the solution which may save the planet, McDevitt's  characters are deep and believable.<br />Finally, McDevitt's science is  plausible.  This is not a novel of the 24th century; rather it is set in  the mid 21st century, using technological concepts quite feasible in the  near future.<br />Of all the McDevitt books I own and have read (5), this one  is my favorite.

This is a book which needed to be written.  I don't agree with everything Ed Dobson and Cal Thomas say, either politically or religiously, but their message is vitally important.<br />As a minister of the Gospel, as a  clergyman, and as an outspoken conservative, I have long been dismayed when  my collegues (on both sides of the aisle) attempt to equate the Gospel  message with a political agenda.  I firmly believe that a clergyman has the  responsibility and duty to speak out on issues which affect his beliefs and  the beliefs of his church.  However, many, many members of the Religious  Right (and Left, for that matter) have gone far beyond such issues,  insisting that political philosophy is just as important, and just as  divinely inspired as the Ten Commandments or the Sermon on the Mount.   There are issues on which Christians should be completely united.  There  are other issues, as C. S. Lewis suggested, in which honest men may  reasonably disagree.<br />Dobson and Thomas have eloquently suggested that  many of the troubles of the Religious Right have been based in not knowing  the difference.<br />Again, I don't blindly accept many of the things that  Dobson and Thomas say -- but I agree with much of the spirit in which they  were written.<br />Every politically active member of the clergy should read  this book carefully, and with much prayer.	2000-05-23
