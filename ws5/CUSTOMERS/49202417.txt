Who was trying to kill the boys? <br />What was the mystery surrounding the deaths of 3 husbands? <br />This all leads to Honor Duval. <br /> <br />What happened to Captain Luke Prescott so that he is now out of the Texas Rangers? And who was the former theif and now friend, Gentleman Rafe Malone?  What were they up to?  Yup! they bought tickets for the raffle. <br /> <br />Honor Duval had two sons from her second marriage, Micah and Jason Best and a mother-in-law, Luella Bestto provide for and protect.  They rounded out the story and were the driving force behind Honor. <br /> <br />Yet there was some intrigue going on that the widow in yellow was not willing to tell Luke about until he agreed to protect her sons.  She just wanted to get away from Texas, away from the danger to her sons. <br /> <br />Luke demanded to see the quarter-miler mare, Starlight, that he won in the \\"raffle\\".  I had to laugh when he finally got to see her. <br />Then he is shown Brown Baggage and the Arab stallion.  Ideas slowly began to form. <br />I loved the subterfuge and the meeting of Richard Armstrong with Katie Starr at Gallagher's Inn [before her own adventure]. <br /> <br />Excellent story - excellent plot - great characters - good entertainment - excellent villian, good riddance of Wild Horse Jerry Mullins. <br /> <br />DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED - Look for Rafe's story in THE WEDDING RANSOM.  Good clean fun with a bit of history thrown in.	2005-10-10

Action [mild] mystery [realistic kind] Romance [of the moral kind]with a touch of the naughty [which is always the basis of chaos]. <br /> <br />Yup, Zack, the \\"Burkett Bastard\\" has returned to Cottonwood Creek, Texas 1860 with revenge in his heart. <br />Oh yeah, he found the right person through which to work his scheme, Reverend Harrison.  What was the mystery of the morning-glory seeds? <br /> <br />Ah, but to gain credability he needed the support of Morality Brown, the \\"Miracle girl\\".  Her seduction was uppermost in his mind. <br />I had to laugh at her niavity when Uncle Reverend declared himself as her prospective groom.  She is too full of goodness to recognize the evil of men. <br /> <br />Little Patrick Callahan was adopted by Morality and it was her job to see that he faced the straight and narrow.  He figures nicely into the scheme of things. <br /> <br />Wiley Zach had a weather helped plan to convince Morality to elope.  He also has a meeting with the son of the railroad magnet.   <br />When they arrive at Gallagher's Tavern and Traveler's Inn, we meet Dan Gallagher, a man about Zach's age and his nephew, Johnny Kincaid, the oldest son of Branch Kincaid and Katie Starr, of THE TEXAN'S BRIDE. <br />I loved the reminder of how Katie slapped Branch with two dead squirrels. <br /> <br />Well one thing lead to another with Morality not on speaking terms with her new husband.  Somehow I think love stepped in to plant its seed. <br />The story keeps up a wonderful pace with Zack laying down the trail to destroy the Burketts and the town of Cottonwood Creek. <br />Joshua and his wife Louise Burkett took in the Reverend and Morality with Patrick for the length of the tent revival.  Was this just a herring to fool people? <br /> <br />And we are allowed a glimmer of the past when Morality remembered a little girl called Lilah waiting for the return of her mother. <br /> <br />Don't be looking for the trashy morals written into many frontier stories but a strong passionate fight against the evils of the time.  Forgivness, emotional and mental growth and loving family bonds. [almost] and a great tornado! <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - Another keeper along with The Texan's Bride #1 of this set.	2005-10-05

Yet the attraction that he had felt for Mariah when they were both teen-agers has survived the years. <br /> <br />Mariah Scott has troubles with self-worth.  Damage done by her father is still with her after he dies.  But her \\"eternal\\" hope to be noticed 'again' by Nick finally leads her to take a chance when the opportunity presents itself. <br /> <br />Nick's whole concern at their re-establishing contact - with a little jabbing from his brother - is the welfare of his children. <br /> <br />But don't forget Mariah's lady friends [as their stories follow - making a wonderful 4 book set at this point]Betsy Hunter and Rayna Ludgrin, both widows, apparently. <br />Rayna's story follows in MONTANA WIFE - <br />Betsy's story follows in ROCKY MOUNTAIN MAN - and her brother, <br />Joshua's story follows in ROCKY MOUNTAIN WIDOW. <br /> <br />Nick's father, Jeb must have had a bit of bad luck with one marriage, to help color Nick's attitude when his wife, Lida betrayed him. <br /> <br />I think Will and Dakota must be Nick's half-brothers - I wonder if they will get their own stories. <br />Not pulse-pounding danger or mystery but the tornado did sound miserable - just a good family oriented story that tugs at the heart. <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- you may really like it.	2005-10-02

They proved to be as bad as Claire's husband, Ham for abuse. <br /> <br />Claire was determined never to let another man control her life. <br />Yeah, well the women don't last long out there without a man. <br />Men prove to be predators, as bad as the wolves. <br /> <br />Joshua intends to keep a close watch on Claire and protect her from her wicked in-laws.

His perceptions of others reactions were colored by the treatment he received after his injury. [I find that our perceptions of others are never accurate.] <br /> <br />Katherine Cutter was pregnant and no longer hopeful of having a better life, especially for her child. On her mother: [You fast loose your emotional connections to someone who keeps putting you down.] <br /> <br />Noah loved his brother, yet still knew him in reality.  His brother, Levi was not one to acknowledge responsibility. <br />Was it really the child he wanted to protect or the young woman he brother had claimed in marriage? <br /> <br />Noah found it easier to take Kate into his home as she didn't seem to find him different or repulsive.  Her acceptance went a long way to changing his life. <br /> <br />Kate was finding it hard to live with Noah, as he kept telling her she didn't have to do anything.  How would she spend her time?  She was used to working. <br /> <br />This is a tender romance with a lot of changes to live through and misunderstandings to clear up. MaMa Cutter had definitely developed into a person with class distinctions as a rule to live by.

Much against his will. <br />Thoroughly enjoyed his sidekicks, George Carstares and Michael, the Viscount Carrington and their little runs of interferance for Peter. <br /> <br />Ah, but the wicked Lady Caroline Daventry, Peter's mistress is bound and determined to wed the Earl.  Almost pulled it off. <br /> <br />Jack Frobisher, the heir apparent, is also determined not to let Peter and Penny produce an in line heir. <br />Now of course, this leads to the mixed-up [Regency] attitudes of the characters. <br />Peter likes Penny's wittyness but felt betrayed when she revealed her blindness.  Not knowing the cause of it.  <br />Nor was Penny honest enough to explain the reason for Gelert's attack on Jack. <br /> <br />Their efforts to understand each other led to some disturbing and sometimes funny situations. <br />The abduction and run was not as intense as the near rape in \\"The Dutiful Rake\\" but it led to a great scene of justice. <br /> <br />Ah yes, is there to be a romance between the sister, Sarah and George?  The age difference may be about the same as Peter, at 32 and Penny, at 19.

I was waiting for Marc to become suspecious of his friend, Jack Hamilton but he exhibited more brains and trust than I thought he would. <br /> <br />Lack of communication between the sexes was very definite in the Regency period and hasn't changed an awful lot in this day and age. <br />Marc showed human decency in offering marriage to Meg and eventually reaped the benefits of love. <br />Great cast of characters - a most enjoyable story - worthy of being a keeper <br /> <br />Please, Please, Please, E.R. write Jack's story - he is a wonderful character and we would like to meet the Earl and Meg again. <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- Great story - definitely a keeper for my shelf.	2005-07-16

It tickled my fancy as I realized what was going on in this family.  I was definitely ready to get away from the contemporary icky females. <br /> <br />The romance between Drake and Pearl was refreshing and I do love it when that male protective instinct kicks in. <br /> <br />Drake's aunt, Lily Stephens, was another kettle of fish.  I was looking for a little retaliation there. <br /> <br />Belle's story was right on the mark for that age - so much scuzzball testosterone running around. <br /> <br />Story was excellent - the characters were excellent - had to laugh at a couple of the villians.

But she found breath-stopping sex appeal ozzing from this wounded male. <br /> <br />Kelly suddenly realized that Cole could not make it down the stairs from over the Double Dip ice cream parlor where his parents now lived. <br /> <br />She very unobtrusively solved his problems of being able to get around and have a little freedom to be himself.  She very gently bullies him into attending J.J.'s and Mary Beth's wedding, here we meet up with Sam Bass Outlaw, his younger brother, and his sister Belle Starr Outlaw. [they should have had stories of their own] <br /> <br />They sure had troubles trying to get to bed with each other. [bummer] The little murder mystery seemed a little weak for Cole to handle and the teaching experience was an energizing experience.  One he didn't expect. <br /> <br />Well written stories with loose moraled females, when you think of them being the mothers of the next generation.  Very chancy. <br />A bit disappointing. <br /> <br />Enjoyable supporting characters - great small town - 2 surprising characters - great family connections in the Outlaws. <br /> <br />will recommend for a good read. <br /> <br />	2005-06-20

And finds an old schoolmate in Dr. Kelly Martin, who had moved to Naconiche about two years ago. <br /> <br />They soon become involved in the goings on in Naconiche and Carrie finds it impossible to forget her first meeting with Frank, thinking he is someone else. <br /> <br />In another coincidence, it seems that Frank has a paint mare that is descended from her uncle's stock.  A Calico mare that she loved. <br /> <br />Frank wants her to stay away from Clyde Burrows, who threatened the last oil man with his shotgun.  They considered Clyde dangerous. Clyde was on Carrie's list of owners that she would have to approach.  Did she know what she was doing? <br /> <br />Well there we go again with the bed hoping and no commitement in sight.  These hussies show up in most every book.  They have such trashy attitudes.  <br /> <br />Well she lied to Frank, or so he says, and he is not happy with Carrie.  But Carrie gets the job done - no strings attached.  And takes off for Oklahoma and catches cold. <br /> <br />A good read but these women's attitudes are a bit boring.	2005-06-18

CD did not leave us wondering what happened to her family of characters. <br /> <br />I will admit that I have not found my copy of \\"A Marriage By Chance\\" #1? An introduction of J. Cleary. <br />When I started \\"The Texan\\" with the story of U.S. Marshall Jonathan Cleary and his love, Augusta - I didn't know what to expect.  Was Great! <br />In \\"Tempting A Texan\\" Cleary sends Nicholas Garvey and his bride, & niece to Benning, Texas [about 50 miles away]where they find Faith Hudson of \\"Texas Gold\\" and of course then we meet Sheriff Brace Caulfield, who has a thing for Faith. <br /> <br />\\"Texas Lawman\\" gives more depth to the Caulfield character [1901] and the young woman he decides to marry. <br />Theirs turns out to be a tender love story where our lady, Sarah Murphy has no doubts about marrying the Sheriff. <br />The story involves her obtaining custody of her twin sister's son and she is willing to do anything to make that happen.  Even shoot the boy's abusive father, Lester.  Then his conniving brothers show up.  They need Stephen to collect an inheritance and wouldn't mind taking Sarah along too. <br /> <br />Brace finds himself willing to help her and obtain a wife into the bargain.  When Nicholas shows up in Benning it is about 1897 and Brace is well established so I wonder just how old he is.  He considers himself [at first] too old for Sarah, I think she is about 20 or so. <br /> <br />There is a wonderful bonding between Brace and little Stephen that tugs at Sarah's heart.   <br />It is not too action packed but has its moments [especially when Sarah is threatened with rape].  Nicholas and Brace and a group of men ride to the rescue. <br /> <br />CD has made up a group of wonderful characters in what I call her Benning series.  They are well worth reading and keeping. <br /> <br />DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED - I gotta find the first book -	2005-04-25

My only problem is the F'ing -well Hell what do you expect!  A little classier swearing!  [PS this is not about the SEALS]    Air Force Major Vanessa Blake has been trying for ten years to be allowed to join the Special Forces Ops but wouldn't you know the old windbags in Congress won't allow women in combat. She wonders why her father, a Navy SEAL kept going back on tour instead of staying with his family.  It caused a lot of bitterness in her mother.    Lieutenant Colonel Jack Scatalone was sent to the Free-fire zone Alpha in North Carolina to make contact with Blake.  He got tired of waiting and armed himself with a paint gun and ended up getting himself splatted.  A \\"kill\\" for Blake.  This is not what happens to him.  So he drags her [figuratively speaking] up before the JSOC commander, Wittenauer in full mud regalia.    Thus begins a combative give and take that is a joy to watch.  Scats job is to see that the women are given a chance to fail.  Or at least make them quit.  Blake has a two week period to find five women to make a team and a room full of all enlisted woman.  Being up on computers she enlists the help of one of the Pentagon hackers and picks out 5 woman in about four days.  Oh then begins the wonderful bonding of 5 diverse women into an operational team of deadly proportions.    Air Force Major Vanessa Blake - 33 - \\"Viper\\" - computer expert.  Captian Aleesha Gautier - \\"Mamba\\", Jamaican by birth, ER doctor,trained surgeon, fluent in French, Spanish & Portuguese, collegiate swimmer and scuba diver.  Air Force Test Pilot Misty Cordell - \\"Sidewinder\\" - 2 years retired - top stick in every squadron she ever flew with - Stunt pilot for fun - fluent in Russian & German - Champion surfer and triathlete for fun.  Marine officer Karen Turner - \\"Python\\" - been trying to get into Special Forces for years.  Officer Isabella Torres - \\"Adder\\" - top photographic image analist in air force intelligence & a cryptography expert - fluent in Spanich, French, Italian,Farsi, Hebrew and Arabic.  Katrina Kim - \\"Cobra\\" - half Korean petite, elegant - another who had fought for years to join, in her case army Special Forces sniper.  The women have high hopes that the testosterone fortress has been breached. They expect JSOC to give them the roughest, toughest, nastiest [...] for trainers.    At the same time [and running along with their training period] Delta Force three become lost in Bhoukar - these are Jack's men and he is upset and wants to find them.   We read of their ongoing experiences at the same time that Jack is trying to fail the women. Wittenauer and the President Stanforth confer with each other in trying to find these men.    :) Blake confronts Wittenauer [after the reported failed project \\"Medusa\\" and disappearance of Scatalone] to send in the Medusas as officially they don't exist. What did he have to lose?  This is so action packed and yet emotionally restrained that it is impossible to put down. It is always \\"just one more chapter\\".    You get to love the characters, the women's abilities to outthink their problems to cure their short comings.  There is a whole hearted respect developed for the men and women of this story.  And believe me - much more to the plot.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED **********  DEFINITELY A KEEPER - GOOD FOR READING MORE THAN ONCE.	2005-03-19

Then there was the scumbag, Colonel Hatcher, [grin] who left in some haste. <br /> <br />Marie has lost her two brothers in the battle at Gettysburg and her intended, Billy Canfield. <br /> <br />Another plus to the story was the way Phelan Canfields' sons, Joe and Jake took to Max.  Wonderful little rascals. <br /> <br />Max still carried the scars of the prison camp and its inhumanities.  Maria and Max, both, fought the attractions building between them.  This was something that, in all honor, could not happen between them.   Mr. Markham seemed to be the most sensible of persons. <br /> <br />Now the ladies, that is a different matter.

Arm wrestling was great sport in those days and Livingston decided to challenge the Jones boys.  <br /> <br />Cad couldn't believe his eyes, for Livingston was a bit scrawny and fastidious. Ah, but then he was introduced to the English muscle. The man filled the door, blocking the pale light of the setting sun.  He had massive, solid shoulders that looked like he could support the weight of the world as if it were a load of swansdown.  Now we meet Jon.

[look for this mystery]. <br />Quent, at 24 doesn't know what he wants to do with his life yet and being a bit of an artist, loves to draw scenes of places and people that he sees. <br />He wants to work and sees the cattle trail as a way to gain more experience of life.   Boy, does he ever! <br /> <br />The story of Annie's and Quent's meeting leads on to more and more of a darn good story and it is great as he tries to warn young Dan of the dangers of loose women. <br />I can understand his vow of celibacy [not unknown to some men of character] after seeing what his college friends went through after bedding contaminated women.   [Smart guy!] <br /> <br />Although being promised to Mr. McCann by her father, Annie was having a hard time not recognizing van Kelson as a man with temptations and a danger to her.  She would hold to her promise to her father.  <br /> <br />Quent very soon earned the nickname of \\"Dunk\\" from the cowhands and had no problem earning their respect.  He took well to their jokes on him and even turn the tables.  He even saves the day and helps build a bridge for the cattle to pass over. <br /> <br />I love Old Nick's searching out of the families of an ancester, a pirate, no less and had to laugh when Broadbrim announced his name. <br /> <br />This is a highly injoyable and entertaining story with great characters and neat plot weaving. <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED --?

And Romance is NOT all about sex.<br />Ah, Bartered? Frederich bartered his freedom for the love of his daughters even at the expense of his need for revenge.<br />Caroline Holt bartered her freedom and excepted her humiliation for the sake of her unborn child.<br />Her misplaced love for a refined, educated man caused her surrender to his seduction. The Blackguard!<br />Frederich was not going to allow his brother, Eli to step in when he wanted to revoke his offer of marriage to Caroline's brother, Avery.  Another arrogant man in Caroline's life.<br />And in the German Church in front of the whole congregation. [Just a note: Caroline did not understand the German language]<br />Loved her brother, William's comment that even though he could not speak German, he could catch the drift of what was being said.<br />Caroline felt she had to endure most anything for her dead sisters' sake and for her nieces, Lise and Mary Louise that she loved very much.<br />She had a hard time understanding why her brother-in-law was not at his wife, Ann's side when she died.  Comes of not knowing the truth.<br />She was taken aback when she saw the tender, loving way Frederich had with his daughters.  His mistake was in believing his sister, Beata would get along with his wives.  Beata shows what jealosy and discontent will do to warp a person's character.<br />Frederich had a man's view in assuming Caroline would know what he expected of her.  Such lack of communication.  And because of his lack of trust and sense of betrayal he could not express his feelings as they grew stronger for Caroline.  Until the war started leveling everyone's concept of life.<br />Frederich would no allow Caroline to die and he helped her to grieve, she in turn would not allow him to die of his wounds.<br />What a wonderful story of how the human spirit keeps on striving against all odds and sometimes finds it place in the scheme of things.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- will definitely be keeping all of her books.

Yuck!<br />As any good God fearing mistress [as in wife]she looks after any company that shows up - her uninvited in-laws -- the slaves of her husband and his one hundred acre farm.<br />This is a story of survival in a god-forsaken country where the English are determined to beat the French - use the Indians and are arrogantly sure that they are in the right.<br />Men are the ultimately dominating rulers with power -- women have no say in what happens to them and woe be to them if they do not have a protector.<br />The Indians who helped the French were being captured and made slaves or killed, their scalps sold for a bounty.  They were mistreated, tortured and starved.  Five Killer and his son suffered these attrocities at the hands of Major Elway and his bondman. Hatcher - who of course, wanted Hannah.<br />Maw, the Cherokee war warrior, lost credibility [with me] in going after Hannah instead of following through in killing Major Elway for the lose of his family.<br />I did love the part where Wa-le-li told Hannah that Five Killer did not remember the love spell she worked for him many years ago, after his wife had been brutally killed.<br />&quot;The love spells take their own time. ---- But work they do.&quot;<br />The story was so excellent that I wanted to deliver the Major up to Maw myself.

Tage had saved her life and she had fallen in love as any fourteen year old girl would.<br />Unraveling M. Early's mystery's involving her traumatized characters is what makes her stories unforgettable.  Though I find the parties hard to deal with, nevertheless I find myself learning more about troubled people.<br />Lars is an excellent character and figures well in the story -- but Moses, the wolf - he would be one dead wolf if that had been my story  --  although he shouldn't have to suffer for peoples mistaken ideas that you can make a pet of a wild instinct animal - nor can he be trusted  -- you don't interfer with the wild ones.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED --M Can't understand Sarah's reasoning for illicit sex.

Step number 1.<br />Charlie got drafted into the war and spent a lot of time flying. Cesca let fear take over.  The war took its toll on Charlie as on all the men and escaped in drinking.<BR>Cesca, like all insecure women, took the road of escape in divorce instead of heading home.  Step number 2.<br />Now twenty years later, living with regret, she returns home to Alaska and Charlie, who has been on the wagon for seventeen years, to check into the death of Mia, her midwife protege.<br />Now in their fifties, and unknowingly still in love, Charlie and Cesca meet for transport to Talkeetna.

Did they sleep together?<br />And who was Alan, the young adonis that lived across from Mia's shack?  Charlie did not like Cesca's attraction to the young man.<BR>Why had Mia listed Francesca as the person to call if anything happened to her?  Where was Mia's ex-husband?<br />Pammie Sue and Roy Walcott Jr. had three children that Cesca had yet to meet. Stormy, Pammie Sue's sister, was Cesca's close friend, still in Hawaii.<BR>Then there was the police officer, Peter.<br />Then off and on we hear the conversations that Francesca has with their daughter, Tara.

Due to the knowledge of her infertility [which apparently she did not tell her mother] she decided to keep Julia's baby when Julia asked her to and then left the baby in her car.<br />M. Early writes a powerful story but for some reason I couldn't get any feeling for the passion that supposedly existed between Isaac and Tara.  She has a deep love for the children but has so much emotional baggage she seems unreal.<br />And yet the characters are very real with their problems - I love the children and their interaction - but the reasons for sex just didn't jell.<br />It seems like Tara and her mother just can't face their problems and don't even want to acknowledge them.  What was it with Tara that she didn't want to become certified??  She was naking it hard on everyone -- she seems to be one of the people that make their own hell on earth.<br />Still a wonderful story - a bit touchy to read in coming to an understanding of her motives -- very strange.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED --M  - a bit iffy if you want to keep it to read again.	2003-12-31

Nick is 13 and Molly is 6, then to find out that her father had been alive just a few months ago. Wow!<br />Alec is working out his post-trauma of his military days and loves working with children in social services, trying to help better orphaned or abused children's lives.<br />Alex has a sister and brother-in-law and is very close to them and values family.  So he is hoping that Tess will come to understand the gift of having a family.<br />Finally with Mavis guiding her and kicking the stinking habit of living for her career, Tess comes to value the love that is blossoming between her and Molly and learning to guide Nick into adolescence with Alec's help.<br />Ah, we slowly come to realize that there is some kind of hanky-pankying going on with the kid's lawyer, Jed Walker and the art dealer.<br />I loved the way Alec's sister was woven in  to help bring understanding to Tess about Alec's past.  The attraction of the two was lightly touched upon - enough to solidify the romance without boring the story - not every story needs [physical attraction] to hold it together.  Did feel that Tess was not suspecious enough when dealing with the father's estate but then a lot of women are dumb when it comes to legal matters.<br />I think the story was well written and thoroughly enjoyable and different from all the PMS written into most every story. As you know I hate the premise that premarital bed hoping is the norm - ah well, to each his own.<br />Very Definitely Recommend --------- It will be enjoyed by a lot of readers [with open minds]!	2003-08-21

But I was still perturbed with her. Ugh! <br />Definitely recommended - despite the twitty women and Brock paying for his past mistakes.	2003-05-25

His was a deeply emotional story that I could almost feel the state of shock that gripped him.<br />Even though he had the Guardsmen to watch out for his back you almost get the feeling that he is standing alone.  The villeneous element seems to be down played and yet it was always there at the back of your mind.  The story kept moving at an excellent pace that made it hard to put down.<br />The opening train ride was great, the characters were woven into the great skein of life that kept you moving forward. Fascinating!<br />Annalee Amory, being the sistor to Victoria who married Logan Youngblood in BELOVED OUTCAST seemed to be a bit helter-skelter in a most innocent way. And by the time her cousin got through with her she seemed to have matured a bit.<br />I loved the contratempts that arose when we met Hunter's mother and her beau of a Brit, Lord Ravenscroft. It appears that Hunter was lucky in getting in the first blow.<br />I had to laugh when Hunter thought that Annalee &quot;Letty Codtoast&quot; Amory was having an affair with old &quot;fossil-breath&quot; [who turned out to be her cousin].  He really felt that he was rescuing her from a very bad arrangement.<br />All of these men seem to proposition their women before [or while] falling deeply in love with them. What a lark!<br />But don't forget that Frank Sutton is still in the background and his revelations were horrendeous.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- definitely look for the other books in this series -- BELOVED OUTCAST - CADE'S JUSTICE -- BURKE'S RULES and HUNTER'S LAW [one of the best collections I have come across outside of Patricia Veryan's set of books!]	2003-05-18

I have tracked him on more than several covers. Best part of the book [grin]<br />The murder mystery of Frannie Granger, \\"Mom Fran\\" rolls on - a bit light on clues and threats but nicely damaging.<BR>Tessa comes across as a bit wishy, being under her mother's thumb a bit much and is willing to settle for an affair?<br />Will McClain came across as a stronger character, enough to tone down Sheriff Fielder. Logan Fielder tended to mellow out in this story. Got a bit of a chuckle on Amanda Jennings attempts to pick up again with Will. Did she think she was still back in high school?<br />Then there was Ray Jennings snobbish attempts to put down Will and others in his town. Joleen Berber finally got in her two cents worth and settled everyone's hash.<br />Loved the final tie-ins that brought together Jed Louis and his wife Gwyn, Emmy-M, Riley Gray Wolf and Alanna & Will and finally Tessa.  They all had learned the value of the family circle.<br />The mystery was pretty decent, the action was good but the romances were kind of like wet noodles.  I have found that denial and frustration lends to a more passionate build-up and makes you want more. These three \\"ladies\\"? just didn't promote very strong romantic feelings. [The characters not the writers]<br />The series is a good read and will recommend but not keep.	2003-04-30

Who Is Emerald Monday?  The suspicions are there.<br />Roz Denny Fox surely accomplished her objective in presenting a good character, as I couldn't stand Emmy-M. Her lack of moral conscience killed the romance and to wait nineteen years to do something about her lack of parentage? Nope, doesn't work.<br />I thoroughly understood the emotional conflicts of Emmy and Riley but not how they tended to work them out.  Little Alanna was one big saving factor. She did tie the couple together with an innocence accorded only to the very young.<br />Must say Joleen Berber knows more than she is letting on and probably has a guilty conscience or a fear of being found out.<br />The mystery is still on the light side but a very easy reading of a bit of old intrigue. And poor Josey and Cleon hanging on for ten years with no marriage in sight? Another misspent youth!<br />Why did it take nineteen years and a murder mystery to finally get them to start straightening out their hang-ups?<br />Ah well - my ratings -- Roz Denny Fox - her writing - a 4<BR>                        Emerald Monday -- a 2<BR>                        Riley Gray Wolf -- a 3<BR>                        Dexter Thorndyke -- a 5<BR>                        Sheriff Logan Fielder -- a 4 [he's still a stinker]<br />Recommend for a follow-up read  -- not one that will stay on my shelf	2003-04-28

Love his put-down of Fielder and the D.A., Philpott.<br />Questions?  What happened to Emmy-M [she was just 13 when the Social Workers snatched her] and Will, he just took off? or were they murdered?  Who was Frannie's enemy? What did she happen to know? [Now me, I suspect Ray Jennings the local banker] He had the power of attorney of Walter Louis's estate until Jed inherited. Of course the sheriff is up to something, trying to railroad Jed.<br />Poor little rich girl, Gwyn Miller of the fabulously rich Millers had been really lacking in the love and family feeling that Jed had known.

WAS SHE A SURPRISE TO HIM -	Jared wasn't particularly interested in a good looking woman, all he needed was a housekeeper...not that he would pass up a bed partner. Coming up out of a hangover, the sombre [yet handsome?] rancher got a bit of a shock when he saw Glenna and she revealed her bruises.<br />Glenna was willing to learn what it took to live on the Kansas prairie if only she could provide the promised home for her blind sister, Mary.  But her foiled attempts with her widow's disguise to gain money to support her sister raised many doubts in Jareds' mind.  What was she up to??<br />Little by little the generous gestures by Glenna began to make a small impression on Jared. Just don't ask about \\"Janie\\".<BR>Glenna's conclusion was that Jared had loved Janie very much.<BR>Glenna took immediately to Lyden...the twenty month old son of Jared.<br />I loved meeting Jared's brother, Joseph and his wife, Cally. And their eight children, 17 year old John, 16 year old Charity, then 15 year old twins, Matthew and Mark [they picked them up in Topeka on their way to the ranch] then there is 14 year old, Luke who is quiet and musical, like his mother.<BR>[grin] Jared figured that his brother must have needed a rest because the next set of twins are 10 year old, Peter and Paul. [chuckle, chuckle] then six years later, little 4 year old Annie is born, \\"she is a sweetheart\\" according to Jared and she wants to marry Uncle Jared when she grows up.  Oh, yes, and Cally is expecting again.  Whee! what a great family.<br />Joseph is 36 and Jared is 33 [boy, does he have a way to go - sibling competition, you know] Of course Glenna is only 24.<br />Glenna, being from Chicago [Jared's nickname for her was \\"city-girl\\"]just about had histerics when a rattlesnake appeared up from the floorboards and was heading for the baby.  One of the many reasons why Jared kept telling Glenna that it was too dangerous for a blind child to live on the ranch. But Glenna kept trying to think up adjustments to make the ranch livablefor Mary.<br />Oh, yes - it did take a while for Glenna to let her handsome husband into her bed.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - thoroughly enjoyable - excellent read and keeps you interest.	2003-04-24

To the disenters - Have you ever been in Kentucky in 1781? grin!<BR>One complaint - cover editor - hey, 1781, women didn't dress like that. Dumb!<br />Our big burly trapper, Kane Devlin is returning home from the wars [George Washington, remember?] He seemed to have survived with a fair decent attitude, despite the hardships he would have had to suffer. Along the way he picked up the mistreated dog &quot;Hound&quot;, that should speak well of him.  Now to stumble upon D'lise Alexander being attacked by her beastly uncle brought him to another rescue.<br />Now for a man's man being used to surviving in the wilderness and through a war, taking on a young girl was bound to bring complications. Being in a world where there were more men than good women his protective instincts were being kicked into high gear.<br />I found it hard to accept that they would be leaving 15 year old David and 10 year old Johnny behind to the mercy of that brute, Rufus. Picking up the woe-begotten Scrag brought about humorous results. <br />Yup! you're right, Raven was one nasty piece of work, but then she was jealous, afraid of losing an easy life of support and out for revenge.<br />Got a big kick out of Big Beaver and the way he wove in and out of Kane's life and proved to be a great friend of both Kane and D'lise. Was surprised as Kane when I found out he had remarried.<br />Loved the way the settlement ladies rallied around D'lise and chuckled at Kane's jealousy of Samual. Samuel was an educated man and ran the emporiam of ladies ware and had two small daughters.<br />Ah, but then David and Johnny showed up and Raven continued to cause mischief, claiming to be carrying Kane's child and then D'lise finds out that she is in the family way and walks out on Kane even though he has been wounded.<br />Ah, the vagaries of life. You must also meet the old gentleman, Tom who figures quite helpfully in D'lise's life.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- try it you will like it. Such a change from all the amoral heroines running around in the contemporary stories. [although too many b-witches thoughout the story but they probably did talk like that.]	2003-04-22

I must admit that I gave a five star due to the authors excellent writing but found it hard to tolerate the heroine's obsession with the horses.  Horses first, in her book that was the priority.<br />Ellen has come a long way from her treatment by Garth but still was very insecure.  Again was surprised with the way she dealt with Kevin's omissions. With both fighting their attractions, they still hopped in bed with flimzey excuses.<br />Was great to meet up with Chance and Taryn again. Could understand the brothers' reactions to each other but both were there for each other in time of need.<br />Garth [deliciously] was the same old scuzzball. And the new evil was another emotionally and psychologically messed up person.<br />Not quite as many people involved in Red Thunder Reckoning as in Chance's story but still it worked well - kept you on edge somewhat and had a new twist with the horses.<br />Unanswered question! Was Ellen affected the same way the horses were? If not, why? Didn't she lose any? Did love Blue coming to the rescue.<br />Will definitely Recommend the set as an excellent read - characters great - stories move at an excellent pace.<BR>Had to be excellent because I couldn't stand Ellen's obsession so the author did come across quite well in her characterizations.	2003-04-18

Loved the conflict between Angus Conover and Nola Barnes.<br />Carter Paxton was bound to have his revenge for what happened to his daughter Ellen. [the dummy was looking in the wrong direction.]<br />Dr. Benton and Doug Talberg left me wondering just where and how they fit in.<br />Joely Brahms, Ashbrooks' town librarian, has many answers but was set up by the resident evil.<br />Chance was beset by blankness and confusion while trying to piece his past back together. He was afraid that his search would endanger Taryn but he couldn't shake her.<br />You live the tension and suspense as the story unfolds and enjoy the ending.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - this will be a keeper for the bookshelf to be enjoyed again in the future.	2003-04-16

I wonder what he planned to do with her son, Mason?<br />\\"Latigo\\" was thirty three and half Chiricahua Apache and in dire need of John Colby's help. He knew he was taking a chance in approaching John's ranch but it would be hard to survive in the desert wounded as he was.<br />Rose was not sure that she should befriend \\"Latigo\\" as there was no one around to protect her and Mason. She did prove to be a stubborn woman<br />Burford soon showed up with his vigilante riders and accused the half-breed scout of murder. Rose was already forming her own opinion on whether she should help John's rescuer or not. And Burford sure didn't leave Rose with any good opinion of him when he tries to force her to agree to marry him.  Yuck!<br />The plot thickens when \\"Latigo\\" hints at the dangerous \\"Ring\\" and that John may have had some connection with it. Rose had to know the truth for the sake of her son and thereby begins an appealing romance.<br />Cover does not do \\"Latigo\\" justice. Does'nt look like a half-bred Native American. Surely the book companies could scout around and find some decent, rugged looking Native Americans to use on their covers.<br />Definitely RECOMMENDED - you will enjoy the story line and the characters and tidbits of Native American folk lore.	2003-04-08

Wow. Rue has this niggling feeling of being watched. <br />Hawke and Rue stop overnight at the mountain man, Adams, cabin on their long trek. I did like this character.<br />Typical of the man, Hawke does not tell Rue that his father, Jeb is arriving with his nephew, Tommy and niece, Susie and that she is expected to care for them.<br />I do think that Hawke got what he deserved for carrying on with the neighbor's wife, Lillie Meyers, and her treatment of Rue when they stopped at the Meyers ranch.<br />Another key character will be Little Star and his grandfather, Native Americans living a few hours away from Hawke's ranch.<BR>Ah, then there is Uncle Wolf, brother to Little Star and Tiny Fist's father, he desires Rue for a wife.

Must have seemed imperative to develop him into a legend.<br />Joe loved his aircraft but was curious about the replacement to the laser division, Caroline Evans. His mental assessment of her kicked his hormones into overdrive. Her opening sass caught his attention.<br />Caroline got along with most of her workers Cal Gilchrist and Yates but had problems with Adrian. The resolution of their sniping at each other was a bit of a surprise.<br />Didn't like the slowing down of the meat of the story to concentrate on the deliberate seduction and Caroline's silly surrender. But that is how she goes!<br />Interest picked up again when Caroline became a suspect in the possible sabotage downing an F-22. Even more interesting was her reaction when she realized that Joe questioned her involvement.<br />I really liked the part where Joe opens up and we find out about the children that Wolf and Mary have had. Michael, their first born is now 18, and Joshua is 16, he appears to be a jet freak like Joe at his age, then there is Zane. He appears intense, silent and dangerous, like Wolf. And they finally got their daughter, Maris who is like her dad, who is sheer magic with horses.  Ah, the magic of family. Joe is proud of them and loves them intensely.<br />Now back to the good part. Caroline, through some realistic deduction finally gets an idea of who is responsible for the skrewups and decides to tackle the party on her own. Another stupid move on the part of a woman. Joe ends up following her and walks into an ambush which ends up leaving them high and dry in the desert.<br />Breed's emotions are so intense by now that he decides to marry Caroline. There is nothing like shared danger and experiences.<BR>Wolf and Mary get their first grandson [not even a 50/50 bet according to Mary] John Mackenzie. I wonder how long we will have to wait for his story.<br />DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED except for the lack of moral judgement.<BR>Just hope L.

[grin] The attraction seemed to be explosive and her being so ordinary. But Wolf needed - Well you know.........[sure wish I coud plunk a smiley face here]<br />Much later it was her defense of Wolf and his son that triggered off a rape that was blamed on Wolf. Then it got a bit hairy when Mary was attacked. The attacker was driven off by Deputy Clay Armstrong. <br />Armstrong figures in a bit of harrasement because of Wolf's priors. Aha! then comes a third attack and Wolf is determined to bring down the perp.<br />We find out about his prior military training that just enhanced his Native American instincts [is that the right word?] and the knowledge causes awe and respect in Deputy Armstrong. You get the impression the Clay is dealing with a very dangerous man in Wolf Mackenzie. <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - definitely a great story but lacking in physical and mental morals. Ho!

I will admit that I am ashamed of the general run of the mill, so-called women of today.<br />These stories were originally written in the Desire series, therefore the length of the story was limited and not enough space given for expanding the story line.

But she did marry and made the best of the life she decided to live. And I can understand why she figured that Cade should give Addy and John's children to her.<br />Ah, therein begins a very well written story with a lot of great supporting characters. They make reading the story well worth it. I do not go for the heroine being older than her man but who am I to restrict the author.<br />Zoe had a lot of resentment and feelings of betrayal to work through but it did not stop her from being an excellent mother to the children -- ten year old Brodie -- six year old Will -- eight year old Holly and five year old Missy. Her fault, her secret should have been shared with Cade.<br />It appears that the one to be feared was elderly Aunt Latitia, John's aunt. She was adament about family raising the children.<br />Chalmer Winslow, a man of 65 years, was called \\"Pop\\" by everyone [I think] and was sheriff of Winterborn, Kansas - 1885.<BR>A gently scheming man who knew how to make people think that they had an idea first. He had an ingenious plan to get Cade and Zoe married.<br />Cade planned on riding out of Winterborn as soon as he found a family to take the children. Some how he kept getting delayed - but still figured he had time to leave before the killer, Hart McGill could track him down. A bounty hunters' life was very unstable.<br />You just fall in love with the children and Cade's capitulation to them and can understand his reawakened love for Zoe. I got the impression that he was shattered when Addy told him that Zoe had married. Loved the decision of the children to call Cade, \\"Uncle Pa\\".<br />I fell in love with the townspeople as they proved that they would be willing to protect their own. I chuckled when the older ladies started to carry guns and when Cade finally realized that the people were watching his back in anticipation of McGill's showing up. These people filled out the story with such gentle humor even Sawyer Gayford who wanted \\"credibility\\" after Laticia practically ran him down.<br />Cade was the town's famous native son and he lived up to both of his reputations as helper, caregiver and bounty hunter.<br />Ah, I don't want to give away all the little twists and turns that make this such an intigueing story but you will definitely love the way it ends.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and should be shared.	2003-01-31

What a midlife crisis. <br />Oh, Oh, enter Cedra [who kisses Lorrie's husband in fron of the whole family]she knows Tom as Buzz Turner.<br />You should love this story -- find out what kept Buzz away from home and family for 14 years and how they finally resolve the identity mix-up [and also what led to it].

In Connecticut in 1757 the settlement of Mystic was populated by Puritans.<br />Charity Frey was a widow with twin, nine year old sons and needed help on her farm, Mystic Ridge in order to keep the farm.<br />Rafe Trehearne was a prisoner going on the auction block. He looked so fierce that no one would bid on him. Charity made the one and only bid on him thereby making Amos Saybrook very angry.<br />Charity was shocked breathless at the wayward thoughts that entered her head at seeing his solid chest that was barely cover by the tattered shirt, so full of rents as leave his magnificent musculature exposed.<br />His golden eyes, so intensely alive were not the eyes of civilization but glowed with some deep, primitive emotion. [The first chapter alone is worth the price of the book]<br />Such passionate emotion that became explosive for Charity led her to make the wedding bargain. She was mildly shocked to be lusting after her bondsman.<br />It turns out that Raphael Gabriel Trehearne had also been a twin and carried such deep sorrow over the death of his twin and the horror and carnage of torture by the Iroquois and the war between England and France, that he was strangely disoriented by a blow to his head and ended up passing out before Charity could even get him home.<br />Their story of blossoming love keeps you spell bound throughout the whole book, along with the trials and tribulations of trying to make connection with the twins, Isaac and Benjamin.<br />I loved the prediction of the Pequot Indian, Blue Bonnet, a shaman and friend of Ghost Fox and Grey Owl. Keep an eye out for Tewah, the blood brother of Rafe who could become a dangerous enemy.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and definitely a keeper! Wheeee!	2003-01-21

I still find it hard to imagine 6 foot 4 inches tall. This is not a complaint just an observation.<br />Starting out with Jake Wolfe, the youngest at 30 something? then there is Eric, at 33, and brother Royce at 36 and Cameron, maybe 36? These brothers are following a 100 year old tradition in law enforcement. <br />Jake is an officer in Sprucewood, Pennsylvania and Eric works for the Philly police force. Royce is a sergeant in the Pennsylvania State Police near the northern border and Cameron, known as the &quot;Lone Wolfe&quot;, is a federal government special agent. This is the start of a good series?<br />Poor old Jake was starting to become a decent character but silly Sarah did invite him into her bed much too quick. And the fear she was living in just didn't cut it.<br />Ah well, the Desire series is supposed to be a light, short, fast story -- read to get the gist of the Wolfe family and pass it on -- not exciting enough to keep.  We will see about the other brothers stories.  most definitely a minus M.	2003-01-10

Of course Mack does not like the man. Then there is sixteen year old brother, Bob whom he advises, in a droll tone, to carry protection on his dates. And brother, Charles.<br />Natalie Brock is Vivian's best friend, and has a yen for Mack for years. She is also shocked to find out that the love of her high school life had gotten a long talk from Mack before going on a date. The young jock was killed shortly thereafter. And now Mack informs Natalie that her football hero only dated her on a bet.<br />Natalie also finds herself a bit jellous of Glenna, a free and willing woman that Mack sees when he needs a little free-for-all. Natalie doesn't know that Mack has been keeping his desire for her under strict control since she was seventeen and he was twenty-one.<br />Trouble was had by Natalie, Vivian and Mack [read it] and it took almost losing Natalie to bring Mack around and straighten out Vivian.<br />A great story - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- great addition to the Palmer collection.	2003-01-10

To this day, I find that so many of the younger generation could not survive if put into a similar situation.<br />Annika preferred her meat from a butcher rather than on the foot. I had to chuckle at her reaction to skinning a rabbit. It brought back memories.<br />She did show the inner strength of her mother in making the best of a situation and finally coming to grips with her lack of survival knowledge.<br />Buck Scott turned out to be a patient teacher [and in my mind] a loving, lovable man. The seduction scenes were not overly done and in keeping with the story.<br />Zach Elliot was back and as great as ever in his supporting, humorous role. Kase was stronger, of course he is 5 years older, and is presented as a more powerful, loving character. And his wonderful wife, Rosa, she is pregnant. Love her character.<br />I was really happy to see that Kase has taken on the role of collecting amd protecting the Buffalo.<br />These characters have such real depth that you wish you could go to Wyoming and visit them.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- should be listed as a keeper and a plus.	2003-01-05

Not really weak but not as powerful as I was expecting. But then he is still young.<br />Rosa was fascinating, her strength of character, or stubborness helped meld her character into one of beauty and tolerance. That is until she put aside her upbringing to surrender to hormones and hop into bed with Kase.  And why didn't she get pregnant? Especially after three or four tries?<br />I was glad to see Zach Elliot show up, as he proves to be a friend to Kase and Rosa. I thought sure he knew of the circumstances of Kase's birth.  Just goes to show that secrets do tend to destroy.<br />Do not forget Quentin Rawlins of Mountain Shadows ranch, he was a friend of Caleb's and hired Kase and interested in Rosa, also concerned about the prejudice she would encounter if she considered marrying a &quot;half-breed&quot;.<br />I was very disappointed to find out that Caleb and Analisa only had the one daughter.  For shame M. Landis. This was a great couple and deserved better, family wise.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed these couples but will pass them onto another reader.  Recommended --M Not to say that you should pass them up -- excellent read.	2003-01-04

What was his connection to Nicole?<br />Once again the big black dog, Wolf adds his humor to the situations and boy does he have sharp teeth. Go get 'em big fella!<br />Good moving pace - enough excitement to keep you wondering - although Silentmen talks too much for an undercover operation. And dippy do - PMS shows up - can't see where it enhances the story but that is just me. Hey guys, [intercourse] does not lead to love.<br />All in all, tolerable -- good while it lasts - recommended --M - needs more Indian potency.	2002-12-29

He is also a single father trying to provide for his children, baby Brynn and 4 year old Annabel Lee. He also has to deal with the unkind people who think the child is touched in the head. I enjoyed his friendship and jealousy of &quot;Laddie&quot;, a young seventeen year old miner who was interested in Kate.<br />I will not forget the scene when Kate runs away from the crying Brynn only to be accosted by a drunken miner. But she does go back and try again.  Apparently she has had no experience with children.  But they do muddle through.<br />The slowly evolving attraction between Trev and Kate is backdropped by the troubles in the silver mines and the troublemaker who are trying to get rid of Trev.<br />Kate eventually runs up against the men plotting Trev's downfall and risks her life to save little Annie and Brynn.<BR>What a wonderful connection developed between her and Trev's children.<br />I was most happy to find out about their extended family in the second book HIS UNEXPECTED WIFE.<br />Definitely recommended --M - one you will enjoy.	2002-12-24

But he did seem to make a snap judgement without looking into Dora's staying power.<br />It was fascinating the way her helping Emmet Meeks in his time of need, as St. Bride leaves the Island helps her growing and learning and secures her a place on St. Bride Island.<br />Now Grey St. Bride does not seem to know how to handle the attraction that he feels for Dora. It just isn't reasonable.<br />I loved the way she corralled the two women that were next in line to become brides. Poor St. Brides' theory of pairing up his men just wasn't working. There were choices to be had.<br />There was a certain amount of underlying humor in the way the brides finally made their choices.  I was sure rooting for Dora to bring Bertie over and low and behold didn't she show up. I about fell over when she kept running after Mouse. Love that man.<br />For all of Dora's plans - the bakery etc. - that fell through she did finally land her man. But surely could have done without the PMS. Am definitely decided that I do not want to experience any hurricane.  Brrrr!<br />Definitely recommended --M - great light read - most characters are so lovable.	2002-12-24

Actually in my own personal rating I gave it a 4 plus -- because of the humor involved with Wolf, a dog?<br />Loved the cover, the man representing Daniel Eagle seemed more realistic than most cover guys.<br />Most of these books seem to dwell more on falling in love [and not very convincingly] instead of the dangereous element that should be the driving force of Intrigue.<br />Daniel Eagle worked as an operative for the Gray Wolf Pack, apparently a very selective investigative agency. I am still intrigued with \\"Handler\\" and Burke Silentman and I hope the mystery deepens in further issues.<br />Can't say that I particularly like women like Hannah Jones who insist on helping and inadvertantly generally cause more problems. [I guess that is what is used to make a story work].<br />I thoroughly enjoy reading these stories but would not be tempted to keep them [not enough action]and PMS is for the emotionally starved.<br />Has Nelson Benally or his family been in any other books? There can't be that many Rez's in M. Thurlo area and many of her characters should show up in other books. It would be nice to keep bumping into known characters<br />Keep up the good work but make the villians a little more nasty and the main characters more positive about falling in love or lust with more self discipline. Premarital sex is just too common.<br />Recommended --M for a good read and animal lovers will love Wolf.	2002-12-24

Although most women may have been aware of sex, they were very circumspect in their deportment.  They may have thought about hoping in bed, but their fear of ostracism would have prevented most actions not to mention their folks probably would have killed them.<br />Very entertaining story and excellently written but just like all the others with premarital sex.

What intrigued me was the thought of a man losing his mistress - three at that.<br />Did not bother to pick the plot apart - just read for enjoyment and a change from the boring bed hoping of the contemporaries.<br />Did like the misguided loyality of Livinia Peyton to her sister but couldn't believe she was that dumb.  Comes with the age of the person I guess.<br />Ranson Baldwin for all of his investigations of Lord Hayley should have been a more dangerous character.  I think everyone loved to hate Lord Hayley and Thomas Carter and the truth behind this small fact. Women disappearing into slavery.<br />Jessica and Lavinia got off a lot better than they should -- the danger was present but didn't quite catch them in the plot -- still I did enjoy the general story.<br />Loved Drew's sense of humour -- <br />Do recommend for a light, easy read and a change of pace.	2002-09-05

I will assume that the fault may lie in what little info the co-ordinating editor gives the authors to work with in their stories.<br />I will still maintain that the more educated some people are the dumber they are. It seems that good old fashion common sense goes out the window when the mind is cluttered man induced premises.<br />Would have gotten Los castrated and strung up and TK should have been the one identified as the dead inmate, not just beaten up.

Even she couldn't figure out why Burke couldn't remember her.

Cherish is an angelic answer to his problem and he determines to return home sooner than expected. And he intends to keep his heart intact. No falling in love and giving any woman emotional power over him.<br />Except for those blasted Hurons slowing him down. The Frenchie, Pierre is one lovable character and puts Cherish at ease. It's not easy being seventeen in a land of men, and one needs a man's protection.<br />I could feel the freezing cold and exhustion of the characters as they arived home needing the help of Juice and True to make it inside. These two men turn out to be true friends.<br />The advent of Ada coming for her baby, Orah Delle and stalking Sloan was a bit wicked.

When she arrives in Hades she is carrying a lot of emotional garbage - mostly a bruised ego.<br />She meets Max Yearling, the sheriff of Hades and of course takes umbrage. Jimmy and Alison rope in Ike LeBlanc to restore Lily's confidence in herself through the cooking pot.

Max saves Lily from a bear which lead to other conflicts, etc.<br />Solutions: Get Lily to move to Hades and open a restaurant but she is determined to move back to Seattle.

Both Jimmy and Alison are younger than Lily who must be about 3 or 4 years older than Max?<BR>Now we need to see if Kevin Quintano, about 35, will move to Hades and hook up with June Yearling, about 20.  Of course there is the 18 year old Vanessa who has moved to Seattle. <br />More complications but not enough strong situations. Easy to read, fun to follow the foibles of the siblings and characters of Hades but ....... recommended but every woman and I use the term loosely has to hop in to bed instead of using her God given talent to woo her man [sorry but I find that in the end it becomes boring to the story] into commitment before surrendering her treasures.

I missed the vibrancy somewhere!<br />April Yearling comes to take care of her grandmother, Ursula, the one person who was always there for her and her siblings, Max and June.<br />April does discover that her Gran is as stubborn and willful as she is, which leads to some great dialogue. And some gentle matchmaking by Gran.<br />Dr. James Quintano has come to visit his sister Alison, married to Jean-Luc LeBlanc and to understand the attraction Hades, Alaska has for his sister.<br />Dr. Jimmy carries almost as much feeling of abandonment as April and has as much affection and appreciation for his brother Kevin as April has for her Gran. But for a rogue about town he acts pretty well laid back. Not much excitement there.<br />He begins to feel the pull of Hades as he becomes involved in helping Dr. Shayne Kerrigan and his sister, nurse, Alison. A stronger satisfaction than any gotten in Seattle.<br />But I didn't get the feeling of danger from the snowstorm scene and the resulting surrender to passion negated the intensity of the supposed danger.

Here we see and recognize the Notorious gunfighter.<br />On arriving in San Francisco, Marsh puts up at an elegant hotel, The Pacific Palace, owned by Quinn Devereux and his lovely talented wife, Meredith [from RAINBOW]. Quinn advises Marsh to see the only honest lawyer, a rarity in S. F., David Schuylar Scott to see about registering the title to the Glory Hole. [grin]<br />Scott informs Marsh about the Ice Queen, Catalina Hilliard, the owner of the Silver Slipper saloon across the street from the Glory Hole. She will not tolerate any competition and is dangerous to cross. She inadvertantly gets him shanghied and has to stop the deal.<br />Marsh proves just as dangerous to cross and now vows retribution on the Ice Queen and her saloon.  You won't believe what they do to gain the upper hand in business.<br />Cat asks her bartender and manager, Teddy, a hulk of a man, an ex-prizefighter, to send his cousin Hugh O'Connell over to the Glory Hole to apply for the job of bartender. Hugh needs a job to support his wife, Elizabeth and their five children, with another on the way.<br />Marsh visits the Sliver Slipper to scope out the competition and inadvertantly scares his timid, shy hostess, Molly. Causing Cat to descend upon them like an avenging mother hen.<br />Sparks ingnite and continue to torment Cat and Marsh throughout the whole book. But the hidden secrets of these two people make it next to impossible for them to find happiness. They both find it hard to accept or ask for help.<br />Playing a minor but very effective role through the book is a massive, ugly dog that Marsh names Winchester. Win is as private and alone as Marsh and the two slowly come to an understanding. <br />There is a secondary romance between Teddy and Molly that is very sweet and touching. Again a much older man than the young girl. Marsh is forty and Cat is, she thinks, either thirty-seven or thirty-eight -- both experienced in the ways of the world but not in the area of love.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED --M.

Most had more moral fear or moral guts than is being portrayed.<br />Plain old horny sex does not make a love story. I am glad that I can seperate a good story from the immoral ingredients [sex before marriage] used to sell a book. But authors in general follow the same old, same old - probably egged on by their editors.  There should be more to a story than plain old passion - which needs to be developed to love. Not used as a focus of the story. <br />A bit of action was incorporated in the shoot-out - finally a little fear of lose by Lucas and Dee's devastation as the lose of Angel Creek balanced out a bit of the guff.

And Tricia has been raising a son, Dillon Hawk, by herself.<br />You can imagine the sense of betrayal that Jesse felt when he found out that he was a father. There is so much misunderstanding and strong attraction between the two. And then they blow it. What would they do without all these condomns and pills. [sigh] <br />You would not believe where all the anger and hate stems from. I was pleasantly surprised with this neat twist. A really neat story except for the lack of maturity [or morality]but then hopefully that is the editors fault.<br />I will recommend this story for light reading -- you should enjoy it.

There could have been a little more danger presented but on the whole the story moved quite well.<br />Had a few chuckles when Doug Keelor decided to talk to Quinn.<br />Should have rounded out [or expanded on] the differences and angst presented between the CIA and the Navy a little more. They can get quite nasty.<br />Understand that I do not object the temptations that the characters go through but I detest the blazie attitude that sex will lead to love and commitment [a bad idea to project in this day and age - it don't happen that way] expecially as at the time the characters have sex they have no intentions of commitment.

One cannot deny the deep emotional scars he sustained as a child, and became a product of his father's neglect. [and you can't tell me this does not happen in this day and age.]<br />Cassie McClellan is a fiesty and endearing character. Not a mealy mouthed wimp always bemoaning her fate. She kept taking a couple of steps forward, both physically and emotionally, even in fear and trepidation. She is a good representative of \\"woman\\" and what she can accomplish with a loving spirit.<br />There always seems to be a great misunderstanding between \\"sex\\" and \\"love\\" and Gabriel did use force or \\"rape\\" [not true violence] but as Cassie asks, she [they - the women] are not given much choice in the matter in the 1800's [keep the day and age in perspective].  Today all you hear about is consentual sex scenes [my pet peeve]without commitment and that does not constitute love.<br />I Highly Recommend this book [and characters] You will enjoy the subtle shifts in emotion - even if they are not all spelled out, they can be felt. This is about a powerfully masculine man and a truly sensitive woman and their journey toward love [sex included]. This is not a story that leaves you feeling \\"ho-humm\\" they are at it again but a true progression of people with powerful emotions to resolve. CONGRATS! to S. James on a great story powerfully told.<br />DEFINITELY A KEEPER!	2002-04-23

Ah, don't miss this one, truly exceptional!<BR>There are really only three main characters and then others that weave in and out of the story.<br />Staff Sargent Riley Cooper: runs with his canine MP partner, Jasper. They patrol around the Military base, Fort Gordon, Georgia, especially at night. Riley hates entering a dark building at night since he had been wounded and almost died 10 years ago.<BR> Riley has volunteered to work on the weekends supervising youngsters that get into trouble one way or another and are assigned community service hours.<br />Liza Davis: a working mom and divorced from Keith Davis. She has an elevan year old son, a decent house and interfering relatives in the form of two men trying to run her and her sons' life. And fourteen years of guilt and sorrow to contend with. And now she has secrets to keep because of Keith.<BR> Gretchen, Liza's sister, has always been of Riley's side but loving and supportive of Liza's return to Georgia and their families.<br />Thomas James Davis: \\"TJ\\" has an attitude problem because of the divorce of his parents. He is led into trouble and of course Riley becomes the arresting officer and TJ is assigned to Riley's group of youngsters on work detail. He comes to Riley with a beligerent, smart-mouthed attitude which tones down until he starts seeing Riley as a threat to his dream of his parents' reuniting. He tries to cause trouble by repeating what he hears of his grandpas' bad-mouthing of Riley.<br />What makes the story so great is that you get pulled into the depth of sorrow felt by these two people and their aborted love affair.  It seems impossible that there can be any healing at all for Riley or Liza. Riley has such an emotional pain, lack of trust and a deep rooted hatred as to be almost crippling. [of course that didn't keep him from having affairs through the years].<BR> Liza has such guilt and sorrow at letting those two interfering men manipulate her that she is willing to take anything that Riley cares to dish out. She is willing to settle for an affair if she can't get forgiveness. Riley is willing only to offer an affair to get Liza out of his system and find peace.<br />The story is based on the old proven adage that sex before marriage [lack of morality] causes a lot of problems. Not in itself but because of [and immaturity]. Thanks Oprah, your program has shown this to be true so many times.<br />This story is Highly Recommended if you can stand the emotional tugs of sorrow for the characters. The sex scenes are kind of blah! But all in all this should be a keeper. Love the cover.	2002-04-15

He cut his eye teeth in the Motor City.  He was burned out. But that didn't mar his intuition.

When the storm takes the wind out of her sails she makes an almost decent crash landing.  At least they were both alive.  As her passenger was her responsibility she must see that they get out of the bush alive. Them bears not withstanding.<br />Some mixed up time was spent getting to the attraction they felt for one another. But Kelly kept pushing Jake away. Knowing that he would eventually leave. His life is based in Seattle.<br />Kelly sent Jake away twice [back to Seattle] and he still couldn't find another woman [not that they weren't trying]. It took an eagle to show him the way.<br />I can't believe all that angst but then I have never had to go that route, Kelly left me as confused as Jake. Never could understand why they use sex as a quick fix and then try to walk away.<br />Ah well, it had a satisfactory ending and I didn't have to plow through it.

It is always probable that these men have many unresolved issues that drive them to lead the life that they do.

Not all make it out of it into a more gentler way.<br />I followed Kate into falling in love with little Joey, Willy and that little rascal Lydia, but a yellow hound named Kitty?? [grin]<br />Lydia had a most effective way of handling Edgar Talmidge. Shame on the man!<br />I would like to see some pictures of the invasion [that is all I can call it] of Oklahoma but I have a sneaking suspicion that the men of that era were not very good looking  [according to our images nowadays].<br />No matter if you find drawbacks in the mental dynamics of our characters, you will love the story and its conclusion.<br />Highly Recommended and definitely a keeper - good for another reading down the road.	2002-03-11

Jess Logan has a deep sense of responsibility and family and wants to do all he can for his sisters' children.<br />I loved the way Maggie turned to her unknown Uncle Jess and gave him her unconditional love.  But Jess sure had a lot to learn about little Jimmy and ended up needing Sarah Wakefield to show him how to understand the little one.<br />Ah, but then Jess fell in lust with Sarah and began a slow burn for her. This caused oh, so many complications! He wasn't even aware when lust turned to love and poor Sarah was afraid of becoming a wanton with dire results.<br />Wonderful angles to the story to keep it interesting [especially Jess's little secret] and moved along with enough gentle tension that it became hard to put it down.<br />I am still a bit confused on how easily these characters give into temptation given the age they live in.  Not that it is an impossibility but I still think they had a much stronger moral fiber [or fear] than is portrayed.<br />Still a great story and will definitely recommend it for a good read.	2002-02-20

Wonderful characters but my puzzle begins with Serena Hull, who was born about the same year as Thad and now she is 25? and Alice was 5 or 6 before Thad was born.  Ah, well, I must admit that this intrigued me constantly but in no way lessened my enjoyment of the story.<br />I was sorry to find out that Jeremiah and Walks Dancing were killed - but happy to hear that Serena had a ranch to inherit. I loved meeting Cora Boult again - she has remained a true friend.<BR> <BR>It being a rough and uncertain life, why are the women afraid to learn to use firearms? Some turned out to be pretty good shots. They do show the inner strength that it took to last in the rough and tumble west.<br />Carleton showed the same reluctance to fall in love as his brother Ben but for different reasons.  These brothers made great heros and I look forward to some more of her books.<br />You should enjoy the books of these two brothers - &quot;Wildwood&quot; being #1	2002-01-22

She is overwhelmed to find out that her father had purchased a house from the widow, Mrs. Cora Boult - who becomes one of Jess's close friends.<br />Jess is determined to go with Ben when he leaves town to go talk to the Indian chief Black Eagle.  In getting clothes to ride in at the mercantile Jess meets Ella Kearney and her little daughter Alice, who is 5 or 6 years of age [this is pertinent only to time frame].  Ella is married, most happily, to Carleton Kearney, Ben's brother.<br />Ben Kearney, at 36, is afraid to love and Jess wants only to be a newspaper woman but their trying ride up into the mountains to Black Eagle's holdings starts their bonding and mutual admiration for each other.  Jess also meets Black Eagle's adopted daughter, Walks Dancing and they become friends. Jess soon learns that Ben's friend and compadre, Jeremiah Hull is enamored of Walks Dancing.<br />So there is a wedding July 24, 1868 and a birth March 14 1869 and a picture received in 1874 of 3 little girls - Serena, Jessie and Mary Irene - the tallest looked to be about 6 years old - the picture contained only one word &quot;Troublous&quot; [grin]!<br />Definitely recommended as an addition to your library - you shouldn't be disappointed.

Sorry - but this book is a plus better than just Excellent --<BR>This story is about more than just Shaw MacCade and Rebecca Raeburn.<br />There is the Raeburn family - with Grandma Jeanne Monro Campbell [sweet but strong enough] - her sons, Campbell and Quinn Raeburn [both stubborn and some ornery].<BR>Rebecca and Eve and her little son Jamie -- their brothers Corbett [who slides in and out of the picture], the 21 year old twins, Welsh and Drummond and the adopted brother Noah who is 16, near 200 pounds and has wheat yellow hair.<br />Now there is the MacCade family [grin] mama, Fiona [a true matriarch] and Murdoch MacCade [boy, what women have to put up with] - [had 12 children - I must of missed some]-- there was Will, Tom, Payton, Bruce, Laird [deceased] Shaw [maybe 27 years old, 180#, and 6 ft. tall], Leslie, Nigel [19] Ewen [16] and sister Katie married to Jake.  Leslie has a common law wife Janie and a daughter and 2 sons -- and a cousin, Bruce McDuff raised by the MacCades from a little sprout.  [I love family lines].<br />Angel Crossing helps perpitrate the feud begun so long ago yet nothing but misunderstandings come between Shaw and Becca.  Their love began when they were too young to know or understand love and its strengths. What do you suppose brought Shaw back after 4 years absence?? His deep seated love for Becca.<br />The way the story is developed and resolved is some times hilarious, always heart warming and proves that women hold families together. You can't help but become involved with these families and their squabbles, meaning that the author has achieved her goal in writing a truly memorable story - the trouble is you want more of their stories!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- definitely add this book to your library and reread it again and again!	2002-01-18

Although not as emotionaly intense as I would have liked --<BR>Jonathan seemed to be on a verge of an exhaustion breakdown which is certainly understandable when he has to fight the prejudice of a townspeople who didn't want change.  Not even to save their own lives.<br />And Ericka, a loving, steady young woman who wanted to be a good mama and whatever else to bring about family unity.  But why do  women worry about losing their identities? It certainly shows a lack of self confidence -- all they have to do is make their own identy within their realm of life.  And always add love. Ericka's greatest strength.<BR>I really loved her solution to the baby's problem with cows milk.<br />Altogether a perfectly satisfying story with great characters - would have like to hear of more interaction with the &quot;forbidden&quot; indians -- and somebody should have slapped the Mayor's wife a time or two but her character was so life like.	2002-01-12

Why has no one brought to light the wonderful characters in this book -- Are there follow-ups?<br />First we meet the brother Daniel [are these really Puritans?] and then through the entanglement of Millicent and Raleigh [cat and dog would you believe]and the threatening presence of Jacob [the bull] Ephraim &quot;Matt&quot; Mathiason, his two sons John and David and the nasty dominie.  His brothers Thomas, Robert and James and his wife Mary and daughter Hope.<br />[Listen to this description of Matt] ** He was a tall man, taller even than Daniel, with broad shoulders and a wide chest that tapered down to narrow hips and long, powerful legs. ** He was hatless, and his hair was so black that it glinted blue in the bright sunlight.  * * He limped, his left leg, apparently unable to bend at the knee, swung ackwardly as he moved. **<BR>His features could have graced a classical statue; his jaw and cheekbones had been chiseled by a master hand.** His eyes were deep set beneath straight, thick black brows.  The irises were a brilliant celestial blue, their lightness almost shocking against the sun-weathered swarthiness of his skin. The only note of disharmony was the scar, white and jagged, that sliced across his left cheek. ****<BR>Caroline's description is just as tantalizing. Both have been scarred by life and must make a strong emotional journey to each other to complete their family. <BR>Caroline being Matt's sister-in-law and Matt being soured on marriage cause many problems as Matt tries to control his growing lust for her. [His one besetting sin]<br />We fell in love with his family and his interaction with his sons, appreciating his deep love for his brothers and his healing brought about by the sass and impishness of Caroline.<BR>And his handling of the villians of the community with tact? and strength of character.<br />Highly Recommended and rates a rare 5 plus for excellence and is definitely a keeper for ourlibrary.	2002-01-10

I was disappointed in the series -- not that they weren't good enough to read.<br />It started out very good with Marydyth Hollenbeck being taken off to the Yuma prison by the lawman, Flynn O'Bannion.<BR>Her trials were enough to feed the hate she felt for the lawman and the story kept up a good pace and interest.<BR>Only her love for her daughter kept her sane, with the desire to return to Rachel.  Imagine her shock when she found out that Flynn O'Bannion was her daughter's guardian.   And that her daughter loved Unca' Flynn.<BR>I was also looking forward to more mention of the O'Bannion family -- What happened? Did they just disappear from his life?<br />But then the story seems to become a backdrop to their bed scenes -- no more anticipation - no more stirring passion -- ah well, another pleasant memory.<BR>You can only eat so many marshmellow before you become sick of them -- I guess that is what premarital sex has done for my reading tastes.<BR>I know that the author can write a very good story and I look forward to testing out her new ones.	2002-01-04

They placed a higher value on the respect they could command and on their own moral integrity than what is portrayed.<br />I believe that there was a greater fear of being thought a loose woman in that day and age than is portrayed by the heroines'.  The villianous female gets that role while the lead female gets away with it [in the name of love?].<br />Missy O'Bannion turned out to be a weaker character than I would have expected from her intoduction in &quot;Fearless Hearts&quot;.<br />I didn't really know what to expect from Brooks James character but I guess I had higher hopes that I realized from the twin brother of Bellami James.  I had hopes of a story of the brother, Rod James - but now I don't know if it would be such a good idea.<br />Violet [the little she cat] wasn't forceful enough to really cause trouble - she just prayed on Missy's insecurities.<br />Clell is a great supporting character and a welcome addition again. Now Logan needs a story - but???<br />Missy's injury balanced out the story but ----<br />I am glad I read it but I wouldn't want to read it again -- My criteria for a great story -- but then I have only found about 5 book in that catagory - the rest are just pleasant memories.	2002-01-03
