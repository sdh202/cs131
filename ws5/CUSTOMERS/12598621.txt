This is where it all began, one small book, supposedly marketed at pre-teens, released to an uncertain reception, not yet the worldwide hit it was destined to become. What worthy person can possibly be immune to the charm here? An orphan who is secretly heir to great powers, fame, fortune, escape into another, more interesting world... There are universal themes here, of course, heroism, villainy, mystery, a quest, a hidden inheritance, clandestine passages within a great foreboding castle, but there is also much that is new. J.K. Rowling's creation is so inventive and fun it's no wonder it's brought as much joy into the world as it has. I unapologetically love this book even though I'm twice the age of its supposed target audience, and I've read and re-read it since I first got it several years ago. I think Harry Potter, his friends, enemies, and their world are extraordinarily special, and I hope they entrance the minds and warm the hearts of readers for generations yet to come.	2005-10-14

Works better as a gosippy tell-all on the early lives of the players his brutal boot camp helped make famous than it does as anything else. At times Bolletteri's ego speaks a little too loudly and the pace of the book bogs down because of things like the printing of letters he wrote to his one-time students. The man many consider the greatest tennis coach of all time admits here that those who charged he pushed teenagers too far too fast in pursuit of champions, were probably right. He tells some funny stories, like one about Andre Agassi having a collection of empty whiskey bottles in his room, even though no one ever saw the teen drinking and he was monitered almost around the clock as part of the regimented curriculum: a mystery to this day. I used to imagine what it would be like at this famous camp but after reading this book I was so turned off by the military school-like atmosphere described that I'm glad imagining is all I ever did. I guess the jury will always be out on Nick Bollettieri's role in the rise to fame of so many of those who spent time at his Florida center. Some like Mary Pierce credit Bollettieri with making them their best; others downplay their former coach's contribution. This is Nick Bollettieri's chance to put in his two-cents worth, and he does...or maybe it's more like a dollar's worth.	2005-10-13

I figured a three-hundred-year-old book needed an updating in the promotions department and except for sex, booze sells the best when it comes to advertising. Seriously, though, Robinson Crusoe is a rich character study that sheds light on the outlook of the human mind of the period, on the world, on civilization's merits, on basic behavior when confronted with extraordinary circumstances for which nothing in life has prepared you. Its tale of one Englishman shipwrecked on an uncharted island greets something wistful inside us all, some part of us that longs to \\"get away from it all\\" and escape. Yet at the same time, this novel also provokes a fear reaction from within, as Crusoe lives out his and our own terror of abandonment, of total loss, of being forgotten. This is a classic novel that addresses ageless themes and wraps them in a story that's actually quite good for  its age and all location-imposed limitations.	2005-10-12

A young Viennese boy named Christoph happens to have the greatest composer who ever lived as a boarder in his mother's house. Set in 1822, this nice re-telling of factual events in the last year of Beethoven's life has introduced millions to the softer side of a musical god too often portrayed as stern and cold. Yes, there really was a Christoph, and Beethoven shared his home about the time of the composition of the Ninth Symphony, possibly humankind's musical high-point. In fact many real life occurrences came to pass just as Ms. Nichol's book tells. Beethoven Lives Upstairs is easy to read and hard to forget, and is a positive tale almost anyone should find likable.	2005-10-12

I've read a few books about Hitler, mainly because I was directed to do so in various classes, and of them all, this was the best. In dubbing Hitler : A Study in Tyranny the best, I mean it presented copious information (nicely backed up with an immense quantity of footnotes) and never strayed into validating the myths about its subject. One can read this abridgment of Bullock's work (I have never seen the long version) and come away reasonably well-informed about Hitler, his rise to power, the Second World War, and the Nazi regime with its various social misfits, failures, and  assorted lovers-of-self. Bullock is an admirable sort of historian, one who does not inject his own personality far into his material and does not speculate so much as simply present facts through as little cultural filter as possible.<br /><br />In my views, as the title of this review declared, Adolph Hitler is given more credit than he deserves. Yes, he is at times too readily written off as \\"a nut\\" and left at that, but just as often (and increasingly in this century) he is unfairly praised and credited with accomplishments that were not fully his own. He is usually described as, \\"Boy, he was evil, but he was a genius.\\" Was he? Was he truly?<br /><br />Not only was the hard-working German nation by 1933 on the path to an economic recovery of amazing scope, but the unrest of the 1920's with its inter-party feuding and Communist threat, was largely dissipating. Hitler is falsely believed in the popular view to have single-handedly set his nation on a path out of depression and into prosperity, while simultaneously quelling unrest and restoring order. In fact he had little to do with either, he came along at a time most propitious for him to make claims of responsibility for these things, but he did not author his (adopted) country's recovery.<br /><br />As for Hitler being \\" a genius\\" let's consider for a moment the deeds of this \\"strategic mastermind.\\"  Rather than containing his aggressions, Hitler took on virtually ALL the powers of Europe and eventually--in a fit of bad judgment so profound it should dispel his mystique right there-embroiled his nation in war with the United States, against whom the American people were not at war and were unlikely to be after the Pearl Harbor attack. Hitler allowed the British army to escape at Dunkirk, he invaded his own ally, the Soviet Union, he so centralized power within the military that on D-Day his generals were paralyzed without authority to act without the go-ahead from Berlin, and he set into motion such cruelties against his own citizens and the populations of those lands he occupied that any widespread support he might have gained was almost entirely lost to his armies.<br /><br />The man was not a military mastermind, not a political genius, and beyond any doubt not the savior of Germany, which he all-but destroyed in his less than dozen years as absolute ruler.  Hitler was the architect and inspiration for mass murder and more human misery and suffering than any one person the world had witnessed up to that time. Alan Bullock is to be praised for remembering all of these things and tossing the Hitler myth out of the window. I wish more people would read books like these before they go on perpetuating misinformation about an evil man they do not know as much about as they likely think they do.opted) country's recovery.

Set in England in the year before the outbreak of the First World War, this story concerns an anarchist named Felix, and his efforts to assassinate a Russian Prince, who is visiting England to cement a treaty of mutual protection in the event of hostilities with Germany. The anarchist, a Russian who has endured much injustice in his life (so much, in fact, he has somehow lost the capacity to feel fear in his plummet from idealistic pacifist to hardened killer)  is no purposeless psychopath.  Though he has come to regard himself as \\"lost\\" Felix holds out hope that if the chains of tyranny can be lifted from the peoples of Europe, then peace and goodness might rise. He sees no need for governments or for law. He feels humans can best direct themselves and authority is by definition corrupt. It is to the end of disrupting the treaty between the two powers, England and Russia, that Felix travels to London in 1914, intent on stopping the alliance and making war that much less attractive to the great powers. Opposing Felix is an English Earl named Walden, who, unknown to both men, has a unlikely mutual connection with Felix from the past-the Earl's wife. This novel moves at a brisk pace and flashes through the underworld of post-Edwardian London, as well as its halls of government. Winston Churchill is a minor figure in this book, although most others, including the memorable eighteen-year-old Charlotte Walden, at the time of the novel, supposedly a ninety-two-year-old  friend of Follette's, are fictional constructs. I found this novel skillfully rendered and immensely  enjoyable. It is possibly the best of the novels Ken Follette composed before his turned out his 1989 masterpiece: The Pillars of the Earth.	2005-10-12

I liked the descriptions of the raw, open country of Minnesota, and how the family faces it after a long journey from Sweden. This series can teach a lot about history and life in other times, and it also serves up some lessons in an admirably non-preachy manner. Kirsten was spunky and I hope readers noticed how hard children in the past worked compared to today. There wasn't always a lot of free time and people then were more appreciative of what they had. I like the American Girls book series (the endless merchandising of its themed products notwithstanding) and hope it stays popular for a long time.	2005-10-12

It's worse than his previous worst novel, Ancient Evenings, which single-handedly turned me off for years on all things Egyptian.<br /><br />No, I'm not some outraged evangelical railing at someone making use of \\"My Lord `n Savior,\\" I think Jesus is fair game and a fine topic for literature and speculation. But I'm not going to do as so many others seem willing to and automatically bestow praise on a book merely because it takes the sacred Jesus and casts him into the harsh light of modern judgment. In The Gospel According To The Son, Norman Mailer, proponent of the \\"non-fiction novel\\" (figure that one out) manages to make a good story dull and argumentative, drains all color and life from the plot, and delivers something that is SO dead on arrival it's unrecognizable as the tale of Jesus: a biography already filled with drama, betrayal, false arrest, torture, execution, and all the raw material of a gripping story. I've got to hand it to Mailer, not everyone could take a story ready-made for adaptation, all-but handed to him on a silver platter like the head of Saint John the Baptist, and then smash it down to third-rate nonsense. Here even the Devil was boring and it takes A LOT to ruin the best villain ever created. Mailer seemed to want to absent all vestiges of Christ from this little re-telling of the life of the historical man, Jesus of Nazareth, and I can actually respect that, but in rendering this material so skeptically humanistic as to be bland beyond tolerance puzzles me. I can't say I laughed out loud at the truly bad jokes slipped in here and there amid the equally execrable prose, but the line about \\"Peter was like a rock...he could be broken by a bigger rock...\\" elicited a genuine chuckle that something so lame made it past an editor.<br /><br />Right after he released this work back in the late `90's, I heard the author on NPR saying, in essence, \\"The Gospels are badly composed. There are many writers who could have written them better, and I am foremost among that number.\\" Mailer's ego knows no bounds and his trash talking was a little endearing. I just wish he was able to back it all up with a better book than this.<br /><br />The bottom line is this book blows. Skip it in favor of The Last Temptation of Christ, or read a good translation of the four Gospels.d.

Ninety-seven handy suggestions to improve the quality of your best friend's life with fun and games and the occasional good-spirited prank.<br /><br />My mom has this book and her kind-natured, if slightly dim three-year-old Chessie-Collie mix, Fergus, loves some of the suggestions in here. One of the ones I've tried with him is number eighty-two: slingshooting treats for him to catch using a plastic spoon as a catapult. Another one that seems particularly enjoyed is number eighteen: juggling. I've always been a good juggler and when I juggle things Fergus wants, like a trio of rolled-up socks or tennis balls, he goes NUTZ trying to leap up and get what I'm keeping right out of his reach. It's a hoot.<br /><br />The one suggestion that really tripped me out, though, and had me laughing was number thirty-two: \\"The Three Little Bears routine\\" which involves sneaking into your pet's bed and letting him catch you there for a change. Ha!!! Haven't tried that one yet but maybe I will when the time is right.

Harry Houdini, Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle, and others who gather to discuss famous paranormal cases. The men in the club ponder all the known facts about the matters and then offer their opinions as to the nature of the events. In some cases the noted gentlemen argue that the cases were fraud and in others that genuine preternatural forces were at work.<br /><br />The two incidents covered in Other Worlds were the infamous Bell Witch haunting of antebellum Tennessee, and a less famous but in some ways more shocking case--equally grounded in fact--of a New England family of the mid-1800's, whose home was seemingly invaded by a very creepy poltergeist phenomenon that begins making strange, eerie noises, moves on to rearranging furniture (while the family is IN the home) and from there proceeds from creating menacing \\"dolls\\" of each family member, twisted and shaped out of articles of the family's clothing. The case, inexplicably forgotten today except in the most scholarly of paranormal journals, reaches a crescendo I won't give away here but which surely, if true, reveals something stunning about what we hold to be reality.<br /><br />This book seems to have frustrated some because it does not conclusively debunk or confirm these cases, it tells the details as they are known, composes some possible explanations, and then lets the reader form her own views. I think many wanted a revelation along the lines of \\"this is how it happened\\". And of course that's impossible.<br /><br />This is a fun book for those who have an interest in events that fall outside what we like to feel are \\"everyday mundane\\" and its literary tone makes a nice touch considering the period the stories took place in.	2005-10-10

Hats off to John T. Cullen. The man came up with the brilliant idea of thoroughly researching the geography, culture, daily life, rules, laws, customs, sights, smells, sounds, textures, even, of ancient Rome, circa 150 AD, and then broke it down into session-sized chapters that let us take a highly well-imagined walking tour of the eternal city as it was in that time and place. It's true, as another reviewer pointed out, maps might have made a nice accompaniment to this book, but that's a minor aside.<br /><br />I loved this book! I loved the way Cullen takes his readers by the hand and directs them through a five-senses trip into the past. Not only does he describe the architecture and the major tourist sites (and occasionally take us into the future to tell what happened to the places and what is on the sites today) he invents incidents and people from the era to \\"flesh out\\" what life there was truly like. From a minor purse snatching, to gladiators in training, from lugubrious slaves about to be shipped off to the provinces, to aristocrats about official business, it is the people as well as the places that make this re-construction of the past so much fun...and so shocking! Ancient Rome was brutal by our modern standards. Death was everyplace, starvation was reality, poverty atrociously cruel, and famine, plague and war could be as close as the next season.<br /><br />Let's hope this is the first in a series and we will soon be visiting, say, Shakespeare's London, Ivan the Terrible's Moscow, Peking as it was during Marco Polo's (supposed) visit, or Philadelphia when Benjamin Franklin called that booming city home. This book is sheer pleasure....and it informs, too!	2005-10-08

Gorky Park, the opening book in a (to date) quartet of novels concerning a brilliant, socially disaffected detective from Moscow, is as much a tale of late Soviet life as it is a mystery and thriller. This novel begins after three bodies--two men and a woman, all of them young--are discovered in a melting snowbank outside one of Moscow's most popular theme parks. The bodies have been strategically mutilated so as to prevent identification and, despite any indications of a struggle, all three victims were shot at point blank range with a high powered handgun. From there, not only is identification made in a rather more swift fashion than the calculating killer imagined possible, but a complex plot involving government corruption, political dissidents, and the smuggling of one of the Soviet Union's most valued resources, is exposed. An edge of your seat drama, a sociological case study in dreary Soviet life, and a fine delving into the universal themes of human psychology, all set against the deadly, gripping cold of a Moscow winter. A really great book that starts off a really great series!	2005-10-08

I got the second one in 1996, and was impressed with it, too. But when I got this third book in the series, I noted that even as Gonick's artistic skill improves, his capacity to present interesting history diminishes. I was disappointed. Why did Larry Gonick, a very cool man with a brain the size of a planet (yes, Douglas Adams reference) choose to make those of us who had waited a third of our lives for this book have to wade thru his paying his dues to the \\"Europe bad/Africa And Asia Good\\" school of history? I have nothing negative to say about anyone who wishes to study the history of Asia or Africa and I would certainly have felt there was something wrong with this \\"History of the WORLD\\" book if it excluded Africa and Asia, but Mr. Gonick cannot right past slights against those regions by giving a disproportionate amount of ink to them in here. While he spent dozens and dozens of pages describing largely insignificant kingdoms in western Africa, he totally ignored the awesome Cahokia in North America, the Incas and Aztecs, the whole of Saxon England, the civilization the Vikings established from Russia to Greenland, the rebirth of Persia, the flowering of the Japanese nation, the migrations of the Polynesian people, the Silk Road, Irish monasticism that preserved whole classical libraries....etc etc etc etc etc. I know the author (a man I admire, don't get me wrong) would probably answer that there is only so much space in a book and he felt moved in HIS book that HE was writing to tell the stories HE did in the proportions HE chose and to write my own book if I disagreed, but I reserve the right as his faithful reader to say I was disappointed and feel this was by far the weakest in the series to date. So if I sound like I'm slamming this book and have a grudge, why did I give it four stars? Simple: it deserved them. I can't wait for volume four and hope it is the best of them all.

I am not a fan of anyone trying to mold history to fit modern attitudes and outlooks, be that person on the political right or political left. I believe ideally an historian should let the information pass through him or her and let as little of his or her personal views affect the telling as possible. That was absent here. This was theme-oriented reporting, and despite its occasional good points, that turned me off and deprived this book of my deepest respect.	2005-10-07

One poem comes early in the plot and represents a sort of nonchalance and even humor about death and the funeral industry; the second, though it arrives later, well within the more licentious Edwardian period, is utterly Victorian  in tone and already old fashioned when it is used.<br /><br />The first poem, irreverent to Victorian sensibilities, read:<br /><br />There was a young man at Nunhead<br />Who awoke in his coffin of lead,<br />`It is cosy enough,'<br />He remarked in a huff,<br />`But I wasn't aware I was dead.'<br /><br />The later, though more Victorian poem (used to mark the occasion of a young girl's tragic death) is:<br /><br />A lovely flower, soon snatched away,<br />  To bloom in realms divine,<br />Thousands will wish, at Judgment Day,<br />  Their lives were short as thine.<br /><br />With these two poems, inserted at differing points in the novel's tale, Chevalier infuses a lot of meaning. There was perhaps no other ten-year period in all of the twentieth century that saw a more abrupt transition in behavior, though that fact is little remembered today. As symbols for societal viewpoints, those poems are apt.<br /><br />Yes, this novel is about the changing of eras, about the transition in lives and society, and how society, here cast in microcosm, reacts to those changes. The main characters, wealthy, headstrong Maude, middle-class, dreamy and traditional Livy, and a young, charming cockney gravedigger boy called Simon, are metaphoric in their roles as representatives of their classes. Chevalier here is exploring  many things, from views on death, to the castes within a culture, to love as it is expressed between people in many roles. Social unrest, revolutionary movements such as the Suffragettes, much is compacted into Falling Angels' three-hundred pages.

The themes that fascinated the young Ellis are here, as are certain foreshadowings of later projects (the vampire cult of serial killers in one story could almost have been precursors of Patrick Bateman in American Psycho). A few of these tales are self-indulgent to the point of them nullifying any quality they possess because of their smothering shallowness, but there are several works here that stand out. Mostly these stories are character sketches and scenarios and lack anything like rigid plotlines. Fans of Bret Easton Ellis should enjoy these early writings but the average person is not going to feel comfortable with the subject matter or the way Ellis at this point of his career was given so much license to write whatever he felt.	2005-10-07

Two teenaged boys from different backgrounds---though both are Jewish, one is Chasidic and the other 'merely' strictly Orthodox---meet during a baseball game in which the brilliant son of a powerful Chasidic rebbe injures the Orthodox young man. An unlikely friendship develops between these two and from there we are introduced to those divergent cultures within Judaism that dwell close together within a community, but are separated by belief and custom almost to the point of mutual exclusion. The rebbe's son is a Talmudic scholar of rare giftedness, slated to succeed his dogmatic father at some future time. The other boy, who acts as our narrator, learns of his friend's wishes to become a Freudian psychologist and that his secret wish is to shun the leadership role for which he was born. This friendship survives great external hardships, clashes of belief (especially over the nascent state of Israel) and in the process of taking us on a carefully detailed tour of American Judaism circa 1948, it concludes with a positive ending that more or less justifies the trials at the heart of the story and also sets up for a welcome sequel.	2005-10-07

This is the volume in Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove quartet (or as it really should be said, the three books he wrote to tie into Lonesome Dove) that is earliest chronologically. In this fast-moving novel, the teenaged Gus and Call meet as Rangers on a Texas frontier overrun with menacing Comanches. Texas is at the time in its last years as a nation, before its inclusion into the American union, and the stoical Scottish born Call, and Augustus, the raconteur from Tennessee, have just met one another. Although their start was slightly rocky, the two are, by the beginning of this book, strong friends. The pair survive an early encounter with Comanche, enlist on a fortune seeker's adventure to take part of Mexico for himself, and wind up making a forced march across one of the driest, hottest, most savage places in North America, the Llano Escatado. The pair survive this ordeal (not a spoiler, to be alive for Lonesome Dove thirty years in the future, it's obvious they do) and then embark on a return journey even more perilous. This book has a shocker ending that I personally found hilarious, and is certainly one I doubt anyone could see coming.<br /><br />Dead Man's Walk stands on its own much better than did Comanche Moon, which is set about ten to twenty years after this volume, and is stronger in some ways than even Streets of Laredo, which wraps up the books nearly half a century after Dead Man's Walk concludes, but it is lacking through no fault of its own the familiar personalities of the Gus and Call we came to know in Lonesome Dove,. Here the two young men who will one day grow into the legendary pair, are just too raw to draw us in as completely as they do later on. There is also the matter of the author's inexplicable reworking of facts established elsewhere in the series' plot. I hate when he does that. He sacrifices continuity to push the story in the present volume along, and that's just a little weak. Dead Man's Walk is well worth reading and gives us a peek at the young Gus and Call (and a few others) that is enjoyable, but it and the other books in this quartet vary greatly in overall quality, with this being at the upper end, but nowhere nearly as good as Lonesome Dove.a peek at the young Gus and Call (and a few others) that is enjoyable, but it and the other books in this quartet vary greatly in overall quality, with this being at the upper end, but nowhere nearly as good as Lonesome Dove.	2005-10-06

Dr. Perricone's opinion that aging is a disease like any other (and therefore treatable)  is novel and not without some supporting evidence. His suggestions on starting young to keep your skin well-toned are invaluable. I read this book end to end and didn't find anything to really object to and there was a lot here that merits serious attention. This is a good program for maximizing what nature gave you and bettering it through all natural, non-cosmetic remedies. Whereas the typical American response to skin care has been \\"clean and cover\\" this shows it is possible to build a healthy foundation from within. The best book in this field on the market today.	2005-10-06

I read this a long time ago and it doesn't stick out as especially memorable. But I think I got it right.<br /><br />I just mainly remember reading this in one sitting in a school library and thinking it wasn't worth the massive hype it was getting. The Celestine Prophecy doesn't quite suck enough to be bad but I don't see how it acted as a spiritual guidebook to change anyone's life, either. It might've earned a third star except I was turned off by its heavy tone and by the way it took itself too seriously pretending to be much more than the old Saturday matinee brand of adventure quest in the jungle it really was.<br /><br />Bottom line? Not without some charm but not very good, either. Time invested on Redfield's novel could be better spent on other books or on doing something else.	2005-10-05

Before she was a Food Network favorite, this hard working former server and PR genius wrote up a number of recipes for genuinely appealing meals that could be prepared in a half-hour or less. She used to go to supermarkets and do demonstrations and sell her books that way. She's earned her current status as one of America's favorite cooking personalities and this book shows why. Unlike so many cookbooks, everything in here is kitchen-tested, it works, and it's absolutely worth the time it takes to make. Rachael Ray has kept food preparation simple and she really goes the extra mile in passing on her time saving tips on how to prepare fine meals in today's hurried world.

A picture of the natural grandeur of America's greatest cemetery would be an ideal accompaniment and give some idea of what I mean when I use words like \\"beautiful\\" in connection with a burial ground. This is an extraordinary book with an extraordinary subject. Spring Grove Cemetery and Arboretum has spent the past 160 years as one of the most carefully maintained and precisely landscaped spaces on planet earth. Yes, it is a cemetery, and yes, 'neath its verdant, tree-filled lawns the death do lie a-moldering and all that, but even laying aside the fact that among its miles and miles of roadways EVERY species of tree and shrub native to this section of North America may be found, it is still a place like no other. The architecture here has been known to make the living envy the dead. The famous lie here, the moneyed, the humble, the great and small. Spring Grove has tombs the like of which are not found anywhere else. Gothic mausoleums stand next to Victorian cenotaphs, Revolutionary War veterans lie next to Civil War generals, famed pioneers are in Spring Grove, and so are the movers and shakers of regional, national and international fame. Everyplace you look in this sprawling suburb of the dead (so vast it's a pleasure to get lost inside it) are scenes of nature's glory and humankind's creative genius. Forget modern memorial parks with their unifying themes of decoration and flat little \\"markers\\" atop carefully hidden graves, in Spring Grove death is not feared, it is glorified as only our mid-19th century forebears knew how.<br /><br />This cemetery and nature preserve is one of earth's treasure sites and this book tells its history and details its uniqueness for those far and wide.	2005-10-05

The only negative thing I might say about this record of the career of Ireland's latest gift to the world is that this documentary history might grow a bit heavy at times in the magnitude of its also being a tribute to U2. The hero worship is unhidden and laid on unapologetically thick. Also the photographs do tend to grow repetitive over time.

I found this book boring, the people populating it pompous and self-absorbed, and the author lacking in his talents. It's a book that will put you to sleep in the middle of the afternoon. I've heard the people that came of age in the 1970's described as part of the \\"Me Generation\\" and if this book describes their era's selfishness as it really was, then the moniker is fitting. Oh, and the part at the end where Emma wants a baby but not a man in her life, so she plans to get friendly with six strange men in one day...? As written that was just plain gross. As one friend of mine from the class where I encountered this book put it, \\"She wasn't hot enough to get away with that without it being disgusting.\\" I agree.<br /><br />Not just a bad novel, a distressingly icky one.	2005-10-05

I know many people truly love this book and I respect that. Give me a moment to tell what I wish had been different about it. What inspired me to read On The Day You Were Born was I was watching the DVD of the excellent production of Dr. Seuss' My Many Colored Days and saw a similar DVD of this advertised, so I went to the library and got the book for us--me and my cousin's pre-school aged son whom I was babysitting--to read. I had high hopes because the idea sounded so neat, but neither Tyler nor I were able to take it seriously for more than a moment. He said, \\"None of that happened!\\" And he was right. Whereas Debra Frasier could have made an interesting and true scientific story that fostered in a young mind the vast intricate panoply of life and the universe in its ongoing rhythms, she delivered something fluffy. She could have written about how on the day you were born the earth spun on it axis giving us daytime and nighttime, and the snows came farther down Mt Fuji, and salmon swam upstream on their return journey home, the grasses grew, comets raced around the solar system, and etc and it would have been an interesting account of a day's life on planet earth and in space. Ms. Frasier instead gave us an impossible fantasy about the whole planet being super-happy about the arrival of one more baby. Her claims that on the day you were born the fish and birds all got excited and told one another to look for you and the stars did dances and African animals marched in happy parades and other assorted impossible things, well, it missed the mark of fun fantasy and hit somewhere around \\"silly\\". I don't see this as a classic. The pictures were not that bright or interesting and the things the author claimed happened never did. While it's \\"all right\\" this book is not the great thing so many like to say it is.	2005-10-05

The author chose the device of an unknown manuscript that gave inside information on the events of nearly 200 years ago, and took on the stance that this was as much a mystery (a murder mystery, no less) as it was a series of possible supernatural events. I didn't find this novel scary, but I don't know if I was supposed to. My own view is that this notorious case of a haunting witnessed by hundreds (including Andrew Jackson, if legend is correct) contains some unexplained elements but is also one that has grown in the telling over the decades. No one theory covers all elements here but the one that comes closest involves knowing participation by some of the family involved in the supposed poltergeist phenomena that surrounded them. Whatever else this matter was, it became deadly serious and the patriarch of the family did wind up dead, just as the spirit of the \\"witch\\" prophesied. More disturbing, true to her word, the witch did appear and she laughed at him at his funeral, as his casket was being lowered into the grave. I have read quite a bit about this disturbing folk history and have heard everything advocated from demonic presences to straightforward trickery. One recent claim was that the girl at the heart of the case was being molested by her father, that the pranks she claimed were a haunting were a cry for help, and that she got her revenge by poisoning her father to death. That may well be. Whatever the explanations are, the Bell Witch of Tennessee certainly deserves to be kept alive in memory, and it makes for a titillating study of the unexplained.	2005-10-05

This book established him for the rest of his life as the most famous advocate of science in the English-speaking world, made him a household name and a huge figure in popular culture. He introduced if not \\"billions and billions\\" then certainly millions to some of science's heaviest concepts, and found a way to do it in terms that bored no one and set off imaginations in a positive way.<br /><br />In Cosmos, the earth is established as but one speck in a vast ocean of galactic one-ness and the mind is invited to open wide and ponder just how enormous everything that's out there is. Sagan explains supernovas and black holes, tackles concepts like time and the environment of planet earth. He lauds the ancient Greeks and champions the greatest minds of science. Through his personality and charisma and his contagious love for his work, Sagan accomplished a near-miracle and brought an audience to what in other hands might have been the driest topics imaginable.<br /><br />Cosmos is one of the best works of scientific non-fiction ever composed, and I hope it remains well-read into coming generations. I am old enough to remember when Sagan was a celebrated superstar in the late 1980's, parodied on comedy shows and a soft drink commercial, and it puzzles me how less than ten years after death robbed us of Carl Sagan, he is already slipping away from popular memory and how so few people under the age of about 20 even know who he is. I was having a conversation about this just last night with a high school senior I tutor. She is a bright girl, representative of her peers and social class, and yet when I mentioned this book and its author, she gave me a blank, \\"I've never heard of that.\\"<br /><br />I gave her my copy, but, boy, talk about feeling old...<br /><br />Anyway, I love this book, whole-heartedly recommend it, and I hope this review in some tiny way encourages its reading.	2005-10-04

This is a classic to get lost in, one for a chilly autumn afternoon, a cold winter night, a thundery spring morning, or a hot summer noon spent on a tree swing, the real world abandoned and King's Maine--a state where reality is at its thinnest--unfolding before your third eye. I think I picked this book up at just the right age, at the cusp of my teens, and for most of the next year King was my favorite pleasure reading. These are tales penned by the young Stephen King, a man not yet the world's best seller novelist and America's literary scaremeister, but just a twenty-something writer with a lot of good ideas. King wrote these short stories to pay the bills and make a name for himself, and out of those lean years came these stories which represent the most imaginative period of all King's writing. Not a bad tale in the bunch in Night Shift, and several rank among the greatest of the great. Words fail me here, so let me just tell anyone reading this that these are some seriously awesome tales!	2005-10-04

I loved reading about the towns and cities the Cronkite's visited, and I loved finding out about the natural features and the wildlife that called them all home.

But you know, as I sit here, I cannot think of much to add to what's already been written. I mean...if someone has already read The Hobbit, then she's already got an opinion. And if someone hasn't yet had the honor of being among those who have journeyed along with Bilbo through Middle Earth, then odds are she's been exposed to enough \\"Hobbit 101\\" background information on this famous subject to the point where anything I say is merely added noise. And if by some rare chance a person who has neither read The Hobbit nor knows details of it should locate this review, then is it really fair of me to say anything at all to influence how this potential reader might feel, or alter what he or she might know? Funny, but I've never felt this hesitation about any other work, and perhaps that says something unexpected about the sacredness of this book to me even now, a dozen years after I first spent a wonderful Saturday in June 1993 reading it. Maybe writing this review has been more of a voyage of discovery about myself and my regard for J.R.R. Tolkien, that right-wing, nature loving Oxford professor, whose life's work made him an icon among those of the political left. So let me end here by saying this: The Hobbit is a work of wondrous scope that was huge to me at one time in my life, is still of more importance than I knew a moment ago, and if you are about to read it for the first time or the thousandth, I hope you enjoy it as much as I always have.	2005-10-04

Though she is but a kitchen maid, Griet comes to the notice of the master painter who, while faithfully wed to his strict Catholic wife, becomes fascinated with her and makes her his model for his most famous work \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring.\\" This novel imagines the life history of the wistfully expressive girl in the painting, gives her a name and background, and then creates the circumstances under which she came to be in the portrait. This is an exercise in filling in the blanks in one of art's mysteries, and it is a skillful creation that sets the world of 17th century Holland back to life again more than three-hundred years after the original scenes of the book have passed.	2005-10-04

Everything I knew about it made me expect a silly, eye-batting trip into a fairy tale world of the Old South with its impossibly virtuous ladies, its foppish gentleman and grinning content slaves, and I was actually looking forward to making fun of the characters, story and author.<br /><br />I could NOT have been more wrong about this novel. Margaret Mitchell, I salute you!<br /><br />This is to American letters what Les Miserables is to France, or War And Peace is to Russia. Nowhere else are characters like these to be found or is the human spirit portrayed as so unconquerable. I fell in love with this book. From its would-be detractor I became its most vocal champion. I was stunned over and over at how inutterably magnificent this contribution to literary greatness was. As one reads along about the lives of these larger than life men and women all set against the backdrop of the fall of an entire civilization, any sensitive  person can only be compelled to acknowledge that there on the open page is a book that shall live in literary eternity.<br /><br />Of any work of fiction a person might feel compelled by \\"duty\\" to read at some point in a lifetime, Gone With The Wind deserves to be at the head of that list.	2005-10-04

The pieces Fred writes with such erudition might well offend many people, although I suspect most of those ostensibly offended will be outraged on someone else's behalf, rather than for any affront to their own interests. (\\"This stupid redneck can't say that about THEM!!! What's he think he is?!!\\")  Fred is that most dangerous of all creatures in this daunted age: a free thinker. There was a time when Americans championed that old adage, \\"I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend your right to say it.\\" That age has passed. I doubt I'd like Fred in person or that Fred would like me very much, but I read him virtually every week and more often than not I agree with his written views, or at the very least I come away feeling glad someone actually took on the issues he covers. This book takes many of Fred Reed's early online columns and puts them in print form. To those who might be put off of Nekkid in Austin because of things they've heard, I'll point out two things: 1) don't believe everything you hear, read the source for yourself, and 2) a differing viewpoint is not necessarily a bad thing. Has Fred ever ticked me off? Of course he has! He flirts with misogyny and his opinions on women come off as something from the pre-stone age. But when it comes to race, our failing national vigor, and the extinction of our great American libertarian principles in the face of an overbearing government, the man not only has the foresight to identify the roots of many of the pressing problems, he actually has the courage to take a rare public stand and exercise that most cherished of American ideals: speaking one's mind. Fred is a refreshingly dangerous philosopher and he gives free speech an intelligent, welcome workout. This book is good and many valid points are made within it. While one hears a lot of criticism of Fred Reed, one hears few cogent rebuttals. Nekkid in Austin is well worth the price.many valid points are made within it.

His characters are everywhere at once, somehow knowing everyone famous or important in history and managing to take part in or at least witness the most influential historical events of whatever time they're living in: they'll be a participant in the Boston Tea Party, Lexington and Concord and the Boston Massacre, all three, for example. This book is no exception and in fact set the rule among Jakes' later works. The writing here is adequate and this story does move along in a good way, but there is just so much silliness to this creation that it insults a person's intelligence. Why does Jakes feel the need to set his cast down right into major events? Why can't he write about people who merely lived through great times intead of being set down right in them? All that said, there's nothing really \\"harmful\\" about anything John Jakes writes, including The Bastard, just unrealistic. I'll show you what I mean. In this book we are expected to swallow the fact the fictional main character here is, though illegitimate, the heir to an English Duke (not a country squire or baronet or even an Earl, no, a DUKE), that he saves the life of Lafayette, that he beats up an Anglican Bishop, gets his teeth done by Paul Revere, befriends Samuel Adams, is personally known by name to George Washington, etc etc etc. Come ON! I know it's fiction, but too much tips the scales and reminds someone that they're reading a book, and that's something a writer wants his reader to forget. Disbelief must be suspended. Okay, so anyway, Jakes doesn't suck but he's not great, either. His works aren't bad stories but they're not convincing. If they give a few hours of escape they've done their job, but I wish this author had corrected a few flaws and improved himself and his books by so doing.ours of escape they've done their job, but I wish this author had corrected a few flaws and improved himself and his books by so doing.	2005-10-03

I grew up knowing of Mary Ingles, and even visiting some of the sites in southwestern Ohio that had to do with her story. (A Shawnee village to which she was taken sat on the grounds of today's Eden Park, above downtown Cincinnati; a second Ingles site is very close to Big Bone State Park, in Boone County, Kentucky.) I enjoyed this book, not only for the inspirational tale of a courageous human spirit, but also for its setting, which is the area around which I grew up. The Indian wars of the east were every bit as fiercely-waged as the wars of/against the Plains tribes several generations later, although not nearly as well known. Books like Follow the River serve to remind us of these earlier wars, a forgotten segment of American history.	2005-10-03

It's almost the author's fantasy scenario about extreme liberalism coming to dominance in the Catholic Church, right down to a Spanish Pope who wears business suits and who used to be a married husband and father. This far-fetched novel has so little material on which to construct a plot that Greeley concocts a love story around his Papal election politics. There is a reconciliation of a married couple on the outs, and a half-hearted aside into a secondary plotline about a man who wants to murder the next Pope. Oh, and Father Greeley drags his favorite Chicago Cardinal into the book to fill more pages and gives the poor old man a life and death personal crisis. This soap opera could have been a good short story but it's a dismal novel. Virgin And Martyr and Angels of September are better books by Andrew Greeley, and a few of the Blackie Ryan mysteries are fun, but White Smoke is a clunker.	2005-10-03

A funny book that is simultaneously smart satire and a giggly good tale. Since first reading this 1970's classic back in the mid-1990's, I've never looked at the number 42 the same way again. The story, which makes you feel like you're being let in on some secret 99.999999999% of the rest of humanity is not, begins when a mild-mannered Englishman named Arthur Dent wakes up to discover his house is about to be demolished to make way for a highway project. Well, he's understandably peeved about this but his friend and neighbor, Ford Prefect, cheers him up by letting him know his house doesn't really matter since the whole earth is about to be destroyed to make room for a construction project in space. Arthur's friend Ford is in fact an alien who was sent to earth to gain information on an updating of the planet's entry in that amazing tome of information The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. (The entry that used to cover earth in the Guide simply read: \\"Harmless.\\" In the updated edition, the earth's total entry had been changed to: \\"Mostly Harmless.\\") Arthur's life is saved after he exits the earth with his friend via a transportation device that makes the trip off-world \\"unpleasantly like being drunk\\" (\\"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?\\" \\"Ask a glass of water.\\") Arthur is cast back and forth across space and time, through a series of misadventures that make for grin-inducing fun for readers, and introduces them to a medley of species and planets, a cast of characters like a two-headed, three-armed President of the Galaxy, his girlfriend (whom Arthur once met at a party and with whom he \\"utterly failed to get off\\") and a robot mired in a perpetual state of paranoid depression. It is only through Hitchhikers that we come to learn that humans were only the third most intelligent beings on the late planet earth, behind white mice (who had been conducting psychological experiments on humans for centuries) and dolphins (a species that spent its time swimming in tropical oceans while humans went to work all day). This book is amusing and even at times hilarious and Douglas Adams was an imaginative joy of a man.cal oceans while humans went to work all day).

Although King of the Wind was more my favorite in the series, Misty was certainly the sweetest of all the novels. Here Misty, a young golden-coated foal whose mother is Phantom, a legendary wild pony from the herds that dwell off the Maryland and Virginia coast on a number of sea islands, is adopted by a brother and sister, who love her and raise her. The siblings, who live with their grandparents on a coastal farm, have a great life that any child would envy, and the sheer magic within this book used to set my young soul into heights of imagination. I wanted a pony like Misty, of course, any kid would, and when I finished this novel, I read its sequels and then read the series all over again: it was that good. This novel, and indeed the entire collection of Mrs. Henry's books, makes an excellent gift any young lover of books or horses is sure to appreciate.	2005-10-03

The story is uninteresting and disturbing and weak. The girl obviously confuses love with emotional need and what passes for affection between her and the sick man is misuse. This insipid tale of molestation and victimization didn't need to be told. I am not saying the subject matter isn't valid, only that as Oates presents it, it's pointless and blurred.

I've heard some people ooze praise about this book and some people revile it like it was an insult to them, personally. I read it and I found it harmless, even touching in a few places, but not life-changing and not a masterpiece. I think that IF we survive death in some manner, it's possible we are called upon to re-examine the life we lived, and possibly it might unfold in a way like this. I was interested enough in Eddie's life story and his experiences after physical death to read this slim book through. It wasn't great but it definitely wasn't bad. (Although the scene with the children who were war victims was a little morbid and hokey, in my opinion.) I suspect most people who don't expect too much from The Five People Who Meet In Heaven, will find it a resonably appealing read if they give it a chance.	2005-10-03

This tale of a group of German soldiers serving late on the western front during the First World War, is a horror story without equal. As young Paul, the central figure of the narrative, takes us through the series of deaths, woundings, desertions, sicknesses that compose the daily happenings of modern war, we come to fit personalities and biographies onto the sterile number rolls that tell a less human story of the conflict. To hear of the mud, rats, disease, death, pain of the front lines is different when one person--someone we like, trust, think well of--reports it to us. No sane man or woman would wish to be in the place Paul describes, and most especially we would not wish to send loved ones there. Perhaps, Remarque hoped, informing the public who were not in the trenches, or whose lives began after the conclusion of the war, about the madness of combat, he might, just perhaps, play some minute role in preventing a future conflict, or in saving a life.	2005-10-03

Ragtime is the story of various levels of American society in about the first decade of the 20th century, a period Doctorow dubs \\"The Age Of Ragtime\\" after the popularity of the music Scott Joplin and other composers are writing at this time. In this curious novel, we meet real and invented people interacting on a taut little stage. Here we find Harry Houdini, Evelyn Nesbit, Henry Ford, J.P. Morgan, Harry Thaw, Booker T. Washington and other famous and infamous men and women from this time, and we also meet some archetypal constructs known to us by such designations as \\"Father\\" \\"Younger Brother\\" \\"Mother\\" etc. There is the upper-class white family from New Rochelle, headed by an explorer father; there is the ambitious, hard working Jewish family, new to America's shores, headed by a kind-hearted man whose brain teems with ideas for inventions; and there is a black \\"family\\" composed of an unwed father and mother (a Ragtime pianist, and a young woman who is eventually taken in by the white family) and an infant son. The bulk of the story of Ragtime trickles through the lives of these people, and passes notoriously through passion-fueled murder, bigotry, accidental killings, social glory, revolutionary schemes, and acts of---justified?---terrorism. Ragtime moves so far away from the plot of its beginnings it is impossible to predict its destination, a reader merely hangs on for the bumpy, wavering ride through our American nation in its teenaged years.	2005-10-02

What is often forgotten about Stephen King's best book is that nowhere else in fiction is an alcoholic portrayed more realistically, and nowhere else is life for those who love that alcoholic shown with such gutsy, poignant, dead-on, hideous perfection. Those facts and those characters wed with a spectacular story of ghosts and evil, and that is why The Shining will outlive its contemporaries and still be read in a thousand years. The characters here live and breathe within our minds.<br /><br />Ten-thousand \\"serious\\" writers in more literary fields WISH they had the skill Maine's greatest writer does. No matter what genre he is writing in on any given day, King is one of the best writers ever to tell a tale. So read The Shining for whatever reason you wish, it's too great a book not to make your introduction, but keep an eye open for what I said about its characters. The story of a family and alcoholism is what raises this eerie novel to levels of surpassing greatness.	2005-10-02

Michael Palin's treks have taken him around the world but this journey through the Sahara seemed to bring something out in him I hadn't found in his other books. He described his lifelong fascination with the world of the desert and spoke of it with terminology that shrewdly built up an undercurrent of expectation that this was a dangrous undertaking. Life exists in the great African desert by balancing on a razor's edge, and Palin took us very close to that edge as he made his way from one side of this \\"living wasteland\\" to the other. He met desert dwellers whose lifestyle hadn't varied in millennia. He also met those who resided in cities whose seemingly tenuous hold was revealed as deception when one considers that some of those population centers have stood since the iron age. Palin passes through the sands on camel-back, on trucks, and on foot. He introduces us to the strange and the beautiful and the shocking alike. Whenever I read something like this I am always left struck in a child-like way by how vast and many-faceted our earth is. That I share the planet with terrain and cultures like those whose lands he passed through is shocking even though, of course, I \\"knew\\" that I did.<br /><br />Palin is a bold explorer and makes a fine guide to the most remote corners of this world. This may be his most intense and personally-meaningful expedition. I was left with the sense that he respected the Sahara as he had noplace else he'd ever gone.	2005-10-02

Maybe I should begin by getting that statement off my chest. It draws many of the characters from Lonesome Dove together and the stories McMurtry places them in are generally worthy of their greatness. But there were very discernable problems with this book beyond the flaws in the long story that made it the weakest volume of the Lonesome Dove series. What kept frustrating me was how the continuity was wrong. By this I mean facts that should have meshed instead contradicted one another between the various books in this quartet. That is just about unforgivable. I hate when authors do that because it weakens the reality of the novel and reveals it as \\"just a book\\". I could go on and say some more things here that are critical but the fact is, I did like Comanche Moon and was glad to spend time with those I got to know in the immeasurably superior Lonesome Dove.

It is a sad tale about a working class cleaning lady who comes to tidy the flat of a snobby rich society type, and though the kind-hearted, rough-spoken cleaning lady tries to be friendly, the snob only looks down on her and belittles her. We notice, as the employer does not, how hard the woman's life clearly is and catch signs that go missed by her self-important boss that the maid is in an abusive relationship. When one day the cleaning woman brings her employer a gift she thought might be appreciated--a small copper neo-modern peacock for a desk ornament--the employer does not try to conceal the contempt felt over the piece, which is clearly inferior to the refined tastes and artistic pretensions that have been cultivated over a lifetime. The unfeeling boss is heedless to the fact the item no doubt cost a lot in comparison to what the maid earned, and does not care how the rejection of the gift hurts the well-meaning woman. Shortly after this the maid is beaten to death by her violent boyfriend and the employer at last realizes regret over the reaction to the gift the maid got her.<br /><br />A sad, sad, sad, story!<br /><br />Fortunately the remainder of the tales in this collection are not quite so dreary. In one, a likable young professional woman is reading in a public place when some items of her clothing are stolen by a tall woman whom she sees hurrying away into a crowd. She is angered by this intrusion, and it leads on down the story to her involvement with an odd, charming man who connects back to her because of the incident of theft, which he claimed to witness. Eventually the woman is at the man's flat and as she begins looking around, she finds her missing possessions and realizes in a chilling \\"it's too late now\\" moment that the MAN was the thief, that he dresses as a woman to go out in public and commit his thefts--brilliant disguise!--and now she's, as it might be said, \\"in his clutches\\"...<br /><br />Another short story is about a woman in love with a married man. The man drags the reluctant young woman into a plot to murder his wife, so that they might be married. The woman neither agrees nor exactly recoils from the plot and after the woman is dead, she accepts her place as wife and stepmother but things are rather ruined and she never thinks of the man the same way again. Years pass, she gets older and is increasingly unhappy. She begins to grow paranoid that her husband is having an affair with a woman of roughly the same age she was when she and the man first met. She has some minor \\"accidents\\" come to pass around her and is terrified that she is marked for death. Though the husband tells her it's madness, of course he loves her, she is left a screaming wreck, utterly regretting the life her complicity has gotten for her.<br /><br />Probably the best mystery among these nine stories is about the apparent suicide of an elderly woman with a history of depression and past attempts on her own life. Shortly before her death, the old woman had taken to \\"interfering\\" as it is seen, between a controlling woman and the woman's rebellious teenaged daughter, whom the old woman had befriended and with whom she sympathized. Though there is a suicide note definitely written by the old woman, a police inspector is not certain she was not murdered. His colleagues question how it could be murder when there is a note left behind and the signs of suicide are so clear. The case is investigated and the facts eventually comes to light as to whether the death was in fact suicide, or murder.<br /><br />Ruth Rendell's best work of all are the stories in The Copper Peacock.now she's, as it might be said, \\"in his clutches\\"... <br /> <br />Another short story is about a woman in love with a married man.

But I think the actual book itself is so heavy and so full of genuinely mercenary and dishonorable people that it makes you want to hold it at arm's length.

Rather than containing the universal appeal of great tales, these seem like an author pushing the collective fear button as it existed in the early 1980's. His interchangable, immediately forgettable characters move blindly through Barker-by-the-numbers stories about leftist horror themes and alienate rather than welcome a reader. These read a lot like campy horror comics minus the illustrations. Yes, I know he's hailed as the most revolutionary genius in horror in fifty years, but I think his stories lack anything beyond momentary shock value.  Try this: read Barker and then after a month try to remember the details of his stories. When you can't do that, then try to name five of his characters. It's hard, isn't it? The characters get lost in the stories and the stories get spat out of the mind almost upon completion.

There is a lot of sibling rivalry here and some of it has foundations in real issues. I think the way Caroline is pampered and Wheezy is made out to be very boy-like (including the way her family treats her like a boy half the time giving her the harder jobs cause Caroline is delicate) would have been enough to sow discord between any sisters. This isn't much of a feel-good novel and it's pretty realistic in terms of how real life might have come out, too, with its separation and eventual happiness discovered only in a self-identity made far away from family and the places of the past. It reminds me slightly of Willa Cather's stories. This is a classic and probably deserves to be one, but it definitely goes back to what I often say about novels penned for the youth market, and that is that these are among the best books of all.	2005-09-30

I'm not sure if there is exactly the right description in literature for what Byatt aimed for here, but I think that analogy works. Byatt hoped, I believe, to cement her stories to Matisse in such a way that her words and these tales would represent in image the vivid colors and expression of Matisse's paintings. None of these three stories really gripped me or lingers well in my memory. I think it's fair to say Byatt was hoping to cast her female characters' views on life as a surrogate for how art itself might be viewed as a reflection of human experience.	2005-09-30

In this freakishly hard winter a \\"hundred year's winter\\" the family lives in town and twists staw to burn for warmth. The trains canot reach town, so there is no meat, no fuel, no supplies of any nature coming in. The settlers in DeSmet, South Dakota, as across thousands of square miles of the US heartland, are on their own. Page after page of grueling hardship is carefully related by Laura, still obviously moved by her plight even at a lifetime's distance from this disaster. The highpoint of this novel comes when Almanzo Wilder and another local young man called Cap Garland make a daring trek across the plains to try to reach a rumored source of wheat, and return with it before before the next blizzard comes. For them to be stuck on the prairie during a blizzard is a sure death sentence. Few  obstacles to human proposerity exist in this world greater than the grip of a hard winter. There is a feel here in this book of being under seige, and the winter is itself somewhat suggestive of a foreign army enclosing the people of Laura's circle, and threatening their sanity, well-being, and their very lives.	2005-09-29

That Thomas Robert Malthus was a cleric might startle some readers, who could look on his pessimism as something that is more typical of a man of hard, God-less science. Malthus was clearly, once one examines deep within the heart of his treatise on overpopulation, a theist, and a hard-hearted \\"God Disposes\\" sort of one at that. Underneath everything, we can sense Malthus' view being, \\"ultimately what does this brief, cluttered, hopeless world matter next to eternal life in Heaven?\\" Malthus' statements about the human race breeding past its ability to feed itself, have merit, but he failed to take into account the capacity of science to be humanity's deliverer. Revolutions in agriculture, medicine, social health, as well as many other fields, not excluding simple advances in birth control, have to an extent nullified the ABSOLUTE nature of Thomas Malthus' ideas, and instead, alas, made them true primarily in the 21st century for the Third World alone. Malthus was a man both in and ahead of his time--in it because he had but to open his eyes and see starvation and orphaned children, poverty and overcrowding in the slums, and ahead of his time in that he looked forward and forecast a dire warning to the world of a time when the horrors of this state might over-sweep civilization and strangle it to death with numbers alone. Malthus was a cruel man on one hand, advocating the selective starvation of a segment of society. He totally opposed any form of welfare, charity or aid to those who could not contribute to their own upkeep. Those types, he argued, decayed human society and lead it closer to the nightmare state he detailed in his work. He cited wars, plagues, famines, as servants of humanity, in that they thinned the ranks and tried to keep us from reproducing ourselves into extinction. Malthus' fearful prognostications might yet see its consummation one day and some may say that in various parts of the world we are already seeing it, but I take the stance that if our species has one great gift, it is its intellect, and that intellect might-if we are motivated by conditions made intolerable--yet serve to deliver us from even our self-created scenarios of mad destruction.ur species has one great gift, it is its intellect, and that intellect might-if we are motivated by conditions made intolerable--yet serve to deliver us from even our self-created scenarios of mad destruction.	2005-09-29

The town of DeSmet has boomed and grown and slowed down by this time and life has found comfortable rhythms. Pa is a prosperous farmer and townsman, Laura is a teacher, and Almanzo is a respected businessman who also farms a holding on the town's edge. One can tell this novel meant a lot personally to Laura and that she enjoyed re-visiting these \\"happy, golden years\\" in her own life and sharing them with us.

Doctorow's novels have taken us from the post-Civil War 1870's (The Waterworks) to the merry-go-round of early 1900's (Ragtime) and in Loon Lake, the stark world of America in the Great Depression of the 1930's, gets this author's masterful touch. This novel shows yet again how it is possible for a great writer to weave a novel out of the tiniest of circumstances. In this case, a young man from New Jersey has set off during the worst of the depression to walk the railroad tracks and seek a better life. He hears a train coming, so he steps off and is passed by a number of luxurious private railroad cars, one of which contains a beautiful, naked woman standing in front of a mirror, holding up a dress to her body. The young man elects to follow this train and winds up at Loon Lake, the vast private estate of one of the wealthiest men in the east. The young man spends some time on this estate amid the gathering of peculiar characters there-the magnet's aviatrix wife, an obese writer and would-be political assassin--and finally decides to head west. He steals a car from the billionaire who owns Loon Lake, and agrees to give a ride to a gangster's girlfriend, the woman he'd seen that night, who is trying to evade her violent criminal lover. The pair head to Indiana and settle in a factory town literally owned, brick by brick, by the industrialist whose east coast estate they'd fled. There the main character gets a job and becomes embroiled in a union versus management conflict that sets his life off in an incredible direction. The fall and rise story of the ambitious, brave-hearted young man told of in Loon Lake is little short of a metaphor for the American dream.	2005-09-29

His loyalty was always first and foremost to himself and his own glorification, secondly to science, third to whatever cause was allowing him the supplies to continue his self-edifying work. There is no doubt von Braun was instrumental to the success of the American space program and because of the edge he gave the Americans in the Cold War, it might be argued he atoned for his deeds as one of Hitler's top scientists, but the facts also show he was someone who had virtually ZERO regard for human life (except his own) and was gladly advocating suicide misisons for test pilots, well into his time as a US agent. I'd recommend this book, forewarded by former Senator John Glenn, to anyone who wanted to learn more about Wenher von Braun, the Nazi's advanced weapons labs, or the US space race.	2005-09-29

Although LIW went on to writer several more titles in her Little House series, this book marks the family's arrival in DeSmet, South Dakota, where, despite Charles Ingall's occasional wishes to continue west to the Oregon country, Pa, Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, Grace, and their bulldog, Jack (for sure one of the most faithful four-legged friends in all of literature) settle a government claim for 160 acres, and build a house in the growing frontier town. The Ingalls family had not fared well during its sojourn in Minnesota, having been hit by a plague of grasshoppers that destroyed the bumper crops Charles had been heavily counting on, and though Laura, by now in her early teens, cheerfully describes this relocation, one can read between the lines and feel the disappointment that was there. This is not the best book in the Little House series, but because it bridges the years between the trilogy that described Laura's childhood, and the books that came later to take Laura into marriage and adulthood, it is an important one. The rigors of farm life, amid the wild west, railroad men, and a frontier boomtown are well told. And then there is a goodbye to an old companion here. Anyone who is able to bid Jack a dry-eyed farewell has no heart. The goodbye to a dog as loyal, bright and brave in reality as any canine in fiction ever was, should bring tears to any child or woman reading this and probably has done-in more men through the years than would comfortably admit.	2005-09-29

As this novel of life in growing DeSmet the spring and summer after the long winter shows, Laura at age fifteen was already in possession of a license to teach school, and she was being courted by a man well into his twenties. I think just how young fifteen is escaped me back during my first reading when I was nine. This book tells about Mary's preparations for enrollment at a college for the blind, about Laura's becoming a teacher, about the boon to the family well-being the acquisition of a kitten is, and as always is the case in the Little House books, it charms us with its positive reflection of life in frontier America.	2005-09-29

As I see it, this collection of photos has virtually nothing to do with politics of any sort and has everything to do with the celebration of America's families. Inside this wonderful 225-pages worth of images are Americans of all ages, races, locations and surely political views. The one thing that unites the subjects of these color and black and white, modern and occasionally vintage photos is the fact that they are Americans and part of a family. There are heartwarming snapshots of small children, and formal portraits of adult family members, too. There are candid shots of young people playing, and families being together at work, church and around the dinner table. There are so many images of obvious love that I can't see how anyone would find this controversial. I think this work should appeal to people from coast to coast and stand as a festival of family togetherness.	2005-09-29

I suspect that's true, but in the case of this book, it is beyond all doubt what happened. Rose took her mother's raw diary and prepared it for publication, and the product is the book On The Way Home, which tells of the journey Rose and her parents made in 1894, from DeSmet, South Dakota, setting for the final half of the Little House books, to the Ozark country, where the family would spend the next sixty years. The description is unsentimental, not glamorized (as it tends to be--for the sake of betterment--in the other books) and it paints a portrait of the difficult traveler's life on the by-then crowded prairie overrun with east-central European immigrants, many of whom being exactly the type portrayed in novels such as My Antonia. The Wilder family completes its draining re-location by covered wagon and arrives in Missouri, a state so much a promised land to them that a reader cannot help but share their relief when they safely arrive.	2005-09-29

Laura tells of the trek across the central US, over the frozen Mississippi River, past mile after mile of empty spaces and tall grasses, till they reached the site where Pa decided they would stay. The family builds a log cabin by hand and digs a well, plants gardens and Pa hunts jackrabbits under the huge blue sky. There are neighbors, the Scotts, who come from Indiana, and the \\"Tennessee Wildcat' Mr. Edwards, who is an especially good friend to the Ingalls family and the girls. The best parts of this novel were the ones that had to do with Jack, the family's bulldog, who was fierce and fearless in his defense of his loved ones. A close second to the stories of Jack is the tale of the Christmas spent in the cabin, when floods made a visit from Mr. Edwards--and Santa--unlikely...and yet an improbable miracle comes to pass. The stories here are at once heartwarming and informative, and the segments that tell of Indian relations (especially if one looks outside the novel at the events going on in that time and place) make for an invalubale first-hand view of an era in US history typically described only by those who were never there.	2005-09-28

Living at first in a dugout home set right into the very banks of a small creek, the Ingalls live in this more settled place than they'd known in their past, and the girls begin school, the family goes to church, and Ma plans a party. In short, life is more \\"normal\\" for this pioneer clan than they had ever known. In this book we first meet the uber-brat Nellie Olsen, and nowhere else in the series does it seem the Ingalls' family fortunes have the chance to rise so high. This is the middle book in the series and the final volume before the family settles in the South Dakota town of DeSmet, where all the remaining books describing Laura's youth are thereafter set. A different change of pace from the previous Little House books, but still highly charming in its own right.	2005-09-28

This is the dumbest novel I've ever seen get hailed by so many people as great. This is the dumbest novel ever written by someone who didn't later wind up \\"working\\" as a college English professor. I didn't like Sheila, her mental mother, or her wild roommate. The doctor character who in the film version beds poor, pure Sheila, the nice conflicted Jewish girl really gave me the willies, and his presence was lacking in this hideous novel. I mean it. This book sucks. I'd rather go to the dentist than re-read Sheila Levine is Dead and Living in New York. To use this hideous thing for cat litter box paper is doing a cat a disservice.

This book breaks with the pattern of the rest of the series and tells a story not of Laura, herself, but of a year in the life of her future husband, Almanzo Wilder, as his family farms a proposerous holding near Malone, New York. Almanzo's eastern roots register more a familiar setting to me than the wilds of the Great Plains. I loved reading about Almanzo's adventures on the farm, raising Morgan horses, riding a sleigh thru the great New York winters, cutting ice on the frozen rivers, going to school, doing chores, attending fairs and church socials, having an upbringing every bit as sound and eventful with its established roots as young Laura Ingalls had a few years later out in the Wisconsin forest and the Kansas plains.

Washington the farmer, the soldier, the husband, the businessman and the not always accepted suitor are all here. Not once anyplace does Martin succumb to any temptation to deliver the Washington of myth, and his book--and its reader--are better for it. The only thing I might note here is that this book devotes uneven lengths of time to various aspects of Washington's life. I won't say this is wrong, because Martin was at liberty to divide his story however he wished. But I was left wondering why scant pages were dedicated to the Washington Presidency, whereas other epochs in the man's life got much more attention. The people and the world of eighteenth-century America are nowhere in fiction described so skillfully or so three-dimensionally as in the hands of writer William Martin, who did a very good job with a difficult subject in Citizen Washington.	2005-09-28

I know I leaped into these books and loved every second of reading them. The setting of isolation in a vast northern woods where a family could live off the land in their little log cabin sent my imagination flaring. I read and re-read each chapter in the life story of Laura Ingalls and her sisters and parents, and bulldog Jack, as they lived in Wisconsin at a time when panthers and bears still roamed the wild forests. The most magical parts to this novel were the ones about Christmas and also about family gatherings. Even though people then had less in the way of material things than we do now, they seemed happier and richer in their joy at what they did possess. I think that's a secret to life that has been lost in our own time. Hopefully anyone who has ever wanted to read this novel has gotten the chance. It's that special, in my view.	2005-09-28

I think that's a valid point, to an extent. I can see how this book set imaginations going and gave hope to the downtrodden, much in a way that the arrival of Methodism in the 18th century gave cause for optimism among the working classes of England. I think given human nature, something like a Communist experiment was unavoidable. Communism had high ideals but human greed and sadism condemned it to failure, and now it should be abandoned and laid aside as a relic of the past. Communism studied as yet another misapplied utopian blueprint is a fine subject to read about, but the real tragedy is that a billion and a quarter human beings are still shackled in the year 2005 to the chains of this hopeless, fatally handicapped nineteenth-century hypothesis.	2005-09-26

(Although I doubt few will ever read it.) Palladino cites the social injustices teens face, reminds us how short a time the word \\"teenager\\" has been in our cultural lexicon, and studies the way teens have thought, spoken, acted, and influenced popular society throughout time. This is an unexpectedly scholarly yet interesting book that takes the time to go out on a limb and side with the rebellious youth among us, and also to speculate on how the teen years are changing and how they might ultimately be in the near future.

It's true I had never heard of Billy Sunday before that but every time I hear a reference to him now, I immediately think of this book and that sunny afternoon in 1993.<br /><br />\\"Sunday\\" was a man who began life as a baseball player and remembered his days in that sport and the lessons it taught him about how to work a crowd. This backwoods Hellfire preacher was one of the most famous of all living Americans in his day and he headed open-air revivals the faithful would drive for days on end to reach. His charisma, forcefulness and dyed-in-the-wool sense of conviction gave him a powerful energy that sparked the interest of millions. One thing that I most remember about this brief biography of the first of the great broadcast media evangelists is the tone of respect it has for its subject. In fact it had so much reverence for Billy Sunday that I felt like maybe its lack of impartiality somewhat hamstrung its impartial reporting of the facts. So if anyone wants a celebration of Billy Sunday, this is the book, but for a warts and all portrait, I'd investigate what else is out there.<br /><br />(Thanks, Mrs. Glenn!)	2005-09-26

His prose reads more like that of Henry James than the pulp fiction hacks too often associated with horror stories. With Straub, sentences never end in prepositions, tenses are never mixed, and (sometimes unfortunately) one word is never used where ten might work as well. One other thing I noticed years ago is that Straub also portrays female characters more realistically than any other male writer I can think of off the top of my head.<br /><br />I really like Floating Dragon and have read it cover to cover at least three times over the last decade, and also will pick it up a couple times a year and open it at random just to let its vibe affect me, as it is guaranteed to do to anyone. The story here of a wealthy Connecticut suburb called Hampstead, which lies off Long Island Sound, and the series of serial murders with which it is beset with a frequency of about one in every two generations, is augmented by the release of a top secret chemical a local firm is developing on behalf of the Department of Defense. The chemical agent, which escapes to pass directly over the little town of Hampstead, causes severe hallucinations in anyone exposed to it, death in some cases, and in a small percentage of those deaths, the flesh of the afflicted seems to melt from the bone and become a fluffy, slimy ooze. Pretty gory!<br /><br />In Floating Dragon, the scene is set in the summer of 1980 for a cast of literally a couple thousand characters to survive the presence of both the chemical and the return of a supernatural killer who possesses his chosen agent and then proceeds to become a ripper-killer who leaves his horrendously mutilated victims behind, one after another. A small group, more aware than their fellow townspeople of the dual threats they are all facing, join to find out more about the evils besieging their community. Their research locates records of similar killings from the early 19th century through the 1890's, the 1920's, and the 1950's. They work as one to foil the plan to destroy Hampstead, Connecticut, and around them Straub tells an extended tale of insanity, murder, tragedy and darkness on a scale the likes of which few writers have ever attempted.<br /><br />This is a dreamy, uneasy, yet pleasing novel that exceeds its author's hopes and successfully brings together a plot of staggering dimensions.lings from the early 19th century through the 1890's, the 1920's, and the 1950's.

In my view that makes it even more likable. This is a comedic record of the life of a deeply flawed, fantasy-prone, sociopathic woman in the business world whose ambition and willingness to do anything, sell out any friend, rival or co-worker, flatter any boss or hatch any plot to get ahead is the darkly funny antidote to the increasingly silly misadventures of a certain diarist named Jones.

Still, dry is not always a put-down, and I recognize that this study of the Arab peoples with concentration placed on the time of Muhammad forward, does deliver as promised the nearly complete history of the Arab culture. I came away more familiar with Arab self-identity than I had been when I began the project, and that was the goal. Whether one loathes Arabs or regards them with fascination, it must be admitted that their contributions earn them a place among the top civilizations on this planet.	2005-09-26

There is tremendous bias here. No real scholarly authority exists among these people to give them the capacity to state the claims they do. They grasp at any straw in order to speak ill of the historicity of the Bible. This is a group who examined the entire canon of the four Gospels and claimed that only \\"Our Father\\" is likely a valid quote of Jesus'. Those involved in the creation of this book are self-important liberal theologians making a name for themselves and grinding an ax against the conservatives in Christianity they do not like. If they had some case to make, I'd respect it, but there isn't one here, so I dismiss this as bad research and a lot of personal, angry opinion. In short, don't waste your time.	2005-09-26

The 9th century female Pope created here was a Medieval version of an urban legend that did not even come to exist until centuries after the period in which this novel is set. As long as it's kept in mind that this is fiction based on baudy myth, then it's a fine sort of book, because the author, Donna Cross, is to be commended for having created a Medieval setting rich in detail, a story that is exciting and involving, and populated it all with a good bunch of characters. The journey of Joan from a Saxon England still slightly leaning in the backwoods toward paganism, to Rome where disguised as \\"Brother John\\" her learning, intellect and medical skills gain her Papal notice, is sure to be a crowd pleaser. I liked this novel and say that now even after I started off with a prejudice against it because of the subject matter of a female Pope: a topic sometimes self-servingly misused by the ill-informed in our own times.	2005-09-26

The city is filled with limbless ex-soldiers, begging on the streets, shooting morphine into their veins to satisfy the dead-end addiction they picked up in hospitals. In this society gripped by maliase, with its corrupt Grant Administration, the city-wide stranglehold of Boss Tweed, and looming bank collapses, a young newspaperman is confronted with a story too fantastic to be true. His friend has seen his evil tycoon father--a man months in the grave--riding through Manhattan's streets in broad daylight along with other old men, each supposedly long dead, all among the wealthiest individuals in America! The story unwraps from there to take us into the secret laboratory of a brilliant (though deliciously mad) scientist, a man of so far ahead of his time he accomplished feats of medical science unknown to us today in the 21st century. This novel of kidnapping, of faked demises, of medicine wedding science and of amoral genius squandered, is an atmospheric period thriller such as only E.L. Doctorow, New York's greatest living storyteller, could create.	2005-09-26

Doctorow wanted to write a novel about the life of the ruthless and slightly kooky 1930's gangster Dutch Schultz, and he chose to do it in an interesting manner. Rather than doing what most every other author might and delivering a straight re-telling of the events late in Schultz's bloody career, Doctorow used the device of creating a fifteen-year-old narrator, Billy Bathgate, to relate the tale and move it forward. Billy, a smart, tough, but somehow innocent working class kid, walks us through the last year in Schultz's life and tells us about the principal players in the story, Schultz's inner circle of thugs, the rival gangs, the accountant, Bo, who betrayed Schultz when he thought his boss was headed to prison (Schultz beat the tax evasion rap with a gutsy argument that involved protection from self-incrimination) and Billy describes the smoking hot redhead society girl, first the doomed accountant's girlfriend, then Schultz's girlfriend and later Billy's, who gets her rich-girl kicks hanging with mobsters, and who ultimately contributed far more to the gang's downfall than she ever cared to know.<br /><br />Billy leaves behind his none-too-sane mother and impoverished New York roots in a Jewish neighborhood and takes up as Schultz's mascot. He moves along with the gangsters as their expansionist ambitions abrade the more cautious goals of Lucky Luciano (a man so scary to Billy Bathgate that Billy never mentions him by name, even the half-century later in which the memoir of his youth is being told). He is there when Schultz plots to assassinate Thomas Dewey, future front runner in the race for the White House and then a prosecutor taking on the East Coast mob. Billy comes into the picture at the moment Schultz has reached the top of his career, and he rides the decline with him, right to the moment of the crime lord's collapse.<br /><br />Billy was a witness to the \\"hit\\" in a chop house that took out the inner circle of the Schultz gang, and somehow convinces us he sneaked into the hosptial room to listen to the dying Dutchman babble through his hours-long final words, in which the fatally-wounded gangster's stream of consciousness is recorded word for word in a version Billy cautions us differs slightly from the accepted transcript.<br /><br />In the closing chapter of the novel, Billy in his post-Dutch Schultz life, makes the stark transition from mobster's adopted little brother to ordinary teenager. He returns home to his mother, he goes to school, gets a job, eventually enlists in the military when the Second World War erupts. He lives as normal a life as possible. But Billy has a secret not even the piercing stare of Lucky Luciano was able to pry loose from him at his interrogation. Billy, you see, clever beyond words, has made off with the Schultz gang's fortune. He tells no one of this for years, knowing he is watched by the agents of Murder Incorporated. But when the time is right, decades in the future, a whole different age of American culture, when the Depression-era criminals like Dutch Schultz are the stuff of history books, he retrieves his justly-gotten gains and spends the crime lord's loot on a legitimate business enterprise of his own, and becomes a very rich man.<br /><br />Billy Bathgate is a novel that kicks some serious posterior.

Connell tells the story of the violent, tragic era as it surely was, with one side struggling viciously for its very life within its ancient homeland, and the other exerting manifest destiny while sowing the seeds of an industrial democracy in what was viewed as the open frontier of a continent already legally divided and waiting for white occupation. I applaud Connell's bravery in portrying Custer as something other than an insane bloodlusting bigot. Under Connell's educated treatment, the Custer who emerges in Son of the Morning Star is a man deeply in love with his wife, a man of self-confidence, cocky, ambitious, an adventure seeker who enjoyed a remarkable run of good fortune in battle, until the day that luck abandoned him altogether. Custer does not seem to have hated his Indian foes so much as merely relished the soldier's life and the glory doing battle against the \\"redskins\\" brought to him. Custer, a pop culture and media superstar of the 1870's, clearly had every intention of making a run for the White House, and had he survived a final, successful campaign in Montana, he might well have become President of the United States in the troubled election of 1876. Furthermore, in this book we are given Little Big Horn as it happened, nearly minute by minute. I don't know of any other writer who has composed an account of Little Big Horn that makes it seem so much like he was there to observe it unfold. Under Connell's prose, the dreary, horrific battle seems as recent as yesterday.terday.	2005-09-25

The first book I found was back in college and it was by hypnotherapy guru Dick Sutphen, who, as I recall, cited Sedona as the one-time location of a colony of refugees from the continent (not an island but a whole continent, mind you) of Atlantis. And then there was this more recent work by author Tom Dongo. (Betcha that name got him beaten up a few times on the playground, huh?)<br /><br />Here's my opinion: if people want to feel good about a pilgrimage to this New Age Mecca, then great, it's no more or less invalid than those of other faiths making a trip to a site germane to their convictions. But I feel that if there was something special going on around those red rocks, then it would seem to reason that the year-round residents of Sedona might manifest more abundantly than anyone else the powers the rocks bestow. Applying Tom Dongo's claims about the rock formations of Sedona being sites of earthly energy, then we should see the plants and trees of Sedona growing especially well, the children who spent their formative years there breaking all records in educational achievement, in their health and in their well-being. We should see fewer cases of depression, fewer stress-related ills, fewer colds, atypical longevity. If psychic powers are enhanced by being near the red rocks, then wouldn't we probably find more lottery winners coming from the environs of Sedona than anywhere else on earth? Just my two-cents worth on Sedona: a place of great physical beauty, where many a visitor and her money have parted company amid the Wicca-themed shops.	2005-09-25

Nope, not ONE nice thing. Across eighty-plus years and a couple dozen Bush figures, Kelley can't uncover a single deed by any of them that in her view merits her penning a single gracious compliment. No mention with any flattery (is there or did I miss something?) of former President Bush's service during World War Two, when the man might easily have stayed in college, no reference to how the current President's grandfather (eventually) opposed McCarthyism, no note conceded to the first President Bush's position among the top five Presidents of last century when it came to foreign policy, not EVEN a kind word for the charms of Millie, the White House Dog!<br /><br />But...I can't help but come back to one thing about this insomnia-curing exercise in gossip, and that is IF these things are true, then no matter how rude it might be to say all this, isn't it a valid exercise in journalism (stretching the word a bit) to print this?<br /><br />True tales or outright lies, I cannot like Kitty Kelley. She strikes me as one who glees in other people's troubles and mongers their problems and less flattering moments before all the world. She reminds me a lot of the sort Theodore Roosevelt was talking about a hundred years ago when he cited those types who do nothing on their own but are the first to sit back and criticise and mock those who do make an attempt at something.<br /><br />Bottom line is this. Most Bush foes will like this book, and most Bush fans will be outraged. Even I, who have little love for our current President, think this is trashy tabloid reporting at its most mercenary. Yet...I also suspect there's more truth here in Kelley's character-bashing than the sometimes ruthless Bush family would like to admit.	2005-09-24

Here, when among his own kind, we find the much-maligned Fallen One to be noble, honorable, brave, loyal, beautiful, eloquent, intellectual, defiant and determined--mostly exact opposites of all we humans have been told of him. Satan, in fact, is all-but perfect, and yet it is his own arrogance that undermines him and makes possible his terrible exile from the paradise that will ever after be denied him. Satan, defeated in his Heavenly rebellion in which one-third of all the Host of paradise sided with him, will throughout eternity be God's foe, and because of this, he hates man, God's greatest creation, with all his being, hence his efforts throughout history to oppress and ruin man's relationship with its creator.<br /><br />It took me three face-first dashes into this heavier than lead poem, but I'm glad I finished it. Satan is the best heroic villain in English literature, and God is crafty beyond expectations (although He is God, so how can that be possible?) to use Satan's vast pride against him in His plan for man's future. Some say the ebb and flow of Milton's lines here is akin to the notes of a perfectly-tuned pipe organ blasting out music, and I like that description. This is a great tale full of lines so utterly quotable (or at least paraphrased, as in: \\"better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven\\") that it amply rewards the exertion it takes to your force protesting mind through it.<br /><br />Even if you have to take some time off from this HEAVY poem, come back to it.

That admitted, well, basically I'll only offer this: I did not care for Ms. Angelou's poetry very much. However, were I to continue on with this review, I might also add that I failed to discern her talent or feel much of a personal tie to her cultural awareness or her message. I might even conclude (were I not stopping at what I wrote up above) by confessing that even the range of her vocabulary (or should I say the lack of a range)  failed to impress me.

The guards here are mostly good men and do their best to treat the condemned in a humane manner despite some challenges from certain barbaric inmates. The lives of the men on death row, the guards as well as the inmates, is mostly quiet until the day a gigantic black prisoner named John Coffey is brought in. Having been convicted of the slaying of twin little girls, Coffey is due to meet his end in a few short weeks' time. It soon becomes apparent to the guards, however, that the mildly retarded Coffey is both innocent and a sort of divinely-touched healer. The simple, gentle Coffey heals first the guard who in old age is telling the story, and then later saves the life of the warden's wife, who is stricken with a brain tumor. At times King lays it on a little thick in The Green Mile, but the sad story here is a tear jerker, no missing that. This book gathers all the individual novellas in the Green Mile that were released in the summer of 1996 and places them in a single-book format for easy reading.	2005-09-24

We had about three other mass market wedding books as well as a hired advisor/planner but those were quickly cast aside in favor of this one. Soon more faith was placed in this book than in tomorrow's sunrise. \\"What's Vera say about...\\" became the catch-phrase of the season.<br /><br />Vera Wang and her staff not only create beautiful wedding dresses, but they know the occasion of wedding from A to Z. Fair warning, this book does pre-suppose that some serious money is going to be invested in the service and reception, but for those who are planning a once in a lifetime event they want special in every way, I know of no other source I'd put more faith in than this. Everything is compartmentalized and arranged so that the important aspects merit more attention than those that can simply wait till later. I also liked the \\"take it easy, things will be all right\\" message that kept popping up almost subliminally in the little reassurances that were scattered about. Those were really appreciated by those of us who were dealing with a perpetually freaked out bride, and in a few cases, made a real difference.<br /><br />I'm in favor of something more minimalist when it comes to weddings, but for those who want an elaborate service and don't mind spending a lot of money to get it, then this is a book that prove worthwhile more times than you'll be able to count.	2005-09-24

Gonick also spent too much time in eastern Asia and not enough in Rome. His non-reverent views on Jesus, whom he treated like just another historical personage--and possibly a disreputable/looney one at that--presented the central figure of western history in a thought-provoking light that should take many off guard. (But Gonick raised a couple interesting questions: If Jesus was so important, why did the Romans let his followers go? And why did Jesus get so mad at the tree not producing fruit in spring, when the tree wasn't supposed to bear fruit till autumn?)<br /><br />In covering the period between the death of Alexander and the collapse of Roman central authority, Gonick chose a far more limited time from which to create his canvas, but even so the subjects came across as less explored than the 'billions and billions' of years the first Cartoon history worked through. But enough nitpicking. Gonick is a genius and this is better reading material than most history books out there.<br /><br />Well done, Larry!	2005-09-24

The monks of the Order of the Blessed Leibowitz keep written knowledge in the library of their monastery in the desert of what had, six and more centuries before, been the southwestern United States. The monks live in a world wrecked and ruined by the \\"flame deluge' as the semi-mythical nuclear war of a technologically glorious past age is called. What had been the United States of America is, like Europe after the loss of central Roman authority, divided into a number of petty kingdoms, who make war on one another on an almost non-stop basis. In this time of rebuilding and place where genetic mutants are as common as lepers were in the landscape of the Middle Ages, the one light of learning left on a planet of illiterate savages is the Roman Catholic Church, now headquartered near the river confluence that had once been the site of St. Louis, Missouri.<br /><br />In the first section of this novel, entitled Fiat Homo (Let There Be Man) a young man in training for the life of monk, discovers a ruin from the age of the flame deluge that holds within it relics of the great scientist Leibowitz, upon whose work the order was founded centuries ago. The young Catholic Brother is sent by his superiors on a journey to present his discovery to the court of the Holy Father, and the description of his pilgrimage across a broken, danger-ridden landscape makes up much of this first section.<br /><br />The second part of A Canticle For Leibowitz, Fiat Lux ( Let There Be Light) takes place several hundred years into the future of the first section and sees the world in a slightly better state. Nations have replaced the warlord-run petty kingdoms of the past and technology has advanced to a level where gunpowder is again employed. Against the wishes of the men of God, a terrible war between the nations of Texarkana and Denver is about to be fought, and the rulers of Texarkana are allying with barbarian forces who dwell on the great grasslands, herding cattle and maintaining a horse-worshiping nomadic life. To the abbey of the Order of Leibowitz is sent  a delegation from Texarkana, which contains a man of such intellect and learning that his like had not been seen since the time of Leonardo. This man is enthusiastically greeted by the monks of the Order, who have long awaited such an individual to whom they can show their precious library in the hopes he might make use of their knowledge and aid mankind in its quest for a return to technological greatness.<br /><br />The concluding section of this novel is set more than a thousand years into the future from where it began, and is called Fiat Voluntas Tua (Thy Will Be Done). The world of this age has advanced to surpass in technology, population and capability that of the twentieth century at the time of the flame deluge (as our world has surpassed that of Rome). The Order of Leibowitz is still extant, though in an irreligious age, al but forgotten. The learned leaders of the Order see that mankind will go on throughout its existence making the same mistakes over and over no matter how many chances God in his patience affords it. For that reason, with the threat of another nuclear war looming, the Order has devised a spaceship from which a select group of colonists may leave behind the earth in the hopes of founding a better world in some far away corner of the galaxy.  The ship is no sooner launched than the war comes and society again falls into darkness, and the thoughts of a dying monk, perhaps the very last member of the Order of Leibowitz, is on how tiredGod must be of the folly of man to waste all it is capable of with the many gifts it has been given.<br /><br />Walter Miller's novel is a fantastic vision of how things might truly be if (when) our society collapses, for whatever reason. I really found my mind stimulated by the concepts here, with history presented on a grand scale and the  psychology of humankind explored, judged, convicted of its inherent tragic failings. This ranks among my all-time favorite books.w tired God must be of the folly of man to waste all it is capable of with the many gifts it has been given. <br /> <br />Walter Miller's novel is a fantastic vision of how things might truly be if (when) our society collapses, for whatever reason.

Miller is surprisingly patriotic, deeply cynical, individualistic, and often mildly insulting. I found his trademark obscure cultural references charming at first but they do grow old after a while. (Not that Miller cares.) The thing that won me over here is that unlike so many other motormouths in the entertainment business, Dennis Miller truly has something thoughtful to say and the points he makes are generally worth thinking over.	2005-09-24

What is there not to love here? Setting this tale amid the legends of the lonely moors of rural Devonshire, Conan-Doyle revived his protagonist from a watery Swiss grave and let Watson take us back a decade to the day a nervous client comes to call on 221-B Baker Street. The man believes full well in the legend of a murderous hellhound which preys upon the male heirs of the all-but extinct Baskerville line, and he fears for the safety of the new heir, who is soon to arrive to take possession of his ancestral home. Whereas the tale of a predatory dog that arose after a 17th century curse might be laughed off in the enlightened Victorian Era, the stark truth is, the previous owner of Baskerville Hall was found dead on his grounds after a nocturnal stroll, his face a mask of terror, and about his body lay the paw prints of an enormous hound! Holmes is asked to determine whether this creature of myth, recently blamed for the suspicious death of the elderly Sir Henry Baskerville, is an apparition or a being of flesh and bone. Holmes sends Watson off to lead the quest for truth, and stays behind in London.  Over the distance of this story, a hyperactive anthropologist, a law and order fanatic local busybody, a slinking, creepy butler and his wife, a beautiful Brazilian lady and the lady's giddy brother are all introduced to us, as is the last living representative of the Baskerville line, an American who disregards all notions of any danger existing from something as silly as a demonic hound. The atmospheric story is super and sucks in even the most resistant mind as it simultaneously zips us back a hundred and ten years and confronts us with a case that is either supernatural or murder most dark.	2005-09-23

The \\"appetites\\" of American consumers in that ten years and in this novel itself, for food, for clothing, cars, toys, sex, even for lurid news stories to draw them away from the boredom the collective excesses of an age of plentitude cannot cure, are given the weight of Oates' keen judgment.<br /><br />The novel opens with the seemingly placid life of a middle-aged married couple, Glennis and Ian, who reside in  a wealthy New York suburb nestled in the foothills of the Hudson River. The couple is wealthy, prosperous, respected, and by all measures of the 1980's, successful: as a bonus, they are even happy. At the beginning it seems there is simply no plot to create out of a setting so ideal. But Oates has other ideas...<br /><br />The central story here is about the accidental death of Glennis, a famed cookbook writer, who falls or is shoved backward through the magnificent plate glass picture window of her dining room, in the midst of an explosive argument that began with a drunken Glennis falsely accusing her husband, Ian, of having an extra-marital affair. Though he is grief-stricken at the loss of his wife, the only woman with whom the vaguely staid Ian has ever been intimate, a death that seemed doubly shocking considering how important Glennis was to the first quarter of the novel during which she appeared with her well-written, three dimensional aspects poised to assume the role of central character, Ian finds himself accused of murder, arrested, and placed on trial, The case gathers steam and what had initially began as a clear example of a misunderstanding grows in intensity until it is covered by media on a national level. Ian, more or less innocent of wrongdoing in his wife's death, throughout the book never rising above the sorrow at his loss, hires the best of lawyers but soon realizes that with the multitude of lies wedged against the truth, his future looks grim, indeed. He tells the truth but the muddled facts seem to condemn him. Only his and Glennis' daughter stands on his side, truly convinced of her father's innocence. Ian comes to realize his entire fate rests in the hands of a young woman he barely knows and has not been able to locate, the stranger he had been trying to help and with whom Glennis was convinced he was having an affair. Ian struggles to find the woman, but she seems to have vanished: possibly, given the nature of the circumstances that compelled Ian to help her in the first place, she might be dead, herself.<br /><br />American Appetites is not the courtroom drama this review or any description of its plot might make it appear to be. Using food and elaborate cookbooks as a metaphor for the inexhaustible \\"hunger\\" of American consumers for stimulus of any pleasurable sort,  Oates shows us late-twentieth-century society in all its gluttonous excess, and weaves in a suspenseful battle for a man's life while she's at it.uture looks grim, indeed.

Setting aside the facts of history that stubbornly refuse to conform to the superiority of legend, Berger gives us 5th century Britain landscaped with towering castles, peopled with knights clad in full plate armor of a thousand years hence, and filled to brimming with villains, heroes, worthy quests, and enough glory, sadness and good cheer to burst the covers of five novels this size. Every one of the popular legends is here, along with a few new ones. Tristan and Isolde fill a chapter, as does Sir Gwain and the Green Knight. The tortured, heroic Lancelot and his faithless queen factor into the novel, as does the evil Mordred, the scheming Morgan Le Fey, and the wise, time-traveling Merlin.

Around age three this is the book I'd want read to me OVER and OVER. It got to the point where my parents or Grandma would bribe me into letting them read me something else, but, nope, I stuck to my guns and this was the one I wanted. Although by four I knew every rhyme here by heart, I loved hearing them read to me, those magically connecting syllables that were dubbed \\"rhymes\\". I also fell in love with the cover on this edition, that witch-looking old lady in the archaic clothes, and several times per session I'd ask whoever was reading to me to stop so I could look at the cover. Then I'd lean as close as I could and peer at the bright colors that surrounded the drab, leering figures. I can remember time and time again getting The Real Mother Goose down to lie flat on the floor and stare at the cover and then examine the pictures inside. It was great stuff!<br /><br />In retrospect, this book was my first literary love and I still have my copy today. I can't believe anyone would ever have anything but gushing praise for these funny-sounding old words welded into rhymes that speak of olden times. As for me, I still love them all and STILL find myself staring at the somehow macabre cover illustration! This book is just plain awesome.	2005-09-23

May we find him writing books for many years to come!<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about our second President and the often glorious times in which he lived. Though I stood in disagreement with much of what President Adams' advocated in the arena of politics, I think he was a sound, serious-minded, learned fellow of the variety our own vapid era neither values nor tends to produce in any appreciable quantity. One thought that kept recurring to me as I read John Adams was how remarkable it was that out of a population of a scant few million scattered across a thousand miles of wild Atlantic seaboard, so many political geniuses resided. (Adams, Jeferson, Franklin, Washington, Hamilton, etc. etc. etc.) That dazzles the mind and plays hazard with the odds.<br /><br />McCollough gets inside the mind of many of the figures of the Colonial, Revolutionary, Federalist and pre-Jacksonian eras in a way that is as much psycho-history as the \\"mere\\" reporting of fact. From this wonderfully extraordinary book I learned a good deal about Mr. Adams and my nation in its formative years. I think this is one of the best biographical works ever to be written and would not hesitate to urge anyone with an interest in the subject matter to obtain this book and be enlightened.	2005-09-23

The novel Roots tells the story of the ancestors of the late black power-era writer Alex Haley. Haley, who was an ardent genealogist as well as a journalist and biographer, managed the difficult feat of tracing his family tree back into and beyond the time of slavery in the southern United States, and even went on to discover the exact west African village from which his several-times-great-grandfather came to America in the mid-1700's. Roots, with its descriptions of kidnapping, brainwashing, cultural thievery, physical cruelty and cultural endurance among an oppressed peoples taken from the post-stone age jungles to pre-industrial America-what culture shock that must have been for an unprepared race--makes for an at times dismal, at other  times inspiring read. In the 1970's Roots served as a focal point of awakening, not only among those of African descent but for peoples of all ethnicities, to learn about their own familial heritage and discover their genetic roots.<br /><br />One criticism I do have about this novel, a point that has long dismayed me, is why Roots, clearly a work of fiction with only a tenuous connection to real events and individuals, is almost always to be found presented in non-fiction sections of book stores and libraries, when surely it must be acknowledged by all that this is at best a \\"non-fiction novel\\" and more accurately, no less a work of imagination than, say, any of the historical writings of Margaret George or Edward Rutherfurd. This blatant pandering to a false idea of what is and is not fiction I do not get.<br /><br />I enjoyed most of the experience of reading Roots, but I was not enchanted by it. I do think I can understand why many people found the reading of this novel a therapeutic experience, and I respect that, even while I did not have a similar result, myself.<br /><br />Addendum, 7-27-06. I have recently learned that the book Roots is even more a fictional construct than I'd thought it was when I wrote my original review. Haley fabricated nearly the whole of this work. It is largely a story crafted in one man's imagination. Reportedly a recent BBC documentary, so far unbroadcast in the United States, exposed this novel as the lie it is. There are those in the mainstream literary community who go so far as to seek to have Alex Haley's numerous awards posthumously revoked. While I always knew Roots was greatly \\"fleshed out\\" by its author, and expressed puzzlement at why it was not shelved among other fiction titles, I did give him credit for research into his family history, which it now seems reliably established, he did not undertake. While at least some of the more recent forebears Haley wrote about apparently did exist, many others, especially the branch of the family in 18th century Africa, appear to be total fictions. Sadly, Roots is a fraud and a deception of Howard Hughes-diary-like magnitude imposed on society.

It is at its best at the very beginning with its nostalgic trip back to simple small town life, and at its worst when it slips forward losing touch with its premise and delivering a stumbling narrative about how the lives of some of the central characters unfold. This book truly does start off charming, with its quaint Midwestern/Southern border town and the little boy who climbs the water tower and wins the bubble blowing contest, all the while his dad the local pharmacist, and mother, a famed, down-home radio show hostess, combine with his tomboy sister to complete the household at first central to the story. But then the writer loses track of the things that made this book begin so well. She splits up the family, sends the boy to Korea (and spends about five pages covering the whole war) and brings what had been uninteresting minor characters into the fore, then proceeds into a fast forward in time, abandoning the nice little town and losing connection with the past that made the story work. She then gets into politics with an ambitious rural figure's run for Governor office, slides us through far too many pages with a group of gospel singing mountain folk, and at last runs aground in the 1990's, as a married couple who had been barely focused on in the novel's heart, leave behind the little town forever and retire to a depressing \\"old folks community\\" in Florida.<br /><br />This book had its moments but it reminded me the author wanted to write certain meandering imaginative \\"what-if's\\" and not a real novel with a plot that ran down the middle of it. This ended up being a disappointment.	2005-09-23

I got this from a Hare Krishna at Logan Airport in 1999 and read it on a flight home. It ranged from silly and stupid with its far-fetched claims, to slightly creepy.

I think Seuss understood this because My Many Colored Days is all about bright colors and how they represent emotion. Colors here are used to describe the strength of feelings we all experience: curiosity, boredom, anger, joy, worry, excitement. There are yellow days and blue days, brown days and red days, black days and gray days, and days where all the colors seem to mix together in one big swirl. This is a simple book, few words, bright abstract pictures that are barely contained by the pages. It gets a great reaction from even very small babies, who like to stare at the colors, and older children who understand what Seuss was saying with his feeling/color comparison connect well with the message, too. Heck, older people, artists, book lovers, Seuss fans (ahem, college stoners) EVERYONE who sees My Many Colored Days seems to appreciate this last goodbye from a beloved and strange doctor, who didn't give shots and always made house calls.<br /><br />OH, PS, there is a DVD of this with music by the Minnesota Orchestra and read by Holly Hunter, that is visually stunning and a joy to see every time.	2005-09-23

Is Larry Flynt a champion of free speech, exposer of hypocrisy among clay-footed moralists in elected office, and likable purveyor of dirty magazines, or is the man the gravest threat to community decency since the abolition of the chastity belt? You decide.<br /><br />That Larry Flynt collaborated on an autobiography that wasn't a salacious commercial for sleaze shocked many who thought he man incapable of tact. When this volume showed up in public libraries, some thought pigs might have sprouted wings. But the fact is, this is mostly a straightforward life story whose subject happens to be in the skin trade. That I am about to write a review in which I say some nice things about Larry Flynt is little short of a betrayal of the ethics so many of our teachers in Catholic elementary school tried to instill in us in a city where Flynt's memory still loomed from his time as public enemy number one. Except for a few years away at college I have always lived around Cincinnati, Ohio, scene of the alarmingly bad idea that was the 1970's obscenity trial of pornographer Larry Flynt, then a resident of our uptight right-wing berg. As a youth in the decade after the trial, I heard names like \\"Larry Flynt\\" and \\"Hustler Magazine\\" occasionally spoken in hushed tones as if it were evil incarnate being mentioned (which naturally made me curious as to what this matter was all about). So when Flynt made his return to \\"Censornati\\" in the late '90's to re-open the first adult bookstore in town since he left in the aftermath of his ill-advised trial, it was major local news and I was bemusedly interested. I got the front page newspaper clippings sent to me and followed along as the moralists among Cincinnati residents and elected officials reacted with wild outrage to the return of this outcast Satan.<br /><br />So, just for background sake, that's what I knew about Larry Flynt when I began this book, fresh from having seen the fairly good movie made of his life \\"The People Versus Larry Flynt\\". (Even if it did make my home town seem like it had no one living in it except hysterical, repressed, neo-fascist Puritans.)<br /><br />I'll say this. Larry Flynt in this book is refreshingly unpretentious. He is who he is, an ambitious entrepreneur who earned every penny he ever spent and who is unafraid of taking a stand on the things he believes in. He is also a foul-mouthed, perverse, virulently anti-government, self-aggrandizing publicity hound, who made me laugh with and at him a time or two and left me thinking he is most likely basically harmless to public morals and in helping members of Congress stick to their wedding vows via his posted bounties on information about their infidelities, he might even do society some good.<br /><br />But news flash to young liberal anti-censorship types who might read this.

In 1793, an epidemic of yellow fever killed one in ten citizens of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, formerly capital of our nation. Anderson's plot is set during that terrible summer as the teenaged heroine, Mattie, faces the outbreak and its manifold horrors at times alone, and sometimes with those she knows. As thousands are dying--as many as five-hundred per day in a city of fifty-thousand--those who remain in the plague-stricken town must also contend with looters, with brutal roaming criminals who have escaped the un-guarded prisons, with the absence of food and supplies, with the constant threat of fire, that ubiquitous foe of urban spaces during summertime. Shunned by those outside the city, soon deprived of the company of those she knew in her daily life, young Mattie is compelled to fend for herself and face the horrid madness of this time alone.<br /><br />Anderson's novel recreates a time of almost unimaginable awfulness and simultaneously introduces an adolescent heroine whose bravery must surely have been like that of some real life Philadelphians who truly resided in that great city under siege by plague. Anderson also, I should mention, has crafted one of the best portraits of eighteenth-century US life I've ever read.	2005-09-22

I wanted to love this book because I'd heard so much about it. I somehow managed to avoid having it assigned to me in high school and college and finally this past summer got around to reading it. I don't know what the fuss is about. The novel doesn't present a bad story but it also doesn't tell a great one to justify its status as a modern classic. The opening line is truly brilliant but after that the plot goes off into a meandering pan-generational story about a family in a backward region of South America that didn't stimulate my interest very much. Maybe it illustrates how little truly goes on in this novel when I point out that my favorite part of this book came early on when a centuries-old Spanish helm was discovered in a creekbed. To say that a minor moment like that was the best one of an entire 120,000-word novel isn't that strong of an endorsement.<br /><br />I also have to say here, I hate it when \\"discussion questions\\" are printed in the back of a novel. Just something intellectually-exclusive and arrogant about the practice that peeves me.<br /><br />An okay book but not among the greats.	2005-09-22

Corky is a self-made millionaire (but just barely!) and a minor elected member of city government, friend to the monied and political elite, yet somehow socially beneath all of them, unknown to him but clear to us a sort of friendly, slobbery dog they allow into their presence because he's good for a laugh. Corky is also a flashy, handsome, charming man who has always had success with women, but he limits himself with his alcoholism, his course manners and by the curse of his life, which is his inability to move beyond the brutal Christmastime mob hit that left his popular businessman father shot to death on the family doorstep when Corky was a child, and the crime's sole witness.<br /><br />Over the course of the three days in the early 1990's in which we follow Corky second by second through all (and I mean ALL) aspects of his life, we watch while he becomes obsessed with the apparent suicide of a local girl who had shady ties to both a radical political group as well as certain establishment big-wigs, tries to contain his mentally unstable, violent, leftist stepdaughter in her own obsession with the girl's death, ends his relationship with his singularly faithful/unfaithful mistress, has perverse fantasies about virtually every attractive female within range, wheels and deals with his defensively Jewish accountant to hold his semi-crumbling fortune together, and we slide through the inner workings of his mind, sometimes his subconscious mind, via the non-stop inner dialogue of the private Corky being who he is.<br /><br />By the end of this hard-edged novel, we know Corky inside and out, as Oates intended. We know what motivates him, what he fears, what he would do in a given situation, and we can guess how the remainder of his life will probably play out.  We have met by novel's end, Corky the brave hero, Corky the self-dooming victim, Corky the shameless hustler, and Corky the vulnerable dead man's son, who craves the acceptance his flamboyant father never lived to get.<br /><br />Those who maintain the head of steam needed to reach the last page of this slow-moving but richly described work will have made it through literary boot camp and will be the better for it.

I love the layers here, the story that is simultaneously a fable, a fairy tale, a fantasy, a satire, AND, of course, a stark morality play that denounces the evils of Soviet Communism, which in Orwell's lifetime had sold out the Socialist dream he once embraced and on that foundation of betrayal enslaved an eighth of humankind.<br /><br />Orwell's great joke on the world is a classic for all time. In Animal Farm, the slightly paranoid man who died confident history would vindicate the fears that made him author 1984, gives us a short, rapidly-moving piece about a collection of farm animals who rise up under the inspiration of a Marx-like barnyard prophet, an aged pig named Comrade Napoleon, and overthrow the Czar-esque farmer who has tyrannically ruled over them for decades. The gleeful animals establish a utopian community in which \\"all animals are equal\\" and \\"four legs good, two legs bad.\\" They allocate resources according to need and divide labor according to ability, and then set about enjoying this casteless paradise. At first things work well, with all beings enjoying fairness and egalitarian ideals in action. The animal join to resist an invasion from humans who try to re-establish the reign of the farmer, and then return to their dream existence among the green pastures and well-tended barnyards.<br /><br />But then, as in real life in this thinly-veiled mirroring of the early USSR, things change. The pigs, kin to the great prophet Comrade Napoleon, begin to emerge as a ruling elite. Even while they still proclaim to live by the ideals of the glorious revolution, these animals centralize authority more and more. There is a power struggle between two pigs, with one, the Stalin -like Comrade Snowball, rising supreme with the aid of the vicious barnyard dogs, who work exclusively for him. \\"Comrade Snowball is always right\\" becomes one the new phrases under which the animals must live and \\"all animals are equal\\" is eventually altered to \\"all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.\\"<br /><br />Before the conclusion of this imaginative masterpiece, the pigs are driving cars, meeting with farmers who live outside the working beasts' paradise, and after their cruel betrayal of the working class (symbolized by a horse named Boxer) the pigs are last seen wearing clothes and WALKING ON TWO LEGS, the final symbol that these one-time idealists have utterly abandoned their revolutionary rhetoric and become tyrants far beyond the scope of the farmer who once ruled the land.altered to \\"all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.\\"  <br /> <br />Before the conclusion of this imaginative masterpiece, the pigs are driving cars, meeting with farmers who live outside the working beasts' paradise, and after their cruel betrayal of the working class (symbolized by a horse named Boxer) the pigs are last seen wearing clothes and WALKING ON TWO LEGS, the final symbol that these one-time idealists have utterly abandoned their revolutionary rhetoric and become tyrants far beyond the scope of the farmer who once ruled the land.	2005-09-22

The writing here is at once simple and deep and the settings--first our world during a time when a hurricane looms beyond a vast old family house, and later the foreign realm we visit along with Meg and Charles Wallace--is itself an awesome achievement.<br /><br />This book has a lot of fairy tale elements to it (journey to a different realm, strange and wondrous creatures, etc.) but the thing that makes it unique is how it tries to reconcile science, religion and magic by plotting the course taken by Meg and Charles in scientific terms. These lonely children make a journey into a more fantastic place than they had started but they do not just \\"vanish into the cupboard\\" as happens in many other similar books, they cross into pan-dimensional vortices and pass into other states of universal reality in a tale that never lifts one foot off the base of rational plausibility.<br /><br />A Wrinkle In Time is a book that represents pure magic to three generations of appreciative fans.	2005-09-22

In Will You Always Love Me, the flawless Joyce Carol Oates reversed a decade-long trend of writing explorations of the many facets of love among late-century couples, by returning to the delightfully complicated sorts of tales she reveled in during the early 1980's. These dyed-in-the-wool Gothic stories, set amid the familiar miscellanae of modern life, compel the reader to see existence within American society from a point of view slanted toward the harsh secret mindscapes that are concealed within each and every one of us, no matter how shallow we might outwardly appear. By establishing us as concealed voyeurs who look on into the lives of the characters in these tales, and by stripping us of our acceptance of the mundane majority of daily goings-on, we pass with Oates' aid into a state of hyper-realization and see things in these stories better than those who dwell within them: we see things as they ARE. No other writer achieves this quite as skillfully as Joyce Carol Oates. My favorite among these stories was the one in which the still-attractive middle-aged neighbor woman plotted a sexual liaison with a teenage boy she believes she has seduced. The rather frightened boy timidly admits to his mother what the woman has planned, and the mother, with the strategic brilliance of a maternal warrior set on protecting her offspring,  expertly arranges the other woman's abject humiliation and in the process no doubt crumbles the would-be temptress' self-image to its heavily made-up foundations. That is viciousness doled out with a minimalism that is an Oatesean trademark. This story and nearly two-dozen others await inside Will You Always Love Me, Joyce Carol Oates' finest collection in many years.	2005-09-21

These roughly 150 stories of supposed true-life hauntings from across the American Heartland are an entertaining and not too spooky collection that make a fun read for anyone with a bent toward accounts of ghostly goings-on. These reports challenge the niceties of the accepted axiom \\"there are no such things as ghosts!\\" From decaying haunted houses, to fraternity hangouts, to whole towns infected with preternatural unease, from playful spirits to hate-filled demons, the authors have scoured the folklore banks of the Midwest and retold Resurrection Mary, the spirit of the dunes, Lincoln's phantom funeral train, and an Illinois house so overrun with evil that no one has ever successfully spent the night in its attic. I didn't find anything in here overpoweringly chilling but I know some people who spent nights sleeping with the lights on because of things they read in this book. I think it comes down to your tolerance levels but in my opinion these bits of folklore, tall tale and urban legend combine with the genuinely unexplained and set a reader up for a mind-twisting ride that's sure to kick start even the most sluggish imagination.	2005-09-21

During its best moments this well-written but poorly executed book is brimming with suspense and at others it is a chore to keep going through longwinded material that burdens us with frustrating asides that bear no relevance to the main plotline.<br /><br />This tale of murder and cover-up in the early 1980's deals with a handful of students at a fictional New England college, who know one another via a unique Classical Studies program, run by an aloof, bizarre professor, whose entire curriculum is centered on all things classically Greek. The main character of the novel has gotten into the college by the skin of his teeth. He is poor and deprived of the sort of background needed to secure his admission into the Classics program he longs to be part of. When he finally is admitted via some professorial whim, he finds himself never quite accepted into the inner circle of the class, which is composed of a half dozen young people from wealthy backgrounds, who do not technically \\"need\\" their college degrees and can therefore afford the indulgence of being in a program with zero real world applicability.  The students--incestuous twins, a secretly homosexual genius, a dominant, billionaire alpha male--have a secret society, from which the main character is excluded. Egged on by the urging of their mentor, the professor, that they immerse themselves in the very mindset of ancient times, the core group in the classes set off one night (without the main character) to recreate a Dionysian revel, complete with drugs, alcohol and, as it is termed, \\"a sexual element\\".  In the course of this experience, which through its physical excesses appears to pierce some veil that separates our world from the divinity of the next, a local farmer is accidentally killed.  The students are deft in concealing this careless slaying, but find themselves left open to blackmail by a foppish wastrel at the college, the odious, parasitic Bunny, who intends to bleed them dry financially in return for his silence.  The group reacts defensively and seeks to silence their inept, venal, foe. They embroil the main character in their deeds, perhaps, he is aware, for use as a patsy to take the blame for them, and various plots are weighed and considered and finally a simple \\"accident\\" is arranged for Bunny, this human liability.<br /><br />Everything written in this review transpires in The Secret History before roughly page 200, so the second half of the book is all about the results and consequences of what the group has done-or not done. The Secret History is not good enough to be hailed as a great novel, nor is it quite bad enough to be judged \\"mediocre\\", so it languishes in a purgatory between its unleveled extremes as it varies from extraordinary to dull, from amazing to lackluster.

He was hailed by nineteenth-century Americans as the epitome of the \\"noble savage\\" and later became the namesake of many thousands of boys born in the early decades of that century (including Union General William Tecumseh Sherman). Whereas in death Tecumseh was hailed with pride as a worthy adversary, in life his name struck nightmarish fear into whites from Cincinnati to Buffalo, and caused nearly the whole of the US Army to be sent west in opposition to his highly successful war against what he saw as the American invasion of his native soil<br /><br /> This book does a spectacular job of filtering through the legend and finding the real biography of a figure whose life reads like a story of fiction. Tecumseh was a visionary (some say literally) who looked ahead and saw what the consequences of US expansion would be for the aboriginal populations of the North American continent. The preservation of his people and its culture being this wise leader's greatest priority, this amazing man laid aside his grief over the murders of two family members by expansionist whites, and at first sought to make treaties with the American government. Tecumseh kept his word and maintained peace on the frontier border, but after Washington broke its word again and again and used episodes of one-sided peace to slaughter whole Shawnee villages in Ohio, Tecumseh saw there was no alternative but to begin a war that he knew would have but one possible outcome: either the expansion of the United States into the west would be halted, or his and other native cultures would be destroyed within a generation.<br /><br />Tecumseh used his charisma and eloquence to persuade ardent enemies among Indian nations to lay aside their grievances and unify in an effort to stop the white man who was yearly seizing territory in the Ohio Valley homeland of so many tribes. Tecumseh crisscrossed North America, from Florida to Canada, whipping up fierce hatred of the whites and raising an army to strike at their mutual enemy. Under Tecumseh's fearless leadership, the Indian forces--warriors from a score of diverse peoples--won victory after victory over the American settlers, militia and armies. For a time US settlement into the Shawnee homeland was halted and Tecumseh's dream almost seemed within reach...and then this tactical genius made a horrible error in allying with the English in the War of 1812. Tecumseh, a man of deep personal honor, aided this European superpower in its goals of preventing the US takeover of Canada, but the English in their stead betrayed their Indian allies, whom they regarded as mere primitives, and ultimately set them up for a battle that would result in their doom.<br /><br />An American President once said that were it not for the presence of the United States, a man as gifted in all the arts of leadership as Tecumseh was would have established an empire that enclosed all of eastern America and surpassed that of the Aztecs in greatness. Certainly Tecumseh was a rare individual who came close to becoming for his people what George Washington was for his. This book untangles fact and fiction and gives us the story of one of the great men of the North American continent.

The doomed Lisbon sisters, pretty, almost interchangeable teen girls from a strict suburban Detroit home in the disaffected 1970's, live in an air-less environment, overseen by well-meaning parents, one a teacher at the girls' school, who are so disconnected from their daughters' needs that you can't help but side with those who place the blame for the sisters' bizarre endings on them. While this plot might reach in and stimulate the same parts of your brain that are turned on by tabloid stories and tragic news events, the whole overpowering feeling is one that makes an empathetic reader uneasy. This is, after all, a book about a supremely messed-up family, sisters who take their own lives in the prime of youth, and of the reactions to the sisters' lives and deaths (especially the latter) as told by the novella's narrator, a sort of \\"collective consciousness\\" for all the local boys, and indeed at times for the town itself, as the deaths are probed, analyzed, felt, and ultimately parodied.

This volume concentrates on the more obscure among Edward Gorey's output, and in fact several of the tales here I had never heard of before I acquired Amphigorey Too. The irony in the fact so many of these illustrated tales are humorous (in addition to being ironic, strange and disturbing) is that Gorey balanced their intentional comic value with the concept that he was not trying to provide his readers with unalterated amusement. In fact an editor once challenged Gorey by saying, \\"Edward, this isn't funny.\\" To which Gorey replied, \\"Sir, isn't it best that it not be?\\" Amphigorey Too is a wonderful compiliation and a must-have for any Gorey fan.	2005-09-20

This poet of freedom (even his poems disobey every respected rule of form) penned verses that celebrated the American spirit as no other writer had since Walt Whitman. If presented with a sampling of his most famous lines, the average American would probably light up and say, \\"Oh, yeah! Okay, I've heard that one.\\" Reading the collected works of this Midwesterner is full of such moments of re-discovery. All of Sandburg's published books are here, putting his many hundreds of poems on display. His finest work, the controversial, slow-moving, stream of consciousness piece \\"The People, Yes\\" alone makes this anthology a gift to modern readers, but many other unexpected gems await to delight, challenge, inform, or taunt with sheer irony. Though some of these poems date back nearly a century, at no time does Sandburg ever sound anything but cutting-edge and post-modern. He is one of the greats for all ages of man.	2005-09-20

It still isn't that bad of a book! What you get here from Mcinerney is a story about a friendship between a social rebel from the deep south and a scholarly conformist that endures for over three decades, from the confines of a ridiculously archaic prep school to the internet age, passing thru Civil Rights, Vietnam, the rise of blues-rock, and finally ending on the theme of what one friend will do for another in a conclusion that I sure as shooting never saw coming. The Last of the Savages opens with a sentence so profoundly lovely it could have belonged in one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's works, and some of the characters in here are more enduring in the memory than even those in Brightness Falls. The humor in this novel is wry and ironic and comes off as funnier than Mcinerney is known for. So even if it's not the best thing ever written, it has its moments of charm. This is Jay Mcinerney is unusual form and I thought it was interesting.	2005-09-20

I like versions of the legends with more traditional tales where the major figures are in something like their more typically assigned roles. But I do find room in my soul for a book that slants the familiar and beloved Arthurian stories into another direction. This is the rise and fall of a King, as told from the perspective of the women who were there: mother, sister, wife. It is a novel that relies heavily on mystical themes and sets its banner down smack into the Celtic side of the era. The priestesses of the magical island of Avalon figure heavily into this novel, and the message is one of multiple tragedies: the fall of Arthur, true, but outweighing that, the loss of the earth goddess sect who gives way to the intrusions of male-oriented Christianity. After peacefully overseeing Britain through millennia, the age of the goddess and her clerics is ending, and the transition is an uneasy one. This is not the mainstream story of Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table, nor is it a version that sets \\"Morgan Le Fey\\" down as the villain responsible for the ruination of a great king and his kingdom. Marion Zimmer Bradley is an inventive woman and her novel reflects that in every word. The tone here is arcane, and by stepping into the world of The Mists of Avalon, you are clearly leaving behind the familiar and escaping into a past that confronts those who seek to resist its allure. This is escapism at its best. It is a re-telling of almost sacred mythology, and it is a story at times familiar and at others wholly new. In Zimmer Bradley's hands, the mists are crossed and an attentive reader can discover a primeval Britain where enchantment was the order of the day.	2005-09-19

Don't try to find out more because you'd be cheating yourself of some fine moments of revelation.<br /><br />I'm not going to say much in description of the story, because it ought to be a crime to spoil this intricately unfolded tale and I don't want to be guilty of that. I think certain reviewers on Amazon who said too much in reference to key surprises in The Historian should have had the tact not to. I'll leave it up to you to decide how much you want to know about this suspenseful mystery/thriller/historical story before you delve into its intertwining layers, but fair warning, I'm not going to tell you what the book is about here, only proclaim how magnificent a job I think Elizabeth Kostova did. She's a new star on the literary scene and I can't wait for her next novel to be set to press.<br /><br />Quest novels are popular today, as evidenced by The Da Vinci Code's long run on the Times' best seller list, and novels like The Historian have come out at a prime moment. There are certain basic similarities between this book and TDVC, but this is a far more literate, complex and challenging read. I really became engrossed in the plot almost immediately and don't agree with those who say it ever became dry. If anything, I'd have loved it with an extra hundred pages of descriptions and Medieval Slavic cultural information alone. Dracula, as let's call him, remains one of literature's more sound villains and he does not disappoint here. He's a scene stealer and every bit the pragmatic barbarian a ruler in the Balkans of his era had to be. I also got pulled into the whole Cold War/Iron Curtain segments of this novel because that suffocating time can now be safely enjoyed through the lens of history for the evil it typified. (Worse than Vlad and minus his bloody reverse charm.)<br /><br />This was a book I truly enjoyed and I think anyone who invests the required psychic energy into it will feel the same way. I give it an unqualified recommendation and bet you tell your friends the same thing.<br /><br />Have fun!uired psychic energy into it will feel the same way.

The idea of a writer like Crichton taking a stab at time travel sounded promising. And it began well, too. By the end of chapter one I felt confident I was in for a thinking person's trek into the science-meets-sci-fi--meets-history universe that was going to deliver an intelligent sort of thriller.<br /><br />Nope. This book was a letdown of hard-hitting proportions. What started out as a scientific overview of how science might conquer time as easily as it has made headways into space, de-evolved into an adventure novel, and a poor one at that. Crichton threw in everything but the kitchen sink and he irretrievably lost me somewhere about the middle point of this sloppy book. Who was doing what, when where and why? I had no idea. I read on hoping I'd gain a fingerhold and make sense of the sword fights and rescue missions that had somewhere along the way replaced my study in cultural differences between two widely-separated centuries. Gone was the believable and interesting beginning with its secret labs and discussions of clothing, behavior and attitudes of the 14th century. I was disappointed.<br /><br />I did finish this novel but I felt robbed of the book I thought I was getting. It was Mr. Crichton's work, he was entitled to take it in whatever direction he saw fit, but as the reader, I have to say here, I think he made a mistake of mighty scope in changing plotline in mid-book.	2005-09-19

Clavell is often ranked among the greatest writers of the last quarter of the twentieth-century, and I am not at all sure he belongs there. I've read several of his books and while I loved Shogun, ALL his novels had:<br /><br />A) The same recurring themes and in a few cases literally the same storylines (and even the same sentences) recycled for re-use....<br /><br />B) The same frustrating lack of a definite ending...<br /><br />C) A habit of carrying the \\"Asia good/Europe bad\\" tone a little too far.<br /><br />Clavell here dishes up a looooong, slow as a melting glacier, story of westerners in 1860's Japan, all of whom are trying to better themselves with economic or political opportunities in this newly-opened Asian kingdom. The French, the Americans, and the British are all in competition for control of the island, as are a number of cut-throat international corporations. Gai-Jin (a rude Japanese term for a person of foreign birth, roughly equal to such western slurs as \\"WOP\\" \\"Spic\\" or \\"Mic\\") is simultaneously the story of internal strife in a Japan in transition from the age of the samurai to the era of industrialization: and ultimately global ambitions.<br /><br />Clavell introduces generally well-conceived characters but there isn't much of a story to move them through. As is so often the case with this man, there is a constant sense that \\"wow, something big is going to happen soon in this novel\\" and then upon reaching what passes for an ending, discovering that despite your long-held hopes, nothing ever does happen.<br /><br />When I completed this demanding, often far-fetched novel, I cannot say I had regrets for having read it, but I do remember a strong sense of letdown. For those interested in saving themselves roughly a hundred hours of reading time but getting the same story in return, watch Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai, which is set in the same time and place as Gai-Jin, and deals with roughly the same themes and issues.	2005-09-18

I admire the author's devotion to a subject that makes most of us, especially in the twenty-first century United States, cringe. I have nothing negative to say about his Buddhist slant here and think he describes the Book of the Dead and its passages well.<br /><br />\\"In the Occident, where death is much feared, the art of dying is little practiced.\\"<br /><br />How very true.<br /><br />All that said, despite Gaffney's seeming love of death (not just acceptance, but real embracing love) the state of biological conclusion seems horrific to me. Were I a believer in an afterlife, if I could just have faith, or better yet, proof, then I might subscribe to his \\"death is an opportunity to evolve\\" view, but all I can see in death is an ending filled with pain, the cause of grief, the separation of loved ones. I tried to wrap my mind around the views herein and I do find interest in contemplating another cosmology's take on the ending of a physical (chapter in) life, but to me, death remains a concept steeped in horror no matter how deeply I have tried to grasp for a way to hope that we might be reborn, either on this earth or in another plane, the bardo, Heaven...anyplace.<br /><br />This book ought to become the edition of choice for those who seek an accomodating starting point for one of religion's greatest texts. My lack of feeling for its tenets in no way means I do not regard this as a fine book that might help many people study Tibetan viewpoints or find peace in the inescapable fact that is death.<br /><br />Pace.	2005-09-18

It probably helped that I read this at a time when I was far from home and ready to grasp any reminder of my old surroundings, even if it was as part of a tale of those places long, long ago.<br /><br />For those of you who don't happen to live among southern Ohio's verdant river valleys, regions dotted with a multitude of pre-Columbian settlements, there is still a lot to recommend this long, intricate novel about the Adena peoples in decline and the Hopewell culture in its ascendancy. Many educational details of both societies are included here. (Including such tidbits as the \\"high-headed\\" Adena's regarding dwarves as semi-divine individuals of such gloriously surpassing beautiful that women paid richly for the honor of sleeping with them in hopes of birthing a dwarfen child.)<br /><br />This is the story of a group of Adena, Hopewell and a few outside individuals from other prehistoric North American nations, who join together on a daring quest to destroy a cursed object--a ceremonial mask--by pitching it into the roaring natural landmark we 2000 years later call Niagara Falls. There is a legend about this evil mask, you see, created as it was long ago by an evil shaman whose powers he transferred within it, that strikes terror in those who discover it back among them after an absence of so long the item had come to be regarded as a myth. (Lest this sounds too much like a fantasy rather than anthropological novel, know that whether the mask is truly so afflicted is never completely explored, the important fact is the people in this book believe it is.)<br /><br />In Peoples of the Lakes, the quest at the story's soul takes the reader through much of the Hopewell and Adena homelands, enriching that setting with several chapters on the everyday lives of those civilizations. The plot then sweeps into the Mississippian cultures and introduces a brutal tribe called the Khota, who worship (were)wolves, shed blood to please their savage gods, and guard the convergence of what we now call the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers. The Khota raid river traffic and war on anyone within their reach, much like Vikings did in Europe later in the first millennium. Because our questing party trespasses on their territory, the Khota swear to end their lives at any cost. Next the party, with Khota warriors behind them, cross Lake Michigan at the height of a severe thunderstorm, and survive to pass thru the lands of a peaceful nation of lake people whose moral values are both laudable and definitely--in a sexual sense--\\"different\\" from our own today.  All the while the group of main characters makes its way north, they face pursuit by violent enemies and must overcome natural and human obstacles along the way. When after a thousand pages this story reaches its climax, we finally learn a dark truth that has been kept secret from us: in order for the prophecy to be fulfilled, one of the people we've come to know so well all through the journey must not only destroy the malevolent spirits who dwell within the mask, but make the ultimate sacrifice as well...<br /><br />This massive novel about the values and beliefs of ancient Americans in the Great Lakes, Northeast and Mississippi Valley presents a multi-faceted story that will offer something to catch the interest of almost anyone.br />In Peoples of the Lakes, the quest at the story's soul takes the reader through much of the Hopewell and Adena homelands, enriching that setting with several chapters on the everyday lives of those civilizations.

It left me with many more questions than it ever attempted to answer. I also noted an instance or two when the historical settings Weiss' patients were describing did not sound historically accurate for what was actually going on in the time and place in question. (i.e. a suit of rough fur clothing in 1400's Holland?) In a few case histories, the lifetimes of a single subject overlapped. I know there are theories of parallel lives/parallel universes, but just pointing out that this did come up on occasion or two.<br /><br />Whether a patient hypnotically \\"regressed\\" is giving details of a valid previous incarnation or experiencing a fantasy, there is enough evidence that has been accumulated over the years to suggest regressive hypnotherapy is an effective means of healing for some people. Perhaps the spiritual aspects of \\"do we live numerous earthly lifetimes\\" should be set aside and more emphasis placed on employing regression as a method of psychological treatment. Professionals such as Weiss should be at the vanguard of a potential health-improvement tool that has been squandered for too long among New Age gurus who would keep it shrouded in pseudo-spirituality and make use of it primarily as a parlor trick.<br /><br />On the other hand, does understanding the root of a fear or other issue truly guarantee healing? No. I have a friend who is terrified of dogs because she was badly bitten by a German Shepherd when she was five. Does the fact she knows what caused her fear erase the phobia? No. And \\"knowledge equals healing\\" is the entire basis for past life therapy. So, maybe making more widescale use of regression therapy is not a panacea, but then again, many patients claim it worked in their lives, so perhaps it should be used more widely. My point is, it's past time hypnotherapy vacated the genre of mysticism and entered the realm of twenty-first century medicine. I think Dr. Weiss could have done more to facilitate that than he did in this book.r. Weiss could have done more to facilitate that than he did in this book.	2005-09-18

Upon its release Edgar Lee Masters' collection of free verse poems must have shaken the literary universe. In an era when the mores of polite Victorianism were still lingering in an America concerned with all things proper, Masters dared pen a book in which the dead of a small Midwestern town lie not in a state of reservation before Christian resurrection, but in a condition of stasis, ruminating on their lives and speaking with candor on all they may have done. The dead who speak from their graves in these wondrous poems reveal their secrets, their unfulfilled dreams, their disapprobation at humanity's conduct. The dead are to varying degrees wise, ironic, witty, bitter, content, confused, and moralistic. They have regrets, they mock the values of we who are living, they seethe with longing, they confess universal truths at long last, they await they know not what, the arrival of eternity or a continuation of their suspended state of evaluation, in conditions of calm, content, fright, or regretless joy. There is one thing none of those who have passed away from the streets of Spoon River to its hallowed acre on the hill, are and that is quiet.<br /><br />One of a dozen or so American poetical achievements that most fully justifies our nation's pride in its own literary accomplishments.	2005-09-17

William Manchester started out bigoted against the period about which he was writing and proceeded to say as many nasty things about it and its denizens as he possibly could, all in order to support arguments in favor of a later era he so clearly liked better. This book's themes are not new, same old unenlightened slam of the Middle Ages that was so popular in the past, and as written it's not even good history. This is a series of topical essays, written in no apparent order, that employ as much scathing criticism of a people living in a time and place as can be fit in. This is a return to the \\"Medieval humans were ignorant, filthy, oppressed, collectively dull specimens of the species, and thank goodness for the improvement that the 1500's brought\\" variety of historical thought that has been gradually dying a natural death as modern research proves otherwise. (These Medieval \\"oafs\\" built Gothic cathedrals, Bill.) I don't like Manchester. I mean I don't like him personally. And I didn't care much for the things he had to say in his simple little tabloid-ish book, either. He doesn't particularly impress me as a man of sufficient learning to have attempted a take on this topic. Even his title is gramatically incorrect. It should be \\"lighted\\".

Only the title story about a now middle-aged man's recounting of his older brother's affairs with three sisters in the 1950's, carries any real weight or lingers in the memory. Fans of Miller's novels, like the masterful suburban tragedy, Family Pictures, or the dark morality play, Lost In The Forest, might like to read this simply to round-out their experience with this author, but for those who appreciate how much can be done with the short story art form might be mildly disappointed, as was I.	2005-09-17

I along with virtually every woman I know has at one time or another had what amounts to an eating disorder and in a few cases, had them to a serious extent. With body image being as important as it is, particularly with teenage girls, I'm pessimistic that this book or anything else can do more than try to spur the one suffering from this insidious disease to WANT to do something about her affliction. I read this book because I was curious to see if things have gotten any better in the last decade as far as treatment of eating disorders goes, and also in the level of collective recognition among young women that a disorder is there in their own lives. From what I read here, I'd say the answer to both is no. On the positive side, this book did one of the better examples of addressing this life-threatening situation and if it can be gotten to the right hands, it could truthfully save some lives that might be in danger right at this very moment.	2005-09-17

If this was a work of fiction (and I'm not prepared to say it's not) then it'd actually rate a little higher because although it does go over the top into \\"oh, puuuleeeeeeze!\\" moments, it'd work nicely as a simple scary tale, but as what passes for an account of real events...ha, I smirked a lot reading this book, and I don't mean on purpose. It's a decent spooky tale about demonic intrusions on to this innocent old mortal plane of ours and basis for several movies. It's worth reading once as long as you don't let it get to you.

I don't think it is understood just how easily humans could have become extinct 700 years ago during the Black Death. It is perhaps through sheer chance more than any strength in the human immune system, that accounts for the fact that we did not.

Neil Boyd's charming autobiographical tale about his time as a curate at St. Jude's parish in London, circa 1950, is an underground classic. Basis for the HILARIOUS 1970's BBC series (that still runs daily in Ireland) Boyd describes the challenges on his patience and energy that went hand in hand with his assignment as new priest at a parish run under the watchful eye of cantankerous, highly capable and brilliant Father Duddleswell, the kind of priest they just don't make anymore. The very fact that Boyd is an Englishman working at a parish largely composed of immigrant Irish is enough in itself for some amusing cultural differences, but dwelling as understudy to the masterfully witty, compassionate and egocentric Father Duddleswell amplifies everything ten-fold. From mishaps at parish festivals, to confrontations with Africa witch doctors, presiding at wakes and dealing with (GASP!) the horrors of Protestant-to-Catholic mixed marriages, this peek into life as it apparently was in the last decade before Vatican II is a pretty hilarious and heartwarming book!<br /><br />(Thanks, Grandma, for getting this book, so many years ago, for me to read over there.)	2005-09-17

The man whose life forms the basis of this novel, Russell, is an aspiring writer who has shelved his ambitions and taken up work as a publisher, editing and pushing through other peoples' books. He is unhappy at his job, slightly bored in his marriage, and when the chance comes up to advance himself and become part-owner of a faltering publishing house, he seizes it....exactly days before the ruination the market collapse brings on. This is a novel of expertly appreciated manners and mores in Reagan's New York, augmented by a fabulously-sketched cast of characters, all moved along at a brisk pace by the power of Mcinerney writing in top form. Thus far this is the author's best novel and probably the greatest of all examinations of life among the upwardly-mobile in 1980's Manhattan.	2005-09-17

It's not that great of a book but it's not that bad. I can understand how it sent out shock waves once upon a time but in 2005 this created only the most minor ripples across my neither-prudish-nor-licentious sense of values. This autobiography doesn't stray far into eroticism but it does get graphic with unvarying frequency. It isn't obscene and not even that lurid, though the discussion is highly frank. I liked The Happy Hooker, literate and intelligent South African native Xavieria Hollander's memoir of her years as a prostitute and madam, but it ultimately ended up without much room for depth. She writes an interesting account of growing up in a strict South African home where her scholarly father made her speak a different language for each day of the week, and she tells an unapologetic version of her entrance into the world's oldest profession (she gets pre-tty candid, let me tell ya) but after that...things fizzle. Hollander stays on the game a little too long but eventually graduates to madam and momentarily the book finds its pace again with its Business 101 insights into exactly how an escort service was operated (bribes, low-key underworld connections and lots of \\"favors\\" to vice cops) but gradually it strays into nothing but a catalog of sex, sex and more sex, which contrary to what you might think, gets boring to read about after the first ten descriptions. (Ugh.) This dated, anachronistic tale of life at the height of the so-called Sexual Revolution, an era that bestowed on those of us born later a legacy of drug resistant STD's and an inferiority complex that we'll never live up to what our ancestors were getting up to, is a goofy, eye-popping but never embarrassing read.	2005-09-17

That's a tremendous oversight on Hollywood's part that deprives the public of coming to know a man whose lifetime accomplishments were every bit as fascinating and unbelievable as those of his contemporary, the famed British explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton.<br /><br />In Period of the Gruesome, author Jon Christopher Hughes has done a very glorious thing. He has gone back through microfilm and dusty stacks of newspapers  and gathered dozens of Hearne's articles that he wrote while working as a reporter at several Cincinnati newspapers in the 1870's. Hearne's writing is flawless, the style is literary and intelligent, but the subjects about which this 19th century Leonardo wrote are both wickedly lurid and wonderfully tabloidesque. I once let a friend of mine read the account of a police raid on an 1870's \\"abortion factory\\" in the West End of Cincinnati, and she ran screaming from the room. Yep, Hearne's newspaper pieces are still 130 years later THAT vivid.<br /><br />Hearne was an amazing man. He was born a westerner with a curiosity for all things scientific, literary and unusual, and after working his way from one North American coastline to another as a newsman, he crossed to Asia and become a mountain climber. Later in life, he was the first Westerner to visit Tibet and meet the Dalai Lama. Hearne eventually retired to Tokyo to write poetry and tend to his gardens and died in old age a Japanese citizen. He was one part daredevil (he made a bare-handed climb of the 200-foot steeple at Cincinnati's St. Peter in Chains Cathedral as part of a publicity stunt) and part old-time journeyman reporter, who went out and found his stories--generally the most chilling sorts of them, too. Hearne prowled Bucktown (later made infamous in the novel and movie Beloved) which is today right about where the US Bank Arena sits on the riverfront, and was then the murder capital of the USA, a hangout for thieves, morphine-shooters, drunken rivermen, hobos, gamblers and other assorted ne'er do wells.<br /><br />Hearne loved to shock and amaze, and he had a real gift for doing exactly those things in what he wrote. In one newspaper article included in Period of the Gruesome, Hearne attends along with lawmen while the body of a local businessman is unearthed after a fortnight's burial at Spring Grove Cemetery, in order for the Hamilton County coroner to examine the corpse for signs of blunt cranial trauma, indications that would point to the cause of death being murder, as the man's brother in law was suspected of committing against the late businessman. (The trauma was discovered, the brother in law charged, convicted and a year later, hanged.) Hearne also interviews \\"Resurrection men\\" grave robbers who stole bodies on behalf of medical colleges; murderers; opium dealers; a seller of therapeutic 'bovine blood cocktails' and writes some of the most spine tingling articles any media has ever featured.<br /><br />In these essays about murders, gross-out accidents, abortionists, slaughterhouses, Fourth Street opium dens, executions and corruption among elected officials, Hearne makes the Cincinnati of his era seem a match for Sherlock Holmes' London across the ocean. Who would look out at the sedate landscape of our modern city's seven hills and guess that a half-dozen generations ago such depravity went on here and filled the headlines of the daily papers?<br /><br />This book is disturbing, disgusting, exciting, amazing, and most of all completely true.hangout for thieves, morphine-shooters, drunken rivermen, hobos, gamblers and other assorted ne'er do wells.

Woodyard's fun and just-scary-enough series about true hauntings in the Buckeye state has kept Ohioans entertained for a decade now. These reports on supposedly haunted sites throughout the state combine anecdotal evidence along with results of investigations into the alleged presences. Over the years this series has taken us from Cincinnati's infamously ghost-infested Gothic masterpiece, Music Hall, to the defunct (but still howlingly paranormal) century-old state prison, Dayton's most spirit-filled graveyard (where a boy and his dog are often seen among the dozens of reported spirits) and even the tale of a ghostly wolf often seen in the mountain country of southeast Ohio.

These amusing tales of London's favorite claret-loving, Wordsworth-spouting, hen-pecked barrister are neither proper mysteries nor courtroom dramas, but really exist as amusing character-driven light fantasies. Horace Rumpole, who NEVER works on behalf of the prosecution, merrily stomps through the Old Bailey in defense of his eclectic clients, as he has for half a century. All the while Rumpole practices law, he is dodging the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in the form of the \\"Mad Bull\\" Mister Justice Bullingham, his arch enemy, and his own wife Hilda (better known in the Rumpole lexicon as She Who Must Be Obeyed). As Rumpole serves if not always the common good, then at least the individual good in his ardent defense of such clients as career petty thief Peanuts Molloy, he does it with a style best described as...inimitiable. Rumpole is a completely likable old coot, perpetually claret-soaked and clad as he is in the same courtroom wig which he's worn since before the Queen took the throne. Reading through this Omnibus edition of his earliest cases makes for a happy adventure through the twisting passageways of the British justice system as it SHOULD be.	2005-09-17

Thorwald, a proficient writer, is deft in his imaginative set-ups that serve to explain exactly how it was his main character happened to be nearby when ethyr was first used in an operation, when X-rays were initially exhibited at a medical conference, and then tells a tale that pulls you in. You come away from The Century of the Surgeon well-versed in medical history and filled with appreciation of the tremendous leap forward from bloodletting and patent medicines to modern notions of sterile operating fields, pain killers and hospital protocol that all came about in the short space of less than 100 years.	2005-09-17

In one book it is a quest, in another the tale is one of requested intervention of supernatural forces, still another is a cautionary fable concerning ecology. And in this case, it is a very fine murder mystery. This novel is set around the Chesapeake Bay region roughly a half-dozen generations before Columbus's voyage. It covers the culture of the Algonquians down to the smallest detail and does a fine job of contrasting their value system to that of other aboriginal groups (such as the more pastoral southeastern tribes) and also with showing us a people who dwelled in a region of such remarkable natural plenty that life could be sustained with very little effort.<br /><br />In this bounteous landscape a murder has been committed. A beautiful teenaged daughter of a powerful chieftain has been found beaten to death in the forest near her home. She had sneaked out in the night for a rendezvous of some sort and never made it back.  Amid the descriptions of Algonquin life, funerary and religious rites and crime and punishment, the story weaves outward, until a hermit-like old man, much feared and respected by the villagers, is welcomed into their midst to use his towering intellect to solve the murder of the young woman and prevent the catastrophic consequences her death might have on her people's immediate future.<br /><br />This is one of the two best books in the First Americans series and even devoid the bonus of its wealth of information on tribal life, it is a spectacular mystery that remains unsolved to the very end of this novel's pages.	2005-09-16

This book is like that. I kept trying to read it for the information it could give on tennis in the 1970's, when no player dominated Centre Court at Wimbledon quite like five-time gentleman's champion Bjorn Borg. What kept coming to mind, however, was the unpleasant future that awaited the Borg's. Here in Love Match, it's interesting to get Mariana's take on her then-superstar husband's preparations for his chosen sport, his disciplined lifestyle, his regard for rivals McEnroe and Conners, his off-court life in the heyday of disco. It's also nice in a nostalgic way to compare and contrast then and now in this most precise of sports. But as I said up at the top, it's also impossible to lay aside what came to pass in the years after this book was written. Within two years of its publication, Bjorn Borg would retire from the game at a young twenty-six. He would deal with personal issues such as depression and drug abuse, and would leave Mariana, a woman so certain that she had found her lifelong soul mate, that she states as much here in no uncertain terms. Mariana re-married, became estranged from Bjorn, and faded into obscurity. Borg would go on to be exiled from his native Sweden over income tax fraud, would attempt a comeback that went on to end in humiliating failure, and he, with his archaic two-fisted backhand, is now barely a footnote among players in the current generation.  More than the tennis history lesson, the lives of the Bjorn and Mariana come through as a brewing tragedy.	2005-09-16

The man who once reportedly confessed in a taped conversation with President Nixon to believing all Jews were damned, went on to become a cautious proponent of ecumenism beloved by men and women of all faiths, from the Queen of England to Pope John Paul II. Despite having lived a life that has taken Graham around the globe an estimated 1,100times (!!!) and seen him preach his faith in front of several score million, this man radiates a touching modesty that is very lacking in our present-day society, where the famous are too often the infamous. In this autobiographical account of the highlights of his amazing life, this \\"Baptist Pope\\" tells of his relationships with a half-dozen US Presidents and with witnessing a simultaneous rebirth of spiritualism in America, while beholding a decline in common morals that he finds almost disheartening. Near the conclusion of this memoir, the Reverend Graham discusses his hopes for the future of an America made better by a common obedience to a righteous God, and he testifies to an optimism that should be admired by all.	2005-09-16

She had wed her husband in a fit of romantic passion right at the outbreak of the war and then been separated from him for most of the next six years. She is now unhappy and does not exactly know what to do. Relations with her nominal husband are strained and she is full of regrets. In an effort to reconcile, the couple takes a last ditch vacation to the far north of Scotland, and there Claire, when walking alone one morning on the mist-covered moors, visits a standing stone legendary for its mysterious magic.<br /><br />All this is established right away in this novel, which then morphs into what is neither a science fiction tale, a romance story, straightforward history, nor a fantasy, yet which contains elements of all those genres. On that morning at the stone, Claire is cast backward in time to the same spot in the Highlands, in the 1740's, and there, alone and understandably bewildered, she must survive in a landscape both familiar and foreign. In this brutal past she weathers the first hour of her voyage backward only to be confronted by a band of marauding English soldiers who think her \\"scanty\\" modern dress is the mark of a harlot. These troops, whose task it is to pursue bandits and rudely keep the peace during a time of instability, intend to fall upon Claire with wicked intent. She is rescued as a result of a chance encounter with rebel fighters and taken in by Scottish clansmen who reside in a vast castle by a loch. Claire is treated with suspicion but respected for her medical skills (she had been a nurse in WWII) and soon finds an uneasy place in this society. Things in eighteenth-century Scotland are never calm and always dangerous and Claire's life is threatened over and over by events that unfold around her in these final years before a terrible war she knows will devastate Scotland and destroy Highland culture forever. Still, all is not hopeless for Claire. She meets and falls in love with a young Highlander named Jamie Fraser, and she makes a number of very real friends among these merry, solid--and in too many cases doomed--Celts.

Author Adrianne Blue rightly praises her subject for all the tough challenges she has had to overcome and lets us see for ourselves how remarkable this true champion is. I have always admired Navratilova as a player and used to try to imitate her style in the return of serve (but I lacked the sheer power to make it work). I once met her and she was every bit as gracious as a teenager could ever want someone she admired to be. With all that in mind, it's easy to see why I was drawn to this book and why I found the stories of the oncourt victories and offcourt challenges met and overcome to be so inspirational. Martina, when weighed strictly in light of her career on the courts should be an A-list athletic celebrity, but as this book tells, she has had to fight against a number of prejudices just to merit a modicum of popular acclaim. Even Martina's very prowess at times seem to work against her and crowds sometimes booed her victories over bubbly Chris Evert, then the most popular female athlete in the US. I found this book to be both a criticism of the unlevel playing field that still exists in America today and also a celebration of tennis' all-time greatest champion, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to find out more about Martina Navratilova, professional sports, or the undercurrents of exclusion that make it clear winning is not all there is to pop culture acceptance.	2005-09-16

Everything about this book is brilliant! Its setting on the \\"wuthering\\" (wind-swept) hilltops of a Yorkshire moor that seems not just ghost-ridden but somehow physically suspended in time is the most perfect marriage of location to tale I know of. The characters here, needless to say most especially the damned, tormented Heathcliff, rise so far above anything else written in the English language for the next hundred years that I only wish there was a higher rating than five stars to heave praise on this deserving masterpiece. I was given stacks of \\"classic\\" novels to read throughout high school and I grew cynical about them all, these boring, dust-choked standing ruins of books, but Wuthering Heights was a rare exception. This story of love, death, obsession and the indescribable energy of human emotion all but rises off the page with its ferocity. It's widely said Victorian women had fainting spells under the power of Bronte's prose, and I don't doubt that. It is not for me to try to detail this novel's plot, but rather to try to convey to you the force with which Bronte's great book struck me. I was shocked by its brilliance and reveled in all its suggested far down below its cacophonous words. Anyone who claims to appreciate literature and does not read Wuthering Heights is dwelling in a self-imposed exile from an experience few books can deliver. The sheltered Miss Bronte, in literature what the later Emily Dickinson was to poetry, was, in her era, without peer.	2005-09-16

Not a true mystery, more of a suspense novel about a race to save an innocent death row inmate's life. Also a love story between the woman working to prevent an execution, and the widower of the woman murdered by the death row inmate. I think the main suspense here comes from the \\"will he die or won't he\\" rush to stop the cogs of injustice and that surprised me since I thought from the cover this was more of a crime novel.

That fact aside, I love this book. It is plainly magical. The stories here about James Herriot and his life as a rural veterinarian in 1930's Yorkshire radiate joy. Herriot knows how to tell a heartwarming, funny tale, but he never lets us forget that a country animal doctor's life is hard, sometimes tinged with sadness, and that even in a lovely place like the farming midlands tragedy is never far away. He practices veterinary medicine in a small town and out on the little family farms that dot the dales. His boss Seigfried (later his partner) and Seigfried's jovial brother Tristan work beside James as they answer midnight calls to birth calves, stitch up injured sows, and partner with the local farmers to keep England's agricultural concerns feeding the nation. Around these duties, James has assorted adventures and is a time or two lead astray by the charming, well-meaning but definitely problem-prone Tristan, who with his skirt chasing and love of the odd pint is perpetually in danger of flunking out of vet school. These lovable men allow us to come along as they mingle with some of the most amazing characters ever seen in fiction. They work with farmers who live in such isolation they have in some cases never been five miles from their own homes, and Herriot's prose celebrates their glorious idiosyncrasies. The vets are also cared for by the stern no-nonsense Mrs. Hall, whose stoical outer features hide a heart of gold within her gray-haired workaholic frame. This novel, set over about two years at the very end of the 1930's always brightens my day. It makes me wish things were still like that somewhere in this world today. (And that I could go there.)d that I could go there.)	2005-09-16

Valiant from the book's title is a wise, brave shepherd dog who lives and works on a Wyoming ranch with his boy and the boy's dad, who are ranchers in the late 1800's, during the time of a deadly range war between sheep and cattle ranchers. This novel is a cross between lovely pulp fiction luridness and dignified children's literature of the sort not known today, and it brings kidnapping, the wild west in all its excitement, and the love between a boy and his faithful dog, into its plotline. This is a seventy-year-old novel and I wish it would be re-printed by someone because I know children and adults today would like it every bit as much as I did almost twenty years ago and its original audience did generations back.	2005-09-16

Taking up his modern story where the tenth-century Iraqi left his off, Creighton moves us northward across Viking-controlled Russia into a Scandinavian kingdom beset by attacks from man-like beast-monsters who rise with the night to raid homes, settlements, even fortresses, to slay any who oppose them and carry off children to a sinister demise. Fadlan become part of a band of thirteen warriors who answer the besieged kingdom's cries for help, and he and his comrades boldly investigate just who or what their foes are and how they may be stopped.<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT)<br /><br />The so-called monsters these Dark Age humans of Denmark face are actually nothing less than the last remnant of Neanderthals, who have survived in this northern land in the shadowy forests and caves, shunning the numerically superior humans, but keeping their ancient cultural practices alive. On this, their last ground, the Neanderthal clans raid the human settlers and respond with savage violence to their incursions onto their hunting lands. Fadlan and his Viking allies meet these Neanderthals head-on and even venture down into the depths of their underworld kingdom, on a mission to kill their holy queen and destabilize the foundations of their foes' society.<br /><br />In this extraordinary novel there is bravery, an in-depth investigation of Viking values, culture and life, as well as depictions of combat as it was in that long-ago time. This book is no mere adventure, it is a thinking person's journey into the past, which it explores with an exhaustive, sociological thoroughness. After reading this thrilling tale, one comes away knowing much more about the Norse, the Arab view on \\"barbarian\\" Europe, and we are given Beowulf with a new slant. All in all a pretty darn good return on a six-dollar paperback.-dollar paperback.	2005-09-16

The Koran. Certainly it is one of the two books that have impacted humankind more than any other. For that reason, it should be on the short list of books any serious person with an interest in religion, history, politics, sociology, or current events, should read in her or his lifetime. Supposedly there is no such thing as a \\"translation\\" of this holy book. If a version of it appears in other than its archaic Arabic, then it is said to be a \\"study guide\\" and not a translation. I kept that in mind all through my study of this monumental work.<br /><br />I think the Koran represented one of the most significant codifications of law since the time of Hammurabi, and viewed in that light alone its importance in human affairs is assured, but of course the Koran is far more than merely the basis for a legal system, it was the founding code for an entire civilization. To a devout Muslim, the Koran is a pathway to eternal life, a perfect record of the spoken word of God, and it is a reference work for personal conduct, societal ethics, and unifying morality.<br /><br />Is there anything for a westerner to fear from reading the Koran? No. Is there anything to be gained? Probably. I doubt a beginning to end reading of this book will change the lives of many people who have acquired it for the purpose of study, but in what it stands to teach us about the culture against which our own is at war (and I do stand by that characterization of our global situation) the Koran is invaluable.	2005-09-16

Burrell dispels many myths and outright lies about his friend and employer. He defends her honor against slanderers, and he creates for us the most flattering and human picture of the former Diana Spencer I've seen anyplace.<br /><br />Among Burrell's claims:<br /><br />Diana was not planning re-marriage at the time of her death in Paris in August 1997...<br /><br />Diana remained in love with Prince Charles and had not wanted the divorce...<br /><br />Diana foresaw her impending death and spoke of it on many occasions.<br /><br />Though Burrell will always be remembered as Diana's butler, and that position gave him the reason for writing this book, he was also for many years attached to Royal Service and he details fascinating facts about the goings on inside the Windsors' households, the private lives and true personalities of the Queen and other royals, and he discusses at length the logistics of managing a household the size of Buckingham Palace. Burrell seems like a good and nice man and it's refreshing to see that he did not cash in on Diana and make a buck spreading raw gossip about her.	2005-09-16

Although this is both a diary and a later refurbishment of earlier writings (to the point it almost becomes a memoir in epistolary form) Mrs. Chesnut, an aristocratic lady in a position to know a great deal about the workings of her short-lived nation, makes everything seem like a first-hand conversation. Chesnut, like Mrs. Grant and Amanda Wilson, a Civil War-era diarist from Cincinnati, Ohio, has a true gift at making the distant seem immediate. Her reports on the initial euphoria of southern independence from the north and later the reality of hardship and war, are touching, even for one not in deep sympathy with her ideals. What I took away from this diary was something of the horror of loss, as Mary Chesnut's society reeled from death after death, not just of men from combat, but children and women in part from the deprivations war mandated they endure. By the mid-point of her diary, it is a rare entry, indeed, in which Chesnut does not tell of the passing of at least one more friend, or son of a friend. She lived through the destruction of a society and a war in which blood flowed in rivers. Chesnut personally knew a number of the primary figures of the American Civil War, including the wife of Jefferson Davis. She gives a point of view that is not hamstrung by being modern in sensibility, and charts a course of the war's prosecution that might vicariously suggest a later alteration of the record in northern-authored history books. For all these reasons, Chesnut's diary is worth reading.	2005-09-16

The inside stories are here of the great rivalries that pushed McEnroe to heights of on-court genius. In concentrating on McEnroe the athlete instead of McEnroe the person, what this books does wrong is it fails to ask the tough questions about its subject's on-court antics, his off-court misbehaviors (the man can really be a jerk) and the reports of drug abuse and domestic violence that dogged him late in his career. This is a pro-McEnroe book and that's fine, nothing wrong with writing favorably about your subject, but it lacks objectivity and secretly reveals something resembling hero worship on the part of its author.	2005-09-16

Allen discusses at length the politics that put a conservative German Cardinal into religion's highest office, and also presents an educated guess at how the Pontificate of Benedict XVI might unfold.  I think the most telling foreshadowing of what this man might concentrate on in his reign is detailed on page 174 of the hardcover edition in a chapter entitled, \\"The Gravest Problem Of Our Time\\". This crisis, according to Pope Benedict, is \\"relativism\\" a view common in the modern west and which has brought about unwavering criticism from Ratzinger as a priest, Cardinal and now as Pope. Basically Benedict argues that truth and morals, having being crafted by God and defined by Jesus, are neither mutable nor subject to the varying interpretations of humankind in each and every age.  Benedict is deeply troubled by the popularity of the concept that each human must decide on personal morals, rather than trusting in the morality pre-defined by the Church, that steadfast custodian of Christ's teachings. Given the extent to which Ratzinger has made this much-debated question--humanism versus faith--a focus in his life, I believe we may safely expect him to make this a foremost issue in his time as head of the Church, and suspect he will soon author an encyclical that calls upon the faithful to search their consciences and find the answer to whether it is doctrine or individual conviction that should guide lifelong conduct.<br /><br />The years of Benedict's Papacy should be interesting times and I found Allen's look ahead every bit as significant in this book as his many discussions of what has already passed.ing times and I found Allen's look ahead every bit as significant in this book as his many discussions of what has already passed.	2005-09-15

Arrested and imprisoned for his political convicitons and status as a best-selling writer, Nansen endured the terrible condiitons inside the Nazi-run camp, and kept himself alive in part because his determination that one day he would tell the world about the camp and those who dwelled there with him: many of whom did not survive to tell their own story. The tone of this work had the effect of making me feel trapped and the haunting, eyewitness illustrations of hollow-cheeked, lifeless eyed inmates enduring this frozen hell heightened that immeasurably. I am glad Nansen survived his incarceration and lived to write about this horrible chapter in his life, but I wish others knew more about him and this descriptive book he dedicated to so many lost friends.	2005-09-15

I told her I liked it a lot. She said that's fine but keep in mind it has about as much validity in relation to Japanese history as the tales of King Arthur do to Britain of that era.<br /><br />Point taken.<br /><br />The basic premise is this: In the year 1600, an English ship's pilot named Blackthorne, while leading his privateering vessel across the Pacific in search of the Spanish treasure fleet, crash-lands on the shores of the great island kingdom of Japan. Blackthorne and his crew are catpured by the cruel Japanese samurai and held captive---sometimes under torture. Japan is at this time barely a generation removed from first contact with Europeans, and has a delicate alliance of sorts with the Spanish, with whom they trade to mutual (though self-serving) advantage. Blackthorne and his crew find themselves confronted by Spanish religious figures who seek to convince the Japanese of the danger the \\"heathen\\" English present to this island of the gods. However, Blackthrone interests one of the island's two principal warlords,  who interrogates Blackthorne and finds interest in him. Blackthorne is reprieved from a certain sentence of death and is given opportunity to learn Japanese customs and the Japanese language. He becomes embroiled in the seething politics of the island, then on the brink of a potentially terrible civil war between rival factions. Blackthorne at first desires only to return home to England, preferably with many riches in tow, but gradually he comes to feel the native way of life is superior to that of his own people. He falls in love with a beautiful noblewoman, serves the warlord who has elevated him in status to that of samurai, and then becomes part of the intricate, dangerous struggle for survival and dominance underway around him in a hostile, gloriously unique island empire.<br /><br />Shogun has a highly entertaining story with many released human emotions, enough action to keep it from ever getting boring, and in its details on Japanese culture and the religious/political clashes boiling over among the competing European nations who are visiting Japan for the first time, it is still, fantasy aside, the kind of novel to vanish inside for a couple of wonderful weeks.<br /><br />I really loved the people inside Shogun and found its story excellent in virtually every detail. The villainous Lord Yabu has to be one of historical fiction's mightiest examples of a figure one loves to hate. He went a long way toward stealing the story with his tireless ambition and unabashedly evil heart. The east-west love story that found its way into the center of this story meant less to me than details of the coming civil war, and I almost thought it at times got in the way of other parts of the plot I was more interested in and wanted to see move forward.<br /><br />I think it's fair to say that in Shogun, as in the other Clavell novel I read, \\"getting there is half the fun\\". By that I mean the events as described form the basis of what makes up Shogun, and ultimately there IS no final act here. All through the novel I kept waiting for war to come. I kept expecting that so much of what I was reading was preparation to the conflict for supremacy that was the soul of the novel. But not so. Shogun ends before the long-expected war unfolds, and that was slightly unanticipated.<br /><br />This is a complex, interwoven novel of races and civilizations meeting for the first time, of events macrocosmic and microcosmic, and of mutual culture shock in a foreign time and place where a number of remarkable people are cast head-first into events much larger than they are, and for which their pasts provide them with little preparation.rtaining story with many released human emotions, enough action to keep it from ever getting boring, and in its details on Japanese culture and the religious/political clashes boiling over among the competing European nations who are visiting Japan for the first time, it is still, fantasy aside, the kind of novel to vanish inside for a couple of wonderful weeks. <br /> <br />I really loved the people inside Shogun and found its story excellent in virtually every detail.

We learn going into this foreboding novel that at most one year remains to even the most fortunate of those yet alive. We read along as the last of humankind pathetically (or is it with dignity?) plant gardens, play with their children, reform from their alcoholism, fall in love, race cars...the list could go on and on. What must it be like to dwell under these horrible circumstances? What must it do, for instance, to the mind of a devout theist when she sees the deity to whom she has maintained lifelong faith is not going to arrive deus ex machina to save her and make everything right again? What must utter and complete moral hopelessness be like? How horrible must it be to be young and rise each morning knowing the despair that would come with so many hopes lying before you, now impossible to ever fulfill? And what must it be like to be a parent and understand that the children you bought into a terrible world reeling in extremis, will die in a matter of weeks?<br /><br />On The Beach is not about exploding cities and geo-political confrontations. The war and the nations who fought it are distant, quiet memories, barely of significance. On The Beach is about people, and how those people carry on in the face of a doom they neither created nor can elude. It is one of the darkest works of fiction ever produced, and also one of the finest. If it impacts a jaded modern reader so startlingly, what must it have been like to read this fifty years ago when the very concept of global extinction after nuclear conflict, was new?<br /><br />A universal, eternal classic of the Cold War era.	2005-09-15

There are the \\"native\\" Catholic Irish, second-class citizen in their own land; the Protestant \\"Orange\\" transplants who have occupied the north of the island for several centuries and have risen thru hard work and opportunism to social prominence; and there are the aristocratic English, whose 900-year dominance of this troubled, tragic island has never been more tenuous.<br /><br />The narration in Trinity shifts several times between first and third person as each segment of the story requires, and the characters here are generously crafted, without a single one-dimensional construct to be found. There really are no good or bad guys in Trinity--well, almost none--and I liked that. Perhaps it was his status as an American Jew that gave Uris the capacity to pen this solid novel with neutral detachment.  He gives nearly-equal billing to each faction of his \\"trinity\\" and makes a game effort to have the characters relay their points of view and tell why it is they see the bloody situation in Ireland the way they do. Uris never judges and he never condescends. He also--bless him--never once, and I mean not once, serves up a frothy Irish stereotype anyplace in his great big stout-hearted warrior of a novel.<br /><br />In this review, I'm deliberately saying little about the events of the plot, which I'll leave to the reader herself. I'll vouch here that Trinity is a solid, mega-eventful, frequently tragic, bitterly realistic step back in time to an island that is not the fairy tale kingdom it's too often made out to be in popular (especially Irish-American) lore. Here village life rubs shoulders with industrial slums, violent revolutionaries vie with dyed-in-the-wool colonialists, and enough realistic characters appear to fill a small city. There is love, there is murder, there are high hopes dashed to the mud and ambitions fulfilled beyond the loftiest dream. In Trinity, Leon Uris outdoes anyone else who has ever set out to novelize the illogical tragedy that is the north of Ireland.<br /><br />PS Why no film version of Trinity ever appeared puzzles me. It would translate well into about a ten-hour miniseries.igh hopes dashed to the mud and ambitions fulfilled beyond the loftiest dream.

Ray Bradbury HAS lived one heck of a life, and in this life, Bradbury has moved through the ages among some of the most interesting and famous people of our time. All the while, he has remained a forward-thinking optimist and a lover of both middle America and the one-time dream city of the 20th century, Los Angeles, where he's lived sans a car for some fifty years. The Bradbury his three-dozen essays introduce is variously Ray Bradbury the cantankerous old coot, Bradbury the surprisingly lusty young buck, Bradbury the opinionated idealist and Bradbury the name-dropper. What was missing from this collection was Bradbury, master of the written word. There just wasn't much to pin down my attention here. I wanted him to talk more about his books and I wanted him to share what made him tick. In short, I wanted to get to know Ray Bradbury better.  I thought I'd enjoy this trail back through Bradbury's nine decades, but in his true tales he failed to reach out with the kind of offerings that have made his fiction the stuff of modern legend. Here we can learn about certain events that inspired a few of his books, and we can be a party to his state of mind at various times. We can find out that Bradbury admires Walt Disney's appreciation of joy, and that Bradbury regards Disneyland as the epitome of that lovely inner-happiness expressed before all the world, but for every truly worthy anecdote, we must read thru half a dozen other lesser drags on the reader's time. This book doesn't take anything away from Bradbury's career achievements but it doesn't do a lot toward adding to them, either. I wanted Bradbury's views and stories from his life that...well...that interested me instead of merely being \\"okay\\". And OK is all Bradbury Speaks is.	2005-09-15

I am with him when it comes to subscribing to the notion that a CABAL exists within America to keep big drug companies and HMO's strong, while keeping consumers in the dark on natural remedies. I also think there is much merit in some of the cures Trudeau writes about. But what bothers me is that Trudeau \\"double dips\\" here. I shelled out thirty bucks for this book and yet as I read it I found myself constantly being referred by him to websites that would have required me to pay even bigger bucks to learn more about various health cures. I found that cheap of Kevin Trudeau and think it gives ammunition to those who say he is a flim-flam guru. Surely he realizes that? To use this book as a commercial is tacky.<br /><br />So it's like this, in my humble opinion. If you get this book, use your best judgment on what you're seeing. Be careful. Listen to your common sense. Yes, there are worthwhile suggestions here, I believe, and the author does a wonderful job of exposing the deplorable state of our money-driven medical industry, but there are also some odd things here and parts where a whole chapter might be nothing but an ad for a pay website...that I didn't like. So it's up to you. Some of this is excellent, some the jury is still out on, a little of it was annoyingly obvious salesmanship from an infomercial frontman.

The scare tactics by Book of Revelation reading modern-day prophets have certainly raked in some big bucks for those who have written the original and later versions of this work. Maybe they, themselves, are true believers in the impending destruction of the world as we know it, but a cynic might see the bottom line to all this as...well, as the bottom line.<br /><br />As bad as my pun about the bottom line was, this eye-rollingly off-target book about the coming ending of the earth is worse.

McCollough' story is set in the latter days of the Roman Republic and centers on the upstart Marius, a radical, brilliant, bold gambler of a military man who leads his nation through internal and external crises that threaten the stability and identity of the eternal city. It is also a novel about Sulla, who begins here a dissipating hedonist who aspires to dignified status, and by story's end caps a rising career of brave service by becoming the darling of Rome's conservative factions. This is also the story of two very different sisters, distant relations to the couple that will one day produce Julius Caesar, who wed the men at the foundation of this novel, and help guide their husbands to their unique destinies. In The First Man In Rome, there is a glossary that does much more than define terms that might be foreign to the modern mind, it also educates about everything from Roman clothing and foods, to the Roman way of keeping time, the Roman martial arts, legal system and economy, and the social structure of the era. This is a novel firmly grounded in fact and it shows. If it bogs you down with its slow tone, keep with it, it rewards you for your perseverance, especially in retrospect.	2005-09-14

The settings, Ohio's northern shores from about a hundred years ago up to semi-modern times, shed light on how different life once was, and how much most things stay eternally the same. One thing I thought was particularly nice was that there is a lot of happiness captured in these shots. Families from other eras were photographed enjoying their time away from work and school and that spirit of joy is easily seen and felt in these snapshots of summertime landmarks and people who made use of them.	2005-09-14

Religious Oppression Publicity Aside, This Book Was Not Good	The Iranians who were after Rushdie for writing this book could have  carried out their death sentence by making him read his own novel over and over until he perished from boredom. I'm no literary snob/reverse snob, and I'm not a novice when it comes to books. I have read and do read a multitude of different sorts of fiction, but I did not recognize anything to celebrate in this novel. It certainly DOES NOT deserve its place in the pantheon of free speech statements. A backlash against the Iranian condemnation of its content in the 1980's wrongly fooled millions into thinking this is a book of depth, \\"importance\\" or at least a work of fiction with something special to offer. None of that is the case. I'll say it here that The Satanic Verses is a muddled mess of dead end plotlines and boring events. It also arrogantly presupposes that a reader will be sufficiently versed in Islam to follow along in its satirical statements on that religion. If someone wants to champion a book that is both good and great and actually deserves to be praised for its contribution to the triumph of free expression, simply read Mark Twain's much-maligned magnum opus, Huck Finn, a novel frequently verbally attacked and removed from libraries in our own country.	2005-09-14

He has the unique feature of being as tall sitting as he is standing, and that makes me wonder if the convex dimensions of an author's backside are somehow related to the quantity of his imagination. You see, Manus writes far-out books. No, no, I mean...realllly far-out books. I think he  passes the Twilight Zone somewhere in route to where he goes to pen his creative little novels. Lizard Music may take the cake among everything straaaaange he's written, however. This story puts your brain in a food processor and hits frappe. What's it about? Oh, you want to know that, don't you? Okay.<br /><br />Lizard Music is about a ten-ish young man named Victor, who is left one summer in the early 1970's in the custody of his free-loving teenaged sister, Leslie, when their parents take a summer vacation. Not ten seconds after the parents exeunt stage left Leslie does the same thing, meeting up with some hippie buds and taking off in a van with the warning that Victor better NOT tell on her for this. Hey, Victor's more than happy to oblige. What ten-year-old wouldn't love being left alone with a full frige, a small stack of spending money, and no rules or supervision whatsoever? Victor has the time of his young life. He eats what he wants, he does what he wants, and he stays up as late as he wants watching previously forbidden monster movies.  It's this last liberty, the late bedtime, that sends young Victor's life into some veddy odd places. One night, past midnight, Victor is up watching the TV station sign off after the late-late-late show has concluded and right in front of his drowsy eyes he sees the most peculiar program he's ever witnessed: a jazz group composed entirely of man-sized lizards performs a concert in the minutes before the station ceases its signal. That's not to say it's a cartoon or guys in costumes...these appear to be great big lizards playing jazz. The next morning Victor wonders if it was all a dream. (He had after all been hitting the candy and cola a little hard the last couple nights...) To get to the truth, Victor stays up another night to see if it happens again. It does...and something else does too. Let me just say Victor takes a trip that's even weirder than the one his sister is on with her fellow hippies. \\"LiKe FaaR OuT, dUdE!!!\\" Lizard Music is the sort of book no one but Pinkwater could have written, no one could possibly figure out before its conclusion, and that no one will quite know what to make of when they've finished reading its mind-altering text.all been hitting the candy and cola a little hard the last couple nights...)

My problem with Vidal comes when he flirts with his \\"true historical revelation\\" gimmick in books like Lincoln, like 1876, and like this one, Burr. Vidal has a master's gift of recreating a previous era down to the most amazing detail, and he's undeniably savvy in his prose, gloriously apt in his characterizations and tells a darn good story in the meantime, but I have caught him out a time or two through the years when it comes to inserting his speculative opinion as fact, and also with tampering with fact itself to create a story that better suits his aims in telling it. I don't totally fault him for so doing since every fiction writer who has ever drawn breath has tinkered with reality but when Vidal basks in the limelight his \\"this is how it REALLY was\\" tales create for him in the academic and literary worlds, he should let it be know that he is not penning complete non-fiction. I have reached the point with Vidal where I lean toward suspicion when he releases a book. I know I can count on him to tell a decent story and bring a past setting admirably to life, but I do keep in mind things may not have always been the way he says they were. I also remember that more than anything else, Vidal despises the American establishment, past and present, and never misses a chance to say something unflattering about it.<br /><br />In Burr, the political strategist best remembered as the killer of the man on the ten-dollar bill is given Vidal's star treatment. We meet Burr the ambitious radical, Burr the would-be political conqueror, and Burr the charming free thinker whose love of nature, knowledge and self make him seem at once delightfully wicked and amiably down to earth. Aaron Burr was very nearly the third President of the United States, a fact often forgotten. His tie with Thomas Jefferson in the election of 1800 threatened to divide the nation and was not completely settled by Burr's elevation/demotion to the Vice-Presidency. Burr's story after this disputed election slides rapidly into chaos as he embroils himself in land-grab schemes, political feuds and eventually an infamous duel which results in him becoming the most hated man in the United States.<br /><br />In this novel, Gore Vidal plays havoc with what the public knows or thinks it knows about some of the most famous early Americans. Thomas Jefferson, as cast in this novel, is an out and out deceitful bad guy who lies without hesitation and advances his own agenda at the cost of anyone and anything. Andrew Jackson, one of the few political giants of the period who did not completely turn his back on Burr, is a bumbling country bumpkin. And most of all, Alexander Hamilton, maybe in sheer force of intellect alone the most ingenious of all early Americans, is a cold political opportunist whose unforgivable offense to Burr's honor in Vidal's version of the events, is to slander Burr's deceased daughter with whisperings of incestuous conduct with her father.<br /><br />Burr is a good novel and I would recommend it if asked. I would also point out some of the things I wrote in this review and caution anyone to give anything that seems fishy in Vidal's version a wide berth.

WRONG! This terrible excuse in slandering a murder victim who cannot speak for himself is disgusting beyond words. This is the lowest, meanest tabloid-esque exercise in character assassination I've personally ever seen set to print. How did this ever get published? What person would knowingly buy this?

What I liked was first off the fact it was set in my hometown and I knew many of these places the author pen-named R. T. Stone, was using in his novel. Secondly, a few of its characters were charming and I did sincerely get into some of the situations, like when the teens built their underground clubhouse and hung out there. That made me smile. Kids being kids? Things like that charmed me and made me forget how ridiculously hideous so much of Stone's attempt at a New Age masterpiece was.<br /><br />This circa thousand page book was many bad things. It was an all-out attack on established religion, especially the Roman Catholicism dominant in the Cincinnati area in which it was set. It was a far-fetched fantasy that didn't make much sense, and it was a poorly-written effort of the writer to advocate his own ill-conceived spiritual mores. In Stone's mind, almost any movement or philosophy is wonderful as long as it's one that no more than a handful of average people--just a snooty elitist like him--have ever heard of. Any and every outsider faith from India or the far east is greeted with gushing praise here in this novel, but Christianity is always treated as a fraud and anyone connected with it is either an oppressor or an unwilling, miserable victim of its tyranny. There are no happy nuns in the convent where one of the two main characters is raised. No one in the Catholic hierarchy who appears mid-way through to investigate miraculous happenings in the life of the girl \\"prophetess\\" character is a nice person, either, for that matter, yet those who are members of any sect vaguely non-western or Wicca are the good guys, wise, benevolent, sane.<br /><br />Probably the most blatant exercise in stupidity involves the messiah figure from another planet using mind control on a gang of (in Stone's hands needless to say stereotypically ignorant, loutish and bigoted) rural men who come and castrate him so this messiah can be sure he will only have one divine offspring out there: the one with whom he has impregnated a married woman after zonking her with his corny ESP so he can proceed to more or less rape. I stopped reading for a moment at the completion of the castration part and thought: A) if this being is so superhuman, couldn't he use will power to make himself not want to have sex; B) couldn't he use birth control if he has sex; or C) if he can work apparent miracles, couldn't he ESP his body into not making sperm; or D) couldn't he pay for medical sterilization instead of letting pocketknife-wielding rednecks do the honors?<br /><br />That about set the tone of \\"Stone's\\" whole novel: it might work a wee bit if you don't think but if your brain kicks in, you're going to start going, \\"HUH???\\" If you excuse the \\"beautiful new religion\\" that's coming to save the world for its amorality and immorality, look past its forays into homosexuality, bigotry, and mind-rapes, forget the fact its central savior figures were conceived in adultery, and finally embrace the idea it has nothing spectacular to offer except control of the earth by mysterious aliens who seem intent on supplanting all notions of God by introducing a lost book of the Bible that says everyone's been doing everything wrong for 2,000 years, then, hey, this new faith sounds just ducky, doesn't it?<br /><br />What you're left with after a thousand badly-written pages of preachy, heavy reading is a somewhat arrogant, bigoted, silly New Age manifesto of an egotistical would-be savior of humankind, that has moments of charm and is principally likable to me because of where its set. (When I read it I was also homesick, by the way.) Not a lot to base any sort of recommendation on,is it? And horror of horrors, folks, we are assured that the second book in this planned series of who knows how many volumes is coming. Scary thought!tion on, is it?

After DW gets sent to her room for hurting Baby Kate and generally acting up, she at first broods over what she feels like is her unfair lot in life, and then Brown gets really cool and makes you think about the way a child DW's age experiences time in relation to how an adult does. To DW as to all children, ten minutes banishment is a gulf of quasi-intolerable length and if a grown-up stops to think about that, it's a fairly deep topic, this perception of time.	2005-09-12

All the big names of fifteen years ago are here: Sampras, Navratalova, Selles, Graf, Courier, Agassi, Fernandez, Vicario, McEnroe, Edberg and Lendl. Great champions all. This is set over the course of one full year on the circuit, from the Australian Open in January, to the end of season tournaments that follow the conclusion of the Grand Slam series at the US Open.  Anyone who wants to learn about what it takes to compete at this level of tennis can get an education here. Also someone interested in the inner workings of the tour and the agencies that govern it can find out what they want to know. And although it seems odd to say this about one of the most influential books I read when I was so into this sport, it also serves today as the record of a long-ago year in the game of tennis.	2005-09-12

From the moon walk and great depression to Archduke Ferdinand emerging alive and well from his vacation right after the end of WWI (a thinking person's macabre joke there) the writers who created these would-be newspapers have authored some brilliantly-conceived satire that's delightful to read.

Tita, an extraordinary cook (that's important to know) eventually rebels against these strictures and finds romance with the honorable but staid Dr. Brown, and later with a dashing young man who wins her heart. This sad, amusing first novel was a smash hit in its native Mexico and was the basis for the bittersweet 1990's film of the same name. It's inventive and colorful, in a few cases not for the squeamish, and in the way it takes food and places it so creatively in the center of each chapter and the storyline that follows, it's very definitely a novel of profound originality.

I guess what I'm saying is the jury is still out on this since I've only had it six days and it's too severe and intimidating for just anyone to get major use from it.

This never-mean, never cruel, mostly hilarious tribute-via-parody to the world's most beloved trilogy will have you chortling within five pages and guffawing till your sword arm aches before chapter one is done. In this tale of the adventures of (hey, I'm just quoting here) Dildo Buggers and his nephew Frito, both Boggies (small hairy-footed creatures who some might notice sound a bit like Hobbits) a powerful though mentally-rattled wizard named Goodgulf, and a band of questing oddfellows including Legolamb, an elf, several other Boggies, a dwarf whose father was named Groin, and a ranger, an all-powerful ring of evil is transported to its place of origins, to be destroyed forever in the fires of a volcano whence it was created at the hands of an evil dark lord called Sorehead... This plot doesn't sound at all familiar, does it now? Effective parody is an art and in this little book it's handled with near-perfection, neither too silly nor too far-ranging from the subject that inspired it. I liked laughing along with this classic by the Harvard Lampoon, and my guess is any LOTR fan will as well.	2005-09-12

Set in the 12th century in southern England (with minor asides in Normandy and post-Moorish Spain) this novel sweeps history along in its tale of the construction of a great Gothic cathedral during three unsettled decades of internecine civil war and social disruption.<br /><br />In this novel a fine cast waits to be met. We start off coming to know Tom Builder, a master stonemason and accomplished pragmatist, to whom we are first introduced as he is overseeing the creation of a new manor house for young Lord William Hamleigh and his bride-to-be, Aliena, daughter of the Earl of nearby Shiring. William soon proves to be the villain of the novel and Aliena its heroine and through much of the next thousand pages the lives of these two temperamentally-opposite human being intersect to tumultuous, tragic, triumphant consequences. This is also a novel about Ellen, the reclusive forest \\"witch\\" and her son, the red-headed boy Jack, quick of mind and idealistic at heart, whose father was hanged before his birth after he was betrayed and framed for theft of a religious artifact by a politically-motivated coalition of the evil Hamleigh family and a corrupt cleric. Above all others this is a novel about one of literature's truly good men, Prior Phillip, a Welsh-born monk who rises from peasant beginnings to become a Bishop and ardent defender of all that is good in mankind and the Christian religion. Living as he does in a period of warfare and corruption, Phillip will have many opportunities to exercise the humanitarian side of his vocation, and also see his faith put to the test over and over in the bloody tide of man's inhumanity to man.<br /><br />The Pillars of the Earth can be summed up in many ways. It is a story about the 1100's themselves with the great and catastrophic civil war between King Stephen and the French-born Plantagenet challengers, as their contest for the throne ushers in near anarchy and tyranny under networks of regional warlords. It is a story of the age of faith that made the great cathedrals that were the heart of this era's achievement buildings of such importance and focus. And it is the story of all the characters I mentioned plus many more as they vie to dominate, create, or simply survive one of the most dangerous and oppressive times in the gamut of English history.<br /><br />In my opinion a very, VERY great book!French-born Plantagenet challengers, as their contest for the throne ushers in near anarchy and tyranny under networks of regional warlords.

She was sooooo amoral, so raunchy, so do-anything that she makes even the great Scarlett O' Hara seem tame and slow moving. Moll's story covers most of the 17th century and takes us in among all levels of society, from the poorest of the poor, to the richest of the rich. Here for the meeting are highwaymen, convicts and clergy, landed gentry, disenfranchised priests, and Virginia colonists. And if you read between the lines you'll also find Moll's story has more sex plastered through it than a season worth of Desperate Housewives with half of HBO's lineup thrown in to boot. And you know what's really wickedly hilarious here? They let this astonishingly great classic be read in high school literature classes everywhere! I love it! More fornication, theft, sacrilege here than a month of junk-TV and yet it's assigned classroom material. Oh, man. The rises and falls in the remarkable life story of English literature's most durable and clever heroine make for a plot that's never boring and typically has a reader balanced on the edge of her seat to see where Moll, the ultimate survivor, is going to end up next.	2005-09-12

First of all it impresses merely by the daring scope of its story--thousands of characters set in an historically accurate retelling of English history from the Ice Age to the 1980's--but it also impresses by being as altogether good as it is! Set primarily in and around the Salisbury Plain from the period immediately at the point in the post-Ice Age when rising waters cut the island of Britain off from continental Europe, Sarum procceeds thru pre-history to the building of Stonehenge, the arrival of the Romans, the Dark Age Saxon period, the twelfth century, the construction of the awesome monument to Medieval genius that is Salisbury Cathedral, and then follows on into more recent times such as the Black Death, the age of the Tudors, the Civil War, the glorious eighteenth-century, Napoleonic times, the industrial and Victorian ages, and finally it ends its long, unforgettable journey after making last stops in the times of the world wars and finally concludes some 10,000 years after it began, reuniting 1940's-era lovers in happy circumstances in the town of Sarum in 1985.<br /><br />This massive novel is the read of a lifetime and it manages to weave a delightful multi-generational story that never slows or becomes boring, never loses historical rectitude, and absolutely positively never, EVER, makes a reader sorry for starting the bold task of reading this gigantic achievement in novel writing.<br /><br />Mr. Rutherfurd is a gifted writer who achieved little short of the biography of his native land. I recommend Sarum to anyone up to the challenge of devoting at least a fortnight to a journey thru the lives and times that have come to pass on our world's most amazing island nation.	2005-09-12

Coming of age amid the political maelstrom of the late 1960's, the idealistic Jenkins had felt his faith in America's future slip away, he had a crisis of personal direction, and he was a man who had somewhere in his twenty-odd years fallen away from the hopeful dreams that had once shaped him as who he was. One day while talking with a friend about all the things wrong with the world, the nation, himself, Jenkins was half-seriously told that he should try to seek out the real America and see how much good there was in it. For a man who had become convinced his nation was mired in hopelessness, this challenge to find what was right in the US inspired him to begin a walk--yes a walk on foot-- that began along the Atlantic coast and would eventually end (in his second book) 4,000 miles away in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Setting off with a backpack, his dog and a lot of courageous ambition, Peter Jenkins, who received backing in his mission from the National Geographic Society, began a meandering trek that took him through the rural countryside of a dozen states and finally, after being adopted by a devout black family in North Carolina, surviving a tornado, the loss of his best friend, walking pneumonia, intimidations by bullying thugs, and attempts to dissuade him from finishing his planned march to the ocean, Jenkins stops for a breather in New Orleans and there meets a woman who becomes the love of his life, and in short order, his bride. This book pauses here but the story of the Jenkins' (yes, his wife begins the walk west with him) hike across the Heartland to the Oregon coast is concluded in this book's sequel. Not only is this an interesting travelogue, and not only is it also the story of America at a particular time in its history, it is the memoir of a man's transformation from cynic back to glorious idealist, and from a spiritual doubter to a spiritually living human being.spiritual doubter to a spiritually living human being.	2005-09-12

Everything in this autobiography confirms the reputation Ashe secured over his lifetime, of being a kind, modest, higher-goal-oriented human being. This is not only the story of HIS life, but of the progress those of his race have made in the world of sports and the arena of life. Ashe describes his childhood in segregated Richmond, Virginia, where his father was the groundskeeper of a \\"Negroes Only\\" park that included tennis courts. It was in this unlikely location that Ashe perfected his game to such a level he was able to play professionally among others (nearly all of whom were whites) whose training had included expensive athletic camps and decades of personalized coaching. The high point of this story comes in 1975, the year the underdog Ashe dominated the world's number one men's tennis player, the volatile Jimmy Conners, and became the first non-white to win the Gentleman's Singles Title at Wimbledon.<br /><br />If Ashe's life was full of moments that shone in history--Wimbledon, being the frist black to play professional tennis in Apartheid-era South Africa, first black coach of the US Davis Cup team--then it was also a series of sad tragedies. In the prime of his life, a man in extraordinary physical shape, Ashe suffered the first in a series of congenitally-attributable heart attacks, that lead to open heart surgery, a blood transfusion, and in the ultimate sadness, to his infection with the HIV that lead to AIDS and his untimely death.<br /><br />Ashe's intelligence, determination, his compassion and his dignity radiate from the pages of this memoir of what must be viewed as an unfinished life. It movingly concludes with a chapter in which Ashe writes an open letter to his daughter Camera, then about seven years of age. Ashe expresses his hopes for her and offers advice from his heart for this daughter he knows he will not be there to raise.<br /><br />This is a very good book but it is at all times a roller coaster of emotional ups and downs.

Let me establish that right now. The timing of this review is not a coincidence, nor are some of the issues I raise here. I'd heard of this book for a year or more and had it on my reading list but it was the hurricane last week and its illogical, merciless strike against humanity in all its 21st-century technological glory, that entrenched in my head the need to read about America's other mega-hurricane.<br /><br />We all know about the 1900 hurricane that rolled westward off the Gulf of Mexico and left Texas' most beautiful city in rubble, so I'll gratefully pass that part of this story by. What I want to say is that the scary story in this excellent book was not only the storm itself but what Isaac's tale tells us about man's helplessness. The futility of all our efforts toward an understanding of the earthly elements is the hidden theme of Isaac's Storm. Nothing mankind could manufacture in 1900 or in 2005 could prevent deadly tragedy. The thing that kept hitting me was that Isaac, in relying on the data he had to go by, didn't really make a mistake. He trusted the science of weather forecasting and the information he had, such as it was 105 years ago, all told him things were all right, that no hurricane was coming. It goes to show how little humans knew then and still know now. I don't think we'll ever control the weather or be able to predict it with total accuracy. What happened in Galveston that day was not Isaac's fault, he did not create the hurricane, but had he acted differently and listened to his own disquieting feelings and the warnings of those whose instincts were tragically correct, then 6,000 people might have had a fighting chance at life. As it was, the most horrific event I can imagine befell a modern US city whose residents paid the ultimate price for one man's faith in the science that was his god.<br /><br />The most heartbreaking of the many stories of loss in this book had to have been that of the nuns who tied a rope around the waists of the orphans in their care so the children wouldn't become separated in the hurricane. The drowned, battered bodies of these unfortunates were later found linked together when the tempest had passed. Even the descriptions Larson gave of the crematory bonfires on the corpse-littered beaches paled in horror beside the relatively small loss of the 100 or so doomed children in the convent.<br /><br />What this book demonstrated with its history was that nature is an unstoppable, unpredictable, unknowable force that will continue to bring misery into the self-confident lives of humankind, be it in 1900, 2005, or a hundred years hence. It showed that compared to the might of global forces, we are next to nothing and we will never be complete masters of our fates.uns who tied a rope around the waists of the orphans in their care so the children wouldn't become separated in the hurricane.

There was one I liked a bit and while its name escapes me, it was about a middle-age crisis in a man manifesting in his attraction to his child's babysitter and culminating in the near extinction of his marriage. Of all the tales I read in this volume, and I read better than half the total, that one was the best, and yet it, too, contained a quality of shallowness. It reminded me it and all of Cheever's short stories could have used another draft or two before they went to press.	2005-09-11

A Worm's Story	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Had More Of A Lesson In It Than Most Far Sides Did	I miss The Far Side and wish Larson would put out something new in that vein, but that doesn't mean a book like this can't be enjoyed in the meantime. Larson is a man who has always been interested in the microcosmic civilizations under rocks and logs and piles of laundry in hall closets, and here he tells a story with no less than an earthworm as its main character. Larson focuses on the moving and shaking on the unseen level that goes on in nature, all around us, all the time. He hides a fable here in this humorous story and he's right in his message: nature isn't there for us to use and abuse, we're part of something larger than we are, and unless we want some seriously bad consequences, we'd better take stock of how we humans are using the resources of our planet. That's what I felt Larson was telling us here. If you missed that part but still got some good laughs, then, hey, this creepy-goofy-witty post-Far Side maiden effort on Larson's part still delivered for you, huh?<br /><br />This book came out in 1995. I wonder why Larson's been so quiet for the last decade? Gary, I really miss you, dude!	2005-09-11

In this suspenseful drama set three years after the \\"deaths\\" of Holmes and his rival above the Swiss falls, this novel brings Moriarty back and sets him down in the midst of a city-wide turf war between his factions and those who have sprung up in his absence. Holmes is a minor character here, never seen but referred to numerous times, especially in the matter of the eventual fate of his would-be assassin, Colonel Moran. Instead of this being a tale of the greatest of Victorian detectives, this is presented as the story of his darkest foe, the ingenious crime lord Moriarty. Here one will find violence and cunning in the impoverished, crime-infested London of the 1890's. Within these pages a reader will discover why Holmes frequently stated that Moriarty was his equal in intellect. Author Gardner did an admirable quantity of research into the lifestyles and language of those who lived in the setting featured in this novel. These details contribute to a level of realism often reached for but rarely achieved in stories set in this period. This is a crime novel that has strong characters and a fast-moving plot, and anyone who has ever loved the Conan-Doyle Sherlock Holmes mysteries, or who has an interest in Victorian London--especially its criminal side--should love this book.	2005-09-11

The problem here is George had too much book and too little story with which to fill it. Not only is Mary--ultimately a tragic figure whose life was a series of one poor choice and ill-conceived plan after another--not a monarch of the same eventful scope as the politically-omnipotent Henry, but George hamstrings herself by drawing out minor or uneventful periods of Mary's life, while rushing through others that actually did contain some matters of potential interest. (For instance, the period when Mary was kept as Elizabth's prisoner went on and on, but the time she spent at the court in France--as France's Queen, no less!--wizzed past in a blur.) The result is an overly long, frequently boring book about a shallow, unwise, unfit-to-rule woman whose cradle to grave biography is more suited for a short story than an epic-length arch-novel like this one.<br /><br />When I was at last done with this time-consuming heavyweight, I remember I thought that Mary should have been a nun instead of a queen, and Margaret George should have selected someone else to feature in her sophomore novel.<br /><br />Needless to say, Mary Queen of Scotland & The Isles is a letdown of vast proportions.	2005-09-11

The most sexist, biased, silly, unfounded, unhelpful waste of time to come from a publishing house in many a moon. This supposed relationship enhancer is the biggest example of playing with a loaded gun since the serpent in the Garden of Eden offered marriage advice to Eve. I know this is now a cult hit but I wonder how many relationships this exercise in stereotyping has busted up? Gray would have us accept that humans are without variation walking examples of either Martians or Venuvians. JMJ, but who on earth falls for this hogswallow? Apparently a lot of people by the sales numbers.<br /><br />Gray would like to make us think all men are confrontation-seeking warriors who reason at waist level. (Actually only half of that statement is true.) He makes a case that men dwell on this plane to spread their DNA, make quick, simple decisions and scratch themselves in public. Women, the less than sage Gray wants it know, are emotion-driven machines turned on and off by nesting instincts, the desire for endless communication and a snuggly need for flattery and security. We are supreme manipulators employing sex as the coin of the realm in the marketplace of romance.<br /><br />This book has all the depth of a three-panel Sunday comic strip.<br /><br />Unfortunately rather than going through the talk show circuit and dying a natural death in the 1990's, I saw a new edition of this was out since the one I read for a class. \\"Updated!\\" it proclaimed. What, Gray's going to admit we've evolved a little and are now in the stone age instead of the protoplasmic mating pool he seemed to think we all lived in when he first tossed this inflammatory little cartoon on us?<br /><br />Yeah, this book makes me miffed. Not much but enough to invest ten minutes in slamming it in a review. I could laugh it off but the fact it's given credibility is what bugs me when I take a moment to think about it. So, once I'm done reviewing this, I won't think about this book again. See, watch: What am I thinking about now? Something else.h: What am I thinking about now? Something else.	2005-09-11

Amanda Wilson lived in Cincinnati, Ohio (then the nation's sixth-largest city and second-busiest inland port) during the time of the American Civil War, and her meticulously-kept diary records her life during this frightening period. Wilson, an upper-middle class woman of early middle age, worked from her home on behalf of the American war effort, sewing, attending charitable functions, and worrying over the safety and health of her brother, who enlisted as an officer in an Ohio infantry regiment that frequently saw combat in the eastern theater of operations. Wilson writes of the rising cost of basic necessities during the war years, tells tidbits of gossip and news as they filter in from the front lines, and in relating the stuff of her daily life, she provides a fine, well-rounded impression of what a woman's life on the homefront in a border city was like. Later in the diary, Mrs. Wilson tells the news of her brother's death in the center of the Union lines at Chancellorsville, and the pain of her grief radiates from the pages with so much honest sorrow that this loss in a war long part of history is almost as touching as the news of a modern-day passing.<br /><br />Exactly why this diary is not more well-known puzzles me, because in its excellently-written detail it more than holds its own against such Civil War diaries as that of Mary Chesnut, a southern counterpart of Mrs. Wilson. The edition I read was a reference copy held in non-circulating ownership by the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County. I think what this fine work needs to boost its popularity (and make the reading public more aware of its very existence) is a new, annotated version to be mass produced in the near future. Amanda Wilson was too extraordinary a person for her legacy to be stifled by her relative state of unknown: particularly here in her hometown.	2005-09-11

It's a good kind of tale for distancing yourself from reality. It's never heavy and never silly. What it lacks in depth (a la Lord of the Rings) it makes up for in imaginative charm.<br /><br />This is a fantasy genre book, as in magic and spells and Medieval-ish setting and all that. Xanth is a Florida-shaped land in another dimension wherein everyone has a magic \\"talent\\". Some people have minor talents, others have talents so major they rate as a wizard or a sourceress. Some talents are technically useless, others can kill. The law of magic-based Xanth also states that anyone who does not eventually demonstrate that they possess some form of magic talent, is to be exiled forever from the borders of this magic realm, into a frighteningly awful place called \\"Mundania\\" (aka our world).<br /><br />The main character, Bink, is nearing the age of exile and in all his life he's never shown any inkling of owning claim to a magical ability of any sort. Fearing exile, which in many cases in a world full of dragons, bloodthirsty tangle trees and goblins, is as good as a death sentence, Bink makes a pilgrimage to the castle of a venerable wizard famed for his talent of providing an answer to any question asked of him. The catch is that in return for the answer, the person visiting the wizard must provide one year of unpaid slave labor. Bink consults with the wizard and is told that while he certainly does possess a talent--and apparently a mighty one--the wizard cannot fathom what that talent is.<br /><br />Even the word of a wizard is not good enough in the eyes of the law, and lacking the ability to publicly demonstrate his magical aptitude, Bink is exiled to Mundania, a hideously boring place full of people so daft they think magic is the stuff of fairy stories. And THERE is where this transporting little tale really takes off...<br /><br />This gentle, sometimes innuendo-heavy fantasy story is pleasantly remembered by me and I think almost anyone will agree it's an enjoyable investment of a handful of hours... <br /> <br />This gentle, sometimes innuendo-heavy fantasy story is pleasantly remembered by me and I think almost anyone will agree it's an enjoyable investment of a handful of hours.	2005-09-11

This is a sort of \\"rule book\\" for the game of Catholic life. Anyone within or outside the faith can easily find answers to questions about what Catholicism teaches is right and wrong. In the process this admirably useful and straightforward work can readily dispel many persistant myths about the world's largest and most frequently misunderstood religion. I joked to friends in high school, about the time this first revision of catechism in 400 years came out, that unless we read this book \\"how are we going to know what we should stop doing?\\" But there's much more than that to the catechism. This is akin to a written constitution for a religion founded in stages of revelation and fits of growth spurts that lasted in some cases for centuries. Is it the all-time final word on Catholic beliefs? Probably not. But for this present age it is exactly the document needed for the education of the world in which the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church resides.	2005-09-10

Something about its 1950's New England setting and cast that all came together to make it important to me. I loved its message of unconventionality and personal freedom of expression. I liked the new worlds the teacher, Mr. Keating, said poetry could open up to a reader. Time passed, I kind of got away from DPS (a film I sadly outgrew) and it wasn't until many years later as I was cruising the book section of a thrift store that I came upon the novel to this movie. Remembering the way this timelessly inspirational story used to make me happy, I bought the book and read it in one sitting. For anyone who was ever touched by Dead Poet's Society I recommend this book. To anyone else, skip it, there's not a lot here for you: no new characters, same sad ending, same time, same place. Dead Poet's Society the book reads exactly like a director's cut extended version of the Peter Weir movie, including in its length a handful of scenes the film never contained. It also has a few lines that were spicier than the dialogue in the motion picture and there's a stronger suggestion of exactly what Charlie 'Newanda' Dalton got up to with those college-age girls from town he brought to the Dead Poet's meeting that one night. I still have this little novel and I'm glad I bought it. I only wish I'd owned it back in the day when Dead Poet's Society was among my favorite movies.	2005-09-09

I think most anyone would agree with Mr. Trump that the America he describes within this book would be an ideal nation. The problem is, Donald Trump does not know anymore than anyone else about how to achieve the problems he very practically identifies. The math of what's lacking in this book could be described with an equation like this: A+X=C. A is where we are today in the America we have, C is the \\"America we deserve\\" now what is X that would get us to C? I have no idea. I wish someone knew.<br /><br />But as far as Trump's observations go, he is frequently correct and in his \\"idealistic pragmatism\\" he has an observant eye when it comes to citing certain less than ideal, even intolerable, situations.<br /><br />I liked Trump's comment that money is not the key to fixing America's education system. He demonstrated how in real dollars we spend more on education these days than in the recent past and yet see less achievement in return. His biting, dead-on observation that the teachers' union's position that salary increases for classroom instructors would elevate teachers' performances is akin to them saying, \\"Bribe us more and we'll agree to put more effort into the job we're already taking money to try our hardest at now.\\"<br /><br />VERY good point!<br /><br />Trump was also correct in this 1999 book in foreseeing another terrorist attack on New York City that would make the 1993 World Trade Center attack seem minor. That predicition came tragically true on September 11, 2001. His warnings to prepare for further attacks are more true in 2005 than they were in the Clinton Years. As I'm writing this, Hurricane Katrina is in the headlines and the lack of coordinated management in helping its victims shows how unprepared this mighty nation truly is for disasters of a monumental scale. I'm sure our ever-patient foes are learning from this and I hope we Americans are as well.<br /><br />But lest I come across as doling out more praise to Donald Trump than his book, sound though it is, merits, I have to come around to the fact that Trump's critial troubleshooting does not contain enough suggestions of how to improve the things he says are wrong. He's a smart man, not without faults, but he understands how business operates and I wish he had provided more insights in this book into how we can reach the hypothetical point C that would be the United States he takes delight in describing in his writings.is book, sound though it is, merits, I have to come around to the fact that Trump's critial troubleshooting does not contain enough suggestions of how to improve the things he says are wrong.

When Cantor is getting it right in this book, he treats us to a rocking, rolling festival of Medieval delights. The problem is, moments like these come too infrequently and account for a small percentage of this book. Oh, I'm not going to rag on Cantor here, he is a skilled researcher and a capable writer but he falls into the trap of hanging history up to dry a bit before he serves it. He loses much of the color and texture to his subject when he imposes an unnecessary distance between his reader and the lost world that we are seeking to access. What you have in this book is a sound read brimming with facts, but it never loses that \\"old-fashioned history book\\" tone. Cantor is clearly too awed by the Medieval period to try to touch it and instead of mentally entering western civilization's most interesting thousand years, we have to see it standing far back, like tourists stuck next to the bus. That's why the top rating, five stars, eludes this feast of facts and speculation.	2005-09-09

It is sometimes compared to the later Homerian works of ancient Greece, but the importance of those pieces to westerners does not come close to matching the significance of this poem to Hindus.<br /><br />The Mahabharata is many things: morality fable, history, inspirational tall tale, religious discourse, literary masterpiece and national epic. It tells of the lives of members of two feuding, inter-related families, whose fortunes rise and fall over the course of many years. In its verses, gods come to earth to speak with men, heroes and villains share center stage, and in the end the largest battle ever fought on the subcontient is waged. (60,000 war elephants along with several million other assorted troops.)<br /><br />I personally found this poem dismaying to my western mind but also interesting. It does have long boring stretches, especially in the Krishna sermons (in which the great battle is suspended so the blue-skinned warrior-god may speak to a single man) but its soap opera-like tales of the wavering fortunes of the characters at its heart should be sufficiently vibrant to hold the interest of dedicated readers.	2005-09-09

To read a play is to be faced with the power of dialogue to make or break a story. In Amadeus, author Peter Shaffer uses the spoken word to full effect. He takes a sand-grain of historical truth and lets it build in layers to the pearl it becomes in fiction. In this story, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, future legend and his own lifetime the most celebrated composer in late-18th century Vienna, turns out compositions of sheer genius, almost, it seems to his rival, the mediocre Antonio Salieri, without effort. Salieri is a man who has risen from modest beginning to reach his post of court composer to the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, and he recognizes in the earthy, profane Mozart, a superior, though in his regard undeserving talent. Where Saleri is devout, Mozart is licentious. Where Saleri must strain for hours to compose a small lackluster tune, Mozart extemporaneously flings celebrated music at the world. What begins as intoxicated admiration of Salieri toward the younger newcomer ripens to darkest envy and eventually to hatred. Salieri vows to destroy Mozart and punish God for making a creature of hedonistic depravity the instrument of Heavenly music. Salieri, once God's most obedient, modest servant turns into a conniving, plotting caricature of his former self. He stalks Mozart and awaits his chance to strike his revenge. In this way, by being universally known as Mozart's murderer, Salieri has confidence that in the end he will defeat God by forever linking his name to Mozart's--a victim and his destroyer. In this way he will share in the fame God in His gift gave Mozart. And yet, there is one last twist to Shaffer's story, for it is after all God Salieri is challenging here, not merely the flesh and blood Mozart, and in the closing seconds of the final act, it is God who plays the final hand to very crafty effect.nal hand to very crafty effect.	2005-09-09

The very things we have come to see as mundane about ourselves are the very traits Morrison zeroes in on here. Very little escapes this careful study, although in some cases humanity might collectively wish it had. In this book the human species is anatomically, psychologically, sociologically and biologically cataloged and classified. We read a dispassionate critique of our mating habits, the ways in which we raise our young, our preferences for foods, for where we live, for how we interact with one another, and what bodily features are universally desired over others. In the end I was left both amazed and embarrassed to be among the membership in this great and crazed life form.	2005-09-09

This Arab gentleman set out for the holy city of Mecca in about the year  1327, and he continued his journeys for the next quarter-century, traveling a total of about 75,000 miles! Ibn Battuta was not only an intrepid traveler, he was also, luckily for posterity, a skilled writer whose memoirs of his voyages abroad make for the read of a lifetime. Battuta's trek took him across Africa, Russia, India, China, Europe, Persia and the so-called Holy Land, as well as Mecca and vast portions of the Arabian peninsula. Those he meets, those with whom he trades, those he and his companions feared, loved, hated and looked on with fascination, they are all described in this absolutely authentic record of a journey across the surface of the known 14th century world.

A woman afraid of men and relationships related details of a past incarnation in which she endured disgusting abuse at the hands of a man. Another patient suffered from a crippling fear of heights and saw himself dying after a fall while working on the roof of a Medieval church. Still another among the dozen or so patients whose case histories Dr. Fiore details here, felt his modern-day indecision could be traced to having suffered the consequences of making poor personal choices in several past lives.<br /><br />This book covers a subject I've always found deeply absorbing and does a good job of describing both the process of regressing a patient to what may be a past life remembered in the subconscious, and also the effects of past life incidents on the present life.<br /><br />Have we all lived other lives on this earth? I wish I knew. It's certainly an attractive concept. (And in its implications a daunting one.)	2005-09-09

I think this was written in the '70's and its science is by now highly out of date. (\\"Ruby Laser Rings\\"?) This story about the rise of the antichrist during the Biblical end times begins with all the Christians suddenly vanishing from the face of the earth, and yet those remaining don't quite catch on that it's the Rapture. They wander around puzzled about the disappearances until a charismatic leader appears on the scene to take over the world and usher in a reign of darkness. The main characters here, a trio of dumb-as-post agnostics soon to turn true believers, begin as loyal henchmen of the politically popular antichrist (a sort of '70's smooth operator with fundamentalist-rankling leftist tendencies) but eventually repent and take it on the lam as they work underground against him and his evil administration. There are wars here, execution scenes straight out of A Tale Of Two Cities, political messages wrapped in Christian dogma, and even a resurrection from the dead achieved in a science-meets-arcane-magick stunt that puts the antichrist on a divine plateau. Finally there is the anticipated good v. evil showdown, Jesus ushers in the new world, blahblahblah, and the faithful get their reward, the rest swan dive into eternal pain and suffering, courtesy of an all-loving God.<br /><br />This well-meaning, sensationalistic book cracks me up.	2005-09-09

I don't get the whole cult of royal worship and never have. The peoples of the United Kingdom financially support the Queen so she can supposedly be better than they are? What's that about? In HM's defense, even under Kelley's scathing microscope, she comes across as a morally honest person who does the duty into which she was born. If only those around her were as circumspect, then there might be kinder things to say about the family some bitingly refer to as Britain's richest welfare-recipients. My favorite bit of gossip--and mean-spirited gossip IS pretty much all this alleged tell-all offers--was the little ditty about how Princess Elizabeth, currently Her Majesty the Queen, had to have her dresses let out several times during WWII due to her pudginess, even though the Times daily reported the menus of meals at Buckingham Palace that would have loyal Englishmen believe the royals were suffering right along with their countrymen on cabbage soup and other such rationed wartime fare.<br /><br />Oh, please!<br /><br />The royal family of Great Britain are human beings and no more or less perfect at heart than anyone else. I read nothing here to make me think they are immoral and nothing to make me think for even one fleeting second that they are in any way superior to the average man or woman on the street.<br /><br />As for Kitty Kelley, don't you ever say anything nice about the subjects of your mean-spirited books?

Okay, I'm joking, it's not about that, but it's good advice given the outcome of this book. What I liked in Flint was the obvious familiarity the author had with the landscape in which the tale was set. This was not some invented location, the lava fields and mesas of this rugged New Mexico county exist and L'Amour visited them. That was a nice touch. I also empathized with Jim Flint's plight as his death-wishing bravado in the early part of the story leads him to love and a renewed passion for life, only to have to deal with the circumstances his unwise cavalier behavior has gotten him into. This is a morality play with an old west flavor, a tale of a man's fall and rise, and most of all it is about personal salvation being found from within. Those are highly universal themes. The ten gallon hats, six shooters and frontier bar fronts are just extras to the internal plot about resurrection.	2005-09-09

If you thought Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot was funny, you ain't seen nothing yet! This is a hilarious book that does the neat trick of letting those whom Franken chooses to target mock themselves with their own comments, antics and inane stupidity. I hate the way America is so viciously divided, but since it is and since the right has spent years attacking the left, it's good to see those left of center fire back: and do it so well! The best chapter in here has to be the one about Bob Jones University, home of a ban on inter-racial dating, where Franken, on a visit to campus, poses the question \\"Who would Tiger Woods be allowed to date if he went here?\\" That chapter alone made this book worth buying! FOX News, Talk Radio, right-wing columnists, elected officials (and their mothers) no one is safe from from former SNL-guru Franken's biting satire.

I'm actually a vegetarian, the polar opposite of low-carb. The thing I have to say is that for many people a low carbohydrate diet plan works well, but the problem I saw at the height of the low-carb craze of 2003 was that people really had no understanding of how Dr. Atkins' diet worked or what it required of them. Too many dieters believed that if they merely incorporated some elements of low-carb into their lives or abstained from eating as many carbohydrate-laden foods as they would normally have eaten, that was all they needed to do.<br /><br />Totally not true! And that's one major reason so many people ended up disgruntled with Atkins and his diet.<br /><br />The fact is, this diet plan begins with an induction whereby the participant is asked to temporarily (generally for a two week period) limit carbohydrate intake to a mere twenty grams per day, to be increased in small increments once induction is complete. This would allow the dieter's body to enter a fat-burning state of ketosis and that is the real factor in this diet's success or failure.<br /><br />My father went on Atkins in late 2002, months before the real craze hit and I knew little about it and was concerned for him because of all the urban legend type bad press I'd heard. So I read this book, was impressed by what Atkins had to say, and made sure my father read it too. As a result, he did the diet \\"right\\" felt great, lost his targeted twenty pounds, and has nothing but good to say about the Atkins' diet or this book. If everyone who claimed to be on \\"low-carb\\" truly had been and had educated themselves instead of listening to hearsay and relying on guesswork, maybe their results would have been just as positive as my father's.<br /><br />So if you're going to do low-carbohydrate, find out the real way to do it right by reading this book!<br /><br />Okay, I'm done. I hope my two-cents here might help someone.	2005-09-09

This in no way diminishes the regard I have for this novel but it did come as a surprise. Having said that, I'll add that McCrumb's story about the connection a modern-day rural sheriff draws between the Silver hanging and the impending execution of a possibly innocent young man he helped send to death row two decades before, is an exercise in intricate storytelling and succeeds in every way.<br /><br />Truthfully the modern story was of far less interest to me than the facts concerning the Frankie Silver case, which the sheriff researches while recovering from gunshot wounds received in the line of duty. Silver was a tragic figure, clearly marrying too young and to the wrong man. She suffered from what would in 21st century terms be classified as \\"battered woman's syndrome\\" and she took her drunken boor of a husband's life in defense of her infant daughter, Nancy. But all this made no difference to a jury in antebellum North Carolina, whose unanimous verdict was that the Bible prescribes only one punishment for a woman who strikes down her lawful husband. One thought this engendered in me was, \\"Man, we've come a long way, and for the better!\\" Anyone who says today's legal system is too lenient on criminals and who seeks a return to the old days when they \\"had it right\\" should consider the matter of Frankie Silver, who found little justice in her treatment at the hands of the courts.<br /><br />This is both a sad novel and a frustrating one. The outcomes of both cases at its heart, the Silver murder trial and the modern one which concerns the slaying of young lovers on the Appalachian Trail, have the power to emotionally upset a sensitive reader. In McCrumb's hands, this plot has all the colorful intricacy of an antique patchwork quilt, and all the force of a tragedy we all wish we could undo.y we all wish we could undo.	2005-09-09

This is the version of this work to have, in my opinion, far better than the endless, text-only editions of this we had to wade through in theology classes in high school.

Her accident in the 1975 televised match race against Foolish Pleasure must have been truly heartbreaking to witness, and merely reading a description about it with the preparatory knowledge of hindsight goes a long way toward moving me to tears every time.<br /><br />This book tells the sadly-brief life story of the greatest filly in thoroughbred history: maybe the greatest racehorse of all time. Ruffian broke record after record in her two-year career and whatsmore, she carried herself with the pride of a being who knows of her greatness. Ruffian's grace and glory came not just from winning her races, but from the almost arrogant confidence with which she ran down any horse whose misfortune it was to be on the same track with her. She was the once-per-century embodiment of utter perfection in her species, and many believe she, with her massive size and \\"flawless\\" stride, could have outrun even the legendary Man O' War.<br /><br />And yet, in one of life's greatest ironies and certainly thoroughbred racing's most horrid tragedies, this magnificent filly suffered a terrible accident mid-way through her most celebrated race, breaking one of her front legs and necessitating her destruction. She alone of the hundreds of thousands of horses who have run at the track in the past century, is buried in the infield of Belmont Park, scene of her final start. A last race, it should be noted, in which she was leading Kentucky Derby winner Foolish Pleasure, and continuing to draw away at the moment of her fatal injury.<br /><br />Jane Schwartz has written a labor of love and tells a story with such force she all-but returns Ruffian to us across thirty years. Her book is sad, as the story of Ruffian, once a tale filled with so much glory and promise, must of necessity be, but it is also a tribute to the spirit and memory of a true athletic champion.	2005-09-08

Hofmann gives his creation, his \\"problem child\\" mixed reviews, and is both somewhat proud of his achievement and angry at its misuse and the close-mindedness to it on behalf of international health agencies and governments. Hofmann advocates its further testing and remains hopeful that LSD in its benign uses may benefit the psychologically unwell.<br /><br />One of the funnier chapters in this book tells of when Hofmann, after synthesizing lysergic acid diethylamide for the first time, basically licked the glass tool he was using to stir the chemicals, and then attempted to ride his bicycle home for dinner, unknowingly having just ingested the equivalent of perhaps a hundred-thousand hits of acid. Poor man!<br /><br />I think this informative book is a worthwhile read for anyone scientifically minded. Reading it did not turn me into an acid freak (never taken it, never will) and it allowed me a beautiful moment in 1999, when I was able to correct my former boyfriend's snotty know-it-all momentary girlfriend, who haughtily declared that tired urban myth that Walt Disney's Fantasia is so visually colorful because Disney was on LSD when he made it. I asked her in the sweetest voice possible how Disney was on LSD when Fantasia was released in 1940 and Hofmann wouldn't even invent LSD for several more years.<br /><br />The look on her smug face as she (for once) shut up was worth the hours reading \\"Problem Child\\" took.	2005-09-08

I started reading this and other of Shel Silverstein's books when I was about four or five and to this day I have never \\"outgrown\\" him. I mean, who can? His rhymes and poems, songs and riddles, they all work for everybody with half a degree of imagination. The most cursory read of Where The Sidewalk Ends will show you not only how good/funny/imaginative/likable/silly/deep Silverstein is (sigh, was...) but you'll catch on to why he was so darn cool. This man was close personal friends with Roman Catholic Cardinals, hippies, rabbis, other poets, songwriters, and no less an icon than Hef, himself. (Shel practically lived the whole 1970's at the Playboy Mansion.) A little known fact is, Shel Silverstein even wrote a little song for his buddy Johnny Cash called \\"A Boy Named Sue\\".  Ever heard of it? And of everything Shel wrote, the many books out there, I think this one MIGHT just be his best.<br /><br />Or, wait...no, maybe it's The Light In The Attic.<br /><br />No, no....maybe it's actually The Giving Tree....<br /><br />Maybe? Maybe it was Falling Up?<br /><br />I can never decide. One thing I do know and that's Where The Sidewalk Ends is Silverstein at his most awesome!	2005-09-08

Virtually all segments of the population, from lowest to highest, are described here, as are numerous aspects of the goings-on that kept a bustling city moving. This is not a work for romantics, it is a serious, fairly in-depth examination of the social and occupational structure of this era in European history. Medieval life could be brutal but it also had its shades of beauty. True a modern person may recoil at much of what a person from 800 years ago accepted without a thought, but the reverse might also be true. What I liked so much about this book was it refused to be the typical general study of a vast time and place and never strayed from its goal of shedding light strictly within the  confines of a city and those who lived there, worked there, or came there for festival or for trade. Everything from clothing to food to tools to crime and punishment, religion and medicine are covered here. This is really a very fine book.	2005-09-08

All this basically happened? The implications of what almost came to pass right under the complacency of modern human society should be a wakeup call to every government, every scientist, every person alive today. This planet is long overdue for a pandemic on the scale of the 1918 Spanish Flu or even, frankly, the Black Death, and this tells the scenario by which it might come about. This is NOT a pleasant story, but then again hiding our collective heads in the sand isn't going to get us anyplace, either.

Now imagine that correcting this hazard was not only simple but relaxing and already on-hand. If that was the case, you'd change your ways, right? Well, there is in fact strong evidence--I'd almost call it proof--that modern Americans are gradually killing themselves via long-term sleep deprivation, and we need to be aware of the problems we are causing ourselves, right now!<br /><br />Fact: the average American adult just 100 years ago spent 9.5 hours of every 24 hours asleep. The average American adult in the year 2000 slept just 6.2 hours per night.<br /><br />If your answer to those statistics is, \\"So what?\\" you definitely need to read this book.<br /><br />The cold hard fact seems to be this: human beings were (pick your choice here) A) designed by God; B) evolved in nature; C) grew used over hundreds of generations to spending perhaps as much as half their lives asleep. Certainly even by the most conservative of views, we humans need to sleep at least a third of our existence. How many of us get even eight hours a night anymore? Sadly only about one in six. It's only been in the last 5-6 generations, since the advent of electrical lighting, that humans have shifted away from the natural day/night, sleep/wake cycles by which our species was regulated. Is it coincidental that it is also in that time period we have seen this massive onset of catastrophic illnesses (especially mental illness) in record breaking numbers? No. Nor is sleep the only factor in the escalation of catastrophic illness, but it is one large piece in the puzzle. More than likely human beings simply have not had time to adjust in the course of a hundred years or so to massives changes in the sleep cycles their forebears spent perhaps ten-thousand generations acclimating themselves to.<br /><br />Sleep is the time of healing, of unwinding, of our body producing mood-regulating hormones such as melatonin (which can ONLY be manufactured in total darkness and only during one specific segment of the nightly sleep cycle).  A lack of sufficient sleep interrupts the production of insulin, testosterone, estrogen, seratonin, can lead to diabetes, obesity, depression, heart disease, cancer, senility, infertility, and a laundry list of other medically-incontrovertible health crises, including, paradoxically, sleep apnea!<br /><br />And yet we modern Americans continue to stay up nights, working on computers, watching television, reading, burning the proverbial midnight oil, even while our culture reels under the effects of an epidemic of disease, mental illness and seemingly perpetual malaise. It is even said that one automobile accident in seven is related to \\"drowsy driver syndrome\\" a contributing factor in as many as 3,000 highway deaths and 30,000 injuries annually!<br /><br />Nothing that can be written in the space of a brief review can do justice to the overpowering weight of argument, study, fact, and anecdotal testimony presented by Wiley in her excellent, frightening book.

After reading this book I came away feeling Mrs. King deserves praise for her own role in her peoples' struggle and her husband's achievements.

I realize that since this future saint died last spring he's achieved a status so elevated in popular regard that breathing one tiny word of dissent about him merits roughly the same mouth-frothing negative reaction from his supporters that a certain Irish singer got back in the day when she ripped up his picture on TV. Therefore, I expect the arrival of the Inquisition at my humble abode the minute I hit \\"POST\\" on this review. But I'll take my chances.<br /><br />Parts of the message in Crossing the Threshold of Hope were matters of opinion and therefore beyond logical criticism. Published in a question and answer format, the Pope tells his views on the future of Christianity in the face of rising Islam, of the role of women, of the struggle for basic human rights.<br /><br />All that is fine. Even interesting.<br /><br />Then later, the Pope slipped in something that made me question his acuity. Somewhere in this early-90's work the late Pontiff declared that if he could bring all the messages of his life and Papacy and make them into one statement it would be this: \\"Fear not!\\"<br /><br />And yet...what kind of advice for all of us was that? I think he meant why concern ourselves with the fleeting travails of earthly life when eternity can await? Well...that's all well and good, but you know, fear is there for a reason and to disregard it is naive, not to mention impossible. A human without fear is not a healthy person. We do not have the luxury of dwelling in a palace and being waited on hand and foot. Some of us have very real worries to cause us fear. We might be plucked from our homes to go face dismemberment in Iraq. We might have to worry about finding money for the mortgage, about paying the bills to the same Catholic schools where the Pope's feel-good homilies are still unquestionably accepted like they're the word of God Himself. We have to live in fear of crime, because we have no Swiss Guards. We have to worry about money, because we are not head of a major private banking institution. We have many things to fear, and if \\"Be Not Afraid!\\" is the totality of John Paul's central message, then by the early 1990's, this man who had hidden from Nazis and had brutal Soviet atheists pounding on his church door, had forgotten what the real world was like. Therefore, I question the worthiness of much of anything else he had to say.<br /><br />To be blunt, I was given a copy of this book years ago by a priest when my grandmother was critically ill and I read it, only to find it to be insultingly bad and without much relevance to her suffering or my family's sadness. I felt like throwing this out a window but instead I left it on a hospital bench for someone else to find. Maybe it did them some good if one-dimensional spiritualism was what they sought. It filled me with anger at the hollow message of the leader of my hereditary religion.<br /><br />\\"Be Not Afraid!\\"? Why not?<br /><br />Sorry, but Threshold is theology for simpletons.n.

Condensed to a description, this book sounds like a winner. But try resting all dozen pounds of it on your chest in bed at night and trying to stay awake to get to the heart of this investigation beyond the myth of '50's nostalgia. This is not light reading, this is sandpaper for the human spirit. I found some German philosophers lighter than David Halberstam. I kid you not.<br /><br />Halberstam is probably correct in most of what he has to say about the middle decade of the century just completed, but it's HOW he says it that drags this from a five-star rating to a three. Yes, he's done his research well, and yes, inarguably the whole 1950's was like some nationwide pressure cooker waiting to explode into political protests and civil rights struggles and gender role debates, but in the heavy-handed touch of this author, getting to that message was like looking for a poodle lost in freshly poured cement.	2005-09-08

I'm the sort of person who likes to go along content in the moment when I'm reading a book or seeing a movie and I don't like to guess ahead or try to figure an ending out. I suppose I like surprises. And surprised I was here, I admit. This is one of two Stoner (that's the main character's name, folks, not his proclivity) books I've read, and it's every bit as good as the other, Day of Wrath.<br /><br />One of the more endearing things Valin does in his mysteries is he sets them in places that really exist. Little to nothing in the setting seems invented to me, including the location where this tale starts off: the Hyde Park Branch of the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County. That's somewhere I've visited numerous time, myself. At the branch library, some inconsiderate wanker is slicing the eyes out of the pictures of various women in books and magazines. The head librarian summons Stoner to investigate. While the librarian thinks this vandalism was more of someone's idea of a rude prank, Stoner's instincts are stirred to another direction. What begins as a minor matter becomes the pursuit of a psychopathic sex killer and takes a reader on a chase through a number of Queen City landmarks including the Eden Park Overlook. (In this book, the Overlook is the scene of so brutal a killing it makes me unconsciously look for bloodstains on the sidewalk every time I go rock climbing in the park.)<br /><br />Valin is a talented mystery writer and Stoner is one of the more human and believable characters in \\"detective\\" fiction. The combination of deft storytelling, fine characters and (for me) a hometown connection makes reading Valin's mysteries an ever-enjoyable pastime.	2005-09-08

Perishing a self-inflicted death about a decade before her status left that of human and became one of icon, I've often wondered what Plath would have made of the image she has become in the minds of so many fanatical devotees. In this book, one might be able to set aside the burden of background and concentrate solely on Plath the poet. Or more correctly: Plath's poetry.<br /><br />Devoid the legend (largely, I think, created from wholecloth by a generation in need of a martyred antihero) one is left with a body of writings that emcompasses a novel (The Bell Jar) and the several hundred poems collected here, all written by Plath over the period of about ten years. What is instantly clear is that Plath was a poet of her era. Her range may have grown with time--time she did not allow herself to possess--but within her life she never strayed from her caste or delivered up a poem that was other than the sort in vogue in the mid-twentieth century.<br /><br />Sometimes Plath, the poet, wrote memorable, moving pieces, at other times she was not beyond turning out fluff. A few poems within her body of work are downright incomprehensible. Just a few are truly genius, such as \\"Lady Lazarus\\" and \\"Mushrooms\\". Her description of her favorite horse, Ariel, as \\"the great lioness of God\\" is somehow more personal and touching than ten pages worth of her death-centered bitter screaming.<br /><br />From what we in the public know of her (or think we do) Plath was clearly a soul in anguish, and yet, I began to wonder, if these poems were all we had to go by, if we did not know the story behind these works, if we didn't go into her output prescient of her selfish suicide, would we still understand what she was saying? I think we might not.<br /><br />This is a collection of uneven merit. At moments it ranges into heights and depths bespeaking of mastery of language and art, at other times I was left wondering if in raiding the notebooks of a dead woman, the editors did not include works plath would never have intended anyone to see.ring if in raiding the notebooks of a dead woman, the editors did not include works plath would never have intended anyone to see.	2005-09-07

It seemed hurried and shallow and had it been slightly longer I think it would have benefitted from greater exploration of the daily life in these times. This book is still worth reading and is yet another feather in its author's cap. In other hands this would probably be a book I'd speak of with more praise and less nitpicking, but knowing as I do what McCullough is capable of in top form, I recognized that this book was slightly sub-par for an historian and writer of his talents.<br /><br />I do, however, look forward to his next book, which I'll be sure to pre-order, as I did 1776.	2005-09-07

I understand he went on to take his own life. That's a shame, but honestly I can kind of see the suicidal mindset in him if the man he writes about in the first-person in these is a real reflection of how he truly thought. He was a grouch and mean-spirited to the people around him. He clearly thought he was smarter than everybody else and his writings show he probably wasn't. A lot of people say this book is original but it's not, it's more like...typical midling-talent hack writing with countercultural, back-to-earth themes. He wanted to shock and tease and praise a simple life all at once and be non-tactfully frank about certain things to the point of grossness, and that's not my cup o' tea. Other than the poignant \\"childhood Kool-Aid\\" piece, the only part I liked in any of these books was in \\"Trout Fishing\\" when Brautigan caught a humpbacked fish whose odd manner of swimming he compared to Lord Byron's limp. Even that wasn't spectacular. Also, his wife should have left him over all the mean things he said about her. She must've been a saint to put up with him. I honestly don't see why any of these books make for good reading. They're a waste of time.<br /><br />(If by some cosmic chance you ever happen to read this review, Zik, wherever the heck you are in this decade, sorry I lied about liking this but I didn't want to be rude about your favorite book.

Also, don't forget, this is FICTION, folks, fiction. Made up. Don't let it change your outlook on reality because you're not really being initiated into a secret; and also don't let it rile you up in unnecessary defense of Christianity--Christianity will survive this book.

A few years after I first read this novel, my family moved and I discovered it was also, by a nice coincidence, one of the favorite books of a girl I met in our new neighborhood, who went on to be my best friend to this very day.  That connection, too, makes this a special read. However you might come to possess this wonderful book, I think you'll agree, it's one to be cherished.<br /><br />King of the Wind is the story of a mute boy named Agba, who lives works in the royal stables in Morocco during the eighteenth century, where the Sultan has perhaps the finest collection of horses on earth: maybe the greatest ever in history. Among the animals Agba cares for is a colt who has long been Agba's favorite. This horse was born with a mark called the wheat ear, that is regarded among Moroccans as so unlucky, custom mandates that any foal possessing it be destroyed at once. However, this colt also is marked by a sign of extraordinary good fortune, which reprieves the death sentence and is there to battle the wheat ear in the animal's life: the good in constant yin/yang conflict with the bad.<br /><br />As a gesture of goodwill, the all-powerful Sultan elects to send a shipment of his finest horses to his friend and ally, King George of England. As the horses chosen for the journey are prepared, Agba is given the chance to accompany these prized animals by ship to the far-off Christian kingdom.  One of the colts hand-picked by his Excellency is none other than the omen-marked horse Agba has grown to love.

Leo the Late Bloomer is another in the vast series of books that made my childhood the happy time it was. I know it has a message about bolstering self esteem and being special in who you are, and in feeling confident that if you wait and do your best, your unique talents will blossom before the world, but you know, twenty years later none of that matters a hill of beans to me. What I seriously recall most is that is the colors in Leo are simply wonderful. I'd sit in my cozy miniature chair with the fluffy orange \\"fur\\" on it and I'd stare rapt at the vivid, semi-fluorescent day-glo colors of the flowers, of the tiger's fur, of the birds, of what seemed like every part of this genuinely captivating picture book. In terms of visuals alone, this book will draw any child straight into it. Staring at this used to do something positive to my three-year-old brain and make me happy. I'm being serious. Get this for a 3-4-5 year old and watch what they do. I bet dollars to donuts they stare at the colors and sit with their face about an inch off the page.<br /><br />I don't know what it is about Leo The Late Bloomer, but it connects somehow with the visual/emotional/cognitive centers of the young mind in a way I personally can't remember any other book quite achieving.	2005-09-05

Ellie and the Anarchist Cookbook: a 100% not made up cautionary tale.<br /><br />In college, when I, perhaps the most non-radical, rule-obeying first year student imaginable, initially heard of this book, I was instantly curious and wanted to see a copy. Since no one I knew in the staid Clintonian Age had a this '60's how-to masterpiece, there were two choices open to my inquiring young mind: get it offline (a choice made less attractive by an older, \\"wiser\\" friend's claim that the CIA, NSC, or some other alphabetically-monikered \\"gummit\\" agency would track me down and deprogram me) or go get it at one of the seedier head shops in the Boston area where the book was neither rare nor pricey to obtain.<br /><br />I chose the later.<br /><br />Five hours after setting off one chilly Saturday with a packed lunch and the proceeds of my latest scholarship living allowance in hand, I landed in that Mecca of New England sordidness, and within a few more minutes, I owned a copy of this legendary source of knowledge and dangerous \\"truths\\".<br /><br />Wow was I pumped! However...<br /><br />Within another hour I was wanting my twenty bucks back and ruing the expenditure of a tank of gas, cause straight up, this book isn't as good as I heard it was. Sure I guess a few things might ring true but I suspect these folklore-inspired anecdotally-validated recipes for everything from explosives to pharmaceuticals to ink with which to print anti-establishment posters are shaky in their effectiveness. I don't doubt some of the chapters on violent revolution have bits and pieces of handy tips, like why it's not a good idea to use bicycle chains against riot police and the merits of a soup can over a beer can in fashioning  a makeshift knife, but the more I flipped around this cult classic, the more I began to mumble, \\"Yeah, right!\\"<br /><br />I think it boils down to this. If you find having The Anarchist Cookbook sitting on your dorm room nightstand will make you cooler or score you a date with that leftist poet you've been chasing from Philosophy 101, then buy it.

The four-panel stories of Jeremy, a perpetually fifteen-year-old high school freshman, and his daily misadventures on the rugged uphill climb of adolescence, tell an honest, sometimes rule-bending tale of growing up in modern America.

I was mystified by that. I think maybe in Forever she is less guilty of that than in some of her other books, but I remember finding some examples in here. Without this \\"flaw\\" Forever would rate another star in my review.<br /><br />Forever is well-written. In its story of first love (and, yeah, first sex) it presents its characters realistically and the plot is timeless but clearly connected by certain aforementioned references to the decade in which it takes place. After thirty years it almost comes off as something from the historical genre rather than as Blume clearly intended it.<br /><br />Judy Blume is a First Amendment champion who has bravely opposed censorship on a number of occasions. She delves into topics that would scare off other writers and manages to be \\"up front\\" without being condescending, frank without being lurid. She's a fine writer and knows how to craft a story. She also deserves the criticism with which I began this review: she imposes an expiration date on the cultural overtone of nearly everything she writes. In the case of teenagers whose memories might only stretch back a decade, this is a flaw.<br /><br />Another note. Anyone who reads Forever expecting a salacious account of graphic sex is not going to find it. Exactly why this book has been controversial and banned from school and public libraries defies logic and is simply a shame. Some Americans who don't flinch at violence in books recoil at even modest sexual themes, and that odd discrepancy in our national character is something I've never understood. The decades-long hostile reaction by certain members of our society to the novel Forever is the greatest example of this I can think to cite. This book may reach into campiness in a few scenes but it's not indecent. It's good and it's worth the read for those interested, teen or older.reaction by certain members of our society to the novel Forever is the greatest example of this I can think to cite.

Bush is prolific letter writer, and in All The Best, this public figure allows us a peek into the sometimes very private side of his life in this collection of his personal correspondence. Many of these dispatches date back sixty years, and they paint a picture of the former President that no autobiography quite could.<br /><br />The Bush revealed by his letters is an idealist in his youth, who joins the military out of a strong desire to serve his nation. He tells of his life as a Navy pilot, writes love letters home to the woman he eventually marries, and tells her in one forceful letter from the front of the justice he hopes finds those who carry out combat atrocities in the name of nationalism.<br /><br />Bush later becomes a husband and father (to a first son nicknamed \\"Googie\\") and relocates from New England to the Texas oil country. In one humorous letter from this period, Bush writes local law enforcement apologizing for speeding and asking that in the face of his repentance his fine be repealed. (It wasn't.) Through hundreds of letters that cover most of the twentieth century, we see that George Bush's life is often exciting, though occasionally visited by tragedy, as with the loss of his pre-school-aged daughter Robin. I personally found the writings that covered the domestic and business sides of Mr. Bush's life more interesting than the ones that dealt with his duties as Congressman, UN Ambassador, Head of the CIA, and Republican Party, Ambassador to China, Vice President, and finally President of the United States. The most touching of Bush's writings were the letters he penned to his grandchildren at the times of their births.<br /><br />One of the most inviting aspects of this book is that since it has no linear plotline to follow, it may be perused in random fashion without diminishing its purpose. If one wishes information about the era of the (first) Bush Presidency, that is set off from, say, the chapters that cover Bush's life as a private citizen.<br /><br />The practice of letter writing is either being enhanced by the presence of email, or being undermined by it. However one views the topic, there's little denying that there is an art to authoring a letter, and the forty-first US President is a lifelong master.cover Bush's life as a private citizen. <br /> <br />The practice of letter writing is either being enhanced by the presence of email, or being undermined by it.

Philip K. Dick's usual satiric touch was absent from this gray-toned storyline that reads like something Poe might've written had he been born a century later. Set in a troubled future increasingly matching our realistic expectations, this novella tells the story of the most human-like artificial life forms ever created and of the consequences of crafting \\"machines\\" too much like ourselves. In taking on elements of philosophical musings, Dick clearly intended for us to ponder the same questions Mary Shelley had in mind when she authored Frankenstein two-hundred years ago: namely, at what point does existence become life, and what is it that defines a soul or the absence of a soul? This book is not the movie Blade Runner set in paper form, nor is Blade Runner a diminutive version of this book committed to celluloid. Each stands separately in the arenas of its distinct flaws and virtues, but one does not augment the other. These are two different tales here despite their similarities. A highly Gothic brand of science fiction is what this book presents; its film noir themes radiate with cat and mouse game suspense and more twists than the Blade Runner had. It is also more adept at granting pauses for contemplation than the time limitations ever let Blade Runner offer. The ending is also...unexpectedly unique here in Dick's work. I won't discuss it except to say what I've been saying in here all along: don't expect the same ending shown on film.	2005-09-04

The time is the decade between the mid-1950's and the mid-1960's, and the place is Oates's familiar setting, her native upstate New York. In some ways this never loud but hard-hitting book continues many of the threads common in a multitude of Oates' previous works (a young girl, bookish, intelligent, much like Oates herself was as a teen, from a crumbling home where alcoholism and gambling are the wedge cracking the solidity of daily life; struggling poor family dealt unfair circumstances living in a dying blue collar town; social discord flaring to violence) and yet in many other ways, this is virgin territory for America's greatest living writer.<br /><br />This novel concerns Iris Courtney, a pretty, white, intellectual girl whose future success or failure is basically in her own hands because she cannot count on assistance from either her drunken, once-beautiful mother, or her gullible gambling-addict father. Her one possible ally seems to be an uncle, an affable, secretly-tormented photographer estranged from Iris' father, Duke, secretly in love with Iris' mother, Persia. It also is the story of a black man of roughly Iris' age, named Verlyn Fairchild, who lives in the same town at the same time. On the surface these two would seem to have nothing in common and yet their lives intersect completely by chance one night when Verlyn risks his own life to rescue Iris from a brutal attempted rape at the hands of a thuggish, perhaps retarded teenage bully, feared son of a migratory clan of mountain people who have settled in the factory town. This act of courage creates a bond between two teenagers from different avenues of life, and from that point on, though Iris and Verlyn are seldom in scenes together, the lives of these two characters are continually compared and contrasted, creating a study of the opportunities 1950's life opens--or does not open--depending on little more than the race of the person in question.<br /><br />Iris and Verlyn at the time of their meeting come from roughly the same income levels, from the same broken homes, from the same school system, and were born the same year. But we watch as the tragedy of limited opportunity drags Verlyn into an inescapable existence of poverty, while Iris, through a few lucky breaks and hard work, rises from her beginnings and becomes closely tied to a family of wealthy art collectors called the Savage's. Verlyn's one hope is basketball, a sport at which he excels. His nickname is \\"Iceman\\" referring to his coolness on court when handling the ball. His prowess as a player on the school team momentarily earns him celebrity, high praise, and temporary esteem. But when an on-court accident wrecks Verlyn's future hopes of scholarships and college, it seems every door closes on him, even while Iris's fortunes have turned immeasurably brighter. In the end, Iris becomes engaged to the son of the Savage's and Verlyn takes the only way that is there for him out of his bleak hometown: the US Army during the beginnings of the Vietnam War.  There is a tiny foreshadowing of Verlyn's fate in the military at about the 1/3 point of this novel, long before we learn of his enlistment, and it is there so quickly and at the time so innocuously stated that it might well be missed. Suffice it to say the future resolves itself as expected in the cases of Iris and Verlyn, and there is little justice in it.<br /><br />I'd put this among Oates' top ten novels, which might not sound like a high ranking until one considers just how many novels this prolific woman has published.

After taking some deep, slow breaths to control my rising nausea at the memory of all the affected, egotistical people who went on and on about the message of this book, I went home and delved into Ms. Plath's (always a Ms. when you're dealing with this woman, she's NEVER Mrs. Hughes, no, no, no) take on her own mental collapse during her years as a college student. I looked forward to this like a trip to the dentist, but within 20 pages I was into this story of a brilliantly intelligent, multi-gifted, crazier-than-the-average-loon young woman from the 1950's, who struggled to live up to the high expectations others set for her, imploded into mental illness, and rose again after a course of therapy that included electroshock treatments.<br /><br />I read through the early pages of Plath's humorous and falsely sedate story of her trip to New York after writing a winning essay in a magazine contest, her life and times as a university honors student, and her concealed revulsion at the man she was supposed to marry. Then the imagined  \\"bell jar\\" of the book's title \\"descends\\" to imprison the young Plath, and she spills into madness. Plath ceases to sleep, eat, bathe, or communicate with anyone outside her own bedroom. Her well-meaning but bumblesome mommy tries to chide her seriously deranged daughter back into good behavior but succeeds only in driving Plath into assuming a fetal position in the earth-smelling space under the house. The seriousness of her daughter's state finally sinking into her head, the elder Plath summons help and Sylvia is sent to a progressive mental facility for a harsh but ultimately successful course of treatment.<br /><br />The book takes us through some of the horrors Plath endured in the hospital, and there are numerous cringe-worthy descriptions of exactly what it is like to experience shock treatment. (Ce n'est pas agr&eacute;able!) After Plath emerges from the center in a state of relative sanity and functionality, she returns to her studies and courageously frees herself from her unwanted engagement. Later, with a MOST unfortunate side effect, she loses her virginity to a professor, and thereafter till the book concludes, broods on the deepest fear of her young life, that the \\"bell jar\\" will descend once again. (Which it eventually does, of course, in the next decade, culminating in Plath's suicide.)<br /><br />Incidentally, in my paper, I took the position of her creativity (as it later emerged) partially arising from her suffering, and that Plath the poet of eventual cult status would never have existed had Plath the college student not endured the pains she did. Oops, seems that was not what Dr. Fathead was looking for, so I got a B. Nope, the correct and only answer for an interpretation of this work is that all intelligent women are automatically societal victims and Sylvia was saying that and only that in The Bell Jar. Unfortunately we can't ask Plath what she meant or indeed if there was ANY theme, cause she stuck her head in a gas oven and forfeited the right to speak for herself. So why so many agree with the victim/poor us message Fathead advocated as the ONLY correct impression to take away from this pre-modern classic defies my understanding, but I still liked The Bell Jar a lot more than I was expecting to and hope anyone who reads it gets to do so with the luxury of finding his or her own take on this unsteady tale of mental illness and survival.ly what it is like to experience shock treatment.

Nope, the correct and only answer for an interpretation of this work is that all intelligent women are automatically societal victims and Sylvia was saying that and only that in The Bell Jar. Unfortunately we can't ask Plath what she meant or indeed if there was ANY theme, cause she stuck her head in a gas oven and forfeited the right to speak for herself. So why so many agree with the victim/poor us message Fathead advocated as the ONLY correct impression to take away from this pre-modern classic defies my understanding, but I still liked The Bell Jar a lot more than I was expecting to and hope anyone who reads it gets to do so with the luxury of finding his or her own take on this unsteady tale of mental illness and survival.	2005-09-03

I feel like such an utter sociopathic evil human being for thinking this sick creation is completely hysterical. Oh, gosh, I mean, what's wrong with me that I break out laughing over what sounds in description the most demented thing ever drawn?<br /><br />For those who may not know, The Gashlycrumb Tinies, by the legendary Edward Gorey, is a series of pen and ink illustrations that concern the ghastly, serial deaths of twenty-six small children (yes I feel awful just typing that knowing it's being read) all of whom have a name beginning with one consecutive letter of the alphabet, A,B, C, etc. and all of whom are depicted meeting singularly gruesome fates, each of the incidents set merrily to rhyme.  The children are Victorian or Edwardian, as are nearly all characters Gorey drew, and they meet their demises in astonishingly horrid ways. One is devoured by mice, another is eaten by bears. Another is sucked dry by a leech, yet another unfortunate meets her fate under a rug. One child even manages to perish from ennui!<br /><br />Oh, dear Lord, this is insanity, and yet as penned by Gorey, this is so sick it's funny.<br /><br />I'm stopping here.<br /><br />Before anyone tracks me down to stone me at a crossroads under a full moon while chanting from the Book of Common Prayer, try reading this disgustingly hilarious little collection and see if you don't agree it reaches in and finds some twisted avenue in your soul and tickles till your inner sadist erupts with laughter.<br /><br />I like children.

For its realism it deserves more stars than the three I'm giving it but it was mentally corrosive to the point I can't like what I read. How I finished this at eighteen beats me today. The mid-last-century drug scene was a place of living death and deterioration of the mind, body, and soul. No high, no experience, no act of social rebellion, nothing heroin can give or represent can be worth what  the junky lifestyle takes out of a person and makes the user become. True some genetically cursed with the addictive brain seek out chemical highs like an infant reaching for its mother, but others drift into narcotic addiction because they perceive it as glamorous, and THAT is the terrifying side to Burroughs' story of uttery lost human beings rotting in self-imposed damnation.	2005-09-03

I got the impression throughout this book about the fall of a king among con-men, that nearly all Licht did in his career of non-violent, pseudo-victimless crime was done on his offspring's behalf, not his own. It was disheartening to read about the disintegration of a once-proud, cunning, powerful man whose worldly goods all came from his own intelligence and skill. I think the effects of isolation from those who are loved was the real soul of this book more than the grifting and elaborately staged thefts that lay on the surface. I didn't find as much evil in Abraham as others seemed to. He loved his children, he was devoted to them, he served them in any way that was within his range: in return they were disloyal. As he said of his life of schemes and swindles, those he conned were willing partners in their own downfalls. \\"Complicity?

He tells an intelligent story of how the southern states might have come out victors in 1863, gaining independence and avoiding what would have been the final, bloodiest two years of the American Civil War.<br /><br />Kantor tell of how the losses of Sherman and Grant, along with other developments (that in some cases very nearly happened) changed history and ended the war in favor of the south. He goes on to trace the history of the American nations over the next century, from the Davis, Lee, Jackson and Stuart administrations in Confederate-controlled Washington DC, thru the building of the new US capital, Columbia, in present-day Columbus, Ohio. Kantor tells of Texas' withdrawal from the Confederacy and its annexation of the Indian territory to its north. He introduces us to popular figures, like multi-term Virginia Senator Robert E. Lee Stuart, son of JEB, an extraordinary man who never existed in our own timeline. Kantor creates a believable example of the way it could have been and does a handy job of making all this interesting.

I'll tell you why.<br /><br />I wish certain categories of writers would evolve past the chips on their shoulders. By this I speak of many (not all) feminist writers (like Stone), ethnic minority writers, and gay writers, who frequently set out not so much to speak objectively, but to bash another gender/race/sexual group with their project. Can't these offenders move beyond personal bitterness and be confident in their self-respect so that they don't feel the burden to aggress in their undertakings? They would bolster their credibility tremendously if they could achieve this state of professional neutrality and quit trying to change humanity.<br /><br />Where I started off enthralled at the idea expostulated by this book, I wound up disgruntled at the limitations author Stone imposed on it. While she was thorough in citing archaeological evidence to support her supposition that women were once the earthly power brokers in human communion with the spiritual world before displacement under male-dominant systems during the agrarian revolution, never did she quite let go of the self-limiting need to vicariously \\"get even\\" for the conjectured crime of women being robbed of a (she believes rightful) place as head of human religious-spiritual practices. One moment I would be deep into excellently-written descriptions of dig-sites in the Near East, the next I'd be forced into yet another tiresome diatribe on Stone's grievances of choice.<br /><br />What I wish is that this book had contained less of Ms. Stone in it and more of a straightforward story of the time when female spirituality was dominant. Had this been the case, she could have then taken us forward more completely to how, when, why the transformation to patriarchal religions came about. I think this transition, should have been the real backbone of this subject instead of the scant sideshow it is. True she does offer some lip service at book's end to the idea that gender equality is superior to sexism, but rightly or wrongly that-honestly-struck me as a concession the publishers forced into this book to make it seem less radical and agenda-ridden. Had this been a fictional story, then the writer would have been free to lobby her ideals via any story she might have chosen to create (a la Marion Zimmer Bradley's Avalon series) but to claim to write history and then underlie it with contemporary sociological messages...that's not how good history is written. Furthermore, it wears thin when a writer who is a member of a group/race/gender acts as if she speaks for the entirety of that entity. She does not speak for me nor I suspect does she speak for most women. Merlin Stone is doing service to neither history nor living women by radicalizing this subject and polarizing her readers.<br /><br />I still believe the history of religion and a study of its roots in matriarchal cultures is a worthy one and it awaits someone more unbiased to deliver it to the world.to the idea that gender equality is superior to sexism, but rightly or wrongly that-honestly-struck me as a concession the publishers forced into this book to make it seem less radical and agenda-ridden.

I also failed to see why the whole \\"sacred feminine\\" religion was necessarily any better than Christianity, and in its holy orgies and etc. in some ways seemed undignified.

Yes, there's a statement here about free will and the price society must pay for its preservation, but I believe the funny parts were not meant to escape as many readers as they do. There were times when I was reading this story of a violent teenager (much younger than he was in the film version) where I laughed till my sides ached. I know devotees will see that as sacrilege, but it's also just plain true and if you miss the laughs in here, you're missing the best part.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange is about Alex DeLarge, his teenaged gang of \\"droogs\\" and their sordid misadventures in England a generation or two hence. Alex and his cohorts dress like characters straight out of a comic book, talk to one another in Slavic-flavored \\"nadsat speak\\" an invented, brutal dialect, and imbibe psychotropic-laced milk before proceeding on nightly raids into their dilapidated city. In among the descriptions of turf wars, assaults, robberies, vandalism, rape, and eventually cold-blooded murder, Alex tells us of his keen love of classical music, which he appreciates to...er, \\"auto-erotic\\" heights. Alex is intelligent, driven, shows strong leadership skills, and one gets the sense that in another age or slightly different background he might have made something of promising young Tory spouting \\"Britannia Forever!\\" while wrapping himself in the Union Jack. But not in his rusting era of post-Imperial decomposition.<br /><br />Eventually Alex's crime spree goes too far and he is sent to prison for slaying a woman in her home. In the overcrowded prison, Alex survives and in a manner even thrives, and in the course of serving his time, he is befriended by an earnestly good man, the hard-drinking, true believing chaplain, whom Alex uses to his advantage. It is during this period that Alex learns of a psychological treatment being proposed as a means of solving Britain's horrific crime problems. It involves a sort of brainwashing whereby the recipient can no longer of his own free will choose to undertake an act of violence upon any other living creature. Alex volunteers to be the first to undergo this course of experimentation, and is rendered harmless but somewhat pathetically neutered in his capacity or act on his own volition. It is the consequences of this treatment and the effects it has on Alex's life that provides the final portion of this brilliantly inventive piece of fiction.<br /><br />This is a novel divided into three sections of seven chapters each, highlighting author Burgess' fondness for numerology. Until recently, most readers in the United States read a version that conformed more to the legendary Stanley Kubrick film that ended with Alex \\"cured\\" and once more set free on society. The novel as originally written and now restored goes one step further and projects several years into Alex's future, wherein he outgrows violence and consciously elects to become a law-abiding citizen, an exercise in free will accomplishing what the harsh chemical treatments during his incarceration could not.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange is a worthy book that rewards with humor and thoughtful prose.er of his own free will choose to undertake an act of violence upon any other living creature.

She describes the time and place of the gang's formation and reveals who the others in the group with her were. She then tells secrets.<br /><br />At first the activities of Foxfire, the name of a club and later a gang, begin almost innocently but its deeds become more and more serious. The narrator reveals how this group of teenaged girls from the wrong side of the tracks in a down on its heels Great Lakes factory town became involved in \\"hooking\\" vulnerable, sexually-perverse men and playing on their fears of public exposure to exploit them for money. She informs us of Foxfire's involvement in lodging violence against those branded public enemies, and tells of the gang's Robin Hood like deeds of good will on behalf of the poor and out of luck. She also tells how things begin to go wrong even as the ambitions of Legs, the streetwise leader of the girls, plots the kidnapping of a millionaire industrialist.<br /><br />Oates produced Foxfire in a five-year stretch of particularly dark novels that included Zombie, and Black Water. By the mid-nineties she wrote one of her most publicly well-received works, We Were The Mulvaney's, and seemed for a time to emerge into a lighter vein of fiction, but for this novel at least, Oates' pessimistic theme of society diminishing the spirit of those who do not conform to it rings loud and clear.	2005-09-02

The vividly literate John Fowles is a fine writer but what ON earth was this book about? I read an interview where he commented that one day he would like to create \\"a maze constructed of literature\\" and perhaps that's the explanation for A Maggot, a novel that seems to begin as a straightforward, near-perfectly written tale set in the eighteenth century (roughly halfway between the Glorious and French Revolutions) but eventually becomes a science fiction-ish brain tease that doesn't exactly make much sense.<br /><br />I THINK this was the story of a young 18th century Lord, a man steeped in occult and arcane lore, who, while mysteriously journeying on the muddy roads of western England with a few of his retainers and a hired prostitute, was taken into the distant, utopian future by a time traveler, and the Lord's father has hired a strong-arm investigator to learn what happened to his rebellious son, but..I'm not sure. This book was THAT nebulous. At first it begins well with its precise descriptions of a traveler's life in the 1730's, but it branches off into asides about civil disturbances in the north of Britain, and then shifts into...whatever it becomes. At the end Shakerism, hardly a world-changing religion, is foretold in an unenlightening aside, and there seems some hint that perhaps either the missing Lord or a man from the distant, peaceful future of earth, fathered, 'Mother Ann,' the founder of that now extinct cult.<br /><br />Fowles' books always make intellectual demands on the reader, but I fear he may have left too much out in this case for us to piece together what he means.<br /><br />Read this book, named after an archaic colloquialism for a riddle or puzzle, if you're an ardent admirer of John Fowles, if you like to visit recreations of the eighteenth-century, or if you think anything I've said in this review sounds welcoming, but be advised that this is an incompletely explained story that is frustrating and not wholeheartedly worth the time, sad to say.	2005-09-01

I'm going to skip jotting what this story was about and offer my opinion. Fair enough?<br /><br />Back when this was cruising the top spot on the Times best seller lists I used to hear a lot of jokes made about this book. Mostly these were told by men, men who probably never read this or any other \\"chick book\\" in their lives, so I didn't pay much attention to them. I never let anyone's bad opinion of a book stop me from reading what I want, but I didn't have a lot of interest in TBOMC or get around to it till long after the buzz about this novella (let's not call it a novel, it's not) had subsided. I'd seen the movie version, thought it was decent, and came to this book with a neutral outlook.<br /><br />Now here's my take:<br /><br />This isn't a terrible novel but I'm surprised it got enough word of mouth exposure to make it the record-breaker it was. I think it wasn't the writing that made it well-received, so much as how it touched on the fantasy of so many bored, trapped middle-aged women who would have loved to have had a dashing stranger come into their lives, fall in love with them overnight, and offer them the chance for \\"escape\\". I didn't find Mr. Waller a capable writer, I didn't regard the characters as convincingly cast, I didn't even care what became of any of them. This book was too brief to be boring but it wasn't exciting, either.<br /><br />You know, though, life's short and full of misery, so if this brightened anyone's life ten years ago or does so ten years from now, that's all that should matter about The Bridges of Madison County.	2005-09-01

I won't do titles in this review but there was one poem in particular about a young girl who lived a dangerous life with her risky sexual behavior, and it seemed to rise above the others in \\"Night\\" because it was stark, sanguine and harder-hitting than most of Jewel's mildly esoteric themes.<br /><br />That poem generated the thought that there but for the grace of God/fate/karma/luck go so many of us.<br /><br />What is most obvious to a discerning reader is that these are less the poetical works of a musical star and more the personal writings of a sincere, very young, still almost innocent human being who skipped pretension and bravely shared something meaningful. Because of that as much as because of the actual content of the poems, these worth reading.	2005-09-01

But...I don't see what the big deal is. My suspicion is, as I hinted above in my jerky little title, people hail this book because they think it makes them somehow elite and cool to proclaim a kinship to it. I think that's the key to the \\"popularity\\" of a lot of art, a lot of music, a lot of literature extolled by subcultures within the masses. They are bolstered by an illusion of affinity for what they secretly do not embrace. In the case of this book, at times Kerouac's prose was lovely and at other times it rambled  until I had no idea what he was going on about. The concept of The Dharma Bums is exciting and if even a fraction of those who claim this novel awakened something spiritual inside them are being honest, then I respect its impact on them, but...I didn't connect with the Beat vocabulary, with the story here, or the fact that since it's probably as much invention as autobiography, it validly inspires aspirations of real life imitation. But then again (as I'm sure so many reading this will gleefully agree) what do I know?	2005-09-01

Well, most of those books have had their proverbial fifteen minutes and gone back to the reserve shelves, but out of all of the sources of information I read then about life one-thousand years ago, this one is the best and has endured the longest in popularity.<br /><br />The Year 1000: What Life Was Like at the Turn of the First Millennium condenses what could have been a lengthy, dull read into an erudite crash course in daily life in England circa 1000 CE. I have high praise for this work of scholarly research, and haven't come across any other book that tells so much interesting history in so short a space.<br /><br />The authors also did a service to \\"Medieval\\" people by making them  something other than drooling bumpkins. In here we are told that, amazingly, the physical height of an eleventh-century Englishman exceeded that of his industrial age descendants, and was about on par with that of someone from the century just completed. Tooth decay was almost unknown due to a diet low in sugars, and people were typically in better shape and constitutionally more vigorous than we sedentary twenty-first century individuals.<br /><br />Humans living in England a millennium ago were a hardy lot who faced challenges and struggles that would have more than daunted modern men and women, and yet through intelligence and ingenuity, they prospered. Life expectancy was on the increase during the eleventh century, and so, gradually, was technological progress. Theirs was a world of unpolluted skies and dense forests that spread their natural beauty from one shore of Britain to the next. Unknown were toxic waste dumps, acid rain, urban sprawl and possible nuclear annihilation. If they had their plagues then, so do we today in the age of AIDS. If Vikings could appear on their beaches to wage destruction, the comparably modern people live in the dark shadow of bio-chemical terrorism.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, this was also a time of aforementioned barbarian invasions, of superstition, near universal illiteracy, fascist-like control by the dominant religious institution, and nearly everyone dwelled in cruelest poverty, dependant on the eclectic fortunes of good harvest for their basic survival. Bathing was not a commonplace practice during this era, death in childbirth frighteningly mundane, medicine a hodgepodge mixture of surviving Hellenistic cures and folksy home remedies, and two children in five failed to see their tenth birthdays.<br /><br />No denying, in most ways we have it better today.<br /><br />This book describes all avenues of daily life, and even passes along some genuinely funny jokes and clever riddles contemporary to this period. The rhythms of the seasons and the distinctive characteristics of the months of the calendar year are featured, as are a few of the dominant figures who influenced England in that era. The authors impart such curious tidbits as the fact beer was universally drunk by child and adult alike, for its intoxicating effects as well as for its perceived nutritional properties. We are informed that salt and honey, hardly luxuries in our time, were so valued then they were even drafted as a means of currency. And end to end in this worthy book, the Medieval mindset is thoroughly probed as those living then struggled to fill in the gaps of their knowledge, sometimes creatively, frequently with concepts shocking to modern sensibilities.

I'll just say here: I wonder if there's ever been a novel in history that has made more people cry? Seriously! I remember finshing this book in fourth grade, lying on my bed and sobbing my heart out into my pillow so no one would hear. Even the consolation that some of Charlotte's daughters would be there year after year for Wilbur wasn't much help. I loved this book and spent a while wishing I was Fern living there on the farm, but boy is it the uncontested tearjerker of ALL time!	2005-08-30

This eighty-year-old cookbook full of hundred-plus-hundred-year-old dishes is a regional secret and a favorite for fans of the Mason-Dixon Line sort of southern cooking found pretty much only in a place like Kentucky. I have one of the rare first editions of this classic that my grandmother acquired on a trip to Louisville during a Derby week in the 1950's. It's the sort of book I wouldn't sell for almost any price. I really love the idea of the dishes in here, and like to think back on the era when cooks actually had the abilityto make these sorts meals with their all-day preparation times. This is a low-fat fan's worst nightmare with its meat and gravy heavy, fried food loving tone, but you know, its author lived well into her nineties and ate like this every day, so today's modern nutritionists really don't know as much as they like to lead on. Out of Kentucky Kitchens is full of charm and vanished Commonwealth graces. It augments any pantry bookshelf, whether for a serious cook or casual fan like me.	2005-08-30

Usually Oates is dead-on in her re-workings of fact but in Blonde, she misses the mark. I know some people who read this long, stumbling book and liked it, but they were major fans of Monroe. Personally I found the story uninteresting, the message of tragedy and blame unworthy of the intricate genius of Oates, and the Marilyn of the novel less exploited and pre-programmed to failure, as Oates wished her to seem, and more of an annoying fool too hamstrung by her own inability to learn from mistakes to successfully manage her own ambitions. Joyce Carol Oates is still one of the greatest writers in American letters, but in Blonde she fails to deliver a work that meets her own lofty hopes for the ideas out of which it grew.	2005-08-30

At first understandably terrified and puzzled that she is being called \\"Clare\\" by denizens of a previous age who seem to know her, she soon pieces together the fact that she has switched places with a girl who is now living in Charlotte's own time, the 1960's. Charlotte and Clare ingeniously manage to communicate with one another via a diary hidden on the school grounds, and Emily, Clare's sister becomes the one confidant of Charlotte in a past that is foreign and frightening to her modern mind. Britain during this time is at war and terrible air raids are going on near the boarding school. There is death and sadness here told more darkly than in most mid-century novels intended for teenage girls, and it jumps to mind why Clare is so willing to return from the relative safety and prosperity of the future. I suppose the obvious answer is the love of family and familiarity outweigh lesser material things.<br /><br />Charlotte worries she will be stuck in the past, and exactly why she is there and how she might ever return home are carefully guarded secrets, revealed only at the opportune time, near the very ending: an ending which is very sad and involves the death of one of the two girls, a death that though of natural causes, harkens back to the fact it might not have occurred had the sacrifice that ends this book not been chosen. At this final point the main character poignantly becomes Emily, who waited thru half the twentieth century to see Charlotte again in the future, and discuss with her the events of the past they knew together.<br /><br />This story was the basis for the Cure song of the same name, with its dense, atmospheric video telling the story of two teenaged girls stuck in the same school in different eras. I admit I had no idea of the novel's existence during the time I loved the Cure song so much I named my dog \\"Charlotte Sometimes\\" in tribute, but wish I had. I think this novel may have gone out of print for a time, especially on the American side of the Atlantic, because I don't remember hearing about it until just a few years ago.

It's not a complicated read, which is actually something of a rarity among politician reminiscences. Now I think I'll pass it on to my dad and raise his blood pressure a little.<br /><br />U2's Bono, campaigning at the time for amnesty for Third World debt, was on record as saying he genuinely liked Jesse Helms, then head of the Foreign Relations Committee, a fact that stunned me since I cannot imagine two more unlikely bedfellows. I thought if a leftist icon like Bono could have something good to say about a Senator so far to the right he makes most conservatives look moderate, then maybe he is worth a second consideration. And really, Helms was worthy of one. I admit I now think he is slightly funny, always candid, more \\"down home\\" than polished, and I no longer revile him with quite the same unfettered passion I did in the Clinton years during the William Weld nomination, when I lived in New England and Helms was public enemy number one up there.<br /><br />Conservatives are sure to like this admittedly plain-spoken, honest memoir by one of America's most reviled Senators, but for most Americans, especially those left of center or in possession of a conscience centered around secular morality, this is going to be seen as a case of a man having been given enough rope to hang himself. \\"Senator No\\" who voted against the creation of a day honoring Martin Luther King, who unfalteringly challenged appointments of those candidates for office who did not agree with his own views, who explained he opposed the Civil Rights Act because southern society would have eventually corrected its own segregation issues without the Federal Government's intervention, is forthright in his explanations for his conduct. He makes the claim that Martin Luther King's unreleased FBI files show he was in fact a Marxist sympathizer during the Cold War, and Helms counters the growing iconic stature of that civil rights leader, by saying the US public deserves to know the whole truth behind this nearly-universally lauded individual. A valid point.<br /><br />Helms also gives his views in this book on the US Presidents who were in office during his thirty-plus years in the Senate. He is strong in his praise of Ronald Reagan, generous toward both Presidents Bush, the latter of whom must surely rate as something of a political soul mate, and had less rancor toward President Clinton than I would have expected.  Alas Helms does also write endlessly and monotonously on the subject of abortion, which he likens to the Jewish Holocaust, and challenges the rights of homosexuals (a group Helms more than opposes...he somehow seems to fear...) to any legal recognition whatsoever.<br /><br />Helms stood outside the views of the US majority on most of the issues which he championed, and never won any of his re-election bids even in ultra-conservative North Carolina, by more than a slim majority. Still, this man does take a forthright stand on those matters he believes in, and despite being the target of so much ridicule and disapprobation by those in opposition to him, no scandal ever arose during all his years in office to lend weight to claims that he was personally dishonest or hypocritical in the fundamentalist Christian morality on which he based his campaigns.<br /><br />I guess the bottom line on this memoir is this venerable Republican has earned the right to speak his mind in this his retired life, and he does it with more candor and vigor than most career politicians would have dared.he growing iconic stature of that civil rights leader, by saying the US public deserves to know the whole truth behind this nearly-universally lauded individual.

(For instance, \\"1979\\" one of the finest songs of the 90's, what do those words truly mean if you analyze them?) That's most of the problem here. I kept thinking how set to music much of Corgan's free verse would have taken wing, but on its own...it was lacking: even empty. There are some good pieces here in Blinking with Fists but I hope Billy concentrates more on music in the future, since that's where his talent--genius I'll go so far as to say--really lies.

It is impossible to open this slender volume and not have that foremost in mind. Even the opening pages here are hand-written in the Cardinal's beautiful penmanship. This man, once seriously considered American's one great hope for the Papacy, lived a life in so many ways worthy of imitation. The late Cardinal was imperfect, needless to say, and his personal epistemological beliefs were not shared by all Americans, but in the good things that may be known of him, he was inspiring in a highly positive way. He personified modesty, dignity, grace, and exercised almost super-human powers of personal forgiveness as demonstrated in his laying aside all enmity toward the troubled young man who falsely accused him of molestation. Bernardin was a man who committed the first hour of every day of his life to prayerful meditation, and in a reversal of the past dogmatic intolerance of Catholicism, advocated the ecumenical consanguinity of all humans regardless of race, religion or creed. When visiting a Chicago-area synagogue during his time as Cardinal, Bernardin greeted the Jewish worshipers there by telling them, \\"I am Joseph, your brother.\\"<br /><br />This book tells in his own words Bernardin's battle with the cancer that ultimately killed him. He was a man who did not shun death, he embraced it as part of life, and--in his view-the doorway to a better existence. It also tells of how his faith sustained him in his darkest hour (far more dire, he confesses, than the terminal cancer) which came in the months that followed the unfounded accusations of pederasty made against him by a one-time seminarian.<br /><br />Bernardin, through this last book, founds a legacy of moral goodness that should stand as a challenge not just to Roman Catholics but to humanity everywhere, to lay aside anger, pessimism and violence, and strive toward a life in which hope, peace, selflessness, form the foundation. In this post-911 world, we probably need more than ever to remember that there are, were, and will be good people in human society who set examples for all of us.

When things built up and I needed to escape the pressures of school and life, I'd melt into this friendly little novel about the recent past and some likable people who lived there. I identified with Charlotte Flax (and a little with Mrs. Flax, too). Charlotte and I were both teenagers who read a lot about the lives of the saints (me in school, Charlotte, who is Jewish, of her own volition) we both loved to drive, even though we weren't old enough to have licenses yet, and we both had young, beautiful mothers who frequently drove us crazy.<br /><br />The whole concept of this novel was beyond cool, too, to my teenaged mind. It was a glorious fantasy. Moving to a brand new place, the beautiful coast of New England, fresh start, being boy crazy and meeting the most awesome man of your dreams practically next door to you, finding out who you are... It was great.<br /><br />In Mermaids, the Flax family, colorful, saint-obsessed Charlotte, fourteen, Kate, nine, who plans to swim the English Channel, and their mother, the smoking-hot, flighty Rachael (who had Charlotte when she was about sixteen) settle into the tiny Massachusetts town of Grove, in the summer of 1963. Mrs. Flax, as Charlotte calls her mother, has lived by any standards an interesting life, and has relocated her daughters eighteen times in the past fourteen years. Charlotte's reaction to this constant mobility has been to retreat into a semi-fantasy world of Catholic saints. In fact Charlotte, unlike me at that age (who lived in sheer horror of the thought) plans on being a nun, despite the fact she's Jewish. As Charlotte and her family settle into Grove, the book introduces a nice cast of characters, like Lou Lanksy, the good-natured shoe salesman who quickly gets a major crush on Mrs. Flax; the Mother Superior of the local convent, who develops a friendship with Charlotte and confides some very surprising things to her; and above all others, Joey, the young caretaker of the nearby nunnery, for whom Charlotte falls head over heels into obsessive, crushy--but to her very real--love.<br /><br />This book tells the story of a goofy, remarkable, sometimes sad fourteen-year-old and the year in which her life (and against the backdrop of the Kennedy assassination the nation itself) changes dramatically. This is a story about love, about growing up, about facing fears and about gaining confidence. It's a lovely, happy, quirky, funny chick-flick of a tale that somehow caught a spark in me back in the day. I'll always treasure Mermaids and hope others do too.the young caretaker of the nearby nunnery, for whom Charlotte falls head over heels into obsessive, crushy--but to her very real--love. <br /> <br />This book tells the story of a goofy, remarkable, sometimes sad fourteen-year-old and the year in which her life (and against the backdrop of the Kennedy assassination the nation itself) changes dramatically.

Although this is not exactly the dead-on same story as the movie of like name, anyone whose seen and loved Trainspotting on screen will be glad to find Renton, Sickboy, Spuds, the sociopathic Francis Begby, clean-living Tommy (and Lizzie!) and all the rest of the gang here in the novel that inspired one of the freshest, grossest and funniest movies of the mid-1990's.<br /><br />For those who do not know, Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting is set in Scotland in roughly contemporary times, and tells the tale of Mark Renton, a twenty-ish philosophical junky and his band of mates, as they run, walk and crawl through a sometimes dismal, sometimes upbeat life in a post-industrial, pre-future society. Among their adventurous efforts to keep themselves in heroin (supplied by a colorful man called Mother Superior--on account of the length of his habit) Renton and the others joyfully rob American tourists, steal TV's from old age homes, and generally push onward through an existence that holds no promise of a tomorrow. Along the way, some extremely strange events come to pass. Renton unexpectedly finds himself with a thoroughly jailbait girlfriend who is roughly thirteen going on thirty; Begby goes on the lam after a violent crime goes bad; and as he passes thru a vicious episode of the DT's, Renton looks on aghast with horror as a dead baby slinks in accusatory fashion over the ceiling above his head.<br /><br />In case you can't guess, this is one strange novel.<br /><br />Trainspotting is worth the effort of dissecting the meaning of the odd, Celtic-flavored words Welsh uses to tell this tale of a crew of heroin-using Scotsmen in a pessimistic society that has seen better days.

In truth they were fraught with perils, economic and social, and under the surface of post-war calm, the decade boiled with tensions that underlay the fears of the American psyche. In these pages, behind the tale of an incestuous love story of a teenaged niece and her half-uncle, a boxer who might merit a title shot, is the Red Scare, the fear of the bomb, the social intolerance of McCarthyism, and the terror of the consequences of straying from the norms the American culture had set.<br /><br />My favorite scene in this book, and also its most frustrating, is when the father of the family at the heart of this energetic, moody novel, is taken into custody and ruthlessly interrogated by governmental agents, after he is reported for possible \\"Red sympathies\\". The cause of this detention? The man had opened an atlas at his store to show an ignorant, argumentative \\"true blue red-blooded patriotic American\\" that China, against which the US was at war in Korea at that time, was geographically larger than the United States.<br /><br />In the '50's, that could be all it took to ruin someone's life.<br /><br />You Must Remember This IS also the tale of a secret sexual affair between a teenage girl and her own father's half-brother. It begins with one of the most compelling and addicting ten pages in literature, as the girl undertakes a suicide attempt in her family's presence, in the dead of night. This action funnels any worthy reader in for at least the next hundred pages, at which point it becomes too late to turn back: Oates has already woven her spell.<br /><br />You Must Remember This does not set out to be all things to all readers, but in its tale of tragic love, political intimidation and nuclear fears infiltrating the country's subconscious, it is very nearly that.	2005-08-28

Yep, that's about the only claim to fame of this shallow, eye-batting bit of fluff and nonsense. Needed some sex to spice it up and maybe a few curse words or a little war, courtesy of Napoleon across the Channel. Sex 'n violence, that's the key. I mean couldn't Emma have been ravished a little by one of the courtly fops who paid a call and couldn't she have gouged an eye out with a hairpin or red-hot poker in defense of her virtue? Helllooo,  action and excitement, like Clarissa had a century earlier with Richardson? He knew a thing or two about keeping a bored middle school honors English class going. Yep. It would've helped. I've held a grudge against this insipid it's-somehow-great-because-it's-old bubble-headed tripe since it was forced on me like a bad blind date in the 8th grade. I hated this book. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of lower is that it did have a few redeeming moments and plus anything from another age that gives us a small peek into the lifestyles of the past (even a shallow and vain group of peasant-exploiting petty aristocratic-wanna-bes from the past) is worth something. Oh, plus there was the whole Clueless spin-off thing. Yeah, Clueless was so huge to us in the mid-90's we even used to go, \\"WWAD?\\" (What Would Alicia Do?) So I can't let myself utterly excoriate this headache-inducing, bulimia-inspiring, plot-thin-as-supermodel-tale from the dim brain of Miss Austen, a woman deeply in need of a good love affair. (If you catch what I'm saying.)<br /><br />It mystifies me they managed to make a passable film version out of Emma ten years ago during the Austen craze in Hollywood. If only the book had been that tolerable.<br /><br />All right, Austen fans, slam my review if you want, but all you readers-for-fun out there, those of you I might have saved from a long boring nothing-happens kinda novel: YOU'RE WELCOME!!!!	2005-08-28

For several post-read weeks when I was fifteen, I had dreams about this book, it crossed my mind dozens of times per day, and I got to having strange, probably misplaced, concerns that something like Miranda's fate was going to be my own. Quaint fears in retrospect but important to me at the time.<br /><br />The Collector by John Fowles, is the story of Miranda, an idealistic, beautiful young student of twenty, and Frederick, the \\"Collector\\" who abducts her and holds her captive in a well-furnished cellar of an old country house. Frederick has long had a fascination for butterflies--more specifically with capturing and mounting them for display--and to his mind, Miranda is one more lovely and prized specimen to possess and enjoy. He seems to be a man of virtually no conscience, though he has fits of generosity and truly appears to be in love with Miranda. Frederick has long been obsessively captivated by Miranda, whom he observes as she attends art classes and associates with friends across the street from where Frederick works. For many months, it remains simply this: an inconsequential attraction on the part of a lonely, slightly warped young man for a beautiful girl who scarcely knows he exists.<br /><br />And then...a change.<br /><br />Frederick wins a small fortune in a sort of lottery, and is able to quit his job and, in the excess of time this leaves him, formulate a simple, yet cunning plan to kidnap Miranda and bring her into his life, the greatest and loveliest capture for his collection. He buys the old house I mentioned above, constructs a prison in a hidden subterranean cellar (once a hideout of renegade priests during times of anti-Catholic persecution) and decks this room out with every manner of luxury he can imagine Miranda might ever want. He assures us (and himself) he will grant her every courtesy and never harm her in any way, and yet he also has no intentions of ever permitting her freedom. He then concocts the manner in which he shall obtain his human butterfly, and sets off to make it happen...<br /><br />I can say without fear that all this is mild foreshadowing of what occurs in this intense yet rapidly-paced, easily-flowing novel. Fowles resolves matters quickly so he can observe for himself what comes next. What he treats us to is the interplay between two human beings in what could easily become a claustrophobic setting. This is a novel about interaction, about reaction, about inaction and about how normal the abnormal can be made to seem.  It's a great work by a man whose career saw many great works, and it is quite possibly the best first novel in the last fifty years. I re-read The Collector at least every year or two and as I mentioned in my title up there, I always find something new in the plot or dialogue I'd missed all the other times, that adds a theretofore unknown dimension to Fowles' classic.ry he can imagine Miranda might ever want.

What these two books (collected in one volume) are is an invaluable resource that takes a reader on a village-by-village, region-by-region tour of 12th century Wales. Gerald, a Benedictine monk in royal service, had a scholarly eye and a novelist's touch in describing what he encountered on his trips thru the westernmost nation on the island of Britain. Gerald tells of a Wales still independent from England, still Celtic and very much a fiercely independent state in its own right. He describes the hair styles, clothing, dining preferences, architecture, religious and historical sites (including a legend of the burial place of one King Arthur) and does it in a way that never loses the spark of immediacy, even for those of us centuries in Gerald's future. This book reads a lot like a piece from National Geographic, only it's nine-hundred years old! Without Gerald, we never would get to meet so many interesting human beings who once lived out lives in a time and place far removed from where we dwell today. This descriptive memoir is an improbable survivor, and a treasure in the collective library of the human race.	2005-08-28

If so, that might explain a lot, since this hefty novel (that begins with so much energy and promise amid its descriptions of the minutia of Victoria life) ends in the literary equivalent of mid-air, and leaves a heck of a lot unanswered. In fact, it has no ending, per se, it simply...ends.<br /><br />The Crimson Petal And The White, is the story of Sugar, a singularly gifted, if slightly less than lovely, nineteen-year-old prostitute in 1870's London, who spends hours penning exceedingly graphic pornographical tales of herself exacting vengeance on the men of her world. She, whose life has been a string of betrayals and hardships, imagines herself gassing men, mutilating men, and poisoning them. The Crimson Petal and the White is also the story of William Rackham, a bored, underachieving heir to a cosmetic empire begun by his father. Rackham has a young daughter he ignores, a father from whom he is utterly estranged, and an insane child-bride of a wife who dwells in a fantasy world of devils and angels and virgin-saints, the last of whom she thinks visit her on a regular basis. William Rackham encounters Sugar one night after hearing of her thru a source of gossip on the London sexual underground and eventually takes her on as first his mistress, and then, in a move that surpasses all improbability, as the governess of his unloved and unwanted daughter.<br /><br />In the background of all this is a clutter of secondary characters, sub-plots (that typically go nowhere and are never resolved) and a few genuinely interesting multi-sensory descriptions of what life was like at all levels of London society a hundred and thirty years ago. At times Faber's prose is truly excellent and I was glad I accepted his invitation at the start of the book to follow along on this tale. Yet by mid-novel I was despairing that things were ever going to start moving forward, and in the last pages I was wondering how the resolution to so many unanswered questions was going to fit in such a small space. When I reached the \\"end\\" of this vast, echoing novel, I was puzzled and angry. If Faber intended to be so rude as to leave us as lost and ignorant about the fates of the individuals about whom we'd been reading for 900 pages, why did he bother to author such an exercise in sheer frustration? This is not a story as much as it is a long descriptive slink along the cobblestones and in the alleyways and bedchambers of gritty, industrial England.<br /><br />All that said, this heralded novel of sex was not nearly so pornographic as it was clinical. It was not sensual in any way and was frequently cold and harsh. There was no love for anyone by anyone anywhere within it. This is a novel about selfishness and opportunism, written by a man who practiced it in real life by setting us all up for the fall that accompanied reading such a long novel that doesn't deliver on any one of its promises. If it had, or if things had been re-worked so they were just a little bit different, this might have been one of the great modern novels of Victorian times.g how the resolution to so many unanswered questions was going to fit in such a small space.

There is little to fear here and less still to insult Christian devotion. Most of all there is scant danger of a potential convert or professed Christian being led astray into doubt or secular humanism. Since it is made abundantly clear to all who open the cover of The Last Temptation of Christ, that this is not a religious document, there is faint concern that any unaffiliated soul unlearned in Biblical lore might be swayed against Christianity. This is a fictional tale and it claims to be nothing else. Its author had no designs on founding a new branch of Christianity, and made no claims on being a prophet. He was a writer, and a writer solely. And he was a very fine one at that.<br /><br />This book makes use of most of the central characters from the Four Gospels, and treats the known biography of Jesus as a background upon which to draw. Writing versions of the lives of historical men and women is as old as drama itself; Shakespeare was carrying on a long tradition of this, and so was Nikos Kazantzakis. The question to be asked then is this one: Is Jesus too sacred a person for any writer to be allowed leave to dramatize the happenings in his life? If the answer is yes, then perhaps The Last Temptation of Christ deserves some of the scathing denunciations that have existed against it for seventy years. If, however the answer to the question is no, then doesn't this book merit tolerance and an approach from a position of open-mindedness?<br /><br />The character of Jesus here is more flesh and blood human being than in perhaps any other in literary source where we meet him (especially more so than in Norman Mailer's hideous 1990's take on the Gospel). Jesus is puzzled by who he is. He seeks answers for the confusing state of his mind and soul. He pieces together the meaning God has for him and the role he is to play in the plan for the salvation of humanity. Yet rather than the simplistic march to sacrifice too many assign to Jesus (despite Biblical accounts of his agony in the garden) Jesus in this novel cannot help but wish for the chance at a normal, happy life that should be his and anyone's to pursue. The \\"last temptation\\" of the title comes from the offer the devil makes Jesus, not precisely of riches and power, but the chance to be a simple husband and father and live a long life among his family, contended and secure in the outcomes his, rather than God's, actions have created. And still, this true child of God denies himself all he might have had, and commits himself by his death to the redemption of the peoples of the earth, past and future.<br /><br />This novel is beautifully written and Kazantzakis artfully sculpts a world still mostly given to the raw, primitive days of human history. There is blood here, there are slaughtered animals, and feasts, and fights and journeys through deserts that leave the participants footsore. There is food in endless variety described by the author, a Greek of the early twentieth-century, who obviously knew the worth of plenty in a world where many starved. This is a great work of literature and I value it highly. I don't agree with any significant criticism for it that I have encountered. It does not diminish Jesus, it elevates him by making him more recognizable to his fellow human beings. The Last Temptation readily deserves the five stars I have awarded it.ers for the confusing state of his mind and soul.

It is both a perfect example of a novel of the Victorian era, and also the product of a twentieth-century narrator, who openly inserts himself into key moments of the story in order to reveal details and compare and contrast the age of his characters with that of his own time 100 years in their future. This unnamed narrator, almost certainly Fowles, himself, is all-knowing and never unaware of the fates and ultimate decisions of those he describes in this novel. He is in fact God-like in his ability to run the clock backward and forward and present second chances to certain individuals whose lives ARE the plot of The French Lieutenant's Woman.<br /><br />Set in the late 1860's and early 1870's, mostly in the southwest of England, this is the psychological and sociological story of Sarah Woodruff, the title character, and Charles Smithson, an idealistic paleontologist who falls in love with her. Though she is locally called \\"Poor Tragedy\\" (along with other less respectful names like  w hore) slender, beautiful Sarah is a beguiling figure of mystery who captivates the romantic Charles simply by her distant presence. As he walks the local sea cliffs in search of fossil remains of earlier life forms, the visiting Charles, already engaged to wed a wealthy merchant's daughter, often sees Sarah standing alone on the shore, staring wistfully into the impenetrable distance, speaking to no one, unmoving for stretches of what seems to be hours, and he becomes obsessed with her. He seeks to know her and heal her of whatever pains she bears that have driven her to such a state. However, Sarah rejects Charles and seeks no assistance from him or anyone else. Charles makes inquires and learns Sarah's tale. He hears how she became an outcast as a result of her risking everything for the love of a French naval officer, who jilted her when he left the English coast to return to his homeland. Rather than at that point pragmatically halting his desires for involvement with the melancholy Sarah, Charles instead casts aside all sense of caution and deepens his quest to become important to her. He is, by this point in this tale of love, morals and betrayal, lost in feelings for the French Lieutenant's woman that might well, in judgmental Victorian England, seal his doom as surely as Sarah's actions sealed her own.<br /><br />This is a difficult tale to relate in a review, and it slides easily into a discussion of themes in literature rather than its actual plot. I'll leave the storyline where I set it above, and gladly bequeath analysis of literary intricacies to others. I'll merely say in conclusion this is one of perhaps a hundred novels any lover of literature should be ashamed to die without having read.to his homeland.

Cyrus Spitama is one such man and he tells the story of his life in Gore Vidal's magnum opus, Creation.<br /><br />This novel, set in the near and far east of the fifth-century BC, has young Cyrus Spitama begin life witnessing the murder at the hands of nomadic barbarians, of his grandfather, the great Persian prophet Zoroaster. He then is sent to the Persian capital to be raised among the offspring of other Imperial dignitaries, and there comes to know and befriend Xerxes, future Emperor of much of the civilized world. Cyrus becomes a traveler on behalf of his royal master and journeys into India, where he encounters the glories of the Indus civilization, and finally into China, where among the unimaginable grandeur of the Middle Kingdom, he comes to know the rival philosophers whose beliefs will have the greatest impact on Asia for the next 2500 years: the esoteric Buddha and the earthly Confucius.<br /><br />Later, Cyrus Spitama will travel back to Persia and be at his king's side during the wars with Greece, and give us a version of those struggles that conflicts with the accepted western history of Persian defeat. Finally, as a blind old man of ninety, Cyrus sits with a distant relative, a young man of Athens, and relates all this, while a teenaged housebuilder named Socrates repairs a wall nearby and perhaps eavesdrops on the meanderings of a compelling foreigner.<br /><br />This is all sheer fantasy, of course, and there never was a Cyrus Spitama, but that's the fault of history, not Vidal, who revives the best and most stunning glories of a world known to few westerners, and creates a novel I enjoyed. The scene where Xerxes and Cyrus Spitama, as teenage friends, enter the sealed tomb of the founder of the Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great (of Biblical fame) is alone worth the investment of energy reading this hefty novel takes. But there are plenty more events in Creation to capitate the devoted reader and I could never list all of them here.<br /><br />This is a thinking person's fantasy at its most elevated.the investment of energy reading this hefty novel takes.

Might be a good place to start looking, thought I. And gee was I right! Did you know there are books out there that show the most amazing stuff? Wow am I stumped!

I mean honestly, check out page eighty-three, where that nice middle-aged couple is doing something interesting with one another called \\"Head To Toe\\". Did you know the human body could bend like that? I do yoga almost every morning and contortions of that nature were news to me. And just look at the expression on that woman's face. Is she thinking hard about someone else, or what? Wowee-kazowee! And what about page one-fifteen. Exactly why is that nice girl lying down on top of her own hand and closing her eyes? Heck if I know.

Yeah, a confession after all these years that the gift wasn't strictly 'un-used'. Anyway, I won't go into the plot of Scream, anyone reading this probably already knows it better than I do, having only seen it twice, but I will note that devoid of its visuals (beyond a few movie freeze-frames included in the book) Williamson's writing in this script comes off as better than I remember it being in Scream. Its campiness is elevated to funnier than on screen, its pop culture/film references seem more apt, and the twist the run-time builds up to is reinforced as decently unexpected. (The screenplay also spares the reader a lot of the visual violence that distracts in the case of reading for the sake of broadening insight into the spoken words of a film.) I've read scripts to a few other movies, the best being The Usual Suspects, and every time I've thought how it's a shame more people don't read the scripts to their favorite films, and how un-selfserving that more directors don't publish their screenplays.<br /><br />Scream isn't a favorite of mine, and it's not high art but if you like the movie, pick this up sometime.

There have been many attempts throughout human history by one group to exterminate another but few have been so successful or complete and that of the Catholic Church against a religion called Catharism. In Destiny of Fire, novelist Zoe Oldenbourg recreates the era that saw the height and also the end of this thriving culture that had reached something like social dominance in southwestern France by the start of the thirteenth-century.<br /><br />The Cathars, for those who may not know, were a sect that rose from Christianity and believed in an ongoing struggle in the universe between the realm of spirit, which was pure, and the realm of matter (our physical world) which was hopelessly corrupt. They practiced a rejection of most worldly things, lived celibate non-materialistic lives of truth and simplicity, and had but one prayer: The Our Father/Lord's Prayer, spoken by Jesus. In their devotion to reaching a state of communion with otherworldliness, Cathars defied the riches and regimentation of the dominant Catholic Church, and soon fell into disfavor with that institution.<br /><br />In the Crusade declared against this religion, which at its height numbered into the hundreds of thousands and was spreading into all corners of Christendom, the Church promised riches and forgiveness of sins for any who rose up and slaughtered Cathars wherever they were to be found: men, women, children. The ensuing violence directed against these people makes for a tragic tale, indeed. Oldenbourg spares us no detail of the cruelty and savagery of the holocaust of the Cathars. Scarcely any of her many characters in this novel, Cathars of all ages and backgrounds and walks of life, escape tragic demises. She also does a superlative job of detailing exactly what Cathars believed, and how they synthesized those beliefs into a day-to-day existence. Her novel is a plausible and interesting picture of a time and place in the Medieval world.<br /><br />If after reading Destiny of Fire, you should find yourself wondering why it is this mass-murder of perhaps a million human beings is so little known today, consider my explanation in the opening of this review, but also know that for centuries, perhaps even today if the ban was never actually lifted, the Catholic Church imposed a gag order that mandated in effect that any mention of the Cathars must condemn them as heretical practitioners of anti-Christian evil, and any reference to the \\"Holy War\\" against them must be made in the form of praise at the righteousness of the Church's actions.

If after reading Destiny of Fire, you should find yourself wondering why it is this mass-murder of perhaps a million human beings is so little known today, consider my explanation in the opening of this review, but also know that for centuries, perhaps even today if the ban was never actually lifted, the Catholic Church imposed a gag order that mandated in effect that any mention of the Cathars must condemn them as heretical practitioners of anti-Christian evil, and any reference to the \\"Holy War\\" against them must be made in the form of praise at the righteousness of the Church's actions.

What more can be said through film, right? The human brain can only hear so many hundreds of times the horrors the Nazis visited upon the Jews of Poland and the Pale, before the brain shrugs and goes, \\"Heard it all before, sorry for your sufferings, move along.\\" And that's not how it should be. Of COURSE the attempted extermination of the Ashkenazi Jews is an atrocity that should fill us all with revulsion and make us one and all affirm that we shall do all we can to prevent anything like that from happening again.<br /><br />Maus, Art Spiegelman's very personal and completely true tale of his late father's life in Poland, where he initially fights the German invasion as a soldier, kills a German attempting to infiltrate his nation, and later goes from a POW to a concentration camp inmate, is shocking simply because it presents this too-often-told story from a perspective new to the reader: the cartoon strip.<br /><br />In this unique work, the Jews are drawn as mice, the Nazis as vicious felines and other anthropomorphic roles are assigned to those among divergent populations relevant to the history of the time. Maus is a story so terrifying it makes your skin crawl, and so tragic it might well induce tears. It reaches into the psyche in ways the multitude of well-intended but flatlining documentaries on the Holocaust simply cannot in this day and age.<br /><br />Maus has always received critical praise but it should have gotten a Nobel Prize in literature or art. Yes, I really believe that.	2005-08-27

If for nothing else than her iron-hard, Churchillian stance against the IRA in the 1980's---thus in the face of no British pullout from Northern Ireland sparing the Republic in the south from dealing with the fighting in Ulster---she rates all right in my eyes. She rose to power in her own party in a time when even in matriarchal Great Britain women were not supposed to be able to make it to the top. She also orchestrated the defeat of the entrenched if unpopular Labour Party in the 1970's by taking the minds and souls of her countrymen back to more glorious times of Empire. If there is any doubt that so many parallels can be drawn between her and her contemporary US counterpart Ronald Reagan, then consider how expertly she used one-liners and power slogans in her own campaigns and political battles. (\\"Labour Is Not Working\\" a popular banner of the late-70's is probably the best and most clever tool her party employed.)<br /><br />In this memoir of the Downing Street years, Thatcher does only one thing wrong in my view and that's how she drifts too often into self-congratulation. I mean, that's the only way I can say it. Instead of sticking to facts and letting society and history be her jury, she appears perfectly content to do it herself. If \\"humility is truth\\" maybe in a way her take on herself is a virtue, I don't know, but to me, it came off as a slight faux pas.<br /><br />The Prime Minister a reader meets in these topic-by-topic discussions of events germane to her lengthy time in office (she outlasted two US Presidents and nearly a third) is a capable, tough, self-confident personage who was probably the best and most fitting person to lead her nation at that moment.	2005-08-26

It's exactly the same concept but set all in the state of Ohio instead of the entire US. My favorite picture in the collection is the one where the little girl in my hometown of Mason is reading concealed under the covers of her bed, obviously past her bedtime. Exactly like I used to do! This book is full of photographs that cover the range from the warm and familiar, like I cited above, to the majestic, the disturbing, the celebratory, and the remarkable. It captures Ohio from end to end and I'd be willing to bet at least 1 Ohioan in 10 probably, me included, knows somebody in these hundreds of pictures. It's well worth the price.	2005-08-26

I inherited this book from a friend after she'd had her baby (hello, Mandy) and while I'm not 100% certain why I read it, I'll admit before the world here that I did. Belly Laughs is not long, it's triple-spaced and user-friendly, sometimes funny, frequently so gross I wouldn't recommend it for lunchtime reading, but it showed me Jenny McCarthy remains as goofy as she used to be on MTV. She is candid about the physical woes of pregnancy, and a few of these as yet non-experienced delights were news to me. Basically after this I'm now terrified of the possible side effects of hanging around with men, so if I enter a convent because of Jenny, I wonder if I can sue her? Any lawyers reading this want to chase a Playmate-shaped ambulance with me? Seriously, this light trip through conception (although not as much time is spent there as any male readers might like) to delivery is mostly harmless fun and any pregnant woman with twenty bucks burning a hole in her purse could spend it on something less worth having. (I guess.)<br /><br />I understand Jenny McCarthy wrote a sequel. Hmm. I think I'll pass for now and only imagine what shudder-inducing tales of her first year as a mommy she scoots along there.	2005-08-26

Here we can read of Henry puttering away a pleasant afternoon with his soon-to-be third wife, the prim and modest Miss Seymour, while waiting to hear the cannon blast from the Tower that announces his second wife Anne has been conveniently parted from her head courtesy of a French swordsman. (You know it takes a lot of something-or-other to kill off your own child's mother, king or not.)<br /><br />Nothing is left out from this story of England's most famous king. Here a reader will find the stories of each of his wives, the run-in with the Pope, the show-downs with More, Wolsey and Cromwell, and Henry's version of why he packed on that extra two-hundred pounds. Through it all, page by page, Henry excuses himself of everything, and I think Margaret George gets it right, this IS how Henry VIII would have told it and how he truly thought it was in his mind. George does a fine job of recreating the 16th century and despite this being a long book, it never drags or slips in its quality. The Autobiography is filled to bursting with great characters and information about the world in that age. It's worth the fortnight it might take to read it all the way through.	2005-08-26

James presents a mind-igniting concept: what if for unknown reasons, the men on planet earth became infertile? Set in the very near future, in an England cruelly devoid of the presence of childen, the moribund human race is getting through its last days, primed for extinction by the fact the last human child born on this earth was a boy in Argentina more than two decades before. This is a society where playgrounds have been bulldozed because the memory of what they used to be is too cruel. It is a time and place where schools are now hospices for the dying, where the optimism is simply dead in every man and woman alive. In this bleak world, the old are celebrated as patriots if they allow themselves to be terminated and thus spare the middle-aged population the burden of caring for them. It is a culture where the soul has left democracy and Britain is run by a dictatorial figure called simply \\"the Warden\\". If all this were not bleak enough, then also bear in mind that this dismal reality is bolstered by reports in our own world of 2005 that the fertility of human males IS in fact in rapid decline. Let's hope the story of The Children of Men never comes to pass.	2005-08-26

It took me about a year after I read Bonfire of the Vanities before I liked it, so maybe Charlotte Simmons will age well, too, in my view, but as for now, having just finished this ten-pounds worth of novel, I think it sucked.<br /><br />I've only been out of college four years, and, Mr. Wolfe, it's NOT like that. Why on earth did you at seventy-whatever attempt to set this story in modern times? It might have had some charm and truth if it took place in the 1950's, but today? There were parts in this novel where Wolfe was being dead-on serious and I erupted with laughter. I apologize for the rudeness of doing that and even more for telling I did, but, hey, I'm being honest. It's not that someone can't possibly have a book set in the 2000's where the plot revolves around an unnaturally innocent virgin and will-she-or-won't-she, it's that this error-riddled piece of unlikable prose had few good characters, especially Charlotte Simmons, herself. Despite her rural, impoverished roots, it's nice Wolfe doesn't portray her as a mouth-breathing hick, but he also doesn't give her much depth beyond the designation (all in caps here) \\"VIRGIN!!!\\"<br /><br />But hey, on the plus side, I'll never be able to hear the word \\"Astroturf\\" without giggling at its use in this book.<br /><br />Almost everything that could have been wrong here was. The plot was thin, the length of the book was long, the college-age characters were implausible, and the sex was put out there with all the charm of Catholic-school biology textbook. The real truth is, an attractive openly-identified virgin on any university campus in this decade wouldn't have been short on dates, she'd have been zeroed-in on by every red-blood male for twenty miles around, including townies, married men, frat boys and Baptist divinity students.<br /><br />This book was daft!	2005-08-26

I'll unabashedly say I read a half-dozen of these books a year, though I left membership in that demographic in the last decade.<br /><br />Australian John Marsden's novel might stun post-teen readers with how good it is. Not a clich&eacute; in sight, the writing is not watered-down, and it's more intelligently plotted than most of what's published for \\"adults\\".<br /><br />This is an epistolatory novel, set over one year. Read between the lines: that's where the true story lies. Things start when sixteen-year-old Mandy answers an ad placed by Tracey, another sixteen-year-old, seeking a pen-pal. At first letters between this pair are the expected m&eacute;lange of teenage thoughts and goings-on, but rapidly we get the hint that matters aren't as idyllic in Tracey's life as Tracey leads on. No, this isn't another after-school special where one girl rescues another from abuse, drugs, or any other calamity accounting for most of the fare in teen stories. This is different. It does not slip the reins of realism for one second.<br /><br />If you want to be surprised, stop here. Otherwise....<br /><br />....I'll finish. See, Tracey is not truly living the idealistic life about which she first tells Mandy. Tracey's incarcerated for a violent crime that shames her. She faces a sentence that will keep her behind bars well into adult life. Mandy on the other hand comes from a middle-class background with married parents and a brother who .... is not well-adjusted. As the letters come and the story unfolds, we begin to understand that Mandy needs to tell Tracey her problems probably more than Tracey does Mandy. Though they've never met, this is a friendship with great meaning to each of the girls. Over the year, we really get inside their minds and feel for them. We want Tracey to have a second-chance and the future Mandy, free in the outside world, can have. And we want Mandy to never outgrow her friend who is far away and miserable with the circumstances her actions have put her in.<br /><br />We want a lot of things to be different from how we learn they are.<br /><br />Let me end by confessing that this book delivers one of the most emotionally-wrenching conclusions ever written. No, I don't exaggerate. I'll offer this advice: don't read Marsden's book if you think you might not be up to a suggestive ending that hits very, very hard.

Hey, don't waste time reading this pedantic review, because you can finish WTWTA cover-to-cover in about as long. Go! Really! Get this book! Run!<br /><br />Well, if you're still here, let me try a second time to convince you. WTWTA (as we in the cool crowd call it...) is the wonderful tale of a little boy named Max, who dresses in his wolf suit and proceeds to run amok through his house, chasing his dog with a fork and making so much noise and mischief that he gets sent to his room. Ah, but rather than ending there, the story takes off. (Bet you never saw that coming, didya?) Max either imagines what comes next or--as I prefer to see it--is transported into another dimension, where Wild Things, some of the hippest, wildest-looking creatures this side of Budhuhastania live. To get there, Max sails in and out of a year and lands where the wild things are. Initially the Wild Things size Max up as a pre-dinner snack, but Max isn't scared of them. Nope, he tames them with a look and bids them to \\"BE STILL\\". And they do. The Wild Things recognize in Max a kindred spirit and make him their ruler. They begin a wild rumpus and dance and howl and party all night. It's a great sort of life.<br /><br />And I bloody wish the book had ended here, but...<br /><br />Well eventually Max becomes tired of his job as king and plots a return home. The Wild Things, being less than overjoyed to hear the news of their king's abdication, plead with him not to go and promise, \\"We'll eat you up, we love you so!\\"<br /><br />Oooohh, heavy stuff indeed. Do the Wild Things feast upon fillet of Max? Sorry to leave you on the edge of your seat, but you'll have to travel through all dozen pages of Where The Wild Things Are to find out for yourself.<br /><br />Unhesitantly recommended by me, Mr. Sendak's lifelong fan.	2005-08-26

Heat-Moon, whose previous works have included a 400-page in-depth microcosmic study of a single Kansas county and a journey by car across rural America, is a legend among those who live life off the beaten trail. In River Horse, the author moves downriver from town to town across the Hudson, Ohio, Mississippi, Missouri and other waterways and meets and greets countless locals along the way. This portrait of the interior of America that lies beside its water highways is deservedly classic.	2005-08-25

Led Zeppelin is either the most over-rated band in rock history, or the least respected great band of all time. You decide. In this book, Led Zep,the ultimate arena band of the '70's is subjected to a prose review that alternates between a sycophant's fawning praise and a reporter's damning crtique. Somewhere in the middle of those extremes a picture emerges of four blues-loving musicians with clashing egos, a lot of talent, and a wild streak that found expression on a canvas of orgies, drinking marathons and obliterated hotel suites. In among details of the bandmembers insatiable lusts for drugs, booze, fast cars and faster women, we are reminded this quartet from the English midlands also gave us Stairway To Heaven,  Black Dog, In The Light, No Quarter, and a score of other all-time great recordings. Hammer of the Gods is a fun,  no-holds barred read that once in a while comes off as having needed one more round of pre-publication facts-checking, but it's still a spirited road trip with a band sure to be among the titans of rock and roll.	2005-08-25

What else could Rachael Ray be doing to make her show any more interesting, or this book more value for the buck? This book, like her show, is a light, happy breeze-thru of the best spots in selected cities in Europe and North America, where Ms. Ray's challenge is to find the most colorful, noteworthy and appealing dining establishments, while keeping economy in mind. She always does this with style and charm and pleasantry otherwise generally lacking on TV. The two-dozen or thereabout locales highlighted in this book excerpt restaurants and recipes featured on the televised version of 40 Dollars A Day, and make an equally nice read for those planning a vacation or just wanting to know more about the culinary landscape beyond their hometown.	2005-08-24

Yep, it's a novel composed of free-verse poetry. But don't let that scare you. This book is a quick, fun read that moves along without any hitches or slow spots. It tells us about a teenage girl named Ruby, who moves from the east coast to Hollywood after the death of her mother. Ruby leaves behind a boyfriend, her best friend, and everyone and everything she has ever known, to be with a father she's barely met. It doesn't make things out in \\"Hollyweird\\" any easier that her father is Whip Logan, one of the biggest stars on the A-list or that this private time in her life is splashed across tabloids and news shows. Oh, and there's the little matter of how much Ruby detests her dad. And who can blame her since he's never shown any interest in her during her whole life. Or has he?<br /><br />This novel can easily be finished in one sitting, but it accesses more feeling than most books double its size. It's a nice reading experience, and not just for the \\"young person\\" demographic towards which it is being marketed.	2005-08-23

Sophie is struggling through the usual sturm und drang of her age, along with such custom-made worries as \\"will I be the tallest girl in school?\\" She sometimes doesn't get along with her mom, wonders if her dad even notices she's alive, and on top of all that, she frequently feels she's part of the only Jewish family on an earth filled with Christians.<br /><br />In this book Sophie develops a major crush for ultra-cool Dylan, and is convinced she's in love with him even while sometimes he makes her wonder if he's really the right boy for her. Later, after she and Dylan burn out and part ways, she secretly falls head over heels for Murphy, who is--bummer of bummers--the class nerd. Sophie likes Murphy a lot, but she knows she'll be teased if her friends catch her out with him. She is forced to decide which is more important to her, being cool in her friends' eyes, or being with Murphy.<br /><br />Sonya Sones is both a poet and a novelist, and in the case of What My Mother Doesn't Know, she's both at the same time. I found this to be the kind of story that took me back a decade to my own teen years, and made me miss them....and also be glad they're over. I can't wait to see what Sones publishes next.	2005-08-23

He thought it was one of the greatest books he'd ever read and he even wrote the author to tell him so. I think it's fair to say my expectations were set high. After reading Articles of War, I had mixed feelings. That's probably normal. I could understand Heck, the main character's fears in battle, his dread of death and his desire to return home again. All those register to me as perfectly sane. Yet I also know that in times of war, sacrifice is often called for, courage is mandated and the life of one person or even many people are held as acceptable trades for the achivement of victory. Did Heck know all this, too, or did such things cease to be important to him under the blaze of enemy guns? I began to consider, as Arvin no doubt intended, how I might conduct myself in combat. Would my reactions be those of a disgraceful soldier like Heck, or would I distinguish myself with my bravery? Honestly, while I hope for the latter, I do not know.<br /><br />Articles of War is a deft, economical piece of writing that concentrates its story down to the barest of essentials. To say that Arvin's prose is \\"terse\\" doesn't do its short, descriptive bursts justice. It is by turns dismal and dismaying and continues a recent trend in portraying \\"the last good war\\" as the bloody hell it surely must have been.<br /><br />This is the sort of book that sticks with you for months, and long after it is read it is one that makes the reader think about the worth of individual life in a time of international emergency, and (as someone who has never been in the military) makes me consider how I might conduct myself were I in a life or death firefight.<br /><br />Thanks for reading this review, and thanks, Mr. Arvin, for writing Articles of War.	2005-08-23

All right, then, it is this. Caputo created an account of his service experiences in the early part of America's military involvement in Vietnam, that is so crystal clear, I couldn't stand it. It was too close to being an eye-witness to events I did not want to witness or know about. Oh, I finished the book and even did a paper on it in college, but God alive, this was a read that wrenched emotion out of me on every page.<br /><br />Leaving behind life as a slightly privileged suburban kid in 1960's America, Caputo enlisted in the Marines Corps and became an officer. He was then sent straight off to Vietnam in about 1965, the height of US confidence for quick and total victory over this Third World opponent. What Caputo and his men encountered was a ruthless, determined foe who confronted them remorselessly in this tropical hell. Over the next year, Caputo is changed by his time in this \\"low-intensity\\" war until he is transformed into someone capable of ordering the execution of apparent Communist terrorists, who may have been nothing more than civilians in the wrong place at the wrong time. Caputo and several of his men are tried for this deed and had the sentiment regarding Vietnam been as volatile as it later became, he would perhaps have been convicted and jailed, but as it was, he escaped punishment and returned home a disillusioned cynic with \\"an above average service record.\\"<br /><br />A Rumor Of War is everything a memoir of a soldier ought to be. It is brutal, it pulls no punches and spares no detail, and thus it is disturbing in the extreme. I recognized this book's value in its achievement, but I did not like it. I think anyone who reads Caputo's account will understand what I mean.	2005-08-23

I guess I'm leaving myself open to accusations of being a tree-hugging pacifist, but even allowing that the boy in the story was from another era and culture, I hated what he was doing. It wasn't just the fact he was hunting and killing massive amounts of animals, it was the fact Mr. Rawls expected me to sympathize while the boy felled the oldest tree in the forest, a thing of antiquity, in order to avail himself of a cornered raccoon. See, it's that sort of thing that rubbed me the wrong way. Sure, the young man was in many ways a fine person. he was hard-working and honest, generous to his sisters and he honored his elders. But, while I understand he lived in an area where nature was a force to be battled against, I can't help but think of how the unrestrained misuse of resources by people of his and earlier generations created many of the problems society had to deal with later on.<br /><br />Okay, I'll stop. I'm probably stepping on more than a few toes and my iconoclasm toward this much-loved novel will get me few favors, but I was shocked by how little empathy I had toward what I read here. Obviously I didn't much care for this book and think better examples of the \\"boy and his dog\\" genre are out there.<br /><br />But I respectfully say, to each her own.	2005-08-23

Back when this book was written she was still taken seriously and the confidence widespread acclaim gave her shows. I'm not sure she would or even could produce this work today.<br /><br />I admire Jewel for writing this book. It isn't an exercise in self-flattery, nor is it a place-by-place memoir of her life. What Jewel created is almost more a confession than an autobiography. She tells of what it was like to grow up in rural poverty in Alaska, the only girl in a family of boys, and describes the hardships she faced in that life. A gifted performer and musically talented from a young age onward, Jewel and her family would perform concerts at bars and on stages through her home state. She tells of this part of her life, and moves forward into an adolescence spent homeless and living in a car. She talks about relationships and friendships, loss and the influences behind many of of her most personal songs, including the real life story behind her sad ballad Adrian. This is not only a book for fans of Jewel, it also works for anyone interested in reading a frank, unpretentious life story.	2005-08-23

I like to think I'm an open-minded person and truly believe that in a universe as vast and miraculous as ours, almost anything could be possible. I also try to be politely respectful of other people's views and values, whether or not they coincide with my own. I'm no devout theist, nor am I offended by sacrilege, but I do lose patience when people waste my time. And a waste of time is what this ridiculous book was and is. How on earth could so many other reviewers rate Conversations With God so highly? I wanted to look the writer in the eye and tell him, \\"Oh, come ON.\\"<br /><br />Shame on this guy!<br /><br />This work claims to be the result of its author having long heart-to-heart conversations with none other than God Himself. Yep, God. The Head Honcho, the Man Upstairs, The Spirit In The Sky, the inventor of sex, light, eating and DNA. Yet God can't even carry on a convincing line of prose. God can invent math, gravity and radio waves, yet God can't write. I mean it. I typed some of this into WORD and asked it to grade for content and the opinion came back that this book was penned at a third-grade level. What the author (I won't even award this guy a modicum of fame by mentioning him here by name) gives a reader is an example of greeting card/self-help/feel good messages and New Age lines re-heated from the 1970's. There is nothing ground-breaking here, nothing original, nothing new, nothing wise, nothing worthwhile. Most of all there is NOTHING to suggest it came from the brain of the Almighty. And in spite of all that, I'm 100% sure the guy who wrote all this will make a lot of money off it.<br /><br />A book co-authored by God? Oh, please...	2005-08-23

Where later books never seem to step entirely away from the cloud Cobain's death at age twenty-seven cast over the short history of Nirvana, Come As You Are is often funny, always descriptive, and slants toward what looked at the time of its publication, to be an influential future for this ground-breaking trio. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about the roots of the best band of the Grunge era.	2005-08-23

Sometimes he succeeds at this and sometimes he does not. In Julian he achieves his goals brilliantly as he informs the modern reader of the struggle between the relatively new religion of Christianity, and ancient paganism in its death throes. This book is also a descriptive recounting of civil wars, societal decline, politics and everyday life, all set in a 4th-century world on the path to eventual transition from classical to Medieval. It is exciting and it is also tragic. Julian, even when Vidal quotes directly from his own written words, seems a distinctly modern man, rather the lover of past times he was even in his own age. He was someone who clearly received bad press after his death, and did not deserve it, since he was no tyrant, and unlike the Christian rulers before and after him, he allowed freedom of worship according to conscience for Christians, Jews, pagans and all others. Through Gore Vidal's book, I met one of the more interesting figures from the ancient world, and I'm glad I did.	2005-08-23

Although I have an aunt who is a lawyer, and she assures me an eye-witness account is too-often fraught with factual errors, in my mind there is nothing else to match reading information written by someone who was directly THERE to see, hear, feel or touch the event being described. I've owned this book for years and still never get tired of referring to it. Want to read what a contemporary resident of the city has to say about a plague that brought Athens to a standstill in 330 BC? There's one in here. How about the death of Socrates? It's covered, and so is the moon landing in 1969, along with Pliny's description of Vesuvius' eruption that buried Pompeii. There are events great and small, reporters famous and forgotten, incidents trivial and earth-changing. You can find written descriptions of primitive surgeries, learn what a dinner date with Attila the Hun was like, and wince at the beheadings of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Louis XVI of France. In this book there are about four-hundred events covered from a first-hand perspective, and I found virtually all of them engrossing. I know of no other collection that brings so many noteworthy anecdotes into one volume. It's well worth the price and the reading-time put into it.	2005-08-23

Jeesh, I mean there was the fact she almost certainly had her demented husband, who just happened to be the Czar, conveniently snuffed, she enacted brutal laws in retaliation for a wee bit of disloyalty on behalf of the Russian peasantry, and, well, let's not forget that nasty rumor about how fond she was of horses. Ahem. But you know, this was also one of the greatest rulers in Russian history, a pen-pal of Voltaire, hand-picked agent of Frederick the Great, and above all else, an improbable survivor against whom the deck was stacked pretty high.<br /><br />I think Catherine used these memoirs to sway the public's feelings about her. That's a nice way of saying I suspect the ol' gal fibbed a time or two. But so what? This is still an invaluable first-hand account of a time and place about which we might otherwise have known far less than we do, but for courtesy of her gifted prose. Sure, Catherine wasn't perfect but she wasn't a monster, either, as so many other Russian rulers have been. She had a good sense of humor, she liked to read and she made an art of political pragmatism. Catherine also tried to do what was right (especially what was right for her) and early in her reign, this German on the Russian throne brought about a number of amazingly liberal reforms that ended laws that were suffocating Mother Russia, even during the Age of Enlightenment.<br /><br />I say, let historians debate all they want, Catherine deserved to have her say and her point of view is privileged. If for nothing else than the details of her era, this memoir is worth its weight in sable and caviar.	2005-08-23

Reading Bride Of The Far Side made me remember how great Gary Larson's daily dose mentally deranged cartoons were. I grew up reading his strip and boy do I miss him. In this collection of about two-hundred Far Sides, he carries on his tradition of good-natured insanity. Almost every cartoon in the book made me laugh, grin or at least go, \\"Eeeeewwww!\\" More than a few also made me stop and think. See, Larson is, in his better moments (which describes most of his moments) also a man of profound insight and deep thought. You have to keep your mind on its toes (yuck) to follow his punchlines. I do sincerely wish he'd make a return to the daily papers, or at least be more forthcoming with brand new material released in book form. I'd love to see that. Until the coming of that glorious day, I'll keep myself entertained with his '80's and '90's anthologies like Bride Of The Far Side, which is a truly awesome book!	2005-08-23

On January, 20, 1961, President John F. Kennedy invited the aged Robert Frost to come south from his New Hampshire farm and recite a poem on the occasion of his inauguration. Asked by a reporter why he chose to honor Frost with this invitation, Kennedy quite sincerely said, \\"It is Mr. Frost who honors me.\\"<br /><br />I can say with no disrespect to the office of President that Kennedy's sentiment was very true, for our Chief Executives come and go, but the works of Robert Frost will surely endure thru millennia.<br /><br />Robert Frost is probably America's most well-know poet and arguably its best, and in these collections we are privileged to read the words Frost penned in his relative youth, with so much acclaim lying unseen ahead of him. Here are the words that stir the soul and call us into cold New England autumns of long ago. Here are the lines that would later resonate in ten-million minds, bravely sent forth into an uncertain reception by a Frost still young and yet unheralded. Here, on the once-blank page, the spirit of rural New England of nearly a century ago is waiting to speak to all of us.<br /><br />An unqualified achievement of absolute genius. I truly pity anyone who passes through a lifetime without reading these poems.	2005-08-22

So it was a slight surprise that I discovered she had turned her hand at the haunted house genre. And what an excellent job she did, too! In fact, I would go so far as to put this in among the five or so scariest books I've ever read. It's up there in a league with Hill House and The Shining. The mere memory of this novel, which I initially read five years ago, is creeping me out tonight as I type this review. I'm not kidding.<br /><br />The House Next Door (doesn't the very name sound ominous?) takes the conventions of its venerable genre and casts them through the basement window. Forget a run-down old mansion, the house in the title is a brand new, lovely dwelling place constructed in suburban Atlanta in the booming 1970's. It sits among other equally gorgeous houses and on the surface seems a highly unlikely location for a tale as dark and eerie as this one becomes.<br /><br />I hate when a gloriously layered story is wrecked by a ham-handed reviewer, so I'll say very little else except that the nature of the \\"hauntings\\" in the house are not of the usual variety. Ghostly entities do not creep and moan among cobwebs and whisper in Victorian lace. No, Siddons masterfully spooks us with the very trappings of our modern existence. (Read this book and you'll know EXACTLY what I mean.) By the last thirty pages, I was totally stumped but very \\"into\\" what I was reading. When the cause behind so many vividly malignant effects is made clear to us in Siddons' fine twist ending, a literal, \\"Oh, my gosh...!\\" escaped my lips.<br /><br />Folks, I like this book as you can tell. I have nothing bad to say about it at all. If you want my advice, forego the slasher novellas and tired clich&eacute;s of the horror aisle and pick this overlooked gem up next time you want to be thoroughly creeped out!	2005-08-22

Written in the second-person rather the otherwise de rigueur first or third, this novel is the story of a young man's plummet from the life to which he'd always dreamed (position at a prestigious literary magazine, beautiful wife, friends in the social in-class) to a nagging, tormented hell in which each new day greets him with the mocking revelation of what he has become. This character, primarily called simply \\"You\\" throughout the book, is burnt-out professionally and socially. His cocaine usage has surpassed destructive levels, the wife whom he brought to the city from a rural dead-end life is divorcing him, and the first-anniversary of his mother's death (which he has so far avoided dealing with via drugs and the fast life) is approaching and with it an obligatory meeting with the family he's tried hard to leave behind.<br /><br />Is this the study of a soul doomed beyond reprieve to post-modern Hell, or is it the bitter darkness before the dawn? At novel's end we are left with reasons to hope it is the latter, and as we depart from the story within this barely-more-than-a-novella, we want the young man with whom we've spent the last hundred-some pages to cling to the possible escape Mcinerney has set just within his reach.<br /><br />One can read Bright Lights, Big City in about as long as it takes to sit through the less-worthy film version. I'd recommend the chilly gut-punch of Mcinerney's prose to anyone who appreciates the future classics among late-twentieth century literature.	2005-08-22

Once it was in my hands I sat and delightedly read it start to finish in one long, chilly New England day. What a wonderful memory...<br /><br />This book, released to coincide with the twentieth anniversary of For Better Or For Worse, is much more than an anthology or trip down memory lane, it is a revelation of the lives that Lizzie, Michael, John, Elly and the gang have going on beyond what we're told in the comic strip each day. Oh, sure, someone is probably reading this and thinking, \\"these are fictional characters and have no lives, either in the daily paper or beyond it.\\" Right? Well...let's say they do. For instance, I was tickled to learn of a secret crush Lizzie had as a teenager that was never revealed in the strip (I won't say for whom) and I liked hearing that Phil and Georgia, scarcely seen in the strip in a decade, were still married and doing well, and that most of the families mentioned at one point or another in the neighborhood remained around. I also found it a real treat to have the hsitory of how John and Elly met, roughly a decade before the strip began, told in the form of an illustrated story. (How young they both looked back then!) Okay, I admit it, having followed this family for most of my life (it came out, I believe, the year I was born) they do seem like real people to me, and I mean that as a tribute to the talent of Lynn Johnston.<br /><br />The title of this work really says it all, and if you're a FBOFW fan who wants to find out more of the personal history of each member of the Patterson family, then this is where to go.	2005-08-22

Smokey cheerfully crosses the bridge from the class-smothered old south of her roots, to the new south which spreads around her like a banquet. She steps forward into a dream job with a progressive arts and culture magazine, and begins a series of romantic and political adventures, the likes of which she could not have dreamed back in her native Savannah. Smokey comes to know members of the civil rights movement, including Martin Luther King, and is there at its height, before its is replaced in the public consciousness by the more radical protest movement against the Vietnam War.<br /><br />Smokey's story easily fills the pages of Downtown and succeeds because she is in her optimistic innocence, fulfilling the sort of dream so many women of all times and places have had. Who does not aspire to leave behind the past and leap face-forward into a new and better life where a real difference for the best can be achieved? In the enjoyable tale called Downtown, we get to live vicariously through Smokey's triumph.<br /><br />A fine novel that resurrects a time and place and should be a worthy read for almost anyone.	2005-08-22

This is a sci-fi-flavored telling of what human history might have been like had the Black Death of the 14th century wiped out 99% of Europe's population. What remains is a world divided into two competing spheres of influence: China in all its glory, and the Islamic culture in its ambition. Robinson follows the next eight centuries as humanity recovers from this devastation, and we read on to discover industrialization coming several centuries later than it did in our time (and arriving first in India, no less). We watch the unfolding of a terrible mechanized war that encompasses virtually all of humanity and decides whether it is the east or west (or neither...) who will reign globally-supreme. In this novel, the Chinese colonize North America, Muslims move into Europe, and unified American Indians elevate themselves to technological standards unknown to them in our timeline.<br /><br />These chapters are framed by an interesting device: reincarnation. Our protagonists are a trio of souls who are born again and again from China to the Near East, to the San Francisco Bay region, France, Japan, and Istanbul, and so that we can identify them in each incarnation, they keep the same first letter of their names each time.<br /><br />The Years of Rice And Salt is full of excitement and intellectual stimulation, yet it also drags in more than a few chapters. But still, what Robinson has accomplished is a fine novel indeed.	2005-08-22

Soooo, let me say this: Mississippi native Donna Tartt knows how to draw a reader in by promising major revelations later. She also knows how to develop realistic, fascinating and unforgettable characters. I just wish she knew how to fulfill her promise and also DO something with these finely-sketched characters. Unfortunately The Little Friend doesn't go anywhere, doesn't answer any of its own major questions, and ends a far less enjoyable and respectable novel than it began. It's in fact quite frustrating.<br /><br />That's what I have to say about it If you want to know more regarding the teasing setup for its anorexic plot, read the dust jacket. It will tell you all there is to know about this let-down of a novel that I was looking forward to for months and thought because of the way it began so well, was going to be a lot of fun.

The knowledge that this really, truly and for all time marked the ending of this voyage back to Cornwall of two centuries ago, made the book I had before me infinitely more meaningful.<br /><br />I do not think Graham intended to continue the series, even had death not taken him so soon after Bella Poldark was done. He was in his nineties and this novel is filled with omens that the end had been reached. (Ross illustrating to Demelza his thoughts on the brevity of life and futility of ongoing rancor with his remark on how in fifty years they'd all be gone and yet without them the tide would still rise to spout through the hole worn in the sea-cliff was one such example.)<br /><br />Graham left us with this gift of a book. It is probably the best in the section of the Poldark series since the titles \\"graduated\\" from the eighteenth to the nineteenth centuries. I read the other eleven Poldark volumes between 1995-1997 and in the years since they have frequently crossed my thoughts, along with certain unanswered questions. The lingering mystery of Valentine's paternity becomes an issue yet again and is resolved before the book's conclusion. The \\"curse\\" literal or fanciful that struck down both Stephen Carrington and Jeremy Poldark after their robbery of the Warleggan carriage emerges to inflict its harm on a participant in that long-ago event. Ross and George Warleggan verbally spar as they have done for forty years, and Bella, the beautiful, angelic-voiced final child of Demelza and Ross, takes to the stage, her spirit set on becoming an opera star.<br /><br />I wish the Poldark saga could have lasted forever, but since it could not, at least we had this one last visit among old friends to console us before our departure.	2005-08-22

Sara Howard, intrepid writer and proto-feminist, Stevie, the former child criminal, John Moore a free-lance reporter, and Dr. Lazlo Kreizle, the psychological researcher from Carr's excellent psychological opus, The Alienist, are back in this return (not a sequel) to the mean streets of Manhattan circa 1897. Having been impressed as I was by Carr's previous novel of this time and place, I was understandably excited to get my hands on this one. But my excitement quickly dimmed somewhat when I discovered what a weaker imitation of his other novel this was.<br /><br />But maybe that's a trifle hard on Carr, since this is still an enjoyable (if slow) read and no one can turn out a near-perfect book every time.<br /><br />I think part of Carr's problem here was he made the incalculably huge mistake of ridding this story of virtually all overtones of mystery. Unlike the edge-of-your-seat ride in The Alienist, we know who the killer is and we know what she's done. What could have been a fine unraveling of clues is instead more of a cataloging of emerging modern investigative techniques and eventually a courtroom drama.<br /><br />This isn't a bad book by any means, but neither is it a great one. I loved the chapter where Theodore Roosevelt leads the charge into the gutters of New York, to take on gangs there in a bold act of rescue. I also was left to puzzle over, as Carr intended, what motivates a mother to violate all dictates of nature and kill her own children. In The Angel of Darkness the ice-cold crimes that make up the central plot are as disturbing as any of the passionate slayings in The Alienist.<br /><br />What was severely lacking in this novel was suspense. It just wasn't on a par with The Alienist, but....I'm still glad I read it.	2005-08-22

Beginning with the sack of Jerusalem by Romans in AD 70, the descendants of a scribe called simply \\"Abraham\\" record the births and deaths in a scroll that Abraham carried with him out from the burning city. We track his children and their children and their children on into Alexandria, Tours, Moorish Spain, and finally Poland at the time of the Nazi conquest of eastern Europe. As we pass from generation to generation, we encounter literally hundreds of men and women who can trace their heritage to the first Abraham of the Scroll.

So I won't. Instead, without challenging anyone else's opinions, I'll share my feelings on it, and tell something of the events of the novel, in case I may humbly aid anyone that might stray by who is unfamiliar with its details. (In which case I urge you to read Interview With The Vampire.)<br /><br />Anne Rice's undying masterpiece tells of the revelations in one long night in 1970's San Francisco, of a 200-year-old vampire named Louis, who lived, died, and was reborn as an undead being in 18th century New Orleans at the hands of the antiheroic Vampire Lestat. Louis is no mere vampire, but a keen observer of the worlds of man and the preternatural entities who share the earth with him. Louis is a sufferer, a soul in pain. In the last years of his mortal life, he lost his bride and sought death for himself. What he received in death's place was the Dark Gift, a condition of death within life/life within death, that makes him shun sunlight and thirst for the blood necessary to sustain himself in his new existence. Yet the Dark Gift also grants Louis and his kind immortality of sorts, and bestows them with abilities far surpassing those possessed by those living in the sunlight world of mankind.<br /><br />In Interview, there are other vampires sharing this life with Louis. There is the noble Lestat, Louis' flamboyant, deadly, creator. There is Claudia, a child vampire whose mind aged even while imprisoned forever in the body of a cherubic child. And later in the work there are the old covens of Europe, who fit the role of the vampires of legend: the dark, cruel beings of crypt and moonlight.<br /><br />This novel is, as I said at the start, a drug that transports its reader into another dimension.

He would write one entry per day in a diary that would record the events in his own life and in the world around him.<br /><br />Admirable.<br /><br />Koppel's notes on the goings-on in 1999 seem oddly distant in this post-911 world of 2005. Was the last year of the century just passed really quite as innocent as it seems in this record of a journalist and his travels across the world? That was the biggest point of notice I came away with from this remarkable read: exactly how much our society and the greater world has altered in so small a time.<br /><br />That said, it is still worthwhile to read through Koppel's thoughts on the happenings of that year and to gain perspective on all that went on in a top-ranking network journalist's life. In those twelve months, Koppel traveled to at least four continents, met with dozens of noteworthies, and also managed to fit in time at home, where he tells us of the joys of something small like a redecorating project after having spent so many of the previous weeks in and out of war zones, jets, vans, and studios. Koppel is never shy about giving his opinion and sometimes I admired his views, at other times he frankly ticked me off. That's probably someplace in his job description.<br /><br />I've heard Ted Koppel is retiring soon, and I wonder if he intends to devote more time to writing once his days in front of the camera are done? If this book is any indication of what that output might be, then I hope so.	2005-08-21

Long before anyone dared suggest such a notion in front of a wide audience, Titler challenged the accepted account that the Baron was downed by Canadian flyer Roy Brown, and proves beyond  a reasonable doubt, that a single bullet, a mere \\"lucky shot\\" from an Australian ground gunner, fatally injured the Red Baron in April 1918, and brought down his tri-plane.<br /><br />An interesting read for any WWI buff, and an engrossing one for anyone seeking to ferret out truth from fiction in the vastness of historical reporting.	2005-08-21

Grant)	Books	5	13	14	N	N	What A Gift For Immediacy She Had	Sadly Julia Dent Grant is little remembered in history today and in her lifetime this remarkable and bright woman placed herself so dutifully in the shadow of her great husband that even in her own time she was not given her proper due. Ever a loving mother and wife, Mrs. Grant was also gifted with many other talents: those of the observer, those of the writer, and most of all the gift of a storyteller.<br /><br />Mrs. Grant's remembrances of her life and half-century marriage to the President cover her happy childhood in Missouri, the early years in the Grant household, her husband's time as a career soldier and later a struggling businessman in Illinois, and take us into the Civil War years as no one else ever has before. She describes her friendships with a number of southern ladies, her feeling toward the Lincoln's (she admired the President yet found his wife difficult, petty, and unstable) and details the private side of number of figures from that period. Most of all she relates anecdotes that capture the courage, acumen and generosity of her husband as he dealt with  foe and comrade alike. The Grant she writes of was a fine man indeed.<br /><br />There is one feature I noticed right off in Mrs. Grant's book and that is her uneven pacing. By this I mean that she dedicates a large amount of space to some events but only a small amount to others, even though one would think they may be of greater importance to history. Mrs. Grant writes as often and in as much detail on the selection and furnishing of her houses as she does on the Civil War. She dedicates scant ink to the (unhappy) Grant Presidency but then allocates fully half the book to a trip to Europe and the Near East her family takes after leaving public life in 1876. I have no real complaints about this, since this recollection by a great woman behind a great man is never boring, and indeed her account of time among the sites and figures of 1870's Europe was a delight in itself, but I was surprised she chose to plot her memoir this way.<br /><br />I wish both Mrs. Grant and her memoir were better known in the 21st century and I hope this review in some small way might contribute to that.she chose to plot her memoir this way. <br /> <br />I wish both Mrs. Grant and her memoir were better known in the 21st century and I hope this review in some small way might contribute to that. <br /> <br />	2005-08-21

Of all the wonderful books written and illustrated by the great David Macaulay, this is my favorite. It was also the first of his books to which I was introduced. I was about seven and I read and re-read this book while pressing my face close to take in every feature of its lovely illustrations. I hope children in all times are as lucky as I was to meet a special book like this one and have it carry them off to a magical world between its covers.<br /><br />All that said, let me tell you something about Castle. Castle, like most of Macaulay's books, tells the story of all features in the building of a great work, in this case it is Aberwyvern, a forbidding castle King Edward I is constructing on the Welsh frontier. Macaulay leads us through the selection of the location for the fortress, the clearing of the earth, the setting of the foundation, and the building of its mighty walls and skyscraping towers. He introduces us to the masons and laborers, soldiers and nobles who will live and work at Aberwyvern. And just when the castle is done, Macaulay shows us a Medieval seige in all its brutal depth, as the native Welsh fiercely battle the invading English and seek to bring down their imposing castle.<br /><br />This book is truly one for the ages, and I cannot imagine anyone, small child through adult, would not love what they see here! I still have the copy I got when I was little and I get it down from the shelf to read at least a few times a year.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful and I hope it leads at least one person who might not have known about Castle to the library or bookseller to discover this special book!	2005-08-21

Albert Speer provides a singular embodiment of the enigma that is the German of his age. Speer was highly intelligent, utterly creative, imaginative, ambitious and above all civilized in a way only a genteel European of the early twentieth-century could have claimed to be. And yet this man of potential cast his loyalty to that most evil of modern states and aided it to the fullest of his ability. Speer is indeed a human puzzle. How did his life and the lives of eighty million of his fellow Germans go so astray?<br /><br />This book is certainly a must-read for anyone wishing a well-rounded education in the Second World War and the internal operation of the Nazi empire, because Speer was privy to top-secret meetings within the Nazi junta and relates with candor details of the plans and goals of his masters in Berlin. Albert Speer courageously, the facts show, confronted Hitler in his final days and refused to carry out the by-then demented dictator's plot to flood the subways of Berlin, an act which would have caused the deaths of thousands of civilians who had sought shelter there.<br /><br />Speer is also, sadly, for all his bravery and intellect, a liar, and for that reason it's wisest to tread lightly over some portions of this written history. We know of Speer's dishonesty more concretely today than ever before, owing to facts that have come to light in the two decades since his death---facts too complicated to go into for the purposes of this review. We know that Speer's claims of plotting an attempt on Hitler's life by infusing poison gas into the exhaust system of his bunker complex, was in all likelihood an unmitigated fabrication. Given this, how much else may we trust in Speer's account? I suspect we may go so far as to trust Albert Speer in his recollections that do not contain himself in a pivotal role. By that I mean, the aged Speer, near life's end, veteran of a twenty-year prison sentence in Spandau, probably found it irresistible to exonerate his own actions and make himself an heroic agent in opposition to Hitler. For that reason, this document of the goings-on inside Nazi Germany, only rates four stars instead of the five it might have gotten.s to trust Albert Speer in his recollections that do not contain himself in a pivotal role.

In fact, Sajer even tells us that although there is no way the unintiated could possibly comprehend the horror and agony of his and his comrades' experiences, he wishes we would read this book in as uncomfortable a position as possible, to enhance that much more the impact of the terrible words we are seeing.<br /><br />War is one of life's few true obscentities, and its greatest. Of all the wars ever fought, the eastern front of the 1940's is arguably the most horrrible. Sajer, as an impressionable seventeen-year-old high school student, voluntarily leaves behind his French father and German mother to take up a position as a supply truck operator on the eastern front. For the first year, this is his life, and while with its harsh winter and ever-present dangers from partisans it is bad, things become infinitely more horrible for young Guy Sajer when he enlists in an elite infantry unit, and is sent to the front lines during the time of Germany's retreat westward.<br /><br />Forget nationalism here. This is not a pro-German propaganda tool. This is a human voice speaking into the blackness of history and describing the evils of war as he knew them. When reading The Forgotten Soldier, I was moved sixty years after the events happened, by the lives and deaths of these young men who were all-but boys, as they struggled to stay alive and stay sane while confronted by the furious onslaught of modern war.	2005-08-21

Mcneal is writing in an ultra-realistic vein here and chooses, as so many writers have, to set his story against the canvas of a small town, in this case in the football-is-god state of Nebraska.<br /><br />We first meet Randall on the cusp of his teen years, as he and his parents and sister are just getting by financially, and while we sense all is not perfect, things in this early time are absolutely paradise compared to what comes after the grotesque death of Randall's father. Following the loss of the family patriarch, Randall's mother takes up with a sleazy figure who clearly has his attention on Randall's teenaged sister, a situation that leads to a shooting right on the eve of Randall's big date with the girl of his dreams, a sort of Mormon version of a Barbie doll. At the end of that same night, when Randall's life seems over and surely wrecked behind all hope, he undertakes what is either a suicide attempt or the most courageous act of flying into space and counting on destiny to save him that can be imagined. Fortunately for him, his life has not yet played out and Randall survives his desperate action.<br /><br />All this comes as mere prologue to the main story in Goodnight, Nebraska. Within days of facing down death, Randall, who has become an accomplished football player, is sent off from his native Utah to a rural Nebraska town, in order to get a second chance at life. There he succeeds at first in alienating nearly everyone around him, yet he is forgiven much because of his talents on the gridiron. He catches the notice of the prettiest girl in town, Marcy, and after surviving yet ANOTHER near-death experience, the story shifts forward a year and Marcy and Randall are unhappily married there in Goodnight, which is a place filled with colorful characters and off-beat happenings.<br /><br />I'll stop this meandering review here and say that what comes about in the final half of this fine piece of literature is a very sound story of self-forgiveness and healing, and of a much-challenged love overcoming cruel adversity.<br /><br />Tom Mcneal is a writer with a gift for storytelling and character development and I hope this first novel is a sign of good things to come from him.about in the final half of this fine piece of literature is a very sound story of self-forgiveness and healing, and of a much-challenged love overcoming cruel adversity.

Danny Sugerman knew Morrison and the other Doors, when he worked at Los Angeles' Electra Records in the late 1960's. Sugerman obviously idolized the Lizard King and wrote this book as much as a tribute to his late friend and mentor as a straightforward biography and story of an influential band.<br /><br />The three separate sections of this book \\"The Bow Is Drawn\\" \\"The Arrow Flies\\" and \\"The Arrow Falls\\" tell, respectively, of the youth and rise of Jim Morrison, the height of his fame as frontman for The Doors from 1967-1971, and finally Morrison's implosion after a half-decade of alcohol and drug abuse, personal neglect and probable psychological illness. The Morrison of No One Here Gets Out Alive is not a flesh and blood human being, but rather the shamanistic figure he clearly was to adolescent Sugerman. As evidence of this, consider once you've read it, how little space is devoted to details of Morrison's death.<br /><br />This was the first and in some ways both the best and worst book about Jim Morrison. If it does not cover every aspect of his twenty-seven year life with total insight and candor, then it does at least expiate this by giving us a first-hand look at the rise and fall of one of the legends of twentieth-century music. After reading No One Here Gets Out Alive, you'll come away knowing most of what you probably wanted to know about Morrison, and your time will not be wasted. True, some of the darker aspects of the man's character are left out in this exercise in admiration, but I think Sugerman does a good job of getting the \\"flavor\\" of the late '60's right, and placing Morrison into it as a person who helped shape the mood and turmoil of that decade in time.<br /><br />No One Here Gets Out Alive isn't quite the classic today it seemed poised to become when it was first released a generation back, but I think its cult status is assured.	2005-08-21

We are the heirs to the world they won for us through their courage and often incredible personal sacrifices, and there is probably no adeqaute reward that we could bestow on the ten-million plus heroes in the US alone, who authored for us all the sixty-plus glorious years we've enjoyed. I think Brokaw intended this book not only as a thank you to the ever-dwindling ranks of the WWII generation, but in writing about this sampling of veterans, he wanted to show how modesty and humility was common to so many. Because it is a shared trait in the generation that came into adulthood in the 1940's not to \\"make a big deal of things\\" we who were born later have sometimes found it shamefully easy to forget the ordeal through which they lived. I'm glad a book like this came along in time for the remaining veterans of the 1941-1945 war in Europe and the Pacific to get recognition and have a few of their stories told. What this books does is lets us see what this uncomplaining, self-reliant generation overcame to create the world we live in during the 21st century. Is The Greatest Generation a perfect read that achieves everything it aims to accomplish? No, of course not. But it does contain the twin virtues of being interesting and laudable at the same time, and I'm glad Brokaw and those who worked with him on The Greatest Generation produced this long-overdue work.<br /><br />Further, I hope it finds its way into more than a few classrooms as reading material.	2005-08-21

If no one's coming to claim it, it must not be very good, I thought. One day, when I was bored, I picked it up and read it out by the pool, and you know, contrary to my expectations that this wouldn't be my sort of book, it was pretty darn good.<br /><br />Actor Larry Hagman is a cool guy. He's funny, surprisingly spiritual and deep, and boy has he ever lived one amazing life. In this memoir, he talks about growing up in Texas, son of a good old boy rancher and the famous actress Mary Martin, then discusses his assorted misadventures in the years before he first found fame playing Major Nelson opposite Barbara Eden  on the '60's sitcom I Dream Of Jeannie. Hagman went on in the '70's and '80's to play the iconic bad guy J.R. Ewing on the massively popular prime time soap opera Dallas, and fans of that series will especially delight in his behind the scenes tales of the making of that drama. In among his wisecracks and jaw-dropping stories, and especially anecdotes of his trademark elaborate practical jokes, Hagman also strikes into his serious side when he waxes philosophically about death and dying, and is brutally frank about the lessons he painfully learned from his own brush with oblivion following his liver transplant in the 1990's.<br /><br />Before I read this short, fast-paced autobiography, I had little idea who Larry Hagman was, but for fans of his or the series he helped make famous, this is a treasure trove of facts and tall tales. Like I said, it's a pretty funny book.	2005-08-21

This one company of soldiers was present in nearly every major engagement of the European theater from D-Day forward, and, via incredible circumstances, was even the first group to reach Hitler's private lodgings, the fabled Eagle's Nest in the Bavarian Alps. These were men from all corners of our nation and all walks of life, who rose to extraordinary challenges and were heroes for all time.<br /><br />In Band of Brothers, unforgettable men stand taller than the figures of fiction.

I suspect those who loathe this work, particularly feminists, have never read it. I also suspect some who claim they've read it, simply have not, or they would not be so quick to cite its admittedly frequent depictions of violence as its main theme. For those of us who have passed through this metaphor-heavy validation of the shallowness created by limitless riches, we know what we have is a novel that is often very funny, very disturbing, and most of all, original throughout.<br /><br />American Psycho is brimming with lists of music, clothing, foods, clubs, all tying it inextricably to a time and place: the latter-days of Ronald Reagan's America. Its central character, Patrick Bateman, is the suave, handsome, twenty-something scion of a family of New York billionaires. He is materialistic beyond perhaps any character ever presented in literature, more vain than ever a woman could stand accused of being, and if we are to take him at his word--and perhaps we shouldn't--he is also a sociopathic maniac.<br /><br />As I'm sure many have stated, this novel is not hamstrung by a linear path. It could easily be read back to front or in any random order and the storyline would change surprisingly little. We read along through a year and a half in Bateman's privileged life, as he attends only the most fashionable nightclubs and parties, endures a fianc&eacute;e, Evelyn, so shallow even Patrick yearns for more mental acuity from a partner, and in the course of this existence spent among the tip-top of New York elite, we stand as spectators while Patrick dispatches one hapless victim after another. In one case it is a business rival of whom he is jealous. In another it is a fast food delivery worker. In several cases Patrick's victims are prostitutes or past sexual conquests. One thing that stuck out to me was that if one tallies a body count, Bateman in this novel murders as many men as women, somewhat nullifying feminist claims that this is a sexist, misogynistic assault on female dignity. I didn't feel maligned by the fact this fictional preppy was doing away with female victims as well as men. But then again, I doubt many of the critics of this macabre and surprisingly funny book bothered to read it.<br /><br />I liked American Psycho, and I was a trifle amused that I unexpectedly did. Is it for everyone? Not on your life! But for the majority of literate, relatively sane adults, this is a book that's well worth reading.uck out to me was that if one tallies a body count, Bateman in this novel murders as many men as women, somewhat nullifying feminist claims that this is a sexist, misogynistic assault on female dignity.

Not only were their lives usually a mess but everyone around them, even their parents, were as lost as they were. Where do you go when any friend or relative you might turn to for help is suffering too and has nothing to offer you in terms of a way out? These poor souls had youth, beauty, glamour and even money, and yet they were all confused, miserable and shallow, and unlike most of us, they did not even have the dream that maybe their lives would be better if they only had more money to make things right. No, they, with one very glaring exception, had all the money anyone could ask for, and yet it wasn't their ticket to happiness anymore than it was their stairway to personal salvation.<br /><br />Naive I know, but reading Less Than Zero for the first time as a high school sophomore in the mid-nineties made me wonder if the eighties in southern California were really like that. When I re-read this short, fast-paced novel in one evening about a month ago, I had no doubt whatsoever that for many late-teens and early-twenty-somethings this story was no fantasy but a report from the front lines of lost youth.<br /><br />In my opinion, this book will become a classic (moreso than it already has) and will be a work of literature turned to in fifty years when someone wants to read about the 1980's. With its many pop cultural references already seeming confusingly dated to those of us too young to have firm memories of those times, I think this work is right now in that transition period between \\"dated\\" and \\"historically nostalgic\\". Someday it will come out in annotated edition and enrich the experience of this book for a new generation of readers.<br /><br />Not my favorite Ellis novel, but a good place to begin.storically nostalgic\\".

Is total confusion a valid plotline? At first I thought I was hugely missing something in the plot of this book. \\"Maybe it's just me,\\" thought I, \\"someone too uncool to get writing this deep.\\" Then later I understood that this was exactly what the author intended. He wanted, I think, to toss scenes at us, characters at us, confusion at us, and mix us up amid random goings-on to the point where we read on for the sheer hope of there being a life-preserver floating further on in this terrible, terrible exercise in pointless prose. There is a mind-numbing parade of mentions of celebrities of the 1990's here and some minor asides into the lives of supermodels, and yes, at least two or three acts of cruel and pointless terrorism, but it's not ethical for an author to write a (what was it, about 500 pages?) book this size with so little in it. I didn't find this work, by the author of American Psycho, funny, enlightening, charming, witty, rewardingly satirical, or in any way interesting.

The most potent little three-letter word ever invented.<br /><br />What do I take away from Eleanor Herman's Sex With Kings, 500 Years of Adultery, Power, Rivalry, and Revenge? Most surprisingly this: The average king was not very good in bed. The average royal mistress was less a great beauty than a good conversationalist. Of the two, it was the mistress who more often than not proved by far the more interesting figure.<br /><br />When I started Sex With Kings, I was highly impressed with Eleanor Herman's well-researched work, but by the mid-point, I was vaguely bored. How can sex, the subject supposedly to end all subjects, ever get boring? Well, for starters, through no fault of her own, Ms. Herman ran out of subject matter. By the tenth reference to Charles II's mistress, Lady Castlemaine, or Louis XV's arch-mistress Madame de Pompadour, I was crying out for some new material. By the twentieth mention of the pair (I do not exaggerate, dear friends) my attention was drifting toward dust motes swirl in front of the TV set. Granted, these two ladies I cited by name were figures of interest and the exception among royal mistresses in that we know a relatively lot about them in this otherwise mostly secretive business, but eventually I was wanting them to exit stage left in favor of lurid details on someone else's bedroom life. Heck, even a good round of tabloid-esque gossip on Charles and Camilla might've hit the spot. So it was that by page two-hundred, I was reading on via sheer determination alone to get this book finished.<br /><br />Please don't interpret this as a denunciation of Ms. Herman's powers as an author. I found her prose wonderfully deft, her turns of phrase magnificent, and her historical research (and candor) phenomenal. She also had the rare gift of delivering history with humor, yet never drifted into silliness, as so often happens. What I wish was, she either had somehow been presented with a broader subject to work with, or had been able to make this a slightly smaller book. I look forward to her next book, which I will certainly buy, as I did this one. I hope it comes off as a little less padded and more fleshed out than this work was.story with humor, yet never drifted into silliness, as so often happens.

Don't buy into that! This terrible waste of perfectly good blank paper is nothing more than Ellis indulging his love for his own ego, and accomplishing two things at once: turning out another book after being off the literary scene for nearly a decade, and getting himself talked about once again, this time by making his main character, more or less, himself.<br /><br />Ellis can write. Rules of Attraction and American Psycho prove that. And that's why I have so little patience with this man who wasted my time back in college when I read Glamorama, and now did it again with this cliche-ridden goes-nowhere commercial for his own past books. This story about a writer (Ellis himself) and his miserable life with his estranged son, dead father, unhappy ex-lovers and pursued college girls is, I kid you not, a really, really bad read right down to its apparently possessed stuffed animal and annoyingly under-utilized re-visit from Patrick Bateman.<br /><br />No, Bret, the good times I had reading the novels you wrote that I actually liked will not get me to give you one more star on this piece of junk, not even out of sympathy. You can do way better than this. Please do.	2005-08-19

Six years later, the CIA convinces a lame duck President in his final hours in office, to pardon Backman in a complicated plot to flush out enemies of the US who were involved years earlier in the incomplete transaction for which Backman was incarcerated. Backman goes in one single night from inmate to semi-free man, and is transported to Italy, where the CIA makes him think he is being taught to blend into a new, secret life. The truth of course, as we know but Backman does not, is that the CIA wants him as a decoy to draw foreign agents to destroy him.<br /><br />The friend who recommended this novel to me has a track record for recommending some fine works. (You know who you are, Hugh.) The first forty pages of The Broker were so exciting and addictively inviting I didn't doubt he'd sent yet another fine read my way.<br /><br />But then....something bad happened. John Grisham forgot all about the plot I described above and mired himself, his primary character, and most of all his readers, in a sometimes charming but eventually tedious assortment of scenes set in Italian eateries.  I kept waiting for something significant to arise from these endless meals but nothing ever did. The plot does revive a little in the last fifty pages, but with nothing like the force it had at the start. Before I was done with The Broker I felt like someone had switched books on me and exchanged my thrilling political novel with a tour guide of the best cafes of northern Italy. Which is a shame, cause Grisham started off with the kind of edge-of-your-seat story that doesn't come along very often.	2005-08-19
103261:US	12598621	R2V0VQGQ23IC9Y	1400042267	59870239	Lost in the Forest	Books	4	28	28	N	N	Warped, Compelling Coming Of Age Tale	First, this confession: it was the beautiful cover of this book that first caught my eye. If ever a book was served by what lies on its cover, it is this one.<br /><br />Set in the California wine country in the late 1980's, this Sue Miller novel begins in straightforward fashion with the accidental death of a man, then lets the effects of that death cascade downward to set the entire story in motion. This novel tells of fifteen-year-old Daisy and her extended family, and how the life of Daisy and her relatives is changed with the loss of Daisy's stepfather. Ill-healed wounds from the recent past are split open once more amid a plethora of present-day anguish. Daisy and all around her are, to state it simply, changed.<br /><br />If Lost In The Forest were merely this, it would be an entirely different type of novel, but as most everyone now knows, Miller turns it into something more. What she accomplishes via Daisy's eventual erotic affair with a man nearly forty years her elder, is to explicitly turn out the most daring, taboo-breaking work of fiction since Lolita half a century ago. I avidly followed along behind Daisy in her descent into what is probably best described, even in 2005, as a plummet from grace.<br /><br />I really feel uncomfortable saying more than this, because there is much lying under the surface of this work and I am afraid of giving details away when you can gain so much more by discovering this story for yourself. What I will conclude with here is that Miller, in this tale of pain and reaction, coming of age, and the making of mistakes, has given us her best work since Family Pictures, and showed not only courage in the story she created, but in making this barely more than a novella, when so many other writers might have yielded to the temptation to bloat this by an unnecessary couple hundred extra pages.	2005-08-19

Brands' book Lone Star Nation presents an interesting and informative reading experience concerning Texas in the years before and after the war that provided that republic with its independence. Brands seems to take the stance that history is primarily made by the individuals who are living it, so it is the people he concentrates on moreso than the outward events. I liked this book and am glad a Texan friend recommended it to me in 2004.<br /><br />The only point of criticism I might have with Lone Star Nation and H.W. Brands is that he (as I saw it in my most humble of opinions) presented as unquestioned fact the authenticity of the controversial document some claim to be the diary of Mexican officer Jose Enrique de la Pena. While Brands is more than permitted to be of the opinion that the diary is authentic, I think he was faintly remiss in his duty as an historian by not mentioning the fact that a great many others regard the diary as a forgery or hoax, rather than a first-hand account of the aftermath of the siege of the Alamo. However, this is merely one point of difference and it in no way detracted from my enjoyment of this fine book.<br /><br />To all history buffs: get this book and read it, you'll be happy you did.	2005-08-19

This is a man who, alone and unaccompanied by a support team, set off across Siberia: Russia's \\"Wild Wild East.\\" Where thousands may dream of such a trip to a strange land, understandably few would dare undertake it. Tayler did.<br /><br />Siberian Dawn is full of descriptions that generate mental images of a vast, frozen land of natural beauty and interesting people. It is also a frank revelation of how the Soviet Empire spent half a century abusing its Asian ecosystem and mistreating the often semi-captive inhabitants there. As Tayler tells, there are polluted stretches of Siberia that are literally deadly for anyone living nearby, and hazardous for anyone passing through. Toxic waste dumps litter the virginal forests and parts of the fragile taiga are chemical stews that emit unnatural glows into the night sky.<br /><br />The Siberia Tayler's readers will discover is also home to a hardy and pragmatic population who by and large welcomed this stranger into their lives and imparted onto him the stories of their day-to-day existences in what is both a bleak and magnificent corner of the globe.<br /><br />What I found funny was how few Siberians Tayler met realized at first that he was an American: he was mistaken for a man from the Baltic. Even in the era of a supposedly progressive and open Russia, old ways sometimes lingered on in an undead fashion, and at times Tayler was treated with suspicion and even confronted by old line Stalinist authorities, puzzled and threatened by the presence of this inquisitive visitor to their homeland.<br /><br />I have always had an interest in Russia, both the place of past history and the nation of modern times, and Siberian Dawn proved informative and enjoyable.	2005-08-19

Revised: 11-06.<br /><br />Actually forget almost everything I wrote down there. We now know Heather Mills probably made her entire life story up. Might her autobiography be more honest if it began with a preface that said, \\"Why I am a gold digger...\\"?<br /><br />For posterity, here is what I said in 2005 about \\"A Single Step\\" back before I found out what Heather truly is:<br /><br />Heather Mills McCartney comes through these pages as a delightfully tough, caring woman, who has endured more in her still-young lifetime than any human should have to bear. I read along glued to each page as she took me from her difficult childhood in a working class home, through an adolescence that included homelessness and brushes with the law, up through the horrific motorcycle accident in which she lost her leg. After following her through of all of that, I was delighted when her story took its upswing and she met and later married the great love of her life, Paul McCartney. I felt like cheering for Heather! Good karma had come home to roost at last!<br /><br />Something I also admire about this remarkable woman is that she does not use the space of this (auto)biography as an exercise in vanity, she makes full use of her newfound place in the public eye to campaign for such worthy causes as a global ban on land mines, and also to inform about the evils of international child labor, which forces Third World children as young as three into cruel employment in sweat shops and agicultural concerns. I see in Heather Mills McCartney not just a fine woman I now admire very much, but the makings of one of the great humanitarians of our time.<br /><br />(11-06: Wow, was I ever wrong!)	2005-08-18

Not one bad story here and several that rank among the best in modern literature.

The title story has a woman, now old, telling of the brutal and inexplicable murder of her two best friends, red-headed eleven-year-old twin girls in the 1930's, on a blistering summer day, by a theretofore gentle retarded boy who worked at the local ice house. The twenty-four other tales in this collection prove equally gripping and contain an impact in ways longer prose, even epic novels, often do not. I read this anthology over the course of about a week, and spread the tales out so I was reading several in the course of each day. In my opinion this is not a good starting place for someone new to Oates' work, but it is beyond a doubt her best short story collection of the 1990's and one of her five best anthologies overall.	2005-08-18

His frequently twisted works were delicious studies in irony, and none moreso than in this collection. In a culture bereft of appreciation for subtle, intelligent illustrations, Gorey has thus far had no heir or replacement, and we are the worse for it.<br /><br />Gorey's illustrations (probably best not to term these \\"cartoons\\") fly in the face of modern American knee-jerk reactions to the comic strips found in the daily papers. With those we react as programmed, with a laugh. While reading Amphigorey we might on occasion break out with a grim chuckle, and more frequently with a smile, but just as often the reader will pause to ponder what she sees and invest the action on the page with a past to explain what set in motion the odd event we behold before us in two dimensions. Being compelled to use our brain because of what we see in an illustration is a refreshingly rare event in life, though common when one reads Gorey. His depictions of Edwardian and Victorian peoples and their misfortunes, all commited to paper awash in tones of varying gray and stark black, are visual feasts for the centers of our minds that deep down delight in the disturbed, deranged, and even the offensive.<br /><br />When one reads this collection of Gorey's output, the most overpowering feeling is that while what one is seeing may not be \\"nice\\" it is certainly a thing of grim magnificence.	2005-08-18

In the man's family mansion, in a room locked from the inside, his cousin has been found near death and her infant son dead, covered with small bite marks. People begin to say the rather creepy Baroque \\"demon-cherubs\\" lining the walls as decoration came alive and attacked the couple. Did they? Can logic overcome superstition? Just what IS the answer?<br /><br />Hint: it's gruesome stuff.<br /><br />The next story is about the serial killing of several local factory girls. A Jewish accountant is blamed and the detective seeks to show it is really the flamboyant oldest son of a prominent local family who is doing it. It is a race against time since the locals want to lynch the Jewish man, held under light guard at the town jail.<br /><br />The last story, set half a lifetime after the opening novella, features one of the beautiful female cousins in the first tale, who is found tied to a chair while her husband, an Episcopalian rector, is lying in front of her beaten to death on the rectory floor, with small paper hearts scattered all over his body.<br /><br />Kinda grim, eh?<br /><br />For lovers of authentic gothic fiction--not its pale modern descendant--the time spent reading Mysteries of Winterthurn will be time cherished. I recommend it without reservations. But fair warning, it is not for the faint of heart, or those whose attention spans cannot handle the demands of expertly measured prose.	2005-08-18

The first novella carried, in my opinion, the weaker second, but both are good reads. The first story was later shot as an NC17 movie. It is about a biologist who comes back to England after a decade in Brazil and begins to write his great work on the civilization of ants. He falls in love with the daughter of his host family and marries her. For several years all seems well, if slightly askew, somehow, to him, and at the end of the novella, we learn exactly what is wrong with life in that house and what has been wrong all along. (Slightly shocking, really, giving the unsuspecting tone to the plot that led up to it.) The second novella is about the late-Victorian mania with s&eacute;ances and spiritualism. In it a woman whose husband, captain of a whaling ship, is presumed drowned at sea, and she is encouraged by her sister to seek the aid of a noted medium. Both these novellas may easily be partaken of in a day, and make superb reading material for a long flight or rainy evening spent alone.	2005-08-18

She ran away from her widowed mother's care one day following school, after spending the last few months going from well-behaved honor student to a disturbed delinquent.

There were Germans in Cincinnati as early as 1796, but they came here in huge numbers in the 1840's and through hard work and honesty, changed this river city forever. This book, part travelogue, part local history 1788 to the 1960's, is an area classic. There is much about your own neighborhood you aren't aware of, and after reading Mr. Perry's lighthearted prose tour, you'll know more. From Bucktown (about where The Great American Ballpark is now) the \\"murder capital of America\\" in the 1870's, to the Courthouse Riots of 1883, the floods of 1913 and 1937, the building of the first concrete skyscraper and founding of the first Jewish college in America, to the disdainful arrival of Charles Dickens, the history of this stolid old city has never been so funny or so likable.	2005-08-18

It ruined Pete Rose in my eyes, not because of what others have said about him, but because of what Rose said about himself. My grandpa was a huge fan of Pete Rose and once took me to meet him at Riverfront Stadium when I was around six. About the only thing I'm glad for with this book is it didn't come out in my grandpa's lifetime.<br /><br />We all make mistakes. We're only human and that's what humans do: we screw up. Sometimes badly. I wish Pete Rose was in the Hall of Fame. I wish he was coaching the Reds today. I wish most of all he'd never placed a single bet on baseball. But as for Pete, like I said up there, he still doesn't get it, and I doubt he ever will.<br /><br />This book was a disappointment for many reasons. It did give me a nice look at Pete's career with the Cincinati Reds and took me back to my grandfather's tales of how great the Big Red Machine of the 1970's was, but what was lacking in these 322 pages was contrition, and I think that was supposed to be what this book was about.<br /><br />The Pete Rose I met in My Prison Without Bars, was a likable fellow, but underneath his trip down memory lane was a sort of combative, \\"this is somebody else's fault\\" attitude that put me off and I'm sure put a lot of others off, too. Rose admits at last that he in fact bet on baseball during the 1980's, a fact that surprised virtually no one, but instead of presenting an apology, or even a straightforward confession, Rose comes across as a bitter man, still trying to squirm away from his wrongdoing. He blames everyone from his friends and business associates, to Major League baseball (for not forgiving his gambling addiction as it did the drug and alcohol addicitons of other players). Rather than presenting the public with his mea culpa, Charlie Hustle, the greatest baseball player of his era, left me feeling negative toward him, and thinking he is a slightly unintelligent crook. Those were not images I had of the man before I started this book and I'm sorry that's how I felt when I was done.<br /><br />If I could say something to the man whose life is the subject of this work, I'd tell him: Pete, you've led an interesting sixty-plus years. You're one of the greats and a hometown hero for what you did on the field. You deserve to be in Cooperstown. But your attempt to make amends with this book---probably your last chance, sadly--is a dismal failure and a backset. I remember well the night you passed Ty Cobb's all-time hitting record.

No other author but this reigning genius of American letters, Joyce Carol Oates, would ever take on a first-person tale about a twenty-something serial killer, and do it non-judgmentally and with such dispassioned prose. We see events as the main character does. Disgusted as we are by him, we also come to like him in a strange way and care about him. We don't want him to be caught, and we begin to be sucked into his outlook about his deeds. We are set inside his motivations and only when we step back do we see the horror of his world and all he is doing. A brilliant book that sickens and fascinates at the same time.	2005-08-18

In the middle of this century, time travel is a reality. A graduate student from Oxford is chosen for an assignment to go back to the same city of the 1320's and report her experiences there. The thing is, through a blunder, she is sent to Oxford in 1347, just as the Black Death arrives. This story makes a 650 year-old event seem as tragic as if it occurred in the present, and puts faces and names on the victims of the worst pandemic in recorded history. It is well-written, fast-paced, imaginative and impacting. I've never known anyone not to think well of this book.	2005-08-18

Slavery and daily life in pre-Civil War times as it surely must have been. Telling his life story as he spends his final days in a Virginia prison waiting to be hanged, Nat Turner reveals to us his secrets and the nature of his mission from God, to free the black race and punish the sins of the white man. Because its violence is kept contained until one final moment at the book's end, it seemed more shocking and visceral to me than tales of mega-death and mayhem so common in other books that chronicle bloodshed and uprising. This novel was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and it earned it.	2005-08-18

This story follows a man from his conviction for an undisclosed murder, thorough his last days in a Paris prison cell, to his final moments before the guillotine. We are never told about the murder the protagonist committed, except he refers to it in a way that hints it was a spontaneous and regretted act of sudden violence against a man who genuinely wronged him, perhaps in a business dealing that left the main character financially wrecked. The man tells us of his childhood and reveals tiny, often tender moments from his life. We like him and wish he was not to die. He is a good man, a sort of everyman, and the feeling I had and I think all who read this might have, is that executing him is an injustice and a tragedy. In reading this I felt every second the man went through during his incarceration and ruin.	2005-08-18

A once tranquil Catholic family of six children is slowly undermined when the second son is born autistic. This is a story of people trying to cope and grab a share of normality while faced with a challenge that imposes abnormality onto them. The father, a psychologist, becomes increasingly distant from his wife and children; the mother, once the very model of a charismatic homemaker of the middle century, becomes a case study in smothering overprotectiveness; the oldest son feels neglected and rebels so deeply he leaves Harvard and goes to Vietnam; the main character, one of the middle daughters, spirals into drugs and a countercultural lifestyle. No one in this tale of creeping disintegration is left alone by life, or comes out unscathed.	2005-08-18

Forget what you hear on the evening news, read this book and approach Iranian culture with an open mind. I think you'll be startled, as I was, at much of what you learn. If the culture of Iran at the time of the Islamic uprising of 1979 was justifiably viewed by Americans as shocking, then it was also certainly fascinating in all its depth. This book takes us inside Iran from the point of view of a number of its citizens, as the pro-western nation in which they'd grown up retreats 1300 years in an effort to save itself from what it views as destruction from the outside. It is too easy to characterize Islamic fundamentalists as unintelligent and backward, but let us make no mistake, many who take that stance are shrewd, brilliant, and above all proudly commited to their way of life. In The Mantle of the Prophet, the reader will meet many of these.<br /><br />This book gives descriptions of all areas of life under the Ayatollahs, from the law courts, to the marketplaces, the army, to the mosques themselves, and introduces us to real people who lived through those frightening times. This book is as important today in the age of nuclear proliferation as it was when first published in 1985. Anyone who wants to learn about life inside fundamentalist Iran would do no better than to add The Mantle of the Prophet to her reading list.	2005-08-18

While one work, even a small one, will breathe, and spring to life, another simply won't. In its flatness, The Music of the Spheres is, sadly, the latter type of novel. I don't know what would have changed this. Certainly Elizabeth Redfern put an obvious amount of time and effort into her tale of madness, political intrigue, murder and astronomy, all set in a 1790's England similar in its heightened state of alert to America in our own time. And yet...despite what I'm sure were her best efforts, I could not like these characters or care what became of them.<br /><br />I purchased a paperback copy of this book at a dollar store, and when finished, it did not find its way onto my shelf, I donated it to a thrift store. I didn't feel sentimental fondness for it, and I did not enjoy reading it. At the end of the novel, I felt cheated of the time I put into it, and that's a rare experience for a lover of books, like me.	2005-08-18

She finds herself stuck between her much-older husband and the plots for revenge of the bitter teenage son the man relentlessly persecutes.

Before there was radio, before there were movies, before TV, there were the great British music halls, called \\"Empires\\" with their Vaudevillian comedies and light drama. In this novel by the English writer J.B.

Beginning in 1913 and for the most part concluding at the start of WWI a year and a half later, this story brings a by-gone era back to life and shows us how actors and actresses of the pre-film era lived, worked, and in a few memorable cases in this book, how they died as well.	2005-08-18

There's no way my review could do justice to the majestic goings-on inside this multi-faceted book, so I won't try. It's amazing. I will say that much. This trilogy is scary, uplifting, and adventurous, all at once. It won numerous awards for its author, Conrad Richter, and deserved every single one. Why this classic is so little know today, half a century after its publication I do not know, but hope that someday future readers rediscover it and give it its due.	2005-08-18

First off, this novel comes across as more \\"New Agey\\" than any of the other 3-4 in the series I've read. It comes close to being about magic and psychic visions rather than about history and anthropology. I didn't like that. Its cardinal sin, in my eyes, was the underuse of the presence of Cahokia, the greatest city in pre-eighteenth-century America. Barely a description is given of this metropolis beyond brief mentions of its walls and \\"the great mound\\". Had a chapter or two been put in detailing the might and glory of Cahokia, or had this become  a novel about Cahokian culture itself, then this book might truly have earned five-stars.<br /><br />Would I have read it if I knew then that it would be a story about a little girl's vision quests as a weapon against (apparently god-created) drought in the mid-Mississippi basin? Probably....but it does let me down that what could have been a tale of Cahokia the Great, was misused as a tree-hugging fable about the management of the earth, and the inner strength of the apparent weakest members of society.<br /><br />Maybe someday the Gears or another author will do justice to Cahokia and write a good novel about it at its height. I hope so.	2005-08-18

Hill House, with its history of one tragedy after another, is described by Mrs. Jackson as \\"insane\\". Even its angles and corners do not meet right. Its floors are infinitesimally off balance, making a sense of subconscious unease come upon anyone who enters. When a parapsychologist assembles a team to spend a few days in Hill House, no one foresees what is to come. Do not look for boogy men here, the menace is much less obvious than that. This is horror for the sensitive and intelligent reader. PS Unlike Ghost Story, feel free to see the original (not the 1990's remake) of the film version of this book.	2005-08-18

Along the way, this man, a pacifist, invents the electric chair in response to the cruelty of hanging, sees one daughter kidnapped by a black-clad man who descends from the sky in a black hot air balloon, only to take the girl off to become the most celebrated medium in New York City; has his oldest daughter escape a sure-to-be unhappy marriage on her wedding morning and go west to begin living life as a hired gun; witnesses his most beautiful daughter go to the stage, gain fame and rape Mark Twain; and sees his most eccentric daughter secretly become the finest inventor alive at that time.

In tone, in subject-matter and in meaning, the last ten pages of Seek My Face stand apart from the novel that came before them. It was almost as if the ever-reliable Mr. Updike took the main character from the novel, wrote her into a short story that concerned her childhood, and then placed the short piece into the longer prose offering, separate but unequal. The tender \\"memory\\" of the main character as a child in a long-gone America of the early twentieth-century, interacting with her endearing Quaker grandfather, was more touching than the tale of the character's having lived thru the highs and lows of the twentieth-century American art scene. I HAD to mention that. The story at the end, the woman's memory, meant more to me as a reader than everything else in the novel, a work I at times enjoyed a lot and at other times found myself bored with nearly past tolerance.<br /><br />I'm a fan of John Updike. I've read most of his short stories and a half-dozen of his novels. But if I knew going into this book what I know now for having been from one side of it to the other, I'd read just the ending. But hey, if you're someone with an interest in the history and figures of American art from the 1940's to the 1970's, you'll probably get more out of Seek My Face, than I did.	2005-08-18

Rarer still are the books that haunt you for a lifetime. If You Could See Me Now is, for me, one such book.<br /><br />I was first given a copy of this short, rapid-paced genre novel in high school by a friend who has since passed away. He was heading back up to college at the time and putting some of his books in storage for the year and when he came across this one, he said to me, \\"Read this, Ellie, but don't let it screw with your mind.\\" I thought he was kidding around; a book screw with MY mind? Ha, as if, right? But, no, this book is dark. And it got to me in a way many others simply could not have done. The tragedies at its core, loss and the effect of that loss on the central character, represent probably the deepest of the negative themes out there in literature, as well as in life. In this book, Mr. Straub does a great job of holding down a sense of mystery-via-confusion and we alternate between wondering about the odd events in the present of the novel (set in rural Wisconsin in the summer of 1975) and the abrupt end to the more straightforward description (set in the same place in 1955) at the start of the work. Some have said they saw the revelation coming at about the 2/3 point of the novel but I didn't and I remember I stopped in mid-sentence and felt stunned. And sad. Very sad. I recall thinking: I didn't want it to be that way...<br /><br />See, okay, granted this wavering novel of unequal merit is a genre story penned by a man most known for his ghost stories, but until it makes up its mind what direction it wants to go, this works as an extremely engrossing study of the behavior of an inexplicably neurotic and haunted main character. The characterizations,and the emotions these characters feel, are as realistically cast as those of any men and women from \\"serious\\" literature.<br /><br />This book holds meaning to me for the personal history I touched-on at the start of this review, but it is also a book with a story that deserves more readers than it's had, being overshadowed as it is by some of Straub's later, more well-received works, such as Ghost Story and his collaborations with Stephen King. I gave it four stars instead of five for several reasons, the most glaring of which is the annoying ending Straub imposes after the contortions of plot that kept me rapt through the first two-thirds of the story. Trailing after the gloomy depression this psycholgical study left in me when I read it a dozen years ago, was a feeling of accute frustration that this novel I cared about was ended in the way it was. I was ticked off and I'm guessing you will be, too. Still, my advice, if you want to spend a week reading a dark tale of obsessive youthful love gone very wrong, read this. With apologies to Peter Straub, forget the superficial elements of horror that come late in this psychological mystery and concentrate on the first 200 pages. This book works as a carefuly unfolded story of love, loss, and grief. If he had left it as that in its final third, If You Could See Me Now would go down as his masterpiece instead of a mild letdown.of this review, but it is also a book with a story that deserves more readers than it's had, being overshadowed as it is by some of Straub's later, more well-received works, such as Ghost Story and his collaborations with Stephen King.

Miss Santmyer's story of an Ohio town full of memorable characters and their journey across the decades from immediately after the Civil War, thru the time of the New Deal, was so detailed and extensive it truly contained the feeling of vicariously experiencing the progress of a life of eighty-plus years' duration.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel for its respectful but never sentimental 'warts and all' depiction of small-town life, for its sweep across history, and--being an Ohioan--for the delight of seeing mention of local places I personally knew. But above all else it is the magic of prematurely coming to know a little of how it must feel to live a lengthy and varied life, that makes And Ladies Of The Club the truly fabulous work of art that it is.	2005-08-18

I also nearly put it back on the shelf once I had it down. Why? Well, from the cover description, Mr. Nicholls' work sounds like yet another self-indulging shuffle back in time to when the author was young. Let's face it, too many writers go back to their youth and create a pseudo-memoir of how they wish it had been. I expected that's what this was.<br /><br />But guess what? I was WAY off the mark and am so glad I didn't go with my first impression. A Question of Attraction is an engrossing, funny, witty (NOT the same thing as funny) tale of Brian Jackson, a likable and problem-prone young Englishman from the year 1985. We tag along as he wades through the standard agonies of late adolescent growing pains and look on at his adjustments to an inundation of rapid changes to his life. His working-class past has not always been happy, but Brian emerges from it a relatively optimistic, if self-deprecating, figure and we quickly root for this charming underdog as he starts university with two major goals. Brian's first goal is to be a contestant on a collegiate quiz show favored by his late father; his second and more all-consuming hope, is he wants to gain the love of Alice Harbinson, a leftist, petite-bourgeoisie princess who is also a first-year student at Brian's college. Even while we want things to work out for Brian Jackson, we cringe on his behalf as he pursues the beautiful, flighty Alice, a girl surely he, like we, know is unattainable for a young man of his status (read social class) and personal aptitude.<br /><br />That's the backbone of the novel's plot, but in among its 300-odd pages, we trek along on some endearing misadaventures and cheer for Brian Jackson, wince for him, and want to console him more than a few times, even as we laugh for--or is it AT--him and his sincere efforts to make it on his very uphill climb.<br /><br />I highly recommend A Question of Attraction to anyone who wants to be touched by a fun, light read about beginning college life, while taking a trip back to the era of Thatcher's Britain of the mid-1980's.<br /><br />Cheers!recommend A Question of Attraction to anyone who wants to be touched by a fun, light read about beginning college life, while taking a trip back to the era of Thatcher's Britain of the mid-1980's. <br /> <br />Cheers!	2005-08-17
