This time I knew what to expect and once I started the book I couldn't put it down. The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove is a delightfully demented retelling of Pete's Dragon with a style of humor that rivals Terry Pratchett. <br /> <br />Moore's books are especially funny to me because there is a Pine Cove, California and while it's not where Moore has located it, he's captured the town's many small town quirks perfectly. Then he throws a supernatural event into the mix and sits back to watch the story unfold.	2005-08-27

Stevens's unexpected opportunity to travel gives him the time to rethink his life as a buttler, coming to the conclusion that he was probably not the great buttler he thought himself as. Much of the book is spent reexamining his relationship with Miss Kenton with whom he had a numerous differences of opinion. It's also a study at class, ethnicity and culture, specifically the encroachment of outsiders (neuveau riche Americans) on the well ordered English lifestyle.	2005-08-24

I'm calling it post-modern because it takes place in the 1930s (contemporary for when it was published), fifteen years after Arizona state hood, so it has all the modern trappings (telephones, cars, etc.) but is still basically a western in that it deals a working ranch and the struggle over the land with a sheriff who is torn between upholding the law and protecting his cattle rustling sons. <br /> <br />Kyne fleshed out Mary Sutherland far better than I expected. She has a smart head for business, can handle a horse and is fluent in Spanish, all amazing accomplishments for the more typical 1930s heroine. The conflict and history of Hamilton and his son is where the book really captured my attention and interest.	2005-08-24

Are these previously published photos or worst case scenario pictures that he cooked up for the sake of this book? Sure as another kid of the 1970s, I do remember places that used some of these decorating gaffes but I'd still like to know if this is a very funny annotated non fiction or an equally funny parody. <br /> <br />Now some specific comments: <br /> <br />page 8: my step father used to have a suit just like that red one. I think mom finally convinced him not to wear it about mid 1986. <br /> <br />page 12: anyone who reads Country Living magazine will see that the room pictured is still a popular faux country look. I guess some things just don't go away as quickly as they probably should. <br /> <br />page 14: We have two bedrooms currently painted in two of the colors shown here. One is the bright green (top right square). The other is yellow (bottom right). Why am I admiting this? <br /> <br />page 47: I think I saw a room just like this in a recent issue of Florida Design.

In modernizing the time of the story for the film, new technologies come into play making Bourne's flight through Europe almost impossible because he can be tracked via cell phone signals, satelite imagry, email and the internet. In the book's diegesis, the year is 1980 (there abouts) and there are none of these modern devices, allowing Bourne and his female companion more time to plan and to act. I also prefer Maria in the book because she actually has useful skills. In the film she is just there as a convenient ride away from the initial confrontation and later hangs onto Bourne out of Stockholm syndrome. It was refreshing to see her have useful skills and a more robust personality than she does in the film.	2005-08-24

While Rugged Water is entertaining it is more of a romance than a mystery. There are mysterious circumstances but nothing as well defined as an unexplained death or an obvious murder. In this case, the trappings of mysteries are used to dress a romance. Here the question is: will Cal stick with Myra or will he win Norma's heart?

The book is clearly based on a real father/son relationship as the book is dedicated: \\"For Peter, Max, and Zachary--I.A.\\" probably on the author's husband's relationship with presumably their sons. The story gives the impression that dad isn't around much and the son clearly craves time with him. Mom it's implied isn't much for imagination as the son's first thought at seeing dad there to wake him up is that the day will be spent prentending. I find this unspoken tug-of-war between the parents and their parenting styles rather troubling.	2005-06-17

Lincoln books, it takes time to get used to how he writes the regional dialect. The story then takes off, describing the classic tale of young love springing from a pair of long feuding families and how that love affects old enemies. <br /> <br />Fans of Bleak House might enjoy this book as it clearly takes inspiration from that Dicken's classic. There is the decades old law suit, the family secrets, the young woman sent to live with her guardian, etc. The Big Mogul though takes these story elements and puts them into 1880s Massachusetts culture.	2005-05-03

It is an old mansion, home of John Jarndyce and his three wards: Ester, Ada and Ricard. It is also the squalid conditions of Tom's-All-Alone. It is the bleak out come of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce. It is the Victorian shame of an illegimate child. There are many bleak houses in this book.<br /><br />Bleak House carries a warning against the excesses of nuisance suits and the danger of a laisez-faire government which it wraps up in a delightful albeit complex and dense comedic romance of a young woman supposedly orphaned and sent to live with her guardian who is stuck in a generations long lawsuit over an estate. Interestingly, I recently read an American story that obviously borrowed heavily from Bleak House. To anyone who enjoys Bleak House, I recommend The Big Mogul by Joseph C. Lincoln.	2005-05-03

To my slight surprise many of his books were turned into films. Probably his best known adaptation is Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (recently remade as just Mr. Deeds). I also learned that Kelland is Harlan Ellison's favorite author and he has a rant on his website bemoaning that no one reads Kelland's books anymore or even remembers him. <br /> <br />This particular book was in fact made into a film, also called \\"The Cat's-Paw\\" and it starred Harold Lloyd in 1934. Harold Lloyd playing a rather serious character who grew up in China (but is not Chinese)? From the description on IMDB, it sounds like the book was turned from a cautionary tale against government and business corruption to a full-out screwball comedy romance. Yes, there is a romantic element to the book (all Kelland books contain a romantic boy-meets-girl thread) but in Cat's-Paw, this romance is muted and down-played. If I ever come across a copy of the film I'll have to rent it just to see how it was bastardized. <br /> <br />Another important theme which was probably tossed out for the film was that of prejudice. The main character, though American by birth, is culturally Chinese having spent his entire life in China. He speaks Chinese (Catonese), he respects the Chinese leaders and philosophers (and quotes them frequently). He is always respectful to the Chinese imigrants living in Middlesex (much to the bemusement of the other characters) and rebukes his friends who do not show the same respect. From the movie poster on IMDB, I think all of this was tossed out.	2005-04-20

One part of it tries to tell events straight up as they happened. Another part tries to track the pieces of her life Wilder left out of her \\"Little House\\" series. The final part tries to bring in the television series which deviated from both versions of Wilder's life in some significant ways. Personally I wish the biography (especially the cover art) were left out the television series as it's the weakest part of the book.	2005-03-25

It does have moments where it dwells too long in setting up the events but fortunately those moments are not the majority of the book. The Gunpower Plot / Guy Fawkes day is not something taught in U.S. schools (or if it is, it's glossed over) so I came to this book note knowing much and came away having learned a great deal.

It's a much better book, though still heavily flawed, if the chapters with the flash backs are skipped. The flashbacks are written out of chracter for Zelazny's usual style of writing so I can only guess that they are Thomas T. Thomas's contribution to this book. The story itself isn't much different than the second half of the Amber series, namely that of Merle and his semi-sentient computer. Zelazny usually doesn't bother with a lot of back story and in his better pieces, Tom Gurgen would have known by about page 30 that he was somehow tied to Loki. He'd have his powers and be trying to figure out why he had them, who wanted them and who he should aly himself with. But here the pacing is off and all the really typical (and good) Zelazny stuff doesn't happen until the last thirty pages of the book!	2004-11-11

The crossword discussion and examples were fascinating and educational. I've learned a great deal on the art of solving the cryptic variety of crosswords. By the end of the book my chances of solving these clues had gone from none to slim. The deciding factor now is a matter of culture.

I've done my best to read Word Freak, having heard great things about this memoir of the Scrabble championships but so far I just can't get past my dislike of the narrator. He interupts the flow of the book to either brag about his education (he has a degree in journalism) and yet he revels in his ignorance of words when the other better Scrabble players most often not only know if a set of tiles makes a word but what that word means. The author seems satisfied with only memorizing the word minus the definition because if the word were important he'd already know it. He does after all have a journalism degree.

Inside Out claims to be a memoir of the blacklist and while the blacklist, HUAC and McCarthy trials are mentioned, it's mostly just a meandering autobiography. Bernstein needs an editor to shorten and break up these chapters to keep things more on topic. The first chapter is by far the best at covering the blacklist era and shows how it turned the film and television industry \\"inside out.\\" The second and third chapters go back in time, covering in all of his childhood in one and all of World War Two in another. They also strive to build an explanation of why Bernstein chose to join the American Communist party but instead of presenting a well-thought and erudite discussion of third party politics, socialism and communism, he weakens his overall memoir with long winded, rambling tangents.	2004-11-11

Like thie Hitchhiker to the Galaxy series Moore keeps his scenes short and he jumps from place to place rather than following one character.  <br /> <br />There's also the added bonus to anyone who knows California of his perfect description of the Big Sur tourist trap communities. The city that he's describing is probably actually Cambria (at least it fits the description in terms of local and personality), I couldn't help but also think of the real Pine Cove (also in California but south east of Riverside).  <br /> <br />As this book was published originally in 1992 there are pieces of the book that are clearly dated, namely the WWI vets still being somewhat plausible and two the pre internet chat rooms. In that regard, this book reminded me of the Sue Grafton mysteries (if Santa Teressa were being rampaged by a hungry demon).	2004-10-25

Why did Peters let this series become the Ramses Adventure serial? The end of chapter 11 made me put the book down for a good half hour of eewing. I don't want to know about Ramses love life. I'd rather he be seen and not heard. He's never been a well written or likeable character but had fortunately been nicely toned down for most of this book. I just wish that Peters had resisted the urge to write those \\"document H\\" fragments. The series is written from Amelia's POV and it should remain that way. Nothing is accomplished from those smoochies with Daria unless to spawn a \\"son of Ramses\\" book in the future. I shudder at the thought. <br /> <br />So for the good bits version -- the tongue and cheek jabs at the state of Egyptology in the early 20th centure were delightful to read. I've noticed in recent Egyptology books/movies (ever since Stargate) that Budge has gone from demigod to pariah and this book takes the pariah stance. I really must find a biography of him to make up my own mind. <br /> <br />Then there's the extreme silliness of Sethos -- another character that I'm not sure the series needs but I tolerate him. He's sort of there to poke fun at the dastardly villains of books from the turn of the 20th century. He's just there for the \\"Scooby Doo\\" ending although it would be fun to just once have a different villain.	2004-09-21

Fisher does a good job of letting her characters age and mature although all of them remain somewhat troubled. I found Surrender the Pink an intriguing follow up to Bachelor Girl, a cultural history of the single working woman. Dinah, the protagonist, is a classic example of the conflicted single gal. She loves her job, likes sleeping alone and yet wants to married and maybe have a baby. She toys with trying to get back together with an ex but ultimately comes to her senses. The book, save for the tacked on epilogue, ends with Dinah deciding to stay single. The epilogue choses to save her from spinsterhood, although I'm not sure I like her choice of man. With the epilogue in place, I am reminded of the film Something's Got to Give and I'm thinking of the daughter in the film as being akin to Dinah.	2004-09-13

I enjoyed the book thoroughly but I'm left wanting greater closure. The resolution as it is leaves the protagonist knowing more than the reader thus ending in a state of suspense. Calcutta Chromosone will probably be one of those books torn apart and analysed in numerous literature classes. It unfolds its story by theme not by chronology. The path to discovery is perilous and only open to the chosen few. The Calcutta Chromone is about the journey on that path, not about the discovery itself.	2004-09-09

Dan/Don/Danny/Diane et al is not much different than Dave Lister. I enjoyed the book quite a bit, though I have to wonder if the author retconned some of Dan's early stock picks. The original book was published in 1973, so unless the author has a time belt of his own or is psychic, he wouldn't have known about Apple and Sony. I'd love to get a first edition and compare those passages... The time travel plot and \\"twists\\" are fairly standard, the ending didn't suprise me but I did enjoy this telling of the story. The journal entries from the various incarnations allowed for a character growth that doesn't usually happen in this genre of book.

The first story, \\"The Red Cottage\\" nearly gave me nightmares. Interestingly, some of the descriptions Wakefield uses for his ghosts show up in another ghost story I'm reading, Affinity and I'm enjoying the synchronicity between these two books. The introduction to the story collection says that Wakfield was a contemporary with Lovecraft and it shows in his stories, in the subtle way he turns the oridinary into the extroridinary and ultimately into the horrific. I find that his shorter stories pack more of an emotional punch than his longer ones. His best stories are the ones that stay under twenty pages. The longer ones lose their pacing. He doesn't throw in enough smaller scares in to compell rapid page turning. Nonetheless, stay with the longer stories and enjoy the endings. They all do satisfy at their conclusions.	2004-08-27

I was hoping to enjoy these stories as much as I had enjoyed Accordian Crimes but after a while the stories all started to sound the same to me. She seems to delight in taking a small moment in time (the six seconds to ride a bull at a rodeo) and expand that moment of time out with lots of internal monologue and flash back. While these techniques can be great tools for character development she just doesn't manage much of that in these stories leaving all the stories to bleed together like one disjointed stream of conciousness account of Wyoming.	2004-08-27

I think part of that apparent dryness is a result of it being the inspiration for so many spy thrillers. It is impressive to see a book published in 1915 still in print -- so many books don't have this long of a life in print. All the comedic bits that make it a memorable Hitchcock film aren't there. Even as a young filmmaker he was already exercising his authority as an up and coming auteur.	2004-08-12

While I appreciate that Drury was probably trying to show their awe and reverence for the various nobility and royalty, the extra words spent on groveling and self deprecation turns simple thoughts and plot progressions into multiple page passages of wasted words. The book is much smoother if the servant scenes are skipped all together.	2004-08-09

While the painting on the first edition is well executed it has NOTHING to do with the story. The new cover art is closer to correct, though I would have loved to see the little calico standing in front of the ornately carved blue door rather than inside the tool shed. I guess the door would have been quite difficult to do justice.<br />I also have to admit that once I was about 1/3 through this book, I realized and remembered that I had read this book when it had first come out (but had forgotten much of the plot). I can recall reading it for the first time in a salon on State Street as a freshman at UCSB. I remember thinking it would be cool to have a calico cat (I now do). And I remember being annoyed by the cover art.<br />One piece that confused me about the story is the timing of the events. Only until the last chapter and the epilogue is the story given a timeline of 1957 being the &quot;present&quot; but the way San Francisco and Marin are described, pieces of the story feel like they should be taking place either now (late 1990s when the book was written or 2000s if the present was meant to be the near future). Other events make the book seem like it should be taking place in the 1920s or 1930s. I think the biggest sticking point is the mention of an earthquake being strong enough to kill some characters in the back story. San Francisco is known for two big quakes: 1906 and 1989. Of course it turns out that the earthquake in question is completely fictional but I think it would have been better if the timeline could have been wrapped around an actual quake or the city in qusetion moved to a place not so known for two quakes. In other words, I found the odd details distracting at times that I just wanted the plot to take where it wanted to go. <br />The author though excels at two pieces of this book: her understanding of cats and her ability to describe paintings. It helps that she is an accompished artist in her own right. When she was describing Braden's series of portraits fo Melissa I could see them so clearly! When she was describing the little calico cat, I felt as if she were in the room with me.	2004-07-16

As there are only a couple dozen real life accounts of what it is like to work as an operator, the book is rather anecdotal. In tone and approach the book is similar to Nickel and Dimed but is more academic. At just under 130 pages, there isn't much room for deep analysis.

One the one hand I've seen many adaptations of the book on TV and film. Some credit the book others don't. Having just recently seen the UK series &quot;Survivors&quot; (1975) I must say that I'm surprised that Terry Nation didn't credit Wyndham given the heavily lifted plot and dialogue! Sure, the main characters are changed around but the incidental plot elements are nearly the same and in the same order. All that is missing is the triffids and the comet.<br />Which brings me to my main complaint about the book: The triffids hardly have anything to do with the plot of the book even though they are the title of it and are the most thought out piece of the book. The idea of a tech industry expirament let loose in the wild was fascinating but save for chapter 2, nothing is further is developed along those lines.<br />Then there's the comet (if it is one) which blinds everyone and then the unexplained plague a few days later. Now if you believe the B film Day of the Comet, the comet turns those who saw it into zombies -- triffids be damned and then the same sort of plot (minus menacing plants) goes on. In this book though, the two seem unrelated except to kill off all those annoying recently rendered blind folks.	2004-07-16

This book falls into the trap of using plot summary to pad an otherwise shallow and poorly thought out book. The writing style waffles between flippant and unneccessarily reverent for Roddenberry. The Ethics of Star Trek would be a much stronger book if it approached the series in terms of the times they were made. Does the Orignal Series reflect the ethic debates of the late 1960s? Why did post cold war 1990s produce a series as dark as Deep Space Nine and what sorts of cultures and ethical questions are represented by the B'Jorans, Cardassians and the Dominion? How are these ethical questions brought to the screen? How does film editing, writing, music, etc. work to build up the ethical theses? How do these same elements work against the theses?<br />None of these topics are covered. Instead there are simplistic retellings of the classic foundations of ethics and logic. The chapter on the Cave, for instance, is laughable. <br />I am now just waiting to hear back from the person after me for an address. Then I'll get this book back into the mail.	2004-07-16

Some readers may find it difficult because of its use of language (...). Others may find it difficult just for it's odd prose. The chapters are not linear nor are obvious segues ever used to cue the reader in that a jump in time has taken place. There are also lots of characters with similar names making it easy to lose track of who has done what, when.

The time he takes in each chapter to pat himself on the back drags down an otherwise interesting, if unrealistic, study of human space travel to Mars. All his assumptions leave little to no margin of error. Recent events have shown that accidents do happen to either expensive and/or tragic results. We're not yet to the point emotionally, economically or politically where we can be as cavalier as Zubrin's plan requires.<br />On writing style, Zubrin manages to take an interesting subject and turn it into something dry and tedious to read. The pieces where he actually sticks to the science of Mars and of space travel, it's a quick and interesting read with informative graphics but these bits are hidden amongst long passages of minutiae relevant only to Zubrin.	2004-07-16

Whereas Wyndham may now be best remembered for his novel Day of the Triffids clearly his strenghth as a story teller lay in the short story rather than the novel. These stories, the longest of which is thirty pages, each of which starts on the notion of &quot;what if...&quot; are delightfully entertaining, thrilling or disturbing depending on the tone of the particular story. <br />CHRONOCLASM: It's the story of a man faced with sudden knowledge of the immediate and distant future and his willing participation (for good and bad) to see the future play out as it has been described to him. Though the threat of a temporal paradox is presented, the story ends up playing out as if paradoxes cannot come into being leaving the reader to ponder if man really has as much free will as he thinks he does.<br />TIME TO REST: <BR>This is one of three stories themed around Mars. Here the Martians are native humanoids, tall, graceful and cultured. The main character is an expatriot Earthman living the sort of life one of Hemingway's characters would have lived if he had written science fiction. It's really just a lovely mood piece.<br />METEOR:<BR>Meteor plays on the notions of perception and assumption as it follows the disasterous attempt of a slow ship to colonize a far away world.<br />SURVIVAL:<BR>Survival is the closest these stories get to pure horror. It has all of the classic themes of man's inhumanity to man and monster within that is released when one's existence is threatened. It is the second story that features Mars but here Mars is an unattainable goal.<br />PAWLEY'S PEEPHOLES:<BR>This story is another time travel piece but is much more lighthearted than Chronoclasm. What would happen if people from the future decided to turn the past into one giant theme park? How would the citizens of the past react?<br />OPPOSITE NUMBER<BR>Here's another take on time travel. This story works around the idea of different futures arising from different outcomes to decisions. Can true love sort things out when fates goes horribly pear shaped?<br />PILLAR TO POST<BR>Wyndham's writing here reminded me most of H.G. Wells's social comentary science fiction, espcially that of The Time Machine. Here a man gets a brief chance to live in the future when he is mistakenly transmitted into a distant future. Although the future society is no Eutopia it is better than his life in the past. How hard will he fight to keep his future life and do they really want him in the future?<br />DUMB MARTIAN<BR>If the woman in this story weren't a Martian (and I think she was a human but of a multi-generation Martian lineage), the story would just be a cautionary tale against domestic abuse.<br />COMPASSION CIRCUIT<BR>There are a couple classic Twilight Zone episodes that are similar to this story of man and machine and man becoming machine. It's not particularly unique or clever but still chilling.<br />WILD FLOWER<BR>The last story of the group is by far the weakest. The book ends on a whimper. Just sing Where Have All the Flowers Gone and leave it at that.	2004-06-20

I found the authors travels more interesting than her descriptions of eating or cooking. Much of her cooking tales personally turned my stomach. I suppose I'm glad that I'm not familar with her New York Times reviews. The recipes included in the book were either bizarre sounding or rather simplistic. Save for the soufflet recipe, I'm really not tempted to try any of them.<br />It took until page 54 for me to really get into the book. I had five abortive attempts at starting the book before I finally got to a point where I was interested enough to keep reading. It was at the point that she went to the boarding school that I wanted to continue. Again it was for the traveling and not the food.<br />To top things off I had the joy of reading this book while traveling for the holidays. My mother-in-law and mother both did things that reminded me of Ruth's mother. In the case of latter, it was to see if years old preserves that no longer had the consitency of preserves were still etible. For the former, it was to cook a meat dish that smelled okay but was gray in color. She also then made a strange vegetable dish that had all sorts of things mixed together that just don't seem like they should go together. Both dishes actually tasted fine but they sure looked strange! Perhaps if I hadn't been reading Tender at the Bone at the time I wouldn't have been so put off by them. In the case of the preserves, my mother in law came to her senses before actually eating any.	2004-06-20

I like the original artwork better and let me explain why... When the Stainless Steel Rat Gets Drafted was published I was lucky enough to get a job in my school's library in the back room where books were prepared for library use or repaired. This book was one of my first that I bound in the plastic dust covers. While carefully putting on the cover I had to read the blurb on the inside of the paper jacket. How could I resist a cover with such an impishly cute main character? The blurb made me want to read the book and so I read the first chapter in between working on other books. I knew I couldn't get away with hording the book so I bought a copy for myself (in paper back). I've since been lucky enough to find a hard back first addition so I'm registering my paperback copy. <br />Since this book introduced me to the Stainless Steel Rat series and to Harry Harrison as an author, it's still my favorite of all his books.	2004-06-20

Daphne du Maurier's prose carries so many important details woven together that every paragraph must be savored. Her books are not ones to speed read. As with My Cousin Rachel, the title character is created out of the other characters recollections of her, her possessions and her history.

The book is divided into themes for chapters. There are chapters on what it's like to be in space, how much better the human eye is than the camera, how basic human needs are taken care of in space (and what is done with the waste), etc. The writing is a little choppy, cutting between eras as needed for the thread of the theme, rather than smoothly segueing through eras or different missions to space.

This section unfortunately relies too heavily on descriptions of all sorts of sexual acts. I'm not sure if I should laugh or be insulted. The two books take the plot on an unexpected tangent. Just as things seem to be petering out (excuse the pun), it picks up speed with the same frantic pace of some Stephen King novels.

I think it's supposed to be taking place during the mid to late 1980s when there was an influx of Japanese business ventures in the United States -- especially in California. I remember the xenophobic response from some people of my parents age and especially of people my grandparents age (not everyone, of course). As a teenager, I was surprised, confused and later embarrassed by the reactions of my relatives.<br />Rising Sun is clearly playing into those sentiments and frankly I don't like it.

I'm slightly ticked at her backhanded comments about what it must be like to work and live in California. I'm a Caucasian native born Californian who has worked more minimum wage jobs when I was younger than she did for her book. Not all the low paying jobs are taken up by latinos or people who speak accented English. The minimum wage scale runs the full gammut of folks in California. <br />OK -- enough about my California rant. Of the three states she visited (and come on, 3 of out 50 is hardly a good sample size to draw conclusions about all of the United States), I enjoyed the Maine chapter best. It didn't get hung up on her preconceived notions of race/ethnicity and instead focused more on the money issues that anyone working minimum wage has to face. <br />The best part of the book though, has to be the footnotes and bibliography. I think I've found titles to a good half dozen or so books that I would like to read as follow up to this book.<br />I think this book would have been stronger if she had backed up her own experience with interviews from the people she worked with or even interviews with people in similar positions. She could have had short half page to maybe 2 page max. vinettes of other people's stories ala the Chicken Soup series to back up her experiences -- or even counter point them. One story from each state would have flushed out the book nicely.	2004-06-14

On the Road covers the same route (and more) but doesn't water down the regional flavors with allegory. Instead American from New York to California and all parts in between is shown for its good, bad, rich, poor, and various ethnicities with humor and honesty.<br />Through Sal's numerous transcontental road trips, Kerouac describes the regional beauty, kirks, culture and geography of every city and state the protagonist passes through. Of the cities I've either lived in or visited that are visited in this book I enjoyed the most--especially his numerous pilgrimages to San Francisco. His first entry into San Francisco is classic: &quot;Over the Oakland Bay Bridge I slept soundly for the first time since Denver; so that I was rudely jolted in the bus station at Market and Fourth... and there she was, Frisco - long, bleak streets with trolle wires all shrouded in fog and whiteness... . Weird bums (Mission and Third) asked me for dimes in the dawn...&quot; This opening paragraph to San Francisco is still apt, if not, perfect.<br />While the book is an icon of the Beat generation and Sal, the narrator, desires to be among that set, he's abmismal at it. Throughout the book he worships his friend Dean who is the wildly cool womanizing, debauched, drug addicted man Sal wants to be but Sal just can't manage to follow in Dean's footsteps. Whereas Dean will drive over 100 mph, steal cars and delight in getting drunk, Sal will either drive the speed limit or hide in the back when Dean is driving, try to return Dean's joy ridden cars, or want to sleep off the booze he's drunk when around Dean. It's Sal's valient attempts to be like Dean while being unable to follow through that add a delicious irony to the novel.<br />In the end Sal and Dean and the rest of the gang part ways,  having grown apart as they've matured over the course of the two years this book covers. The book ends on a somewhat sad note, looking back across the days of those crazy contiental trips with nostalgia and longing.	2004-06-14

The various women in the book are nicely flushed out as characters rather than being cookie cutter versions of the narrator.

Of course with the 2000s being into the 1970s retro look and sound, maybe what's old is new. <br />That's not to say it wasn't a quick and enjoyable read and Bil Keane's illustrations are humorous too.

Anita shares Kinsey's one main weakness too, namely, she's much too ignorant to have been doing her line of work for so long. Hamilton subjects Anita to moments of abject stupidity to force expository dialogue. I know that it's good to &quot;show&quot; rather than &quot;tell&quot; but there are times when a simple interior comment between narrator (Anita) and audience (reader) would suffice and strengthen the character and keep the plot moving. As it is, I sometimes had to wonder how the &quot;Executioner&quot; had stayed alive for as long as she apparently has. It's not like she has Buffy's slayer enhanced skills to keep her afloat while she learns.	2004-06-11

Jeffery Deaver creates a rich archectural landscape for his mystery rather than putting it in some vague cliched archetypal buildings or rooms. The blury red building with yellow lit window does not capture this richness of set and scene!<br />All through the book not one character nor one scene is wasted. It's an extremely tight and satisfying mystery. The last thread that is tied up as a coda is perhaps one that doesn't need to be addressed. One loose end would have giving the piece complete plausability but to explain the protagonist's motivation for being such a good samaritan is unnecessary and overwritten.	2004-06-11

The strongest and most interesting pieces of this novel are the forensic denistry bits. Although the details were gruesome, I was most captivated by the story when the main character was allowed to shine. The farther away from the dentistry the story gets, namely the al-Qae'da back story and the let's send the dentist and his ex-girl friend in to save the day are over written, cliched and sometimes downright hokey. This book's strongest and weakest points are one and the same: the events of September 11, 2001. The are some wonderful behind the scenes first hand knowledge that flush out the middle of the book but at the same time, the events are still so recent that the fictionalized bits stand out more than they would if the author had chosen to make up a completely fictional disaster. Perhaps in a few more years when the details have blurred more, this book will read better than it does now.	2004-06-11

The shark attacks and the investigations afterwards are the glue that hold this otherwise pulpy chick-lit-esque book together. Unfortunately the book strays from the shark for the middle of the book and there are some excrusiatingly boring chapters about dinner parties, thoughts about love affairs, etc. There's one chapter in particular where Mrs. Brody stops at every single restroom she can (about one per every five pages) to a) change her underwear, b) powder herself and c) put powder in her shoes.

One writing assignment we had in highschool was to write a story based on an object that we randomly chose out of a box. In the case of this novel, the Girl in Hyacinth blue is the object and in some regards, the protagonist. I love how the story unwinds itself back to its origins, to see just how it is that the painting arrived at its final owner. The theme of an objects life melds perfectly with the mission of Book Crossing. <br />On a side note, I found it fascinating that Ms Vreeland is still teaching creative writing. When I took her class back in 1990-1, her carreer as a writer had only just started. She had gotten &quot;What Loves Sees&quot; published and was working to get a second book published. It wasn't until joining Book Crossing that I learned that she had done well for herself as a writer. I'm very pleased that she has because she was one of the best teachers I ever had.	2004-06-11

The first and second time I was under the pressure of time and grades for high school and later college. As the book is short in length, both teachers only gave one or two days to read the book. At least for me, it's a dense book. The further into the story I get, the harder it is to read. It's as if the writing style mimics the growing darkness of the hinterland as Marlow gets closer to finding Kurtz. Kurtz, now, is, in my humble opinion, a let down. All through the book he's played up as this superhuman man who knows the wilds of Africa better than any one and is of such a character that he has devotees! Yet when he is finally found, he is but a husk of a man, insane from illness and is only in the story in person for a couple of pages.

Jeffrey Hammond reminds me of the inept detective from Lupin III and Beth, the main character waffles between being too perfect to being Pauline (as in &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;).

A better book in this genre is Day After Tomorrow. If I come across a copy I'll register it and release it.	2004-06-11

I've never heard of the author, his songs nor am I a devout person. Secondly, my mother probably has heard of the author, heard his songs and is a devout Christian. I will HAVE to get a copy of this book for her if she doesn't have one now.<br />So why did I find this book such a page turner when I came to it with nothing in common with the author? It's well written!<br />Ice Cream... has the sort of pop culture analysis that I was expecting (and didn't find) in The Ethics of Star Trek. Sprague takes the day to day experiences, including reading the comics, eating ice cream and watching The Andy Griffith Show to do an epistomological run down on how he has grown to be the person he is. <br />Unlike some books that are meant to be inspirational, Sprague does not preach. He's very upfront about what he believes and why he believes what he does but he does not fall into the trap of &quot;It's my way or the highway&quot; to true happiness, salvation or whatever. I respect him for his self restraint and respect for viewpoints contrary to his own.<br />In closing, read to the end of the book to the Appendices. There is a fantastic sounding ice cream recipe and a lovely lullaby by the author written for his daughter.	2004-06-11
634025:US	52489871	R1JIF1RC76NC6J	0679781587	823326041	Memoirs of a Geisha: A Novel	Books	5	0	4	N	N	Three Reviews in One	I just finished after some marathon reading sessions. I want to do this review in three parts because I'm rather split brained about this book.<br />Review #1: From start to finish I had this nagging feeling that I've read this book before -- or read a very similar story. I haven't been able to track down why this book seems so familiar. If I ever do, I'll append this journal entry. To some degree, then, this story feels derivative and cliche. Orphaned girl tries to make good with her new &quot;family&quot; and is harrassed by the jealous, spiteful bully. The story picks up at the 1/3 point and stops being quite so cliche as it is in the set up. The good news is that the details are so rich and the language flows smoothly enough to make this book a page turner, even in the rough start. <br />Review #2: I happened to be reading this book at the same time I was reading the Chobits manga series. Both books are about Japanese culture and the relationships of men and women across classes. <br />Memoirs of a Geisha is the fictional account of a girl aprenticing to become a geisha in the great depression era. As the book explains -- gei means art and geisha means artisan. It's an ironic/jaded pun for a society/class of expensive escorts. To stay a geisha, a woman cannot marry and should not fall in love with her clients. Chobits seems to be a sci-fi<BR>retelling of the same tale. The underlying tensions are about what sorts of pairings are good/normal and who should love whom. Chi is an artifice -- an almost pun on geisha.<br />In both cases, Chiyo/Sayuri (of Memoirs of a Geisha) and Chi (of Chobits), are seeking happiness, wondering if happiness can be attained. In Sayuri's case, her station is supposed to keep her dispassionate in her associations with her various clients. In Chi's case, she's a machine and not supposed to feel real emotions.<br />Review #3: The final comparision I found myself making with this book is between Chiyo /Sayuri and Chihiro/Sen (of Sen To Chihiro Kamikakushi aka Spirited Away). Both stories revolve around young girls who are taken away from their parents through bizare circumstances and brought into lives that they would otherwise not have lived. In Chihiro's case, she ultimately is returned to her parents as is warranted by the fantasy convention. Mother in Memoirs reminds me of Yubaba and Mameha reminds me of Lin in her initial reluctance to help and her later tutorilage.<br />Final thoughts: I think Memoirs of a Geisha has lots to offer. It may be a little rough at first but I recommend reading the book! You will come away enriched for reading it.	2004-06-11

The segues between his childhood, his investigation into the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission, his trip back to Mount Olive and the historical pieces about the Civil Rights movement in Mississippi are sometimes missing or confusing. I also caught a couple editorial mistakes (duplicate words or funny gramatical stuff) that should have been caught by the editor.<br />Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading the book and feel I am coming away from it having learned a great deal about a time and place in history I am personally quite removed from. I read it just after having heard the NPR All Things Considered 5 part piece on the Brown vs. Board of Education decission so Eubank's memoir provided an interesting counterpoint.	2004-06-10

Beyond being a faithful adaptation of the pilot of Deep Space Nine, it actually bothers to give good descriptions and character insights / motivations. My one suggestion is to start with chapter 2. Although the pilot does actually start 3 years in the past with the Borg attack, the first chapter stalls the rest of the story. There is enough referral to the backstory that the first chapter really isn't needed in the book. I dare you future readers to start the book with chapter 2.	2004-06-10

They live in a rustuic farmhouse, get to know their neighbours, live through various natural and unnatural disasters and the birth of thier daughter.<br />This is a unique view of Spain from an outsider but not a tourist, and an interesting meditation on consumerism, community, and lifestyle, all writter with humour and style. While not hiding the hardships, Stewart makes one want to abandon the city and strike out as a sheppard in a foreign country.	2004-06-07

The last third of the book as she came to the present (at the time of the writing) the book's pacing began to stall. The last three chapters diverge from the biography of her life and her balance between her beliefs and private vs. public lives and are instead essays on her beliefs. The problem I had with them, is I'm a skeptic. I think for someone who is genuinely interested in astrology, reincarnation and ESP will get more out of these final chapters than I did.	2004-06-06

I think that Tim Burton actually improved on the book by connecting those dots, developing themes and motifs that are started in the book but not explored. <br />Big Fish the movie has three distinct narratives. Narrative one is the son's interpretation of his father's stories. The fantasy scenes are the son's exaggeration of what his father is telling him. Then there is story of the father's last days before he dies and the son's attempts to understand his father. Finally (and this is Burton's largest contribution) is the meeting of the truth of the father's stories meeting with the son's expectations of that truth. This happens at the funneral -- a wonderful addition brings the two divergent stories together. <br />Things you won't find in the book: the carnival, the bank robbery, how the father met the two headed singer and the son's pregnant wife.	2004-05-24

I found it a quick read. It seems more modern than a book originally published in 1985. I had to remind myself that the references to Star Wars were to episodes 4, 5, and 6, not the more recent 1 and 2. LOL!<br />I think Duane was very proud of all the work she put into creating the whale wizard culture and writing the poems for the singing but honestly, it was almost over-kill. The practice sessions and preparation chapters could have been condensed with more emphasis put on the final show-down.<br />The book was good enough that I want to now read So You Want to Be a Wizard and High Wizardry.	2004-05-13

The last time I had read it, I had been ten or eleven, right in the middle of Nick and Carrie in ages. The first time I read it, Mr. Evens seemed meaner. Mrs. Gotobed's home seemed more magical and somehow over the years I misremembered it as being a light house. Why on earth there would be a lighthouse in the middle of a dale in Wales. <br />This time, I found myself relating more to the adults and to adult Carrie. Mr. Evens seemed sadder than mean.

This book was first published in 1975 but after the events of September 11, 2001, this book has new and eerie significance. <br />Nonetheless, I can't give this book a 10 because the story quickly becomes mired in backstories and character developments only vaguely related to the central plot. I ended up resorting to skipping chapters that didn't directly deal with the main consipirators. If the story had been edited down by about a third, I would have rated it a 5.	2004-05-13

I have a few complaints about the book. It bothers me that Clarke caved to the plot of the movie, 2001, and removed the whole bit about going to Saturn from Jupiter. It leaves his first book standing alone. Books and movies diverge all the time and he should have just stuck to his original storyline for the sequels. <br />My second complaint: what's up with the EPCOT retirement home?

I wished there were a class I could take so that someone could explain the darn thing to me. <br />That summer after seeing the film, I read the book. It explained a great deal. It works well with the movie as Clarke and Kubrick collaborated. I think 2001 is Kubrick's best film.<br />Flash forward about 3 years. I enrolled in college as a Film Studies Major. My very first class showed a film print in the correct aspect ratio of 2001. And we got a lecture about it (not my last one either). So, if ever a book/movie inspired me or shaped my life, it has to be this book.	2004-05-10

I thought it was a waste of time back then and still do but apparently lots of folks don't. The blue prints of the Nautilus feature in Clive Cussler's book Valhalla Rising. And there's an entire website devoted to blue prints and 3D models.<br />Closing thoughts: I much prefer the sequel to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

I was not expecting this book to be so rich in detail, context, theme and character development. On one level it's just a very descriptive outline of 5 days in the life of a luxury hotel in New Orleans in the early 1960s. Hotel also takes a critical stance in the civil rights issues of the era. Through carefully crafted characters, it comes out pro-desegregation but does it without wielding a heavy hand. Then at the individual characters and vignettes, the book is about karma and how little decissions can add up to either good things happening or extremely bad things happening.	2004-02-09

Not only did this book share my love of cats and interest in calicos but gave a clear and easy to understand explanation of calico genetics.	1998-12-07
