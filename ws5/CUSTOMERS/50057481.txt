It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

Edwards investigates Reagan's childhood, his leadership qualities and his accomplishments with keen insight and understanding.<br /><br />The narrative concentrates on those people, events and circumstances that shaped the great man's character and career path, from his childhood and student days through his movie career, his two stints as governor of California and his presidency.<br /><br />Both the failures and the great and enduring successes of the Reagan administration are covered. For example, Edwards looks at the Iran-Contra debacle as well as the economic miracle, the benefits of deregulation and the West's victory in the Cold War.<br /><br />A highlight of the book is Edwards' analyses of the four essential qualities of leadership that Reagan possessed: courage, justice, prudence and wisdom. The author points out how these qualities came into play at various occasions in Reagan's life and career.<br /><br />He discusses the books that helped persuade Reagan to change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican and in the bibliographical essay at the end, he reviews the best and the worst books on the 40th President. The Essential Ronald Reagan concludes with copious notes and a thorough index.<br /><br />I also recommend the books [[ASIN:0142001686 When Character Was King: A Story of Ronald Reagan]] by Peggy Noonan, [[ASIN:0684848236 Ronald Reagan: How an Ordinary Man Became an Extraordinary Leader]] by Dinesh D'Souza and [[ASIN:0789479923 Ronald Reagan: An American Hero]], with an introduction by William F Buckley. The CD set [[ASIN:0743500334 Speaking My Mind]], is a most inspiring collection of speeches and observations by the great man himself. God bless Ronald Reagan.	2005-10-13

The Final Solution includes the chapters Hitler's Pledge, Warnings And Forebodings, Britain's Dilemma, Evidence And Omissions, Rescue and Refuge, Eyewitness and This Bestial Policy. Part Two: Hope And Hopelessness includes Warsaw And Bermuda, The Spread Of Nazi Power and The German Occupation Of Hungary. Part Three: Auschwitz revealed, includes inter alia, Escape From Auschwitz, Zionism At Bay, The Deportations From Hungary, The End Of Auschwitz and the Epilogue.<br /><br />The book is painful to read as it chronicles the history of the Shoah from the earliest warnings of Hitler's intentions through the war, the doomed attempts of many individuals and organisations to rescue the Jews, the indifference and the excuses given by certain officials on the Allied side, and the actions, good and bad, of occupied and neutral countries. Although the book does not focus on personal experiences in the holocaust, there are some examples of unspeakable horror that the sensitive reader had best avoid.<br /><br />The author ascribes the extent of the tragedy and the failure to do more as failures of imagination, of response, of intelligence, co-ordination and of sympathy. To me the most shocking revelations are those where policymakers used the excuse that they were afraid of flooding Palestine and the UK with Jewish refugees. Or maybe even worse, those who claimed that the reports coming out of Europe were exaggerated. Another incredible show of indifference was the refusal of the Allies to bomb Auschwitz, while their planes were overflying the accursed place to drop supplies on Warsaw for the Polish uprising.<br /><br />Here and there one finds some glimpses of right action, for example Bulgaria, an Axis ally that nevertheless managed to protect its Jews from the worst. But overall, one is left with a feeling of utter despair at the way the events unfolded and the frustration that Zionist leaders must have endured in trying to help their doomed people. It is chilling to read how countries like Switzerland refused to accommodate refugees and how every obstacle was placed in the way of orphaned children trying to reach Israel. The world looked on and it still does. Since then, we have witnessed Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya and Darfur.<br /><br />The book contains 16 pages of black and white plates and 20 maps. It concludes with biographical notes and a thorough index. For more information and background on the horror and the indifference, I recommend [[ASIN:0060915331 A History of the Jews]] by Paul Johnson and [[ASIN:1859842291 The Contract of Mutual Indifference: Political Philosophy After the Holocaust]] by Norman Geras.

Interestingly, the word Iraq comes from the name of the Sumerian city state Uruk. There is now a village called Warka near the ruins of the ancient city.<br /><br />The introductory chapters explore the geographical setting, archaeological research and the paleo-, meso- and neolithic periods. Following on, the author discusses the Hassuna, Samarra, Halat, Ubaid, Uruk and Jemdat timeframes, and the ancient trade routes.<br /><br />Next up is the Sumerian civilization, with a study of its origin, religion, history and mythology. The story of Gilgamesh is covered here. There was a Semitic interlude and a final Sumerian renaissance before the torch of history passed to the Semites in the form of the Akkadians and later the Assyrians and Babylonians. The statesman and lawgiver Hammurabbi is thoroughly dealt with.<br /><br />But other peoples played a part too, like the Hurrians, Mitannians and Kassites. Insofar as they impacted upon the history of the area, empires like the Hittite and the Egyptian are also considered. There are detailed narratives on the Assyrian empire, the Chaldean kings and the fall of Nineveh and later of Babylon. After this event, Mesopotamia ceased to be a seat of empire and passed from the Persians to the Greeks, the Parthians, the Sassanids and ultimately to the Arabs.<br /><br />In the Epilogue, we learn of the heritage of this civilization, such as enduring religious symbols like the Maltese cross, the tree of life an the crescent. Some words have come down to us, like \\"alcohol\\" (guhlu in Akkadian), \\"myrrh\\" (murru) and \\"naphta\\" (naptu), \\"abyss\\" (abzu in Sumerian). Some Sumerian words still live in Hebrew, like Egal (great house) = Heikal = Temple and the personal name Eitan (Etana).<br /><br />The book contains plates with photographs and illustrations, and concludes with bibliographic notes, comparative history tables, various interesting maps and indices of names and subjects. For those interested in the paleolithic origins of civilization, I recommend Lost Civilizations Of The Stone Age by Richard Rudgley. If you have a taste for alternative history, the book Ramses II And His Time by Immanuel Velikovsky has much to say about Babylon and the Chaldeans. And finally, Empires Of The Word: A Language History Of The World by Nicholas Ostler, deals extensively with ancient Mesopotamia, its languages, culture and empires.ices of names and subjects.

Geras discusses a phenomenon that reveals mankind's remarkable ability to enjoy life while ignoring the suffering of others. He observes that the road to Auschwitz was built by hate but paved with indifference.<br /><br />The book becomes an investigation of the moral consequences of ignoring oppression and persecution. But it's not all abstract theory. What makes the work so readable is its compelling blend of historical analysis, human nature and philosophy. The author argues convincingly that the tragedy of the Shoah has not yet been adequately dealt with in the field of political theory.<br /><br />There is no denying the reality of the contract in the title of the book. In the past 15 years the world has witnessed atrocities of genocidal intent in Bosnia, Chechnya, Kosovo, Rwanda and Darfur, for example. In addition, there are ongoing crimes like the modern version of slavery, the practice of torture and child labour. There does seem to be reluctance to face up to evils like these, in political philosophy and in society as a whole.<br /><br />The picture that Geras gives us of the relation between perpetrator, victim and bystander is not a pretty one. He considers many angles of the phenomenon, including the human survival mechanism of blocking out unbearable thoughts. And its opposite also exists: the concept of a universal duty to help others beyond one's immediate friends and family. C S Lewis touches on this aspect of human nature in his classic Mere Christianity.<br /><br />The book does not fall into the trap of arguing for collectivism as a remedy for the contract of indifference. Very appropriately too, since the atomistic lifestyle is found as much in European welfare states as in capitalist economies. A case might indeed be made that the welfare state encourages atomism since it relieves the individual of personal responsibility towards others. Paying tax as substitute for charity.<br /><br />On the negative side, Geras assumes that everybody is burdened with unrestricted moral liability and if we indulge in the pleasures of life whilst ignoring brutality, we are all as morally culpable as the Europeans who ignored the plight of the Jews. The idea has merit, but there are different degrees of responsibility and culpability that are not properly identified or distinguished in the text.<br /><br />On the other hand, there does seem to be a widespread move towards nihilism globally (read Andr' Glucksmann), and hedonism & narcissism, especially in the West. The lack of real compassion for the suffering of others is often disguised with political correctness and blaming the scapegoats America and Israel for all the world's woes. This moral inversion is particularly prevalent amongst the entertainment and media elites.<br /><br />A thorough historical study is needed to compare the Left and isolationst Right's shrill reaction to the liberation of Iraq with their silence to e.g. the genocidal second Russian invasion of Chechnya, the madness of Mugabe in Zimbabwe and Kim in North Korea, and the horror in Darfur. Or their eerie denial of human rights abuses in many other third world countries.<br /><br />In his short essay on Leon Trotsky, the author claims that the revolutionary had an intuitive grasp of those emotions that are transformed into evil actions under certain social conditions and could thus predict the Shoah. But I get a different impression from Paul Johnson's great work A History Of The Jews.<br /><br />It was Trotsky who expelled the Jewish Bundists from the 1903 Russian Social Democrat Congress in London, with a zeal \\"close to hatred.\\" This was a direct cause of the Bolshevik triumph. He called Herzl \\"repulsive\\", ignored Jewish suffering and refused to see Jewish delegations when in power. Sounds like a bit of a Chomsky or a Finkelstein to me.<br /><br />Geras believes that certain obligations to help those who suffer ought to be enforced by law, but recognizes that such legal duties could only partly meet the requirements. He rules out any coercion that involves danger or self-sacrifice and points out that there are limits to the law. Of greater importance are pervasive norms of care that to the author seem to include the encouragement of such mutual support via taxation. But how can compassion be legislated?<br /><br />Mmm ... I think this has been tried in Western Europe. The result is a Post Christian continent where the Welfare State has replaced religion with its emphasis on personal responsibility. Not only has this rendered the culture defenceless against a growing threat in its midst but also had a disastrous influence on birth rates. European cultural elites have taken the concepts of The Other and multiculturalism to an extreme where Judeo-Christian roots are despised whilst oppressive and frankly disgusting elements of other cultures are ignored.<br /><br />There is indeed a minority of people who care deeply, but even these will go insane if they focus on worldwide atrocities all the time. Balance is needed, for any individual that concerns her- or himself with the suffering of others to the exclusion of all else, will soon be mentally exhausted and thus of no practical use to those in need of help. I think ultimately the only solution can be a spiritual one, when the heart of stone is turned into a heart of flesh.<br /><br />This most valuable and thought-provoking work draws on a deep well of Holocaust literature and encompasses reflections on psychology, literature and politics. I think to understand the problem addressed here in its wider context, one ought also to read (it is irrelevant that these 2 authors are found on the opposite side of the political spectrum from Geras) the following books: Our Culture, What's Left Of It by Theodore Dalrymple and The Dragons Of Expectation: Reality And Delusion In The Course Of History by Robert Conquest. And of course A Matter Of Principle: Humanitarian Arguments for War In Iraq, edited by Thomas Cushman, to which Geras is a contributor.be enforced by law, but recognizes that such legal duties could only partly meet the requirements.

This highly readable book takes one behind the media scenes and agendas of the conflict in the Holy Land. In a most engaging fashion, the author explains how journalism works in practice whilst exposing the gross bias against the Israeli side. She names the worst culprits, both individuals and organisations. The latter include the BBC, National Public Radio, The Guardian, The Independent, CNN, Associated Press and that old grey harlot, The New York Times.<br /><br />Using examples like the death of the 12 year old Palestinian boy Mohammed Ad-Dura, the gruesome lynching of two Israeli reservists in Ramallah and the so-called Jenin Massacre that was later debunked by a United Nations investigation, Gutmann provides plenty of detail on how the anti-Israel propagandists operate. Truth be told, some of the blame rests on the Israeli side where the media war was not handled correctly. For example, Israeli spokespeople have not always received adequate resources or been proficient enough in English. This situation is now being improved.<br /><br />One of the most glaring examples of media hypocrisy is the way in which Israel's security fence has been portrayed, with false analogies to the Berlin Wall. This while the EU intends to erect a barrier on its eastern borders and there are similar fences or walls between Turkey and Syria, and between Yemen and Saudi Arabia, to mention just a few. Gutmann reports that the situation is improving but I think much damage has already been done if one considers recent opinion polls conducted in several countries of Old Europe where alarming percentages of the population see Israel as the greatest threat to world peace.<br /><br />Then again, this might just be a resurgence of the old European Anti-Semitism now surfacing again under the guise of Anti-Zionism. In this regard, I refer the reader to Bat Ye'or's magisterial work Eurabia. There are also brave Arab reporters, like the Israeli citizen Khalid Abu Toameh of the Jerusalem Post. A whole chapter looks at his work, a refreshing example of objective journalism. Gutmann's revelations are indeed disturbing because not all news consumers are willing to think for themselves, let alone investigate other angles.<br /><br />It seems that the real roots of the Anti-Israel bias derive from Israel's victory in the 1967 war when the old Soviet propaganda apparatus started the demonization campaign. It gained further momentum during the First and Second Intifadas. Now Israel is routinely scapegoated by the leftist media and by dominant sectors in academia. This ideologically based bias has reached alarming proportions in Europe and only a few principled voices are reacting against it, like Oriana Fallaci in her books The Rage And The Pride, and The Force Of Reason.<br /><br />The Other War is a brilliantly researched book, full of verifiable facts and expert analyses, and at the same time a gripping read. Highly recommended for those who are interested in the Middle East conflict or who would like to get an inside look at how the media function.

The structures of the Stone Age were built by using a very precise unit of measurement, called the megalithic yard. The book explores the science behind prehistoric units, their mathematical origin and means of reproduction, and proves that these are linked to the dimensions of the solar system.<br /><br />The reader must have a basic knowledge of arithmetic but overall the book is an easy read and very revealing. Amongst the topics discussed are writing, Egypt, Sumeria, the Minoan foot, solar and sidereal days, pendulums and the importance of the planet Venus. It turns out that the British Pound and Pint are both derived from ancient measurements. The units of the hour, minute and second were developed more than 4000 years ago from the movements of the moon.<br /><br />The text also encompasses subjects like the harmony of the spheres, Sumerian degrees and the calendar, and explains that the metric system is not a recent invention. There is a section on Thomas Jefferson and his achievements; this great man apparently realized that he was rediscovering parts of a very ancient system.<br /><br />Amongst the most captivating sections is the chapter on music and light. There is a definite correspondence between the rotating mass of our planet and human music. Also, megalithic mathematics produces its own musical structure. The authors conclude that there must have been an advanced people that instructed the rest of the world in science and technology. They also refer to the Masonic concept of the Great Architect of the Universe.<br /><br />There are seven appendices that include further information on earth days and the megalithic year, megalithic music, the Phaistos Disc, the amazing barley seed, and the connection between megalithic principles and Freemasonry. The colour plates include approximately 20 full colour photographs and there are many black and white illustrations throughout the text.

Blankley convincingly demonstrates that the West is not merely faced with a few thousand terrorists. The problem is far graver and only a few are willing to say it. After the Turks were stopped at the gates of Vienna in 1683, the Islamist threat receded and the religion had become senescent by the early 20th century.<br /><br />No more! The Jews of Europe were almost completely wiped out in the Holocaust and since then, the continent has taken in millions of immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East. What a horrifying exchange this was. Many of the immigrants are alienated from their host societies and a militant, resurgent Islam appeals to these individuals.<br /><br />Add to that the pathetic cults of political correctness and multiculturalism holding sway over the political elites and in academia, and the very grave danger becomes obvious. Blankley points out that the West must now choose between its own survival and continuing to bend over backwards in extending tolerance to those who would destroy our civilization.<br /><br />Oil money and the threat of oil boycotts have made the situation in Europe much worse as documented by Bat Ye'or in her book Eurabia and by Oriana Fallaci in her books The Rage And The Pride, and The Force Of Reason.<br /><br />The author examines the attitudes of younger Muslims in Europe and comes up with very disturbing conclusions. He castigates the mass media for partisan bickering and obscuring the facts that really matter. One of the signs of a civilization in decline is Europe's native population's plummeting birth rate, contrasted with the growth of same in its non-integrated immigrant communities.<br /><br />And the religion of the secular welfare state is no match for a fanatical faith, as has also been pointed out by Roger Scruton in The West And The Rest. Europe needs a spiritual re-awakening if it is to survive at all. Liberal pieties just won't do anymore. If Anti-Semitism (even under the guise of Anti-Zionism) is the canary in the coalmine, then the poor little bird must be choking in Old Europe by now.<br /><br />Blankley offers some practical steps for the USA that must be taken soon, like the use of rational ethnic profiling, improved intelligence and the securing of borders. In addition, political correctness must now be dispensed with. He is still optimistic that with correct and timeous action, the threat may be dealt with.<br /><br />The West's Last Chance provides compelling reading in its description of the nature of the threat and the solutions.

Even after six decades, The Road To Serfdom remains essential for understanding global economics and politics. Hayek's main point, that whatever the problem, human nature demands that government be the solution, and that this is the road to hell, remains more valid than ever. He pointed out how similar the situation was under Soviet communism and fascism in Germany and Italy.<br /><br />The consensus in post-war Europe was for the welfare state and this has led to declining birth-rates, mass immigration from North Africa and the Middle East, and a tendency to exchange their ancient cultural values for the frauds of postmodernism and multiculturalism.<br /><br />In this classic, Hayek discusses matters like planning and power, the fallacy of the utopian idea, planning versus the rule of law. He brilliantly explains how we are faced with two irreconcilable forms of social organization. Either choice and risk resides with the individual or he is relieved of both.<br /><br />Complete economic security is inseparable from restrictions on liberty - it becomes the security of the barracks. When the striving for security becomes stronger than the love of freedom, a society is in deep, deep trouble. The way to prosperity for all is to remove the obstacles of bureaucracy in order to release the creative energy of individuals.<br /><br />The government's job is not to plan for progress but to create the conditions favourable to progress. This has been proved by the awesome economic expansion under Reagan and Thatcher and by the amazing growth of the Asian Tiger economies, and most recently India as it implements sensible economic policies.<br /><br />Nowhere is this more obvious than in the contrast between the phenomenal growth in formerly communist countries like Estonia or Poland against the stagnant situation in Germany and France where they never had a Thatcher.<br /><br />One of the best books by one of Hayek's intellectual heirs is In Defence Of Global Capitalism by Johan Norberg. I also recommend Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell, Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal by Ayn Rand, Freedom: Alchemy For A Voluntary Society by Stephan Hoeller and The Mainspring Of Human progress by Henry Grady Weaver.Global Capitalism by Johan Norberg.

These essays state the case for the overthrow of the sadistic Saddam whilst discussing the liberal and humanitarian case for the liberation.<br /><br />The next section, Philosophical Arguments, includes a reflection on national interest and international law by the conservative Roger Scruton, an essay on a just war against criminal regimes by Mehdi Mozaffari, and moral arguments on sovereignty, agency and consequences by Daniel Kofman.<br /><br />Critiques Of The Left is the third section. This contains the most interesting dissection of leftist positions and thoroughly undermines the fallacy created by the mass media that liberals and leftists were unanimously against the war. My personal favourite essays in this group include Pages From A Daily Journal Of Argument by Norman Geras, Ethical Correctness And The Decline Of The Left by Jonathan R'e and A Friendly Drink In A Time Of War by Paul Berman, a liberal.<br /><br />In European Dimensions, people like John Lloyd, Michel Taubmann and Anders Jerichow reveal that many prominent European intellectuals, including Vaclav Havel,  supported the war on liberal-humanitarian grounds.<br /><br />Part Five: Solidarity, contains an interview between the compiler Thomas Cushman and the Polish intellectual Adam Michnik. There are also moving essays by Timorese leader Jose Ramos-Horta, Johann Hari, Pamela Bone and Ann Clwyd. It is quite clear that unlike the rest of the Left, these authors have genuine compassion for the weak and the oppressed. An important point made here is that indifference to the plight of the oppressed means abdication of the duty to protect them.<br /><br />The volume concludes with Liberal Statesmanship that contains Prime Minister Tony Blair's full statement to the House of Commons on 18th March 2003 and another speech of his titled The Threat Of Global Terrorism. They are both eloquent arguments for the liberation of Iraq that are rooted in principle and morality.<br /><br />This valuable book demolishes many myths perpetuated by the academic and media elites and more importantly, exposes their malignant mindsets to some extent. For example, Johan Hari points out how Anti-Americanism has become a religion and how leftists ignore the crimes of sundry third world dictators. It is made clear that the anti-war camp really did not care about Saddam's victims. Then again, this is nothing new - leftists of the past also tried to suppress knowledge of Stalin's atrocities and those of Pol Pot.<br /><br />Another lie that is exposed is the myth of American unilateralism. Forty Eight countries had joined the Coalition by March 2003 and in Europe, states like the Netherlands, Italy, Hungary, Denmark, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Croatia and Macedonia strongly allied themselves with the USA. Many Asian states supported it too, including Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and the Philippines. That puts the myth of unilateralism to rest.<br /><br />In his introduction, Cushman mentions the relentless campaign of hatred and disinformation against Israel by the United Nations and the travesty of a UN Human Rights body that that includes representatives of cruel totalitarian states like Libya, Sudan and Zimbabwe.<br /><br />He also mentions the shady motives behind the anti-war position of France, Germany and Russia. These essays were written and the book compiled before the full extent of the UN Oil For Food graft became widely known, but this scandal of the century only confirms the hypocrisy of the leadership of the aforementioned countries.<br /><br />The book is not flawless. Some of the writing is perhaps too self-critical and as a Reaganite, I obviously disagree with many contributors on a range of other issues. But they are brave people who are willing to stand up for their convictions in a hostile environment. I regard the George Galloway/Michael Moore Moonbat Left as one would a hairy spider, but these authors are rational and decent. Their concern for the wretched of the earth is genuine. Their hearts are in the right place.<br /><br />I also recommend A Long Short War: The Postponed Liberation of Iraq by Christopher Hitchens, Unholy Alliance and The Anti Chomsky Reader by David Horowitz, The Force Of Reason by Oriana Fallaci plus everything written by the wonderful Norman Geras.ocrisy of the leadership of the aforementioned countries.

Hayek's main point, that whatever the problem, human nature demands that government be the solution, and that this is the road to hell, remains more valid than ever. He pointed out how similar the situation was under Soviet communism and fascism in Germany and Italy.<br /><br />The consensus in post-war Europe was for the welfare state and this has led to declining birth-rates, mass immigration from North Africa and the Middle East, and a tendency to exchange their ancient cultural values for the frauds of postmodernism and multiculturalism.<br /><br />In this classic, Hayek discusses matters like planning and power, the fallacy of the utopian idea, planning versus the rule of law. He brilliantly explains how we are faced with two irreconcilable forms of social organization. Either choice and risk resides with the individual or he is relieved of both.<br /><br />Complete economic security is inseparable from restrictions on liberty - it becomes the security of the barracks. When the striving for security becomes stronger than the love of freedom, a society is in deep, deep trouble. The way to prosperity for all is to remove the obstacles of bureaucracy in order to release the creative energy of individuals.<br /><br />The government's job is not to plan for progress but to create the conditions favourable to progress. This has been proved by the awesome economic expansion under Reagan and Thatcher and by the amazing growth of the Asian Tiger economies, and most recently India as it implements sensible economic policies.<br /><br />Nowhere is this more obvious than in the contrast between the phenomenal growth in formerly communist countries like Estonia or Poland against the stagnant situation in Germany and France where they never had a Thatcher.<br /><br />One of the best books by one of Hayek's intellectual heirs is In Defence Of Global Capitalism by Johan Norberg. I also recommend Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell, Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal by Ayn Rand, Freedom: Alchemy For A Voluntary Society by Stephan Hoeller and The Mainspring Of Human progress by Henry Grady Weaver.cs by Thomas Sowell, Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal by Ayn Rand, Freedom: Alchemy For A Voluntary Society by Stephan Hoeller and The Mainspring Of Human progress by Henry Grady Weaver.	2005-09-24

A thorough and exhaustive work, it explores, amongst other things, monotheism, the concept of the sanctity of life, the Israelite prophets, the birth of Christianity, the Enlightenment, the Holocaust and the establishment of modern Israel.<br /><br />The narrative is compelling on many levels, as a work of general history, as a tome of metaphysical and philosophical thought and in its discussions of historic personalities. The seven chapters are: Israelites, Judaism, Cathedocracy, Ghetto, Emancipation, Holocaust, and Zion.<br /><br />The scope of History Of The Jews is too vast and its insights too edifying to be summarized in a short review. To do it justice, it needs a review the size of a small book! The question posed by the author in the Prologue: Is there a providential plan of which we are the agents?, is answered with a resounding yes when one reaches the end.<br /><br />I enjoyed Part Seven: Zion, the most, as it charts the events leading to the restoration of Israel and this brave little country's survival against impossible odds. Those who do not see a divine hand behind the history of the 20th century must be wilfully blind.<br /><br />If this were the only book he had written, Paul Johnson would still be a hero and a genius in my eyes. His account of the terrible suffering and the awesome contribution to mankind of the Jewish people will stand the test of time. But history is still being written despite the fatuous title of Fukuyama's famous book. There is hope that God's miracle nation will play a greater and happier part in the future.<br /><br />This masterpiece concludes with a postscript, a glossary, extensive source notes and a thorough index.	2005-09-23

In these 14 chapters the author describes his own awakening to the knowledge of the role of Israel and the Jewish people in God's plan.<br /><br />He explores the profound contribution of the Jews in both the secular and spiritual fields, and explains convincingly why this nation has always been targeted for oppression and genocide.<br /><br />Finto looks at the early Jewish Church in Jerusalem and how the later church became separated from its roots after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. The rejection of its Jewish roots severed Christianity from its spiritual source to a large extent, leading to countless schisms and divisions up to the present.<br /><br />If you have ever wondered why there are so many churches and so much disagreement amongst them, this book will make it very clear. And for a heart-rending account of how so-called Christians persecuted the Jews down the ages, please consult Michael L Brown's book Our Hands Are Stained With Blood.<br /><br />The author then discusses the birth of modern Israel in 1948, pointing out the hand of providence in its restoration and survival. Since then, and especially since 1967, the original Church has also been restored in the form of Messianic Jews. They are Jewish people who believe in Yeshua our Redeemer.<br /><br />Chapter Eleven considers the words of the apostle Paul and sees in them a fulfilment of prophecy, as true Christians and Jewish followers of our Saviour start embracing one another. Finto warns about a deteriorating world situation in Chapter 13, explaining that the birth pangs of the reunited Body of Christ will not occur without trial and tribulation.<br /><br />Chapter 14 provides valuable practical advice on how to love and support the Jewish people in these times. We must become aware of the new Anti-Semitism (often disguised as Anti-Zionism), and counteract the prejudice of the mass media against Israel where possible. In this regard, I refer the interested reader to the book The New Antisemitism by Phyllis Chesler. Finto observes that those who are not actively involved become passively wicked.<br /><br />Furthermore, our devotion to Israel and those still in the Diaspora must never be tied to their acceptance of Yeshua as Messiah. Those attempts have only led to disaster in the past. In any case, Israel has friends amongst adherents of all religions, even atheists and agnostics like the wonderful Oriana Fallaci.

She identifies the historical and spiritual dimensions of the current struggle against our civilization by detailing how the enemy has been weakening our culture in the aftermath of the 1973 Yom Kippur War.<br /><br />Oil wealth has been harnessed to wage psychological and diplomatic warfare in order to subvert the Judeo-Christian and Enlightenment roots of Europe and turn it into a limp-wristed post-modernist culture as a prelude to subduing it completely. The most disturbing revelations concern the European intellectual and political elites that have colluded in this process of undermining our heritage.<br /><br />The clearest signs of the extent to which they have succeeded are the Anti-American, Anti-Zionist and Pro-Palestinian attitudes of much of Europe nowadays, demonstrating the effects of the intelligentsia on ordinary people via the media. By playing on European resentment of American dominance, the enemy is succeeding in breaking up the Western Alliance.<br /><br />There is also the gruesome convergence of a resurgent fascist Anti-Semitism with the Islamist resentment of the existence of Israel. One of its manifestations is Palestinianism, where the Western cultural pathology of guilt is being exploited to turn the West against Israel. Other forces are at work too, like French envy of Anglo-Saxon pre-eminence and the material benefits of close economic co-operation with the oil-rich countries of the Middle East and North Africa.<br /><br />After the Yom Kippur War and the subsequent raising of oil prices, France threw itself into the arms of the oil-producers and influenced the European bureaucracy to follow suit, by means of the EAD (Euro Arab Dialogue) and the Parliamentary Association for Euro-Arab Co-operation (PAEAC).<br /><br />Shamelessly abusing the western value of tolerance and leftist fads like relativist multiculturalism, the enemy has been gaining ground whilst giving nothing in return. Thus Israel has been turned into an international scapegoat while atrocities and genocide in places like Sudan, Chechnya and Rwanda plus human rights abuses in Islamic countries have been ignored.<br /><br />The various strands of this European policy of dhimmitude encompass appeasement, bribery, and the encouragement of Anti-Americanism and Anti-Semitism in the guise of Anti-Zionism. Thus decades of Leftist undermining of Western values and multiculturalist indoctrination in academia are bearing their poisonous fruit. It is of the utmost importance for those who cherish the West to understand that the war against Israel is a war against all of us.<br /><br />By denying its roots, Europe has destroyed its defences. For example, the socialist welfare state has contributed greatly to a declining birth rate on the continent. Now it must cope with millions of immigrants, many of whom are hostile to the host culture and refuse to integrate. What a horrible historical exchange took place: Six million Jews murdered and barely five decades later there are up to twenty million immigrants with a significant alienated component in their midst.<br /><br />The Ottomans were halted at Vienna in 1683 but Europe now finds itself in a very vulnerable situation. Sold out by their elites, the ignorant taxpayers of Europe are subsidising the slow destruction of their civilization. Unless there is a spiritual re-awakening and a rediscovery of the European heritage, the future looks bleak.<br /><br />Eurabia is a magnificent book, thoroughly researched and well written.

The thread that binds them is the cultural and moral decline of Western civilization.<br /><br />The wide ranging topics encompass inter alia Princess Diana, Shakespeare, George Orwell, Virginia Woolf, DH Lawrence, the crassness of popular culture, the underclass in the UK, the legalisation of drugs and Muslim communities in the West.<br /><br />With breathtaking eloquence and impressive insight, Dalrymple analyses these miscellaneous but interwoven subjects. His observations are interspersed by anecdotes from his experiences as a medical practitioner.<br /><br />He blames the intellectual elites for much of the decay in the quality of life, arts and culture. In no small part this flows from their moral relativism and their denial of the existence of good and evil.<br /><br />These liberal elites are quick to hail all forms of transgression while worshipping a twisted concept of tolerance and denying vice. Their hysterical insistence on \\"understanding\\" is becoming increasingly loud, but their relativism is remarkably selective. In extreme cases, it results in the total inversion of good and evil.<br /><br />Thus we get the absurdity of political correctness. But PC is not only absurd, it is sinister too: assenting to untruth is to condone evil. It is easy to control a society of powerless liars.<br /><br />The author's comparison of Aldous Huxley and George Orwell on the one side (constructive), with Virginia Woolf and DH Lawrence (destructive and foolish) is particularly thought provoking.<br /><br />Dalrymple points out how an eerie silence results when for example, the feminist piety meets the piety of multiculturalism, like the reaction of Western Leftists when confronted with gender apartheid in the Third World. They simply ignore it.<br /><br />He identifies the cause of much of the present mindset as an unholy alliance between libertarians who claim consumer choice as the ultimate answer, and leftists who believe that people have rights but no responsibilities.<br /><br />Although the book deals with many unpleasant subjects, Dalrymple's insights are original and phrased in awesome prose.

Conquest analyses the erroneous myths of past and present that have caused so much suffering and destruction. He identifies a certain vague and abstract idea of righteousness with its own peculiar speech, that leads to a mindset of dislocation from reality. In this vein, he looks at the way terms like Democracy, Progress and Liberty are abused to distort reality. For example, democracy is meaningless without the rule of law and the acceptance of the rules of the political game.<br /><br />In the chapter [[ASIN:1932236473 After Utopia]], Conquest points out that the New Utopianism is primarily a rejection of reason and an embrace of nihilism. He brilliantly contrasts the French Enlightenment that led to the [[ASIN:1933859180 negative utopianism]] of Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot, with the British Enlightenment of Adam Smith, David Hume, James Madison and Edmund Burke, one that bore good fruits.<br /><br />Western academia and the [[ASIN:1594032122 mass media]] are still dominated by negative utopianism and most of the intellectual elites are impervious to fact or argument. In the chapter Slouching Towards Byzantium the author dissects the idea of the European Superstate with a swift, sharp sword, demonstrating its non-representative nature as a bureaucratic monstrosity ruled by self-perpetuating elites.<br /><br />Chapter 10 explores the massive deception practiced by the Soviet Union and how that propaganda was swallowed by a gullible Western media and even enthusiastically embraced by opinion-shapers. Quite appropriately, Conquest alerts us to the fact that there are deeper problems than terrorism or war. From the West came the blessings of individual liberty, economic prosperity and democracy under law, but also  [[ASIN:1432705466 monstrous totalitarian ideologies]].<br /><br />The frightening fact is that the notions of this [[ASIN:193223604X seductive nihilism]] are alive and well amongst the leftist intelligentsia.

Books	5	13	13	N	N	GRIPPING ACCOUNT OF 6-DAY WAR	This short little book provides a captivating account of the 1967 war in which Israel destroyed three Arab armies and captured the Sinai, the Mountains of Israel (so-called West Bank), the Golan Heights and the old city of Jerusalem. When war seemed inevitable, General Moshe Dayan and Menahem Begin were appointed to the cabinet.<br /><br />Part 1: Prelude, deals with the lead-up to the war. Egypt, Syria and Jordan were massing armies on the tiny country's borders and Egypt closed the Strait of Tiran, Israel's only shipping route to Africa and Asia. Although it was clear that war was coming and that whoever struck first would win, some Israeli leaders were cautious because of world opinion. Israel stood alone and in fact refused help from the USA. General Dayan said, \\"I don't want American or British boys to get killed here.\\"<br /><br />Confronted with the implacable hatred of 110 million Arabs and 14 Arab Nations well armed by the Russians, it is now clear that the 3 million people of Israel had God on their side. This section also deals with the personality of the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser and his relations with the King of Jordan and the Syrians, and his adventures in Yemen. The author describes the hideous propaganda emanating from Egypt and mentions the Jordanian King's exhortation to his army to kill every single Jew. In contrast, the Israelis went into a calm determination.<br /><br />Part 2: Struggle, deals with the course of the war. On Monday morning of June 5, 1967 the Israeli Air Force leapt out like a terrible swift sword and quickly destroyed the air capacity of the Arab Nations in Egypt, the Sinai, Jordan, Syria and Iraq. In this way they lifted a black cloud of anxiety for the Israeli army. Through three main axes the army made thrusts through the Sinai Peninsula and defeated the Egyptian army.<br /><br />By the sixth day all Israel's objectives had been reached: the Strait of Tiran, the Holy City, the west bank of the Jordan, the Suez Canal, the Syrian heights from where Arab artillery had been bombarding Jewish settlements. What becomes clear is that Israel was very conscious of world opinion and had to gain as much ground as possible before the UN declared a ceasefire. The taking of the Old City is described in detail, along with the moving scenes as the Jews finally reached the Wailing Wall. On Friday June 9 the Syrians were driven from the Golan Heights.<br /><br />Part 3: Survival looks at the aftermath of the war, especially the Sinai campaign and the leaders of Israel. People like Levi Eshkol, Abba Eban, Yigal Allon, Yigael Yadin and others are discussed here. This section also looks at the motives of the Arabs and the reasons that prompted Nasser to engage in his folly. It also investigates the role of Russia in arming the Arabs, the role of German scientists in the service of Nasser and the part played by the UN. After their defeat the Arabs were unable to grasp what had happened and by stopping short of total conquest, Israel made it possible for them to remain in denial. An ominous result was the withdrawal of the Arabs into their religion. In this regard, the book was prophetic.<br /><br />The fourth part of the book is by Leon Uris and is titled The Third Temple. Uris discusses anti-Semitism down the ages and claims, quite correctly, that the Bible is still being written. He calls the continuation of the Biblical narrative The Book Of The Return. Uris describes his visits to Dachau, Maidanek and Auschwitz and includes passages from his novel Exodus. This section also ends with a prophecy, about the building of the Third Temple.<br /><br />Strike Zion is a most moving account of Israel's spectacular victory and the historical events surrounding it. The book contains plenty of maps illustrating the various campaigns plus a 64-page portfolio of black and white photographs. The concluding section by Leon Uris places the events in a broader historical perspective. Strike Zion confirms once again the miraculous preservation of God's special nation and should serve as a warning to those who seek the destruction of Israel. One thing is certain, Israel will survive. It is the bridge of salvation between darkness and light.n the miraculous preservation of God's special nation and should serve as a warning to those who seek the destruction of Israel.

The success of the West is based on the practice of separating church and state, of recognizing the two different realms. This is the fundamental difference with Islam. Islamism is a totalitarian ideology precisely because the totality of society must submit to religion.<br /><br />The author argues that the political process in Western civilisation has made it so successful - western democracies are governed by politics while the Rest is ruled by force. In the West, the political process functions through negotiation and compromise. Religion and culture are binding principles but they do not prescribe. With the collapse of our Judeo-Christian heritage in much of the West, a vital defence of our culture is being lost. According to Scruton, the love of freedom alone is not enough for our civilization to survive. He considers the nation state as a precondition for democracy and the rule of law. Under Islam, the Sharia is the only source of law, is considered to be globally binding and provides no room for dissent.<br /><br />The UN is a club of gangsters. Most UN representatives do not speak for the people of their countries but only the thuggish regimes that lord it over them.  In addition, Western elites and radical Islamists both despise Western civilization. This is particularly pronounced in academia, the media and the entertainment industry. This alienation manifests also in the Muslim immigrant communities in Europe that do not want to assimilate. They enjoy all the benefits of their new society whilst at the same time despising it. There is a sick synergy between the immigrants and the elites that disparage their own heritage. This tie of hatred binds them together.<br /><br />Scruton explains the modern roots of Islamic militancy with reference to Wahhabism, the Muslim Brotherhood and the Khomeini revolution in Iran.

99335:US	50057481	ROK0I53FTTVAB	0452284988	848180184	A Long Short War: The Postponed Liberation of Iraq	Books	5	29	36	N	N	Hooray for Hitchens!	This gripping series of essays was written during 2002 and 2003 for the online magazine Slate. In the author's words, the intention was that of testing short-term analyses against longer term ones, whilst subjecting long-term convictions to shorter-term challenges. The essays are presented unchanged; only a short preface, an introduction and an epilogue have been added.<br /><br />In the introduction, Hitchens sets out his convictions whilst pointing out the contradictory and sometimes completely ridiculous arguments of the anti-war Left and isolationist Right. The witty way he demolishes the facile slogans of the so-called peaceniks often makes the reader laugh out loud. Amongst other subjects, he thoroughly and comprehensively debunks the slur that an Israeli or Zionist lobby was behind the war. Identifying the [[ASIN:1403984921 Antisemitic innuendo]] and imagery employed in these arguments, Hitchens points out that the most insistent lobbyists for the new Iraq policy have been [[ASIN:0520214390 Iraqis]] - Muslim and Christian, Arab and Kurdish, devout and secular.<br /><br />The first essay: Machiavelli in Mesopotamia, of November 7, 2002, examines the \\"case against the case against regime change\\". The one titled Armchair General tackles the idea that non-soldiers have less right to argue for war, whilst in Terrorism, Hitchens explores the definition of the term. He refers to Claude Chabrol's film [[ASIN:B00007G1XF Nada]] that demonstrates the promiscuous cruelty of nihilistic terrorists. Hitchens defines terrorism as the tactic of demanding the impossible at gunpoint.<br /><br />One of the most perceptive and thought-provoking essays is called [[ASIN:0691122873 Anti-Americanism]], an investigation of the nature and history of this phenomenon on the Left and Right in Europe. Further thoughts cover some prominent domestic examples and observations on European critics like Le Pen and Haider. Hitchens suggests that a more apt term for the foreign strain would be [[ASIN:0195169565 Anti-Modernism]] or Anti-Cosmopolitanism and for the US version, Native Masochism. It is descriptive, but I prefer the word Paleotard that has emerged in the blogosphere after the publication of this book.<br /><br />The essay titled [[ASIN:1592476422 Evil]] brilliantly explores the meaning of the word from all angles. Despite the sneering of leftist intellectuals he argues persuasively that there is such a thing. Hitchens describes it as behavior that is simultaneously sadistic and self-destructive. In the trenchant piece Chew On This, he discusses Saddam's crimes, Al-Qaeda's massacres, Kurdish freedom, oil that is worth fighting for and a couple of other matters the so-called anti-war activists ignore in their ignorant obscurantism. Hitchens nails it time and again, expertly exposing the mendacious spin and the juvenile sloganeering to identify the essence, causes and consequences of the issues.<br /><br />My personal favorite is called The Rat That Roared, an amusing essay on France, the French, Chirac and De Gaulle. It concludes with this arresting description of Chirac: \\" ... a vain and posturing and venal man ... a balding Joan of Arc in drag. This is the case of the rat that tried to roar.\\" The following one: Inspecting Inspections is also outstanding, exposing the ridiculous farce of the [[ASIN:0385513194 United Nations]] weapons inspections in Iraq. In the article Not Talking Turkey, Hitchens argues that the USA is much better off without unreliable allies like Turkey.<br /><br />Insight follows insight, as the author once again excels in puncturing the hollow and misleading arguments of Christians who were against the removal of Saddam, giving examples of the Vatican's idiotic and transparently one-dimensional pronouncements and the opinions of the propagandist [[ASIN:0966154835 Jimmy Carter]]. The grinning peanut is responsible for much of the mess in the Middle East but he just cannot cease from interfering. When not waging a propaganda war against Israel through his now discredited book of half-truths, distortions, calculated omissions, downright lies and gross inaccuracies and a provocatively biased title, he's hugging Hamas terrorists and ignoring the plight of the people of Sderot who have been braving a rain of rockets from Gaza for years.<br /><br />People who preferred Saddam Hussein to oil are scrutinized in the essay Oleaginous where Hitchens dissects some contradictory positions taken by the peaceniks, briefly covers the UN Oil-for-Food scam that obscenely enriched members and clients - mostly French and [[ASIN:0230606121 Russian]] - of Saddam's regime while the people starved. He explains the absurdity of the puerile Blood-for-Oil accusation in the historical context of the Iran-Iraq War and Saudi interests rooted in distrust of Iran. Most of those UN bureaucrats, European politicians, American peaceniks and international businessmen opposed the liberation of Iraq because they didn't want to forfeit Saddam's bribes. They were the exact opposite of noble pursuers of peace: oily (scuse the pun), sleazy, unprincipled, greedy and unconscionable rogues in the pay of a megalomaniacal sadist.<br /><br />The Epilogue: After The Fall, deals with the toppling of the dictator's statue, the Gulf War of 1991 and its aftermath and the  personal experiences and impressions of the author after the 2003 liberation. He considers the 12 years between the two wars as an era eaten by locusts, rubbishing the nonsense and fabricated fears parroted by opponents of the war: the apocalyptic worst case scenarios, the mythical Arab street and the fatuous rhetoric of ideologues & propagandists like Scott Ritter and Robert Fisk.<br /><br />Hitchens covers every angle of the Iraq War in its proper historical perspective, also criticizing the mistakes and policies of the USA and other Western powers. The platform the book provides to ordinary Iraqis adds a welcome additional dimension of insight. I admire Hitchens' intellectual integrity, his detailed knowledge of history and his captivating style. This little classic offers ample evidence of Hitchens at his best, putting principles above politics and pulling to pieces a web of deception, disinformation and distortion with truth as his weapon. I also recommend [[ASIN:0520245555 A Matter of Principle: Humanitarian Arguments for War in Iraq]] edited by Thomas Cushman.

Anderson discusses the welcome changes that are breaking down the Old Media monopoly in news and entertainment. The demand for alternative voices manifests in Internet sites and the flourishing Blogosphere, talk radio, Fox News and booming book sales for publishers like Regnery.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious chapters is the one on the irreverent South Park TV series. It contains excerpts from episodes that demonstrate how devastating humour can be when harnessed as social commentary. Conservatives and libertarian definitely have an advantage when it comes to satire, as is also clear from the superb cartoons doing the rounds on the Internet. This section also has quotes from some refreshingly non-pc comedians like Julia Gorin and Nick di Paolo.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the author comments on the liberal response to the vigorous new conservative and libertarian media. This reaction has seen various attempts to silence the new voices, with no success at all. The alternative is to use smears against non-liberals, as advised by the leftist Herbert Marcuse in the 1960s. Against humour, the sour leftists are completely defenceless. They can only respond with ineffective sneers and smears.<br /><br />The final chapter considers the situation in academia and on campus, where a strong reaction is taking place against leftist orthodoxy. A bankrupt ideology is imploding and there are plenty of bright young minds and new ideas to take its place. The long-term outlook looks bleak for liberals.<br /><br />The changes in the culture chronicled in this book are also discussed or reflected in books like Shut Up And Sing by Laura Ingraham, The New American Revolution by Tammy Bruce, Unhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild by Michelle Malkin, Hoodwinked: How Intellectual Hucksters Have Hijacked American Culture by Jack Cashill, 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America by Bernard Goldberg, Blog: Understanding the Information Reformation That's Changing Your World by Hugh Hewitt.<br /><br />This delightful book concludes with bibliographic notes and an index. South Park Conservatives provides plenty to ponder and often makes you laugh out loud.

Dealing with every single country, it explores and analyses the reasons for the continent's dismal failure. Although it provides a plethora of facts and figures, the work is an accessible and compelling read as it charts the bitter history of 50 years of independence from its hopeful beginnings to today's poverty and despair. Some passages may however upset the sensitive reader.<br /><br />Africa has been cursed with corrupt and incompetent leaders who never cared for their people. There have been at least 40 successful and many more unsuccessful coup attempts over the past five decades, whilst the latest fashion is to hold sham elections as happened recently in Zimbabwe. Wherever there are natural resources like oil, the money ends up in the pockets of small ruling cliques while most ordinary people live in misery.<br /><br />The rest of Africa has followed Ghana's example. The first African state to gain independence in 1957, the country was bankrupt within 8 years. Upon taking power, African leaders appointed their cronies in government instead of properly trained civil servants, of which there weren't many to begin with. These ruling elites indulged in corruption, oppression and bribery from the beginning. Today the whole continent produces less than Mexico.<br /><br />The rogue's gallery of African despots includes Amin, Bokassa, Mobutu, Nyerere, Banda, Mugabe, Kaunda, Kenyatta, Mengistu, Nasser, Nguema and  Nkrumah. The extent of the corruption has given rise to the term Kleptocracy. Meredith also looks at other reasons for the failure of Africa, for example rapid population increases and trade protectionism in the West.<br /><br />The pattern set by Ghana is still repeating, leading to coups d'etat, oppression, misery, murder, refugees and the collapse of civil society. In the 1990s there was the tragedy of Rwanda and most recently, the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. Throwing money at the problem has never resolved anything but may instead have made things worse. Africa has had the equivalent of six Marshall Plans but most of the money ends up in overseas bank accounts. The author points out the relentless tide of graft that characterizes government and business in Africa.<br /><br />Meredith also looks at the exceptions, like Botswana, South Africa and Senegal. These countries are multiparty democracies with well-run economies. They represent some hope that Africa might one day become a decent place to live. The book includes maps, black & white photographs, explanatory notes and bibliographic references. Well-researched and well-written, it will remain the standard work on the modern history of Africa for a long time to come.oblem has never resolved anything but may instead have made things worse.

Although filled with facts and figures, the work is quite accessible and readable as it charts the bitter history of 50 years of independence from its hopeful beginnings to today's total despair, in just 2 generations.<br /><br />Ghana was the first African state to gain independence in 1957; it was ruined within 8 years. Today the whole continent produces less than Mexico. Upon taking power, African leaders appointed their cronies in government instead of properly trained civil servants, of which there weren't many anyway. These ruling elites indulged in corruption, oppression and bribery from the beginning.<br /><br />The continent has been cursed with corrupt, incompetent and greedy leaders who never cared for their subjects. There have been at least 40 successful and many more unsuccessful coup attempts these 5 decades. The latest fashion is to hold sham elections. In oil producing countries like Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria and Cameroon, all the oil money ends up in the pockets of small ruling cliques while ordinary people subsist in misery.<br /><br />The chapters are arranged according to this rogue's gallery of leaders like Amin, Bokassa, Mobutu, Nyerere, Banda, Mugabe, Kaunda, Kenyatta, Mengistu, Nasser, Nguema, Nkrumah. Other reasons for the failure are also considered, for example the rapid rise in population and unfavourable trade terms with the West.<br /><br />But always the pattern repeats: coup d'etat, cruelty, misery, murder, refugees and the collapse of infrastructure. No matter how much money the West throws at the problem. Africa has had the equivalent of six \\"Marshall Plans\\" but the money ends up in Swiss bank accounts. Since independence, the Nigerian elites have stolen about $350 billion.<br /><br />Meredith also looks at the exceptions like Botswana, South Africa and Senegal. These countries are multiparty democracies with well-run economies.

Guest takes into account factors like for example climate and history, whilst quoting African writers like Chinua Achebe, Themba Sono and Chenjerai Hove.<br /><br />The text often focuses on rays of hope amidst the despair so the book is not a relentless tale of woe. Guest identifies negative issues like tribalism and corruption and the waste of aid money while pointing out positive developments in places like Botswana, South Africa, Uganda and Senegal.<br /><br />He examines the good results in countries that follow sound fiscal and monetary policies as opposed to the vampire state in places like Zimbabwe or the failed state in e.g. Congo (Zaire). A very important point that Guest makes is that Africa can develop and improve the lives of its people without sacrificing its culture. Japan is proof enough that modernity does not necessarily threaten an indigenous culture.<br /><br />Guest discusses Rwanda's holocaust and religious clashes in Nigeria, takes a balanced look at South Africa's successes and its failures like its lack of an AIDS policy and criticises western countries for their agricultural protectionism that is holding Africa back. More Western aid is not the answer, and in some places mineral wealth has been more of a curse than a blessing.<br /><br />He makes a plea for increased trade and praises the stability that exists in those countries where property rights are respected. He also surveys the situation of the media, where both oppression and lack of money are impediments to a free press. The book ends on an optimistic note with the example of a young man in the KwaZulu province of South Africa having become a successful businessman after abandoning a life of violence.<br /><br />The book concludes with bibliographic notes and an index. The Shackled Continent can be heartbreaking at times, but the overall tone is optimistic, and realistically so.

After a brief window period of freedom under Yeltsin, Russia has rapidly become a vast swamp of corruption, oppression and deception under Putin.<br /><br />Politkovskaya tells of the trouble and suffering of ordinary people who are humiliated and exploited by the criminal nomenklatura. For example Nina Levurda, who in trying to establish the truth about her son's death in the Chechen War, became a victim of this system that when not cruel, is completely indifferent to the individual. This and other cases are discussed in the chapter My Country's Army And Its Mothers.<br /><br />In Russia, people imitate the man at the top, thus Putin is the one who shapes Russian society. It is mainly he who is to blame for the brutality and extremism prevalent in the army and the state apparatus. There are sections dealing with war criminals, brutality against privates in the military, government complicity in crime, the corruption in the judiciary, the struggle to survive in places like Kamchatka, and racism against people with a non-Slavic appearance.<br /><br />Russia's stability is of a monstrous type, where power means everything, few people hold the law in any regard, bribes keep business and the state running, and a free press has almost disappeared. Putin's bureaucrats have taken corruption to new records, unheard of even under Yeltsin or the Communists. As a lieutenant-colonel who never made it to the rank of colonel, he has the mentality of a Soviet secret policeman. The Yukos affair and the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky demonstrate what a vindictive little man Putin is and how he is steering the country towards fascism.<br /><br />This process of crushing dissent and stifling freedom has been escalating throughout Putin's first presidential term and shows no sign of abating during the second. The Western press has mostly not showed great interest in this slide to oppression in Russia. It is hard not to write Russia off when confronted by the experiences in this book: the deliberate cruelties, the cold indifference and the manipulation of the media. Mercifully there are still people like Politkovskaya and Lev Ponomarev who are brave enough to speak out. This disturbing book concludes with explanatory notes containing references.is hard not to write Russia off when confronted by the experiences in this book: the deliberate cruelties, the cold indifference and the manipulation of the media.

In Ethiopia they were known as \\"Falasha\\" which means Landless, an Exile or a Wanderer. They called themselves Beta Israel (House of Israel) and in the 1980s the community decided to make Aliyah to Israel. The highlight of this narrative is the actual Operation Solomon, when more than 14 000 of the Beta Israel were airlifted to Israel in May 1991.<br /><br />Based on about 200 interviews with people in Ethiopia, Israel, the UK and the USA plus many articles and documents, the book offers a tale of chilling suspense, great sacrifice and awesome courage and joy. The constant political intrigue leading up to the airlift made it a risky enterprise from various angles.<br /><br />Ethiopia was in a state of turmoil as the liberation movements were winning the civil war against dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam. Eventually Addis Abeba was surrounded. For more than a year, the Beta Israel stayed in terrible conditions in the city as the Ethiopian tyrant tried to use them to get weapons from Israel to fight his enemies.<br /><br />Spector describes how, at the height of the tension as the buses reached the airport from the Israeli embassy compound, the people calmly and patiently waited their turn. This was one of the main reasons the operation succeeded. From Friday 24th May to Saturday 25th May, 34 hours and 4 minutes after the first plane left Ben Gurion Airport, the mission was accomplished: 14 310 Beta Israel were safe in their true homeland. Forty-one military and El Al aircraft took part.<br /><br />One of the organizers is quoted as saying that it was a very disorganized miracle. But a miracle it was, as once again Israel plucked Jews out of danger. The moving reception of the Beta Israel at Ben Gurion airport was filled with wonder and elation, reminiscent of scenes from the Bible. Those who were still left behind were permitted to go from mid September of that year and in 1992, the 2000 Jews of Quara were also relocated to Israel.<br /><br />There are three appendices: 1. Annual and Monthly Emigration from Addis Abeba to Israel, 1977 - 2003; 2. The number of people brought to Israel in operation Solomon; 3. A conversation with Kassa Kabede, a former Ethiopian official involved in the operation. The book includes Notes and an extensive bibliography of books, scholarly articles, press articles, public and unpublished documents, private memoirs, reports, correspondence and notes, plus oral history interviews. The 16pp. of plates contain black and white photographs of the action and of some of the people who were involved.<br /><br />Operation Solomon was a highlight in the history of Israel. After all the politics, intrigue, secret deals and obstacles, the Jews of Ethiopia were delivered. The book reads like a thriller and has one on edge until the last plane had landed at Ben Gurion. Divine Providence must have played a part for things to have turned out so well. I highly recommend this suspenseful and uplifting book that portrays living history in such a compelling manner.so relocated to Israel.     There are three appendices: 1.

There is a flute too, but nobody is credited. The 2-CD set contains translations of poems from the following books of translations by Barks: Birdsong, Say I Am You, One-Handed, Open Secret, We Are Three, This Longing, These Branching Moments and Delicious Laughter. The insert lists the first lines of the all the poems recited.<br /><br />Disc One: 1. Birdsong brings relief 2. This is how I would die 3. Soul of the world 4. Again, the violet bows to the lily 5. Intricate sounds, not words, I catch 6. You said, \\"Who's at the door?\\" 7. The soul must suffer secrets 8. I saw grief drinking a cup of sorrow 9. In this river the soul is a waterwheel.<br /><br />Disc Two: A sufi was wandering the world 2. Love comes with a knife, not some shy question 3. Someone may be clairvoyant, able to see 4. Last night my teacher told me the lesson of poverty 5. On Resurrection Day your body testifies against you 6. Someone says, sanai is dead 7. Those full of fear are not really on the way 8. We tremble, thinking we're about to dissolve 9. Before Muhammed appeared in physical form 10. I, you, he, she, we 11. There is no prison so dark and small 12. Moses heard a shepherd on the road praying.<br /><br />The combination of devotional playing and the deep voice of Barks create a type of spiritual ambience that is more earthy than ethereal. I find the sound most relaxing and enjoyable, a fitting vehicle for the inspiring words of Rumi.<br /><br />Total running time for Disc 1 is 70:08 and for Disc 2, 77:33.	2005-08-08

These deal with all angles of life, history and politics, like the reality of living with terror on a daily basis, the Mideast War and the question of immigrating to Israel. Above all, it provides a stirring portrait of ordinary people going about their business, and then frames these accounts into a bigger picture of world history. There are some prominent names amongst the contributors, like Elie Wiesel, Natan Sharansky, Benjamin Netanyahu, Jeff Jacoby, Ken Spiro, Jack Kemp and Jeanne Kirkpatrick.<br /><br />The first part, Living With Terror, deals more specifically with eyewitness accounts of terrorist incidents up to 2003. This section can be quite harrowing and might be very disturbing to sensitive readers. Still it is important to know since the mass media hardly ever reports on the suffering of Israelis. The dignity and courage of the survivors of such attacks are remarkable.<br /><br />Part Two: Israel Perspectives, includes a powerful essay by Sharansky plus many more fascinating pieces by Wiesel, Sarah Rigler and Rabbi Wein. The most memorable chapters include thoughts on Israel's independence day, the Zionist Dream and the Holy Land as a home for the soul. It concludes with the illuminating chapter Why Jerusalem Matters by Rabbis Braverman and Shraga Simmons.<br /><br />Part Three: Israel Diaries, contains more accounts of experiences with terror in Israel and a chapter on Anti-Semitism on a campus in the USA.  Amongst the most chilling are the essays Coffee With My Enemies by Sarah Shapiro and Insidious Palestinian Television by Sue Tedmon.<br /><br />Part Four: The Mideast Conflict, contains insightful articles on the root cause of terrorism, Jewish and Muslim claims on Jerusalem, anti-globalisation and Anti-Semitism, and dishonest reporting. This is a most revealing section of the book as it uncovers the lack of media objectivity and the downright lies, like the supposed Jenin massacre where nothing of the kind ever took place. The history of the land is discussed and the facts about the various wars since 1948 are clearly provided. This part includes discussions of the Jewish and Arab refuges since 1948 and concludes with Ephraim Shore's 15 Things I Don't Understand About The Peace Process.<br /><br />The final section: Coming Home, talks about the choice faced by Diaspora Jews to return to Israel, to make 'Aliyah' to their ancient homeland. It includes a chapter on practical ways of supporting Israel, called Fifty-five Ways To Help Israel. The book concludes with a memorable essay by Sara Rigler: Loving The Land Of Israel. She concludes that the land of Israel is the place that God has designated for His rendezvous with the Jewish people. How could they spurn this opportunity now?<br /><br />This book has deeply moved me as a non-Jew, and I now understand the complex situation much better. Those who wish to know the truth about the Mideast conflict will find more than enough verifiable facts here. Moreover, a lot of the writing is filled with an authentic spirituality that is highly inspiring. I started the book with a sense of horror as I read about the victims of terror, but I ended it with a great sense of upliftment.<br /><br />Israel within its current borders is a tiny sliver of decency in a neighbourhood of unspeakable evil. Surrounded by oppressive regimes, under daily terror attack and facing hostile world opinion, this brave little country nevertheless holds on to its values of democracy and the rule of law. Although the people have been paying a high price for military preparedness, there are signs of increasing prosperity as Israeli scientists are amongst the best in the world and the people are blessed. Israel has so much to contribute, if the world will only let it.<br /><br />I would like to refer the interested reader to the following titles of related interest: Unholy Alliance by David Horowitz, The New Antisemitism by Phyllis Chesler, Myths And Facts: A Guide To The Arab-Israel Conflict by Mitchell G Bard, The Nazi Connection To Islamic Terrorism by Chuck Morse and The Mountains Of Israel by Norma Archbold Parrish.

I'm not a trained linguistic but have a passionate interest in historical linguistics and I found this book easy to digest and illuminating. For a state-of-the-art reference work on classification, there is no equivalent!<br /><br />In each language family, the author traces the history of classification within that group and concludes with the very latest research. Each chapter has its own exhaustive bibliography and there is a bibliographic update. The book is illustrated with 21 helpful maps indicating the geographical spread of language families whilst countless tables and figures support the text.<br /><br />There are personal name, language group and language indexes plus a detailed Complete Classification comprising 77 pages. The last chapter, Postscript 1991, is the most fascinating of all since here the author explores long-range comparisons, Nostratic/Eurasiatic, Amerind, Dene-Caucasian, human genetics as per the work of Cavalli-Sforza (Fig. 9.2: Comparison of the genetic tree and linguistic phyla). I highly recommended this work to all who are interested in linguistics, anthropology and the history of the human race.<br /><br />I also recommend Ruhlen's On The Origin Of Languages: Studies In Linguistic Taxonomy, The Origin Of Language: Tracing The Evolution Of The Mother Tongue, Sprung From Some Common Source: Investigations into the Prehistory of Languages, edited by Sydney M Lamb, and Indo-European and its Closest relatives: The Eurasiatic Language Family by Joseph H Greenberg.	2005-08-07

This very engaging book is an attempt to uncover at least some of the secrets of language and to dismantle the stated paradox. By drawing on recent discoveries in linguistics, Deutscher explores the elusive forces of creation, change and the innate structure of language. In addition, he investigates the way that the elaborate conventions of communication develop in human society. This cultural evolution means the emergence of behavioural codes that are passed on from generation to generation.<br /><br />Chapter One: Castles In The Air, takes a close look at the structure of language, whilst the following chapter: Perpetual Motion, demonstrates linguistic development and change with particular reference to English, German, French and the Indo-European language family as a whole. Chapter Three: Forces Of Destruction, is a further investigation of how and why changes in sound and meaning take place, with many examples from Indo-European. Chapter Four examines interesting verbs like \\"To have/to hold\\" and the concepts of space and time in linguistic expression.<br /><br />Chapter Five: Forces Of Creation, is a discussion of how new words and structures arise, how meanings change and how languages are enriched by these developments. Chapter Six looks at the need for order in languages and contains lots of interesting information on the Semitic family and its intricate verbal system. In essence, the effects of erosion interact with the mind's craving for order. There is thus a constant search for regular patterns and spontaneous analogical innovations arise. This is based on erosion + expressiveness and erosion + analogy.<br /><br />The final chapter brings it all together and includes detailed discussions of possessives, quantifiers, plural markers, articles and the various interactions of verbs and nouns. This highly entertaining read is accessible to the non-linguist and explains many fascinating features of language and its structure.

He looks at the moral aspects of the writings of Freud, [[ASIN:0440351839 Carl Jung]], Wilhelm Reich and DH Lawrence, in which he sees the birth of Psychological Man and the victory of relativism. He observes that psychoanalysis was instrumental in breaking down standards of morality and undermining religion. But in the 19th century, rationalism had already weakened Christianity in its heartland. The negative trends that replaced it contain no positive symbolism and above all, require no commitment.<br /><br />Rieff does not deny the obvious literary genius of these authors and thinkers but rejects their respective faiths of the inner God, hedonism and impulse. Defining faith as \\"the compulsive dynamic of culture,\\" Rieff does not think that any of the aforementioned substitutes has what it takes to serve as integrating factor for Western culture. They lack the binding force of commitment, enhance hedonist tendencies and undermine virtue. The feeling of the individual is exalted over the virtuous as a measure of value. This matter is brilliantly examined by Theodore Dalrymple in [[ASIN:156663721X Our Culture, What's Left of It]].<br /><br />He argues that the negation of concepts like good and evil has become the foundation upon which personality is formed. The [[ASIN:084993950X dangers are obvious]]. The therapeutic society provides an easy, feel-good substitute to religion that severs the roots, leading to selective morality and [[ASIN:0060761296 shamelessness]]. I'm not so sure about his criticism of Jung's version of the immanence of God - an ancient concept present in most major religions - but it cannot be denied that the idea encourages New Age drivel, fake spirituality and gross superstition.<br /><br />The Triumph Of The Therapeutic is a brilliant study of [[ASIN:1406768537 faith]], psychology and [[ASIN:0385511841 culture]] and the ties between them, whether one always agrees with the author or not. The writing style is elegant with many a bon mot and memorable turn of phrase. Rieff's observations and predictions are today confirmed by the situation in Europe where the civilizational crisis is most evident. Birthrates have fallen, unassimilated immigrant communities have created two societies in many cities whilst the intelligentsia cling to a false ideology of pacifism that masks resentment at powerlessness and in some instances becomes complicit with evil.<br /><br />This European malaise is very thoroughly examined, from various angles, by Bruce Bawer in [[ASIN:0767920058 While Europe Slept]], Claire Berlinski in [[ASIN:1400097703 Menace in Europe]], Walter Laqueur in [[ASIN:0312368704 The Last Days of Europe]] and Chantal Delsol in [[ASIN:193223604X Icarus Fallen]].he author or not.

In this masterpiece he investigates the Leftist mindset, Leftism in history and in the foreign policy of the USA. Most important, the book provides a valuable description of Real versus False Liberalism.<br /><br />Kuhnelt-Liddihn's aim was to reinforce the noble Western tradition of individual freedom that has been under assault for so many decades now, from so many sides. Not an easy read, the book can be quite exhausting in places as the author puts his vast knowledge of human thought to work in support of his great insight.<br /><br />Under the Leftist Mind, he discusses certain good forms and bad forms of government as they manifest in the realm of politics, e.g. monarchy versus tyranny, aristocracy vs oligarchy and republic vs a democracy. In this section he also explores some 40 odd characteristics of the Leftist mind, like hatred of freedom, secular fanaticism and materialism.<br /><br />In the section titled Leftism In History, Kuhnelt-Leddihn provides an awesome analysis of Leftist history with reference to the French Revolution, the birth of the USA, and various manifestations of collectivist movements like Socialism, Communism, Marxism, Fascism and Nazism. He considers the French Revolution as the most characteristic manifestation of Leftism.<br /><br />The author then examines American foreign policy under Wilson and Roosevelt, the Vietnam War and the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. Here he also talks about the fanatical nature of totalitarian ideologies that fills the void left by an imploding Christianity.<br /><br />The passage on Liberalism, Real and False, reveals profound truths. Under Real Liberalism, he discusses the thinkers, the timeframe, the leaders, and attitudes towards religion. Adam Smith, de Tocqueville, Burke, [[ASIN:0945466242 Mises]], [[ASIN:0226320669 Hayek]], Lloyd George and Churchill are some of the names mentioned here.<br /><br />Then he discusses [[ASIN:0385511841 False Liberalism]], which is modern [[ASIN:1432705466 Leftism]] in the USA. He asks why the meaning of Liberal has undergone such a total inversion so that it now represents illiberal statism, and provides the answer. Leftists laid claim to the future, to terms like Progressive, whilst Conservatives tended to adhere to the status quo. He calls America's current version of liberalism \\"a boring mixture of modernity, mediocrity, mimicry and naivete.\\"<br /><br />This thought-provoking book remains a classic and has grown in stature since it was first published.ich is modern [[ASIN:1432705466 Leftism]] in the USA.

This impressive work is a study of language dynamics over five millennia. Ostler deals with the birth, rise and decline of those languages that spread most widely through history, and the factors that played a part, like trade, conquest and culture. Of course the book is also by definition a history of civilization. The narrative begins in Sumeria and ends with English as the most important international language of today. The author rightly observes that the study of language history and [[ASIN:0804738122 historical linguistics]] will be mutually rewarding. He also attempts to indirectly capture the inward history of languages & the subtle mindsets that characterize individual ones, especially as regards the abandonment of mother tongues for new languages.<br /><br />Part Two: Languages by Land, looks at the [[ASIN:014012523X Middle]] & Far East: Sumerian, Akkadian, Phoenician, Aramaic, Arabic, Turkish & Persian, Egyptian & Chinese whilst chapters 5 & 6 considers Sanskrit & Greek respectively. The last two chapters deal with Celtic, Latin, German & Slavic. Part Three: Languages by Sea, explores the spread of Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French, and the remarkable career of English. Part Four deals with the current Top 20 languages and reflects on the meaning and implications of the global survey.<br /><br />The life-spans of languages differ greatly; if one compares Latin with Greek, for instance, Greek continued to thrive under Roman hegemony alongside Latin and eventually supplanted Latin again in the Byzantine Empire. Some significant civilizational languages like Latin and [[ASIN:0345431707 Sanskrit]] have all but died as spoken tongues, but they gave birth to rich families of related languages, whilst Old Chinese's pictographic script still serves its daughter languages very well.<br /><br />A major change occurred around the 16th century when the European voyages of discovery spread the languages of Europe far and wide to the Americas, Africa and Asia. Launched by trade, these languages became tongues of empire through conquest. In that way Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and English spread around the globe. Dutch gave rise to the vibrant Afrikaans in Southern Africa and lingers on in some form or other in Suriname and on some tiny Caribbean islands but has disappeared from Indonesia. French & Russian are in decline, having lost much prestige and many speakers the last few decades.<br /><br />Ostler differentiates between languages that grew organically (like Chinese) and those that grew by \\"merger and acquisition\\". Of the former, Mandarin Chinese is spoken by more than a billion people whilst English with around 500 million, is in second place. Hindi (derived from Sanskrit) is third with about 490 million, followed by Spanish in 4th place with 418 million speakers. Of course as a second language, English is of greater global importance than Mandarin. The book is full of fascinating facts and stuff that will appeal to linguists and hobbyists alike. For example: There are an estimated 7000 linguistic communities today, but at least half of them are on the verge of extinction with fewer than 5000 speakers. Within one generation many of these languages will disappear.<br /><br />[[ASIN:3110139006 Migration]] was the primary cause of language spread. Global navigation arrived later and today we have electronic communication. There is an interesting passage of speculation on the future of English. Ostler identifies prestige & learnability as the two main growth factors in creating a larger human community. The first might offer wealth, wisdom or literary enjoyment to attract speakers. The ability to learn a new language depends on structural similarities between the population group's existing language & the new one. Owing to structural correspondences, Arabic took root where Afro-Asiatic languages like Egyptian & Aramaic were spoken but it could not displace Persian or Spanish. It is well known that speakers of Japanese learn Turkish easily but battle with English for the same reason.<br /><br />For those interested in the many facets of language, I also recommend: [[ASIN:0804728054 On the Origin of Languages]] and [[ASIN:0804718946 A Guide to the World's Languages]] by Merritt Ruhlen, [[ASIN:0805080120 The Unfolding of Language]] by Guy Deutscher, Genes, Peoples, and Languages & [[ASIN:0201442310 The Great Human Diasporas]] by Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza plus The Power of Babel: A Natural History of Language by John McWhorter.

The structures of the Stone Age were built by using a very precise unit of measurement, called the megalithic yard. The book explores the science behind prehistoric units, their mathematical origin and means of reproduction, and proves that these are linked to the dimensions of the solar system.<br /><br />The reader must have a basic knowledge of arithmetic but overall the book is an easy read and very revealing. Amongst the topics discussed are writing, Egypt, Sumeria, the Minoan foot, solar and sidereal days, pendulums and the importance of the planet Venus. It turns out that the British Pound and Pint are both derived from ancient measurements. The units of the hour, minute and second were developed more than 4000 years ago, from the movements of the moon.<br /><br />The text also encompasses subjects like the harmony of the spheres, Sumerian degrees and the calendar, and explains that the metric system is not a recent invention. There is a section on Thomas Jefferson and his achievements; this great man apparently realized that he was rediscovering parts of a very ancient system.<br /><br />Amongst the most captivating sections is the chapter on music and light. There is a definite correspondence between the rotating mass of our planet and human music. Also, megalithic mathematics produces its own musical structure. The authors conclude that there must have been an advanced people who instructed the rest of the world in science and technology. They also refer to the Masonic concept of the Great Architect of the Universe.<br /><br />There are seven appendices that include further information on earth days and the megalithic year, megalithic music, the Phaistos Disc, the amazing barley seed, and the connection between megalithic principles and Freemasonry.

The book - of which a constantly updated version is online - presents the myths and then demolishes them backed by references to verifiable sources.<br /><br />The chapters include Israel's Roots, The Mandatory Period, Partition, The War of 1948, The 1967 War, Between the Wars, The War of Attrition, The Yom Kippur War, Boundaries, The Gulf Wars, The United Nations, The Refugees, Human Rights in Arab Countries and in Israel and the Territories, Jerusalem, US Middle East Policies, The Arms Balance and The Media.<br /><br />Among the topics discussed are the Balfour Declaration of 1917, the slanderous accusation of Zionism as racism, Jewish immigration to the area, the number of Arab states besides Egypt and Syria who were involved in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the shameful record of the United Nations in condemning Israel, and the vile Anti-Jewish rhetoric of the UN. The role of the notorious Haj Amin Al-Husseini, Mufti of Jerusalem, and his dalliance with Nazi Germany is also covered. Each myth and its refutation by the facts are backed by copious notes and references.<br /><br />One of the most interesting things I learnt is that in the early 20th century, certain influential Arabs welcomed Jewish immigration to the land, like Dawood Barakat, the editor of the Egyptian paper Al-Ahram, in 1913, and Sherif Hussein, guardian of the Islamic Holy Places in Arabia.<br /><br />This contrasts sharply with the quotes in the chapter Arab/Muslim Attitudes Toward Israel, under the headings Anti-Semitism, Fabrication Of Abuses, Holocaust Denial, Phased Plan & the Destruction of Israel, and Sanctioning Violence.<br /><br />These quotes, from Arab leaders, sermons of preachers, columnists in the mainstream press, high officials, academics, Palestinian Christian clerics, and Palestinian Authority spokespeople and officials, include direct calls for the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews, to praise for Hitler, despicably racist remarks about Jews, holocaust denial and the threat of nuclear attack.<br /><br />These words, intended for local consumption, are rarely reported in the Western media. Quite clearly there is a type of psychosis at work here, a hatred irrational beyond comprehension. Anyone who believed that Israel's neighbours really want peace will come to the opposite conclusion after perusing these chilling, heartless and despicable utterances.<br /><br />There is an Index Of Myths, Key Documents including The Balfour Declaration, The Hebron Protocol, The Peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, various United Nations Security Council Resolutions and other info like Israeli statistics on life expectancy, US assistance to and trade with Israel, and economic indicators. This book is absolutely essential for understanding the history and the present situation in the Middle East.<br /><br />For further information and related matters, I recommend The Case For Israel by Dershowitz, The Mountains Of Israel by Norma Archbold Parrish, Inside The Asylum by Jed Babbin, Eurabia by Bat Ye'or, The Nazi Connection To Islamic Terrorism by Chuck Morse, The Israelis by Donna Rosenthal and The Anti-Chomsky Reader, edited by Horowitz and Collierristian clerics, and Palestinian Authority spokespeople and officials, include direct calls for the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews, to praise for Hitler, despicably racist remarks about Jews, holocaust denial and the threat of nuclear attack.

What emerges is quite astonishing and not at all what many Christians have been led to believe. In the context of the Hebrew idioms, many perplexing utterances of Jesus become perfectly clear.<br /><br />Chapter One presents the evidence for the Jewish background of the early church and discusses the early Hebraic names for the church. The fascinating Chapter Two deals with Jewish idioms in the teachings of Jesus; it includes passages on the parable of the reed and the oak, the golden vine, binding and loosing, the good eye and sounding the trumpet.<br /><br />Chapter Three examines misconceptions regarding the law. It includes discussions of the law and grace, the Holy Spirit and the law, Paul and the law, the famous Gnostic Marcion and his view of the law, the letter of the law, the purpose of the law, and great Christian leaders' view of the law.<br /><br />Chapter Four explores the old and the new covenants, the Noachide laws and 4th century theology, whilst the next chapter looks at subjects like the Holy Spirit, grace and gifts before Christ, the three stages of salvation and the relationship of the law to the New Testament.<br /><br />Chapters Six to Nine are an in-depth study of the Pharisees, including their theology, their study and worship, and the Sadducees, Scribes and Essenes. There are also passages discussing their duties, their communities and the different types of Pharisee.<br /><br />Their teachings are discussed in Chapter Eight, which includes discussions of miracles, traditions, evangelism and teaching methods. The final chapter looks at similarities between the Puritans and the Pharisees, Pharisaic doctrines and the schools of Hillel and Shammai.<br /><br />The last chapter lists eight significant conclusions of the preceding text. These include the fact that Christianity was born within the matrix of Judaism and that the original language, idioms, customs, organizational structure and religious practices of the church were thoroughly Jewish.<br /><br />The book contains a glossary, a bibliography and endnotes arranged by chapter. I highly recommend this work to all Christians who wish to understand the roots of their faith and what Jesus really meant, especially where his words in the English translations of the Bible appear to be confusing. In this regard, I suggest the interested reader also consult the brilliant book by David Bivin: Understanding The Difficult Words Of Jesus.looks at similarities between the Puritans and the Pharisees, Pharisaic doctrines and the schools of Hillel and Shammai.

Those who long for stasis want an engineered, regulated world. They include leftists and reactionary rightists. For them, it is all about stability and control and they are distrustful of technology.<br /><br />Dynamists, on the other hand, seek a world of constant creation, competition, spontaneity and discovery.  Whereas proponents of stasism believe that progress requires a blueprint, dynamists consider it as an evolutionary process. It boils down to the craving for predictability versus the enjoyment of surprise. Stasists and dynamists disagree not only about short-term policies but also about the way the world functions.<br /><br />The book is a type of manifesto outlining the dynamist vision. It integrates the work of many scholars in describing how dynamist systems operate. The author explores how progress occurs in a dazzlingly wide variety of areas, from fashion to information technology to movies and many others. Her arguments are quite convincing as she demonstrates how open-ended trial and error is the route to human improvement.<br /><br />The Future And Its Enemies is quite an engaging read as it discusses the processes by which creativity brings about progress, prosperity, freedom and happiness. Its charms derive from the way it points out the connections between different aspects of life, dealing with subjects as disparate as hairdressing, computer games, philosophy and bio-ethics, amongst others.<br /><br />In this impressive work, Postrel has made a valuable contribution to the literature of freedom. Her refreshing angle and original insights clearly show that the organic growth of society is superior in every way to planning by arrogant political elites. Hayek and Mises would have been proud of her!	2005-07-03

She afterwards expanded the piece in order to say everything she wanted to get off her chest. In her own words, she was trying to open the eyes of those who do not want to see, unplug the ears of those who do not want to hear and ignite the thoughts of those who refuse to think.<br /><br />In her introductory dedication, Fallaci explains that the English text is her own translation and there may be oddities in the style and vocabulary, but that she wanted it to be like that because she wishes to retain complete responsibility for every word, period and comma in this book. I found her language quite charming, an Italianate version of English brimming with rage and anger.<br /><br />In the Preface, she talks about inter alia New York as a place of refuge for Italian expatriates, her family background, the struggle against fascism, the process of writing the newspaper article that eventually evolved into this book, and much more besides.<br /><br />The main text starts out with her feelings right after she saw the attack on the Twin Towers on TV and what followed. She also discusses the various reactions from around the globe, the heroism of the fire-fighters and America's unity in the face of adversity.<br /><br />Fallaci really lays into the politically correct, the followers of multiculturalism and the apologists for terrorism. While not blind to the faults of the West, she vigorously defends Western culture, even Christianity, although she claims to be an atheist.<br /><br />Talking extensively about her travels in the Middle East, Fallaci relates a humorous incident about the time she interviewed the Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran, and a sad encounter with Ali Bhutto, a former Pakistani prime minister. Her outrage at the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha statues in Afghanistan is palpable. She also gives a moving account of her meeting with the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala in 1968.<br /><br />Fallaci doesn't mince words as she talks about the growing numbers of culturally non-integrated minorities in her native Italy and the problems arising from that situation. It would appear that she despairs for the future of Europe, lashing out at certain European leaders and the political elites. She calls the EU the suicide of Europe.<br /><br />I think The Rage And The Pride must be the most politically incorrect book that I have ever read. It is brutally honest, emotional and perhaps a bit over the top in one or two places where it might make some readers' hair stand on end. But it is a rivetting read, one very special woman's testament to the dangers facing the West, and an eloquent defence of our culture.<br /><br />Those who appreciate this book may also appreciate Eurabia by Bat Ye'or, Unholy Alliance by David Horowitz, The New Anti-Semitism by Phyllis Chesler, Castle Of Lies by Christopher Booker, Terror by Fiamma Nirenstein and Fallaci's latest, The Force Of Reason.llaci doesn't mince words as she talks about the growing numbers of culturally non-integrated minorities in her native Italy and the problems arising from that situation.

He argues for taking events and the process of becoming as the starting points for analysing reality. This organic interpretation is not simple, but it does make more sense than the abstract concept of matter as assumed by scientists and philosophers for so long.<br /><br />Whitehead criticizes the idea of nature as a mere aggregate of independent entities, each capable of isolation. According to this idea, by their accidental relations entities form the system of nature. In this theory space might exist without time, and time without space. The relational theory of space is an admission that space without matter or matter without space cannot exist.<br /><br />But the seclusion of both from time is still accepted. Whitehead's alternative is that nothing in nature could be what it is except as an ingredient in nature as it exists. There cannot be time apart from space, because every event forms part of a whole and is significant in the whole. Likewise there can be no space apart from time.<br /><br />Our knowledge of nature is an experience of activity or passage. Events are active entities; their relations with one another differentiate into space-relations and time-relations. But this differentiation is comparatively superficial, since time and space are each partial expressions of one fundamental relation between events, which is neither spatial not temporal. Whitehead calls this relation Extension: it is the relation of including and does not require spatio-temporal differentiation.<br /><br />I found the book extremely challenging to read and had to go back constantly to re-read and properly assimilate previous passages in order to proceed. And Whitehead uses mathematical formulae that I am not familiar with. But people with a solid grounding in the natural sciences will have no such problem. A determination to understand at least some of this great man's ideas was certainly rewarded in reading and studying this book.<br /><br />The chapters are titled: Nature and Thought; Theories of the Bifurcation of Nature; Time; The Method of Extensive Abstraction; Congruence; Objects; Summary, and The Ultimate Physical Concepts. The book concludes with an index.ast some of this great man's ideas was certainly rewarded in reading and studying this book.

These ideologues who once sided with the USSR and other repressive communist regimes have now wholeheartedly embraced radical Islam.<br /><br />The agenda emanates from the extreme left but the influence extends far beyond, also encompassing liberal discourse and the mass media. It seems that this radical agenda has now succeeded in capturing the heart and soul of the Democratic Party.<br /><br />Unholy Alliance exposes and dissects the Left in fine detail, seeking for answers to why it has made an alliance with a reactionary and oppressive religious ideology. Also why it tried to undermine the War on Terror by opposing the liberation of Afghanistan and Iraq. The fracture of the consensus in American politics is another topic discussed here.<br /><br />Part One, A Defining Moment, takes the investigation from 9/11, the response of the Administration, and the Left's response to that. It shows how the Left declared war on the War on Terror and started organising demonstrations long before any action was taken, becoming the vanguard for Saddam and the Jihad terrorists.<br /><br />Part Two explores the Mind of the Left in a series that includes communist forerunners, the transition after the collapse of communism, the New Left, the Utopian Idea, the Nihilist Left and the Anti-American Cult. Throughout the book, prominent personalities are highlighted. Among them is Noam Chomsky, discussed with reference to a New Yorker profile where this nasty professor's malice and distortion of historical facts are pointed out. Chomsky's less strident but equally deceptive intellectual twin Howard Zinn also features. His plodding bestseller A People's History of the USA is a prime example of anti-American propaganda.<br /><br />The main areas of Leftist infestation today are academia, the mass media, literary circles and Hollywood. There is a powerful fisking of Norman Mailer and his detestable piece about 9/11 for the New York Review of Books.<br /><br />Part Three takes a closer look at the alliance with radical Islam and how it operates. It is shown to be an update of the Nazi-Communist entente. The introduction of communist thought and methods into Islam began with the Khomeini revolution in Iran. The last decade saw the Islamic transformation of the Palestinian struggle, which was completed by year 2000.<br /><br />Chapter 16, The New Radicalism, revisits the UN's Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. This is where an array of dictators and tyrants met for a freakshow to condemn the West and where the Nihilist Left first showed its true colours. Israel, the USA and the UK were the only countries attacked by a bunch of the most oppressive regimes including Sudan and Zimbabwe. The atmosphere was moreover permeated with Jew hatred.<br /><br />This conference brought together the radical Islamists with American NGO's and other Leftist organisations. The Ford Foundation funded it. Months later this coalition would re-emerge as a global movement against the War on Terror. From it also sprang the World Social Forum that first met in Brazil in 2001, another organisation dedicated to anti-capitalist nihilism.<br /><br />Parts 4 looks at the War at Home by discussing the Anti-War protests and revealing by whom they were funded and organized. Homeland Security and the assault on the Patriot Act are further subjects. Part 5, A Nation Divided, demonstrates how the Democratic Party shifted from supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom to becoming vicious opponents using tactics unprecedented in a time of war. The transformation happened in a few months, as revealed by the words of people like Al Gore and Jimmy Carter.<br /><br />The chapter Anti-War Democrats indicates how prominent leftists have achieved power in the Democratic Party. The epilogue deals with the 2004 presidential campaign, providing plenty of damning evidence from the rhetoric and tactics of the Kerry side. Horowitz concludes with the observation that there are now Two Americas that matter: An America that embraces its heritage and vision, and an America that has seceded from both.<br /><br />Unholy Alliance demonstrates convincingly that the American Left today is far more dangerous than loony. The book concludes with 34 pages of notes and a thorough index. I also recommend The Anti-Chomsky Reader by Horowitz and Collier, The New Anti-Semitism by Phyllis Chesler, The Death Of Right And Wrong by Tammy Bruce, Eurabia by Bat Ye'or and Anti-Americanism by Jean-Francois Revel.nty of damning evidence from the rhetoric and tactics of the Kerry side.

He takes a wry look at American foreign policy during the Cold War, under Clinton and under the first President Bush.<br /><br />Next stop is Kosovo 1989 where the author shares his conversations with refugees, peacekeepers and veterans of the Kosovo Liberation Army. From there he takes us to Israel where he shares his impressions of the land and of Z, his witty tour guide. The author observes that Zionism was ultimately right and the only utopian \\"ism\\" to become a success.<br /><br />The chapter 9/11 Diary records the reactions of ordinary Americans to that infamous day and considers overseas reactions while also presenting a picture of the kooks in a Washington \\"peace\\" rally.<br /><br />He visited Egypt in Dec 2000 and regales the reader with reflections on Egypt's present and past. His thoughts on why the Arab World has fallen so far behind the West and the Far East are noteworthy as well as his descriptions of Anti-Semitism in the Egyptian media.<br /><br />In Nobel Sentiments, O'Rourke skewers a group of Nobel prize winners (including Jose Saramago and Nadine Gordimer) who issued a banal and empty statement in 2001, pointing out their imbecilic notions on the political and social future. As he so accurately observes, nothing in their fatuous statement indicates that the opinions of ordinary people are more foolish than those of Nobel laureates.<br /><br />In April 2002 the author attended a Palestinian Solidarity March in Washington DC. Commenting on the demonstration's lack of intelligible demands, he nails down the core issue of the Middle East conflict: Israel's stubborn insistence on existing and the stubborn refusal of the Arab dictatorships to accept the fact. The demonstrators consisted of a wide spectrum of moonbats, from Environmental Nuts to Black Panthers, a crazy bunch of nihilists with only one thing in common: they're all losers.<br /><br />Thoughts On The Eve of War reflects his experiences in Iraq before and after Operation Iraqi Freedom, plus reminiscences of the situation in Kuwait after the First Gulf War. The book concludes with a visit to Iwo Jima and reflections on the nature of modern warfare.<br /><br />Peace Kills may not provide as many side-splittingly funny moments as some of O'Rourke's earlier masterpieces, but it remains compelling and thought provoking throughout.

The translation into Greek was not idiomatic but literal and that is why many of the words of Jesus do not seem to make sense. These Gospels are full of Hebrew idioms and expressions that were taken literally into the Greek and subsequent translations of other languages. Most of the idioms that Jesus used can be understood only in a Hebrew context. The assumption that the entire New Testament was originally communicated in Aramaic has led to significant misunderstandings on the part of both scholars and laypersons.<br /><br />Firstly, the authors examine the Aramaic and Greek theories. Contrary to the consensus, it now appears that Hebrew was very much alive as a spoken language at the time of Jesus. The Dead Sea Scrolls also point in this direction. As proof, the authors cite scholars like M H Segal, Matthew Black and Max Wilcox. Many words in the Greek versions are not just poor Greek but actually meaningless Greek, because of the literal translation. The undertext reveals a Hebrew original.<br /><br />Recent linguistic research confirms that Hebrew was the spoken language of Israel at the time of Christ. This knowledge is enabling scholars to correct the numerous mistranslations in the English text, which was translated from the Greek. Some of the scholars quoted are Jehoshua M Grintz, David Flusser, Moshe Bar-Asher, Pinhas Lapide, Harris Birkeland, William Sanford LaSor, Frank Cross and Abbe J T Milik.<br /><br />Chapter 4 explores the extra-biblical evidence for Hebrew in the writings of Josephus and the Anti-Nicene Fathers, in the Dead Sea Scrolls, on coins and inscriptions and in Rabbinic literature. The case for Hebrew is overwhelming.<br /><br />But the most convincing indication of the Hebrew origin of these three Gospels can be found in the text itself. The Hebrew undertext is revealed in the sentence structure and the many literalisms and idioms that are peculiar to Hebrew. The authors provide many examples in which confusing passages immediately become clear when translated back into Hebrew.<br /><br />Chapter 6 considers the theological error due to mistranslation. Unfortunately there are passages of which the mistranslation has caused significant error and unnecessary theological controversies. Thus, the expression Kingdom of Heaven primarily means the community of believers, not the future kingdom. It also becomes clear that Jesus did indeed claim to be the Saviour, by inter alia referring to himself as the \\"Green Tree\\", a messianic title. The book also dispels other myths like the ones about pacifism, martyrdom and giving without discernment.<br /><br />In the Appendix, David Bivin deals with many particular texts in detail, including Matt 5:3, Luke 23:31, Matt 11:12, Luke 12:49 - 50, Matt 16:19, Matt 5:20, Matt 5:17 & 18 (about the iota and tittle). It is quite disturbing to think that for almost two millennia, believers did not read the true meaning that Jesus intended. How strange that this should only have come to light in the last century, and that most modern translations of the Bible still contain the incorrect and confusing translations!<br /><br />Black and white photographs and illustrations enhance the text throughout. The book concludes with a bibliography and biographical information on the authors. Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus is a compelling read, but too short.

All chapters are introduced by memorable quotes from scripture and by people like Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman, David Ben-Gurion, John Adams, Alexis de Tocqueville, Karl Marx, Hitler and Arafat.<br /><br />The main theme is the United States vis a vis Israel in the light of Biblical prophesy. The author explains that America's relations with the two bothers Isaac (Israel) an Ishmael (Arab nations) will determine the future of the USA. The history of these relations is explored through the record of a long line of presidents up to the present.<br /><br />The book also looks at the history of Zionism and of the restoration of the State of Israel. Prominent Americans like William E Blackstone, Louis Brandeis and Henry Morgenthau Jr played a significant role in the rebirth of the Jewish State. In the chapter A Deadly Lack Of Conviction, the author investigates the heartbreaking years in Germany from 1933 to 1945. The inaction of President Roosevelt before and during the holocaust is a stain on American history. The refusal to accept shiploads of Jewish refugees form a sad part of this picture.<br /><br />But there were better days ahead, like President Kennedy's open support for Israel as described in the chapter The Olive Replanted, where the 1967 and 1973 wars and Israel's nuclear development programme are also discussed.<br /><br />The chapter Reviving Ishmael discusses the role of the British and Ottoman Empires in the founding of Saudi-Arabia and the history of the Middle East in the light of the return of Jews to their homeland. It also contains observations on the Cold War, the doctrine of Wahhabism and the establishment of the PLO under Yasser Arafat. The next chapter, Treason, takes a closer look at Saudi-Arabia and its export of terrorism, the peace efforts of President Clinton that led to the Oslo Accords, and the sale of American arms to Arab nations.<br /><br />The role of the lunatics, liberals and liars is investigated in the chapter of that name. It visits the September 11 attacks by considering them within the moral relativity of liberal culture and criticises the government's tardiness in taking corrective action, while revealing the Saudi government's public relations influence through huge media campaigns. The main role players on the international stage are also discussed here within a prophetic frame of reference: The USA, Israel, EU, UN, Russia, China and the international terrorists.<br /><br />Chapter 12 narrows the conflict down to Jerusalem and the Temple Mount in particular, by pointing out the historical and religious significance of this structure. This section contains several prophetic quotes from the Bible. It includes a discussion on the proliferation of WMD and Israel's mercifully highly advanced nuclear strike capabilities.<br /><br />Another chapter is devoted to the new Anti-Semitism, with reference to the United Nations, the deteriorating situation in Europe and the virulent expression of this ancient poison in the Arab world. Many disturbing examples from the Arab media and from the utterances of Arab and Muslim leaders are given.<br /><br />Chapter 15 looks at the record of US presidents from Jimmy Carter to George W Bush, comparing in each case the blessings and cursings that the USA incurred as regards its relations with Israel and with terrorist organisations.<br /><br />Chapters 16 and 17 serve as a warning to the USA by way of scriptural quotes, a warning not only to reject the concept of moral relativism but also to rise in support of Israel. The church must stand up for Israel and the Jews, because they are all part of the same promise. The book concludes on a somewhat more optimistic note in the Afterword that points out how George W Bush has courageously implemented firm pro-Israel policies since April 2004.<br /><br />The book is not without blemish. The author occasionally lapses into hyperbole whilst his identification of nations in prophecy might be wrong in the case of Babylon = Iraq. I think his criticism of the US reconstruction of Iraq is misplaced; in this regard please read Natan Sharansky's book The Case For Democracy: The Power of Freedom to Overcome Tyranny and Terror. The term Babylon might also refer to another superpower, a modern day Roman Empire.<br /><br />Other books that might help to form a clearer picture include The Mountains of Israel By Norma Parrish Archbold, The New Anti-Semitism by Phyllis Chesler, the Anti-Chomsky Reader (edited by David Horowitz and Peter Collier), Unholy Alliance: Radical Islam and the American Left, and The Case For Israel by Alan Dershowitz.cy might be wrong in the case of Babylon = Iraq.

The similarity between developments in international politics and the prophecies in chapters 35 & 36 of the book Ezekiel are becoming ever more striking. Truly remarkable correspondences are becoming clear which means good news for Israel.<br /><br />Enhanced by explanatory maps, the book argues that the scriptural name for the so-called West Bank is the Mountains of Israel. This area forms part of the land promised to Abraham's descendants through Jacob (Israel) in Genesis. This is an unconditional promise that will be kept just like the restoration of Israel has been fulfilled. The maps cover ancient history, demographics, the British Mandate period and Israel's wars for survival in 1948 and afterwards.<br /><br />In the chapter The Desolate Land, the pitiful state of the area prior to the return of large numbers of Jews is described with reference to the reports of visitors like Mark Twain ([[ASIN:142093211X The Innocents Abroad]]) in the 1860s, W M Thompson in 1866 and Samuel Manning in 1874. The Ottoman Turkish occupation of this land from 1516 to 1917 was mostly a time of neglect when the Holy Land was administered as a part of Syria.<br /><br />The chapter titled Promises deals with the return of Jews to Israel from the middle of the 19th century, the League of Nations' designation of Palestine as a homeland for the Jewish people and their emigration from Europe, the Arab world, Ethiopia and Russia. Mount Seir explains the identity of the Biblical Esau or Edom and contains [[ASIN:1932687130 genealogical charts]] of Arab and Jewish ancestors. Israel's neighbors like Jordan, Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon are discussed here.<br /><br />The next chapter examines the [[ASIN:9657052068 ancient historical roots]] of the hatred for Israel, the creation of Transjordan in 1922 and the UN vote to create Israel in 1947. It includes a section on the infamous Mufti of Jerusalem and his ties with Hitler. On its day of birth in 1948, six Arab states moved to destroy the infant state. Outnumbered and poorly armed, Israel repulsed them, although Jordan occupied most of Judea and Samaria whilst Egypt took Gaza.<br /><br />Again in 1967, Israel repulsed numerically superior Arab armies, finally gaining control of the Mountains of Israel, plus the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula. Although caught by surprise in 1973, Israel once again triumphed over its enemies in the Yom Kippur War. Only the willfully blind would fail to recognize that some kind of intervention took place.<br /><br />The chapter They Boasted Against The Lord analyses the statements of Arab leaders from the 1930s and the never-ending [[ASIN:0742552276 demonization]] of Israel that is now increasing in intensity. This section looks at the plight of the Palestinian refugees in a compassionate way by comparing the absorption of Jewish fugitives from Arab lands to the situation of the Palestinians today.<br /><br />In Balaam And The First Exodus, the author observes that this story of Balaam (Bileam) and his donkey is so well known for a definite purpose, pointing out how the scenario is repeating itself. The [[ASIN:140005494X United Nations]] has been condemning Israel for its every move whilst ignoring atrocities and genocide worldwide like those in Chechnya and Sudan. Western leaders ought to take note too; they must cease their appeasement of Middle Eastern oil producers and stop trading with Iran.<br /><br />The text includes Ezekiel 35 and 36, an extensive bibliography and three indices: by year, by Biblical books and alphabetical. The maps and illustrations make the text come alive and easy to understand. This book is a most informative and enlightening resource on the history of reborn Israel. Not only does it clear up the ignorance and dispel the [[ASIN:0971294542 myths]], it also establishes an undeniable link between Biblical prophecy and ME history of the last few decades. What's more, it points toward some awesome developments that will take place in that area in coming decades, events that will affect the whole world.<br /><br />It is improbable if not impossible that the rebirth of Israel, its victories in 1948, 1967 and 1973 and the return of its people from all corners of the globe have happened by accident. The little country's remarkable [[ASIN:0980076358 achievements]] that benefit all of mankind are not well-known but of major significance. The author convincingly explains the global surge in antisemitism and the [[ASIN:0297856642 pathological hatred]] of Israel and the USA in certain quarters as part of a predictable pattern.<br /><br />The Mountains Of Israel will assist the reader to make sense of developments on the international stage and ought to give open-minded secularists plenty of food for thought. [[ASIN:1414311354 Epicenter: Why Current Rumblings in the Middle East Will Change Your Future]] by Joel C Rosenberg is a speculative but thought-provoking look at the future whilst Denis MacShane's [[ASIN:0297844733 Globalising Hatred]] investigates the geostrategic implications of the tidal wave of anti-Zionism which is just the latest mutation of antisemitism.es.

It explores the life of Nico after the Velvet Underground, covering her life in London and tours in Europe and the USA.<br /><br />I found myself devouring the text in utter fascination. It includes descriptions of bizarre performances, wild parties, weird tour experiences, eccentric characters like her one-time manager Dr Demetrius, encounters with luminaries like John Cale, a visit to the motel where Tom Waits used to stay and much much more.<br /><br />One of the funniest parts is the narrative of Nico's first experience with angel dust in Los Angeles. Underneath the humor there is a lot of sadness too but it is a strangely inspiring read. Songs They Never Play On The Radio certainly transcends the genre of rock writing. You don't have to be a fan of Velvet Underground to enjoy this classic work, as it stands on its own feet.	2005-03-24

It tells the story of Salim who left his family home on the coast to start a business in central Africa at a town on the bend in the great Congo River. The inhabitants of the town, natives and expatriates, are described with empathy and an eye for detail.<br /><br />Naipaul also narrates the history of the town as it is connected to the ups and downs of history, with great detail. His writing style is compelling and elegant, while the plot and characterization are superb. In many ways, the book illumines the post-independence history of those Africans that are of Indian descent.<br /><br />Most of them were traders and many of them went into a second diaspora after the tumult and political upheavals in Africa of the 1960s and 70s. I was particularly impressed by Salim's first experience of the voice of Joan Baez, when a record of hers was played at a party in the academic suburb next to the old town.<br /><br />Naipaul's extraordinary talent comes through in every flowing sentence and in every well-chosen word. I'm not a great lover of fiction, but this book has enriched my mind. I highly recommend it to readers of serious fiction and to historians alike. I also recommend the travel book North Of South by Shiva Naipaul, the record of a journey through Africa that ties in very well with A Bend In The River.	2005-03-18

The book recounts how it was developed, the people that developed it and popularised it, the amazing benefits it provides to sufferers of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, its preventive action against these, and its by now unquestioned role in extending lifespan.<br /><br />In the Foreword, Saul Kent of the Life Extension Foundation takes a look at studies that confirm and extend the evidence of deprenyl's remarkable life extension benefits. He discusses its role in Alzheimer's disease, its mechanism of action, safety, boosting of anti-oxidant enzyme activity and how it extends lifespan.<br /><br />The main body of the book tells the tale of Selegiline, Deprenyl or Eldepryl. It starts in the USA where instances are provided of how this medicine miraculously improved the lives of sufferers from Parkinson's disease.<br /><br />Deprenyl is part of a group called the MAO Inhibitors. The first of these was Iproniazid, originally developed to treat tuberculosis, when it was discovered that it lifted the mood of sufferers from this disease. As a result, the MAO Inhibitors were used to treat depression, but they had severe side effects because of an interaction with certain foods like cheese.<br /><br />In Budapest, Professor Joseph Knoll and Elizabeth Miller designed the molecule in 1961. Knoll kept it alive for 15 years until it went on sale in Hungary in 1978 as a treatment for Parkinson's. In 1971 Knoll argued that deprenyl does not have the side effects of the other MAOI's because it is a selective inhibitor of MAO. The article that finally opened the door to the worldwide use of deprenyl appeared in The Lancet in 1971.<br /><br />A large part of the story is dedicated to the history of the trials and tribulations of getting deprenyl approved by the FDA for sale in the USA. This finally happened in June 1989 and only for Parkinson's.<br /><br />The body's own most potent three internal free-radical scavengers are Glutathione Peroxidase, Superoxide Dismutase and Catalase. Subsequent studies have revealed that in addition to inhibiting Monoamine Oxidase B, deprenyl also strongly boosts the production of the anti-oxidant Superoxide Dismutase, and to a lesser extent, Catalase. In the foreword, Kent discusses the findings of several studies of this beneficial effect of deprenyl.<br /><br />Appendix A is Case Studies by Dr Ronald Klatz of the American Longevity Research Institute. Appendix B consists of five abstracts: 3 Life Extension Studies by Dr Knoll, Dr Milgram and Dr Kitani, Deprenyl's Effect on Superoxide Dismutase and Catalase by Dr Kitani, and The Rescue Of Dying Neurons by Dr Tatton. Appendix C provides information on Alastair Dow, Dr Ronald M Klatz and Saul Kent.<br /><br />The interested reader may also find Life Extension Magazine of value, plus the books The New-Anti Aging Revolution: Stopping The Clock  by the aforementioned Dr Ronald Klatz, and Mind Boosters by Dr Ray Sahelian.own most potent three internal free-radical scavengers are Glutathione Peroxidase, Superoxide Dismutase and Catalase.

He notes that liberals are only concerned with freedom where it fits in with their favorite fads, the flavors of the moment being multiculturalism, feminism and environmentalism wrapped in the stifling speech codes of political correctness. He criticizes conservatives by claiming that they defend individual rights only when these do not conflict with the dogmas of the right reflected in slogans like 'family values.' Singling out one faction in the large conservative tent is a bit unfair as is ignoring the magnificent libertarian reforms of Thatcher and Reagan who had a relaxed attitude to religion and whose association with the religious right was exaggerated by the media.<br /><br />The introductory chapter, Individual Soul Against Mass Mind, encompasses discussions of politics as vehicle of consciousness, antinomianism (opposition to rigid religious legalism), Jung's Gnosis of hope and the conflict of the individual with the mass. Hoeller's observations on mass-mindedness and the mass psyche correspond with and complement those of Eric Hoffer in [[ASIN:0060505915 The True Believer]] whilst his analysis of the breakdown of the stable but flawed (collectivist, hierarchical & static) Christian ecclesiastical worldview (400 AD - 1600 AD) echoes the thoughts of Chantal Delsol in [[ASIN:193223604X Icarus Fallen]] where she argues that the European soul was first wounded by the loss of Christianity and then more grievously by the tragic attempts to replace it with secular salvationist creeds in the 20th century.<br /><br />Other attempted substitutes included science, the arts and reason itself. Delsol elegantly likens the failure of these to collapsed cathedrals. Hoeller chronologically lists the factors that dissolved the aforementioned culture as Astronomy, Machiavelli, the Reformation, Physics, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, Charles Darwin's Evolutionary Theory and Freudian Psychology. The [[ASIN:0802832717 fruits of Freud]] included the evaluation of human beings in abstract terms like adjustment, socialization, infantilism and narcissism, words that promoted the loss of individual dignity, self-esteem, optimism and creativity. The relentless assault of collectivism continues under many masks; divide & rule has acquired a new meaning as the formation of antagonistic minorities is encouraged. Politicizing ethnicity and accentuating group identity through multiculturalism, condoning barbarism & terror through moral relativism and exalting nature over human life are some prominent manifestations. The history, motives and tactics are exposed with admirable clarity by Stephen Hicks in [[ASIN:1592476422 Explaining Postmodernism]].<br /><br />Hoeller considers insidious mass-mindedness as the most lethal danger facing our culture and society. As antidote he advocates the freedom and individualism inhering in the West's psycho-spiritual Gnostic tradition as articulated by Jung. A vital relationship exists between non-mainstream spirituality and the issue of freedom. The chapter The Gnosis Of Freedom covers definitions of liberty, the collapse of Soviet communism and Christianity's [[ASIN:1568215193 mixed record]] on human rights. He explains Jung's depth psychology and the spirituality behind it, demolishing Eric Voegelin's far-fetched equation of Gnosticism with the 20th century's murderous totalitarian ideologies. These collectivist or sinisterist movements like xenophobic nationalism, marxism, fascism, socialism and environmentalism were clearly the secular salvationist offspring of ecclesiastical Christianity. They share the same structure of paradise lost through sin that must be regained through suffering that will eventually create utopia. Unlike modern Christianity, they advocate and practice human sacrifice.<br /><br />Recent history has seen three main varieties of ideological tyranny: Communism, National Socialism and Islamist Theocracy. Viewing tyrants as both the pathogens and the main symptoms of psychic epidemics, Hoeller dissects their mindset & mysticism. Two types exist: (a) that established by a temporary psychic flare-up which subsequently maintains its power by force and (b) the primarily psychic type characterized by a mysterious pandemic of psychological energies that overwhelm a community. Hitler's regime was of this sort; Hoeller examines the psychological forces that drove him and his capacity for calling up projections of hatred & cruelty from the collective subconscious, noting that the German historian Ernst Nolte called Hitler a medium. [[ASIN:1440470847 Psychic pandemics]] occur in societies that lack the ability to integrate opposites.<br /><br />Revelatory insights into [[ASIN:0393327590 Utopian]] projection, possession and the antidote of wholeness abound and Western forms of government are analyzed in terms of the Tao/Dao. The chapter on Amerindian culture, Shamanic America, is followed by the important study of opposites called Hermetic and Puritan America. It was the Hermetic influence on the US constitution that led to the separation of church & state and the three branches of government. Amongst the Founding Fathers were Judeo-Christian Theists as well as Hermetic Deists (like Benjamin Franklin). The author clearly favors the Deist side and makes no effort to conceal his distrust of Puritanism, a concept that he interprets quite literally.<br /><br />In the chapter America And The New Myth Of Consciousness, Hoeller appraises the work of Joseph Campbell and in the epilogue he argues that material progress remains precarious without its moral equivalent. The enemy is extremism, whether it is that of the environmentalist of right-to-life fanatic. Both worship life unconsciously, unaware that life without consciousness is an aimless, blind force. There has to be free alchemical interaction in a process that must be permitted, not forced, to flow. He argues that Jung's spiritual-psychological approach is the most effective ideological defense of freedom as it not only encompasses both [[ASIN:0451138937 Ayn Rand's]] rational materialist and traditional Christianity's metaphysical defense of liberty but surpasses both of them.<br /><br />As a brilliantly reasoned argument for individual freedom from the psycho-spiritual perspective, Freedom: Alchemy for a Voluntary Society is not as easy a read as Hoeller's other books. For further insights, I refer the interested reader to the section Alternatives To Postmodernism in chapter 6 of [[ASIN:1410701727 New Thought: A Practical American Spirituality]] by C. Alan Anderson and Deborah G. Whitehouse. It draws on the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. Bibliographical references occur throughout Hoeller's intriguing text and the book includes a bibliography with authors as varied as Augustine, Joseph Campbell, Mircea Eliade, Manly P Hall, [[ASIN:0226320553 Friedrich Hayek]], Ludwig von Mises, Elaine Pagels and Frances Yates.s as both the pathogens and the main symptoms of psychic epidemics, Hoeller dissects their mindset & mysticism.

Along the way it also serves as a captivating cultural history of swinging London in the 1960s and the music world in subsequent decades. Marianne describes her family background, dispelling many myths along the way, and provides an absorbing account of how she entered the music business. The sequel, 2007's [[ASIN:0007245815 Memories, Dreams and Reflections]], takes the story further.<br /><br />Her recollections of touring with the popular bands of the time are fascinating, as is the way she entered the Rolling Stones circle. Her first meeting with Bob Dylan is wonderfully juxtaposed with a much later meeting in the 1980s when she explained every song on [[ASIN:B000001FSP Broken English]] to an admiring Dylan. The glimpses into the interpersonal relations of the Stones are enlightening and poignant, specially the way she describes the decline of the ill-fated Brian Jones.<br /><br />She talks matter-of-factly about her relationship with [[ASIN:B000002IUO Mick Jagger]] and the notoriety she gained with various drug busts. Faithfull doesn't spare the reader any of the detail of her long relationship with a breathtaking variety of drugs, but the most arresting parts are when she relates particular events and circumstances to specific compositions by Jagger and herself.<br /><br />She discusses all the anarchy and hedonism of the times with a detached air, observing that her generation wanted to see change everywhere but none of them could quite figure it out and it all ended up as wretched excess. The movie [[ASIN:B000JYW5EG Performance]] and her song Sister Morphine are treated in detail. The saddest part of her life was when she spent about 2 years sitting on a wall in Soho, completely spaced out, but noting how kindly people treated her.<br /><br />The making of her country album [[ASIN:B00005OADI Faithless]], a huge hit in Ireland, is described with flair, as well as her big comeback with Broken English in 1979. I really enjoyed her encounters with various musicians like the tragic [[ASIN:B00003CWJ0 Tim Hardin]] who co-wrote the song Brain Drain on Broken English with Ben Brierly. There's even an interesting snippet about [[ASIN:B0002XB9IM Cristina Monet]], wife of ZE Records founder Michael Zilkha. Why'd Ya Do It, one of the most controversial songs on the Broken English album, was written by poet [[ASIN:B0007SG6KI Heathcote Williams]]. Marianne had to beg him for hours to allow her to record it, as he wanted Tina Turner to cover it!<br /><br />There's no bitterness in any of Faithfull's writing; rather lots of humor and witty observations. She is full of praise for musicians like Barry Reynolds and [[ASIN:B000001G1B Van Morrison]] with whom she has worked. As a great fan of hers and The Stones, I am truly relieved that there were no life threatening sexually transmitted diseases in the 1960s & 1970s because then a whole generation of musicians would have been lost, what with all the intercourse between everybody.<br /><br />This book confirms why Faithfull is a true survivor and has developed into an original artist with growing stature. The scandal is well balanced by observations on the songs, the times, the making of the albums and the films. There are 45 black and white photographs and a thorough index.

The scandal is well balanced by observations on the songs, the times, the making of the albums and the films. There are 45 black and white photographs and a thorough index. I also recommend Mark Hodkinson's biography [[ASIN:0711930015 Marianne Faithfull: As Tears Go By]], an informative read on her life and career up to 1991.	2005-01-29

It's not perfect though, I would have liked more background on some of the albums (people involved in the recording, events etc) especially Cale's work with e.g. Nick Drake. The editing is a bit sloppy. In one place early in the text, the title of a newspaper has just been left out, and Cale's collaboration with Bob Neuwerth is called Last NIGHT On Earth (it is DAY).<br /><br />The chapters are: I Was Dreaming About My Mother 1942 - 60; Under False Pretences 1960 - 63; With La Monte Young In The Theatre Of Eternal Music 1963 - 65; A Radical Turn Of Events 1966 - 68; Flying Solo 1968 - 68 New York; Company Man 1971 - 73 Los Angeles; The Island Years 1973 - 75 London; In Dangerous Orbits 1976 - 80; The Terror Of The Moment 1981 - 85; Songs In The Key Of Collaboration 1986 - 90; Death Meets The Velvet Underground 1990 - 93; In Mortal Hope 1994 - 98.<br /><br />At the start of the later chapters, some song lyrics are reproduced and the albums recorded in that period are listed. A proper discography at the end would have been preferable, and an index would have enhanced the value of the book as a reference source.<br /><br />This autobiography provides valuable insights into John Cale's personal life and artistic development, and early reflections on Andy Warhol, The Factory and the legendary Velvet Underground. Great photographs and illustrations make for a very pleasing design. The book is certainly worthy of the man and his achievements.	2005-01-16
403954:US	50057481	R3JL394M6WY2XJ	0060652926	338167986	Mere Christianity	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Deeply moving and thought-provoking	In the foreword it is explained that this book is not one of philosophical musings but a work of oral literature addressed to a people at war. It was originally broadcast by the BBC from 1942 to 1944, hence the gripping metaphors like the image of the earth as enemy-occupied territory. Mere Christianity is a book of plain but moving language.<br /><br />In Book One: Right and Wrong As a Clue To The Meaning Of The Universe, Lewis looks at the law of human nature (inherent knowledge of right and wrong), certain objections, the reality of the law and that which lies behind the law. Here he discusses the materialist, the life-force and the religious views of life.<br /><br />Book Two is a discussion on what Christians believe, in terms of the aforementioned occupied territory, a coming invasion, the penitent, and the practical conclusion. This section also deals with pantheism, dualism, free will, the divinity of Christ and God's intentions with the world.<br /><br />Book Three investigates Christian behaviour, in terms of the cardinal virtues, social and personal morality, morality and psychology, marriage, forgiveness, the great sin (narcissistic pride; in this regard, please also read [[ASIN:0684848597 People of the Lie: The Hope for Healing Human Evil]] by M Scott Peck), and what charity, hope and faith really mean.<br /><br />Book 4 is a captivating explanation of the doctrine of the trinity. I found this part very interesting and sometimes deeply moving. Lewis speculates on the nature of time, the nature of man and the nature of God, as the Father the source, the Son an emanation of the source and the Holy Spirit as the spirit of love between Father and Son. Lewis explains what he thinks is the process whereby the individual receives a higher nature. This change in consciousness (infusion of the Holy Spirit) leads to a transcendence of the mortal nature by transforming the individual into a child of the divine.<br /><br />He argues convincingly for personalities in God and God as the ultimate personality. I found this very illuminating, also in light of having recently read the books by [[ASIN:1410701727 Deborah Whitehouse]] and Alan Anderson on Process New Thought, especially their view of the personhood of God and panentheism as it emerges from the work of [[ASIN:0029345707 Alfred North Whitehead]].<br /><br />Mere Christianity is a most memorable work that expresses ideas that are relevant to our times. It is a very refreshing expression of a personal Christian belief system that could serve as a strong antidote to the dictatorship of dogma or the staid boredom often associated with 20th century religion in the West. Deeply illuminating, Lewis' words I am sure make many people reconsider important ideas that they had taken for granted.<br /><br />I am not sure how close Lewis came to the truth in every respect, but much in his vision is inspiring, noble and infused with a sense of logic and common sense. Lewis' writing has an uplifting effect on the spirit. I recommend Mere Christianity to all people of faith and those in search of meaning. One might not ultimately agree with everything, but the thoughts expressed here certainly make you think.y.

In the Prologue: The Wise Men and the Dummy, the author shows how wrong all the experts were about the Soviet Union for example, and how right Ronald Reagan was. When the most powerful empire in history quite soon imploded, Reagan's prophecies came true. It was the same with the economy.<br /><br />In chapter 1: Why Reagan Gets No Respect, D'Souza looks at the Reagan enigma, the harsh criticism of the pundits and the secret of Reagan's success. It reveals a complex figure, a distinctive personality of a man larger than life. In chapter 2: The Education Of An Actor, the author considers Reagan's childhood, his career as an actor, first steps in politics and the way life prepared him for the presidency.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Reagan Goes To Washington, discusses his political career from 1964 to 1980. The part on how he confronted the counterculture chaos as governor of California makes for riveting reading. In the chapter A Walk On The Supply Side, the difficult year of 1982 is discussed, a year in which the economic prospects looked bleak. Reagan however, stayed the course and carried the country with his optimism.<br /><br />The next year, 1983, saw the beginning of a 7-year period of uninterrupted growth. The recovery took Reagan's critics by surprise, and that's when they ceased calling it Reaganomics. Contrary to popular myth, the 1980s was also a decade of great generosity, which saw a real increase of 57 per cent in charitable giving, from about 65 billion dollars in 1980 to 100 billion in 1990. In this period America became more prosperous, more innovative and more technologically advanced than Japan or Europe.<br /><br />The following chapters: Confronting The Evil Empire, Making The World Safe For Democracy and The Wall Came Tumbling Down investigate how Reagan foresaw the collapse of communism, how he planned it and how he brought it about. D'Souza points out how the intellectual eggheads got it wrong and Reagan got it right once again. Here also the events in Grenada, Afghanistan and Nicaragua are discussed. Against the odds, the Reagan administration achieved a remarkable turnaround and a massive worldwide advance towards the concept of democracy for all. The role of Margaret Thatcher and the Pope are also dealt with, and these chapters include information on SDI (the space shield or star wars as it was also called).<br /><br />In the Man Behind The Mask, D'Souza considers the paradoxes in Reagan's life, for example his personal faith, his non-attendance of church and his sardonic view of organized religion. His wit, humour and tolerance of human failings went hand in hand with an objective standard of truth and virtue. Spirit Of A Leader looks at his leadership style and qualities and how he shifted the political centre by changing the terms of the debate. This is measured in the way his opponents adopted his rhetoric and his objectives.<br /><br />Epilogue: The Road Not Taken is a rather glum indictment of the route that America took from 1989 to 1996, in which D'Souza takes the GOP leadership and conservative intellectuals to task. This book was published in 1997 so perhaps Mr D'Souza might want to get out a new edition with a more positive postscript. Well researched, the book concludes with copious notes and a though index.<br /><br />Together with Peggy Noonan's book [[ASIN:B000SSNR36 When Character Was King: A Story of Ronald Reagan]] I found this to be the best book on Reagan. He revived the American Spirit, won the Cold War and made the world safer for democracy. To learn more about this great man, listen to his speeches on the 5-CD set [[ASIN:0671693417 Speaking My Mind: Selected Speeches]], or read the books [[ASIN:0385507569 Dear Americans: Letters from the Desk of Ronald Reagan]] or [[ASIN:0789479923 Ronald Reagan: An American Hero]].s got it wrong and Reagan got it right once again.

The speeches are not about policies and do not include any state of the union addresses. Almost every speech is introduced by Reagan with his reflections on the times and the issues, with his customary wit and humour.<br /><br />My only complaint about the CD-set is the absence of a booklet with a proper track listing. The speeches are listed on the 5 discs but in a tiny font size so that one needs a magnifying glass in order to read them.<br /><br />The first speech, from October 1964, in support of Barry Goldwater's candidacy, is particularly stirring. The sound is a bit crackly here but that only adds to the magic of this momentous speech. All the others are from the White House years. Here are the most memorable ones:<br /><br />1981<br />Swearing-in ceremony/Inaugural address/Address to the nation on the state of the economy. Reagan was the first president to use a prop on TV - in this case a coin to demonstrate the effect of inflation/Address on the air traffic controllers strike, quite a powerful one.<br /><br />1982<br />Magnificent address to the UK parliament on the values of the West and our historic role in the defence of freedom/Inauguration of the USS New Jersey/The national prayer breakfast, on spiritual renewal/Christmas day radio address.<br /><br />1983<br />On the struggle for democracy in Central America/On the massacre of the marines in Lebanon/The magnificent Evil Empire speech/Martin Luther King Day.<br /><br />1984<br />Hoboken, New Jersey election speech, to enthusiastic audience.<br />Republican Convention Acceptance speech, also to enthusiastic audience/40th Anniversary of the Normandy invasion, a very stirring and uplifting one.<br /><br />1985<br />On SDI (the Space Shield) to the political action conference.<br />On the upcoming Geneva summit meeting with Gorbachev.<br /><br />1986<br />Memorial service for the Challenger dead/On the Reykjavik summit/Centennial ceremony for the Statue of Liberty/Tax reform act of 1986, a breakthrough for economic growth and prosperity/Washington dinner honouring Tipp O'Neill, showing how gracefully Reagan acted towards his political opponents.<br /><br />1987<br />Momentous speech at Brandenburg gate in Berlin on June 12th, 1987: \\"Tear down this wall!\\"/Speech honouring the heroism of ordinary people.<br /><br />1988<br />Veterans Day Ceremony: Reagan restored the dignity and honour of Vietnam vets/Republican National Convention tribute to Nancy Reagan for her campaign against drug abuse.

Noonan is one of the most captivating political writers of our time. Her columns are always edifying, witty and filled with insight. This semi-biography on the great Ronald Reagan is the same. She draws on her own and others' personal recollections to paint a vivid picture of the Reagan white house whilst also illuminating the earlier history and the post-presidential life of this noble man.<br /><br />Noonan deals with his youth, the time in Hollywood and the way he first entered politics. There is a lovely description of the Reagan ranch and a suspenseful account of how he won the presidency. Noonan also deals with the love between Reagan and his wife, and their relationships with the children. The account of Reagan's fortitude after the attempted assassination is a highlight of the book.<br /><br />The text is interspersed with significant parts of Reagan's most important speeches and interesting quotes by various people. The author also excels when she talks about Reagan's marvellous sense of humour and she has interesting angles on foreign affairs, like the president's dealings with the Soviets and the Iran/Contra affair.<br /><br />Noonan shows how utterly wrong Reagan's critics were and how his vision triumphed over that of the media and the so-called intellectuals (the eggheads for evil who always get it wrong). The chapter dealing with Reagan's voluminous correspondence is poignant and illuminating as it shows his concern for ordinary people from all walks of life.<br /><br />The chapter Big Triumph looks at the Strategic Defence Initiative (The Space Shield) in the light of 9/11, whilst the next chapter discusses Reagan's influence on George W Bush. The last chapter, The Old Man Of St Cloud Road, looks at Reagan's twilight years and his legacy.<br /><br />Throughout the book Noonan demonstrates how Reagan's courage, patience, humour and optimism led to his success and his magnificent achievements at home and in the international arena. Her writing is filled with affection and honesty and she really succeeds in making history come alive.<br /><br />This excellent book concludes with a bibliography and an index.  When Character Was King is a must for those who love Ronald Reagan.

Scars Of Sweet Paradise is a very thorough and in-depth look at Joplin's life and times and at the same time an exploration of the quiet suburban life versus the lure of the counterculture. The bohemian underground, unlike some idyllic portrayals of it, had its share of cynicism and destructiveness.<br /><br />Much of this book deals with this evolving underground as it relates to the music, gender relationships and the merger of art and commerce. It is the story of a generation's restless and reckless life on the edge, from which Janis and many others never returned. The author conducted over 150 interviews and spent 5 years on research to produce this comprehensive work on Joplin and her era.<br /><br />The Janis that emerges is a complex, multi-faceted personality that inspires admiration and sadness. The story begins in Port Arthur where Joplin's early life is described, including her first exposures to rock and folk music. It follows her to college and her first taste of the bohemian life then on to her first visit to San Francisco and eventual return to Port Arthur.<br /><br />She went back to SF and her career began to take off. It is fascinating to read about the colourful personalities that she mixed with in San Francisco: the friends, the lovers and the musicians. Echols is a skilful narrator, seamlessly blending Joplin's moves and her relationships with the rise of her career. There are plenty of quotes from contemporary musicians that really illuminate this mythologized period in history.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that the author does not seem to share in the excitement as Joplin finally makes it big with Big Brother an the Cheap Thrills album - this story is just given clinically as part of the larger narrative. The various bands, Big Brother, Kozmic Blues and Full Tilt Boogie, are discussed in detail, as well as the recording process of each of the major albums: Cheap Thrills, I Got Dem Old Kozmic Blues and Pearl. The personalities behind her success, like Abert Grossman and Linda Gravenites, are sympathetically portrayed.<br /><br />Echols explores Joplin's influence on various performers and notes that the heavy metal crowd picked up on her style but that she didn't directly inspire any clones. Ultimately, Janis appears as a brave, wild and very vulnerable human being who was quite likable, if somewhat volatile. There are 35 black and white photographs and the book concludes with a discography, copious notes and an index. Almost scholarly in its depth, Scars Of Sweet Paradise is yet a gripping read that will please her fans and all who are interested in the 1960s counterculture and the evolution of rock music.each of the major albums: Cheap Thrills, I Got Dem Old Kozmic Blues and Pearl.

451300:US	50057481	R30SSSLU5FNPD5	0312204078	508861703	Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science	Books	5	9	17	N	N	Intellectual Morons	Fashionable Nonsense grew out of the famous hoax in which Alan Sokal published a parody article in the American post-modern journal Social Text. The article was filled with non-sequiturs and nonsensical quotations about maths and physics by prominent French and American intellectuals, yet it was published unaltered. Sokal then revealed that it was a deliberate parody, to the great consternation of the editors of Social Text.<br /><br />This book extends the investigation to show how intellectuals such as Lacan, Kristeva, Irigaray, Baudrillard, Deleuze and Guattari have repeatedly abused scientific concepts and terminology. They have either used these ideas completely out of context without justification or they have thrown scientific jargon around with no regard for its meaning or relevance, obviously to try to impress their readers.<br /><br />The introduction provides the history of the Sokal Hoax and the response to it. The major part of the book consists of an analysis of various texts by Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and Paul Virilio. Brief explanations of the relevant scientific concepts plus references to popular and explanatory texts are provided. Sokal and Bricmont also investigate certain philosophical and scientific confusions behind much of postmodernist thinking, like cognitive relativism, certain misunderstandings concerning chaos theory plus so-called postmodern science.<br /><br />Appendix A provides the full text of the famous hoax article: Trangressing The Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity. Appendix B consists of comments on the parody and Appendix C serves as an afterword on the hilarious incident. This amusing and illuminating book concludes with a 14-page bibliography and an index.

The correspondence includes letters to private citizens, famous and obscure lifelong friends, and heads of state. They reveal a noble spirit, a kind and decent man who took a personal interest in the lives of ordinary people.<br /><br />The book starts with an introduction and editorial notes. The correspondence is divided into chapters for every year from 1981 to 1988/1989. Each of these aforementioned chapters has an introduction of the year concerned, discussing the major evens of that year, thus providing a historical background to the themes of the letters.<br /><br />The correspondence displays a tapestry of Ronald Reagan's wisdom, resolve, decency, optimism, humanity and humour in his replies to young people, unemployed workers, press columnists, Hollywood friends, Soviet leaders, sports figures, relatives of soldiers and critics of government policies. It shows his positive approach to the economy, his frequent frustration with the media and an obstructive Congress, and his determination to halt Soviet expansionism, to reduce taxes and to rebuild the military.<br /><br />Reagan's style was warm and down to earth and often gently humorous. Replies to his critics were factual and respectful. There are 14 black and white photographs that include pictures of Reagan with William Buckley, Michael Gorbachev, chief of correspondence Anne Higgins, personal secretary Kathy Osbourne and Reagan's young friend Rudolph Hines.<br /><br />Unlike the impression created by certain elements in the media at the time, Ronald Reagan was a highly intelligent man with a keen insight into domestic issues and international relations. Moreover he had the gift to translate those insights into language that everybody could understand. But most important of all, Reagan was wise.<br /><br />Besides being the Great Communicator, he was also the Great Correspondent as this volume demonstrates. What a lovely and admirable human being Reagan was. I also recommend the books When Character Was King by Peggy Noonan and Ronald Reagan: How An Ordinary Man Became An Extraordinary Leader by Dinesh D'Souza.

The William Burroughs Reader is an excellent introduction to the works of this innovative author, but not quite complete as it omits, in my opinion, his very best works, i.e. Queer and Junky. Besides this omission, it would be a good place to start for those who wish to explore the genius of William Burroughs.s. <br />	2004-10-30

The author obviously loves the music and his enthusiasm is tangible throughout. He loses me a bit when he dips into the socio-political mumbo jumbo, but is great when he describes funk's relation to other types of music. The section on James Brown is especially captivating, as is the author's exploration of the evolution of the style through Sly Stone, War, The Isley Brothers, The Meters, Kool And The Gang, The Ohio Players, the Average White Band and many others. Vincent is at his best and most authoritative when he talks about funk's impact on styles like jazz and soul. The chapter on P-Funk and George Clinton is especially interesting, particularly its influence on hip hop. This book is essential for all those interested in the history and evolution of black music. I also recommend Nowhere To Run: The Story Of Soul Music, by Gerri Hirshey.	2004-10-27

There are three aspects to New Thought: the psychological, metaphysical and mystical and this belief system may yet prove to be the point where religion, science and philosophy come together to eventually help bring about a better world.<br /><br />The essence and the philosophical and organizational aspects are discussed in chapters one and two. This section includes a look at the founder, [[ASIN:0615240305 Phineas Parkhurst Quimby]], other early movers like Warren Felt Evans and Emma Curtis Hopkins as well as various denominations like [[ASIN:054812440X Divine Science]], Unity, Science of Mind or [[ASIN:1558747362 Religious Science]] and other groups.<br /><br />The religious background and development of New Thought is dealt with in chapters three and four. Mysticism, healing, spirituality and the significance of the Christ are also explored in these chapters. The similarities and very profound differences between New Age and New Thought are investigated next. One of the main differences is that New Thought is in essence [[ASIN:1604244720 Christian]], and it does not have an interest in the occult.<br /><br />Process theology is introduced in chapter six. This is a welcome new way to look at the belief system, based on the insights of that great philosopher and theologian [[ASIN:0823216462 Alfred North Whitehead]]. This section also looks at the Christian, Modern and [[ASIN:1592476422 Postmodern]] worldviews and alternatives to postmodernism in the form of primordialism or perennialism. Further fascinating topics here include personalism, panentheism, and the role of law.<br /><br />The authors make a convincing case for the personhood of God as against the idea of Active Law and they introduce the concept of Process New Thought, as against the old Substance New Thought. A table provides a list of contrasts between Old Christian Thought, Substance New Thought and Process New Thought.<br /><br />The practical application of New Thought is investigated in chapters seven and eight. This section includes an answer to the critics plus matters such as depression, economics, and support for New Thought from [[ASIN:0802832717 psychology]]. Specific practices and techniques are discussed, and chapter eight provides a useful list of affirmations. The authors' [[ASIN:158820264X Practicing the Presence of God for Practical Purposes]] covers the practical application in greater detail.<br /><br />Anderson and Whitehouse make a valuable original contribution to the future evolution of New Thought in this engrossing book. Their work is both informative and inspirational and places New Thought and its applications in historical and philosophical perspective. It concludes with an extensive bibliography and a biographical note on the authors. I highly recommend this book to people interested in spirituality and those with a sincere desire to improve their lives.The practical application of New Thought is investigated in chapters seven and eight.

The work is based on historical research by eminent research historians and underwater archaeologists that enabled the author to piece together a more accurate narrative of the events.<br /><br />Whiting writes about the preparations of the Spanish, the counter-moves of the English, the battles and the aftermath. The story includes Drake's daring raid on Lisbon where he destroyed 30 ships and captured 6. The author believes that Philip, the king of Spain, wanted to intimidate rather than conquer England and also points out that England was by no means defenceless .<br /><br />Whiting paints a sympathetic picture of the ill-fated Duke of Medina Sedonia and the beloved Elizabeth, queen of England. Elizabeth's loving letter to her people provides some of the most poignant moments in the book.<br /><br />Appendix A is a Comparison of Santa Cruz's 1586 estimate for an Armada with the Armada which sailed in 1588. Appendices B and C provide the Composition of the Armada and Spanish Loses. The book concludes with a bibliography and an index. It is a vivid and highly readable historical narrative.	2004-10-10

The cultivation of and trade in these plants created enormous wealth and changed the history of the world in many ways.<br /><br />The chapter on timber is titled The Essential Carpet. In it, Hobhouse discusses how the shortage of timber in the United Kingdom led to the use of coal, which led to scientific advances and ultimately to the industrial revolution. On the other hand, the abundance of timber in the USA spurred the westward march of the country during the 1800s.<br /><br />In The Grape's Bid For Immortality, the author discusses the growing of vines and making of wine from 600BC to the present. Wine has an enormous potential for the creation of wealth, multiplying nett profits wherever it is successful.<br /><br />In the chapter Wheels Shod For Speed, he tells the story of rubber and how it changed the economies of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and indeed the world. More Than A Smoke is a fascinating account of how the colony and ultimately state of Virginia owes it wealth to tobacco. Initially this area had a monopoly on tobacco by decree of the king of England. This industry created a landlord class, which amongst them counted certain signatories of the Declaration of Independence, like Washington and Jefferson.<br /><br />The book is full of fascinating facts and observations, for example that the original alkaline tobacco might not be harmful and that the acidity of modern cigarettes might be the root cause of the harmful effects of smoking on health.<br /><br />Seeds Of Health is a truly engrossing book as it deals with politics, economics, global history and more particularly Anglo-American relations, and the role of nature in creating wealth and economic growth.

The drive to synchronization is one of the most far-reaching phenomena in the universe, encompassing people, planets, atoms, animals and a whole lot more. But the laws of Thermodynamics seem to dictate the opposite - that nature should degenerate toward entropy. This is not so, as magnificent small and large structures like galaxies and cells keep assembling themselves in perfect harmony.<br /><br />Drawing on Chaos & Complexity Theory, Strogatz examines the connections linking the phenomena of the mathematics of self-organization, where trillions of interactions result in order emerging from chaos. There is a steady and insistent pulse at the heart of the cosmos that resonates from the nucleus of the cell to the largest galaxy in a chorus of synchronized cycles that pervade all of nature.<br /><br />The author refers to the work of scientists from many disciplines, including Einstein, Richard Feynman, Brian Josephson, Norbert Wiener, Paul Erdos, Stanley Milgram, Boris Belousov Edward Lorenz and Arthur Winfree. Part One, Living In Sync, deals with these manifestations in for example human brainwaves and the behaviour of fireflies, whilst Part Two, Discovering Sync, looks at the universe as a whole and at quantum theory. Part Three, Exploring Sync, investigates synchronization, chaos and small world networks.<br /><br />There are some black and white illustrations, copious notes and an index. This book is a fascinating journey through the strange and beautiful phenomenon of synchronization, the harmonious music of the universe that builds and sustains life.	2004-09-28

It investigates the concept of emergence and considers fresh angles of looking at the world, at increasing complexity and at consciousness. The idea of emergence provides clues as to how novelty occurs.<br /><br />The author chose 28 topics to consider, 28 moments of emergence in the history of the universe. Amongst the questions and phenomena discussed are the following: Why is there something rather than nothing? The non-uniformity of the universe, the emergence of stars, the periodic table, the solar system, planetary structure, geospheres, metabolism, cells, the neuron, animalness, hominization, toolmaking, language, agriculture, the worldviews of Athens and of Jerusalem, science and religion.<br /><br />The point is to use history in order to study emergence, which can generate beliefs. Emergence has a divine aspect, the Word (Immanence) that becomes flesh (Transcendence). By looking at the work of Spinoza, Einstein and others, the author concludes that our evolving minds are the transcendence of the immanent God.<br /><br />The book provides stimulating thoughts and is an engaging read. Although firmly rooted in pantheism his views are very valuable and interesting. To this reviewer, however, pantheism is limiting for a variety of reasons. Further to this I would like to refer the reader to the idea of panentheism as it manifests in the works of Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Krause, Dean Inge and especially Alfred North Whitehead, in particular the last mentioned's magnificent book [[ASIN:B000GPXJXY Process and Reality: An Essay in cosmology]].	2004-09-28

New Thought, called \\"the religion of healthy-mindedness\\" by William James, had remained fairly static in a pantheistic mould after its beginnings in the 19th century. This book provides a new conceptual foundation for the movement, based on the process theology of the great Alfred North Whitehead. It is very refreshing, in that the authors see pantheism (God is All) as an early aberration within New Thought, replacing it with panentheism (All is in God) of a process perspective.<br /><br />The book takes up the words of the title one by one to demonstrate how they work together to bring us health, wealth and a more fulfilling life. The journey starts out with the Christian mystic Brother Lawrence Of The Resurrection and as it proceeds, it discusses an impressive variety of writers like e.g. Stephen Covey, Marianne Williamson, C S Lewis, Emmett Fox, Robert Dilts, Marjorie Suchocki, W R Inge, Aldous Huxley, Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Krause, John Cobb, David Griffin, Ernest Holmes, Andrew Weil, Catherine Ponder, Phil Laut, Robert Anthony, Wallace Wattles, Leo Booth and Whitehead.<br /><br />Chapter One: Our Story Begins, looks at the ancient roots of New Thought, its founder Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, some of its great proponents in the 19th century like Emma Curtis Hopkins and Malinda Cramer and also discusses Steven Covey's by now famous Seven Habits. Part Two: Practicing, revisits Covey's seven principles and habits in more detail and then provides practical ways to alter one's beliefs and to attain a state of constant communication with God.<br /><br />Part Three: The Presence Of God, explains the word metaphysics and considers the bursts of energy that quantum physicists call quanta and that Whitehead calls \\"occasions of experience.\\" One of the most illuminating parts of the book explains why God must be a person and how the individual functions with God as a cocreative team. This may be expressed as the formula: Past + Divine Possibilities + Choice = Cocreation.<br /><br />Part Four: Practical Purposes, provides the ways in which we can apply our practice of the presence to the task of building health, wealth and happiness. These include affirmative prayer, diet, exercise, visualization, holding positive thoughts and cultivating one's intuition for messages from God. Part Five: The Black Hole, discusses sin, evil, grief, illness, financial challenges, relationship difficulties, feelings, cults and toxic religion, and adulthood. It emphasizes the importance of blending the head and heart (intellectual agreement and emotional resonance).<br /><br />Finally, the book explains the difference between New Age and New Thought by reiterating that the good news of New Thought was not an attempt to replace Christianity but instead to heighten the understanding of Christians by restoring the heart of the East to the mind of the West.<br /><br />The book is a delightful read, full of humour and common sense. The application of Whitehead's ideas of life and consciousness (new every moment) makes perfect sense to me. It also finally lays the pantheistic idea of an impersonal deity to rest, a concept which has been a stumbling block for those of us who practiced faithfully but desired a closer relationship with God.<br /><br />Practicing The Presence Of God is not a practical guide with ready-made affirmations and visualizations, but rather an explanatory text that covers the ideas behind all of the aforementioned and more. Its greatest benefit for me exists in its convincing argument for God as a limitless person rather than a set of laws. As such, I found it to be highly enlightening and inspirational.ed as the formula: Past + Divine Possibilities + Choice = Cocreation.<br /><br />Part Four: Practical Purposes, provides the ways in which we can apply our practice of the presence to the task of building health, wealth and happiness.

The article was filled with non sequiturs and nonsensical quotations about maths and physics by prominent French and American intellectuals, yet it was published unaltered.  Sokal then revealed that it was a deliberate parody, to the great consternation of the editors.<br /><br />Intellectual Impostures broadens the investigation to demonstrate how intellectuals such as Lacan, Kristeva, Irigaray, Baudrillard, Deleuze and Guattari have repeatedly abused scientific concepts and terminology. They have either used these ideas completely out of context without justification or they have thrown scientific jargon around with no regard for its meaning or relevance, obviously to try to impress their readers.<br /><br />In the preface to the first edition, Sokal and Bricmont provide the background to the controversy whilst in the preface to the second edition they discuss the four types of criticisms of their book. These are: critics who tried to refute them, critics who attributed to them ideas that the authors themselves had rejected, name-calling and ad hominem attacks, and finally those who agreed but thought that the authors did not go far enough.<br /><br />Here one is tempted to partly agree with Anne Applebaum who, in her review of the book, claimed that of course post-structuralist theory is rubbish and that we don't need a book to tell us that. I disagree with the second statement, because Intellectual Impostures is mostly an amusing read that will have you rolling on the floor and because it is vitally important that intellectual frauds be exposed. In this regard I also highly recommend The Illusions Of Postmodernism by Terry Eagleton and The Anti Chomsky reader by David Horowitz and Peter Collier.<br /><br />The introduction provides the history of the Sokal Hoax and the response to it. The major part of the book consists of an analysis of various texts by Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Bruno Latour, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and Paul Virilio. Brief explanations of the relevant scientific concepts plus references to popular and explanatory texts are provided.  The authors also investigate certain philosophical and scientific confusions behind much of postmodernist thinking, like cognitive relativism, certain misunderstandings concerning chaos theory and so-called postmodern science.<br /><br />Appendix A is the full text of the famous hoax article: Trangressing The Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity.

Chapter One: cold war reflections, touches on many subjects from the information revolution to the victory of the West in the cold war. Chapter Two looks at the American achievement including the concept of a unipolar world, military preparedness, defence technologies and missile defence.<br /><br />Chapter Three deals with Russia, the legacy of communism, the role of the IMF, the failed economic reforms, the country's relations with its former Soviet colonies and what remains of its military power. Part One of Chapter Four explains why Asia, with half of the world's population and a third of all dry land, matters so much.  Part Two deals with the Tigers: Singapore, South Korea and Indonesia, whilst Part Three is devoted to Japan. The next chapter, Asian Giants, deals with China (including Taiwan and Hong Kong) and India.<br /><br />In Chapter Six, rogue states, religion and terrorism are discussed, with particular reference to North Korea, Islam, Iraq, Syria, Lybia and Iran. In Chapter Seven, Thatcher discusses human rights, genocide, the Yugoslavia and Rwanda criminal tribunals, the international criminal court and European court of human rights.<br /><br />Chapter Eight investigates the Balkan wars whilst Chapter Nine is devoted to the European Union. Thatcher investigates the roots of the European idea, the European economic and social model, the pensions crisis, the common agricultural policy, the Euro currency as a means towards a superstate and the bureaucratic, anti-democratic nature of the EU.<br /><br />Thatcher warns against the creeping loss of sovereignty to unaccountable EU bureaucrats who have only contempt for democracy. The next chapter looks at the current situation of the UK by investigating all the options of how her country might extricate itself from this mess. She advises Britain to stick to the Pound and to renegotiate the structure of the EU.<br /><br />The last chapter strikes a devastating blow to the critics of capitalism by illustrating how well the free economies have been performing as opposed to the shackled economies of the remaining authoritarian regimes. She also dissects the absurdities of the global warming scare and discusses globalism and its enemies.<br /><br />The postscript deals with accountability and the Magna Carta in a delightful description of Thatcher and her husband's visit to the memorial at Runnymede.

Guest takes into account factors like for example climate and history, whilst quoting African writers like Chinua Achebe, Themba Sono and Chenjerai Hove.<br /><br />Amidst all the despair, the text often highlights rays of hope so the book is not a relentless tale of woe. Guest identifies issues like tribalism and corruption and the waste of aid money while pointing out positive developments in places like Botswana, South Africa, Uganda and Senegal.<br /><br />The author examines the good results in countries that follow sound fiscal and monetary policies as opposed to the vampire state in places like Zimbabwe or the failed state in e.g. Congo (Zaire). A very important point that Guest makes is that Africa can develop and improve the lives of its people without sacrificing its culture. Japan is proof enough that modernity does not necessarily threaten an indigenous culture.<br /><br />He discusses Rwanda's holocaust and religious clashes in Nigeria, takes a balanced look at South Africa's successes and its failures like its lack of an AIDS policy and criticises western countries for their agricultural protectionism. Apparently Africa has already received the equivalent of six Marshall Plans in aid and in some places mineral wealth has been more of a curse than a blessing.<br /><br />Guest makes a plea for increased trade and praises the stability that exists in those countries where property rights are respected. He also surveys the situation of the media, where both oppression and lack of money are impediments to a free press. The book ends on an optimistic note with the example of a young man in the KwaZulu province of South Africa having become a successful businessman after abandoning a life of violence.<br /><br />The book concludes with bibliographic notes and an index. The Shackled Continent can be heartbreaking at times, but the overall tone is optimistic, and realistically so. The book leaves an impression of hope and the reader can only pray that good government may soon come to Africa. The poignant title of South Africa's national anthem by Enoch Sontonga, says it all: \\"Nkosi sikelele i'Afrika\\", meaning God bless Africa., but the overall tone is optimistic, and realistically so.

It is filled with interesting information on the authors, the books and the literary concerns of a century.<br /><br />The TLS was founded in 1902; editor Bruce Richmond established its position as the foremost literary/intellectual publication for English literary discourse in the years 1903 to 1937. Richmond believed that the TLS was for keen general readers and that its role was to help readers find the most worthwhile books.<br /><br />Not all of its editors were drawn from Oxbridge circles, since Stanley Morrison (1945 - 1947) started out as typesetter, whilst Arthur Crook (1959 - 1974) began his career as a postal clerk. With some notable exceptions, the talents of gifted writers were recognized early by the TLS: Philip Larkin, Graham Greene, Saul Bellow and Proust.<br /><br />The delicious polemics always added spice to the pages of TLS and the reader can get lost in the obscure and famous quarrels and outrageous observations of a variety of colourful literary figures. One hundred years of books, authors, editors and literary squabbles, who could ask for more? Critical Times is a landmark of English literary history and a must-have reference work.	2004-08-24

He attempts to bridge the gap between the humanities/social sciences and the traditional idea of science as it finds expression in the natural sciences like astronomy, physics, geology etc.<br /><br />The title refers to hedgehogs that establish themselves so successfully in a particular field that they can forever keep their competitors at a distance, and to foxes that in their turn spread the seed of knowledge through their genius and versatility. The fox and the hedgehog are the models of how the sciences and humanities should interact, because Gould believed that neither single strategy would work.<br /><br />But a fruitful merger of these seemingly polar opposites could, with the necessary goodwill and restraint, be conjoined into a diverse but common enterprise of power and unity. The book is a plea for increased understanding between the humanities and the natural sciences.<br /><br />He encourages natural scientists to improve their communication skills and to read beyond their field of specialty, and he criticizes those in the humanities who have no knowledge or understanding of the natural sciences. This can lead to the embarrassing stupidities so well documented in the book Intellectual Impostures (Fashionable Nonsense) by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont.<br /><br />The Hedgehog, the Fox and the Magister's Pox is an engaging text and a stimulating read. It is accessible enough for the general reader and although not considered an example of his best writing, definitely worth a read.	2004-08-24

For him, postmodernism is a style of culture reflecting something of the epochal changes during the historical phase of postmodernity. He explores the culture and milieu of postmodernist philosophy as a whole and does not much discuss particular works of art or specific theorists. Eagleton's approach is to look at what a student today might believe about postmodernism and to prove that most of that is false. Although his view is mainly negative, he judges both postmodernism's strengths and its failures from a broadly socialist political and theoretical perspective.<br /><br />The book draws extensively on the author's writings in the London Review Of Books, Times Literary Supplement, Monthly Review, Textual Practice and Socialist Register and is divided into the chapters Beginnings, Ambivalences, Histories, Subjects, Fallacies and Contradictions. Eagleton's sense of irony and gift of satire ensure an engaging text, especially when he comes up with turns of phrase like: \\" ... from Lyotard to leotards ...\\". He also touches on subjects are disparate as Madonna, graphic novels and gothic architecture, which enliven the text.<br /><br />Eagleton considers the politics of postmodernism to have been both enrichment and evasion. For all its supposed openness, Pomo can be just as censorious and exclusivist as the orthodoxies it opposes. He explains that it is a type of orthodox heterodoxy that needs its straw men in order to stay in business. In its attempt to cut the ground from under its opponents' feet, Pomo unavoidably pulls the rug from under its own. He explores pomo's hatred of [[ASIN:156663430X essentialism]] (the specific \\"whatness\\" of a thing) and concludes that if enlightenment universalism is exclusivist in practice, ethnic particularism can be exclusivist in both practice and theory.<br /><br />Eagleton concludes that pomo is not just some theoretical mistake. It is the ideology of a particular historical epoch in the West when reviled and humiliated groups discovered something of their history and selfhood. But its inherent failings are its cultural relativism, moral conventionalism, cynicism, localism and lack of any adequate theory of political agency. As such, he concludes that postmodernism cannot confront authoritarian ideologies.<br /><br />In simple parlance, pomo thought with its relativism denies distinctions between right and wrong or good and evil, whilst claiming that everything is just a power game and we are all victims. It in fact provides a fertile breeding ground for fascism, something that Eagleton is perhaps too polite to spell out. But his thoughts have broadened my perspective on this jargon-jaded phenomenon, all thanks to his elegant prose and intellectual acuity.<br /><br />The book concludes with notes and an index. I also recommend [[ASIN:1861976313 Intellectual Impostures]] (Fashionable Nonsense) by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, an investigation of how postmodernist theorists twist and abuse the language of the natural sciences.

The author first looks at the problem of depression by discussing the biochemistry of the brain and the relationship between mental and physical health.<br /><br />St John's Wort (hypericum) offers a gentle way of treating depression and other nervous disorders. Cass discusses the scientific proof of the efficacy of this herb as measured against synthetic antidepressants. The research is indeed encouraging and the plant's mild side effects provide a great advantage over the synthetic medicines.<br /><br />The author explores the correct dosage for various problems like sleep and seasonal affective disorders (SADs) whilst pointing out the herb's anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and immune enhancing properties. Besides the well-known hypericin, St John's Wort also contains a host of other phytochemicals that play vital roles in protecting cells from damage, in repairing damage and in regeneration.<br /><br />These ingredients include GABA, carotenoids, flavonoids, hyperforin, limonene, lutein, phytosterols, quercetin, quercetrin, rutin and xanthones.  All parts of the plant, the flowers, leaves, stem and the oil are used in healing. One of the possible side effects of taking St John's Wort is sensitivity to the sun in certain people.<br /><br />The book includes a bibliography, a natural medicine resources list, a protocol for switching a patient from an anti-depressant to St John's Wort and the regulatory status of St John's Wort in various countries. It concludes with an index. I also recommend Mind Boosters by Ray Sahelian and The A to Z Guide to Supplements by Phyllis A Balch for further information on herbal medicines.	2004-08-14

The thoughts and ideas are drawn from his books, articles, unpublished writings, newspaper interviews and excerpts from TV/radio shows.<br /><br />Wilde believes that life was mean to be enjoyed and his writings are dedicated to the rapid and complete liberation of the individual from negative thoughts and emotions and the daily grind. The main themes revolve around how to remain balanced and detached, how to increase one's perception, act powerfully, concentrate on what is real and believe in oneself.<br /><br />In the short entries of mostly one page each that are not arranged alphabetically, Wilde holds forth on subjects like dedication, perseverance, opportunity, dimensions, concentration, relationships, time, energy, opposites, sacrifice, confidence, serenity, service, creativity, and, with a refreshing libertarian approach, on stuff like government and politics.<br /><br />His humorous and engaging style inspires optimism. In isolation, however, not all of these thoughts always make sense: some appear as truisms and some may be wide open to interpretation without a context. But even when one disagrees with him, his ideas often raise a smile. The Secrets Of Life is enhanced by beautiful black and white illustrations by Stephen Smith. It is a handy inspirational guide to his thoughts that I recommend to those who are already fans of Wilde.<br /><br />His popular books like Affirmations, The Force and The Quickening provide a wider understanding and proper context of the insights that he manages to convey with so much wit and elegance and would be more suitable for those readers wishing to investigate his work for the first time.	2004-08-14

On the physical side, it shows promise against viral infections and is a proven wound and tissue healer and has been used as such in homeopathy.<br /><br />The author also discusses its role in the treatment of HIV and the use of Hypericum in combination with other herbal medicines. A very interesting part is Chevallier's consideration of St John's Wort in history, folk medicine and in Western herbal medicine. It is interesting that the folklore surrounding garlic and St John's Wort, as protectors against evil, has been borne out by modern science.<br /><br />Detailed dosage and information on preparations are provided and the book concludes with bibliographic references. There are black and white illustrations of the plant and of the molecular structure of its active ingredients. A great source for information on a wide variety of natural supplements that enhance the mind, memory and mood is Dr Ray Sahelian's book Mind Boosters. I also recommend Earl Mindell's Herb Bible for more information on St John's Wort and other natural anti-depressants and healing herbs.	2004-08-14

As advisor to King Th&eacute;oden of Rohan, he was an undercover agent of the evil wizard Saruman that poisoned and enfeebled the king's mind with his mendacious council while supplying the wizard with intelligence on the military situation in Rohan at this time of great peril for Middle Earth.<br /><br />This figure from literature resembles Noam Chomsky as one who has attained a seemingly occult grip on the minds of his followers by calling good evil, and evil good. It is truly disturbing that such an intellectual fraud and hater of the truth should still be taken seriously by any informed and rational person; his dedicated following is easier to understand as a religious cult. By the law of attraction, Chomsky's hatred obviously resonates with many of the alienated and the disaffected.<br /><br />The chapter Partners In Hate by Werner Cohn is particularly revealing. This meticulously documented article exposes Chomsky's collaboration with neo-Nazi groups and individuals in France and examines this in the light of Chomsky's poisonous and rabid loathing of Israel. What is revealed here leaves one with a peculiar blend of revulsion, amazement and a certain chilling recognition.<br /><br />The recognition is of the significant fact that hatred of the Jews has always existed among all nations and on all sides of the political spectrum, particularly in collectivist ideologies like extreme Nationalism, National Socialism and Communism. Nowadays it is becoming more prevalent amongst the Left in the USA whilst in Europe it seems to have infested a large segment of the political and media elites especially in France. Paul Bogdanor looks at Chomsky's war against Israel in his well-researched essay of that title.<br /><br />Many explanations have been offered, like the emotion of envy because where ever they have enjoyed freedom, Jewish people have always excelled and have bestowed many blessings upon humanity, far out of proportion to their small numbers. A related view is that the cosmopolitan Jew threatened the idea of the nationalistic nation state. There is merit in all these, but a nagging suspicion remains that anti-Semitism might be rooted in something even more evil, something perhaps best left in the metaphysical realm. Please read [[ASIN:0787978035 The New Anti-Semitism: The Current Crisis and What We Must Do About It]] by Phyllis Chesler to see how this vile hatred is spreading again.<br /><br />There are those who deplore Chomsky's politics but hold his work as linguist in high esteem. The linguists Paul Postal and Robert Levine point out that his linguistic contribution is based on the same grotesque incoherence and contempt for truth and scientific standards as his political rants. This is in fact quite an amusing chapter and reminded me of that brilliant criticism of post-modernist abuse of the terminology of the natural sciences by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, titled [[ASIN:1861976313 Intellectual Impostures]] (Fashionable Nonsense).<br /><br />Steven J Morris examines Chomsky's cunning propaganda in the Vietnam era whilst Anders Lewis discusses his romanticising of the third world and the chomskyan vision of Hanoi as the \\"shining city on the hill.\\" Chomsky's vicious attacks against the witnesses of the Cambodian holocaust in the 1970s are equally revealing, since many of these witnesses were Leftists. This must have opened at least some eyes at the time.<br /><br />The part of this book that I personally enjoyed the most, is Thomas Nichols in his essay Chomsky And The Cold War describing Chomsky's rage when the Wall came down, communism imploded and the USSR fell apart. So much for my personal Schadenfreude ...<br /><br />The book also deals with Chomsky's Schadenfreude after the 9/11 atrocities and explores his role as the Pope of Anti-Americanism. And by Jove, it all becomes clear. I had often wondered about the particularly juvenile quality of anti-Americanism, but a look at Chomsky's lunatic ravings makes it all very obvious. It also becomes clearer why individuals of a certain disposition would enthusiastically embrace this. It's an emotional thing, you see.<br /><br />In this regard I highly recommend the illuminating book [[ASIN:159403060X Anti-Americanism]] (L'obsession anti-americaine) by the French intellectual Jean-François Revel. The work of other French thinkers like Alain Finkielkraut and Andr&eacute; Glucksmann is also worth consulting on this subject. I am thinking especially of Glucksmann's comments on the type of nihilism currently at large in the world. The focal point of this hatred is Israel and America. Many decades ago [[ASIN:0451147952 Ayn Rand]] described it well: Hatred of the good for being the good.<br /><br />Peter Collier and David Horowitz have done a splendid job in compiling and contributing to the Anti-Chomsky Reader. I suspect that serious thinkers on the rational and decent Left are aware of his mendacity but Chomsky's intellectual poison is still spreading around the world and needed a thorough debunking. Although exposed many times before (exceptionally well by Christopher Hitchens), his lies have wide emotional appeal. To each their own, but one cannot but wonder whether his followers will ultimately benefit or suffer from this brainwashing. The book [[ASIN:1400052947 The Death of Right and Wrong: Exposing the Left's Assault on Our Culture and Values]] by Tammy Bruce provides a chilling picture of the intellectual elites on the Looney Left.<br /><br />What happened to Grima Wormtongue? After the War of the Rings, Saruman tried to take revenge on the Hobbits in the Shire, accompanied by the grovelling Wormtongue. But the Hobbits overcame them and Wormtongue killed Saruman out of revenge for his harsh treatment of him. The Hobbits then finished off Wormtongue.<br /><br />In David Day's book, [[ASIN:0517120771 Tolkien Bestiary]], Saruman's death is described in detail. First his body shrivelled to skin, skull and bones in his cloak whereafter a grey mist arose from it. For a moment, a spectral form hovered over the remains. Then it was blown away by a gust of wind. May it be so with Chomsky's falsehoods and distortions, his hatred of America and Israel, and his adoration of dictators and genocidal ideologies.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385511841 Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0742552276 The Resurgence of Anti-Semitism: Jews, Israel, and Liberal Opinion (Philosophy and the Global Context)]]look at Chomsky's lunatic ravings makes it all very obvious.

Whereas most of the early New Thought metaphysicians like Thomas Troward & Emmet Fox wrote in the mystical tradition, Atkinson engages mental phenomena from an angle where natural science meets psychology. His analyses are convincing, especially when measured against the blood-soaked history of the century that was then in its infancy.<br /><br />He starts out with the law of vibration by first demolishing the tenets of scientific materialism and then by comparing consciousness to scientific theories of vibration with analogy to sight and sound. Argueing that the study of consciousness belongs in the realm of physical science rather than in metaphysics, Atkinson quotes some of the scientists of his day on the massive gaps between vibrationary rates, inaudible sounds & invisible light.<br /><br />There are 'atmospheres' that appear to inhabit places; these may be impossible to measure but the anecdotal evidence is overwhelming. The two main factors in the manifestation of mental influence are concentration and visualization/mental imaging, both of which the author explores in detail. He discusses the two general forms of the use of mental influence that he calls \\"fascination\\" and \\"hypnotism.\\" Influencing at a distance, as in the practice of [[ASIN:089281313X distance healing]], is also dealt with.<br /><br />Atkinson shows how advertising and sales techniques draw upon ancient knowledge of thought transference. The chapter on mass influencing describes how ideas and beliefs rapidly spread amongst large sectors of a population. He then shows how vitally important it is for the individual to be resistant or at least aware of the various currents of ideas prevalent at any given time. This advice is more pertinent than ever in our age of ubiquitous [[ASIN:1594032122 mass media]].<br /><br />His insight is timeless. Considering that his writing dates from 1908 before the slaughters of the 20th century had started, many of his ideas proved prophetic. Since then, quantum physics has confirmed the legitimacy of his insights, e.g. that everything is energy. As mentioned before, Atkinson takes a practical approach to explaining the mechanics of thought power and thus appears to lean to the occult side of the esoteric more than the mystical. I do not mean this in a negative way, as his moral psychology is based on the best in the Western tradition. He was certainly an advocate of what [[ASIN:1602067279 William James]] called The Religion of Healthy Mindedness.<br /><br />Atkinson's contributions are particularly valuable in explaining how [[ASIN:0394718747 susceptible]] the individual is to fashions, trends and thought patterns that spread around the globe. In order to remain immune to individual & mass mental influence, one has to rely on the Indwelling Presence or Higher Self for clarity & guidance. This is the only antidote against mental waves of feelings & emotions that sweep the public mind with the potential of \\"stampeding\\" people into adopting certain ideas or of following certain leaders.<br /><br />Who'd have thought that such alarming numbers of seemingly sane people would be swept up in crazy & contradictory [[ASIN:1932236465 conspiracy theories]] in the 21st century? Eric Hoffer's [[ASIN:0060505915 True Believer]] is a seminal study of mass movements, whilst the French intellectual Andr&eacute; Glucksmann has warned of a 'contagion of hatred', a concept that he insists ought to be taken literally. Atkinson reveals and illuminates those aspects of the phenomena that neither of them has articulated.<br /><br />Words have power. In order to raise awareness of the power within, prayers and protective chants/mantras exist in all the ancient traditions; some are specifically devoted to repel mental pathogens ('deliver us from evil'). In [[ASIN:0345431707 Sanskrit]], one such is theDurga mantra. Hebrew has the Elohai Neshama chant, based on the belief that the Nefesh (vital) & Ruach (movement) levels of the soul can be contaminated but that the life force level, [[ASIN:1591793440 Neshama]], cannot be stained as it is indivisible from the life source. This particular mantra simultaneously evokes compassion for all.<br /><br />These clear & concise explanations of the mental laws & processes at work in shaping public perception and opinion have particular relevance in times of turbulence when charismatic leaders tend to prey on panic by promoting their destructive ideologies. I highly recommend this thought-provoking book for a clear understanding of [[ASIN:1401923313 persuasion]], politics and how to immunize your mind, your most precious possession.on the belief that the Nefesh (vital) & Ruach (movement) levels of the soul can be contaminated but that the life force level, [[ASIN:1591793440 Neshama]], cannot be stained as it is indivisible from the life source.

In this, it partly succeeds although the text has its flaws. One of them is that the narrative sometimes breathlessly runs from one event to the next without properly examining their great import.<br /><br />Largely based on interviews for a TV series, the book quotes a huge variety of friends, colleagues, enemies and acquaintances throughout Maggie's life and political career. It includes all the highs and lows like the election victories, the Falklands War and the collapse of communism, without dwelling long enough on some of these.<br /><br />It is clear that her husband Denis Thatcher played a major role in her achievements; he was certainly the perfect partner. Both her victories and defeats and her admirable qualities and faults are described in an engaging way. Denis Thatcher's flashes of humour are delightful and must have made up for what Maggie lacked in this regard.<br /><br />As an admirer I came away from this book adoring her even more but perhaps also a bit wiser to her faults. The book whets one appetite for reading a more serious biography and for investigating Thatcher's own book titled Statecraft.<br /><br />The book concludes with notes to every chapter, a bibliography and a thorough index. There are plenty of black and white photographs, from when she was a little girl of four to the last poignant one when she leaves No. 10 Downing Street for the last time.<br /><br />Maggie: The First Lady falls somewhere between light reading and serious biography. Although not recommended for the serious student, I think the text contains enough meat to satisfy her fans and admirers.	2004-08-11

The book lists the idea, quality or state symbolised and then discusses all the major imagery used to represent it under the topic. Important symbols with multiple meanings therefore appear under various different topic headings, whilst related topics are sometimes grouped together.<br /><br />The book provides an overview of the various imagery used by different cultures that stand for concepts like happiness, joy, wisdom, goodness, evil, truth justice, freedom and salvation amongst others. The author claims that traditional imagery as a whole represents a relatively small spectrum of emotions and ideas that were seen as the keystones of civilisation, in order to emphasize the positive over the negative. The book includes many cross-references, an index and plenty of striking monotone and full colour illustrations.	2004-08-08

This practical guide looks at garlic as medicine and food and tells the reader how to include it in a self-care regimen.<br /><br />The book provides a brief history of garlic, investigates its potential, its role in heart disease, explains how garlic thins the blood and explores the plant's other actions. These include its role as an antibiotic. Although garlic has a slower and weaker effect than antibiotics, it has almost no side effects, does not create bacterial resistance and acts against a very wide range of organisms. It is thus perfect for use against chronic and less dangerous infections.<br /><br />Garlic is particularly effective against fungal and yeast infections and parasites, as its reactive sulphur compounds attack the invasive organisms without harming the body. The section on products and preparations considers garlic oil capsules, dried garlic powder and deodorised, aged garlic. The Further Reading section includes a list of books and selected scientific references on the specific properties of garlic. The book concludes with an index.	2004-07-31

With Lane's consent, Weaver retold her story in his own way, making use of her ideas but adding material from his personal experience and from various other sources.<br /><br />Part One: Comparisons and Contrasts, explores various puzzling questions of history and the concept of human energy. Part Two: The Old World Views, contrasts the fatalistic pagan outlook on life with the Judeo-Christian view of individual freedom and personal responsibility.<br /><br />Part Three: The Revolution, looks at mankind's three attempts to attain individual freedom: the ancient Israelites, the golden age of Islamic civilization, and the American Revolution. Part Four: The Fruits Of Freedom, investigates the results of freedom, including the flowering of inventive genius that followed. It also explores the concepts of hope versus fear, freedom of choice, the dynamic versus the static, the moral versus the material, voluntary co-operation and the lessons of history.<br /><br />The writing style is accessible and engaging and there are interesting quotes by people like Thomas Paine, Fredric Bastiat and Isabel Paterson. In an interesting way, the book illuminates many problems still plaguing the world today and traces them back to the ancient conflict between pagan fatalism and the principles of the Judeo-Christian tradition.<br /><br />Of course there are non-religious philosophies of freedom that are based on reason alone, and the aforementioned Paine was a theist who was opposed to dogmatic religion. But whether one agrees with all of Weaver's points or not, The Mainspring Of Human Progress is a classic that remains an eloquent defence of the principle of individual freedom. The book concludes with a list of references, a bibliography and an index.<br /><br />On the subject of individual freedom, I also recommend the work of Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Karl Popper, Alfred North Whitehead, Ayn Rand, Stefan Hoeller, Robert Nozick, Milton Friedman and Johan Norberg.Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Karl Popper, Alfred North Whitehead, Ayn Rand, Stefan Hoeller, Robert Nozick, Milton Friedman and Johan Norberg. <br />	2004-07-25

The scientific investigation is based upon interviews and experiments with people who consider themselves lucky; the author concludes that luck is a state of mind that may be cultivated.<br /><br />Wiseman identifies four principles that underlie a life of good fortune, adherence to which will draw good luck into the life of the individual. These are 1. The belief that you are lucky (lucky people create, notice and act upon chance opportunities. They also have a relaxed attitude to life). 2. Lucky people make success happen by using their intuition and gut feelings. 3. One must expect good fortune, hold fast to this belief and persevere in attempting to achieve your goals. 4. Lucky people have a knack for transforming back luck into good luck. One must affirm your good fortune and have a strong conviction that everything will work out for the best.<br /><br />The text is illustrated by graphs illustrating the research results plus some black and white illustrations of playing cards. Overall the conclusions are quite impressive and I find the results of the study very convincing. There are plenty of exercises and the book concludes with notes that include bibliographic references.

He explores the significance of the constellation Orion by investigating its importance in ancient Egypt, in other kingdoms of the Middle East and in esoteric knowledge.<br /><br /> The astrology that he investigates has nothing to do with the occult or the real or imagined influence of the stars on our lives, but instead with the cycles of time and how they are recognizable in the positions of the constellations. The keys to the ancient wisdom are found in astronomy, archaeology, the harmonics of proportion, numerology and astrology.<br /><br /> Gilbert describes the insights he gained over about three decades that included visits to Egypt, Israel and Turkey. He looks again at the pyramids as chronometers of the Bible and by considering the work of pioneers like Charles Piazzi Smyth and contemporary authors like Robert Bauval and Graham Hancock.<br /><br /> He makes extensive use of the SKYGLOBE computer programme for establishing the position of the constellations at the time of Jesus life and death, which he puts at 29AD. The figure of Orion corresponds closely with the concept of the cosmic Adam as found in the Kabala. Gilbert maintains that the Giza plateau is a map of time, of the present age of Adam.<br /><br /> He identifies Orion as the main symbol for the &quot;Son of man in heaven,&quot; and this a key that unlocks further prophecies in the Books of Revelation and Daniel. He integrates these discoveries with descriptions of his visits to Jerusalem, the Temple Mount and the Mount of Olives.<br /><br /> Gilbert also takes into consideration the geology of the Holy Land and the major changes that might come about if there were a major earthquake. The Mayan calendar date of 2012 is also dealt with in the light of his discoveries, in particular the mystical marriage in heaven that will take place that year between Orion and the planet Venus.<br /><br /> I think Signs In The Sky is a book of great significance. I found some parts too technical in his detailed explanation of measurements, geometry and astronomical calculations, but I suppose the detail is important in making his points. The book concludes with four appendices: The Architectural Gnosis, A Chronology In The Stars, The Lion Of God and The True Date For Easter And The Fatima Letters.<br /><br /> There are also extensive notes, a bibliography and an index. The text is enhanced by black and white maps, illustrations and stellar signatures, whilst the 33 beautiful color plates include photographs of the pyramids, the Sphinx, the Wailing Wall, Dome of the Rock, the Mount of Olives and a beautiful esoteric painting, Opening The Stargate: 29th June 2000, in which the spirit of Orion as the Alpha and the Omega instructs St John as he writes the Book of Revelation.that will take place that year between Orion and the planet Venus. <br />  <br /> I think Signs In The Sky is a book of great significance.

He explains how this science fits into the larger scheme of scientific progress and what it tells us about the world in our connected age. The book really covers two narratives: The history and development of the science of networks itself, plus the manifestation of network phenomena in the real world.<br /><br />Chapters 2 to 5 investigate real world networks, chapters 3 to 5 consider the creation and implication of various models of networked systems, whilst chapters six (Epidemics and Failures), seven (Decisions, Delusions and the Madness of Crowds), eight (Thresholds, Cascades and Predictability) and nine (Innovation, Adaptation and Recovery) explore the spread of diseases, recovery, fads, politics, finance and organizational strength.<br /><br />Some of the lessons of this thought-provoking book are that distance is deceptive and that in connected systems, cause and effect are related in complicated and sometimes misleading ways. In the latter regard, Watts discusses the many initial rejections that Kerouac's later very popular classic On The Road had to endure and the similar case of Rowling's first Harry Potter book.<br /><br />The Further Reading section is arranged by chapter and provides recommendations of websites and books on that particular topic. The text contains tables, figures and some black and white illustrations and the book concludes with a bibliography and index. [[ASIN:0385494726 The Hidden Connections: A Science for Sustainable Living]] by Fritjof Capra and [[ASIN:0393324427 Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Theory of Networks]] by Mark Buchanan are similar books that I have found to be interesting and informative in this regard.	2004-07-24

This section ends with a look at anti-Americanism in academia and the anti-conceptual methodology in the education system.<br />Part Three: Politics, explores various political issues like antitrust legislation, foreign aid, socialized medicine, women in politics and includes a scathing attack on the political movement called Libertarianism. The epilogue is the editor's memoirs of his 30 year association with Ayn Rand.<br />Each chapter begins with information indicating the original source of the article or lecture. In some instances there are references in brackets within the text itself or otherwise they appear as numbered footnotes at the end.<br />In my opinion, the best pieces are The Sanction Of The Victim (Chapter 15), Apollo 11 (Chapter 17), Assault From the Ivory Tower: The Professors' War Against America (Chapter 19), Medicine: The Death Of A Profession (Chapter 30), while the worst is About A Woman President (Chapter 26) in which Rand claims that the office is no place for a woman. Perhaps Ayn Rand would have changed her mind had she lived long enough to witness the achievements of Margaret Thatcher.<br />Whether one agrees with her philosophy or nor, Rand was a brilliant writer and prescient and original thinker. All her work remains stimulating today and much of it now seems prophetic. Not all of these pieces are great but they are all worth reading.w seems prophetic.

In the foreword, Spiegl refers to previous anthologies like that of Andrews, Beable and Diprose and to the book The Epitaph Writer: Consisting of Upwards of Six Hundred Original Epitaphs, Moral, Admonitory, Humorous and Satirical by John Bowden.<br />The epitaphs appear on the right hand side with the location indicated (and sometimes a historical note or a quote from The Churchyards Handbook or the Bible) on the left hand page. They commence with that of Mrs Phoebe Crew of Norwich who as a midwife brought 9730 children into the world. To me the funniest one is \\"Here lies Jane Shore I say no more who was alive in Sixty-five,\\" an epitaph from Wrexham in Denbighshire. There are also some interesting anagrams.<br />Some epitaphs are witty, some are laugh out loud funny, but the book isn't all that serious about its subject I suspect. This small book of grave humour at least provides about an hour of amusement.	2004-07-14

It provides thousands of names, chart positions and facts but does not concern itself with songwriters, publishers and producers.<br />The decade was one of great diversity so that by the end of the period the charts contained bubblegum pop, MoR, mod revival music, new wave, ska, disco, heavy metal, soul and rock. This contrasted with the start of the 1970 when teen acts like Sweet, The Jackson 5, David Cassidy, The Osmonds and Slade ruled the airwaves.<br />In this decade, glam rock came and went, Bob Marley made his breakthrough, disco was big and pure pop in the form of Abba did very well. On the album charts, artists like ELP, Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, Camel, Yes, Van Morrison and The Moody Blues contributed some great music.<br />The punk and new wave explosion was the really big event in the rock world, with bands like The Sex Pistols, Ramones, The Clash and The Jam. There were also The Police, Gary Numan, a new wave of heavy metal and the Two Tone bands.<br />The book looks at the artists, the charts, the TV shows, small independent labels, the music press (NME, Sounds, Record Mirror, Melody Maker and others), the movies (from Abba - The Movie to Zachariah) and at different styles of music like reggae. A complete list of reggae songs that made the charts is provided.<br />The chapter on Radio deals with the stations, the DJs and the programmes.

The chapter titled Chart People lists every act that made the UK singles charts in that decade, the year of their first hit, number of hits, last chart hit of the decade and its highest position.<br />Next comes Chart Analysis of Artist Performance, which considers the decade in terms of its most successful singles artists. Thirty-nine groups and solo performers achieved ten or more hits. The top five are Elvis Presley (30), Elton John (25), Wings (23), David Bowie (22) and Cliff Richard (22).<br />The chapter titled Obituary provides information on the artists who died during the 1970s, from Louis Armstrong to Ronnie van Zant, whilst the next chapter, 1970s Gossip And News, traces some of the stories and events that coloured the news pages of pop on a month-by-month basis from January 1970 to December 1979.<br />The chapter Charts investigates the various UK charts of the 1970s, how they were compiled and discusses the changes that took place.

Consisting of medical doctors, pharmacists, pharmacologists and toxicologists, it was set up in 1978 to determine the efficacy and safety of herbs sold in Germany. This led to the approval of 254 herbs for medicinal use.<br />The main body of the work treats these alphabetically under the headings Potential Health Benefits, Scientific Evidence, How To Use The Herb, Consumer Products and Potential Dangers.

He explores the significance of the constellation Orion by investigating its importance in ancient Egypt, in other kingdoms of the Middle East and in esoteric knowledge.<br /><br />The astrology that he investigates has nothing to do with the occult or the real or imagined influence of the stars on our lives, but instead with the cycles of time and how they are recognizable in the positions of the constellations. The keys to the ancient wisdom are found in astronomy, archaeology, the harmonics of proportion, numerology and astrology.<br /><br />Gilbert describes the insights he gained over about three decades that included visits to Egypt, Israel and Edessa/Urfa, near the prehistoric monument G&ouml;bekli Tepe (Navel of the World) in Turkey. He looks again at the pyramids as chronometers of the Bible and by considering the work of pioneers like Charles Piazzi Smyth and contemporary authors like Robert Bauval and Graham Hancock.<br /><br />He makes extensive use of the SKYGLOBE computer programme for establishing the position of the constellations at significant moments in history. The figure of Orion corresponds closely with the concept of the Cosmic Adam as found in the Kabala. Gilbert maintains that the Giza plateau is a map of time, of the present age of Adam.<br /><br />He identifies Orion as the main symbol for the \\"Son of man in heaven,\\" and this a key that unlocks further prophecies in the scriptures, Daniel in particular. He integrates these discoveries with descriptions of his visits to Jerusalem, the Temple Mount and the Mount of Olives. Gilbert also takes into consideration the geology of the Holy Land and the major changes that might come about if there were a major earthquake.<br /><br />I think Signs In The Sky is a book of great significance. I found some parts too technical in his detailed explanation of measurements, geometry and astronomical calculations, but I suppose the detail is important in making his points. The book concludes with four appendices: The Architectural Gnosis, A Chronology In The Stars, The Lion Of God and The True Date For Easter And The Fatima Letters.<br /><br />There are also extensive notes, a bibliography and an index. The text is enhanced by black and white maps, illustrations and stellar signatures, whilst the 33 beautiful color plates include photographs of the pyramids, the Sphinx, the Western Wall, Dome of the Rock, Mount of Olives and an inspiring esoteric painting, Opening The Stargate: 29th June 2000, in which the spirit of Orion as the Alpha and the Omega instructs St John as he writes the Book of Revelation.ailed explanation of measurements, geometry and astronomical calculations, but I suppose the detail is important in making his points.

This confidence in the power of the placebo effect provides scientific legitimacy to the many claims about mental healing.<br />By exploring recent research in evolutionary biology and immunology, Evans proposes a new theory on how placebos work while investigating and evaluating current ideas of health and disease.  He looks at the history of the placebo effect and investigates the efficacy of placebos by sifting the evidence and providing an opinion on which medical problems can be cured by its use.<br />In chapter 3, The Acute Phase Response, Evans sets out his theory of the function of a single biological mechanism in the placebo phenomenon; he also states that this is not a proven theory and needs much further research. The next chapter looks at the belief effect, the key mental event that triggers physiological processes that result in healing.<br />Investigating the physical and psychological aspects of health in evolutionary context, he also considers the potential of placebos to harm. In more metaphysical terms, one may say he looks at positive and negative mental energy, the curse and the blessing, but in scientific terms. Various alternative healing modalities are also discussed, as well as psychotherapy, which the author claims may be the purest placebo.<br />Ethical questions are considered next in the chapter The Witch Doctor's Dilemma. The author concludes that the impressive findings of recent scientific research in mind-body medicine have revealed that the healing power of the mind may not be unlimited, but that it is certainly not insignificant. The mind fights disease in many ways and one of those is to prompt us to take action, whether by the use of allopathic or alternative medicine. The book concludes with copious notes, a bibliography and an index.

632716:US	50057481	R3D2ZFURE6J6NL	0312319711	507818134	Before the Flood: The Biblical Flood as a Real Event and How It Changed the Course of Civilization	Books	5	39	40	N	N	The real origin of civilization?	This fascinating book investigates a lost culture that thrived in northern Turkey before an inundation in 5600BC turned a freshwater lake into what is now the Black Sea by connecting it to the Mediterranean. Such a cataclysmic event must have caused major destruction and caused the death of thousands of people. It would also not have been restricted to the area under consideration.<br />By looking at the archaeological evidence brought to light by Robert Ballard's submarine explorations and by comparing the flood myths of the world, Wilson connects this disaster with the Biblical account of the Great Flood. He demonstrates that the Biblical account is composed of two different texts that were integrated, texts that he calls J and P. The opening part of original separate strands are displayed side by side. I found this very interesting; each of them is coherent in its own right but has a different emphasis. Both are in fact more coherent on their own than integrated as in the Bible.<br />Wilson suggests that Turkey and the Black Sea area may be the real cradle of civilization. It was the first Post Ice Age civilization and it flourished until about 6000BC. The metropolis of this culture was what is today called Çatal H&uuml;y&uuml;k, a city that was abandoned around this time, most probably because of climate change. It gets really interesting when he looks at the diaspora caused by these natural disasters; Wilson points out shared characteristics of the Minoan culture and the megaliths on the islands of Malta and Gozo. This includes the worship of bulls and the prevalence of the Mother Goddess which is found over an even larger geographic area.<br />There are far flung cultures displaying similarities to traits found at Çatal H&uuml;y&uuml;k, including in Egypt and Sumeria. I found his discussion of loan words in Sumerian very enlightening. Although Wilson is not a linguist, I would have liked a deeper exploration of historical linguistics to cast more light on the matter. He does look at the work of Indo-Europeanists Marija Gimbutas and Colin Renfrew. According to the consensus, the original Indo-European language is considered to have broken up into daughter languages between about 5000 and 4000BC.<br />Another puzzle is why the Indo-European and Semitic parent languages share so many common vocabulary items. Looking at the bigger picture of the Nostratic (or Eurasiatic according to Joseph Greenberg) language family, one finds that there is a great structural similarity between Indo-European, Uralic-Yukagir and even Eskimo, but relatively few shared vocabulary items, the fewer the further North and Northwest you from the Black Sea/Caucasus area. Semitic (a member of the large Afro-Asiatic family) and Indo-European display fundamental structural differences, but share certain phenomena that are clearly linked across their family lines, including key words for concepts like  \\"full, horn, ear, eye, bull, earth.\\"<br />Wilson refers extensively to the work of Dr James Mellaart, the excavator of Çatal H&uuml;y&uuml;k. This theory of an original civilization in the Anatolian/Black Sea area before Egypt and before Sumeria is highly original and very plausible. Wilson is just scratching the surface and further investigation would no doubt lead to more remarkable discoveries. According to the Good Book, there is no end to many books. In this case, the more the merrier.<br />This is a bold direction and needs an interdisciplinary approach. It would be of great value if the author incorporates the work of linguists like Greenberg and Merritt Ruhlen in his further writings. The book concludes with notes &amp; references, a bibliography, an appendix of some key documents and an index. The text is illumed by some really gripping maps and illustrations. I would not classify Before The Flood as \\"alternative history\\" - rather the cutting edge of historical research, already underpinned by significant archaeological discoveries.does look at the work of Indo-Europeanists Marija Gimbutas and Colin Renfrew.

She provides insight into the psychology of the phenomenon, its historical development and the connections between the hatred of Jews and the hatred of America. These connections are confirmed by Andre Markovits in [[ASIN:0691122873 Uncouth Nation]] and Jean-Francois Revel in [[ASIN:159403060X Anti-Americanism]], both of which examine the intellectual climate in Europe.<br /><br />As documented so thoroughly by Bernard Harrison in [[ASIN:0742552268 The Resurgence of Anti-Semitism]] and David Horowitz in [[ASIN:089526076X Unholy Alliance]], Chesler reports that the American and European Liberal-Left and Far Right have embraced the Islamists because of a shared rage projected onto the USA, Israel and the Jewish people. The first group has a pathological need for pack approval, whilst both refuse to do introspection and display an adolescent form of rebelliousness. The flipside consists of slavish adoration of other authorities like demagogues and dictators and a perverse desire for cathartic violence.<br /><br />So what exactly is new about the latest epidemic? For the first time it is being expressed in terms of anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism and anti-racism - issues of the Left. To Leftists, Zionism is colonialism and Israel a Western imposition on the third world. They consider themselves on the side of the underdog; therefore by definition they cannot be racist. The old versions were rooted in theology, ethnicity and nationalism.<br /><br />Chesler provides keen insight on how criticism against Israel and Jews is expressed by the two types of antisemite - the covert and the overt. Important indicators are mood, tone, facial expression and non-verbal behaviors. First, those who indignantly deny that they are antisemites. Is there something sanctimonious, jubilant, sly or insincere in the way they claim to be anti-Zionist but not antisemitic? Do they sound gleeful, energized or triumphant about Israel's troubles?<br /><br />On the other hand, open antisemites are consumed with rage, immoderate and much given to yelling and shaking with anger. A dead give-away is the erotic quality in the hatred. [[ASIN:0452284988 Christopher Hitchens]] and Julie Burchill have noticed this eroticism during the so-called \\"peace\\" marches of 2003 and it is also evident in the behavior of protesting students on American university campuses.<br /><br />Both types subject Israel to intense scrutiny, deny the country the right to defend itself, gleefully pounce on every incident and refuse to admit they were duped when these accusations are later exposed as staged propaganda. They hold Israel to an impossibly high standard of behavior that is demanded of no other country. Obsessed with the Jewish State, they ignore human rights abuses in places like Burma, Chechnya, Tibet and Zimbabwe.<br /><br />Who exactly are they? 1. Western Leftists of the feminist, multiculti, pomo, antiglobalist & environmentalist varieties. Their lairs are primarily in academia, the mass media and non-governmental organizations. This includes the United Nations and its agencies where a species called Transnational Progressives overlaps with 2. Islamists who consider America and Israel as the great and the little Satan. This type encompasses the ruling elites in countries like Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia 3. Old Left ideologues that are still enraged by the collapse of the Marxist dream. 4. Paleoconservative and \\"Libertarian\\" judeopaths who are overjoyed to see their obsession being embraced by those on the opposite side of the political spectrum. Amongst the Paleoconservative Traditionalists there are some prominent Catholics in both the USA and Europe 5. The Religious Left, consisting of theologians in the mainstream churches who are attempting to revive [[ASIN:0805446273 Replacement Theology]], church leaders propagating divestment, the World & Middle East Council of Churches and new movements in America. 6. White supremacist  groups 7. Brainwashed students, bleeding heart naifs and a bewildering array of oddball conspiracy theorists like 9/11 \\"Troofers,\\" some of whom overlap with certain of the aforementioned categories.<br /><br />The war against the Jews is being waged on many fronts: Military, primarily by Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, Hamas and numerous other terror groups; Mass media, through dishonest reporting by influential news organizations; Academia, by the dissemination of propaganda and boycott of Israeli academics; Economic, through the disbursement of Middle Eastern oil money to various groups, think tanks and universities as well as divestment campaigns initiated by certain church denominations; Political, via the United Nations and its agencies as well as direct pressure by oil producers applied to governments around the world; Popular culture, especially in hip hop and white supremacist rock music; the Internet, where thousands of hate groups have found a voice.<br /><br />In [[ASIN:B000H2MURC Never Again?]], Abraham Foxman dates the rebirth of the plague from 1998 and considers 2000 the year in which it exploded. But in his authoritative work [[ASIN:1568215193 Christian Antisemitism]] published in 1993, William Nicholls already saw the signs and identified anti-Zionism as the typical expression of the new antisemitism. Citing a long list of incidents, Chesler reveals that even during the \\"quiet period\\" from 1948 to 1968 the war against the Jews never ceased. Arafat began his terrorist campaign that year, eleven Israeli athletes were murdered at the Munich Olympics in 1972, the UN general assembly equated Zionism with racism in 1975, the plane hijacking to Uganda took place in 1976 and terror attacks were frequent throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

Books	5	4	4	N	N	The healing power of the mind	In this interesting work, the author discusses what the expression It's All In The Mind really means. He investigates the full complexity of the mind's power over the body whilst criticising the mechanistic approach of modern allopathic medicine and demonstrating that our emotions are closely involved in the homeostatic processes that sustain life.<br />Blake also deals with issues like pain thresholds, the intelligence of the immune system, various aspects of infection, what happens at the cellular level in the case of cancer and auto-immune diseases plus many other phenomena that cannot easily be explained by science. He proposes that the body is much more than just a biological machine and that a holistic approach to health is far more sensible. The book concludes with a postscript on AIDS.<br />Blake's main point is that the important factors in healing are those that define us as integrated and whole individuals. Our uniqueness is expressed in the mental and spiritual aspects of our nature. Since spirit and mind permeate our physical lives in all respects, we must cultivate a new awareness of the role of the mind in understanding and healing organic illness.<br />He provides some alternatives in a sympathetic look at homeopathy, hypnosis, imagery, meditation and oriental medicine. There are 5 pages of references, an extensive bibliography and a thorough index. I also recommend the important book Vibrational Medicine by Richard Gerber.	2004-05-23

These powers are not limited to special individuals although it may hold rue that that the lifestyle, dietary and exercise habits, meditations and love of life in certain people are indeed conducive to the development of these powers.<br />Some people are born with a greater inclination or natural talent in a certain direction but all of us can develop most of the vast range of powers and abilities that have always been part of the heritage of the human race. This is particularly true of the powers of the mind, since they have their roots in the instinctive-emotional level of the psyche that is the most ancient and fundamental part of our evolutionary heritage.<br />The book is a practical guide that includes checkpoint exercises at the end of each chapter. The chapters are: 1. Inspiration and Equipment; 2. Exploring Your Potential; 3. Psychic Abilities And Mechanisms; 4. Insight And Foreknowledge; 5. Astral Imprints; 6. The Spiritualist Approach; 7. A Search In Two Worlds. Appendix A deals with ESP testing, record sheets and keeping a log book, whilst Appendix B provides the Tabor Formulation, a meditation for use at the beginning of psychic development sessions. There is also a glossary of terms.<br />Black and white illustrations of pendulums, shapes used for ESP cards, vision mirrors and the method of using angle rods in dowsing, enhance the text. This is a simple, practical and easy-to-use guide. I also recommend Awakening Your Psychic Powers: Open Your Inner Mind And Control Your Psychic Intuition Today by Henry Reed, and for more information on the Ogdoadic tradition of art magic, the book Ogdoadic Magick by Norman R.

That is what Magic(k) really is - applying the powers of the human mind. In all esoteric traditions, this force is harnessed via the meditative state (where the conscious and the subconscious meet) and includes visualization, creating energy and directing that energy towards a goal.<br />Often relating her own experiences, the author explores mediumship, feng shui, crystals, the chakra system, the aura and spiritual healing. Each chapter ends with an exercise that includes affirmations relating to the subject. Crowley has a down-to-earth style and writes from a psychological perspective so her book is mercifully free of clich&eacute;s or psychobabble.<br />She also deals with intuition, dreams, divination, tarot, wands, astrology and planetary magic, incenses and oils and cultivating a prosperity consciousness. As a Wiccan, the author explains the importance of the seasonal changes and the wiccan holy days, an interesting argument but not of particular importance to her overall message of self-development.<br />The book contains plenty of black and white illustrations, tables of correspondences, a bibliography and an index. Although I am not into paganism, I find this book full of common sense and sound psychology, and the author's style to be intelligent and inspiring. A book of wise advice for self-improvement that will help you put some magic into your life.	2004-05-15

A 1977 diary of John Collins that he kept while acting in the film Black President is included. Other contributors include Delede Jegede who writes about cultural aspects of Lagos and Ghariokwu Lemi, the artist who designed Fela's album covers.<br />The book concludes with an index and a Fela Timeline from his birth in 1938 to the latest related events in 2003 after his death in the late 1990s.

Louis Lewin (1850 - 1929) was a world famous pharmacologist and this interesting work remains a landmark of psychedelic research.<br />The preface provides an overview of psychological considerations; the introduction looks at the motives for the use of these substances, the importance of the mental constitution in relation to external stimuli, tolerance and habituation, and immunity against poisons.<br />The author then looks at the mode of action and the classification of narcotic and stimulant drugs. The next section, EUPHORICA, investigates mental sedatives like opium, cocaine and codeine and its derivates. Next is PHANTASTICA (on hallucinogens) which deals with anhalonium lewinii, Indian hemp, fly agaric and the solanaceae.<br />Alcohol, chloroform, ether, benzene and nitrous oxide are discussed under INEBRIANTIA, whilst HYPNOTICA: SOPORIFICS deals with stuff like chloral, veronal, potassium bromide, sulphonal and kava-kava.

He describes certain case studies where the patients suffered from extreme narcissism. I am not convinced that all the cases represent the narcissistic form of evil that Peck tries to define; some may instead be exhibiting psychopathy or types of schizophrenia. In one case, for example, the pathology exhibited itself as victimless if one exempts the patient herself from victim status.<br /><br />Peck sets forth a case for a scientific study of evil and writes engagingly about mental illness and the naming of evil. He also investigates the phenomena of possession and exorcism. It becomes quite interesting when he looks at the fiction of J R R Tolkien and the work of Erich Fromm and Martin Buber and when he discusses the three major theological models of evil, i.e. the nondualism of certain Eastern faiths, the integrated dualism espoused by Buber and the traditional Christian one of diabolic dualism as he terms it.<br /><br />Where the author goes wrong in a big way, is in his study of the My Lai atrocity or rather the conclusions he draws from it: his suggestion for a military draft (involuntary service) and his criticism of specialisation. Here he reveals some utopian notions that I find very questionable. A compulsory draft goes against the principles of individual freedom and besides, utopian schemes invariably turns out evil. The good doctor should know that by now. The coercion involved in society laying that sort of claim on the individual is a totalitarian concept that is by definition evil.<br /><br />Another misconception that I noticed is that Dr Peck still thinks that psychotherapy is a universally good idea, notwithstanding all evidence to the contrary. In addition, he claims that most psychologists are kind, gentle people. That has not been the case in my personal experience or in the literature. It would not surprise me if narcissism were as prevalent amongst psychotherapists as it is in the general population.<br /><br />In this way Dr Peck acts as an apologist for psychotherapy as he also did with his mega selling book The Road Less Travelled. No doubt this therapy has helped some people but it is not the panacea Dr Peck would like to make it. With all of the above provisos, I still recommend this book.  People Of The Lie contains enough that is thought provoking and does provide some original insights while asking some provocative questions.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1432705466 Sinisterism: Secular Religion of the Lie (Revised and Updated Edition)]]the general population.

This scientific investigation is based upon interviews and experiments with people who consider themselves lucky; the author concludes that luck is a state of mind.<br />Wiseman identifies four principles that underlie a life of good fortune, adherence to which will draw good luck into the life of the individual. These are 1. The belief that you are lucky. Lucky people create, notice and act upon chance opportunities. They also have a relaxed attitude to life. 2. Lucky people make success happen by using their intuition and gut feelings. 3. One must expect good fortune, hold fast to this belief and persevere in attempting to achieve your goals. 4. Lucky people have a knack for transforming back luck into good luck. One must affirm your good fortune and have a strong conviction that everything will work out for the best.<br />The text is illustrated by graphs from the research plus some black and white illustrations of playing cards.

710306:US	50057481	R314CUYZ7MEAW4	1930865473	869388620	In Defense of Global Capitalism	Books	5	31	37	N	N	The Good News	In this illuminating and accessible book, Norberg offers a systematic, detailed and complete rebuttal of the claims of the enemies of capitalism and globalization. Backed up by verifiable facts from a huge variety of reputable sources, he demolishes every lie of the leftists and environmentalists. He also investigates the other side of certain half-truths and gives an optimistic assessment of how capitalism, freedom and globalization are improving human lives around the globe.<br /><br />Norberg looks at certain deceptive ideas, for example the one that claims the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer, giving us the good news of rapidly diminishing poverty and pointing out that the measure should be how well one is doing, not how well situated one is in relation to others. He explores the facts concerning issues like hunger, education, freedom and equality. Improvements have been particularly spectacular in China and India since these countries started reforming their economic systems.<br /><br />He shows how the walls against ideas, people and goods are collapsing with dictatorships and how women benefit from the spread of capitalism. The best cure for poverty is growth; prices and profits serve as a signalling system in the market economy whereby the worker, the entrepreneur and the investor all benefit. The importance of property rights are pointed out, with reference to the work of De Soto, and the author compares the success of the Asian Tigers with the sorry state of Africa, although even here the open societies like South Africa, Mauritius and Botswana are doing well.<br /><br />Norberg dismisses the hoary old argument that western countries are rich because they stole the resources of Third World countries in colonial times. The affluent world has grown faster since shedding its colonies, many rich countries (like Sweden and Switzerland) never had any colonies, whilst some of the world's least developed countries (Nepal, Liberia) have never been colonies. Nor have countries with natural resources as a rule grown as fast as those without, for example Singapore. A brilliant example of free trade success is Estonia, which soon after independence in 1992 abolished all tariffs.<br /><br />The 20 economically most liberal countries have a per capita GDP of approximately 29 times that of the economically least liberal. The uneven distribution of wealth in the world is due to the uneven distribution of capitalism and the losers of the world are those that have been left out of globalisation.<br /><br />Norberg attacks agricultural subsidies in the affluent countries, showing that this ridiculous practice harms those countries themselves and the developing world. He demonstrates the absurdity of Europe's Common Agricultural Policy, a bureaucratic nightmare that channels nearly 40% of the entire EU budget to less than 1% of the population. Latin America still suffers from decades of privilege and protectionism, but Chile is a good example of how quickly a country can transform itself with the right policies, to create a high standard of living.<br /><br />Norberg investigates a vast range of issues, from development assistance (It is wasteful in that it normally involves the transfer of money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries), child labour and working conditions. He argues convincingly that free trade and capitalism alleviate social problems. He also proves that prosperity is beneficial for the environment, refuting the spurious claims of environmentalists and quoting from Bjorn Lomborg's remarkable book, [[ASIN:0521010683 The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World]].<br /><br />Norberg considers every angle, including issues like \\"cultural imperialism\\" and the risible notion of the \\"dictatorship of the market\\", showing how capitalism and democracy go hand in hand in creating a better world. The book includes an index and 14 pages of notes. The text is enhancedby graphs demonstrating the facts and arguments. He concludes the book on an optimistic note, i.e.  that people are beginning to wake up to the fact that they aren't just the tools of society but ends in themselves and that freedom and democracy will spread and continue to improve the lives of everyone on the planet.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0871139499 On The Wealth of Nations (Books That Changed the World)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0451147952 Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]ludes the book on an optimistic note, i.e.  that people are beginning to wake up to the fact that they aren't just the tools of society but ends in themselves and that freedom and democracy will spread and continue to improve the lives of everyone on the planet.

He points out the similarities between the law of gravitation and the mental law of attraction. He explains that thought vibrations are as real as those manifesting as light, heat, magnetism and electricity. The difference is in the vibratory rate which also explains the fact that thought vibrations cannot usually be perceived by our 5 senses.<br />He argues that there are huge gaps in the spectrum of light and sound vibrations, wide enough to include other worlds. It is logical that these activities would be perceived by sense organs attuned to them. Increasingly sophisticated scientific instruments are able to register more and more of these hidden frequencies.<br />There is constant interaction between negative and positive thought vibrations - it is the task of the individual to raise the keynote of their mind to a positive pitch by an act of will. Atkinson discusses the purpose of affirmations as twofold: firstly, to establish new mental attitudes, secondly to raise the mental keynote. He also mentions that there must be a balance between giving out expressions and taking in impressions in a receptive state.<br />The many faculties of the mind are identified and discussed, and the author asserts that the current of will-power flows strongly along spiritual wires but the individual must train in order to optimally tap into this energy source. The \\"I\\" is the master of the mind and the \\"will\\" is the instrument of the \\"I.\\" Affirmations for internalising this insight are provided here.<br />Atkinson also shows how to overcome negative emotions like fear, worry, envy, anger and hate. He firmly believes in the operation of universal law in all circumstances and advises the reader to tune in to the harmony of the law. I found the chapters Asserting The Life Force and Training The Habit Mind particularly helpful and inspiring.<br />Although this book was written years ago, the text still sounds fresh and contemporary. The explanations of mental laws and processes are clear and concise and the exercises are simple and effective. I enjoyed the author's infectious optimism and his simple, direct approach.e text still sounds fresh and contemporary.

Humphries writes engagingly about Drake's early years, with reference to the culture of the fifties and speculations on possible early musical influences. The description of the British pop scene in the early 1960s and how it related to Drake's years at Marlborough school is very helpful in framing Drake's music in time and place.<br />It's interesting that the singer had completed his schooldays in 1966 when The Beatles released Revolver and Dylan was making waves with Blonde On Blonde. Nick's visits to France and Marrakech are covered in detail. The description of the UK folk scene of those times is very informative, as Humphries writes about musicians like Danny Thompson, Fairport Convention and Richard &amp; Linda Thompson and the clubs and circuits where they performed.<br />Much of the text consists of various peoples' recollections of Drake, most of them within the music industry. So there is an amount of repetition and revisiting the same eras and incidents through the eyes of different narrators. Humphries also discusses Drake's rare coverage by various music publications of the time like Sounds and Melody Maker, including reviews of his albums. In addition, he attempts to recreate the circumstances of the recording of each album and provides illuminating information and opinions on most of the individual songs. I was particularly pleased to read about John Cale's contribution to Bryter Layter and his recollections of the recording sessions.<br />Drake's tragic decline from a happy, well-adjusted school kid to increasingly isolated and alienated young man is treated with understatement, but the overall effect leaves a strong impression. The chapters on Drake's posthumous rediscovery and growing influence are well-researched and provides detailed information on covers of his songs and compilation albums that contain his work. There are eight pages of black &amp; white plates with photographs, a lino cut and a pencil sketch. The book concludes with a discography that includes Drake's individual and compilation albums, multi-artist compilations and the tribute album Brittle Days.are eight pages of black &amp; white plates with photographs, a lino cut and a pencil sketch.

Written in white heat after the events of 9/11, the article grew longer and longer; she had to trim it, and afterwards expanded the piece again in order to say everything she wanted to get off her chest. In her own words, she was trying to open the eyes of those who do not want to see, unplug the ears of those who do not want to hear and ignite the thoughts of those who refuse to think.<br /><br />In her introductory dedication, Fallaci explains that the English text is her own translation and there may be oddities in the style and vocabulary, but that she wanted it to be like that because she wishes to retain complete responsibility or every word and comma that she has to say in this book. I found her language quite charming, an Italianate version of English brimming with rage and fury.<br /><br />In the Preface, she talks about inter alia New York as a place of refuge for Italian expatriates, her family background, the process of writing the newspaper article that eventually evolved into this book and much more besides.<br /><br />The main text starts out with her feelings right after she saw the attack on the Twin Towers on TV and what followed. She also discusses the various reactions from around the globe, the heroism of the fire-fighters and America's unity in the face of adversity.<br /><br />Fallaci really lays into the politically correct, the supporters of multiculturalism and the apologists for terrorism. While not blind to the faults of the West, she vigorously defends western culture, even Christianity, although she claims to be an atheist.<br /><br />She talk extensively about her travels in the Middle East and relates a humorous incident about the time she interviewed the ayatollah Khomeini in Iran, and a sad encounter with Ali Bhutto, a former Pakistani prime minister. Her outrage at the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas is palpable and she gives a moving account of her meeting with the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala in 1968.<br /><br />Fallaci doesn't mince words as she talks about the growing numbers of culturally non-integrated minorities in her native Italy and the problems arising from that situation. It would appear that she despairs for the future of Europe, lashing out at certain European leaders. She calls the EU a frustrating, disappointing and insignificant financial club - the suicide of Europe.<br /><br />I think The Rage And The Pride must be the most politically incorrect book that I have ever read. It is brutally honest, emotional and perhaps a bit over the top in one or two places where it might make some readers' hair stand on end. But it is a great read, one very special woman's testament to the dangers facing the West, and why our culture is worth preserving.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0743289684 Infidel]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:083864077X Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000W8WSGY Now They Call Me Infidel: Why I Renounced Jihad for America, Israel, and the War on Terror]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0312358377 Because They Hate: A Survivor of Islamic Terror Warns America]]meeting with the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala in 1968.

One of the most naïve delusions held by the American Left is that the current administration's foreign policy has made the USA an object of hatred. As a South African, I have news for them: The hatred directed against your president now is really hatred of your country. I first became aware of this loathing of America amongst Marxists and Fascists in the 1980s. By the nineties it had spread into the mainstream media and was much in evidence at the time of Clinton's intervention in Yugoslavia at the end of that decade. Yet these hysterical critics could provide no alternative way to stop Milosevich's ethnic cleansing. They have always hated America for what it is, rather than for what it does.<br /><br />In the chapter Contradictions Revel examines the inherently contradictory character of the diatribes against America, pointing out how European elites that criticise the USA conveniently forget that their own continent made the 20th century the most murderous in history with their two world wars, their criminal ideologies like communism and nazism and their colonialism. He also discusses the enviro-leftist hypocrisy about global warming and the Kyoto protocol. In this regard, please read Bjorn Lomborg's book The Skeptical Environmentalist.<br /><br />Revel then turns his attention to Antiglobalism and Anti-Americanism, proving that it really is a struggle against liberalism, of which the USA is a shining example. It is not that the left has anything against globalism, they just don't like the fact that people worldwide will be able freely trade with one another without government interference. These mostly young antiglobalists are blind ideologues, remnants from a past of cruelty and bloodshed. Poor Third World countries want more international trade because that is the only way they'll escape from poverty, in the same way Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and others have done, and India is now doing. Only economic growth lifts poverty, as Johan Norberg demonstrates so well in his book In Defense Of Global Capitalism.<br /><br />Revel discusses R&eacute;gis Benichi's three waves of globalization: the first started during the 16th and 17th centuries, the second that lasted from 1840 to 1914, and the third which has continued since the end of the second world war and has improved the lives of third world people in direct proportion to the individual countries' adherence to the rule of law and to the level of economic freedom.<br /><br />He explores America's relations with the world in the chapter Hatreds And Fallacies, detailing the distortions from the left following 9/11 and the liberation of Afghanistan. The phobias and fallacies of old-style anti-Americanism and of Neo-totalitarianism greatly intensified at this time. Revel also looks at the strange alliance between the Leftists and the Islamofascists, a marriage of convenience based on hatred.<br /><br />In the next chapter The Worst Society That Ever Was, Revel tackles the crude lies about American society invented by the French media. He points out the deliberate distortions and the contradictions, observing that such mendacity can only emanate from sick minds. He compares health care in the USA and Europe, looks at literature, crime statistics, the American melting pot versus large non-integrated minorities in France. I really enjoyed his dissection of the French state-sponsored movie industry and his hilarious opinion of the film Amelie as compared to the films of for example Ken Loach.<br /><br />In the chapter Cultural Extinction, Revel considers popular culture in more detail, proving that cross-fertilisation benefits everybody and that state protection of local culture leads to stagnation. Globalization enhances cultural diversity and is an engine of enrichment. He warns that anti-American phobias and antiglobalism might derail progress in Europe, referring to Guy Sorman's book Progress And Its Enemies. This is neither a right-wing nor left-wing idea, but a rational argument also defended by the socialist Claude Allegr&eacute;.<br /><br />In chapter 6: Being Simplistic, Revel demolishes the argument that poverty is the root cause of terrorism, quoting Francis Fukuyama that the secular character of the Western concept of human rights at the heart of the liberal theory is the real enemy for the Jihadists. The Al-Qa'ida terrorists don't even mention economic inequalities, but reproach the West for contravening the teachings (or fundamentalist interpretations) of their religion's scripture.<br /><br />In the last chapter: Scapegoating, Revel distinguishes between rational criticism of the USA that is based on facts, and the mental/spiritual disease that is Anti-Americanism. The second is a fanatical mindset that is also obviously idiotic in that it condemns America for a certain behaviour (intervention in Kosovo) while simultaneously condemning it for the opposite (lack of intervention in Rwanda). Where was France anyway, in the case of Rwanda, since it has always interfered in Francophone Africa when it suits French interests. He cites numerous instances where the French elite demonises America while much worse was happening in France, like the fact that the extreme rightist Le Pen came second in the first round of the French presidential election of 2000.<br /><br />Revel concludes that the lunatic ravings of hatred for America and the opinionated ill will in much of the European media will only lead to Americans rejecting the idea of consultation. He believes that the USA's mistakes should always be subject to vigilant criticism but that the gross bias currently reigning will only weaken its exponents and encourage American unilateralism.<br /><br />The most important lesson from this book is that anti-Americanism is a disease, not a position. The prognosis is not good - Revel believes that countering this attitude with facts and reason will not work: \\" ... the disinformation in question is not the result of pardonable, correctable mistakes, but rather of profound psychological need.\\"<br /><br />For more information on the mental disease of the hard left, (specifically in America), please read [[ASIN:1400052947 The Death of Right and Wrong]] by Tammy Bruce, [[ASIN:046508995X The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation As a Basis for Social Policy]] by Thomas Sowell and [[ASIN:1890626562 Left Illusions: An Intellectual Odyssey]] by David Horowitz.

It presents a programme of exercise, stress reduction, diet and supplementation, including the use of natural hormones. The information is well researched and the scope of the work is extensive.<br />The book provides cutting-edge information on the very latest supplements that assist in maintaining health. One of these is carnosine, an important anti-oxidant with anti-glycation properties. The amino acid N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) is recommended for its multiple benefits, whilst some of the other youth-preserving substances are CoQ10, fish oil, lipoic acid and friendly intestinal bacteria like acidophilus.<br />To keep the brain young and healthy, the best supplements to take include Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Phosphatydilserine, Vinpocetine, DMAE and Gingko Biloba. Their effects and benefits are thoroughly explained. Smart drugs like Hydergine and Deprenyl (Eldepryl) that show great promise, are also discussed in this chapter.<br />The authors present a comprehensive investigation of hrmones and hormone replacement, making a good case for the transdermal delivery of testosterone and natural progesterone through the use of patches or creams. Considering growth hormone deficit as a major factor in aging, the authors call it \\"tissue repair hormone\\" and recommend supplementation.<br />I highly recommend this book to all people over 30 who wish to stop the clock of biological aging and remain healthy.

This is the amino acid 5-hydroxitryptophan which increases the availability of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Whereas the drugs work by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, 5-HTP raises serotonin levels in a natural way and therefore has fewer and less severe side effects.<br />The authors cite various clinical studies to show that 5-HTP may be helpful in relieving depression, alleviating anxiety, panic and obsessive-compulsive disorder, reducing the pain of migraine and fibromyalgia, improving sleep and suppressing appetite. There is also preliminary evidence that 5-HTP may be useful for treating the discomfort of PMS and for reducing aggression. The authors also discuss the safety concerns of taking this amino acid, its drug interactions and provide dosing guidelines.<br />There is growing evidence of the efficacy of a variety of natural substances in the above conditions; these include the amino acids L-Tyrosine, DL-Phenylalanine and Tryptophan. One drawback of the book is that the authors only discuss Tryptophan in some detail and make cursory references to the herb St. John's Wort, while other natural substances like Trimethylglycine, Essential Fatty Acids and Acetyl-L-Carnitine are also showing great promise.<br />The booklet nevertheless contains valuable information and serves to introduce this natural anti-depressant to a wider audience. For a more comprehensive look at all of the aforementioned and other nutrients, I recommend Ray Sahelian's book Mind Boosters: A Guide To Natural Supplements That Enhance Your Mind, Memory And Mood.	2004-01-10

The actual art is presented in an enlarged form on full or double pages. There is biographical information on each of the eight artists as well as some of their own quotes and thoughts.

The main difference between the two is that Christianity focuses on faith whilst Gnosticism seeks a state of consciousness in which the divine can be directly experienced. Hoeller's excellent book investigates the history of the Gnostic worldview as an indigenous Western mystical tradition. It is also a concise and sympathetic look at the teachings and spiritual lineage of Gnosticism.<br />According to the author, Gnosticism straddles the divide between psychology and religion - the place where soul and spirit meet, where dream and vision are transformed into an experience of liberation. Gnostic myths, metaphors and symbols partake of both psychological and metaphysical meaning. It this sense they are like endless loops in which psychological meaning points to metaphysical meaning that leads one back to the individual psyche again. It is the place where cosmology and psychology fuse, where archetypes and deities merge and separate in an endless dance. In both the intrapsychic and external sense, Gnostic myths belong in depth psychology and religion at the same time.<br />The author discusses the Gnostic view of the soul and of the divine and manifest worlds, considers the Gnostic Christ as a guide to the sacred mysteries and as Liberator more than Saviour and looks at the concept of Sophia (wisdom) in the Gnostic tradition. Various groups like the Mandaeans, Manicheans and Cathars are investigated.<br />One of the most interesting sections deals with three great Gnostic thinkers: Valentinus (famous for the poetic beauty of his words), Basilides (renowned for his mystical profundity) and Marcion (noted for his informed criticism of the Bible.) Finally Hoeller considers the influence of Gnostic ideas on writers and artists like Blake, Jung, Hesse, Melville and others.<br />Another very gripping section looks at Gnosticism in the light of Chaos Theory, Modernism, Post-Modernism and Nihilism. Here, Hoeller very convincingly refutes the claims of certain critics that Gnosticism is similar to nihilism and proves that it is, on the contrary, a very positive and life-affirming worldview that offers hope to the individual in the 21st century.<br />The text is enhanced by black and white illustrations of ancient and modern Gnostic art, and the book includes a glossary of terms, a general reading list, a bibliography of modern books and an index. I also recommend this same author's earlier masterpiece, The Gnostic Jung And The Seven Sermons To The Dead.ost-Modernism and Nihilism.

It is an honest account of the people and events that shaped her beliefs and convictions. At the same time it reveals some horrific aspects of popular culture, politics and the media as they operate today.<br /><br />Bruce exposes the rank hypocrisy, soul-destroying motives and malevolent mind-set of the Left in chapters dealing with the Academic, Black, Gay and Feminist Elites, plus some destructive tendencies in the arts, the media and the justice system in the United States today. Some of her examples make harrowing reading, whilst her insight is often tinged by a bit of humour, for example when she identifies the gangster rapper as the current equivalent of Rousseau's \\"noble savage\\" in the eyes of the Left.<br /><br />Bruce's diagnosis rings true. She discusses the mental disease called malignant narcissism and explains how it is rooted in trauma that never attempts recovery. These individuals, instead of seeking psychological help, are focusing on social change. In other words, they want the rest of society to mirror their own hurt and pain.<br /><br />She makes a very convincing case for the fact that an entire wing of politics is invested in the victim-hood of its constituency, the leaders of which are trying to work out their demons on society. This is scary stuff, but easy to recognize from the examples in the book or by taking a critical and discerning approach towards trends in the media.<br /><br />To be fair, Bruce points out that there are similar people on the Right (puritanical compulsives), but that these do not control the culture. The concept and repulsive results of moral relativism and the phenomenon of groupthink are also analysed. The author quotes Dr M Scott Peck and recommends his book [[ASIN:0684848597 People of the Lie]] for a thorough investigation of malignant narcissism and its use of the lie to distort reality.<br /><br />A chilling read at times, The Death Of Right And Wrong is a brilliant and eloquent exposure of some pathological strains infecting large sectors of culture and society. The book ends on an optimistic note with a call to the individual to recognize the difference between right and wrong, to take a stand and to live a life of decency and integrity.<br /><br />The book concludes with 31 pages of notes and references arranged by chapter, plus a thorough index. It is a real eye-opener, a thought-provoking work that offers unique political and psychological insights. I also recommend Paul Johnson's groundbreaking work [[ASIN:0061253170 Intellectuals: From Marx and Tolstoy to Sartre and Chomsky]] for an interesting look at the private lives of certain famous writers and philosophers, and Thomas Sowell's book [[ASIN:046508995X The Vision of the Anointed]].<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385511841 Liberal Fascism: The Secret History of the American Left, From Mussolini to the Politics of Meaning]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1432705466 Sinisterism: Secular Religion of the Lie (Revised and Updated Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0895260263 Unholy Alliance: Radical Islam and the American Left]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0742552276 The Resurgence of Anti-Semitism: Jews, Israel, and Liberal Opinion (Philosophy and the Global Context)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0007229690 What's Left?]]chilling read at times, The Death Of Right And Wrong is a brilliant and eloquent exposure of some pathological strains infecting large sectors of culture and society.

The ways she provides to achieve altered states of consciousness are safe, effective and wholesome.<br />The Way Of Mystery concludes with a short but inspiring book of mystical revelations.

The author explains how to find missing or lost items, how to attune to people through photographs and how to read imprints on objects and places.<br />One of the most useful sections of the book explains how one may easily detect and correct energy imbalances in the body and mind. There are many exercises and some illustrations throughout the book and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.<br />However, one cannot expect to successfully develop this ability by merely reading the book - a lot of work and patience are required.

I would also like to recommend the book How To Meet And Work With Spirit Guides by Ted Andrews, a classic of the genre.<br />In addition, the use of recorded guided meditations is a sure way of facilitating contact and in this regard I recommend the CDs and tapes of Dr. Eldon Taylor as they are technologically advanced and very effective.	2003-12-18

This book is a field guide for the prospective paranormal investigator.

The advice is very practical and the author obviously has years of experience in this field. He provides details on the types of entities likely to be encountered, like ghosts, spirits or dangerous spirit creatures that are best left to an experienced exorcist. I found the sections on how to capture paranormal phenomena on film and how to record disembodied voices and sounds on tape particularly interesting, as these are easy to do with equipment that most people already have. What's more, it can be done anywhere as all walls and buildings contain some residue of recorded voices. Plenty of sources for material are provided, as well as contact details of organisations devoted to studying these phenomena.

This simple, down-to-earth book explains what it is, its history, how it works and it offers the reader an introduction to the basic ritual work.<br />It investigates the sources of the Western tradition and the roots of Hermeticism. The authors' account of the history of the Order of the Golden Dawn and its colourful founders is very thorough and makes for engaging reading.<br />The book clearly illustrates the principles and philosophies of high magick and explains its laws in a straightforward manner. In addition, it covers all of the various areas of magkical knowledge and provides plenty of Golden Dawn rituals for the newcomer.<br />I also recommend Israel Regardie's Garden Of Pomegranates: Skrying On The Tree Of Life, edited and annotated by Chic Cicero and Sandra Tabatha Cicero. This is a classic work on the Qabalah for the more advanced student.<br />As an alternative to the Golden Dawn tradition, I recommend the book Foundations Of High Magick by Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips.

Many remedies for acute and chronic conditions are provided. This excellent book bridges the gap between ancient wisdom and modern medicine, rescuing time-tested treatments from obscurity and applying them to our times.<br />These ancient techniques are mostly based on the principle of vibrational medicine, just like homeopathy and Dr. Bach's flower remedies. I therefore also recommend Gerber's excellent book Vibrational Medicine for a more thorough scientific analysis of how and why this system works.

At the same time it deals with spirit guides, animals on the astral plane and how to experience great freedom and adventure with the out-of-body phenomenon.<br />I also recommend the author and Melita Denning's book Psychic Self-Defence And Well-Being, and the book by Norman R.

She discusses these wounds in great detail and elaborates upon the various masks that we develop in order to hide them. In this way she makes it easy to identify the real causes of specific problems. Her ideas are fascinating, especially where she deals with body weight and other clues provided by our bodies. Apparently even the way we dance provides insight into our particular wounds and the masks we use to cover them. Her healing insights are very valuable and following them will set the individual on the path to complete healing and to realising their full potential. Her approach is unique and innovative and her methods of healing appeal to common sense. This is a great book to learn more about oneself and become a healthier and happier person.	2003-12-14

Unfortunately the over-prescription and unwise use of these medicines have created resistant organisms and in this age of the superbug it is wise to become familiar with the natural alternatives that fight infection and that usually have fewer and less serious side effects.<br />In this updated and revised of his work, the author considers a variety of strains of infection that have developed resistance since the first edition of this book. The sections on homeopathic, nutritional and herbal remedies and cures for infection have been enlarged and brought up to date.<br />From this book, it is clear that it is still possible and even preferable to fight infection without the use of antibiotics. At the same time, McKenna acknowledges the value of antibiotics in many instances. This is a valuable guide to alternative ways of staying healthy, and provides a balanced look at health and the antibiotic question.<br />The book includes a bibliography and thorough index. Another great book that deals with this topic is Leon Chaitow's Antibiotic Crisis, Antibiotic Alternatives.	2003-12-10

The practical application of the remedies is thoroughly explained and there is an interesting discussion of the 38 flowers from which they are made and their qualities.<br />A helpful Question and Answer section addresses frequently asked questions. The book concludes with a bibliography, list of useful addresses and an index. In additional to this informative book and for a wider look at holistic medicine, I highly recommend Gerber's masterpiece Vibrational Medicine.	2003-12-09

This new interpretation of history may be compared with the work of Velikovsky although their conclusions are not the same; Velikovsky identifies Ramses I with Necho I of the end of the 7th century B.C.<br />I don't know who is correct, but Osman certainly provides a great read in this book as he identifies the biblical Joseph with Yuya, grand vizier of the 18th dynasty pharaoh Tuthmose IV. From this follows the introduction of monotheism by queen Tiye and her son Akhenaten. This explains the animosity shown towards Akhenaten and his religion by the later pharaoh Horemheb, whom Osman identifies as the oppressor king of the book of Exodus.<br />This book consists of two parts: A Father To Pharaoh which details the aforementioned history, and Notes And Sources, which contains the evidence and an interesting chapter on the name of Joseph/Yuya. This fascinating work concludes with a bibliography and index.<br />I also recommend The House Of The Messiah by this author plus the books of Immanuel Velikovsky, like Ages In Chaos, Oedipus And Akhnaten an Ramses II And His Time.	2003-12-09

Ancient Egypt and Mohenjo Daro are also investigated, as is the sudden appearance of domesticated plants and animals.<br />The sections on metallurgy, ice ages, cataclysms and the mysterious Civilization X are never less than gripping, as is his discussion of chronological cycles, the Maya calendar and our possible cosmic ancestry.<br />Hart reaches the same conclusion as Von Daniken and Sitchin: humanity is the result of a genetic cloning experiment by an advanced race that lived among their creatures in ancient times. The Genesis Race provides fascinating reading and those who enjoy this book will also benefit from reading the works of Zecharia Sitchin.	2003-12-09

An early holistic practitioner, she used stones, crystals, herbs, words and music in her healing art. Strehlow's book is based upon Hildegard's Book Of Values In Life, in which she discusses 35 risk factors that are harmful to humanity plus the 35 healing forces that counteract these negatives.<br />The book makes the connection between physical illness and the sickness of the soul and recommends Hildegard's spiritual remedies instead of surgery, chemical treatment and radiation. The mind controls the body, in particular the autonomic nervous system and all major systems like digestion, sexuality and the immune system.  This ties in with modern theories on spiritual healing, like psycho-neuro-immunology. Hildegard's wisdom connects the 35 vertebrae of the spinal cord to the aforementioned 35 spiritual forces of the human body, making clear the connection to every organ.<br />These 35 factors are discussed in chapters 3 - 7: The Eastman, The Westman, the Northman, The Southman and The New Elders' Ascent To The Summit under sections titled Crystal Therapy, Harmful Words, Healing Words, Organ Relationship and Spiritual Healing. Chapter 6: Fasting, deals with fasting as a way to discover one's true personality. Throughout, the importance of the unity of the body, mind, and soul is stressed. Good health is the result of the right ordering of the relationship of the emotional, physical, mental and spiritual dimensions into a harmonious whole.<br /><br />For a general introduction and overview of Hildegard's various writings, I recommend the book Selected Writings: Hildegard of Bingen (Penguin Classics) by Mark Atherton. I would also like to recommend the CD Monk And The Abbess. This remarkable album contains four of her compositions: O Quam Mirabilis (Antiphon for the Creator), O Ecclesia (Sequence for St. Ursula), O Clarissima Mater (Responsory for the Virgin) and Tu Illustrata (Antiphon for the Virgin), exquisitely performed by the great musician Meredith Monk. Monk and the Abbess is a highly inspiring album and should appeal to those who appreciate vocal medieval and classical music.<br />In The Spiritual Remedies, Strehlow succeeds in making accessible the wisdom and insight of this medieval visionary in a practical and useful manner, highly relevant to our time. The text is enhanced with plenty of black and white illustrations. The book contains biographical notes on the author and on Hildegard and concludes with an extensive bibliography and a thorough index.r the Virgin) and Tu Illustrata (Antiphon for the Virgin), exquisitely performed by the great musician Meredith Monk.

This humorous and entertaining book deals with the use of psychedelic substances by our 4-footed and 6-legged friends. The author, an ethnobotanist, provides amazing examples of animals and insects seeking out and consuming psycho-active substances in their environments.<br />Samorini suggests that the desire to experience altered states of consciousness is a natural drive shared by all living beings. This urge is not confined to humans because animals/insects deliberately engage in these behaviors. His theory is that beings that consume these substances contribute to the evolution of their species by creating new patterns of behavior that are eventually adopted by the other members of the species, in what he humorously terms \\"evolution by inebriation.\\"<br />He deals with crazed cows who love locoweed (Astralagus), elephants, slugs and snails, felines and catnip, reindeer and caribou tripping on the Amanita mushroom, goats that have a liking for coffee and khat (Catha Edulis), birds that binge (robins and the pink pigeon of the Mauritian islands), koalas, baboons and rats, plus insects like the house fly (Amanita again), moths, bees and butterflies.<br />Samorini concludes with the observation that a distinction must be made between a drug phenomenon that is natural and a drug problem that is a cultural problem. This insightful book concludes with a bibliography and index.<br />Other interesting titles on this topic includes DMT: The Spirit Molecule by Rick Strassman, Moksha by Aldous Huxley, Magic Mushrooms In Religion And Alchemy by Clark Heinrich and Persephone's Quest by R.

It does more than merely reveal the detailed techniques from a master of hyper-realism, Michael English, who has combined airbrushed hyper realism and other elements to produce a wonderful art book in a unique style.<br />English boldly exposes his failures and mistakes while proudly exhibiting his remarkable successes.  In his distinctive style he explains the tools, equipment and materials of his discipline in a way that you will never find in technical guides. His comments on his own pictures are refreshingly honest and his views on the decade of the 1960s are never less than original and engaging.<br />The chapter headings are: Beginnings, Equipments and Applications, Techniques and Effects, Methods, Construction and Canvases, and the book concludes with Chapter Five: Conclusion, Afterword (with a photograph of the author) and Acknowledgements.<br />My favourite plates include Toyah 1979 (a poster for the singer and actress), Ball Strikes Water 1971, Oil On Water 1974, Grace Tomato Juice 1973 and Vallee de Mal, Seychelles 1988.<br />The Anatomy Of Illusion is a wonderful work for the graphic designer, the art student and the art lover who is interested in social history.

He claims that in the first place, it serves to answer the type of awkward questions that children ask, like Who made the world or Who were the first people? The second function of myth is to justify an existing social system and to account for traditional customs and rites.<br />Graves points out how myths of origin and eventual extinction vary according to the climate and that one finds a warm celestial afterworld in the north or a fresh flowered Elysian Field in Greece. He also deals with the Akan of Ghana and with Egypt and India. His conclusion is that myth is a dramatic shorthand record of stuff like invasions, migrations, dynastic changes, admission of foreign cults and social reforms. For example, when bread was first introduced in Greece, the myth of Demeter and Triptolemus sanctified its use.<br />The Encyclopedia investigates prehistoric mythology and that of Egypt, Assyro-Babylonia, Phoenicia, Greece, Rome, Persia, India, China, Japan, Oceania and that of the Celts, the Teutons, the Amerindians and Africans. It contains 34 colour plates and hundred of black and white illustrations and it concludes with a further reading list divided under different headings reflecting its chapter contents, plus a thorough index.	2003-11-18

It discusses terms like abstract\\" and \\"avant-garde\\" and explores the historical background to modern art, starting with the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. It also treats the role of Royal Academy and the French Salon and looks at the impact of photography and the role of the arts and crafts movement. The main text then proceeds with the chapters Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Symbolism, The Nabis, The Vienna Secession and Art Nouveau.<br />The second part is titled The Twentieth Century and it consists of chapters on inter alia Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, Futurism, Vorticism, Modern Sculpture, De Stijl, Dada and Surrealism, The Bauhaus, Mexican Revolutionary Art, Postwar Europe, The 1960s, Pop, Art in Australia and Art in America, Motion and Mechanics, Happenings and Assemblage, Minimalism, Conceptual Art, Realism and Superrealism.<br />The book offers a cornucopia of full color pictures, of which many are full-page plates. There are also black and white illustrations. Paging through this book overwhelms the senses, but a quick perusal confirms my love for the work of Salvador Dali (whose Premonition Of Civil War 1936 and Christ Of St. John Of the Cross 1951) are reproduced here, plus Andy Warhol who's Marilyn 1967 is here. David Hockney's Peter Getting Out Of Nick's Pool 1966 is also very striking.<br />This masterpiece of a book concludes with an in-depth bibliography, a section on picture information and a thorough index. As it was published in 1985 it cannot be considered the last word on modern art anymore, but it remains an impressive reference work that comprehensively and engagingly maps the art of the twentieth century up to middle 1980s.	2003-11-18

During the final decade of the 19th century Western society was being transformed radically. The automobile, photography and the rise of psychoanalysis were just three elements that contributed to this change.<br />Costantino's book examines the sources of Art Nouveau in the English Arts &amp; Crafts Movement, in Expressionist painting and in Symbolist poetry. These forms were themselves a reaction to rapid industrial development. Art Nouveau is seen by many as the expression of the last vestiges of a unity in European culture and the continuous interchange of ideas within it. It is a flowing style characterised by a love of detail, pattern and texture.<br />This work profiles the remarkable figures that gave style and shape to the movement, including Ren&eacute; Lalique, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Antonio Gaud&iacute; and Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

It marked the rise of unorthodox forms of expression and a huge increase in the written word about art. The book deals almost exclusively with British and American developments since the art of the sixties was overwhelmingly shaped by London and New York.<br />Adams' illuminating text explores the decade's art from many angles and with reference to commentators like Tom Wolfe, Alvin Toffler, Daniel Buren, Harold Rosenberg, Dwight Macdonald, Peter Fuller, Frank Popper and others. Forms and labels like Neo Dada, Op, Pop, Kinetic, Minimalist and Kinetic are investigated with a critical eye.<br />The 60s was certainly an exciting decade that produced enduring art by among others Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Hamilton, Claes Oldenburg and Peter Blake. The best of their work is represented here in a wealth of full colour and black and white reproductions.<br />My favourite images include Screamin J Hawkins by Karl Wirsum, Marilyn Monroe 1967 by Warhol, Perfect Match by Allen Jones, after The Monarch Of The Glen by Peter Blake, Takka Takka by Roy Lichtenstein, Bus Window by Richard Estes, The Miller Blues Band by Victor Moscoso and Hippopotamus by Mel Ramos.<br />Art Of The Sixties is an illuminating read that captures the flavour of the decade very well. I am sure there are more exhaustive books on the subject but this one does a good job of dealing with the essentials. The informative text is enhanced by 66 illustrations of which 26 are in colour.	2003-11-12

The Art Deco style took its name from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels that was held in Paris in 1925. As the 20th century developed, the flowing lines of Art Nouveau gave way to the new rhythms of Art Deco, a style that confidently celebrated the machine age with prominent geometric forms, lively colour schemes and the use of materials like plastic. It was an enthusiastic embrace of the future.<br />Lavishly illustrated with more than 300 colour and black and white photographs, Weber's work offers a splendid record of the most prominent style of the years between the wars. Art, architecture, photography, furniture, jewellery, interior design, film sets, posters, glass and ceramics are all encompassed here since many of the style's greatest artists worked in several media to create beautiful buildings with attractive art deco interiors.<br />Weber's brilliant book also examines the influence of the Bauhaus, Neo-classicism, Cubism, Futurism and other movements on the style, and the influence of art deco on the international style that supplanted it after the second world war. The work of architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Ely Jacques Kahn, William Van Alen and Giles Gilbert Scott, ceramicist Clarice Cliff and sculptor Paul Manship among others, are discussed in detail. One of my personal favourite pieces is a 1927 poster by Paul Colin for Josephine Baker and her jazz ensemble.<br />The chapters are titled Art Deco Style On Show, Exuberant Architecture, Furniture And Interior Design, Sculpture, Painting and Photography, Graphic Art and Illustration, Glass, Ceramics and Metalware, Industrial Design, Totalitarianism and the New Deal, Art Deco Revival. This impressive publication concludes with a chronology, a bibliography and an index.	2003-11-11

It is a philosophical introduction to the questions of space and time, written to stimulate further thought on the paradoxes of these concepts, in other words, to look again at the conceptual questions and puzzles that our ordinary view of space and time presents.<br />The questions that the author considers include the following: Are space and mind just mental constructions? Is there a fourth spatial dimension? Do parallel worlds exist? Could time run backwards? Might time travel be possible? Could space exist with nothing in it? Could there be space beyond the universe? and, Did time have a beginning?<br />Le Poidevin guides the reader through these puzzles with lots of wit in an engaging writing style. Best of all, he makes clear the limitations of our ordinary ideas of space and time and provides us with the tools to think about these problems with a broader brush. He does this by using only a modest amount of physics, so no prior knowledge of science or philosophy is required to enjoy the book.<br />He also deals with the Fine Tuning of the universe. Even slight differences in the fundamental physical features of the universe (such as in the forces that bind atoms together, the masses of particles, electromagnetic equations and the rate of expansion in the early universe) would have made it impossible for life as we know it to evolve in the universe.<br />Similar thought-provoking books include Small World by Mark Buchanan, Hidden Connections by Fritjof Capra, The Universe Next Door by Marcus Chown, Before The Beginning by Martin Rees, Time And Space by Barry Dainton and God's Equation by Amir Aczel.	2003-11-08

They operate through the media, special-interest groups and the power elite that uses perpetual victimhood combined with speech and thought control to gain and hold power. This is even more destructive when it is done by the Left, the political wing that claims to be the protector of free speech and personal liberty.<br /><br />The author writes from the belly of the beast, so to speak, as she was president of the LA chapter of the National Organisation for Women and experienced these activities at first hand. At the heart of Thought Police activity is the argument that certain types of speech and the expression of certain opinions hurt certain groups and as a result should be restricted. The explicit message comes in the form of politically correct speech codes while implicitly the message is to remain silent when the virtual assassination of those who oppose the Left's status quo takes place, as in the case of Dr. Laura Schlessinger.<br /><br />Bruce shares her unique experiences on the inside of a social movement and dispels the myth that only the Left's prevailing opinions are valid. She encourages the reader to think for herself/himself and to bravely explore their own opinions and conclusions about significant and controversial social issues. The book is an appeal for reclaiming ourselves and our culture from the self-appointed Kommissars.<br /><br />She deals with the evolution of political correctness and its speech codes, contrasting the difference between the Lockean ideal of classical liberalism and today's Left, while exposing the hidden socialist sympathies of feminists like Betty Friedan and others. She demonstrates how the Left has become a mind control cult with the sole purpose of perpetuating itself.  Her investigation of the concept of \\"hate crimes\\" is astute and enlightening as is her analysis of Groupthink.<br /><br />Her writing is engaging and often humorous, as in the chapter in multiculturalism which she calls \\"the Thought Police in costume.\\" Throughout, she brilliantly exposes the hypocrisy of certain groups and individuals. She also shines a piercing light on the double standards in the news media, the entertainment industry and academia, with reference to the disgusting book American Psycho and the OJ Simpson case.<br /><br />The book ends on an optimistic note with example of successful social activism that was meant to empower and achieved great results and a section on the power of the individual to adhere to sound values and morals. The book concludes with copious notes, a thorough index and a bibliography that includes Hannah Arendt, Andrea Dworkin, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell.<br /><br />Other must-read books of related interest include [[ASIN:1930865473 In Defense of Global Capitalism]] by Johan Norberg, [[ASIN:0787978035 The New Anti-Semitism]] by Phyllis Chesler, Tales From The Left Coast by James L.

It deals with mankind's place in the cosmos and his relationship with the other forces in the visible and invisible worlds. Our inner relationship with three ancient symbols: the eagle, the lion and the bull is interestingly explored as is our connectedness with the plant and animal kingdoms in general in the context of planetary and cosmic evolution.<br />A really fascinating section follows on the elemental nature spirits. Steiner describes these metaphysical beings in detail and explains their work with plants and animals and how they co-operate with mankind. Finally he investigates the place of the human being at the heart of the cosmic process.<br />The work is divided into the following chapters: 1. Man's connection with the cosmos, earth and the animals. 2. The inner connection of world phenomena and the essential nature of the world. 3. The plant world and the nature spirits. 4. The secrets of the human organism.<br />The Harmony Of The Creative World is a fascinating read for those interested in the esoteric and those who would have a better understanding of the relationship between the seen and the unseen. Steiner was a great visionary and his life and ideas bore good fruit. This is a thought provoking and uplifting read.	2003-10-25

The story of his quest is quite dramatic, as all the direct research material that he acquired initially was stolen and he had to start again from scratch without the direct source material. The book is thus based on public writings and interviews, the historical record, the music and conversations with staff, business associates, family, friends and lovers of Lennon, including Yoko, Sean and Julian.<br />He retraces Lennon's steps through Liverpool, London, New York and Bermuda and tries to paint a picture of daily life in the Dakota building overlooking Central Park. It is interesting to know that John read the 3 New York Dailies but also loved the supermarket tabloids like the National Enquirer, Midnight Globe and the National Star. The book is quite detailed on the recording process of the Double Fantasy album.<br />The last chapters narrate the murder of Lennon by Mark Chapman and the trial, at which Chapman quoted from Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye.<br />It is an interesting book but it must be noted that lots of it is based on the author's imagination and shouldn't be taken as fact. A gripping read, nevertheless, and the text is made accessible to students of Lennon's life by a thorough index.	2003-10-25

Mercier's book is no exception.<br />The introduction explains the concept of auric energy fields and the next chapter discusses the focused energy fields, the vortices within these fields that are the chakras and how they are connected to the endocrine and central nervous systems and the spine.<br />The Indian tradition is discussed next, with reference to Yoga, and then each chakra is investigated in depth with beautiful illustrations and the appropriate meditations.<br />The book includes a chapter on charkas and sound - each chakra responds to the primal vibration of sound through mantras, chanting, toning, singing, musical scales and specific instruments.<br />The chapter A New Awareness explores beyond the 7 well-known chakras into a new state of consciousness. Here the additional charkas are discussed: Earth Star, Navel (hara), Causal, Soul Star and Stellar Gateway that exist as potentialities within the sequence of the seven.<br />The chapter Chakras and Sacred Stones looks at the correspondences with crystals whilst the last chapter deals with healing the body and mind.<br />The text is richly enhanced by brilliant paintings, photographs and illustrations, including illustrated exercises, and the book concludes with a bibliography and index.	2003-10-25

He also explores the question of how the ancient wisdom may be made more accessible today in order to harness its full power, and how practitioners can be trained and supported.<br />Other topics include the role of the mind in health and healing, training the mind for meditation and practical advice on following the spiritual path in the stressful modern world. His valuable advice provides a way of avoiding misunderstandings and delusions (how to recognize doubt and suspicion for what they are) and how to find confidence and strength every day.<br />The chapter on the spirit of Tibetan medicine is likewise interesting and enlightening. This might be a little book but it deals with big issues of balance and spiritually that will be of great value to everyone on the spiritual path, not only Buddhists. I highly recommend it.	2003-10-25

An example of each language is provided, plus a brief note on the people who speak it and a history of Bible translation in that language. Where of special interest, accounts are given of how certain languages were first written and of those involved in the translation process.<br />In his interesting introduction, Dr. Eugene A.

There are also early black and white illustrations like A la Recherche du Shoe Perdu (1955) and Young Man With A Flower (1957).<br />Of course, it includes all his most famous works like Soup Cans, Green Coca-Cola Bottles, Triple Elvis, Marilyn Diptych, Gold Marilyn, Marilyn Monroe's Lips, Mona Lisa, Brillo Boxes, Campbell's Soup Multicoloured, Dollar Signs and others. All of the works of art reproduced here are discussed in detail and often illuminated with quotes from Warhol himself.<br />The insightful introduction examines Warhol life and work from his birth in 1928 to his death in 1987. I found the sections on his association with The Velvet Underground, his films like Chelsea Girls, Trash, Flesh and I, A Man, most interesting. There is a reproduction of a still from the film Trash (1970), showing Joe Dallesandro and Holly Woodlawn.<br />The assassination attempt by Valerie Solanas is covered in detail, making for gripping history. The author claims that it took a deep psychological toll, greatly heightening Warhol's feeling that both life and art were senseless.<br />The book concludes with a Chronology, Photograph Credits, List of Plates and Selected Bibliography. Warhol as painter, printmaker, sculptor and filmmaker remains my favorite artist of the 20th century and this book does full justice to his genius.<br />Fans of Warhol would also benefit by investigating the album Songs For Drella by John Cale and Lou Reed. The tracks Forever Changed and Hello It's Me capture his spirit very well.	2003-10-21

The epilogue contains a novel view on four different categories of illness, the methods of discerning these and the proper treatments. This is a great book on shamanism, dream power, sorcery and healing that will definitely appeal to fans of the author Castaneda.	2003-10-04

The author makes a good case for having solved the riddle of the purpose of the Great Pyramid. He claims the pyramid was a large acoustical device in which the technology of harmonic resonance was used to convert the earth's vibrational energies to microwave radiation. He demonstrates the fact that the chambers and passages in the pyramid were positioned with deliberate precision to optimise its acoustical properties. When the pyramid was vibrating in tune with the earth's pulse it became a coupled oscillator that could carry the transfer of power from the earth with little or no feedback, while the three smaller pyramids on the Giza plateau could have been used to help the Great Pyramid achieve the required resonance. The King's Chamber, built of igneous granite containing silicon quartz crystals, served as the power centre while the Queen's Chamber was used to generate hydrogen, the fuel that ran the plant. Certain artefacts reveal that the ancient Egyptians used advanced machining methods. The latest discoveries, including the door found in an airshaft by Gantenbrink's Upuaut robot, fits well into this power plant theory and the author also refers to the work of Robert Bauval and Graham Hancock. The text is illustrated with black and white drawings and photographs and it concludes with copious notes, a bibliography and an index. The book is well researched, well written and in my opinion the theory is plausible and ought to be investigated further.	2003-09-06

Many networks that seemed to be random are turning out to have a hidden order as revealed by the discipline of Complexity Theory.<br />The most interesting sections are those on the Internet, on the spread of AIDS and on economic systems.

John Berryman himself compiled this selection from his published poetry, to serve as both an introduction to his work and a summary of his poetic career. The book consists of five sections, with poems from The Dispossessed (1948), His Thought Made Pockets (1958), Berryman's Sonnets (952, 1967), Homage To Mistress Bradstreet (1953) and The Dream Songs (1964, 1968). My favorite poems come mostly from The Dispossessed. These include The Moon And The Night And The Men with its chilling end line: \\"and the war goes on, and the moon in the breast of man is cold\\" and the two songs: The Song Of The Demented Priest and The Song Of The Tortured Girl. The latter appears to be about a girl undergoing electroshock therapy and also contains images about camping out in a mountain pass, with the mention of a winter when the young men stayed away. For some reason, this reminds me of John Cale's song Ski Patrol from his album Slow Dazzle - it has the same poignant feel, only in John Cale's song the ski patrol does come around to make sure everyone's alright. From Berryman's Sonnets, I love most Number 34 which starts out like a conversation between a man and his wife but develops into a chilling vision of the holiest of holies in Solomon's temple in Jerusalem. Strange and powerful indeed. John  Berryman, Anne Sexton and Robert Lowell are my favorite poets in any language, for their evocative imagery and their rhythmic, flowing lines.	2003-08-25

It purports to be an 11-lesson course on crystal gazing, clairvoyance, dematerialization and other supernatural skills. What it really is, is an introduction by Dragonstar dealing in a cursory fashion with channelling, ESP, coincidences, hunches, predictions etc. The main body of the book is by Sir William Walker Atkinson and is set in old-fashioned typography. It deals with the astral body and is abilities. Chapter headings include The Nature Of Psychomancy, How To Develop Yourself, The Astral Tube, Psychometry, Crystal Gazing &amp; Astral Projection. Atkinson's work might have been a classic when first published many years ago, but it reveals nothing new and provides no new insights, consisting mainly of short case studies. There are zillions of better books on the subject nowadays.

The author calls this \\"the God spot\\" and claims that this region is instrumental in facilitating mind-body healing, is responsible for mystical visions, psychic powers and vivid spiritual experiences.<br /><br />His study of NDE's has revealed that we have the biological potential to interact with the universe at any time in our lives. It is thus important to learn how to activate the right temporal lobe. The author's studies demonstrate that children who have had NDE's are more balanced in their physical, mental and spiritual lives. They feel a purpose in living and do not fear death. Trusting their intuition, they feel that they can again connect with the divine presence without brushing with death again.<br /><br />These children develop certain habits later in life that the author calls the ten secrets of happiness: exercise, pay attention to your life patterns, family and relationships, trust your intuition, service to others, financial planning, healthy diet, meditation/prayer, learning to love and spirituality.<br /><br />He also discusses the scientific theories of people like Dr Karl Pribram, Michael Talbot and others and looks at cases of reincarnation that defy easy explanation, synchronicity and spiritual healing and comes to the conclusion that consciousness ripples throughout reality like a pebble in a pond.<br /><br />Morse believes that early humans were too dominated by the right temporal lobe so that individuality was not fully expressed. Modern man is too left-brain dominated so that people become too isolated. NDE's remind us that we are interconnected spiritual beings as well as unique individuals. He concludes with an appeal to us to learn to use more of our mind in order to transcend the five senses and reach for an expanded human consciousness, a type of sixth sense.<br /><br />Much helpful advice is given on how to become well and stay balanced and optimistic.

This collaboration between Roger Coghill, a Cambridge scientist, and Harry Oldfield, a leading researcher in Kirlian photography and electrotherapy, propose that each organic cell has a unique radio frequency that is determined and controlled by the brain of the organism of which it forms part.<br />They further postulate that diseases can be induced by external electromagnetic waves and also cured by these waves. By using Kirlian photography this process is made visible and on can see the dark side of the brain whose working is not generally perceived. The book thus explores the effects of a hidden mechanism of the brain that works on electromagnetic principles and is becoming ever more prominent in alternative health circles.<br />The chapter Life Energies: The Pioneers, provides a list of early researchers into bio-electric life fields, like Franz Mesmer, Ruth Drown, Wilhelm Reich and others and tells the story of how they were persecuted. Royal Rife, inventor of the Rife Resonator, should be added to the list. This chapter also discusses the work of Edward Bach (of the flower remedies fame) and touches upon the life and inventions of Nikola Tesla.<br />The work of Harry Oldfield is explained in chapter 4 whilst the next chapter looks at morphogenetic fields with special reference to Rupert Sheldrake. Chapter 6 looks at the diagnosis of disease using an instrument developed from the ideas based on the Kirlian method and describes the use of pulsed high-frequency electric currents, amplified by quartz crystals, in the treatment of disease.<br />Nutrition is discussed in chapter 7, especially the beneficial effects of raw fruits and vegetables.  The authors propose that ingesting raw food strengthens the existing oscillations o the ingesting organism in a way that cooked foods do not. This section contains the most beautiful color plates demonstrating the Kirlian fields of various fruits, vegetables and the herb ginseng and provides a list of cooking processes in declining order of residual Kirlian corona discharge. Cooking and steaming seem to be the best methods whilst microwave coking comes in at a surprising third place. Oven baking appears to be the worst method. Concerning methods of preservation, raw food is tops, followed by refrigerator cooling for four hours.

An interesting foreword by Gareth Knight discusses Fortune's place in metaphysical thought, declaring her a great synthesist ever holding a balance between the strands of hermetic occultism, devotional mysticism and nature mysticism. Knight even refers to Tolkien's account of creation in The Silmarillion as reflecting Fortune's approach to certain metaphysical questions! The book provides information on how the initiate prepares the mind, spirit and body for the journey on the esoteric path and what the path of initiation looks like. The book is divided into three parts: Ethical, Theoretical and Practical. It details the way of initiation, preparations and daily life upon the path and provides a ground plan of illumination. There is also valuable information on the training of the mind and the body. I found the discussion of the relationship between natural and esoteric science very insightful and her division of what she terms \\"illuminism\\" into two branches - mysticism and occultism, very informative. According to the author, mysticism aims at the speediest possible attainment of the divine union of the soul with its source and in order to achieve this it eliminates all that causes separation. Occultism on the other hand, aims to organise and master phenomena and bring them into harmony with the eternal law of the real. Ultimately, the difference is only a matter of temperament. Fortune then proceeds to classify religions and movements like Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Theosophy, Spiritualism, Christian Science and New Thought into these two branches. The chapter on the Western Esoteric Systems deals with the Qabalistic, Greek and Egyptian traditions, claiming that they all contributed to modern Western esotericism that in addition, also draws on Eastern thought. The book contains a Tabular Classification of Illuminism demonstrating the mystical/occult division in detail as well as an index and a short biography and portrait of Fortune. This is a well written book explaining most of the important points of the occult path and the practice of sane occultism. Highly recommended.ssification of Illuminism demonstrating the mystical/occult division in detail as well as an index and a short biography and portrait of Fortune.

The author discusses personalities like W.B Yeats, Israel Regardie, Aleister Crowley, MacGregor Mathers and Dion Fortune. He discuses the survival of the underground magical tradition, Masonic Rosicrucians and the founding of the Golden Dawn. He gives an account of the frequent quarrels between the leading personalities and how various groups split up into new orders. There are interesting pieces on topics as diverse as Rudolf Steiner, the contemporary witch cult and Austin Osman Spare, but only a cursory reference to Chaos Magick. The eight appendices provide information on, inter alia, Mathers' version of the Grimoires, the identity of Steiner's teachings plus the Golden Dawn's Official history Lecture. The book is very informative and revealing. What I find puzzling about some of these characters, is that their personal lives did not reflect the high ideals of so-called High Magick. Some of them were downright unsavoury characters and there were scandals galore. Before I taint everyone with the same brush, I must add that this does not seem to have been true for Steiner and Fortune. The omission of any reference to the Ogdoadic tradition and Aurum Solis in particular, is a flaw and makes this work incomplete. The book concludes with a bibliography, reading list and a notes section on sources.	2003-07-07

And not only for those who consider Discordianism as a form - albeit a weird one - of Gnosticism. Certain passages are more inspiring than others, like &quot;The Enlightenment Of Zarathud&quot; and Lord Omar's &quot;Epistle To The Paranoids&quot;, although only the orthodox version of the latter appears here. According to the Samaritan Codex and the Octuagint there is an additional verse which reads: &quot;Ye build high buildings, only to cast yeself from the roofs.&quot; The same Codex (but not the Octuagint) also contains &quot;The Epistle To The Neurotics&quot; by St. Euthanasius that sadly didn't make it into this edition. These minor gripes aside, I do recommend this work to all those who are searching for the meaning of life, the universe and everything. Eris, goddess of Chaos, is ready, willing and able to help you. For more information about spirituality and chaos, read Peter Carroll's Liber Kaos or Liber Null And Psychonaut. And if you appreciate this type of humour, you will love the work of Robert Anton Wilson.	2003-07-01

This book explains the significance of sigils, how to create them and how to charge them with psychic power. The work is divided in two parts: The Psybermancer and The Psybernomicon. The first deals with the basics of magick, critical self-analysis, magical preliminaries including the altar and equipment, rituals and formulas, the creation of sigils and a discussion of inhibitory an excitatory gnosis. The author provides extensive information on whirling gnosis and charging methods for the sigils. Chapter Six: The Master Ritual includes pieces on words of power, the use of sound and the colors of magick. The Psybernomicon examines the concept of color in magick in detail, including white, red, black orange, green, blue, yellow and silver, and the last chapter provides magical techniques and exercises. The book concludes with a bibliography and index. I found it to be quite an enjoyable read with simple instructions and sound advice.	2003-06-29

The chapters on dreams include a poem by Robert Browning, discussions of the work of psychologist William James and various accounts of near death experiences. Chapter Seven has interesting discussions of the pineal gland and on mantras, whilst Chapter Eight states the purpose of the book as an attempt to lessen the stranglehold that the dogmatic beliefs of science exert on our minds and the conviction that the power of imagination will soon change our lives for the better.

In them, Steiner attempted to elucidate the modifications that the human being undergoes when practicing the exercises provided in his books Knowledge Of The Higher Worlds and Occult Science - An Outline. He thus goes into the minutest of detail in describing the physical changes, which includes becoming inwardly more mobile and more vitally alive. Different kinds of foods are also discussed. Lecture 3 deals with the etheric changes with special reference to the senses, whilst Lecture 4 deals with time and the seasons. Lecture 7 contains an interesting look at the Manichaean Bishop Faustinus, the 16th century personality Johannes Faust and Goethe's Faust. Lecture 8 deals with cosmic consciousness or the paradise imagination as Steiner calls it. He concludes with an encouragement to those pursuing esoteric development, that it is the right thing to do and in harmony with the evolution of the universe. I found the book to be very technical, detailed and a bit long-winded, perhaps because I do not understand all the terminology and references. I have the highest regard for this writer, but unless you're familiar with Theosophy this book will be difficult to read. Many of his other works are more accessible and digestible to the average reader.	2003-06-29

The artist has become a shaman, venturing into the inner space in order to find and define a greater reality. With the revival of metaphysical and occult beliefs in our modern technological society, we have gone full circle, since our culture was born in magic and mystery. Through the centuries, and especially so since the growth of rational thought, we have transformed myth into history, magic into reason and mystery into technology. Despite the construction of a complex mechanistic environment in our urban sprawl, certain philosophies of reaction have emerged and some of these may be grouped together in what has been termed &quot;the consciousness movement.&quot; This is a body of attitudes and views which challenges the prevailing scientific world-view in terms of its pre-eminence as a belief system. The consciousness movement is asking questions like: What is the most complete span of perception accessible to man, what is his most deeply felt sense of reality and what does it consist of? The relevance of the current magical revival clearly lies in its inclination towards discovering the primal impulses of the Western creative imagination. The author weaves together a whole spectrum of creative manifestations, from the Tarot and Salvador Dali, to Jung, the Golden dawn and Pink Floyd, charting the riches of a subconscious world that we are endeavouring to bring to consciousness as never before. For those interested in popular music, the chapter titled The Rise of Cosmic Music offers a feast of reading. It discusses, amongst others, the music of Steppenwolf, Donovan, Mick Jagger, David Bowie, King Crimson, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Santana, Peter Hammill, Bo Hansson's music inspired by Lord of the Rings, the German Electronic Music of bands like Tangerine Dream, Peter Baumann and Klaus Schulze. We are living in interesting times, in an era where we may experience major transformations in the consensus reality. The emergence of a far-ranging and eclectic cosmology to mirror the shifts in our everyday world-view will not be far behind. Drury allows us to see the bigger picture and has done an excellent job. The book concludes with notes, a bibliography and an index. Black and White reproductions of beautiful and sometimes frightening paintings grace the middle section of the book. My favorites include Wilfried Satty's &quot;Child and Signs in the Sky&quot; &amp; &quot;Gemstone&quot;, Max Ernst's &quot;Birth of the Galaxy&quot;, Diana Vandenberg's &quot;Rex et Regina II&quot;, Rosaleen Norton's &quot;Individuation&quot;, and T.

The author looks at ancient cultures and certain symbols in the Hindu scriptures, Judaism, Christianity and Alchemy. He believes this Amanita mushroom was the soma of the ancient Vedic people according to his interpretation of certain passages from the Rig Veda. He discusses the work of entheogenic pioneer R Gordon Wasson and then discusses the following prophets of Israel in detail: Moses, Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah and Ezekiel. With the exception of Ezekiel's visions, I did not find his ideas convincing in this regard. He seems to find mushroom references everywhere! That includes the Song Of Songs, a book he claims is a song \\"in praise of the divine mushroom.&quot; Hmmm, I don't know. He also deals with the story of Jesus, the last supper, crucifixion etc. and here too, I think the author is stretching it a bit. The chapter on Gnosticism, the Dead Sea Scrolls, The Nag Hammadi scriptures, especially books like the Gospel of Truth, the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip, the Apocalypse of Adam and the Apocryphon of James is very engaging, thorough and quite insightful. He also covers the Grail Legend and claim the philosopher's stone was none other than the fly agaric mushroom. The author then describes his ingestion of the sacred mushroom over a period of 31 days, when he finally had a brilliant and transformational numinous experience on the last day, as an example of heaven. He also describes a bad trip when he became nauseous and had a deeply unpleasant experience. He concludes with the observation that the proper use of entheogens requires maturity, education, instruction and guidance plus a safe and protected setting. He is convinced that the informed use of these substances challenges any system of dogma or brainwashing and claims that the expanded consciousness is a genie that cannot be put back in the bottle. The final message of the book is that heaven is worth the trip. This book was great reading and although I think the author tries too hard to see a mushroom under every myth, he writes with style and offers many valuable insights. Plenty of figures, black and white illustrations and full colour photographs enliven the text and the book concludes with an index.the expanded consciousness is a genie that cannot be put back in the bottle.

He expertly links the latest scientific thinking in the fields of physics and cosmology with fascinating experiences and phenomena in the realm of the paranormal. To my mind, he succeeds in formulating a coherent general occult theory that holds water. He echoes the thoughts of other writers in the field of consciousness and cosmology, that we are evolving and are fast approaching the edge of a quantum leap into a vastly expanded human consciousness. I loved his discussion of mystics, writers and artists like Gurdjieff, Graham Greene and Sartre. In particular, I enjoyed his dissection of existentialist writers like Sartre and their negative view of the world, as a case of experiencing a reduced consciousness. The peak experience on the other hand, is the result of expanded consciousness and can be cultivated successfully. I was fascinated by many of his ideas, like the one that human beings are colonists in the world of matter, like a vanguard sent in to explore this reality. There are fascinating speculations on the nature of time, parallel universes or other dimension and the question of whether we are only dealing with aspects of the human psyche or whether conscious entities are real. The work of scientists like Niels Bohr, David Bohm and Kark Pribram is discussed, including theory of the hologramatic universe. His research is quite rigorous and sometimes the text may appear a bit repetitive as he returns again and again to earlier examples from literature of from real life experiences to make a point or a connection. Ultimately this is necessary for the book to work as well as it does. His conclusion is that the majority of mankind accepts mental stagnation as a norm (ordinary consciousness being stagnation) and makes no effort to build its insights into a pyramid. When this situation changes, humans will enter the next stage of evolution. The book concludes with a vast bibliography and a detailed index. Beyond The Occult remains a stimulating and mind expanding read and I recommend it to all people who are interested in cosmology, consciousness and spirituality.ccepts mental stagnation as a norm (ordinary consciousness being stagnation) and makes no effort to build its insights into a pyramid.

This is a charming collection of classical Sanskrit verse composed between the 4th and 10th centuries A.D. The introduction explains the term Classical Sanskrit, the sources of the book, the general problem of translation and some of the special problems; these include Sanskrit's capacity for building very long nominal compounds that are frequently used in poetry plus the abundance of synonyms which poets had at their disposal. Poetical conventions as well as metres and rhyming effects are also covered. The English translations are rhythmic and evocative, in other words, good poetry not direct translations. Some are quite stunning, like this sweet little thing by an unknown author elegantly rendered into English by the translator John Brough: \\"A lover reunited with his darling, the bee clings close and kisses the mango-blossom.\\" There are poems devoted to the romantic and the sensual and many of a philosophical nature too, like this gem: \\"Rise early son/Ponder your acts, think of the world to come:/For be assured, the fruits of all you do/Will think on you.\\"  The book contains an extensive list of references to the Sanskrit originals. I think Brough has done a great job in making Sanskrit poetry come alive in such delightful English.	2003-06-18

The book concludes with short biographical notes on each of the poets. This is quite a good introduction to classical Arab poetry for the student of Arabic literature.

Li Po was a spiritual poet whose verse deals with consciousness and the human mind, whilst Tu Fu was a chronicler of the everyday life. The book includes a thorough introduction encompassing the pronunciation of Chinese words and names, notes on the Chinese calligraphy and the introduction proper which provides information on the poets and their times, plus backgrounds to T'ang Poetry and the principles of Chinese syllabic metre. The poems are elucidated with explanatory notes and with reference to Ezra Pound's translations in his book Cathay. In this regard, I found here another translation of Li Po's poem The Ballad Of Ch'ang-Kan (The Sailor's Wife) the first part of which was translated as The River Merchant's Wife: A Letter, by Pound. This is a beautiful poem and I was very pleased to find the second part here. Although there is no unanimity amongst scholars that it really is by Li Po, it perfectly completes the first part and Cooper's notes here are very illuminating, especially as regards place names on the Yangtse river.

Explaining the fact that each individual has two minds, the conscious and the subconscious, it proceeds to explain the function of each and how powerful the subconscious is. The great subconscious power must however be directed by the conscious mind, and that is the individual's responsibility. The various techniques for directing the subconscious, like affirmation and visualization, are clearly explained. Many helpful affirmations are provided to kick-start the process of healing and many examples are provided of how people solved their problems by correcting their thinking. This inspiring book is immensely therapeutic in cleaning cobwebs and dogmatic brainwashing from the mind. I recommend this as the very best entry point in the entire field of self-improvement. I also recommend [[ASIN:1567183395 Mind Magic Techniques for Transforming Your Life]] by Marta Hiatt. Other authors whose work is also of great benefit in this regard, include [[ASIN:0875165311 Catherine Ponder]], Louise Hay, [[ASIN:B000NTIPIW Emmet Fox]] and Frederick Bailes. Joseph Murphy's books on cultivating a consciousness of prosperity are very helpful too.	2003-06-15

In this book the author revises the period of the Chaldean or Neo-Babylonian empire. He makes a rather convincing case that these Chaldeans were not indigenous to the city of Babylon and that they were really the Hittites of Asia Minor. He draws parallels between the emperors of Babylon and the Chaldean kings. At the same time in Egypt, Velikovsky identifies the 19th dynasty of Seti and Ramses with the 26th dynasty of Psamtik, Necho and Apries.<br />This period in Velikovsky's revised history starts with the first confrontation between what the author considers the contemporaries Ramses II and Nebuchadnezzar and ends with the Persian conquest of Libya and Egypt, from where the story continues in the aforementioned book Peoples Of The Sea. In between there are informative discussions of the origin of the alphabet, the pictographic script of the Hittites, the ruins of Yazilikaya and other monuments of Asia Minor, the Israel stele of Mernepthah and the lamentations of Jeremiah.<br />The epilogue is devoted to the counterarguments that Velokovsky expected from the critics. The pieces here include titles like Tanis And Sais, How Long Did Seti And Ramses II Reign?, Two Suppiluliumas, Bronze And Iron, Scarabs And Stratigraphy. The synchronical tables that follow lays out his revised history of this era for Egypt, Judah, Chaldea, Lydia-Phrygia, Media-Persia and Greece.<br />There are 30 black and white illustrations including the Steles of Essarhaddon and Ramses II at Nahr El Kelb, the sarcophagus of Ahiram, The Lion Gate Of Hattussas, The Israel Stele Of Merneptah and The Mummy Of Ramses II. The book concludes with a thorough index.<br />The fact that Ramses II lived at the end of the 7th century BC and was the same person as Pharao Necho II of the Scriptures may not be widely accepted, but Velikovsky's brilliant writing style certainly sparked a renewed interest in ancient history and still provides great reading pleasure. I recommend this classic of alternative history to all readers who are interested in the ancient history of the Middle East, Egyptology and biblical archaeology.ked a renewed interest in ancient history and still provides great reading pleasure.

But why an Irish name? For some reason, this musical language and the magical legends of Ireland have become very popular in the Anglo-Saxon world and further afield. The introduction discusses trends in the giving of names and mentions the most popular current Irish names. The chapter Little Dark One provides a cursory history of the settling of Ireland by the Celts and then lists and explains suitable names for dark haired people, such as Darcy, Douglas and Duane. In the chapter The Fairest Of Them All there's mention of the Tuatha De Danaan and a discussion of names like Barry, Finbar, Kelly, etc. Red haired people are treated in the next chapters, where some of the more common names are Rory and Rowan, whilst the next chapter deals with names deriving from the root words for light or brightness; these include Aidan and Keegan. A Celtic Menagerie provides names that are connected with animal names or qualities: here you will find Colm, Conan, Conor, Oscar and Ronan. In the chapter titled The Green Isle, names derived from plants are given, including Darren and Tyrone. Warrior names in the next chapter include Casey, Fergal and Kane. Wednesday's Child provides names for less worthy traits, like Doran, Etain and Kennedy. Banshee names include Bevin, Cliona and Una, while names invented by authors include Fiona, Gulliver, Imogen and Vanessa. The next chapter discusses and lists the retranslation back into Irish, of popular Anglophonic names and also provides a list of Irish names with their English translations. The A - Z index lists all the names and their meanings/histories alphabetically and is followed by a calendar of saints' feast days. This interesting read and valuable reference work concludes with a thorough index.	2003-06-10

It deals with a wide range of diverse topics such as creation myths, sacred journeys and pilgrimages, features of the landscape like stones and meteors, rock formations, caves, crevices, mountains and volcanoes. There are detailed discussions of places like Avebury, Bath, Delphi, Machu Picchu, Newgrange and the Ganges river. Other subjects include minerals, metals, precious stones, trees, groves, standing stones and circles, megalithic cultures, the pyramids (with a separate section on the great pyramid), early cave art and Lascaux in particular. There is even a discussion of Feng Shui! Most of the 250 illustrations are in full colour, all are impressive. Van Gogh's Starry Night is beautifully reproduced, and the book concludes with a glossary, bibliography and index. Sacred earth is a little masterpiece, it provides fascinating reading and serves as a unique reference work to our planet's places of peace and power and also mankind's efforts to reach out to the divine over thousands of years. Those who love symbolist or esoteric art will find it especially valuable, an inspirational treasure trove.	2003-06-07

It also includes writings by Timothy Leary, Laura Huxley and Dr. Humphry Osmond. Leary's interesting account of a 1960 meeting with Huxley at Cambridge is titled Mushrooms For Lunch, whilst the same year's Harvard Sessions is a report of a psylocybin session where Huxley took part in a group experiment. Other very thought provoking chapters include Dr. Humphry Osmond's May Morning In Hollywood and Huxley's own Disregarded In The Darkness, Doors, Mescalin, Heaven And Hell and Brave New World Revisited. But the highlights of the book are Laura Huxley's 1962 account of her husband in a psychedelic state and especially her moving account of his illness and death, titled Nobly Born. The appendix is titled Instruments For Use During A Psychedelic Experience and the book concludes with an index. This is a brilliant collection of this refined author's best work and an insightful investigation into the use of entheogenic substances for the expansion of consciousness. I also recommend Huston Smith's Cleansing The Doors Of Perception: The Religious Significance of Entheogentic Plants and Chemicals, William James' Varieties Of Religious Experience the title Chaos, Creativity and Cosmic Consciousness by Ralph Abraham, Terence McKenna and Rupert Sheldrake.	2003-06-07

The book opens with the poem Rowing and ends with The Rowing Endeth and inbetween are extraordinarily powerful poems about life, death, despair, the suicidal impulsive and mercifully about love too. Referring to herself as Ms Dog, the author very honestly examines her psyche in poems like The Civil War, The Room Of My Life and The Witch's Life, a poem that continues a theme established by Her Kind in the first volume To Bedlam And Part Way Back and continued through The Black Art in All My Pretty Ones. A poem like Courage overflows with hurt but has a transcendent quality too and the same duality or conflict becomes very clear in the poem After Auschwitz, where she declares: \\"Man ... / .../ is not a temple/but an outhouse\\", proceeding to curse mankind, before concluding with: \\"I say these things aloud./ I beg the Lord not to hear.\\" The Poet Of Ignorance is painful to read as the arresting image of an indestructible crab gripping the poet's heart becomes a metaphor for mental pain. This oppressive image is reiterated in The Dead Heart, where the tongue did the killing, a theme more delicately investigated in the next poem, Words. The following one, The Sickness Unto Death, must be one of the bleakest poems in the English language in its seemingly casual wrestling with evil and utter despair. The line \\"My body became a side of mutton/and despair roamed the slaughterhouse\\" perhaps best encapsulates the unrelenting torment. Mercifully, poems like Welcome Morning - a description of a burst of domestic joy - and The Big Heart - where the \\"fury of love\\" for friends and family rushes into her heart, show the other side of Sexton's intensity of feeling. The Awful Rowing Toward God was the last book to be arranged by the author herself and is not recommended for the fragile reader. It reflects the agonizing search for meaning that is so universal to the individual consciousness. But perhaps because of the intensity, some of the musical rhythm of her work from especially the two aforementioned books is missing here. There is still the conversational style, but it would appear that the large crab gripping Sexton's heart was squeezing very hard here, suffocating all but the most unquenchable outbursts of joy like Welcome Morning.onsciousness.

There's some quirky humour in A Curse Against Elegant Elegies, especially in the image of the surly preacher who shuffled into the yard \\"looking for a scapegoat.\\" One of the most moving poems here is titled For Eleanor Boylan Talking With God, a lovely and touching description of a devout friend. And one of the saddest poems, The Truth The Dead Know, reveals the poet's feelings as she leaves church after the death of her father. The flowing structure of the poem and the resigned sense of finality are breathtaking; it reminds me of the music of Angels Of Light, especially the desolate landscape of Song For My Father on the New Mother album. The poem Old brilliantly juxtaposes the reality of a geriatric ward's needles, rubber sheets and tubes with a childhood dream of eating wild blueberries, whilst The Starry Night which opens with a quote by Vincent Van Gogh, reminds me of Sylvia Plath's Ariel and Don McLean's song Starry Starry Night. Other favourites of mine include Lament, In The Deep Museum and The Black Art which reminds me of the poem Her Kind from the first book To Bedlam And Part Way Back. All My Pretty Ones shows Anne Sexton at the height of her art and together with Bedlam, should be in every poetry lover's collection.	2003-06-01

As such this is one of the most thought-provoking studies on altered states and the nature of consciousness. The volunteers reported an amazing array of positive mystical or frightening hallucinatory experiences including encounters with intelligent entities.<br /><br />Strassman's research connects DMT with the pineal gland; this corresponds to the esoteric belief that the pineal, connected with the Crown, Keter or Sahasrara chakra, eases the spirit's movement into different levels of consciousness or various dimensions of existence. Graham Hancock's [[ASIN:1932857842 Supernatural]] similarly explores the use of psychedelics to induce altered states or allow the soul to explore other dimensions.<br /><br />Psychedelic substances in science and society, the chemical qualities and molecular structure of DMT, the pineal gland and its role in the psychedelic experience are all discussed in the first part. Part Two relates the history of the author's research, from the actual research proposal through the process of obtaining permission; this section may be skipped by the average reader.<br /><br />Next Strassman describes the process of selecting volunteers, obtaining DMT and the first experiments, whilst in Part Four he examines the case reports: what the volunteers said and did, their behavior, etc. This makes for strange and fascinating reading. Some experiences were positive and illuminating, resembling uplifting meditative states, whilst others were eerie or deeply unpleasant.<br /><br />Part Five takes stock of these reports and considers the question of whether the experience was worth the effort for each individual that took part. Strassman attempts to assess the ultimate benefit that each person derived. Definitions come into play and determining something so subjective is difficult but it would appear that the experiments did reward each individual in some way or other.<br /><br />Then follows a discussion of the soul/psyche and states of consciousness. It seems that spontaneously occurring psychedelic experiences are mediated by elevated levels of endogenous DMT. This `spiritual' molecule thus unlocks unknown territory. If the brain is a receiver, DMT fine-tunes this organ so that the individual consciousness moves beyond familiar awareness into other realms, most of which are inhabited. Many volunteers mentioned a `ripping' sound as they made the transition.<br /><br />There's a difference between this awareness and normal dreaming. Current psychological theory does not satisfactorily explain the phenomenon or the peculiar experiences, especially as regards the entities encountered. This leads to a speculative discussion on cosmology, the possibility of parallel universes, a multiverse and dark matter with reference to David Deutsch's book [[ASIN:014027541X The Fabric of Reality]].<br /><br />The author concludes his extraordinary work by looking at the practical use of psychedelics in therapy, as promoters of creativity or as entheogens (substances that trigger spiritual/religious experiences).

For example, The Waiting Head is a poignant memory of a beloved grandmother who lived alone and the poem ends with the line \\"but no one came no one came.\\" Equally poignant, but humorous too, is her description of being admitted to a mental institution. The poem is called Music Swims Back To Me and contains a repeating refrain and flowing rhythm that convey the sense of alienation particularly well. Said The Poet To The Analyst, a look at the relation between patient and therapist, is another masterpiece in its economical use of vivid images and the rhythm of the words. The poem Her Kind described the poet as the witch, inhabiting a different world and a person \\"who is not ashamed to die.\\" The Moss Of His Skin opens with a quote from Psychoanalysis And Psychoanalytic Review and is a resigned description of a terrifying occurrence, being buried alive. The musical quality of Sexton's poetry comes to the fore again in her tale of accepting the death of a friend, in the poem Elizabeth Gone, one of the most magical elegies I have ever read. Noon Walk On The Asylum Lawn integrates a line from Psalm 23 in each of the three stanzas, juxtaposing the reassuring words of protection with her own terrifying observations to eerie effect, for example, the second verse:<br />\\"The grass speaks.<br />I hear green chanting all day.<br />I will fear no evil, fear no evil<br />The blades extend<br />And reach my way.\\"<br />A sense of first hand experience lends a genuine authenticity to these poems, whilst her mastery of imagery and the natural rhythm of language is original and impressive. To Bedlam And Part Way Back and All My Pretty Ones remain her best books, since the later works became so bleak and harrowing that some of them are very painful to read and digest.	2003-06-01

Some mysterious force is accelerating the expansion of the universe, pushing out on space, countering gravity and making the universe accelerate towards infinity. Aczel argues that in addition to the four known forces: gravity, electromagnetism, the weak and the strong nuclear forces, there is a fifth: the cosmological constant which is the quintessence of the universe. He spoke to many experts in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy and cosmology and integrated the ideas of prominent scientists like Eddington, Penrose and Grossman. The chapters deal with stuff like Euclid's Riddle, Riemann's Metric, the expansion of space, the nature of matter and the geometry of the universe but it also serves as a type of biography of Einstein and a history of the development of his theories. There are quotes from Einstein' work and the text is enlivened by portraits, photographs and illustrations. Although an engaging and thought provoking text, it is sometimes difficult to grasp all of the intricacies as there are many formulas that a non-mathematician would not understand. Nevertheless a uniquely stimulating work that concludes with a helpful bibliography and thorough index.

Part One, The Nature Of Reality, considers regions of the universe where time may run backwards, infinite realities, wave functions and matterwaves plus a stuff or entity called ortho-positronium. Part Two, The Nature Of The Universe, considers invisible galaxies, stars and planets, mirror matter, the interaction between ordinary and mirror matter, black holes and their significance in the model of the universe, the possibility of intelligent life creating a universe and even how to build a universe. Relativity, quantum physics, the ideas of Hoyle and Chandrasekhar and many others are involved in the speculations. Part Three discusses the likelihood of life on earth having been seeded from space, the comet connection, life as a cosmic phenomenon and the strong possibility of finding alien artefacts on the earth and the moon. The book concludes with a glossary of terms, a reading list with separate headings for Fiction and Non-Fiction and a thorough index.

In it, James Geary discusses the advances in biotechnology and provides a glance into the future when new technologies may replace organs and repair and enhance the senses. Devices made of silicon will eventually enhance the human brain and body in ways unheard of today. In the chapter titled Sight/Vision Thing, we learn that computers will be able to analyse facial expressions for various purposes. In the chapters Hearing/Sounds Of Science and Smell/Advances In Odour Space the possibility is raised of transporting odours and flavours via the internet and if this will become just another advertising tool. There are also Taste/Fun With Electric Tongues; Touch/The World Is Your Interface, in which haptic interfaces are discussed, and finally, Mind/The Sixth Sense. The convergence of biology and technology is a fascinating field; this book also addresses some of the psychological, sociological and philosophical implications of these future technologies. The discussion on new bionic senses becoming available is very interesting, like the possibility of seeing infrared and ultraviolet light, plus the possibility of hitherto unknown senses becoming available. The whole framework of existence is changing as the human body becomes electric, opening wider the doors of perception. This great book contains 13 illustrations and concludes with an extensive bibliography and a helpful index.	2003-05-30

This classic on the power and uses of affirmation explains the laws for harnessing the power of focused thought. The first part reveals the relationship between matter/energy and mind and how one can set in motion the healing power of spirit. It also explains consciousness and matter/energy as vibratory expressions of spirit. This section on the theory of healing includes the chapters: Why Affirmations Work; Life Energy Causes the Cure; Healing Body, Mind and Soul; and, Nature of Creation. It is emphasized that thought needs soul conviction in order to yield the best results. Part Two is titled Methods Of Practice with the chapters Technique of Affirmation (with two photographs - one demonstrating the posture for affirmation and the other for that of meditation, and Scientific Healing Affirmations, which includes specific affirmations for various physical, mental or spiritual needs. Some of the purposes/conditions for which affirmations are provided include general healing, guidance, wisdom, material success, spiritual success and eyesight, stomach, teeth, purity, curing bad habits, freedom. There is an index, plus a short biography of the author plus a portrait. This title has been in print for many decades and it's easy to see why - it is a very authoritative but easily understood guide to this ancient practice. Free of esoteric jargon, it explains all aspects of the discipline clearly and comprehensively. For a very different approach to the subject, I recommend Stuart Wilde's book Affirmations. Reading both Yogananda and Wilde will tell you all you need to know about the power of affirmation and how it can improve your life.	2003-05-17

Chapter Two covers destiny and the reincarnation of the human spirit, while Chapter Three discusses other dimensions of consciousness like the soul world, the spirit world and their connection with the physical world and includes with a section on thought forms and the human aura. These worlds are not to be considered spatially, but are states of consciousness, qualitative spaces of inner relationship. Chapter Four discusses the individual's spiritual path and encourages the acquisition of spiritual knowledge with the emphasis on thinking and proving truth for oneself. Steiner sees the first step in this path of knowledge as the assimilation of scientific spiritual concepts. He asks the reader not to \\"believe\\" what he says, but to \\"think\\" it. It is not a question of belief but of experience. Here his thoughts correspond with those of Jung as explained in Stephan Hoeller's great book The Gnostic Jung And The Seven Sermons To The Dead - that mankind has a need of religious experience, not of belief. Unlike a major portion of Eastern thought which believes in the dissolution of individuality, Steiner`s view is that spiritual growth does not take place at the expense of individuality, but through its enhancement. A similar idea can be found in Thomas Troward's beautiful book The Creative Process In The Individual. I would also like to recommend the following works for those interested in spirituality: Cosmic Consciousness by R M Bucke and The Varieties Of Religious Experience by William James. Theosophy is a thought-provoking book that ought to be studied rather than read. The book concludes with a thorough index and a short biography and photograph of Rudolf Steiner. It has stimulated my interest to investigate his other works.rather than read. The book concludes with a thorough index and a short biography and photograph of Rudolf Steiner.

The interesting foreword is by author Joan Borysenko. The purpose of medical meditation is to balance the mind, body and spirit into a powerful whole, for a better, healthier life. It provides specific medical meditations for physiological effects, including special movements and postures, mantras and breathing exercises. How to activate the healing force via the chakra system is discussed in detail and the book includes a section on staying young with the help of nutrients and maintaining endocrine health with meditation. It concludes with a list of sources, recommended reading and an index. Helpful illustrations demonstrate some of the exercises. Khalsa goes into very specific detail and provides information that I have never encountered in similar books on spiritual and mental healing. I recommend this book to all practitioners of alternative healing therapies and to all people who wish to take responsibility for the own health.	2003-05-11

Part One: Singing Both Sides, looks at the Gospel and Blues roots of Soul Music, the record companies that first recorded this style, the DJs and the radio stations that played it, and includes interviews with Screamin' Jay Hawkins, [[ASIN:B00000DBVU Cissy Houston]], Ben E. King, Ahmet Ertegun, James Bown and Wilson Pickett. The pioneering work of Ray Charles features heavily here.<br /><br />Part Two: City Soul, starts with a look at the early Soul artists on Atlantic and other labels and includes the reminiscences of Jerry Wexler, includes information on Solomon Burke, Sam Cooke, Motown Records, plus interviews with Smokey Robinson, Mary Wells, [[ASIN:B001E6T654 Martha Reeves]], Diana Ross, The Temptations, The Four Tops, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson and Aretha Franklin.

It is easy to get lost in its labyrinthine pleasures, to discover how, when and where favourite songs were written, to learn about the backgrounds of the musicians, the record companies and the business people like Ertegun and Berry Gordy.<br /><br />There's a lot of human interest in the text, a lot of triumph and tragedy - Hirshey is a masterful writer who really gets into the music and compels one to reach for your CD and vinyl collections to hear these great voices again. She mostly allows the voices to speak for themselves, but in a brilliantly interwoven text where the songs, the charts, the gigs and the tours form the historical frame in which the voices reveal the human element.<br /><br />There are sixteen black and white plates with photographs of artists like Cooke, Wells, Ross, Gaye, Wonder, Lamont Dozier and the Holland Brothers, [[ASIN:B00004T6T1 Franklin]], Reeves, Junior Walker, James Brown, Don Covay and others.

Peoples of the Sea is the fourth volume in his Ages In Chaos series. The book can be read independently and it covers the nearly two centuries of Persian domination of Egypt and the early dynasties of the Ptolemies. In it, Velikovsky argues that conventional history's foundations are shaky and that Egyptian historical chronology needs to be revised. Conventional history claims that the Peoples of the Sea were barbarians who nearly destroyed civilisation before they were defeated by Pharao Ramses III in the 12th century B.C. Velikovsky instead believes that there is enough archaeological and documentary evidence to prove that they were Greek mercenaries and that their allies the Pereset weren't ancient Philisines but Persians. He argues that Ramses III was Nectanebo I of the Greek historians who lived 800 years later, and he places these events not in the 12th but in the 4th century B.C.  The peoples of the Sea were thus fourth century mercenaries from Asia Minor and Greece, of the time of Plato. He shows that there was a strong Semitic (Hebrew and Assyrian) influence on the language, religion and art of Egypt in the time of Ramses III and provides much other archaeological and documentary evidence. The book includes 16 black &amp; white plates including tiles of Ramses III, bass reliefs of the battles against the Peoples of the Sea, the pylon of the Khonsu Temple and portal of the Ramses III temple at Medinet Habu and artwork from the tomb of Si-Amon at Siwa Oasis. The main text concludes with chronological charts in parallel tables listing Persia, Palestine, the Greek World and Egypt from 550 B.C. to 340 B.C. The supplement on Astronomy and Chronology includes chapters on The Foundations of Egyptian Chronology, Sirius and Venus. With Velikovsky' dazzling erudition, Peoples Of The Sea reads like a detective story. I don't know to what extent Velikovsky's alternative chronology has been accepted or convincingly disproved but all his work is fascinating and stimulating to read, as he had the talent for making history come alive.o what extent Velikovsky's alternative chronology has been accepted or convincingly disproved but all his work is fascinating and stimulating to read, as he had the talent for making history come alive.	2003-04-21

It is divided in three parts: (1) Not-working on yourself, which explores Aboriginal dreaming and connections with quantum physics, psychology and Buddhism (2) Lucid healing - the implications of these connections and experiences with new methods of lucid dreaming and body work (3) Lucid Living - the implications of the practice of 24-hour lucid dreaming. I enjoyed the author's discussions of physicist Richard Feynman's theory of the behaviour of elementary particles as a pattern for time displacement that can be found in dreams and in quantum physics. These general patterns connect the psychology of altered states with the behaviour of particles and his explanation provides much food for thought. There is a lot of new agey stuff but overall this book is a valuable contribution to the exploration of the dream world. I have not tried the exercises yet so cannot report on their efficacy, but found this book with its plentiful black &amp; white illustrations a great read.	2003-03-29

It provides instructions on how to prepare the mother tincture and stock remedies by the sun method and the boiling method and includes a list of the remedies and their properties, from Agrimony to Willow. These entries include the common name of the flower essence, the botanical name, the indications for use, descriptions of the plant, the leaves, the flowers and the time of blooming, plus preparation methods. Every entry is graced with a beautiful colour photograph of the flower in question. The book concludes with a bibliography of books about the Bach Flower Remedies. This is not for the general reader who wish to use the remedies and want to know more about their qualities, but strictly for those who are interested in making their own. As such it will have a limited appeal but I still found it to be interesting reading. People interested in natural healing and medicinal plants will certainly find this a valuable source-book.	2003-03-29

It is an insightful look at the relationship between science and \\"unscientific\\" topics like prayer, love, laughter, work, creativity, dreams and more, an examination of consciousness and spirituality in medicine. Everybody knows that something vital is missing in modern allopathic medicine - the role of the human mind. The author points out the deep level of ignorance within science about the origin, function and destiny of human consciousness. But at last we are moving toward a vision of consciousness that liberates the mind from its identification with the physical brain and body. Of course, the implications for medicine are vast. He refers to the ideas of Jung, Ken Wilber, Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger, David Bohm and Rupert Sheldrake and makes a valid case for the fact that our power to heal and be healed extends beyond our physical bodes. The essays fall into the three categories Meaning, Mind and Nonlocality, and the book concludes with a bibliography, a section on sources and an index. This is a classic and I recommend it to all who are interested in holistic or spiritual healing and those want to take responsibility for their own health.	2003-03-29

The chapters discuss questions like What are essential oils? How to use them, The scentuous woman, The scentuous man and Synergistic blends of oils, among others. The text includes many tables of oils suitable to various body types and hair colours as well as tables recommending the right oils for a variety of conditions including tension, stress, anxiety and depression. This is quite an authoritative book on essential oils and their applications with a beautifully illustrated text. An extensive bibliography and index round off this valuable contribution to the literature on the therapeutic uses of fragrance.

This is a guide to optimising physical and psychological well-being through the use of gemstones, with reference to the disciplines of Tantra an Ayurveda. The author discusses how Indian astrologers, Ayurvedic healers and Tantric alchemists use gems in their practices and provides clear instructions for the creation of gemstone talismans and the performanc of rituals involving gems to bring about desired effects. The book serves as both a practical guide to the subtle nature of gemstones and as an overview of their use through the ages. The introduction looks at gemstones and the human race and gems and astrology, while Part 2 deals with particular stones and their ruling planets: ruby, pearl, coral, emerald, yellow sapphire, diamond, blue sapphire, hessonite and cat's eye. There is also a chapter on semi-precious stones and gems of medicinal value plus one devoted to healing with gemstones. It was interesting to learn that gems work with both Physicochemical and Pranic energy, whether the are worn as jewelry or taken orally in the form of pastes or oxides. Beautiful illustrations, Sanskrit script and figures enliven the text and there are many tables and astrological charts.	2003-03-29

It includes pieces from the US and UK pess and considers Bowie from all angles, including his stage and screen work. In the main, it avoids showbiz gossip and concentrates on his artistic contribution, although this can get a bit academic at times. Lindsay Kemp talks about his years as Bowie's mime teacher, while Ann Rice and Jon Savage discuss the gender issue. Craig Copetas' observations on Bowie and William Burroughs are fascinating, while the best quotes come from Lester Bangs (on Bowie's fear of flying), journalist Adam Sweeting and the man himself: &quot;I usually don't agree with what I say very much, I'm an awful liar&quot; confesses Bowie.

Universality in turn, shows that we are intimately connected to he universe in a most liberating sense. Universality emphasizes the interconnections between the elements of a system, whether these are the neurons in the brain or the droplets of water in a cloud. It also demonstrates that there is always a cause and that correlations can persist over very long spatial or temporal distances. The rise of universality is a result of the intellectual revolution started by chaos mathematics. In other words, universality is about the invisible force in the universe that is ubiquitous but still nameless, a force of order that is extremely powerful yet gentle. Ward examines the theories of universality, how they fit into a quest to discover the workings of the universe. He explores their possible limitations and considers what we can do with this new knowledge. He looks at the work of scientists Leo Kadanoff, Kenneth Wilson, Benoit Mandelbrot, Gene Stanley and Per Bak. The most interesting sections to me are those on the role of fractal patterns in our concept of beauty, fractals in the music of Bach and Beethoven and in Phil Thompson's work \\"Organised Chaos\\" of 1998 (which is based on the Mandelbrot set) and the determinable rhythms in finance and economics. Although modern physics is revealing more and more about particles (the very small) and the universe (the very large), it has not been focused on revealing much about the mundane and our everyday lives. Universality does this, in demonstrating how our bodies, our behaviour and nature are intimately connected. All of these different systems share a common principle, a single dynamic and a universal affinity. The author does not go into detailed discussions and theorising, for which I am grateful, as the text remains accessible enough for the general reader. What the book does reveal provides enough food for thought at this stage. The book includes portraits of the above-mentioned scientists, pictures of fractal patterns in leaves and lungs and migrating antelope, plus the fractal patterns in a work by Jackson Pollock. I recommend this book to all who are interested in cosmology, chaos theory and the golden mean (sacred geometry).food for thought at this stage.

The book is very comprehensive in cope, dealing with the full energy system and the subtle bodies: ethereal, astral, mental and spiritual, while explaining the function and purpose of the charkas. It explains how blockages develop in the charkas and how to eliminate them, before treating each of the seven chakras in detail.<br />The astrological associations are dealt with and various therapies for cleansing and activating the chakras are covered in great detail. These include sound, colour, gemstone, and aroma therapies plus colour meditation and different forms of yoga. In addition, there are chapters on chakra breathing, reflex zone massage and physical exercises for releasing blocked energies. The appendix includes tables on the charkas and their associated factors like symbols, colours, elements, hormones, musical tones and aromas.<br />The text is enlivened with many black and white figures, illustrations and tables, and the book concludes with a short bibliography. The Chakra-handbook is the most comprehensive work on the subject that I have encountered, providing practical information in a simple, easily understood manner. I highly recommend it to practitioners of esoteric healing and to all readers who are interested in familiarising themselves with their own energy bodies for a more fulfilling and abundant life.	2003-03-06

She analyses the complex human relationships in Genesis, depicting the fathers of the faith as multifaceted characters. The author maintains that Genesis is not a moral text, that it deals with separation rather than sin, and claims that the book's message is that integration and wholeness can only be achieved by the individual coming to terms with her/his own nature. The stories of Genesis have a timeless quality because they speak to parts of the spirit that remain hidden to us, yet they exert a compelling fascination. A reading of this book suggests why psychoanalysis began as a predominantly Jewish discipline. Long before modern psychology, the authors of ancient Israel had already started to investigate the unmapped territories of the human heart and mind. They considered the struggle with the emotions and with the past as the theatre of the religious quest. By seeking reconciliation with those who have hurt them in the past and by attempting to resolve inner conflicts, people would attain the harmony and peace that characterises the sacred. Because the authors of Genesis were dealing with such difficult matters, they provided very few exact teachings or simple messages, no clear theology and no shared consensus. Even though Genesis has played such an important role in shaping the Judeo-Christian tradition, the book can often challenge our religious preconceptions and like all human reflections on the divine, it cannot adequately express the often confusing reality to which it directs our focus. Armstrong's work is always thought provoking and this book is no exception. In The Beginning concludes with a helpful bibliography and index.	2003-03-06

The first is The Secret Power of The Word, in which the author discusses the science of sacred sound with reference to its principle of resonance (sympathetic vibration), the principles of rhythm, melody and harmony, plus qualities like pitch and timbre. The scales and the healing elements of music are investigated - the section on the musical interplay with the [[ASIN:B0006BGWQ4 Chakras]] is particularly enlightening. Other fascinating sections are The Occult Significance of Speech and Mystical Words of Power which deals with ritual words and sounds like the Hebrew God-names plus [[ASIN:0717130010 Sanskrit Mantras]] and chants.<br /><br />Part Two, the Renaissance of the Bardic Traditions, provides a history of the mystical bards and deals with magical storytelling.

As such it provides interesting theories and also some important facts, but I doubt whether the average world music fan would derive much enjoyment from it. The author includes worldwide music from the folk, art and popular traditions and mentions that it can be sacred, secular or commercial. So far, so good, but with sentences like: \\"As we encounter world music, therefore, it is important to recognize the need to reckon with different epistemologies and ontologies if we are to understand what world music can mean in its virtually infinite varieties,\\" I nearly fell of my chair laughing. In its defence, the book does include informative albeit short pieces on the 1932 Cairo Congress of Arab Music, the great Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum, Rai music, Leadbelly, Celtic music, the Eurovision Song Contest, Bob Marley, Manu Dibango from Cameroon and the musics of the various diasporas. Two maps are included: The Celtic Fringe in Europe and the Polka Belt in the USA plus there are illustrations, a bibliography, discography and an index. I picked up the book without properly checking the contents - it's great source material if you want to write a dissertation on music from different traditions, but not a text that reflects the rhythms of the rich variety of world music that is becoming more and more available to everybody in our current era of globalisation.	2003-03-03

The traditional bestiary was an illustrated encyclopaedia of natural history compiled by scribes, about the magical and monstrous beings inhabiting the medieval mind. This exquisite work encompasses not only the beasts and monsters of The Lord Of The Rings, The Hobbit and The Silmarillion, but also the plants, the nations, races and deities, vividly illuminating all the creations of Tolkien's remarkable world. The book starts with a map of Middle Earth and the Undying Lands surrounded by the encircling sea and also showing the island of Numenor in the great sea. Then follows a double-page chart of the chronology of Arda, demonstrating the order of events through the ages, from the creation to the fourth age. The next spread is a chronology of the kingdoms of Middle-Earth in the ages of the sun from the first age to the War of the Rings. The encyclopaeda proper starts with \\"Ainur\\" and takes the reader on a dazzling journey, beautifully illustrated in colour and black and white, to the last entry which is \\"Yrch.\\" This is followed by a genealogy of the races of Elves, a genealogy of the races of Men, an index of principal sources, and the concluding with a general index. The black and white illustrations are of creatures, races and flora while those in colour follow a chronological sequence from the creation to the end of the War of the Ring and depict broad landscapes, major battles and events like the destruction of Mordor and the departure of the Ringbearers. Amongst these, my favurites include The Vision and Creation of Arda, Trees Of The Valar, The Shire, Death Of Smaug The Golden, Lothlorien And Cerin Amroth, Fall Of Isengard, Wounding Of Shelob The Great and The Golden Hall Of The Rohirrim. In line with the literary form of the bestiary, the text has an archaic flavor that mirrors the writing in Tolkien's own work. Unlike in for example Robert Fosters \\"Complete Guide To Middle-Earth,\\" there aren't minutely detailed entries, in other words you will find Shelob under \\"Spiders\\" not under an own entry, but the general index at the end makes up for that. There are however, different entries for Grey Elves, Green Elves, Fair Elves and Sea Elves, as well as a long main entry under \\"Elves.\\" My favorite black and white illustrations are found under the entry \\"Maiar\\" which discusses, amongst others, Melian, the River-Woman of the Withywindle and Goldberry, wife of Tom Bombadil. David Day has succeeded in providing both a practical reference to Tolkien's work and in paying homage to the imagination of the greatest storyteller of the 20th century.

As such it is an indispensable concordance for the serious fan of Tolkien's world. The history of Middle Earth and Aman was woven together with great attention to detail so that all the stories fit together in perfect cohesion. The main body of the work has alphabetical entries from \\"Abyss\\" to \\"Zirak-Zigil\\", while Appendix A is a chronology of the First Age from the creation of E&auml; to the birth of Elrond and Elros, and Appendix B contains genealogical tables like that of the first house of the Edain, the lines of Isildur and Anarion, the descent of the Peredhil, the house of Hurin and the Rohirrim. Many of the Elvish entries have translations of their meaning, e.g. Aragorn = \\"Royal Tree\\". The treatment of languages, like variations and different shades of meaning, is quite detailed and interesting. Important races, places and characters have extensive commentary devoted to them but there are also many single line entries. This comprehensive reference work makes one appreciate Tolkien's achievement all the more. I recommend it to all who are seriously interested in his brilliant creation that has come to life again at the beginning of our third millennium with the release of the excellent Lord Of The Rings movie trilogy.

It is a well-written consumer guide to bio-oxidative therapies that highlights the therapeutic benefits of hydrogen peroxide and ozone and the methods in which they are used. The good news is that these therapies promise to bring relief to millions because the substances are inexpensive and affordable. What's more, they have very few adverse effects when correctly administered. The difference between oxidation (free radical activity) and oxygenation (increase in oxygen molecules) is made clear at the start. The clinical use of ozone and hydrogen peroxide has been amply documented in medical literature, yet ignored by the medical mainstream. At last its value is being discovered by a growing number of health-wise consumers. These two substances hold great promise for the treatment of some of the major diseases confronting humanity and they form part of a new healing paradigm involving safe, effective, inexpensive and natural forms of therapy. In the first part the author explains what these therapies are and takes a closer look at first ozone and then hydrogen peroxide. Part Two discusses bio-oxidative therapies in cardiovascular and other diseases and conditions (from Allergies to Wound Healing) as well as cancer and HIV/AIDS. A holistic protocol is provided in Part Three, which includes body cleansing, an oxygenation diet, nutritional supplements & healing herbs, aerobic exercise & breathing, emotions, mind & spirit, plus a discussion of oxygen products, services and applications. Ozone generators, air purifiers, ozonated drinking water, oxygenated bottled waters, oxygenation products and the use of hydrogen peroxide in the kitchen and garden are detailed here. The Resources section includes Internet addresses, organizations in North America and Europe, publications, manufacturers and distributors of products, videos and books. The bibliography covers books on bio-oxidative therapies, on natural and complementary therapies, plus general books on holistic health. There are also extensive Notes to the chapters and an index. Tables and figures, including a model of how a virus is inactivated by ozone and a photograph of a portable ozone generator, illustrate the text. The chapter on herbs and supplements includes interesting information on inter alia Beta Carotene, the vitamins, Coenzyme Q10, trace elements, minerals, Echinacea, garlic, Gingko Biloba and green tea. Under Mind-Body Healing the author discusses psycho-neuro-immunology, how to nurture the emotions, mind and spirit and the use of creative visualization. This excellent book certainly makes a point: that the proven safety, effectiveness and medical applications of hp and oxygen warrant far more attention than they have been receiving from the press and the medical and scientific communities. Fortunately these therapies are in use in clinics and hospitals in certain countries like Germany and this knowledge is spreading. In an age of increasing medical costs and complex medical procedures, many health-care consumers are looking for safe and effective therapies that will naturally enhance their innate healing powers. The author has done an excellent job of stimulating discussion by presenting the facts of these therapies, thereby giving consumers the necessary information to make informed and intelligent decisions regarding health-care options. I strongly recommend this book to all who have decided to take responsibility for their own health.deos and books.

The reign of Akhnaton is considered one of the most interesting periods in the history of ancient Egypt and has inspired many books, but this work by Velikovsky still remains the most fascinating. As far as we know, the religious reform of Akhnaton was abolished, his line died out and his city was abandoned. Velikovsky attempts to elucidate the end of this king, the fate of his two young successors Smenkhare and Tutankhamen, the decline of the kingdom and the fate of Thebes, at the hand of the legends that came down to us from the Greeks. Although his work is controversial, in this book he makes a very strong case for the origin of the Oedipus myth being the true history of Akhnaton and his family. The mysterious relationships, the enigmatic sequence of events and the strange finds in the graves are no longer secret and obscure when illuminated by the legend. The known history in fact ties in perfectly with the details of the legend. Furthermore, the Oedipus legend does not fall into the category of myths that reflect events in nature, because its human character is too obvious. Whatever you think of Velikovsky's alternative history, this book is beautifully written, highly engaging and never less than fascinating in its scope and detail. He even identifies Antigone as Meritaten, the half-sister and wife of Smenkhare, partly based on a beautiful poem inscribed in gold foil that was found under the feet of a mummy in an undisturbed tomb. This moving prayer or word of parting ends with the lines: \\"Give me thy hands that hold thy soul/I shall embrace and live by it/Call me by name again, again, forever/And never will it sound without response.\\" The text is illumined with 40 black &amp; white plates, including limestone heads of Nefertete and Meritaten, gold coffins and masks of Tutankhamen, the sphinx and the Memmon colossi. \\"Oedipus and Akhnaton\\" is a must for those interested in ancient Egypt, in alternative history or in the origin of ancient myths and legends.ld coffins and masks of Tutankhamen, the sphinx and the Memmon colossi. \\"Oedipus and Akhnaton\\" is a must for those interested in ancient Egypt, in alternative history or in the origin of ancient myths and legends.	2003-02-24

The work of Fritjof Capra, Gary Zukav, Lawrence LeShan, Rupert Sheldrake and Carl Jung is referred to in these chapters and it makes interesting reading.<br />Part two discusses some of the more common psychic experiences and how to evoke them - through intuition, dreams, meditation and hypnosis. I found the chapters on dreams and dreaming the most interesting. When we dream, our vibrational pattern shifts and we tune to a different spectrum of reality. And if you want to become psychic in a graceful manner, you must allow it to grow out of the practice of meditation.<br />Part three probes the role of the body, mind and soul in psychic awareness. It discusses the hologram, morphogenetic fields, the conscious, subconscious, superconscious and infinite mind. It also includes a \\"second verse\\" to the children's bedtime prayer \\"Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep\\" in these words received in trance:<br />\\"I thy child forever play, about thy knees at close of day, within thy arms I now shall creep, and learn thy wisdom while I sleep.\\"<br />Part four provides some experiments for the reader that wishes to venture into this exciting realm, and discusses the ultimate purpose of psychic awareness. It includes planning, dream recording, using a pendulum, mental telepathy, open channelling and cultivating one's spirituality. The book concludes with a discussion of psychic awareness as harbinger of global changes, followed by a bibliography and index.<br />This is a highly impressive text, dealing with all the relevant aspects of the psychic realm and how to cultivate one's psychic powers. The style is engaging throughout and easy to understand. I highly recommend it as a sensible guide to those who are interested in metaphysics but confused by the large number of disciplines and books available.in metaphysics but confused by the large number of disciplines and books available.	2003-02-22

He theorizes that the people of the Upper Paleolithic harnessed altered states of consciousness to fashion their society and used imagery as a means of establishing and defining social relationships. Cro-Magnon man had a more advanced neurological system and order of consciousness than the Neanderthals, and experienced shamanic trances and vivid mental imagery. It was important for them to paint these images on cave walls that served as a membrane between the everyday world and the realm of the spirit.<br /><br />Hallucinations were instrumental in personal advancement and the development of society. He refers to the pioneering psychologist [[ASIN:1439297274 William James]] who already in 1902 pointed out the different states of consciousness and to Colin Martindale who identified the following different states: Waking, realistic fantasy, autistic fantasy, reverie, hypnagogic and dreaming. The sense of absolute unitary being (transcendence/ecstasy) is generated by a spillover between neural circuits in the brain caused by factors like meditation, rhythmic stimulus, fasting etc. The essential elements of the religious experience are thus wired into the brain.<br /><br />Two case studies are used in support of this theory: South African San rock art and North American rock art. Chapter 8 is especially fascinating since it offers possible solutions to certain puzzles of cave art, like the mixture of representational and geometric imagery. The author believes that the trail of images from the cave entrance to the dark, almost inaccessible recesses represents a connecting link beween the two elements of an \\"above/below\\" binary opposition. Physical entry into the caves reflected the entry into the mental vortex that leads to the hallucinations of the deep trance state. In other words, the trail from the conscious mind to the deep recesses of the subconscious.<br /><br />This book provides much food for thought about our earliest ancestors and about the evolution of consciousness. Graham Hancock's absorbing work [[ASIN:1932857842 Supernatural: Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind]] was written in defense of Lewis-Williams' theory. In addition I recommend William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience, R M Bucke's Cosmic Consciousness, Rupert Sheldrake's Chaos, Creativity and Cosmic Consciousness plus [[ASIN:184333447X Stone Age Soundtracks: The Acoustic Archaeology of Ancient Sites]] by Paul Devereux as companion reading to Lewis-Williams' fascinating text.

It represents a drastic enlarging of our cosmic perspectives - the cosmos is more spectacular by far than we could have imagined. He also believes that the apparent fine-tuning that our existence depends on cannot be a coincidence. What we call the universe is likely to be just one member of an ensemble, but ours may be in an unusual subset that permits complexity and consciousness to develop. Our universe could be an atom in an infinite collection, a cosmic archipelago in which impassable barriers prohibit communication between the islands. Quoting scientists like Hawking, Chandrasekar and others throughout, the author broadens our understanding of cosmology and quantum science while offering unique and interesting new perspectives on our views of consciousness and existence. Highly recommended.	2003-02-15

Book One deals with Byrne and Weymouth's early years (Byrne's first band was called Revelation) and how the band came together. They began as New Wave art rockers who understood soul music. This part also covers the scene at the famous New York clubs CBGB's and Max's Kansas City, including interactions with other famous musicians like Patti Smith and John Cale - for example an interesting account of a John Cale gig at Lower Manhattan's Ocean Club. Book Two includes the account of the recording of More Songs About Buildings And Food with Brian Eno at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas, discussions of the albums Fear Of Music and Remain In Light, a quote from the respected rock critic Lester Bangs on the song The Big Country, the involvement of Adrian Belew with the band, Twyla Tharp as choreographer, Byrne and Eno's influential album My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts, Weymouth an Frantz's solo project Tom Tom Club and much more. Book Three deals mainly with Little Creatures, True Stories and the conflict between Byrne and Weymouth that led to the demise of the band. The book concludes with a bibliography and notes, a discography, filmography and index. Black and white photographs enliven the text. Bowman's book is filled with memorable incidents, rock personalities and musical insights and reads like a novel. Highly recommended to all who enjoy the music of this unique band.	2003-02-15

The dance called the Hustle, created by the youths of East Harlem, was instrumental in spreading the new dance culture and by the mid-1970s, discos started opening in great numbers all over New York City. Van McCoy's record The Hustle was one o the fist soon to be fold by Gloria Gaynor's Never Can Say goodbye and the songs of Barry White. Donna Summer and The Village People. Chapter 2 deals with disco fashion and has a nice pic of Christina Onassis dancing away, while Chapter 3 provides interesting histories of disco stars like grace Jones, John Travolta. Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, The Bee Gees, Chic, Sister Sledge, The Village People, Cher, Linda Clifford, Sylvester, Gino Soccio and Madleen Kane. Chapter 4 describes the dancing styles and demonstrates the Cross Step, the Bus Stop and three types of Hustles with illustrated footsteps, while Chapter 5 provides a list of discos in all the major cities of the US and Canada, from Atlanta to Winnipeg, as they existed in the late 1970s. The text is enlivened by stunning black and white photographs of places like Regines, Studio 54, The Electric Circus, The Copacabana, The Funhouse, and celebrities like Margaret Trudeau, Liza Minelli, Bianca Jagger plus artists like Grace Jones, Tony Orlando, Rod Stewart and all the others mentioned above. There are also 15 brilliant colour photographs that really capture all the glitter and excitement of the disco culture. Reading this book again gave me a feeling of extreme nostalgia for those more innocent times - as a teenybopper I was fortunate to enjoy the last years of disco. For those interested in the disco phenomenon, I would also like to recommend Albert Goldman's Disco, a more substantial and detailed work that also features lovely photographs.	2003-02-09

In other words, what we do now and how we look at life now make us happy. He explains that the \\"I CAN\\" consciousness must be infused with the \\"I WILL\\" determination and developed through a plan of action, in order to reach our goals. Success is thus not a destination but a journey, from station to station. He lists the main reasons for unhappiness as a guilty conscience, self-pity, envy, selfishness, timidity, worry and the absence of a spiritual consciousness. He discusses the role of the subconscious mind and how it is activated by enthusiasm and explains how the subconscious follows the pattern established by the conscious mind. He throws light on the difference between potential and kinetic energy and the law of cause and effect and emphasizes that one must visualize in order to materialize. With deep psychological insight and in an informal, engaging style, he brings across the common sense and the ancient truths that we all carry within ourselves, for example that happiness comes from giving happiness. The last chapter contains specific formulas for specific objectives, i.e. affirmations for inter alia better health, domestic harmony, concentration, overcoming habits, public speaking, self-mastery, etc. This is one of the best motivational books I have read, positively inspiring and illuminating.	2003-02-09

This is a fascinating look at the mythical Ark of Noah the history of its reported sightings during the last century. A relatively new development was the discovery of a ship-shaped volcanic formation on Mount Judi, seventeen miles from Mount Ararat. The author makes a strong case for this location by pointing out that the Koran gives the resting place of the ark as Judi, simply meaning \\"heights,\\" and that the Bible really says the \\"mountains,\\" not mountain, of Ararat. This formation is found on the Akyayla Range and Berlitz speculates that the ship was petrified by a process of siliconization. It used to be buried but earthquakes in the area have caused it to rise and the ground around it has eroded away, leaving a more evident Ark shape. It certainly looks very interesting from the photographs. Another mystery is the occurrence of stone anchors on the Ararat plain - similar anchors are also found in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic coast of Spain, France, Ireland, and off the coast of California. Another interesting fact I learnt from this book, is that many types of animal life, species and genera, disappeared at the time that the glaciers melted and the climate changed. Some eleven to twelve thousand years ago something deadly modified all forms of animal life, causing whole species to vanish in gigantic hecatombs. These drowned animals have been found in vast numbers in high mountain caves and crevasses and in great bone yards in various parts of the world, like Wales, Devonshire, Southern England, Dakota, Nebraska and the Florida Everglades. He also discusses the frozen mammoths of Siberia. In the last chapter, The Ark and Reality, Berlitz looks at the myths of various peoples and quotes sections from the Mahabharata, where modern weaponry and bombs are mentioned. This chapter, after spelling out the problems facing the world, concludes with a plea to humanity to look after that other Ark - the earth. There are 42 black &amp; white plates, illustrations, and hand-drawn maps of Mt. Ararat and of the larger area showing the above-mentioned Ark shape. The book concludes with a bibliography and index.

First published in 1972, this book contains 117 of his poems. I always look for imagery and phrases from his lyrics, of which there are plenty here: The germ of his song I Left A Woman Waiting appears on p.5 and a line from Listening To Her Song on p.41 (Theres a lot of music/on Clinton street) connects with the lyric of Famous Blue Raincoat,  while the lines that appear on the cover of the album Songs of Love and Hate are here too: They locked up a man/Who wanted to rule the world/The fools/They locked up the wrong man. Dance on The Money is a poem about Greece and his Beat contemporaries are acknowledged in a poem about Irving Layton and Allen Ginsberg, plus there's a poem to Norma Mailer (Dear Mailer) while Suzanne of the famous lyric features in The Form of Poetry: The whole world told me/To shut up and go home/And Suzanne took me down/To her place by the river. I am not a literary critic, but Cohens poetics reminds me of that of the Beats and to a lesser extent, of that of the Confessional school like Robert Lowell and Anne Sexton. I personally enjoy his written work, but not quite as much as his music. This book however, is a must for all true fans of the man and his exquisite music.	2003-02-09

The author seeks to identify and explain a whole body of musical work that existed outside the classical tradition and the avant-garde orthodoxies that flowed from it. He thus explores the Anglo-American musical tradition loosely associated with John Cage. Since 1974 this book has been considered the classical work on the radical alternative to the mainstream avant-garde as represented by Berio, Boulez and Stockhausen. Many of the current popular composers like Glass and Reich trace their root to this experimental school. The most fascinating chapter to me is \\"Minimal Music, Determinacy And The New Tonality\\" in which the Theatre Of Eternal Music (Tony Conrad, La Monte Young, Marion Zazeela and John Cale) as well as the work of Terry Riley is discussed. Photographs, illustrations and musical notations enliven the text and the book concludes with a selected source bibliography, a discography of experimental music and a bibliography of publications since 1974. Brian Eno has contributed an interesting foreword to this edition. The text can get a bit technical for the non-musician, but it remains a detailed work on a radical musical direction that has borne great fruit in the years since it was first analysed in this thorough and scholarly work.	2003-02-08

This metropolis is the oldest continually occupied city in the Americas. Founded in the 14th century by the Aztecs, it grew to be the capital of a great empire that amazed the Spanish conquistadors who, in 1519, became the first Europeans to witness its splendour. After a savage war, the Spaniards destroyed the glittering city of the Aztecs and on its ruins built the colonial capital that has developed into the Mexico City of today. Even more than in 1979 when this book was published, Mexico City is a sophisticated, affluent and cosmopolitan city that nonetheless faces daunting problems of overpopulation and overstretched resources. In his lively and perceptive account, the author explores the contradictions and paradoxes, as well as the excitements and delights, of this exhilarating city, whose complex character springs from its inextricably mingled Indian and Spanish inheritance. The text includes separate articles on e.g. the eagle symbol and important historical events. Sund's photographs not only provide a vivid record of the city' imposing landmarks and incomparable archaeological reassures, but give intimate glimpses of the vivacity of its people in the late 1970's. A map of the country and two maps of the city are included, as well as black and white historical photographs, aerial and nocturnal views, reproductions of illustrated Aztecs manuscripts, paintings of scenes from the city and colourful modern murals. The book concludes with a bibliography and index.	2003-02-08

From the beginning humans have worn objects as protection or to bring about certain events, to obtain strength or to enhance certain mental qualities. Nelson's book presents a huge selection of ancient and modern talismans and amulets drawn from many cultures, and explains how to charge an object with psychic energy. The chapters include: Goddesses of Antiquity, Egypt, I-Ching, The Celts, Runes, The Western Zodiac, The Maya, Totem Spirits and Power Animals. The images of the totems and talismans are provided on the left-hand pages with their explanations on the right. This is a fascinating little book that provides very valuable information in an easy-to-read manner, without ever becoming too esoteric. It will also be of interest to students of esoteric and symbolist art. Black and white photographs and illustrations enliven the text.	2003-02-08

But as an early biography of the band, it's excellent. It was researched, written and compiled with the co-operation and encouragement and Lennox and Stewart. The chapters follow a chronological sequence from Annie and Dave's childhood, early years, their meeting and falling in love, their second band The Tourists, the birth of Eurythmics, its success and concludes with the film 1984. It is interesting to learn that their first band was The Catch, which recorded only one single called Black Blood, a minor hit in the Netherlands. Since I really enjoy the Byrds-like music of The Tourists, I found the chapter titled \\"The Tourists' Rise And Fall\\" very interesting and informative. The recording of the first album In The Garden was another fascinating episode. This debut album by Eurythmics failed to chart, not because it was too experimental or weird, but rather because it was \\"too painfully reflective and pessimistic\\" according to the book. Thankfully there was Jack Steven, an A&R person at RCA who believed in them and relished a challenge. Success came slowly with the first release of Love Is A Stranger, a moderate chart success. The Sweet Dreams album was greeted with critical acclaim by Sounds, NME, The Times, Rolling Stone and Melody Maker.  Everything came together with the huge success of the Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This single: the album soon reached No. 2 in the UK, made the US charts, and Love Is A Stranger was re-released, this time to huge success. The history behind the albums Touch and the 1984 Soundtrack is given in detail and Annie also discusses her androgynous image and the inevitable comparisons to Bowie and Grace Jones. The text is adorned with brilliant Black & White and Colour photographs, including stills from the famous videos for Love Is A Stranger, Sweet Dreams, Who's That Girl, Here Comes The Rain Again and Sex Crime (1984).  The book concludes with a discography of The Catch, The Tourists and Eurythmics up to the 1984 album. There's also biographical info on the author Johnny Waller and photographer Steve Rapport. This is a well-researched, well-written, beautifully illustrated work on the early history of one of the most original and important bands of the 1980's.

It investigates the nature, form and function of poetic expression and ancient literature among an impressive variety of Indio-European peoples. The author uses the traditional comparative method to identify the genetic intertextuality of particular themes and formulas common to all the daughter languages of ancient Indo-European. The work comprises seven sections and 59 chapters. The first chapters of part 1 explain the comparative method, concepts like synchrony and diachrony and pinpoints the various Indo-European cultures in terms of genre, space and time. The rest of part 1 considers the role of the spoken word in Indo-European society and its preservation across time.<br />In chapter 3: Poetics as Grammar, Watkins analyses the expression &quot;Oats, peas, beans, and barley grow,&quot; demonstrating how the word order, alliteration and assonance form a perfect ring-composition. This formulaic utterance now functions only to amuse children, but in its essential semantics, formulaics and poetics it must have been continuously recreated on the same model over six or seven thousand years. He proves that is the central &quot;merism&quot; of an ancient Indo-European harvest song or agricultural prayer, by quoting from the Hittite, Homeric Greek, the Atharvaveda and the Zend-Avesta!<br />Selected text analyses an case studies from Anatolian, Celtic, Greek, Indic and Italic are found in chapters 7 - 11 of part 2, followed by the analyses of inherited phrasal formulas, stylistic figures and hidden meaning through chapters 12 to 16.<br />The remainder of the book presents the evidence for a common Indo-European formula in the expression of the dragon - or serpent-slaying myth. Over thousands of years this formula occurs in the same linguistic form as it existed in the original mother tongue. This formula is the vehicle for the central theme of a proto-text that has endured for millennia, a precise and precious tool for typological and genetic investigation in the study of literature and literary theory. It is thus of immense value to literary historians, literary critics and philologists.<br />I found chapters 50 - 59 of particular interest, as it deals with the application of the formula to the medicine of incantation in a variety of Indo-European traditions, and includes a discussion of the poet as healer.<br />This work is an opus magnum, and it took me months to read it. Even so, I cannot claim to have grasped all the complexities of the fascinating text in which more than 30 familiar and obscure languages are quoted. I strongly recommend this masterpiece to those interested in ancient history, language and its structure, and to literary critics.<br />The book concludes with 27 pages of references, an index of names and subjects, an index of passages, and an index of words quoted from the various Indo-European languages.precious tool for typological and genetic investigation in the study of literature and literary theory.

The poem The Only Tourist In Havana Turns His Thoughts Homeward (1961) reminds me of his song \\"Stories of the Street\\" on the album Songs of Leonard Cohen that also deals with a visit to Havana. Queen Victoria And Me appears on the album Live Songs as just \\"Queen Victoria.\\" The poem It's Good To Sit With People mentions the obscure 60's singer Tim Hardin (the same guy or a relative inspired Dylan's album title John Wesley Harding). I won't try to venture into literary criticism (my frame of reference is limited to Beats like Allen Ginsburg and Confessionals like Robert Lowell, John Berryman and Anne Sexton) but I love Cohen's imagery and I enjoy most of these. The book concludes with an index of first lines. This is a must for all Cohen completists.	2003-01-24

This book is a collection of writings compiled from pamphlets and includes sermons and meditations on a wide variety of subjects. The author's brilliant insights are vividly demonstrated by his psychological interpretation of Biblical passages, for example his sensible explanation of the 91st Psalm in the chapter titled \\"The Secret Place\\", where he convincingly shows that the psalmist knew about the individual's two minds: the conscious and the subconscious. Like the other great 20th century metaphysicians such as Florence Scovel-Shinn, Joseph Murphy and Ernest Holmes, Fox had a wonderful gift for conveying ancient spiritual truth in simple language that everyone can understand. He deals with issues like reincarnation, faith, scientific prayer, cosmic law, life after death and the practice of the presence of God in a most gripping and engaging manner, showing the true meaning of biblical passages in the light of psychology. My favorite chapters include (a) The Yoga Of Love, in which he confirms that there are many paths to the great goal, but that the pathway of love is the shortest and the easiest (b) The Wonder Child, about the indwelling presence of God, and (c) The Lord's Prayer, demonstrating what a carefully constructed formula this prayer is for the development of the soul (d) The Good Shepherd, a meditation on Psalm 23. Some chapters are introduced by quotes from the Bible, the Koran and poems by Bulwer Lytton, George Meredith and Wordsworth among others. The book as a whole is deeply spiritual and highly inspiring while practical at the same time. Ideally it needs to be studied, not just read once, and will certainly contribute to making the reader's life more rewarding and fulfilling. Fox understood the wellsprings of life and how the individual can achieve a richer and happier life by choosing the right thoughts.	2003-01-14

This delightful guide with its excellent full-color and black &amp; white photographs contains all you need to know to care for your Persian/Longhair cat. It tells you about the race's background, the standards and the colors. The selection and care of a kitten are dealth with in detail, and so are diet, training, bathing and grooming. The section on health is quite extensive - all major and minor diseases and their treatment are discussed. A chapter is devoted to breeding and raising kittens and the last section deals with showing your Persian. It was interesting to learn that the Persian of today is the result of long-ago crossings of two similar breeds of long-haired cats - the Angora and the original Persian. The Angora as a breed is extinct - Longhair or Persian is the correct name. Some of the photographs are functional, demonstrating how to e.g. comb and brush your cat, handfeeding with doll's bottles or showing scratching posts, harnesses, carrying cases and administering medications. Although this is an old edition of Ramsdale's book, it is very thorough and still useful to the cat owner or prospective cat owner. The cats and kittens in the photographs are cuddly and gorgeous.	2003-01-13

The Borgias were a Spanish noble family of moderate standing who succeeded in inserting themselves into the upper strata of Renaissance society via the church. The election of one member of the family as Pope Calixtus III prepared the way for the notorious Alexander VI and for many cardinals and rulers in Naples, Italy, France and Spain. The activities of Alexander (Rodrigo Borgia), his children Cesare and Lucrezia, and the lewd legends of incest and poisoning that have surrounded them have attracted the attention of poets, playwrights, novelists and historians of all subsequent generations. Mallett succeeds in answering the questions, Who were the Borgias?, and, What were they doing in 15h century Italy that made them so hated and feared? The history is very thorough, starting with a discussion of the Renaissance Papacy, the Papal States in the 15th century, and the pontificate of Calixtus III. The election of Alexander VI up to the death of Alexander makes for the most exciting reading, while the last two chapters deal with the subsequent fortunes of the Borgia dynasty and the Borjas of Gandia. Genealogocal tables include the Borja family of Jativa, the family of Alexander VI, the family of the dukes of Gandia, plus the Colonna, Orsini and Della Rovere families. There are extensive Notes and an exhaustive bibliography plus a thorough index. Text figures include a map of the Papal States in the 15th century, woodcut views of Rome from 1480 and 1492 and a map of the Roman Campagna. The sixteen black and white plates include portraits of Calixtus III, Alexander VI, Cesare Borgia, Alfonso d'Este and photographs of Bracciano and Nepi castles, the Torre Borgia and the Sala dei Santi in the Borgia Apartments. Mallett's book is well-written and refreshingly free of sensationalism. He paints the bigger picture without getting lost in the complicated details of Italian politics in 15th century Italy and brings all the important individuals to life on these pages.

It covers no less than 108 artists and groups with a page devoted to each, containing photographs and quotes from the artists about their lives, their music and the pop world. Looking back after 20 years, it's interesting to note who made it big, who's still alive and who faded into obscurity. Of those still making music, U2, Laurie Anderson, Sting, The Cure, Madonna, Peter Gabriel and Eurythmics became most successful, while defunct bands like Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Culture Club, OMD and others also made their mark on the charts. Many of these acts became cult artists with a devoted following, like David Byrne, Tom Verlaine, Nina Hagen, Alan Vega, Howard Devoto, Richard Hell and Julian Cope, while others had already reached cult status when the book was published, like John Cale, Robert Fripp, Nico, Rick James, Bill Nelson and Jayne County. Other seminal acts include The Cramps, Klaus Nomi, Joan Jett, Dead Kennedys, Public Image Limited, The Stranglers and Iggy Pop. The startling and impressive color and black&amp;white photographs by Noble capture the essence of the artists and the style of a long-forgotten era in the history of popular culture so well. The book concludes with a discography of albums and singles plus a short history of the artists' careers up to that point in time. Future Pop gives us a rare early look at the musicians who left their stamp and style on the music and other art forms of the past 20 years. It is also a fount of information on those really obscure artists that stopped recording somewhere along the way. Noble made a great selection all those years ago.	2003-01-03

Morse refers to the work of evolutionary biologist Rupert Sheldrake and physicist Paul Davis. Browne's own style is conversational, even folksy, and quite engaging as there's lots of common sense, humor and positivity. She deals with subjects like inter alia miracles, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, coincidence, synchronicity, astral travel and the development of the individual's psychic abilities. Her take on the soul-mate myth made me laugh while her explanation of imprints, kinetic energy, hauntings, ghosts and spirits are informative and interesting, whether you agree or not. The chapter on psychic protection is valuable, while her warnings against cults should be taken seriously by everyone. Helpful meditations are provided, for example one for examining past lives. She's very honest in stating that no psychic is able to make correct predictions all the time and admitting her own failures. In this regard, her chapter of predictions for the new millennium does contain some errors, e.g. that breast cancer would be preventable and curable by the end of 1999. The book concludes with an appendix of affirmations. Although this work has inspired a fair deal of negative criticism and although there are aspects of her cosmology that I disagree with or that I consider too simplified, there's no denying that The Other Side is an enjoyable reading experience. One doesn't have to agree with everything to derive enormous insight and pleasure from this book.	2003-01-01

Each session consists of practical exercises plus inspirational messages and blank pages for making notes. The text is based on Lester Levenson's words, sometimes as replies to a series of questions, while comments and exercises have been added by Dwoskin. The technique is based on polarities, with the reader or student exploring two sides of the problem to reach a solution and to subordinate the ego to the higher mind. Not having done the exercises I cannot vouch for their efficacy, but the book has enough of value for the casual reader too and is a source of sound psychology.	2002-12-27

The author's explanation of Biblical tales and metaphors is especially valuable and insightful and her interpretations are full of common sense and practical wisdom. Her very engaging style and wonderful ability to explain age-old spiritual truth ensure a stimulating and uplifting reading experience. She deals with topics like faith, intuition, inspiration and more, even referring to movies like The Wizard of Oz. The last chapter is about the inner meaning of the fable of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and how it relates to the thought-forms in the subconscious mind of the individual. It's brilliant! Not only are her words powerful and inspiring, but special affirmations are provided to help achieve successful outcomes. The Secret Door is definitely on a par with her classic work The Game Of Life and I strongly recommend it.	2002-12-27

Burroughs	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Three and a half stars, really	These last words of Burroughs will have great poignancy for his fans, but might not be all that meaningful to the casual reader. He writes about mundane everyday occurrences, memories of his eventful life, makes extensive literary references and provides loving descriptions of his cats. For me, the Burroughs magic is here in abundance and this book helps to complete the big picture of his life and work. It's not all smooth sailing, though, as his repetitive railings against the \\"war on drugs\\" can become a bit tedious. Obscure references are explained in the explanatory Notes: I was interested to see he was a member of IOT (International Order of Thanateros - see the books Liber Kaos and Liber Null & Psychonaut by Peter Carroll) and friends with V. Vale (See Re/Search Publications like Industrial Culture Handbook and Incredibly Strange Music). Some sections are funny, some are sad (especially where he writes about Joan Vollmer and his family) and some very interesting from a literary perspective. There are powerful passages of great beauty that stick in the mind. His love for his cats and for other animals like lemurs is very moving and shows that he may have been larger than life, but in the end he was very human. So, to wrap it up: Last Words is essential reading for the Burroughs enthusiast and the Burroughs scholar, to finally understand the man and his writing. Phew ... I am relieved, to know how much he loved some people and his pets, in the end.	2002-12-23

Perhaps our ancestors stumbled upon the fossilised bones of large dinosaurs and that's how it all began. This wonderful book by illustrator Bob Eggleton and author John Grant explores the myth in a Tolkienesque style and is very engaging for that. The illustrations are original and impressive while the text reveals old and new slants on the dragon myth in an old worldly language, not unlike that of The Lord of the Rings or The Silmarillion. Like those classics, this narrative has a psychological side giving us insight into our own thoughts and actions. Dragonhenge is a most inspiring book and would be the ideal gift for children or for adults who can still dream.	2002-12-10

It explains and discusses the origin and history of words, phrases, expressions and idioms in a most engaging manner. Every page contains something interesting or noteworthy. For example, the entry on \\"Valley Speak\\" or\\"Valspeak\\" as it is called here, refers to the language of teenagers in Silicon Valley, California that has spread around the English speaking world, and is very informative and amusing. All aspects of popular culture are covered, including music: I was delighted to discover how many popular sayings derive from song lyrics. In addition, the book is as up-to-date as can be; you'll find absolutely everything here up to the second part of 2002. I am impressed with its thoroughness and accessible style, and highly recommend it to all those who are fascinated by language and meaning in all its forms, but especially for journalists, songwriters, creative writers and cultural historians.	2002-12-10

The noisy, frivolous, gaudy people this book celebrates wanted to destroy the temples of doom - not eat babies. But this stuff was considered dangerous, subversive, contagious and, like good art, a whole lot more fun than you think you're allowed to have. Mick Wall's position as a top UK rock scribe gave him access to many of the world's best bands. As an interviewer he gets very close to the musicians and as a consequence the book is more of a dialogue between friends than a serious interview, and that's exactly where its appeal lies. A book for the hard rock fan and the late 80s nostalgist, it's still a lot of fun to read after all these years. But also check out Nick Kent's book The Dark Stuff, the chapter titled \\"The Daze of Guns'n Roses\\" gives an interesting perspective on the band.	2002-12-08

On the B-side, all you can hear is the music. Yes, the phrases do sound a bit childish, but that is exactly what the subconscious mind responds to - simple positive statements delivered in a warm and friendly voice. Since self-esteem or the lack thereof lies at the root of many psychological problems, this is a great place to start in a programme of self-improvement. Hay is an expert in the field and is blessed with a very comforting voice. Listening to this cassette does work if you are consistent about it. What is even more effective, is when you memorise some of the affirmations and repeat them to yourself, silently in your mind, throughout the day. No cutting-edge brain entrainment methods (such as metronomes) are used here, but her reassuring voice makes up for that. Give it a try!	2002-12-03

He believed in the principles of spiritualism that encompassed areas that we today refer to as ESP, psychic experiences and metaphysics. It accepted the existence of a soul and eternal life, while offering an intriguing view of existence in relationship to a greater being. Life was considered a continuum, a progression into ever greater knowledge and understanding that connected the souls of all people. He published this book in 1918 as an account of his personal investigation into the world of spiritualism and it became the most influential statement of the movement. His ideas and beliefs are stated in a clear and concise manner as he examines psychic experiences, life after death, mediums, automatic writing and related phenomena. The text includes three separate pieces on specific topics: The Cheriton Dugout, Automatic Writing and The Next Phase Of Life. The introduction by George J. Lankevich provides a short biography of Conan Doyle and a discussion of his literary works, while the afterword illumines Sir Arthur's friendship with the famous magician Harry Houdini with quotes from their personal correspondence. The book contains a useful index, while many classic works on spiritualism are mentioned in the text that thus serves as a type of bibliography. This little book was a pleasure to read and I daresay Conan Doyle was far ahead of his time with his observations on traditional religion and his holistic view of spirituality.	2002-10-14

Underworld is the narrative of a journey through the Mediterranean, the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Bay of Bengal and the Pacific Ocean around Indonesia, Japan and Taiwan in which underwater structures of possible human origin are explored. The government of India has recently authenticated two of Hancock's discoveries off the coast of that country. In both cases, these structures are dated between 9000 and 11 000 years before the current era, which supports the theory of a great flood that submerged vast areas of land at that time. What I really like about Hancock is that he provides the orthodox view at the same time as his own theories. I cannot but agree with his statement, \\"There's something wrong with the underpinning of history.\\" Hancock has indicated the most likely places for pre-flood civilizations with the help of Dr. Glen Milne of Durham University who is an expert on glaciation-induced changes in the sea level, and taking into account the plethora of flood-myths found amongst all cultures on all continents. Underworld is lavishly illustrated and well served by a thorough index and extensive bibliography. This gripping text will amply reward the reader who enjoyed Hancock's earlier titles like Keepers of Genesis and Fingerprints of the Gods. Hancock deserves credit for stimulating interest in history and archaeology. He was the writer that created interest in those little doors in the light shaft of the great pyramid that was recently in the news. Let's hope something will be revealed behind the second door!

He takes us on a journey through the Mediterranean, the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Bay of Bengal and the Pacific Ocean around Indonesia, Japan and Taiwan by looking at underwater structures that might be of human origin. I'm pleased to note that the government of India has recently authenticated two of his discoveries off the coast of India. In both cases, these structures are dated between 9000 and 11 000 years before the current era, which supports the hypothesis of a great flood that submerged vast areas of up-to-then habitable land. What I really like about Hancock as author is that he also provides the orthodox view at the same time as his own theories. I cannot but agree with his statement, \\"There's something wrong with the underpinning of history.\\" Hancock has indicated the most likely places for pre-flood civilizations with the help of Dr. Glen Milne of Durham University who is an expert on glaciation-induced changes in the sea level, and taking into account the plethora of flood-myths found amongst all cultures on all continents. Underworld is lavishly illustrated and well served by a thorough index and extensive bibliography. This gripping text will amply reward the reader who enjoyed Hancock's earlier titles like Keepers of Genesis and Fingerprints of the Gods.	2002-10-08

She met him in 1965 when she was an art student and model in Paris and soon became an intimate friend and confidante. She accompanied him and his wife on trips to Barcelona, Madrid, New York and Paris and spent every summer with Dali at his home in Cadaques in Catalonia. He served as a mentor to her; travelling with him, Lear discovered the great museums of Europe, Parisian salons and restaurants, New York bohemia and his homeland, Spain. She met lots of interesting people, including Andy Warhol, while she knew people like Marianne Faithful, Mick Jagger, Brian Jones, Keith Richards, Anita Pallenberg and David Bowie from her life in London. She reveals the real nature of her relationship with Dali, describes his funny ways and the interesting characters around him with humor, and provides great insights into Dali's relationship with Gala. She is remarkably frank about her own sexual exploits and does not avoid the negative in her very honest accounts. What make the narrative very interesting are the many references to the music, films and art of the late 1960's and the entire decade of the 70's, and her and Dali's many encounters with artists. I found Dali's political incorrectness and sense of humor very charming, and received a favorable impression of him, despite his many flaws. Lear also writes in bits and pieces about her own musical career, but I wish she had elaborated. I was always mystified about why she became a huge star in Europe but never made it in her native UK, while in the US only had some success on the New York and LA disco scenes. She herself refers to her lack of success in the UK thus:<br />\\"All the major European cities wanted my show. Only the English remained immune to the effect of Amanda Lear. They preferred rock to disco, and `punk' was in full swing in England. Dali was fascinated by this new trend, which he pronounced `pounk.' He always loved anything extreme or revolutionary. Disco music left him cold. \\"<br />Well, this is not entirely correct - punk did create an uproar from around 1976 on, but disco dominated the charts in Britain from the mid to the late seventies as it did everywhere else. The book contains lovely black and white photographs of Amanda with Dali of course and also with inter alia John Lennon, Yul Brynner, Brian Eno and David Bowie. It's a surprisingly moving and insightful autiobiographical/biographical exercise and I strongly recommend it to fans and scholars of Dali, the great genius of surrealism. Fans of Amanda will love the book. For those new to Amanda Lear, I recommend the albums \\"Sweet Revenge\\" and \\"The Collection\\" as excellent introductions to her work.nced `pounk.'

The list is long and interesting, and includes inter alia the following: Antonin Artaud, Lenny Bruce, Montgomery Clift, Hart Crane, Stephen Crane, James Dean, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, Billie Holiday, Janis Joplin, Jack Kerouac, Yukio Mishima, Amedeo Modigliani, Marilyn Monroe, Vaslav Nijinsky, Sylvia Plath, Edgar Allan Poe, Elvis Presley, Arthur Rimbaud, Anne Sexton, Dylan Thomas and Vincent van Gogh. The epilogue is dedicated to Thomas `Tyler' Bootman, with whom the author spent 13 years and who died at age 36. Short Lives was inspired by his life and death, a story eerily similar to the lives of the famous dealth with here. Every individual's story - all of them cult heroes - is told compellingly by Matson, with a wealth of black and white photographs; each chapter concludes with a list of sources by and about them. I loved especially the poignant photographs of Billie Holiday, Anne Sexton, Elvis and Jack Kerouac. The text is enhanced by quotations from the press or from those near the artists discussed, and sometimes by their own quotes or quotes from their work. An extensive bibliography is found under the \\"Acknowledgements\\" section. This is a valuable and insightful work. I do think, however, that Matson could have made the work even more scholarly by adding a chapter discussing the general phenomenon of the artist-who-dies-young from a psychological perspective. An updated, second edition of this book would be more than welcome, and ought to include people like Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, River Phoenix and others.	2002-10-04
1391018:US	50057481	R2CC9RX147OJ0F	0140193375	251739920	Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind (Compass)	Books	4	83	86	N	N	MUCH FOOD FOR THOUGHT	This book was one of the first to consider religious illumination from a psychological perspective. It differs from William James's [[ASIN:B0013UOIMM The Varieties of Religious Experience]] in that many of Bucke's opinions (e.g. his views on socialism) have been refuted by history. In order to judge it objectively, one ought thus to always keep in mind the era in which it was written. The basic point is that the human race is slowly and sporadically - albeit with increasing speed - advancing in consciousness to a higher state that will eventually lift the species above the fear, ignorance and brutality that have plagued mankind throughout history. Bucke's argument - which may be strongly disputed today - is based on analogy. He points out the three phases of consciousness found among living creatures: perception amongst lower animals, receptual consciousness amongst higher animals and the conceptual thinking of human beings which is accompanied by a strong sense of self.<br /><br />In a very interesting chapter he demonstrates the development of consciousness over the last couple of millennia with reference to mankind's improving ability to distinguish colors. Initially only black and red were differentiated, but what was perceived as \\"red\\" has been refined into red, orange, yellow and white and even further. Likewise with \\"black\\" which split up into black and blue-green, from which the separate colors blue and green were again discerned:<br />\\"The blazing blue of the oriental sky is not mentioned in Homer or the Bible, nor the Rig Veda or Zend Avesta. But in this present century we know not only the seven primitive colors, but literally thousands of different shades and gradations of them.\\"<br /><br />Bucke argues that new or enhanced senses originate with sporadic manifestations among a minority of human beings and that a new consciousness eventually spreads through the whole population. The new or fourth level of consciousness will enable mankind to perceive the unity of the cosmos and the divine presence inherent in it, liberate humanity from fear and enable the race to perceive that love is the rule and the basis of the universe: this is cosmic consciousness. Bucke predicts that it will ultimately be the norm.<br /><br />No reader will agree with all the author's points, but some of his great contemporaries like the scientist and philosopher Ouspensky agreed to such an extent that he devoted an entire chapter in his work [[ASIN:1437515606 Tertium Organum]] to this book. The response of psychologist William James in a letter to Bucke was: \\"My total reaction on your book, my dear Sir, is that it is an addition to psychology of first rate importance, and that you are a benefactor to us all.\\"<br /><br />Bucke considers the greatest teachers, artists and religious thinkers by looking at their teaching and what is known about their lives, pointing out the remarkable correspondences. Some of those discussed in detail include Gautama, [[ASIN:014100360X Jesus]], Paul, Plotinus, Mohammed, Dante, St. John of the Cross, Francis Bacon, Jacob Behmen, William Blake, Walt Whitman, Lao Tse, Socrates, Benedict Spinoza, Swedenborg, Emerson, Thoreau and Ramakrishna Paramahansa.<br /><br />His arguments are persuasive as regards both the comparison of texts and the similarities in the numinous experiences of the individuals. As such, the book also serves as an illuminating study of the nature of the mystical experience that is exactly the same in all the religious traditions.<br /><br />Bucke concludes that these individuals were the pioneers who had already entered cosmic consciousness and wished to convey its essence to the rest of humanity. They were, however, restricted to use the language of normal consciousness and that is why their revelations appear to be incomplete and even deceptive:<br /><br />\\"It would be beyond the power of the self conscious mind to conceive the cosmic conscious world. This being so, the reports made by these spiritual travelers have been not only not understood but misunderstood in an infinite variety of senses, and the essentially similar account given by for example, Paul, Mohammed, Dante, Jesus, Gautama and others, has been looked upon as a variety of accounts, not of the same, but of diverse things. A critical study of all these (seeming) diverse accounts will show that they are more or less unsuccessful attempts to describe the same thing. But because it was out of the power of the original reporter, the seer, to give anything like a full and clear account of what he saw, largely because of the inadequacy of the language belonging to the self conscious mind; because his reporters again (as in the cases of Jesus and Gautama, who did not write), possessing only self consciousness, blurred still further the picture; because translators, possessing only self consciousness and understanding only imperfectly what the teacher wished to convey, still further distorted the record. For all these reasons the important fact of the unity of the teachings of these men has been very generally overlooked; hence the confusion and the so-called mystery; a misunderstanding unavoidable, no doubt, under the circumstances, but which will one day, assuredly, be cleared up.\\"<br /><br />Cosmic Consciousness deserves its \\"classic\\" status and may be appreciated even more when read together with William James' aforementioned work. Other works on religion & spirituality that I have found inspiring or thought-provoking include [[ASIN:1602069956 Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning]] & [[ASIN:1604244267 The Creative Process in the Individual]] by Thomas Troward, [[ASIN:0823216462 Religion in the Making]] by Alfred North Whitehead, [[ASIN:0062508970 Alter Your Life]] by Emmet Fox, [[ASIN:068815994X Cracking the Bible Code]] by Jeffrey Satinover, [[ASIN:0465082726 The Thirteen Petalled Rose]] by Adin Steinsaltz and [[ASIN:1557788367 One Cosmos Under God]] by Robert Godwin.misunderstood in an infinite variety of senses, and the essentially similar account given by for example, Paul, Mohammed, Dante, Jesus, Gautama and others, has been looked upon as a variety of accounts, not of the same, but of diverse things.

The authors, all three of whom stood at the cutting edge of their respective disciplines, challenge the reader about our current views of reality, morality and the nature of life. The sometimes breathtaking insights emerging from this will not fail to move the reader. The chapters on creativity, the imagination and chaos are amongst the most compelling, and deal with theories like the cosmic imagination as a higher dimensional magnet that pulls the evolutionary process to itself, the Omega Point, and imagination arising out of the womb of chaos.  Other fascinating topics include indeterminism in nature, nature's organising fields as mathematical representations, and the encoding of information in crystals and in written language.  The chapter \\"Light and Vision\\" is one of the most poetic, dealing as it does with physical light and the light of consciousness, the theory that one's thoughts are a measurable field emanating from the eyes, the similarities between electromagnetic and mental fields, the concept of a world soul, and morphogenetic fields as a medium of divine omniscience.  Incorporeal intelligence and non-human entities are discussed - are the latter merely inhabitants of the psyche or do they have an independent existence? Scientists and inventors like Kekule, who received answers in dreams, are referenced here. The book concludes with a glossary, bibliography and biographical information about the authors. It is a stimulating text in which the power of the mythical imagination, scientific observation and innovative speculation combine to create a thought-provoking reading experience.	2002-10-01

It provides a practical guide to the care of one's pet while making entertaining excursions into the lives of famous cats of fact and fiction by using quotes from prose and poetry and showing cats in works of art. The book in fact opens with the poem My Cat Jeoffry by Christopher Smart and includes quotes from Chaucer and John Skelton. Cats feature in the works of famous artist like Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt, D&uuml;rer, Tintoretto, Ghirlandaio, Hieronymus Bosch, Brueghel and many others. In a way, the text serves also as a bibliography of works dedicated to cats, or in which they are mentioned, by people like Mark Twain, Doris Lessing, Tenessee Williams, Truman Capote and many others.  There is even a chapter on Cats in the East. The character of the cat is described and compared with other animals, and its early history traced from the first appearance of the species, through the ancient Egyptian reverence for sacred cats to its association with magic and witchcraft in the middle ages. The enthusiasm and love of cats expressed by great figures in history make delightful reading. The different breeds that now exist are considered in turn and rare types like the Tibetan, Paraguyan, Kimona, Malay, Oriental, Bobtail and Korat are described. The author also provides practical advice on choosing the right cat and caring for it from kittenhood through all the phases of its life. With more than 200 pictures in black &amp; white (including pics of Henri Matisse, Robert Graves &amp; Ernest Hemingway with their cats) - plus over 40 more in full color - an intoxicating gallery of cats and kittens is provided. This is a classic book and a must-have for all people who are owned by or love cats.	2002-09-25

An ambitious attempt to link a variety of 1980s underground performers on both sides of the Atlantic, Tape Delay has succeeded remarkably well in capturing the essence of a highly influential scene that thrived outside of the commercial mainstream.<br /><br />The book provides a snapshot of an era by highlighting the most prominent confrontational and/or controversial artists of the eighties. These include many of the New York No Wave characters and bands like [[ASIN:B000T988EM Michael Gira]], Lydia Lunch, [[ASIN:B001EJI7GU Clint Ruin]], Sonic Youth and Swans, and their equivalents in the UK & Europe such as Psychic TV, Cabaret Voltaire, Chris & Cosey, Marc Almond, The Fall, [[ASIN:B000HKDBAY Mark Stewart]], Einst&uuml;rzende Neubauten and Laibach, most of whom had emerged in the 1970s. Other prominent figures include Diamanda Galas, Coil, Henry Rollins, [[ASIN:B000002NE4 Nick Cave]], The Hafler Trio, New Order and Stevo.<br /><br />A number of these musicians were considered \\"industrial\\" and Cabaret Voltaire as well as Psychic TV, Genesis P. Orridge and Chris & Cosey (these last three under [[ASIN:B000003Z5E Throbbing Gristle]]) are also covered in Andrea Juno and V. Vale's Industrial Culture Handbook. There is a chapter on COUM Transmissions that relates to Psychic TV and Cosey Fanni Tutti of Chris & Cosey. My favorite band, [[ASIN:B00000I60J Swans]], features in a very informative interview whilst founder Michael Gira has several pieces of prose scattered throughout the book. Others like [[ASIN:B000009N93 Ms Lunch]], Cave, Mark E Smith and Stevo contribute both an interview and a page of prose/lyrics or a photo montage in the case of Richard H Kirk.<br /><br />More than 60 black and white illustrations & photographs include portraits of most of the artists and the book concludes with five beautiful esoteric montages by Genesis P. Orridge titled Thee Key, Thee Door, Thee Room, Thee Person and Thee Idea. Together with the aforementioned [[ASIN:0940642077 Industrial Culture Handbook]] and Roni Sarig's [[ASIN:0823076695 Secret History of Rock]], Tape Delay is an indispensable source for the history of the real alternative culture of the eighties.

This includes descriptions of the four Archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel, their astrological and magical significance. She makes reference to the Fatima appearance, near-death experiences and angel lore. Her discussion of angelic energy forces and the way it manifests according to group or personal factors is highly intelligent, as is her mention of Jung's view on the subject. Her conclusion: angels are true to the extent that we make them true. She asks the listener to jot down their thoughts on what they imagine their guardian angel to be like, as preparation for the meditation. On side B she presents a beautiful meditation with harp music that leads the listener deep into the psyche to discover the positive forces there that can help us in our daily lives. It starts with a relaxation process and leads into guided imagery that assists the listener in finding their personal divine symbol of security, protection and assistance. A very intelligent approach to the subject that will definitely reward the devoted listener.	2002-09-22

The founders of the Qabalah created a particularly elegant system of symbols, numbers and the figure of the Tree of Life to convey their insights.<br />The word \\"skrying\\" means \\"to see\\" or \\"observe\\" and refers to the type of clairvoyance where use is made of mirrors, crystals, water in a bowl (like Galadriël in Lord of the Rings) or the tarot, to concentrate and focus psychic abilities in order to receive and interpret visions in the normal state of waking consciousness.<br />Regardie published this work in 1932 as an easy albeit comprehensive guide to the complex system of the Qabalah and to serve as a key to its symbolism. The primary symbol of this ancient Hebrew system is the tree of life that has been used for centuries as a means to study the nature of the cosmos and the qualities of the psyche.<br />With its emphasis on direct experience by meditating on the paths of wisdom, this is a most understandable introduction to the Qabalah. The editors  have enhanced this classic work with their commentary, notes and a system of reference and have added practical material in the form of meditations, exercises, rituals and mantras.<br />Garden of Pomegranates is an excellent book for those interested in the working of the mind, in psychology, parapsychology and for practicians of the magical arts. This edition contains a glossary, bibliography and index. The text is enhanced by 52 beautiful illustrations and figures.	2002-09-03

Hopkins' riveting study gets behind the many images that have concealed the elusive David Jones of Brixton, London. Drawing on interviews with family members, ex-lovers, friends and associates, he describes Bowie early struggle and eventual breakthrough, and his development as an artist: the albums, videos, films and tours. It is illustrated with rare black & white photographs and contains a discography, filmography and videography.

True, it tends to focus on Bowie's betrayal of a variety of people who helped his career take off, but there's enough valuable information about his development as artist. Many of the colorful individuals who surrounded Bowie down the years are vividly described, as well as many interesting happenings. The black &amp; white photographs (some quite rare) are truly impressive. The index, discography and bibliography of books and articles make a valuable contribution. It takes the Bowie story up to 1986, and the gossipy writing style is entertaining enough. Not a classic work, but not bad either.	2002-09-03

This 1902 publication is justifiably considered as one of the 20th century's most influential books on psychology and spirituality.<br />James considers the feelings, actions and experiences of individuals, insofar as they understand themselves to be in a relationship with whatever they consuider the divine. It is thus about the religion of everyday life and has nothing to do with churches and dogma.<br />He writes objectively about a wide spectrum of religious experiences and quotes from the autobiographical writings of famous mystics from many traditions and of people like Whitman, Luther, Voltaire, Emerson, Tolstoy and many others.  No religions are compared, only the experiences of the individual, and his arguments are well-reasoned.<br />In his own words: \\"Both thought and feeling are determinants of conduct, and the same conduct may be determined either by feeling or thought. When we survey the whole field of religion, we find a great variety in the thoughts that have prevailed there; but the feelings on the one hand and the conduct on the other are almost always the same, for Stoic, Christian and Buddhist saints are practically indistinguishable in their lives. The theories which religion generates, being thus variable, are secondary. If you wish to grasp its essence, you must look to the feelings and the conduct as being the more constant elements.\\"<br />This book is a treasure trove of insights and collected wisdom that simultaneously serves as a trenchant plea for religious tolerance. And yes, it does sometimes read like a gripping novel, especially the chapters on the religion of healthy-mindedness, the sick soul, and mysticism.<br /><br />The reader should be patient though. Although it is not a difficult text to grasp, every sentence is loaded with so much meaning that one has to return regularly to previous paragraphs in order to fully understand and process the arguments and insights. A thorough, patient study of the text will richly reward the reader.<br />An even more rewarding experience can be had by studying Richard Maurice Bucke's \\"Cosmic Consciousness\\" and Stephan A.

By not growing, they are in essence the living dead.<br />Jung considered his own work a link in the golden chain from ancient gnosticism via philosophical alchemy to the modern psychology of the subconscious. Just as in those ancient texts, his work reveals a fragmented self in which the image of the divine may be found.<br />The author made his own translation of the sermons and provided a comprehensive preface, exegesis of the sermons and afterword in which he comments grippingly on Jung, gnosticism and the current era. His views on the survival of the pansophic/theosophic tradition (through the arts) are particularly enlightening.<br />Jung's central doctrine of individuation is an ancient concept of the western esoteric tradition - the tendency of the individual consciousness not to surrender its light into nothingness. Unlike many eastern spiritual systems, the Western tradition never knew the permanent dissolution of the individual consciousness in the divine.<br />Already in the first sermon this question is discussed, i.e. how to remain an individual while simultaneously achieving an optimal degree of unity with the ineffable greatness of the pleroma within us. Jung gives us an undivided model of reality in which both causal and acausal connections, spirit and matter, are reconciled.<br />As for belief, Jung convincingly argues that human beings have a religious need - not a need for belief, however, but one for religious experience. This is a psychical experience that leads to the integration of the soul. Inner wholeness - gnosis - is achieved not by belief in ideas, but by experience.<br />In the place of a god to believe in, Jung thus offers us an existential truth that we can experience. He rejects the \\"god of belief\\" in favor of a symbol of lasting validity, and instead of the much abused concept of \\"belief\\", he offers the power of the imagination as the way to gnosis, just as in the magickal and alchemical traditions.<br />The seven sermons are gripping and poetic, while the commentary is full of insight and enriched by quotes from inter alia the Nag Hammadi texts, Plotinus, Helena Blavatsky, Emerson and others. The most beautiful is a moving poem by the mystic Angelus Silesius, of which I quote a part:<br />\\"God is such as he is,<br />I am what I must be;<br />If you know one, in truth<br />You know both him and me.<br />I am the vine, which he<br />Doth plant and cherish most;<br />The fruit which grows from me<br />Is God, the holy ghost.\\"<br />This text, and Basilides' thoughts on the pleroma (fullness of god), reminded me of Patti Smith's song \\"Hymn\\" on her album Wave:<br />\\"When I am troubled in the night<br />He comes to comfort me<br />He wills me through the darkness<br />And the empty child is free<br />To take his hand, his sacred heart<br />The heart that breaks the dawn, amen.<br />And when I think I've had my fill<br />He fills me up again.\\"<br />I highly recommend this book as a bridge between psychology and religion, or rather the religious experience in the human psyche. It ought to be read together with William James' \\"The Varieties of Religious experience\\" and Richard Maurice Bucke's \\"Cosmic Consciousness\\", for a breathtaking metaphysical and metatextual experience.is a psychical experience that leads to the integration of the soul.

They also prove very conclusively that spirituality and abundance are not mutually exclusive, and that money is a form of energy that can be invoked, directed and amplified. The technique that they teach here is built around the sign of increase. Further magical techniques and exercises include the rituals of the black mirror, getting help from your subconscious, reading your dreams and the fivefold Prana sequence for increasing psychic energy. The style is simple and engaging, making for reading enjoyment and stimulating the reader to go through with the interesting exercises. This is an excellent manual on achieving personal prosperity, probably one of the best. The book includes an illustration of the Sign of Increase, a catalog of dream symbols and an index to the practices of creative money-making. It will amply reward the reader if you put the exercises and techniques into practice.	2002-08-11

The authors were internationally recognized authorities on the Western Mysteries and of the Ogdoadic Tradition, a hermetic school of which the keywords are knowledge and regeneration. This excellent work deals with all the important aspects of visualization: realizing that the source of supply is spiritual, the power of music and song, establishing a desire on the astral, mental and spiritual planes. The authors have a knack for explaining things simply and practically. They show you how to create and maintain an image, and how to infuse it with the power of your higher self, and even tell you how to terminate a process of visualization should you no longer want it to proceed. More advanced techniques include the Star Technique, the Multiplication Technique and the Master Method, all of them very easy to carry out. The appendices include wisdom texts to assist learning and motivation, information on prayer and worship (like building an altar), and advice on maintain sound mental and physical health. There are illustrations explaining the stairway to success and the star technique, plus an I Ching hexagram. This is a classic work in the field and one I would recommend first to those wishing to explore creative visualization.	2002-08-11

It explains the fight or flight response, the effect thoughts have on the body, and the question of death. It also deals with mourning, how to focus on the positive and has a useful section on depression. Suitable quotes by inter alia Freud, Santayana, Voltaire, Emerson, Russell, Shaw, Anais Nin, Epicurus, Whitman, Keller, Hippocrates, Oscar Wilde and Maria Montessori enhance the text and help to explain things. I would not say that it is absolutely the best self-help book I've ever read ( a little more emphasis on how to influence the subconscious mind would have been valuable), but it casts welcome new light on this thing called \\"common sense.\\" It is a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it.	2002-08-11

The discipline brings to light a vanished aspect of the past with the aid of computer modeling and sophisticated equipment to calculate frequencies and resonances. These investigations indicate that stone chambers, temples, dolmens, menhirs and even Paleolithic caves were deliberately constructed or used in ways that would enhance the ritual sounds produced within them. There is evidence that hallucinogenic substances and music were used together. Devereaux speculates about the origins of music and a lost world where echoes were regarded as the voices of the spirits. This knowledge assists in our understanding of the biochemical and physiological reasons that lie behind the reasons why dance, rhythm and percussion are such powerful human experiences.<br /><br />In his book [[ASIN:0500600392 The Mind in the Cave: Consciousness and the Origins of Art]], David Lewis-Williams theorizes that the people of the Upper Paleolithic harnessed altered states of consciousness to fashion their society and used imagery as a means of establishing and defining social relationships. Cro-Magnon man had a more advanced neurological system and order of consciousness than the Neanderthals, and experienced shamanic trances and vivid mental imagery. It was important for them to paint images on cave walls which served as a membrane between the everyday world and the realm of the spirit. Graham Hancock supports Lewis-Williams' theory and personally used mind-altering substances to prove it in a series of experiments which he so lucidly describes in his absorbing book [[ASIN:0099474158 Supernatural]].<br /><br />Part 1 overviews the mysticism, history & anthropology of sound in order to imagine how our ancestors experienced it. It deals with matters like the magic of sound, acoustical effects on the mind & body, oracle sites, spirits and sound with reference to the Greek goddess Echo, sound in initiatory, spiritual and ceremonial rituals, [[ASIN:0875420184 words of power]], whistling, brain rhythms, vibrational frequencies for various parts of the body, poetry, song, Gothic cathedrals and altered states of consciousness. The plates in this part includes full-color images of the Colossi of Memnon, rock carvings , shamans, Greek temples, Neolithic tombs, dolmens, and Newgrange site in Ireland. Particularly interesting sections include the one on Infrasound (below 20Hz, the hearing ability of the human ear, but one can feel it), on brainwave states, the resonation of body parts, and music and mysticism. Locations tested and reported on include Stonehenge and other spots on the British Isles, French and Spanish Paleolithic caves, Grecian and Mayan temples.<br /><br />The second part focuses on acoustical probing and research in megalithic tombs, the methods employed and the instruments used. It contains information on frequencies, extensive discoveries at Newgrange, the design of oracle chambers and the Hemholz Resonance. The results of research on Orkney Island and Stonehenge are provided. In the Paleolithic caves of France, it emerged that rock paintings are situated in key resonant locations; the same is true even in open-air rock shelters. Color plates include photos of sites in Orkney, Australia, Brittany in France, and Spain and Mexico. [[ASIN:0810919893 The Cave of Altamira]] by Antonio Beltran is a most impressive showcase of these prehistoric painted caves. Amongst the musical instruments discovered in Paleolithic caves are bone flutes, whistles and drums. Richard Rudgley explores objects possibly used for creating sound that date back to 50 000 BP in chapter 15 of his book [[ASIN:0099223724 The Lost Civilisations of the Stone Age]]. Finally, Devereux examines sites of interest in California and Bolivia.<br /><br />The text is enhanced by black & white illustrations, musical notations, the aforementioned striking color plates and separate blocks of copy dealing with particular aspects of the research. There are also bibliographic references & notes and an index. Being a pioneering work in this exciting new discipline, Stone Age Soundtracks is a very valuable resource and I highly recommend it to those who are interested in mankind's unknown past, and to musicologists, ethnologists and archaeologists.h particular aspects of the research.

She is one of the few female medieval composers whose work is generally known and performed today. My favorite interpretation of her music can be found in four tracks on Meredith Monk's album \\"Monk and the Abbess\\" Atherton's book provides selected texts from her visionary Scivias trilogy, her medical writings, songs and letters. Interestingly enough, Hildegard is known today in Europe by followers of holistic and herbal medicine on the one hand, and by lovers of classical and medieval music on the other. She is also admired for her life story and for having been a popular and influential author during a misogynist era. Although she was orthodox in belief and criticized the Gnostic Cathars to my dismay I still admire her spirituality and the feminine expression of it (she saw man & woman as equals) and her understanding of humanity's unity with nature and the universe. Atherton provides explanatory introductions to her writings, and the book has a chronology of her colorful life, a discography of her music, notes, and a glossary.	2002-07-30

There is an audible voice with echo effect and music over the soundtrack of inaudible subliminals. What's so great about this one is that it covers most important areas of your life with affirmations like \\"I am pwerful/energetic/creative/honest/truthful/forgiven/stress free/healthier\\" etc. whilst the audible voice is warm, reassuring and authoritative, even poetic at times.

A voluminous work, it includes everybody from Chaucer to Russell Edson. Aldous Huxley observed that parodies and caricatures are the most penetrating of criticisms. Among those that try their own gifted hands at their famous predecessors' work are John Keats (Edmund Spenser), Lewis Carroll (Wordsworth, Longfellow and Tennyson), Cyril Connolly (Aldous Huxley) and John Updike (Jack Kerouac). A few of my favorites are \\"Anne Sexton's\\" From The Brothers Grimm to Sister Sexton to Mother Goose: One Transmogrification, by David Cummings, in which a spider comes to warn Miss Muffet against her un-American health food breakfast; \\"Sylvia Plath's\\" Ragout, by William Zaranka himself, and \\"Allen Ginsberg's\\" Squeal, by Louis Simpson:<br />\\"...

For Goldman, discomania was just another outburst of what he called 'the buried life' - the underground tradition of primitive tribal religious rites, the Greek dionysiac cults and bacchanals. He therefore considered disco as a manifestation of the dancing sickness or the ever-renewing quest for ecstacy and transcendence.<br /><br />The difference with the rock experience was that the dancers themselves became the stars, instead of the performers up on stage. Goldman describes the scene from the perspective of a psychologist, sociologist, musicologist, anthropologist and participant, and it is this last view which makes this book such and excellent and highly readable document of an era. He talks about the personalities, [[ASIN:B000MY3QU0 the clubs]], the producers and the music in an intelligent but engaging, almost chatty style.<br /><br />Disco genres and musicians like Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder, [[ASIN:B000006XIR Cerrone]], Alec Castandinos, Kraftwerk, Meco and others, and the [[ASIN:B001S86J30 Saturday Night Fever]] phenomenon. The black & white photographs enhance the enjoyment of reading, and the middle section holds stunning colour pics of disco fever in action, celebrities and musicians like [[ASIN:B001H1OV8S Grace Jones]]. I think Goldman has succeeded well in preserving a lively and cinematic record of a happy era. It's also interesting to discover the roots of the techno-rave movement in these pages. Of course, the abundant varieties of today's dance music have not only their roots, but their spirit as well, in good old disco.	2002-06-09

She explains why history has depicted the Borgias as fallen angels in a corrupt era, but considers the condemnation to have been too absolute and maintains that behind the gaudy horrors existed people of real talent and achievement, some of whom even possessed moderate virtues.<br />All of the Borgias were strong and colorful characters who caught the world's attention whatever they did. The crimes and sins of Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI), his children Cesare and Lucrezia, and the legends of poisoning and incest that surrounded them, are here compellingly re-examined by Johnson.<br />There are maps and genealogical tables, a select bibliography and a detailed index, and the text is enhanced by beautiful black & white and full-colour illustrations. This is a thoroughly researched and well-written book, and I highly recommend it.	2002-06-09

White Rabbit is a comprehensive anthology that permits the reader to contemplate the complete range of substances, from absinthe, eboga and ecstasy to yage and opium to moonshine, as narrated by some of the world's most imaginative writers.<br /><br />Authors and sources include William Burroughs (The Yage Letters), Nelson Algren (The Man with the Golden Arm), Florence Nightingale, Jean Cocteau (Opium), Arthur Conan Doyle, Philip K.

Their always fascinating and often eloquent narratives provide a colorful read, amply rewarding the reader with its variety of experiences. Some pieces are way too short, though, like Florence Nightingale's one little sentence, Paul Gauguin's two short paragraphs and Rimbaud's brief poem. Elizabeth Barrett Browning's little ode to opium is also quite skimpy.<br /><br />White Rabbit provides great insight as it brings together so many interesting perspectives and writing styles. As the authors put it so well: \\"Drugs are inherently subversive, sometimes dangerous, occasionally great fun. They 'clear away the past and enhance the present,' they can inspire great art and greater experience, or they can unleash the monster lurking within.\\" The book concludes with nine pages of brief biographies of the authors, providing some background to the pieces collected here.<br /><br />Similar works that might be of interest include [[ASIN:0892817836 Phantastica]] by Louis Lewin, [[ASIN:0892819863 Animals and Psychedelics]] by Giorgio Samorini, Supernatural by Graham Hancock and DMT: The Spirit Molecule by Rick Strassman.monster lurking within.\\" The book concludes with nine pages of brief biographies of the authors, providing some background to the pieces collected here.

At the age of 37 when this book was published, Lydon hadn't changed much: burping through a book-signing session, he still despised authority and laughingly concedes that Diana and Fergie had succeeded in what the Sex Pistols first undertook with their mocking version of God Save The Queen: to put a nail in the coffin of the royal family: 'Back in the 1970s we were the only ones who dared to criticize the establishment, especially the royal family. Before then it was practically unheard of.' Even music's royal family gets their share of flack.

The plaisir du texte is of course, enhanced by the wonderful interweaving web of plot and subplots, and by the colourful array of characters. This is one of those rare novels that becomes so addictive that you compulsively read on between the fits of hysterical laughter. Not one word is unnecessary, not once sentence is superfluous. It is in fact, absolutely brilliant and for someone like myself who has no intention of reading Rabelais or Cervantes, it is sufficient.

The first, Liber Kaos proper, deals with the principles of magic, aeonics and the principles of chaos. It includes Pope Pete's fascinating psychohistory model in which the shamanic, religious, rationalist and pandemonic aeons are measured against the materialistic, magical and transcendental paradigms to illustrate the historical ups and downs of the spiritual worldview. Part two: The Psychonomicon, discusses practical magic, sleight of mind, auric and different types of color magic, from octarine to purple. It also includes the Thanateros ritual, which is a celebration of Chaoist principles and a momentary invocation of the power of chaos itself. The appendices make up the third part of the book and includes Liber KKK: an extended series of magical operations; the Gnostic pentagram ritual; chaos monasticism, and; Liber Pactionis: the structure, rituals and protocols of the magical pact of the illuminates of Thanateros. The text is enhanced by diagrams and two illustrations, and there is a short bibliography which includes Stephen Hawking and Terry Pratchet. Pope Pete certainly provides a compelling read, but I'm not convinced of his premises. As another reviewer has said, chaos only occurs in a localized context. Certain patterns in the universe, like the platonic solids and sacred geometry (the golden mean) seem to indicate the prevalence of order in the larger scheme of things. Call me a heretic or Reform Chaoist if you will, but I don't believe Pope Pete is infallible!	2002-06-04

The first is again divided into Libri MMM, LUX, NOX et AOM, and in these books Pope Pete deals with gnosis, divination, evocation, enchantment, sigils and \\"random belief,\\" something that really amused me. Psychonaut is a collection of fascinating essays on, inter alia, new aeon magic, the rites of chaos, chemognosis (with a particularly interesting discussion of hallucinogens like the amanita and psylocybe mushrooms), shamanism, gnosticism, magical paradigms and magical time. My only problem is the - to say the least - disturbing illustrations by Ward. To someone with a sensitive disposition, these detract somewhat from not only the plaisir du texte, but also the jouissance of the reading experience. The text is richly enlivened by diagrams, figures, glyphs and perhaps to its detriment, by those eerie pictures. Apart from that, it's a no-nonsense magical handbook in a lucid and engaging style. A classic of sorts, I guess. Heartily recommended to fans of [[ASIN:B000V3JGIS The Addams Family]].	2002-05-28

All that remains of this antediluvian culture are the \\"fingerprints\\" Hancock identifies in various phenomena that have puzzled mankind throughout recorded history. He reveals strange echoes of a society of navigators and builders that flourished up to about 12 000 years ago, gradually building up a compelling argument for the existence of a prehistorical civilization. By examining phenomena around the world, from the Nazca drawings in Peru to the pyramids of Egypt, he interprets these \\"fingerprints\\" as ancient signs, or misunderstood teachings left by our unknown ancestors in order to communicate with modern generations. This, and Hancock's other books like [[ASIN:1400049512 Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization]]  threaten to overturn conventional explanations of our past and stretch the horizons of our future. Meticulously referenced, and often scientific and technical, \\"Fingerprints\\" is consistently captivating because Hancock embroiders the narrative with colorful analogies and travelogue, making it easier to understand his point and leaving the reader impressed by the mysterious patterns he unravels. Lavishly enhanced by photographs and illustrations, the book contains extensive references, a vast bibliography and an index.	2002-05-28

The style is refreshingly direct and lucid as it explains the ancient truths anew. Much emphasis is placed on the emotion of gratitude and the individual's creativity as the channels for creating wealth; in other words, creating abundance without competing against others. Wattles writes with genuine authority and his style is free of embellishment. This is definitely a classic of the genre and ranks with the best works of later authors in the field, like Catherine Ponder, Joseph Murphy, John Randolph Price and Stuart Wilde.	2002-05-23

Not quite all of them though; there is a definite slant towards the American scene and some lesser-known or cult stars from the UK are absent in these pages. That is because the editors had to restrict the entries to what was available in the United States at the time of US publication.<br />In addition to the alphabetical section on groups and individual artists, there are two further sections: one for Anthologies and one for Soundtracks.<br />Its interesting to compare the numbers of albums by the greatest artists: Elvis comes in at 121, followed by James Brown at 88, Frank Zappa with 51, The Beatles and Bob Dylan with 36 each, while the Rolling Stones slot in at 35 and other favorites like the BeeGees and Bowie do well with 24 and 26 respectively.<br />Flipping through the pages amply rewards the peruser, often for the unexpected little tidbits: a band called Silly Wizard, dubbed masters of classic Scottish folk and the fact that Hound Dog was first recorded by Big Mama Thornton in 1954.<br />Grunge is well represented by Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soul Asylum, while World Music is a bit neglected: King Sunny Ade and Youssou NDour are there but no Salif Keita.<br />Still, one can establish the exact difference between Lisa Stansfield and Taylor Dane, and read all about important but obscure singer/songwriters Laura Nyro and Gram Parsons.<br />In the soundtrack section, I was pleased to see Saturday Night Fever and Thank God Its Friday rated highly while Fame and Flashdance fared poorly.<br />Although I sometimes disagree with the critics assessments, they always phrase it amusingly: Meat Loaf is dismissed as schlock rock!<br />Every entry is rated with a star-system from 1 to 5 just like here on amazon, although in any piece on artists with large oeuvres (like Elvis) the emphasis is rather on a general overview rather than a detailed discussion of every album.<br />I would say this is a worthwhile reference work to have at hand, but shouldnt be considered the last word in music criticism.ith the critics assessments, they always phrase it amusingly: Meat Loaf is dismissed as schlock rock!<BR>Every entry is rated with a star-system from 1 to 5 just like here on amazon, although in any piece on artists with large oeuvres (like Elvis) the emphasis is rather on a general overview rather than a detailed discussion of every album. <BR>I would say this is a worthwhile reference work to have at hand, but shouldnt be considered the last word in music criticism.	2002-05-22

Troward had a knack for conveying profound philosophical matters in a most understandable way and for formulating ancient truths so that a child could understand. He explains the difference between form (matter) and being - that the one is the mode of the relative and the mark of subjection to conditions, while the other is the truth of the absolute and that which controls conditions. Because spirit is infinite, it is everywhere and must be present at every point in space at the same moment. This is a fundamental fact of all being. The relation between spirit and being as idea (from which the elements of time and space are absent) and form (the relative which is dependent on those elements) leads to the fact that pure spirit continually subsists in the absolute and from it all the phenomena of being flow. In proportion to our level of recognition of this fact, our power for producing visible outward results by the action of our thought will grow. The book concludes with the practical application of this knowledge in our lives and affairs. I highly recommend the Edinburgh lectures as well as the Dore Lectures and Troward's masterpiece &quot;The Creative Process in the Individual.&quot;	2002-04-21

Like the others, he writes in the Christian Gnostic tradition and illumines the scriptures in a way that has relevance and practical application for seekers after truth. Only as Being projects itself into existence are we able to know it. We may know the fact that Being &quot;is,&quot; but only as it manifests itself in form are we able to know it itself. And it is only through thought that we are able to conceive of Divine Being as the infinite spirit and essence of life and then to realise that it is the life of our life - in this way we can allow it to become incarnate in us. Rightly directed thought has redeeming power, so it is through our thought that we can create for ourselves a new heaven and a new earth. Trine explains why it is better to avoid perplexing theological theories and dogmas that merely give a vague promise of some afterlife instead of the means of actualising the divine life here and now. The one great truth of being is that there's no real life except God and to the extent that we realise the indwelling presence, we become awakened beings. But it is not the mere intellectual recognition, but the conscious vital and living realisation of this truth that makes it of value and renders it manifest in our everyday lives. This great classic is of the same quality as Trine's &quot;In Tune with the Infinite&quot; and I highly recommend it.	2002-04-21

Armstrong discusses each of the four mystics in an introduction to selections from their major works that are reproduced here:<br />(a) The eccentric Richard Rolle of Hampole and his work The Fire Of Love<br />(b) The author of The Cloud Of Unknowing followed by this deeply moving text<br />(c) The sober Walter Hilton and his Ladder Of Perfection<br />(d) Julian of Norwich and her work Revelations Of Divine Love.<br />My favorite text is The Cloud Of Unknowing which is mentioned in Leonard Cohen's song The Window on his album Recent Songs (1979). It is very accessible in its gentle humor and its emphasis on the heart-felt spiritual experience but I can also relate to the more serious work of Julian of Norwich. Richard Rolle is a bit extreme and one-dimensional for my taste, while I found Walter Hilton to be not \\"mystical\\" enough. But all of them journeyed inward to the depths of the self and each in their own way created a personal faith that offers a more intimate experience of the divine. Armstrong's insightful introduction demonstrates how the mystical experience is similar in all religions and her interpretations of these texts are guaranteed to encourage modern seekers of spirituality and transcendence in the Christian tradition. Above all, in this book Armstrong has done much to restore the greatest voices of the long-lost Western mystical tradition to their rightful place. In this 21st century, many adherents of mainstream Christianity may rediscover the mystical experience and find it to be a more meaningful form of religious practice than the conventional and dogmatic expressions of faith.	2002-04-13

The text is a mystic exploration of the divine that rejects the use of the intellect and the imagination, preferring an inner knowing, like a numinous experience based on feeling, a gnosis of the heart. An important theme is the difference between the active and the contemplative personality; others include the awareness of self, death of the ego, and advice on leading the contemplative life. Although this writing is deeply embedded in Christian tradition and I disagree with many of these beliefs, I still admire the author's gentleness and sense of humor. All spiritually-minded people will benefit from a study of this almost poetic text. The most beautiful sentiment is this: \\"For it is not what you are nor what you have been that God regards with his most merciful eyes, but what you would like to be.\\"	2002-04-12

I doubt, however, is this title is of the same quality as his classics like Affirmations and The Force. This book was published in 1993 and I suspect he might already have been proven wrong in some of his political predictions. Also, sometimes his thoughts meander and it becomes difficult to make out exactly what he wants to say. Nevertheless, there are brilliant passages and his dissident and unorthodox views of stuff like global warming are excellent. His analysis of government misrule, especially in the manipulation of money, is also very valid. His explanation of historical events based on the wave/particle duality is original and interesting. So yes, a thought-provoking book and a good read, but not his best.	2002-04-09

In almost all the fundamentals these teachings correspond with the ancient knowledge, current New Age and New Thought beliefs and with the wisdom of the East. As the author puts it so well: &quot;Shamanism has no leaders or dogmas, and shamanism has no followers, only doers.&quot; In other words, it is the responsibility of the individual to find the divine within. The style is accessible and engaging and the text is enhanced by explanatory illustrations. There are exercises, a glossary, bibliography and index.

These include healing of oneself and others, both physical and mental, solving money and relationship problems, and more. Many examples of healing are given and every chapter ends with the exercise technique to solve that particular problem. Although this book is valuable, I have not found the text to be as engaging or inspiring as, for example, the work of Catherine Ponder or Joseph Murphy. Also, not enough emphasis is put on harnessing the power of the subconscious or on how to overcome resistance from the conscious mind. Having said that, everyone who seriously and consistently practices the eternal truths explained here will find great benefit.	2002-04-08

Books	5	15	15	N	N	INSPIRATIONAL CLASSIC	The message of this book is that every individual's good is already available and that anyone ready to receive can build her/his world by means of effective prayer. The ancient principles involved are explained with clarity and understanding. Holmes discusses the operation of divine principle as a law of cause and effect and how, when you impress your thought upon it, it is its nature to take that thought and bring it into manifestation in your reality. But there's something more than the law - an intelligence to which we may go for inspiration, guidance and direction; a power responding to us and a presence existing within us. In the author's own words: \\"Our communication with God must of necessity be, and always remain, an inner light; we communicate with the indwelling God.\\" This is what the sages and mystics from all traditions have been claiming for thousands of years, and Holmes had a brilliant gift for delivering this ancient message in the 20th century. Not only that, but he has been proved correct in his prophetic vision. Remember, this book was compiled from his lectures in 1934, many decades before the stirring of what is now called \\"New Age\\" for want of a better term, and also long before the work of Carl Jung became widely disseminated. I love Ernest Holmes' engaging style and ability to explain difficult concepts in a simple way. Similar authors that I have found to be equally inspiring include Joseph Murphy, Catherine Ponder, Frederick Bailes, Ralph Waldo Trine and Thomas Troward.	2002-04-05

Factors like a healthy self-image and certain other attributes can change a negative and failure-prone personality to a positive one that admits no defeat and recognizes that good luck is not an accident. In reality, \\"good luck\\" means the attraction of favorable chances by a positive mind-set within. Personality factors that attract luck include a high energy level, generosity and a firmly held belief that one is lucky. Also, the will to attract luck, in the author's own words: \\"The extent to which we make ourselves luckier is likely to be directly proportional to the force of our will to be lucky. The will to be lucky is the crux of our internal development, the channel through which we can realize our full potentialities as lucky human beings.\\" This is a pleasant read with valuable practical advice that will benefit the reader if applied to her/his life.	2002-04-02

It is part journal, in which the young gentleman writes about his family, his friends, their cat called Drut and their dog called Albert Schweitzer, and part dictionary, in which an impressive variety of farts is listed and described, from the Alarm Fart to the Zipper Fart. In re-reading it recently, I found myself rolling on the floor every few pages. In this regard, I found the following particularly funny: (1) The Dog Fart: It is necessary for a dog to be around for this fart to occur  (2) The Interrogatory Fart: Seems to say, Oh? or, Well? It can be a very silly fart when you are alone  (3) The Scuse Me Fart: This fart excuses itself as it is farted. It is about as close to words as a fart can get. The sound it makes is like a little soft whisper that says, Scuse me. Its the most polite of all farts  As a masterpiece of scatology and coprofilia, this book is a delightful rival to certain passages in Chaucers Midsummernights Dream. I highly recommend it as a gift book.	2002-02-26

The qualities and relationship between the Conscious (Objective or Supraliminal) and [[ASIN:1401923313 Subliminal]] (Subjective or Subconscious) aspects of the mind are lucidly described. In his very readable and engaging style, the author teaches us how to use both phases of the mind synchronously, harmoniously and peacefully in order to bring harmony, health and abundance into our lives.<br /><br />Originally published in 1957, it was way ahead of its time since the mind-body connection was only beginning to be taken seriously by mainstream medicine and large sectors of the public in the 1990s. The author's metaphysical interpretation of scripture is certainly life-affirming, wholesome and uplifting, as opposed to certain literal interpretations that induce religious morbidity and other destructive mindsets. He also explains that Biblical statements are parables, allegories, metaphors, similes and cryptic statements, and are thus not to be taken literally. The main message is that we are all children of the infinite, born to win, and to live in the joyous expectancy of the best. (See the pioneering work [[ASIN:8562022438 The Varieties Of Religious Experience: A Study In Human Nature]] by William James).<br /><br />The author explains how the mind works, how it can heal, how to pray and why [[ASIN:160459053X thought-patterns]] are creative. There are chapters on evil, how to control fear, marriage and the power of suggestion. The book contains references to [[ASIN:1420927248 Thomas Troward]] (See his masterpiece The Creative Process In The Individual which I recommend). This is an excellent guide for all holistic healers. In addition, I rate highly the author's [[ASIN:1607961423 The Power of Your Subconscious Mind]], a true classic which also deals with healing and may be read in conjunction with this book. In Murphy's own words: 'Begin to see tongues in trees, sermons in stones, songs in running brooks, and God in everything.'and may be read in conjunction with this book.

Spencer Lewis and were not originally intended for publication in this form, but rather as counsel and advice to members and students of the Rosicrucian Order, somewhat like letters from a master to his disciples. These essays are, however, of great value to all spiritually minded people as they touch upon the fundamentals of human life, such as birth, mankind's mission, our concern with the afterlife, and practical problems of morals and ethics. The author writes with authority and speaks to the reader with great clarity. Written in conversational style, the essays lack formality and are sensible and serviceable in confronting the mysteries of life. Chapters which I found particularly appealing include the following: God and the Cosmic, About Healing, Psychic Centers, Human Auras and Science, Demonstrating Psychic Power, Swedenborg and Jacob Boehme, Mystical Numbers, Do Animals Have Souls? and Transition. Highly recommended for reading pleasure and as a reference work.	2002-02-19

All relevant issues are discussed, such as the role of the mind and emotions, distant healing, the power of thought, dealing with stress, children and healing, plus animal healing. The section on the human energy field is particularly illuminating in its discussion of bio-energy, the etheric body, the aura and the charkas. Other interesting sections include training as a healer , the healing energy of plants, color and healing, the soul's journey and a spiritual view of death. A helpful list of spiritual healing organizations in the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the USA is provided with their contact details. It concludes with a bibliography, a glossary and an index.

Understanding the flow of money in our lives is one of the great spiritual lessons, as is a thorough understanding of the dynamics of love and interpersonal relationships.  Many of the great teachers of mankind have taught that abundance is spiritual - that it is one's feelings and the power of one's thought that create wealth, and Wilde casts new light on these ideas in his witty and engaging style as he discusses the ten laws of abundance. He refers to the works of other great writers like John Randolph Price, Catherine Ponder, Ernest Holmes and Deepak Chopra and has some very interesting views of how manifestation takes place by the power of thought out of the quantum possibility into our three-dimensional reality. Ultimately, it's all about energy and how to cultivate a prosperity consciousness. Wilde is a brilliant writer and this work of his is no exception. As he says: \\"There's no reason why you can't be very rich and still be an extremely spiritual and wonderfully generous person.\\" I highly recommend this excellent guide to bring those streams of plenty into your life. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.	2002-02-06

Books	4	15	20	N	N	A GOOD READ	I take cognizance of the criticism expressed by other reviewers, such as the claim that the authors have ignored the results of more recent scientific research.<br />Even so, this is a fascinating book which makes one think, in the vein of Graham Hancock's \\"Fingerprints of the Gods\\" but with greater emphasis on the natural sciences although mythology and legend are also briefly discussed.<br />It is refreshing to see scientific orthodoxy challenged, and although the authors may err in some of their assumptions, there is still enough here of value to make you think and wonder.<br />Every chapter has an extensive bibliography and the text is amply illuminated with maps, tables and figures. There are seven appendices and a detailed index.<br />What I found particularly fascinating is Map 2A: \\"A tentative reconstruction of the pre-catastrophic Pleistocene World,\\" showing much larger continents and smaller, scattered seas.<br />I highly recommend this book for its multi-disciplinary approach, its bold rejection of the ice age theory (called \\"the icy chimera\\") and the interesting alternative history it proposes. Read it to broaden your outlook on our planet's unknown recent past.	2002-02-04

Burroughs' writing here is a unique and successful blend of autobiography and detached journalism, unprecedented for that time. The prologue gives Junky an air of authenticity from the outset as the author briefly describes his childhood before plunging into this narrative of a journey - teeming with colorful low-life characters - from the Midwest to New York to Texas to New Orleans, a farm in the Rio Grande Valley, & finally Mexico in his relentless pursuit of the heroin trip.<br /><br />There is a certain aloofness in the style, giving the reader the impression that you're only witness to a restricted part of the protagonist's experiences. For example, the text makes vague references to his wife who obviously journeyed and indulged with him, but no more is told of her, poor Joan. Although [[ASIN:0140083898 Queer]], which is a more rounded novel, filled in many pieces of the jigsaw, it was only upon reading Ellis Amburn's [[ASIN:0312145314 Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac]] that this novel finally made sense and I began to see a fuller picture of Burroughs, his wife and their contemporaries.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a piece of brilliant writing on many levels.

Not only that, but it also sheds light on a whole generation of bohemians and contemporaries of Kerouac whilst providing valuable background and insight into the literary masterpieces produced by this generation that included William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Paul Bowles, Neal Cassady and many others. Their lives prove that the path of excess often leads to the most sublime literature. This book has stimulated my interest in the Beat writers all over again and I shall reread their classics once more, this time with a clearer understanding of the interpersonal relationships and mutual influences underlying the text. I believe Amburn's excellent book is indispensable for a thorough understanding of the Beats and is a brilliant reference work with its copious notes, extensive bibliography and thorough index. The text is enlivened by black and white photographs all the important people, places and documents that played a part in Kerouac's life. Impeccable scholarship and an engaging writing style combine to ensure a riveting read and a valuable reference source that I certainly will return to again and again.	2002-01-28

He deals with pagan frauds and Christian precedents, Hebrew forgeries, scripture forgeries, the Church Fathers, the Gospel forgeries, the church forgery mill and ends with the chapter: The `Triumph' of Christianity in which he takes stock of what he considers the disastrous influence of the faith on Western culture and the bad fruits of Christianity, concluding with an appeal to reason.<br /><br />This is a brilliant antidote to superstition and religious brainwashing, and an appeal to the liberating light of reason. I like Wheless' clear and amusing style; the chapter on the early Church Fathers is especially funny, as he demolishes their fatuous fable-mongering and exposes them for the simple-minded clowns they were. Not even Saint Augustine, propagator of [[ASIN:0805446273 replacement theology]], escapes his probing wit, as he mercilessly exposes the \\"great doctor's\\" foolishness. Wheless does not address the issue, but many of these Church Fathers were also hate-mongering antisemites; the best book on the subject is [[ASIN:1568215193 Christian Antisemitism: A History of Hate]] by William Nicholls.<br /><br />It's rare that such important food for thought is offered in such an engaging style. There's a guaranteed laugh on almost every page, so the book provides reading pleasure and also serves as a handy reference work. But that is not the full story. In the introduction, Wheless heaps effusive praise on the Soviet Union of his day (1930s). Well, the archives have been opened and the full extent of the slaughter is known. Please consult [[ASIN:0712697500 The Harvest of Sorrow]] and [[ASIN:0195071328 The Great Terror]] by Robert Conquest.<br /><br />One of the problems with reason as the only moral guide is that people are incapable of morally functioning on the basis of reason alone.

Just like the Dead Sea scrolls, these texts cast new light on the early years of the Christian era. Not all the books are strictly speaking Gnostic scriptures, as it even includes a part of Plato's \\"Republic.\\" None of them refers to itself as \\"gnostic\\" and not all stand in the Christian tradition. There are text with strings of vowels and magic words/mantras that will make sense to New Agers, e.g. sound healing by stimulating the charkas. The excellent introduction by James M. Robinson discusses what is known about the history of the Gnostics, the background to the documents and their theological significance. The works that I find fascinating include The Gospels of Thomas and Philip, The Thunder: Perfect Mind, The Concept Of Our Great Power, Asclepius 21 - 29, The Three Steles of Seth, The Exegesis of the Soul, Zostrianos and The Apocalypse of Peter. Although there are different approaches and contradictions, I get the following main message from the Nag Hammadi texts: every individual must find the divine in themselves, in other words, the kingdom of heaven is within. The afterword by Richard Smith: The Modern Relevance of Gnosticism, is particularly relevant and readable as it traces Gnostic ideas through Edward Gibbon, the Enlightenment writers, William Blake, W.B. Yeats, Helena Blavatsky, Carl Jung, Herman Hesse, Nicholas Roeg's film The Man Who Fell To Earth, science fiction writers like Philip K. Dick and beat writers like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. This is a brilliant piece and I am inspired by the excerpt from Jung's \\"Abraxas\\" poem to further investigate the Jung connection. Forgive me for stating the obvious, but this volume has enormous significance and will continue to increase in stature in the following decades. It is moreover not only of importance to historians and theologians but to all spiritual people who seek to broaden their knowledge.ual people who seek to broaden their knowledge.	2001-12-27

It deals with mysticism in the Non-Christian world and in the West, Non-religious mysticism, esoteric mysticism, the nature of the mystical experience and communicating it. I thoroughly enjoyed the author's discussions and was pleased to be introduced to the anonymous work \\"The Cloud Of Unknowing\\" and to the work of Lady Julian of Norwich, among others. I'm not sure whether I fully agree with his opinions on Aldous Huxley, Timothy Leary or his views on Magick and the Hermetic tradition though. This is however, a very good introduction to the subject, and a compelling read. Contains copious notes and references, a useful bibliography to reference works, the writings of the mystics, plus critical studies and histories of mysticism.	2001-12-18

I love Lester Bangs' unrestrained style: the passionate torrents of words, the extravagant metaphors and the unique insight. Above all, his contagious enthusiasm serves to drive one back to the music - to listen, enjoy and appreciate again and again.<br />Apparently this book does not contain all of his best work but I intensely enjoyed the tales of his various encounters with Lou Reed, the pieces on No Wave (Reasonable Guide To Horrible Noise), Peter Laughner, David Bowie, Kraftwerk, as well as his hilarious warnings against James Taylor and Barry White.<br />Just sometimes, he loses me when the writing becomes impenetrable and he goes off on too many tangents, as in pieces like &quot;Fragments 1976 - 1982&quot; and &quot;Ten Post-Lib Role Models for the 80s&quot; from the chapter titled Unpublishable. Where I do not agree with him, as in his (perhaps tongue-in-cheek?) endorsement of Reed's &quot;Metal Machine Music,&quot; he still makes me laugh. Bangs would also have made a great novelist as is evident from the excerpt from Maggie May (1981).<br />To understand Lester and the background to this compilation, I recommend reading Jim DeRogatis' excellent biography &quot;Let It Blurt&quot; at the same time, as it also contains an impressive bibliography of his work and articles about him.<br />I look forward to more Big Bangs - more of his remarkable writings being made available in compilations.	2001-12-17

This brilliant biography of Lester Bangs captures the essence of the man and what he was about with great clarity. DeRogatis writes with passion (I mean, he makes Lester's passionate sense of life come alive) and unlocks great swathes of rock culture and rock literature that I had not been aware of. It pleases me to know that Bangs was a kind person with integrity. The afterword covers his legacy in the work of music writers, in the lyrics of other artists, in his musical influence on certain alt-country bands, and in the book \\"Psychotic Reactions,\\" a compilation of his work by Greil Marcus. The appendices include Lester's \\"How To Be A Rock Critic\\" and some of his lyrics, and the book provides copious notes, sources and a wonderful bibliography of Bangs' articles, reviews, books, contributions to anthologies and encyclopedias, letters and recordings, plus articles about him by other authors. It is well-illustrated throughout. Let It Blurt is a classic, both as a fascinating life story and history of rock criticism, and as a valuable reference source to Bangs' work.	2001-12-17

He discusses brain function and chemistry and how it relates to nutrition, and provides information on how to improve your mind through lifestyle factors. This is followed by detailed explanations of how supplements work, supported by research findings, under the categories Memory Boosters, Mood &amp; Energy Lifters, Methyl Donors, Keeping Your Brain Young With Antioxidants, Mind Energizers, Amino Acids, Brain Hormones, and Psychoactive Herbs. There are extensive mind-boosting programmes for the age groups 25 - 40, 41 - 60 and for age 61 and over. The last chapter provides natural prescriptions for depression, vision enhancement, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. This well-researched, well-written book is rounded off with a glossary, bibliography and references plus a thorough index. It is the most complete and authoritative book of its kind and also a pleasure to read. I would have liked to find more information on Deprenyl, but it is a drug - not a natural supplement - and thus outside the scope of this book. Similar informative books that deal with nutritional supplementation include William Regelson's 'The Superhormone Promise' and Timothy J Smith's 'Renewal.' Mind Boosters however, remains the best overall reference book on cutting-edge nutrition for a healthy mind.	2001-08-13

An anti-oxidant co-enzyme, ALA has proved highly effective against liver damage, regulates blood sugar, inhibits viruses and decreases fat production.<br /><br />ALA is special due to its ready bio-availability, presence in a variety of locations (tissues, cells, membranes, etc), interaction with other anti-oxidants, chelates free metal ions and neutralizes the following free radicals: superoxide, hydroxyl, peroxyl, hypochlorous, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide & heavy metals. ALA is found in potatoes, spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, carrots, yams, sweet potatoes and red meat, particularly heart & liver.<br /><br />Sosin highlights the role of the substance in combating cancer, diabetes & heart disease, and in neuroprotection with reference to Neuropathy, [[ASIN:087319036X Alzheimer's]], Parkinson's. Other chapters deal with this role of this potent anti-oxidant in inflammatory disorders, HIV, and vision disorders like macular degeneration, cataracts and glaucoma.<br /><br />The special role of ALA in protecting internal organs and its benefits for athletes are examined whilst dosages are provided in chapter 15 which also has sections on possible side effects. I found chapter two, which is devoted to the main free radical culprits and the major protective anti-oxidants, of great interest. One can even work out your own anti-oxidant profile in a question-and-answers section.<br /><br />Appendix A reflects the supplement program at a wellness institute. There is a resource guide for buying it as a supplement, a section on questions and answers, a very extensive bibliography of mostly articles from scientific journals and a thorough index.

His DHEA Plan is not only about taking pills but also improving one's lifestyle with stress-reduction techniques, an exercise program and dietary guidelines.<br /><br />DHEA is a natural hormone produced in the adrenal glands; the full name is Dehydroepiandrosterone. The author covers all aspects of the hormone, from the Dioscorea plant in which the supplemental form is obtained, through the manufacturing process, down to dosage directions. The therapeutic potential of the substance is examined with reference to its ability to reduce stress, protect joints, build bones & lean muscle mass, counteract fatigue, beat depression and boost memory. DHEA may eventually play a greater role in the fight against cancer, diabetes, heart disease and osteoporosis.<br /><br />Cherniske's witty writing style keeps the attention throughout, and the book contains a number of appendices (resources, health support organizations, reasons why it is essential to take vitamin supplements) plus a glossary, bibliographic notes and index. Each chapter concludes with a bibliography of articles from the scientific literature and the text contains a few black & white illustrations. Oddly enough, the grandmother of all natural hormones, [[ASIN:0895298031 Pregnenolone]], is never mentioned and is not found in the index. This is strange in view of the fact that in the body DHEA derives from Pregnenolone and shares with it a number of features.<br /><br />I also recommend Ray Sahelian's books on [[ASIN:0895297744 DHEA]], Pregnenolone & Melatonin, [[ASIN:0671010034 The Superhormone Promise]] by William Regelson and the work of [[ASIN:1591200695 Ronald Klatz]] as valuable sources of information on all the superhormones & other supplements that can extend and improve human life; besides natural hormones these include amino acids, vitamins, minerals, trace elements & phytochemicals as well as medicines like Cimetidine & [[ASIN:087319036X Deprenyl]].ts & phytochemicals as well as medicines like Cimetidine & [[ASIN:087319036X Deprenyl]].	2001-07-23

Although [[ASIN:0142003166 Junky: The Definitive Text of Junk (50th Anniversary Edition)]] is great, Queer reveals a more human side to his work where one can actually empathize with the main character. His descriptions of Mexico City in the late 1940s and his circle of friends, many of whom were fellow American expatriates, lend a special air of magic to the writing. The flashes of humour are always unique and refreshing, eg. the amusing story of his fantasy trip to the \\"Upper Ubangi.\\" A brilliant work whose many charms I intend to delve into again and again.	2001-06-04

All the well-known laws of prosperity are covered in the author's engaging style, followed by the familiar testimonies of various people's experiences. Useful affirmations and information on visualisation are provided in Murphy's inimitable style. I admire the simplicity of his writing and his talent for clearly explaining the laws of mind. His non-dogmatic view of &quot;tithing,&quot; which he explains as giving with love, is not about only money and especially not about percentages, but about cultivating the right spirit of giving in all areas of your life. There are numerous quotes from people like Emerson, Gibran, Longfellow and from the Bible. Fortunately, Murphy's interpretation of these biblical statements make sense in the light of psychology. A highly recommended work of wisdom and good guidance.	2001-06-04

I have exactly the same feelings as the earlier reviewer: this one is no different from most of the other books covering the same subject. I agree that there are too many personal testimonies and not enough &quot;meat,&quot; but even so, this is certainly not a bad self-help book. My favourites of the genre are by Joseph Murphy and Catherine Ponder, and although these also include lots of testimonies, there is something special in theit writing style. Norvell also emphasizes the 2 main techniques of conditioning yourself for success, by (1) affirmations (2) meditation. Other authors to be investigated include Stuart wilde, John Randolp Price and Florence Scovel-Shinn. But this one is OK, especially at the reasonable price.	2001-06-01

It is also interesting to compare this book with the books of Velikovsky (Ages in Chaos, Worlds in Collision, Peoples of the Sea, etc.) and other unorthodox interpreters of the ancient history of the Middle East. What I found especially noteworthy, is that the Essenes do seem to have been the root of Christianity and that they were already active hundreds of years before Christ. I intend to pursue his line of thought by reading his other books too. The book contains several appendices, a chronology, notes, a bibliography and a thorough index.	2001-05-18

It kicks off with Iggy Pop's fascinating foreword, followed by the equally absorbing preface dealing with Nick Kent's history as a music journalist. The value of each chapter is directly proportional to the communication skills of the interviewee: that is why the Guns 'N'Roses piece is a complete waste of time and paper and shouldn't even have been included in the book, whilst I loved the Roy Orbison interview although I've never really been into his music. I found the Brian Wilson piece too long and do not agree with the author's assessment of the Rolling Stones after the 60s. His view of Kurt Cobain is a bit harsh and the non-interview with Roky Erickson a bit pointless, but I loved Jerry Lee Lewis, Lou Reed, Elvis Costello, Miles Davis and I think the book's crowning glory is the chapter titled &quot;Neil Young and the haphazard highway that leads to Unconditional Love.&quot; I feel compelled to investigate Neil Young's music now because I feel I understand and appreciate him as a human being, whereas previously I considered him to have been just another good rock 'n roller, but one who didn't especially appeal to me. What amazes me is how some of these artists managed to so consistently produce such sublime music while they were abusing themselves physically and mentally to such a gruesome degree. I suppose that is one of the intertextual messages of this book: no matter how low down you are, you can always pull yourself together again. It once again demonstrates the ability of the soul and the body to restore themselves. This is great rock writing!	2001-05-01

First of all, the blurb on the back cover (of my copy at least) makes no grammatical sense whatsoever and could have done with some proofreading. The author does not want to commit himself on whether H2O2 can be taken orally, but does recommend it as a mouthwash instead of using toothpaste. But he doesn't discuss the factor of metal teeth fillings and that H2O2 might corrode these and cause a person to swallow a heavy dose of heavy metal pollutants in the process. As far as taking it orally is concerned, other researchers and alternative healers recommend starting a strong anti-oxidant cocktail a couple of days before one starts oral ingestion of this miracle substance, in the form of supplements or green tea. That makes perfect sense and the author ought to have addressed this subject. This book seems to have been put together without proper editing from the author's newsletter, but does contain other valuable sources of information like a worldwide list of physicians using H2O2 therapy, therapeutic uses of peroxide, metabolic and physiological effects of peroxide healing, an extensive bibliography and an index. I recommend that Dr. Campbell Douglas issues a second edition in which the above flaws are eliminated and that is properly edited and proofread. Until such time, this book is still useful.	2001-04-30

However it still deserves 5 stars for its in-depth treatment of all the major issues and nutrient discoveries up to 1996 and for its readable style.<br />Klatz and Goldman deal with theories of aging, the natural hormones (melatonin, DHEA, hGH etc.), the miracle minerals and vital anti-oxidants, exercise, nutrition and how to handle stress. It's important to note that an anti-aging lifestyle is not only designed to extend one's life, but also to ensure a healthy, happy and quality existence at any age.<br />The chapter on the pioneers of anti-aging medicine and their personal secrets of longevity are particularly interesting and informative. The exercise section is very well illustrated and there are a couple of other graphs and figures to illumine the text.<br />The book contains a glossary, appendices on anti-aging specialists, institutes, research and educational organizations, an extensive bibliography and a thorough index.<br />I would also like to recommend \\"The Superhormone Promise\\" by William Regelson and \\"Renewal\\" by Timothy J.

He describes how stone age explorers discovered all the world's land masses, presents strong evidence for writing before 5000BC and for mathematical, medical and astronomical science as well as tool-making and mining long before the Sumerians. Tracing the human story from the cusp of history back to the earliest known artefacts, he shows that the making of rugs, dental drilling and accountancy among others, were all known in the Neolithic. But not only that - the other &quot;ideological wall&quot; placed at about 40 000BC is also being shown up to be highly dubious as many anomalous cases of earlier symbolic and artistic activities are coming to light. I found the section on language of particular interest and would like to refer interested readers to the work of linguists like Dr. Joseph Greenberg (Language In The Americas, Indo-European and its Closest Relatives: The Eurasiatic Language Family), Merritt Ruhlen (On The Origin Of Languages: Studies In Linguistic Taxonomy), Alan Bomhard (Indo-European and the Nostratic Hypothesis ) and Sydney M.

Lost Civilisations Of The Stone Age is lavishly illustrated with figures, plates and a map of language families, and there's an extensive bibliography and index.

Combining these with the daily use of a multivitamin & mineral supplement plus free-form amino acids may lead to even more impressive results.<br /><br />DHEA & [[ASIN:0895298031 Pregnenolone]] are discussed in chapters one & 2, followed by testosterone in the next two chapters.

Perhaps the book is a bit outdated, since there is no mention of the wonderful amino NAC (N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine) that protects the lungs and mucous membranes and is especially recommended for smokers. The lack of general index and an index to conditions treatable by aminos is a bit of a drawback as this book could be a handy reference work. But four stars overall for an interesting and illuminating text providing much needed information to those who want to take responsibility for their own health.	2001-02-19

I found some parts of this book far more interesting than others, like the core principles of chaos magic, its history and the chapter on servitors with its practical exercises. Chaos magick's non-dogmatic eclectic approach is quite appealing. The section on Ganesh is also helpful, but unfortunately the author sometimes displays some arrogance in &quot;dissing&quot; other paths and movements. Which brings me to a modern metaphysical author like Stuart Wilde, who while not claiming to be a magician, covers the same ground plus much more. And when I had finished the book, I came to the conclusion that one can achieve all you want by studying and applying the guidance of the old metaphysicians like Dr Joseph Murphy and Catherine Ponder, without having to bother with rituals and stuff. But &quot;Condensed Chaos&quot; is still an interesting read and I enjoyed the references to Robert Anton Wilson and Discordianism.	2001-02-19

Books	4	12	12	N	N	REFRESHING APPROACH TO SELF-HELP	Based on the well-known fact that relaxed imaging, or daydreaming, activates the right hemisphere of the brain. This hemisphere is essential for healing, creativity, problem-solving and enjoying meaningful relationships. Dr Stone's book provides a series of exercises (action plans)on &quot;Calling for answers&quot; with your right brain and covers prosperity, health, justice, creativity, protection, intuition and more. I find his approach to self-help original and refreshing, and the book is really a pleasure to read. Also, the exercises are fairly easy to perform and memorize. There is even a reproduction of the mysterious &quot;Solomon's Seal&quot; that one would expect only to find in books on magick. Dr Stone has been a Silva Method lecturer for more than 2 decades and introduced the program to a number of countries. I like his writing style and his acumen for putting across metaphysical concepts in a manner that is easy to understand.	2001-02-16

My favourite passage is &quot;The Epistle To The Paranoids&quot; by Lord Omar, although only the orthodox version appears here. According to the Samaritan codex there is a further (lost) verse which reads: &quot;Ye build high buildings, only to cast yeself from the roofs.&quot; The same codex also contains &quot;The Epistle To The Neurotics&quot; by St. Euthanasius which sadly didn't make it into this edition. These minor gripes aside, I do recommend this work to all those who are searching for a truly personal spirituality and guidance for making sense of life, the universe and everything. A very inspiring work that ought to be appreciated by people of all faiths and persuasions, including atheists.	2001-02-02

The lucid and interesting text serves as a great introduction to all these disciplines for the novice or for those already into esotericism who wish to get an authoritative overview of all these fields. A lot of the illustrations appear here in color for the first time, like Frater Achad's Cosmic Snowflake, the complete set of 22 paintings of the medieval alchemical masterpiece Splendor Solis, and Harry Smith's The Tree Of Life In The Four Worlds and Eye Of The Mysteries. Some of the many artists whose work is featured include Urbino, Leonardo da Vinci, Hieronymus Bosch, Raphael, Rembrandt, Raymond Lull, Botticelli, Poussin, William Blake, Arnold Bocklin, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Vincent van Gogh. My personal favorite works are Alex Grey's \\"Holy Fire\\" and Nicholas Roerich's \\"Mother of the World.\\" Western, Eastern and Egyptian art is given equal weight and some very rare manuscript illustrations and tarot decks are reproduced. There are also portraits of Eliphas Levi, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, Aleister Crowley and Helena Blavatsky. There is a very extensive and useful bibliography of classical occult works. This is a beautiful and inspiring book that also serves as an excellent reference work.	2001-01-31

It is divided into Part 1: Basic Methods for Demonstrating Prosperity and Part 2: Other Ways of Demonstrating Prosperity. I suppose by now nothing is new as many other metaphysical writers have explained these same techniques, but Ponder has a uniquely inspired style and her writings have the capacity for immediately lifting one up out of despondency. I especially loved the following thought from Chapter 9: &quot;There are those people who read self-help books and take numerous success courses, who get the idea that mind power is all there is; that if they just use mind power sufficiently, everything will come their way ... the time usually comes, though, when they realize that [that] is not enough, and they begin to &quot;spin their wheels&quot; spiritually.&quot; I agree with her that practicing the love concept will do more to help one achieve your goals than all the hard mental effort in the world. There is one thing I do not agree with, and that is the dogmatic concept of &quot;tithing&quot; since this idea has been very much abused by organised religion. I do not believe that giving should be prescribed in percentages and here I concur with other great metaphysicians like Dr Joseph Murphy that exact percentages are less important than the spirit of giving. Perhaps the best chapter in this book is the explanation of &quot;divine restoration&quot; which, if practiced, will help more people than all the anti-depressant medication in the world. I salute Catherine Ponder as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, and may her work continue to help and inspire as many people as possible to experience abundance and fulfilment in their lives.	2001-01-26

Wilde's inimitable style, his humor and his love for the individual against the establishment make his writings a great joy to read.

For example, the sun represents power &amp; success, life, money, growth, etc., its positive color is orange, its negative color is yellow or gold, and its magical name is Jehovah Eloh ve Dah-as. So for example if one has a need of money, you would visualize the negative color (yellow/gold) as a next step following the Middle Pillar and vibrate the name. To help someone else who needs money, one would visualize the positive color (orange) and the person concerned and vibrate the name. I have seen the Middle Pillar described using six chakras (Ted Andrews)or all seven chakras where Regardie uses only five (he combines the Throat &amp; Third Eye centres), but I suppose it doesn't matter, since the effect is the same. And the effect is immediate and very tangible. I found Marc Allen's afterword to be helpful (variations of and reflections on the meaning of the Middle Pillar), especially the description of the 2-minute version and the clear explanation of the tree of life. Unlike another reviewer (daniel j walton) I merrily mix eastern and western methods and have been chanting Sanskrit mantras after vibrating the Hebrew names in the middle pillar, and it enhances the feeling and the effect for me. An important little book, very useful for spiritual healers, alternative therapists and for everybody who takes responsibility for their own health.	2001-01-02

Some of them confront the question of whether Indo-European and certain other families had &quot;sprung from some common source.&quot; With comparative linguistics stifling from an excess of caution in recent decades, the search for the answer to that question has here been broadened in an attempt to find a deeper common source than Proto-Indo-Euriopean. This book surveys the progress of genetic classification of languages down the years, records recent developments and indicates abundant opportunities for further research. The contributors include some of the world's leading investigators of genetic classification, such as Robert Austerlitz, Ian Catford, Sheila M. Embleton, Marija Gimbutas, Joseph Greenberg, Winfred P. Lehman, Saul Lebvin, Edgar Polom&eacute;, Jaan Puhvel, Alexis Manaster Ramer, Merritt Ruhlen and Vitaly Shevoroshkin. The contributors look beyond comparative Indo-European linguistics in two ways: (a) by considering genetic relationships outside of the Indo-European family towards sources more ancient than Proto-Indo-European, and (b) by investigating the mythology, religion and cultures of the early Indo-Europeans. Part One contains a general introduction plus a study of the work and influence of Sir William Jones. Part Two discusses the languages and cultures of the Indo-Europeans and gives archaeological insight into the peoples that preceded them. Part Three presents a historical perspective on some problems in the reconstruction of Indo-European and diiscusses some recent work on various hypothesized relationships of Indo-European to other language families. Part Four surveys potential cousins of Indo-European, like Uralic, Altaic and Kartvelian. Part Five deals with methods of investigation, including a note of caution to researchers who might exceed their evidence, techniques that can be used to refine lexicostatistical studies, and a computer programme for developing and testing hypotheses of distant relationships. The book is beautifully illustrated with 15 drawings (in Marija Gimbutas' chapter), and 9 maps.l studies, and a computer programme for developing and testing hypotheses of distant relationships.

The nature of the words is the important factor: the core lexicon which in the main consists of personal pronouns, numerals, body parts and terms for water, blood, moon, sun, night, day and the humble louse.<br /><br />Chapter One deals with the principles of genetic linguistic classification including Greenberg's methodology used for his now universally accepted [[ASIN:0877501157 African classification]], synchronic & diachronic resemblance, sound correspondences & sound changes, multilateral comparison, recoverable vocabulary and petrified grammatical markers. The following chapter examines the unity and bounds of Amerind by providing some of the most striking pieces of evidence like pronominal prefixes indicating the possessor of a noun, ergative markers and first person plural inclusive versus exclusive.<br /><br />Greenberg examines a vast amount of lexical material, mostly Amerind. Chapter Three treats each of the 11 proposed subgroups of Amerind in a separate section with an enumeration of its languages and their classification, plus a brief history of previous taxonomic hypotheses and a set of characteristic etymologies. The following two chapters present the evidence for Amerind as a single macrofamily, with Chapter 4 providing about 1900 lexical etymologies common to two or more subgroups and Chapter 5 pointing out more than 100 grammatical features found across the subgroups.<br /><br />The penultimate chapter discusses the problem of Na-Dene whilst the final one deals with [[ASIN:0804738122 Eurasiatic]], Na-Dene's connection to Dene-Sino-Caucasian and the historical implications for the settling of the Americas by three waves of peoples. This theory receives support from serological and dental evidence. Finally, Table 11 provides a hypothetical list of 14 global language families. Should Niger-Kordofanian & Nilo-Saharan of Africa, Indo-Pacific & Australian of Australasia and the three families North Caucasian, Sino-Tibetan & Na-Dene respectively have a deeper single origin, the number may be reduced to ten.<br /><br />The book contains 4 appendices (on glottochronolgy, mathematical bases of subgrouping, distribution of Amerind etymologies & summary of the classification), 3 maps, a bibliography and 3 indices: Amerind Etymologies, Language Names and General.

The advice is very practical, using simple formulas and techiques that everyone can practice.

Although the book is a joy to read and Dr Murphy is one of my favourite authors, I have to agree with a previous reviewer that there are too many testimonies and that more detailed, step-by-step exercises would have been better. Today there are so many books available on developing your psychic powers that the serious student should perhaps find it easier to start elsewhere (Ted Andrews for example). However, as a good overview on how to impress your subconscious mind to experience the good in life, this is still a valuable work.

Part One traces the message of prosperity down the ages, whilst Part Two contains the highly effective 40-day Prosperity Plan (also available as an audiocassette here on amazon.com) Part Three helps to condition the individual for a better understanding of the energy of money, and Part Four is a compilation of the author's writings on prosperity from his books written prior to 1987. I strongly recommend the 40-Day Prosperity Plan and suggest that the above-mentioned audiocassette be used in conjunction with this book. (Sample affirmation from this plan = &quot;God is lavish, unfailing abundance, the infinite substance of the universe radiating in and through me.

The book is certain to accelerate research towards the ultimate reconstruction of the proto-language and to cast more light on mankind's unknown past, although much needs to be done.<br /><br />But this is disproved by the global etymologies so thoroughly documented here in the form of a phonetic/semantic gloss followed by current examples from many different language families. It is statistically impossible for this to be the result of chance.<br /><br />I found chapter 14: Global Etymologies (co-author John D. Bengtson) the most fascinating. Here 27 global etymologies are extensively and soundly documented in the form of a phonetic/semantic gloss followed by examples from many different languages families. For example [KANO = arm] is found in Khoisan, Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan, Indo-European, Uralic, Dravidian, Caucasian, Sino-Tibetan, Austro-Asiatic, Amerind and many more. The evidence for monogenesis is overwhelming and I hope that this book accelerates research towards the reconstruction of the mother tongue, Proto-Human.<br /><br />In this regard the work of [[ASIN:9027235198 Alan Bomhard]] (Nostratic) and [[ASIN:0804738122 Joseph Greenberg]] (Eurasiatic)is also of great value. Because this work challenges the current orthodoxy it has elicited much venomous criticism from those linguists who claim that genetic relationship cannot be demonstrated after a certain lapse of time.<br /><br />When looking at the Nostratic/Eurasiatic or Dene-Sino-Caucasic reconstructions, the correspondences become more and more obvious. In other words, the further back in time one reconstructs, the clearer the similarities become. Recent advances in biological taxonomy (Cavalli-Sforza) serve to confirm this author's classifications of macro-families, and by implication, monogenesis of all languages.<br /><br />This is a well-written book demonstrating impeccable scholarship and is an exciting read.

These secret teachings deal with the 12 mind powers located within the vital nerve centers in the body. The state of one's health is deeply affected by the state of one's glands because the nerve-gland areas in the body are also centers of vital mind powers. How one uses the mind powers located in the gland-nerve areas affects one's health for the worse or the better. And this book was published in 1967, long before the &quot;chakras&quot; became so popular! Occult philosophy has long recognised that there are seven mind powers located in seven vital nerve centers (the chakras). These 12 powers discussed by Cathereine Ponder simply embrace and expand these 7 natural powers into 12 divinely mental powers, making them easier to understand and use. The 12 healing forces discussed are those of Faith, Strength, Judgement, Love, Power,Imaging, Understanding, Will, Order, Zeal, Elimination and Eternal Life and many healing affirmations are provided for each. There are helpful black and white illustrations mapping the location of these powers and to demonstrate the different levels of mind.

Part One deals with anomalous evidence in the form of bones, eoliths, paleoliths and neoliths and goes on to discuss artifacts and manufactured objects found in ancient strata, plus human skeletal remains. Part Two casts a critical eye on the accepted evidence and demonstrates convincingly how flimsy the evidence of scientific orthodoxy often is. There is also a chapter on Cryptozoology and a final look at the latest finds from Africa. The book is served well with tables summarizing anomalous evidence related to human antiquity, a good index and a massive bibliography of 27 pages. Black and white photographs and illustrations enliven the text. The authors have eloquently made their case in the most thorough and complete detail.

The first part consists of John Price talking about money and your attitude to it, explaining some basic concepts and blowing away the error-thought one often has about money and prosperity in general. He then explains how to use the statements that follow over a 40-day period: there are 10 statements to be used in succession and repeated for four 10-day periods, in other words, one statement per day. This statement for the day can be written down, repeated and meditated upon. The gist of it is that God/The Infinite Spirit IS abundance and wishes to express itself as abundance through the individual. If one has no metaphysical knowledge, the statements might appear strange at first but there's no denying that they work. Following the statements there is a meditation that incorporates the complete message of the statements and finally some more points to ease the flow of abundance into your life (e.g. by cultivating an attitude of giving). Price has a very engaging and reassuring voice that ensures a very pleasant listening experience every time. If you experience any type of lack in your life, follow this program and you'll be amazed by the results. Do not allow your own doubt, worry or cynicism to dismiss this great blessing -- whether you believe it or not, it will work. Sooner or later, depending on the state of your consciousness when you start the program. And best of all, the result is not restricted to money but encompasses abundance in all areas of your life. I sincerely wish that all people who currently experience lack may discover this tape and reap the rich harvest of blessings. God bless you all.	2000-12-27

There is a progressive development of thought through the dozen lectures comprising this book, as they all aim at expressing the same fundamental idea: although the laws of the universe can never be broken, they can be made to work under special conditions which will produce results that could not be produced under the conditions spontaneously provided by nature. This is a simple scientific principle and it shows us the place which is occupied by the personal factor - that of an intelligence which sees beyond the present limited manifestation of the Law into its real essence and which therefore constitutes the means by which the infinite possibilities of the Law can be evoked into forms of power, usefulness and beauty. Thomas Troward had a special gift for explaining the way things are and how they can be - he writes with clarity and great insight and leaves the reader wiser and considerably more positive and joyous about life.

The book describes the work of Royal Rife and of other great pioneers like Dr Arthur Kendall and Dr Edward Rosenow, and how their work was suppressed by certain individuals who at that time were in positions of power in organizations such as the American Medical Association, the Rockefeller Institute and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The explanation of &quot;pleomorphism&quot; is very interesting, i.e. that the cancer micro-organism has 4 forms (also confirmed in the later work of Dr Virginia Livingston-Wheeler) while the Rife (Universal) Microscope, described in Science Magazine, is still years ahead of its time. The last chapter touches on the work of Dr Alan Cantwell (available here on amazon.com). The book has a good bibliography and extensive appendices of correspondence, photographs and articles. A well-written book that is essential reading for all alternative therapists and all people who are willing to take responsibility for their own health. I am fortunate to have the acquaintance of a Rife Practitioner and have witnessed two complete cures of lymphatic cancer plus other diseases in the last 6 months. The good news is that the World Wide Web is spreading the news and the established media have also woken up to the efficacy of the Resonator and vibrational medicine in general. I salute a pioneer like Royal Rife and the great work he achieved - the tragedy is that he was too far ahead of his time.	2000-12-13

People like Ralph Waldo Trine, Katherine Ponder, Raymond Charles Barker, Joseph Murphy and Frederick Bailes are still the best choice to read if you are serious about improving your life. And judging by this wonderful little book., Florence Scovel-Shinn takes pride of place amongst them. With a great economy of words, she makes her point and in simple language explains the benefits of right thinking and how to solve problems. The text is strewn with jewels in the form of uplifting statements and memorable affirmations. Amongst other topics, the laws of prosperity, nonresistance, karma and forgiveness are presented in a fresh way, with clear instructions on how to impress the subconscious. She covers everything that is really important in a book that one can read in a day. Of course, I recommend regular reading of this wonderful manual for living a life of joy.	2000-12-06

Many interesting pages are devoted to the pineal gland. But I'm mystified why the 2nd part of the book should then delve into warnings about cults and certain systems of belief - all very valid in its own right, but it has very little to do with healing and I don't quite see the connection. However the first part still merits 4 stars. Also check out the book [[ASIN:0906006147 Esoteric Healing]] by Dr Douglas M Baker.	2000-12-06

It starts out with an explanation of the power of Belief and is full of common sense advice. It deals with, inter alia, visualization, the subconscious, meditation, love, wealth, friendship, change, charms &amp; mascots, flowers, habits, music, health, time, numerology and astrology, always concentrating on the practical. For example, the old wisdom of not crossing one's limbs when relaxing so that life energy can flow freely. Or sleeping head north, feet south so the earth's energies can revitalize the spirit. The author's engaging style makes it hard to put down as every page exudes a sense of loving, caring and positivity -- an urgent and compelling wake-up call to the reader to experience life to the full. In scanning it now to write this review, I'm tempted to read it for the 4th time again. It's one of those books that rewards you with new insight every time you ope it. A true classic that I recommend to everybody, not just those interested in metaphysics.	2000-12-06

These people all had a nasty shadow side that they tried to compensate for by telling others how to live -- a Jungian analysis of their lives would be very interesting. Unfortunately there is very little analyses but lots of facts and irony, which no doubt contributes to the book's readability. One alternates between feelings of revulsion and amusement and as such the text reads like a thriller. My favourite part is Mary McCarthy's statement on Lilian Hellman: \\"Every word she's ever written is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'\\" and the drama that followed. The greatest of ironies is that some of these repulsive characters are still idolised after their theories have been proven to be flawed, destructive or downright murderous, and after their sickening personalities have been so brilliantly exposed.

Having known very little on the physics side, it has certainly taught me a lot and I am sure these parallels will become even more obvious with advances in the studey of quantum physics. Tao was a great pleasure to read as the author takes pains to be clear and understandable, and the book is lavishly illustrated with plates and drawings. I fround the section on the I Ching hexagrams of particular interest.

According to his chronology, Nibiru should have passed the earth in 100BC, but there is no historical record of any such thing, nor is there evidence of geological upheavals at that time. None of the info in this book is origibal either, I have seen it all before in the work of Robert Bauva, Erich von Daniken and many others. But still an entertaining read.	2000-11-30

It has a great introduction by Colin Wilson and is well illustrated with maps. I just found their speculations on the Aymara language a bit silly, since it is merely a member of the Andean family and ultimately part of the Amerind macro-family, and certainly not an &quot;artificially constructed&quot; language. If they are correct as to the location of Atlantis, another mystery would be the absence of ruins, monuments or any evidence of early human habitation in Tierra del Fuego, southern Chile and Patagonia as these areas would have been temperate and very near to the fabled city. Those reservations aside, it's still a book that makes one think and a valuable addition to the growing corpus of literature on the earth's unknown past.	2000-11-30

I take his theories with a pinch of salt, as his Nibiru chronology doesn't make sense to me (If this 12th planet is supposed to come round every 3600 years and cause havoc on earth, it was supposed to have come round in 100BC according to Sitchin's own chronology). But there is no record of any such thing happening in 100BC! So perhaps Nibiru veered off out of the solar system and is now drifting aimlessly through the cosmos! Ha, that would serve the Anu right for having so selfishly interfered on earth.	2000-11-30

Sitchin's books are always a pleasure to read with the author's engaging style and bold assertions, but the most obvious hole in his theory is that there is NO evidence of any cataclysm or upheaval in 100BC when Nibiru was supposed to have passed the earth according to the author's own chronology. He claims it comes by every 3600 years and that it caused the great upheavals and the end of the last ice age in about 10 000 BC. Also, he makes stupid statements about linguistic affinity and does not work like a scientist here. It is easy enough to find similarities between a language in Eurasia and one in the Americas, but one must put this in context, in a broader taxonomy (classification structure). There are similarities between Sumerian and Nostratic (Eurasiatic) the parent family of Indo-European and many others, and also (other)similarities between Sumerian and Dene-Caucasic. For these, I recommend the work of professional linguists like Alan Bomhard, Joseph Greenberg and Merritt Ruhlen. Sitchin takes many liberties but at least he does it in an entertaining way.	2000-11-30

Indo-European, Uralic-Yukaghir, Kartvelian, Eskimo-Aleut etc etc as well as Sumerian. History of research and methodology are presented, followed by a survey of the Nostratic languages and discussions of the development of the phonological systems of the Indo-European parent and daughter languages, plus developments in IE's sister languages. Indo-European and Nostratic are then compared by phonology and morphology, proving the truth of the Glottalic Theory of IE via Nostratic reconstruction.  The fascinating chapter 6 investigates a Nostratic homeland and the dispersal of the daughter languages, based on archaeology. The work of Aaron Dolgopolsky, John C Kerns and Henrik Birnbaum is quoted at length, and the author's conclusion is that the Nostratic language with its Mesolithic culture had its origin in or near the Fertile crescent just south of the Caucasus, 15 000 to 12 000 before the current era. There are 9 maps indicating inter alia the Nostratic and IE homelands and the dispersal of these languages plus the spread of agriculture from 8 000 bce to 5 000 bce. The next chapter deals with problem areas and future prospects and includes discussions on Altaic, Etruscan, and Sumerian. Finally, the common Nostratic roots are presented, including new material and replacements of existing etymologies.

The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are the God process in the individual. This wonderful work provides a spiritual technique for richer living. Chapters deal with, inter alia, Happiness, Wealth, Love, Success and Freedom, and includes helpful affirmations and prayers. On a par with the work of Joseph Murphy, Catherine ponder and Florence Scovel-Shinn, this book should be read repeatedly to provide the maximum benefit.	2000-11-13

A thorough discussion of the background, lore, history and application of sound in healing, together with Vedic cosmology and the views of scientists, as well as pieces on Karma, Astrology and the Chakras. All the important areas of life are covered and the various relevant mantras provided, with phonetic guide to pronunciation and English translation.

I strongly recommend you get the CD at the same time (available here on amazon) as it helps immensely in \\"getting into\\" the mantra habit and with pronunciation. It is also very beautiful to listen to. The book has a glossary of Sanskrit and other terms, an extensive bibliography and an index.	2000-11-01

The section on the Bach Flower Remedies is the most interesting and informative I have ever found on the subject and contains beautiful color and black &amp; white illustrations of the plants concerned, plus a striking illustration of how the vibrations in the remedies swirl in and around the body after you've taken them. Instructions on how to prepare the remedies are provided. The next section deals with alcoholism, its esoteric significance and healing. Some of the text can only be understood if one is familiar with the vocabulary of Theosophy (rays, etc), but other parts are easier to grasp - a relevant letter of Carl Jung is printed in full. This sections also contains impressive illustrations, the most frightening of which is an instance of astral vampires attaching an alcoholic in sleep. Treatments for alcoholism are given with special reference to psychology and the flower remedies. This is followed by a long illuminating section on the Vagus nerve (Man's Psychic Aerial) and the charkas. The work concludes with an essay on holistic methods of healing and there are fold-out maps of the flower remedies and their use, ear-stimulation acupuncture points and feet-massage reflexology points. A very impressive work to be read again and again, and an essential reference work for practitioners of alternative healing.	2000-10-30

First, the Thymus connection makes perfect sense from the perspective of esoteric healing - AIDS sufferers show a problem in the esoteric body in the heart (thymus) chakra long before symptoms appear. In my practical experience, the use of the Zapper certainly does abort influenza very effectively. And the parasite program (3 herbs, l-cysteine and coenzyme Q10) did finally clear up a persistent parasite infection in the leg and foot of a friend of mine. It also needs to be said that the author's parasite theory of infection was published long before the outbreak of &quot;mad cow&quot; disease in the United Kingdom in the mid-90s. Part One discusses parasites as the vessel of the HIV retrovirus, the role of pollutants (esp. benzene) and how to counteract these. Part Two gives detailed instructions on how to avoid pollutants, including a section on dentistry. Part three includes case histories, testing for infection and pollutants, how to build a zapper, and recipes for pollution-free food, beverages, household products and cosmetics. The section on dentistry and some of the dietary recommendations appear a little bit extreme to me, but the recommendations on the use of colloidal silver and hydrogen peroxide make perfect sense. &quot;Quackery&quot; this certainly is not, and until allopathic medicine can come up with an effective cure, this book may well contain the answers for a better and longer life. Highly recommended for all practitioners of alternative healing modalities.	2000-10-30

Originally published in 1957, it was way ahead of its time since the  mind-body connection is only now starting to be taken seriously by  mainstream medicine and the public at large. The author's metaphysical  interpretation of scripture is certainly wholesome and uplifting, as  opposed to those fundamentalist/literal interpretations that are so  destructive. There are references to Thomas Troward (see his book &quot;The  Creative Process In The Individual&quot; which I recommend). This is an  excellent guide for all holistic healers.

Through the years I have always been frustrated by the lack of a lyric  sheet with Patti Smith's albums. I thought her marriage of poetry and rock  deserved better. And there were many parts of her songs that I just  couldn't make out, what with her broad NY drawl, so this book came as a  godsend. And yes, I was invariably wrong in my guessing!

This opus magnum (first of three volumes that will ultimately constitute a  guide to the world's languages) addresses the genetic classification of  languages. I'm not a trained linguistic but have a passionate interest in  historical linguistics and I found this book easy to digest and  illuminating. For a state-of-the-art reference work on classification,  there is no equivalent! In each language family, the author traces the  history of classification within that group and concludes with the very  latest research. Each chapter has its own exhaustive bibliography and there  is a bibliographic update. The book is illustrated with 21 helpful maps  indicating the geographical spread of language families whilst countless  tables and figures support the text. There are personal name, language  group and language indexes plus a detailed Complete Classification  comprising 77 pages. The last chapter, Postscript 1991, is the most  fascinating of all since here the author discusses long-range comparisons,  Nostratic/Eurasiatic, Amerind, Dene-Caucasian, human genetics as per the  work of Cavalli-Sforza (Fig. 9.2: Comparison of the genetic tree and  linguistic phyla). I highly recommended this work to all who are interested  in linguistics, anthropology and the history of the human race.	2000-08-31

I happened to be reading Robert Anton Wilson's  Cosmic Trigger Vol. 1 at the same time and found full confirmation there of  at least one type of nature spirit. I found the book so engrossing that I  didn't stop long enough to properly do the exercises so I cannot at this  stage confirm whether they really work in establishing communication - once  or twice I did get a feeling of otherwordliness though, when doing the  mystic marriage. But merely reading it certainly raises one's awareness.  This volume is well illustrated to explain the exercises, energy bodies  plus the aforementioned symbols of the archangels. Includes a bibliography  for further reading. I recommend the book strongly since it encapsulates  all the necessary information in one place, whereas other self-help books  carry only bits and pieces.	2000-08-30

2310062:US	50057481	R2U3U9K0I8L65C	0875166407	567454459	The Creative Process in the Individual	Books	5	83	89	N	N	Consciousness and creativity	Thomas Troward believed that speculative reasoning based on what is known is the best way of metaphysical investigation. This classic work attempts to trace the sequence of continuous creation by logical deduction with reference to the law of cause & effect. It is important to bear in mind the triumph of principle over precedent, meaning that ideas become manifest despite the absence of past experience, as in the case of the development of aviation. Troward conveys profound concepts with clarity; no knowledge of theological terminology is required. He encourages the reader to contemplate these ideas and assimilate them if they help to make [[ASIN:1604244720 the meaning of the Bible]] clearer.<br /><br />Troward calls the creative process the Self-contemplation of Spirit. The twofold essence of nature comprises (i) the unity of a universal creative principle & (ii) multiplicity in manifestation. He posits a sequence of cause & effect universal in nature that harmoniously includes all possible variations of individual expression. Two factors are projected from a common source: individual consciousness and energy-matter. Their relation to each other becomes an absolute fact regarding these factors themselves. The cosmos is thus no illusion. Creation proceeds from the operation of Divine Will upon both the \\"soul\\" of nature (in a sequence of progressive condensation) and the localization of its mind in the individual.<br /><br />The author identifies the substantive properties of Spirit as love, light, power, peace, beauty & joy and its actions as initiative & selection. If Love itself is the original motive for creation, the divine ideal is that of individuality that recognizes its source. The need for a standard of personality becomes essential owing to matters of resonance & [[ASIN:1584200170 harmony]]. Taking the nature of Divine Spirit as blueprint is the way; this must be done by individual choice & free will. Alternatives like the personal force of will, magical rites, affliction of the body or the invocation of spirits deny the Eternal.<br /><br />The transition from the collective operation of the Creative Spirit on mankind to its specific operation on the individual corresponds to the concept of the [[ASIN:B0006BGWSC octave]]. Choosing the personality pattern of the Source means selecting the eternal essence and being of life itself. This requires the rejection of the species-standard and embracing the Spirit standard that enables the localized consciousness to grow with the [[ASIN:1932236473 The Eternal Divine]] through communication & action.<br /><br />The will of God is Life according to [[ASIN:068815994X Scripture]] & common sense. Rejoicing in the life of the Spirit establishes reciprocity of reflection - the law of action and reaction. The initiative to interact with & relate individually to the Creator springs from a yearning of the heart. When realized it enriches the individual personality by an endless flow of life expanding intelligence, love, power & joy in harmony with Spirit. Having recognized the error of time & space being the essence of life, a close relationship develops with the Creator. Prayer in its essence really means \\"Lord, please give me more of Yourself,\\" a fact reflected in Holy Communion. Receiving the Divine Spirit is symbolized by bread & wine as representatives of energy-matter & life.<br /><br />Troward explains the role of cause and effect in The Divine Offering that assures mankind of God's love and [[ASIN:0275943798 restorative power]]. Troward addresses several objections to the sacrifice of Christ, the Resurrection and the forgiveness of past sins. When time has no substantial existence, states of consciousness are all that remain; thus sins of the past have no existence (have been removed from the individual as far as the east is from the west). The Redeemer's sacrifice is the supreme manifestation of the interaction of law and personality. Redemption is the realization of the individual's eternal and perfect relation to the Father; it neutralizes fear, an emotion arising from unbelief in the love of God. Redemption as a manifestation of divine love, when properly understood, leaves no ground for fear.<br /><br />I find it interesting that the scholar Geza Vermes in [[ASIN:014100360X The Authentic Gospel of Jesus]] came to the very same conclusion as Troward regarding the way Jesus/Yeshua viewed the nature of God. With reference to, amongst others, the parable of the Prodigal Son, the portrait that emerges is that of a loving Father. There is no trace of severity or harshness in the God of Jesus who is a Father more than a King. With reference to the parable of the Prodigal Son, Troward highlights two great errors: (a) limiting the power of God by our own past experiences (b) thinking of Spirit as an impersonal \\"cosmic force\\" & thus believing that mankind must provide the intelligence for the creative process.<br /><br />Animus Dei (Spirit of God) is the principle of personality whilst Anima Mundi (soul of nature) is impersonal. Both infinite, they are complementary to one another. Anima Mundi or the soul of nature, revealed by the Law of Tendency in the material world, lacks the ability of individual selection. Being active, Divine Personality upholds nature as well as human personality. However, Anima Mundi is impressionable so both the Divine and human personalities influence nature.<br /><br />The power of the soul of man over the soul of nature is psychic. The author remarks that a sufficiently powerful concentration of will would produce dramatic effects through the Anima Mundi which might explain scriptural statements regarding the signs & wonders to be performed by three main figures at the conclusion of the present age. Troward warns the reader about philosophies that deny the personality of God; the logical result is to elevate the self to the status of deity, which is a form of idolatry that promotes [[ASIN:1400052947 malignant narcissism]].<br /><br />The book concludes with Trowards observations on the sound philosophy, reason & science in the [[ASIN:0060630043 Good Book]], how these confirm the law of cause & effect and ultimately direct mankind to a new consciousness when God's perfect laws will live within our hearts & minds as promised in Jeremiah 31 and various other passages.the Father; it neutralizes fear, an emotion arising from unbelief in the love of God.

Side A is the ?ah? side for manifesting what you want  via Siddhi Consciousness which is induced by controlled breathing and  repeating the ?ah? sound while imagining an energy flow between your root  and third eye chakras. (Interesting that the name of the deity has this  sound in most languages - God, Brahma, Shiva, Krishna, Allah, Tao, Ra etc.)  Side B is expressing gratitude through the ?aum? sound. Soon I had some  transcendent (and scary) moments because you can feel something happening  at the third eye - my dogs who meditate on top of and around me, also got a  bit frightened once or twice. But it was worth the effort because the  manifestation did take place. Now I use this tape perhaps once a month for  the pleasure of it.

The hardcover  edition has a classy black &amp; gold dust jacket. This book is essential  for all Lou Reed fans, for pleasure reading and as a reference.	2000-07-18

She shows one how to turn on the  corrective thoughts in order to change the whole pattern of your life for  the better. It is explained that everybody can use these ancient healing  laws and there's nothing mysterious about them. In fact, healing constantly  takes place in our lives in simple ways that seem miraculous. We all have  the healing power, if we only realize it. The healing laws include: The  &quot;No&quot; law, &quot;Surprise&quot; law, Law of Release, the  &quot;Yes&quot; law, Praise law, Law of love, Miracle law, Occult law,  Imaging law &amp; the Mystical law. Countless examples of healing are  provided to demonstrate these laws in action. A pleasure to read and a book  that substantially expands one's consciousness. Should be on every healer'  bookshelf.	2000-07-10

An incredible, amazing book that reads like a thriller. It covers the field of brainwaves (alpha, theta, etc) as a door to the subconscious mind, the author's use of an  alpha meter and his fascinating exploration of how to induce these  receptive brainwave states. He tells of his research with various drugs in  inducing altered states: acid, alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates,  marijuana etc. He also deals with the chakras, yoga, meditation, hypnosis  and nutrition in great detail. Other topics encompass the male/female  forces, sex ecology, psychic power, the brotherhood of light, the master  self, the master game and the master plan. A charming read on many levels  and a treasure trove of mystical insight.  I have also read the author's  Three Little Words but for me this book is far better. I originally read  this book in one day because I couldn't tear myself away, and soon I'll  read it again, but this time I'll study it properly by reading a chapter a  day. Essential reading for those interested in metaphysics,  self-improvement and all aspects of the esoteric. Fans of especially Stuart  Wilde's books will love it!	2000-07-07

Reveals the human being and chronicles the ups and downs and the artistry  of Reed, for a &quot;thorough dissection of the Rock 'n Roll animal&quot; -  and this animal has sharp fangs and a tendency to bite, one might add. The  author is obviously a fan, but a very honest writer who never hesitates to  tackle controversial issues. Very interesting also for the light it throws  on other artists and sometime collaborators like John Cale, Nico and Patti  Smith.

You can find out exactly what melatonin is, why  it is called the \\"master hormone,\\" who should take it as a  supplement, its use as a sleeping pill, safety aspects, and how it helps  the body in many different ways. Not only is melatonin a powerful  anti-oxidant, but it also boosts the immune system in a variety of ways.  Contains a very useful glossary and extensive bibliographies by chapters.

Recent developments in science have shown that the old notions of the body functioning independently of the mind, attitudes, emotions, personality  characteristics etc. are untrue. Whether it's a matter of saying young, fit  and healthy or recovering from disease, the mind is crucial in the ultimate  outcome. The book teaches you how to take control of your own state of  health and how to improve your wellness with proven mental techniques. The  text is illustrated by humorous cartoons, there is a  &quot;Self-Responsibility Quiz&quot; for the reader to fill in (to gauge  your state of wellness) and a good bibliography. The core of the book is  The 7 Fundamentals (1. The Real You, 2. Thoughts Are Things, 3. Forgive And  Let Go, 4. Love Cancels Fear, 5. Acceptance Is Mastery, 6. Interdependence,  7. Do It Now). I found this an enjoyable read but would also like to  recommend Dr. Taylor's wide variety of subliminal cassettes. Choose from  the amazing range of subjects and technologies and use the appropriate  tapes in conjunction with this book. It will bring about astonishing  improvements in your enjoyment of life.	2000-07-06

It details the origins of the US  punk and art rock scene, like Patti Smith, Tom Verlaine, Richard Hell &  The Ramones who were the originators of many stylistic and musical traits  evident in latter-day bands. It's an American punk Who's Who and  a rock 'n  roll What's What, a detailed history and a valuable reference work.  Starting with the Velvet Underground, it covers The Stooges, MC5, Modern  Lovers, Electric Eels, Suicide, NY Doll, Wayne County, Blondie, The  Heartbreakers, Talking Heads, Pere Ubu, Lydia Lunch and other seminal  artists.  This is done in the form of interviews with the artists  concerned, so you hear about the times in their own words. The famous  venues CBGB's & Max's Kansas City also get their due. The bibilography  provides a cross-section of the most useful published sources on American  punk an there's an extensive discography. Black & white photographs  (some very rare, like a pic of Patti Smith's graduation) enliven the text.  Highly recommended for fans of intelligent rock music.	2000-07-06

Wilde has a very unique style of  writing and all his books are interesting - I just don't think the  suggested exercises always work or are always applicable.

For  example, it explains in a clear and understandable way the qualities of and  relationship between spirit, mind and matter. It furthermore provides  welcome insights on universal healing principles and how to build a strong  faith. As I was reading it for the first time, I found myself looking at  the original publication date (1941) in total disbelief. Way back then, the  author knew all the basics of what today is called PNI and NLP and much  more besides.

Practicing the  exercises enhances your sense of well-being and provides valuable insights  about how to protect yourself against psychic and other forms of attack.  There is nothing weird or occult about these simple exercises, in fact,  they make perfect sense. Ancient techniques like the &quot;Tower Of  light&quot; are explained and there are handy relaxation techniques.

A  particular pleasure is finding information on the more obscure hitmakers  like R Dean Taylor (a solitary Canadian on Tamla Motown who gave us Indiana  Wants Me &amp; Gotta See Jane), UK experimentalists like Curved Air and  East Of Eden, punk pioneers like X-Ray Spex and The Adverts.

Side One includes: I Love Myself The Way I Am (song)/I Love Myself meditation/Prosperity Meditation/Road To Prosperity (a  bouncy reggae song). Side Two includes: Open Up Your Vision (song)/Parent  Child meditation/Remembering and Forgetting (song). For me, the standout  track is the &quot;I Love Myself&quot; meditation, with Hay's beautiful  warm voice planing new positive seeds in one's subconscious mind. A very  effective tape and a pleasure to listen to again and again.	2000-06-28

Unlike that one, here Louise Hay employs professional vocalists to sing or chant parts of the  meditations. The meditations usually start with beautiful synthesizer &amp;  piano music, followed by her spoken word and then goes into a sung chorus.  The overall effect is very dreamy, otherwordly even, and certainly  extremely effective for relaxation and healing. Listening to this cassette  on a regular basis is far more effective than just reading a book on  self-help, since songs and the spoken word are taken up by the subconscious  mind with no effort on your part except for listening regularly. And it's  so beautiful you WANT to listen to it every day. This woman is a living  saint.	2000-06-27

For about a week I woke up with &quot;dunes&quot; of sand in my eyes so I must have been  crying a lot in my sleep. Louise has an incredibly warm, comforting voice  and she obviously knows a lot about psychology, which she applies to  wonderful effect in a very loving way. The first meditation is called Your  Healing Light, and it's just her voice with piano and a bit of synth. It's  a perfect intro and I have subsequently been using it as a soundtrack for  when I give reiki healing treatments. The meditations follow one another  like golden sonic waves, all of them addressing some vital issue or  another. Many of the beautiful phrases have stuck in my mind, like  &quot;there's a part of you that is more than your past, more than your  relationships and more than your personality ...&quot; and &quot;I move  from success to success, from joy to joy and from abundance to  abundance&quot; and &quot;I am open and receptive to all good.&quot; This  tape also taught me how to forgive people that I did not want to forgive or  did not know how. After about 2 weeks I experienced a dramatic improvement  in my outlook on life. I have subsequently moved on to far more  technologically advanced cassettes (Eldon Taylor &amp; Paul Scheele) but  for sheer human warmth and understanding, nobody comes close to Louise Hay.  I would strongly recommend this cassette to anybody who has been abused in  any way or who is depressed or feels helpless. It is uncanny, but I think  there a type of vibration emanating from this cassette, which is more than  the sum total of her voice and her words.	2000-06-27

In the author's own words, it's about \\"records, performances, twists of the radio  dial.\\" It moves from the Sex Pistols' \\"Anarchy\\" to Nirvana's  \\"Nevermind\\" in this illumined golden thread. Marcus writes about  what moved, scared and disgusted him and what made him feel so privileged  to be part of the punk audience. His views of punk encompassed a wide  horizon, to include the likes of Bruce Springsteen, early Prince, Laurie  Anderson and David Lynch's film Blue Velvet. His point is that punk made  wonderful things like Anderson's \\"Superman\\" possible even though  Superman itself isn't punk. In other words, punk's liberating effect caused  sea changes in the perception of pop. A major weakness of the book is that  it ignores the entire New York scene, because, as he puts it, \\"most  [New York] punks seemed to be auditioning for careers as something  else.\\" So no Patti Smith, no Richard Hell, a cursory mention of  Talking Heads, but you WILL  find Blondie here. Fascist Bathroom follows  many avenues (The Clash, Sex Pistols, Elvis Costello) but maybe its most  precious contribution is rescuing from obscurity some lower-profile such as  Laura Logic, The Mekons, Marianne Faithfull. It's a joy to read,  chronologically arranged and ending with Nirvana and grunge in the 90s. The  text swarms with relevant quotes from rock lyrics and references to other  rock journalists like Lester Bangs. For anyone with a passionate interest  in rock/pop music and youth culture, it's required reading.	2000-06-27

Don't be put off by Andrea Juno's introduction where her sometimes valid concerns alternate with obscurantist ramblings. Yes, she talks about e.g. \\"alternative discourses and economies\\" but she's not quite a moonbat and proves herself a deft & intelligent interviewer. There's a Women in Rock map of Canada & the USA with the names of female musicians geographically arranged; I was pleased to see [[ASIN:0815410468 Marianne Faithfull]] located just off the coast of South Carolina, representing the UK with 3 other artists. A discography & list of equipment used by the musician/s appear on the final page of every musician interview.<br /><br />My favorite artist, [[ASIN:B001F4YH68 Jarboe]] (ex [[ASIN:B00000I60J Swans]]) is the first interviewee; congrats to both Juno & Jarboe for a constantly engaging discussion & absolute honesty on topics that encompass everything from popular music, the music business, childhood, family & growing up, other prominent artists, the media, relationships, culture & much else besides. Lots of original & some controversial photographs & a few album covers adorn this interview. I found info here that is not available anywhere else.<br /><br />Some of the artists are beyond what you might call \\"obscure,\\" like Tribe 8, Valerie Agnew, Lois Maffeo & Naomi Yang. In between, I would say, come Kathleen Hanna, Kendra Smith & [[ASIN:B00000FBS9 Phranc]], whilst June Millington (Fanny), [[ASIN:B000FKP41U Joan Jett]] & Chrissie Hynde (Pretenders) were celebrities in their day. I was particularly impressed by the last; not only do I share most of [[ASIN:B00004YL2X Chrissie's]] opinions but she expresses them with an appealing eloquence. Two of the interviews are with the record label owners Candice Pedersen & Bettina Richards.<br /><br />It came as a pleasant surprise that none of these lovely women are irrational or particularly furious, or if they are angry, they express their concerns in an intelligible & articulate way. (Sigh ... this was the 1990s, just before the arrival of the ranting Moonbat). And I love the beautifully illustrated front & back cover and rare pictorial material found throughout the book; the format & presentation are quite special. Serious rock fans, sane feminists (like [[ASIN:0679751203 Camille Paglia]]), fans of the interviewees and devotees of [[ASIN:0940642212 Re/Search]] Publications will love it.

The photographs provide fascinating insight  into the chronological documentation of a man and his music: from a sweet  little boy at Syracuse University in 1963 to world weary drug casualty in  the 70s, to happily married, reformed survivor in the 90s. Interesting  pictures include the cover of the original trashy expos&eacute; \\"The Velvet  Underground\\" by [[ASIN:1902588827 Michael Leigh]] (the book from which the band took their  name), posters and tickets of Warhol's multi-media Exploding Plastic  Inevitable show, rare records and record covers and exotic underground  comics featuring Reed and the band. There's also a poignant picture of [[ASIN:0954773748 Nico]] and one of Warhol taken just before his death in 1986. Wrenn uses Reed's own words to present a powerful self-critiqe of the artist in all his  facets - musician, writer, poet, performer. The result is a remarkable  insight into a man who has pushed himself and his music to the edge but who  has survived with his cutting edge sharper than ever. Like this Reed qote: \\"All I ever wanted to do was to make records that adults could listen  to without wincing, rather than all that 'rock below the waist' stuff.  There's pop music, then there's what I do. I consider myself a  writer.\\"	2000-06-27
2401265:US	50057481	R9YMOHSL66VU9	0823076695	457366775	Secret History of Rock: The Most Influential Bands You've Never Heard	Books	5	5	6	N	N	DEFINITIVE REFERENCE WORK	In the introduction, the author observes that the most original rock musicians of the 1990s -- for example Sonic Youth and Nirvana -- were defined and distinguished by the influence of obscure artists from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. In this instance, the aforementioned bands credited Glenn Branca, Can, Half Japanese and Wire for their inspiration. Likewise, R.E.M., Beastie Boys, Butthole Surfers and Nine Inch Nails spread the word about their particular heroes and inspirations so that the influence of the \\"unknowns\\" has increased exponentially amongst the most creative young artists.<br /><br />These innovators from the preceding decades may be considered the \\"musicians' musicians\\" as opposed to commercial giants like the Beatles, the Stones, Led Zep, the Police and Springsteen who were embraced by millions and may therefore be called the \\"people's musicians.\\" Thus Sarig shows that there are two histories of rock, that of the mainstream and that of the little-known but heavily influential which represents the secret history of the title.<br /><br />The book pays tribute to the bands, composers and performers whose enduring influence outweighs their popularity by far. Sarig interviewed numerous notable and successful 1990s musicians and in some cases drew on previous interviews in order to identify their favorite artists from earlier eras. The final list in Secret History was determined by 4 factors, the (a) ratio of influence to obscurity (b) popularity of the bands influenced (c) balance of genres and chapters (d) quality of the responses.<br /><br />The result is a delightful sojourn through the most innovative and creative sounds of the 20th century. Modern classical composers like Erik Satie, John Cage, LaMonte Young, The Dream Syndicate, Philip Glass and Glenn Branca fill the first chapter. Then follows what Sarig terms the 'international pop underground' where names like [[ASIN:B00004TREG Scott Walker]], Big Star and Serge Gainsbourg stand out. The Stooges, MC5, Syd Barrett and Roky Erickson reside under 'garage rock' whilst [[ASIN:B000FDJ2VK Captain Beefheart]], The Residents and Pere Ubu are classified as 'absurdists and eccentrics.'<br /><br />Chapter 6: Frayed Roots includes singer-songwriters Gram Parsons and [[ASIN:0747535035 Nick Drake]]. The author's choice of Krautrock masters encompasses Can, Faust, Kraftwerk and Neu!. Brian Eno, the Jamaican Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry and Adrian Sherwood are amongst those designated as 'sound sculptors.' Sarig's most influential 'New York rockers' include Swans, DNA, The Feelies, Richard Hell & the Voidoids, Television and ASIN:B000040OBS Suicide. He populates 'the post-industrial wasteland' with inter alia [[ASIN:B000024P3P Throbbing Gristle]], Einst&uuml;rzende Neubauten and The Birthday Party.<br /><br />Public Image Limited, Wire, Buzzcocks, The Fall, Gang of Four and Swell Maps receive the honors for 'British post-punk' while riot moms and [[ASIN:0965104206 angry women']] include The Slits, X-Ray Spex, The Raincoats and [[ASIN:B000003H46 Lydia Lunch]]. Other chapters are devoted to genres titled 'original rappers' (Gil Scott-Heron), 'minimalist funk,' (Liquid Liquid), 'American hardcore' (Dead Kennedys) and 'avant punk USA' (Mission of Burma).<br /><br />A brief introduction to the genre opens each chapter, followed by Sarig's historical overview of a representative band/individual which is interrupted by quotes from their 90s admirers and concludes with a discography of the act. For example, [[ASIN:B00000I60J Swans]] is the final group in chapter 10: New York Rockers. Their entry opens with a quote by David Yew. Sarig's essay on the band's history and significance is interspersed by quotes from Thurston Moore, Mark Robinson of Unrest/Air Miami, Ryan Adams of Whiskeytown and Lou Barlow of Sebadoh. It concludes with a discography arranged chronologically from Filth (1983) to [[ASIN:B000004AT1 Swans Are Dead]] (1997).<br /><br />Although some narratives lack cohesion and many are rendered rather messy by the disruptive quotes, I award the work 5 stars because of my favorite artists that receive recognition here: [[ASIN:B0000033AE John Cale]], Captain Beefheart, The Residents, Nick Drake, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno, Suicide, Richard Hell, Throbbing Gristle, Lydia Lunch & [[ASIN:B0000633JK X-Ray Spex]].

It explores the life of Nico after the [[ASIN:B000002G7C Velvet Underground]], covering her life in London and tours of Europe, the USA and Japan in the 1980s.<br /><br />I found myself devouring the text in utter fascination. It includes descriptions of bizarre performances, wild parties, weird tour experiences, eccentric characters like her one-time manager Dr Demetrius, encounters with luminaries like [[ASIN:1582340684 John Cale]], a visit to the motel where Tom Waits used to stay and much much more.<br /><br />The Preface covers Nico's family background, her career as model, the first move to New York, her role in Fellini's [[ASIN:B00005JKGO La Dolce Vita]], involvement with The Rolling Stones and later [[ASIN:030681272X Andy Warhol]] and the Factory crowd. Post Velvet Underground she went solo and made some great albums with the help of John Cale, eventually settling in Manchester in the UK.<br /><br />The author met her in 1981 and thus this biography deals with the last seven years of her life. The first tour was that of Italy, the next of the USA that included shows in Detroit, Denver, and Chicago. In LA the band stayed at The Tropicana where [[ASIN:1560256672 Tom Waits]] made his residence at the time. One of the funniest parts is the narrative of Nico's first experience with angel dust in Los Angeles. The tour concluded in New York.<br /><br />Then came the performances with Gregory Corso in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. A highlight of the narrative is Nico's show at the Free University in Berlin, where she made the mistake of singing [[ASIN:B001KNVJAG Deutschland &uuml;ber Alles]], causing a riot. Fortunately, her harmonium shielded her against the hailstorm of beer bottles.<br /><br />Back in Manchester, there was an interesting encounter with the punk poet [[ASIN:0948238283 John Cooper Clarke]] and John Cale in a bad patch of his life. At a studio in Shoreditch he produced her album [[ASIN:B0000072K5 Camera Obscura]] which was launched with a powerful performance at Chelsea Town Hall. Allen Ginsberg appears in the chapter Suspicious Minds whilst other beats like Carolyn Cassady also make an appearance.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000A3X72A Eric Random]] joined the band just before the European tour that encompassed Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland (where Nico managed to score opium behing the then Iron Curtain) and Spain. Australia and New Zealand came next and then Japan. The book concludes with an account of her death and funeral in 1988.<br /><br />Underneath the humor there is a lot of sadness too but it is a strangely inspiring read. Songs They Never Play On The Radio is a gem on many levels and transcends the genre of rock writing. Only Marianne Faithfull's [[ASIN:0007245815 Memories, Dreams and Reflections]] comes close. You don't have to be a fan of Velvet Underground to enjoy this classic work, as it offers much humor, wit and arresting portraits of a colorful array of personalities.and John Cale in a bad patch of his life.

Note that Supraliminal means consciously unnoticed whilst Subliminal means consciously not perceivable. The book focuses on subliminal communication as a means to make the subconscious work for the individual & as a warning to protect one's mind against unwanted influences. We are constantly bombarded by subliminal messages through the electronic & print media. The controversial book [[ASIN:097884310X The Hidden Persuaders]] by Vance Packard is discussed, an early warning against psychological manipulation.<br /><br />Taylor explains how subliminal self-help recordings work, the evidence, implications & the question of whether it is able to effect basic changes in personality structure. Chapter one deals with the history which goes back to 1863. In 1894, W R Dunham wrote a seminal treatise [[ASIN:B0006AEUG4 The Science of Vital Force]] of which an interesting excerpt is provided. In his book [[ASIN:0451097238 The Clam Plate Orgy]], Wilson Bryan Key illustrates disguised content in art and advertising.<br /><br />In the chapter Mechanics, the author refers to the aforementioned Wilson B Key's [[ASIN:0451061489 Subliminal Seduction]] with reference to our perceptual defense mechanisms of denial, fantasy formation, introjection, isolation, projection, regression, repression & sublimation. Some parts get a bit too technical perhaps, but then again, professionals will find that valuable.<br /><br />The chapter on Clinical Data explores those areas of activity that are demonstrably affected by subliminal communication: conscious perception,dreams, drives, emotions, memory, perceptual defenses, value norm anchor points and verbal behavior. Taylor also discusses further fields of activity affected by subliminals as suggested by the clinical data.<br /><br />In the chapter Subliminal Technology, [[ASIN:1559780347 the author]] provides definitions of the terms Supraliminal, Subception & Subliminal and explains the methods of audio- & videosubliminal projection, including the use of masked messages on popular music recordings. The next chapter, Scientific Findings, presents data drawn from contemporary studies, including those of doctors Lloyd Silverman and Norman Dixon as well as his own research.<br /><br />The section on how wave patterns created by sound can be displayed visually is most fascinating.
