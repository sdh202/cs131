This of course is quite a common practice at the school since hotels in the village left much to be desired.

So, poor little girl, she now has to cope with a guest in her house.... and ... considering that her husband took off when he should have been there that week to accompany her to a marriage counselor didn't help much either. Anna may not know much about life, love and her body but she was sure that what she had isn't what all her grilfriends said she shoud expect from a husband. The fact that he takes exactly 6 minuts and four seconds to make love to her, the fact that he didn't want her to wear sexy underthings, the fact that she wasn't allowed to move during their lovemaking, and finally the fact that she always thought of her grocery list during their lovemaking, convinced Anna that there must be more to life than this ....  <br /> <br /> <br />Well Anna was in for a very pleasant surprise .....  <br /> <br /> <br />The author gently takes Anna and the reader down a soft gentle meandering path in her story as we vicariously enjoy the sexual awakening of Anna .... yummie .... yummie .. yummie ....  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-07

Emma Holly grabs the reader by the throat from the first pages as we find our young and naive heroine, Audrey, dump her friend in Miami during a vacatiion and move into the mansion of a much older, man of the world, wealthy, of course, banker. The fact that she entered the world of becoming a sex slave in training didn't really bother her at the beginning, but after a few weeks of this exploration, and abuse,  she decided to escape and maybe think this whole thing over.       Feeling safe to be back with her friend she plays some wonderfull 'I'll show you mine if you show me yours' games that are so crisply written that the temperature in the room must have risen by like 10 degrees. Anyway, little Audrey didn't get away as we soon learn that our older banker friend and pervert, not only had a tracker on her but started to pull in favours with his wide web of powerfull friends  to 'keep an eye' on Audrey and continue her training.       It's at this point we meet Patrick Dugan, the son of a prominent politico and a cast of characters including a drag queen singer who works at the local bar owned by Patrick. The little games played our cast of characters and the intrigue of our Miami banker friend not wanting to loose a yummie morsel like Audrey is what makes this a great book.       I have noted some reviewers making comments about the proclivity of Audrey to be a little free with her favours .... I don't know just because on her first day of work as a waitress at Dugans bar she does a serious lap dance on the drag queen singer in his dressing room, finally does the 'dirty' with Tommy her 'friend' shes been teasing for ten years, at his apartment, is forced to start her slave training and 'lick' spilled beer off the 'pants' of Patrick her new boss, at his apartment, and then 'really' pleasures herself with a vibrator that has suction cups and can be stuck on the wall ... that doen't really make her a nympho though, does it?      I believe that Emma Holly made the story the central theme of this book since it's really hard to fixate or place any kind of real attachement, as the reader, to any of these characters individually. But just take a young beutifull nympho that likes it rough, mix in an old wealthy banker perv, a young 'hot to trot self conscious boyfriend, a bar lizzard drag queen, the son of a prominent politico and you vertainly have the makings of a wonderfully erotic sexual cocktail .... no pun intended ...	2005-02-16

OK .. as if getting a new set of cast iron pots and pans as a 20th wedding anniversary present wasn't bad enough, the fact that Julia's husband, Micheal is fast asleep after the celebration really made her think. The new lingerie she bought for that special night, unnoticed, and her husband dancing with the young secretary that he had an affair with a year ago certainly didn't help Julia's confidence either .. so what to do ....       One of her girlfriend's upcoming marriage gave Julia just the excuse she needed to get out for a night 'with the girls' to just plain 'let her hair down' among other little things. The inordinate attention of a man young enough to be her son, and catching the bride to be doing some pretty sweet and 'nasty' little things was enough of an excuse for our heroine to start 'partying' on her own.       Being an 'older' woman who has remained faithfull to her marriage, Julia had no 'little nagging' problems with her conscience as she was taken to the young mans's apartment where she could slowly, gently and teasingly take him through the paces. The few hours alone, in the dark brought back delicious memories of feelings and emotions that for much too long had gone unappreciated ..... something that our heroine was going to correct from that point on!      The author's erotica writing skills are astounding when compared to much of the erotica hitting the books today. She manages to describe the seduction by Julia and such a detailed and delicious way that the reader can not only literally feel the heat but pretty well enjoy a vicarious exprience as if we were there ...       This is a Hot Hot Hot book and I consider it a must have to be re-read over and over .....	2005-02-14

We meet our heroine, Kirsty, as a young girl in England exploring her sexuality, deliciously I might add, with a rather normal and family minded boyfriend, Dave, and then she discovers something 'new' with her best friend, Sharon.... This intro of 60 something pages is actually worth the price of admission alone ....       Anyway, back to the novel ... Kirsty gets a letter from a man named Jack who lives in, of couse, a villa on a Greek island, and, he says that he is Kirsty's uncle (from dead fathers' side)  He desperately wants to meet her to get to know more of his long lost family. Jack send her an airline ticket and then says that if she wants, bring a friend .... Although she never asked Dave, he thought it was a very bad idea, but Sharon, of course, signs on, but, because she can't get a ticket she'll follow on another flight.       Having read most of this author's other works the reader must surely realize that all is not what it seems and this 'uncle' Jack now has a 'captive young girl' to do with as he, and his friends please... and .. that he certainly does. No matter how much Kirsty tries to convince herself, at the beginning, this is not really a family vacation but rather she is a captive being raped and sexually abused, misused, threatened and punished. Problem is that although she makes every effort to escape, the sexual antics on the island are beginning to have a markedly pleasurable effect on her .... Oh where is Sharon or her boyfriend to rescue her?       The plot thickens but Im not going to spoil it here ...       One imortant note, the antics on the island get pretty base, and by that I mean extreme including antics with a horsie named 'Mighty',  so like I said I think this book will certainly be for the reader that enjoys their erotica hard, heavy and varied ... trust me varied ... do not expect much of the flowers, chocolate and date kind of sweetness here .... but if you are up to it ...	2005-02-13

But Gordon does keep the reders interest as the two Phillips trick her into believing that she injured the nasty Belinda and to avoid the police getting involved she must stay  ...   <br /> <br /> <br />The good thing is that Hayley does accept the hedonistic practices of her employers and towards the end of the bokk really gets into it ... or maybe it's the other way around ... oh well you know what I mean .... <br /> <br /> <br />Neat little book .... no literary masterpiece but enjoyable ...	2005-02-11

Why, well Levine points out that the famous nine fall victim to the sin of pride and become concerned with their historical legacy, and, since most history writers, most doing doctorate work at decidedly liberal universities are themselves liberal ... voila' ... if you want a legacy to be written about and admired, you better seriously consider a change while on the bench ......  <br /> <br /> <br />Because of the great respect I have always had for the Supreme Court, living Florida you can imagine my thoughts about the court here, I never much though about 'agendas' or 'activist' judges and just gave them the benefit of the doubt.Certainly the 9th circuit court over on  the 'left' coast is an ACTIVIST court, with more than a capital A, and, I could never really figure out why the Supreme Court never really took them to the woodshed with some of their crazy crazy rulings usually totally out of line with the obvious wishes electorate. Well, Levine's book has certainly opened my eyes to look on the Supreme Court with much more analytical and critical viewpoint in the future ... maybe the judges were'nt as completely honest with the American public as they should have been when they got confirmed ... can that be? <br /> <br /> <br />The older I get the more I realize how little I know and it's books like this that are giving me an education I should have looked for, no, actually demanded,  a long time ago ....

WOW what an interesting piece of work ... I was a little put off by the title at first blush and got the same feeling as if someone said 'hey you mother wears Army boots' but, right from the first pages I realized that this author has managed to take an analytical look at the holy writings of Judeaism, Christianity and explained the folly and contradictions in terms that a even moron like I could understand.....  <br /> <br /> <br />Unfortunately however, once we hit the section on Islam, on page 125, the book falls appart. After the hard cutting and intellectual analysis of the Bible the author 'Nosrep' looses his objectivity completely and the writings becomes pure fluff, shallow, self serving once we hit the Islam and the Qur'an section for 30 final pages Of the very little that we know about the author he says that he grew up in one of the three major religions and, based on his teatment of Islam in this book it's absolutely not a stretch to belive this is the religion he grew up with...  <br /> <br /> <br />The book is divided into three sections, Judaeism, Christianity and Islam. In each section the author takes the words of the Bible and examines how the burning religious questions such as ... Was Mary really a virgin .. Was Jesus really the son of God .. Who were the forefathers of Jesus .. What were/are the Judaeic Laws .. Where did the Jews come from .. Whrote the Old and New Testaments .. really really quite good works ...  <br /> <br /> <br />It wasn't till I hit the section on Islam that I felt completely let down as the authors clear cut analytical style began to crumble like a deck of cards, and, the words 'hidden agenda seemed to neon flash in my mind. His last chapter kind of tell the story where the reader is told that.....  <br /> <br /> <br />..... 'Christianity is filled with a long record of supression of scientific and literary advancement due to conflicts between the Church and the literary and scientific research. Indeed, Christianity is unquestionably one of the main restrictors of scientific investigation and freedom of speech troughout world history' .....  <br /> <br /> <br />WOW ... OK that covers the dark ages .... but .... hey what about the 19th century till today .... lasers, the computer, the internet, 747's, cellphones., HDTV .... Then, so as not to leave that little statement just hanging there the author does state .... <br /> <br /> <br />Continuing 'Nosrep' writes 'Of course, Islam also has had a long history of hindering the advancement of science and literature as well.' ....  <br /> <br /> <br />WOW ... you're kidding ... right ....  <br /> <br /> <br />Now for the author ... why didn't you sign the book as 'Anonymous' instead of playing with the reader with a name that just happens to more or less write 'Objective Person' backwards ... cute ... but it takes away from the book ....  <br /> <br /> <br />All of that notwithstanding the authors clear cut and crystal thinking returns in the conclusions.

The author had to use a lot of creativity in these recepies since in being able to present a dish that not only looks tasteful but also is considered as a main dish for the vegetarians in your crowd. There are some pastry and filo dough items that are quite unique .....  <br /> <br /> <br />The presentation of this book as well is fabulous. ALL and I mean ALL the recepies take up only one page, each page has a presentation picture, and, for any slightly more complicated recepies small thumbnails showing the prep steps. In colour of course ..... Also, each recepie gives a carb, calorie, sugar etc breakdown, an estimated time for completion of the dish and a small graphic as to how many steps are required to prepare the dish .... The instrcutions are clear cut and concise ...  <br /> <br /> <br />Since this is an 'international' edition of, I guess, a USA book the recepies are very very varied and include dishes from both the Far and Middle East, from Thailand, Latin America etc etc .....

What an excellent book, and, as an added bonus, it's also a very easy read of a pretty tough topic. It's also easy to understand the great temptation for readers/reviewers in this forum to take Harris work and twist it as a criticism of president Bush and his strong Christian faith, but, I think that they sorely missed the point.       In the end I believe that the author wants us to become critical thinkers, not judgemental, about the role of Faith religion ... etc in our lives.... And that he most certainly does with a clear cut, concise and surgical manner. It hardly takes a nuclear engineer to come to the conclusion that most of the wars that have been fought since man strutted out of a cave have been a direct or indirect result of religious beliefs, but what makes this book interesting is the position of the author that many 'modern' wars have not ended in decisive battles, like the Aztecs, where the winning army ate the loosing army, but rather ended in a truce whereby the war may have ended but the hate continues to fester, grow and strengthen! I guess it's just like an infection, unless you kill it, it will probably return stronger and stronger and returns impervious to antibiotics that may have done the job from day one ...       Harris bring home the point, frightenly so, that today, with the advent of nuclear, biogical and what have you weapons, a very few people can in effect bomb or infect mankind back into caves, and it will be our foolish and unquestioning 'Christian' ethics that will allow this to happen! Silly enough, if anything, Harris is proposing that rather than a Christian President Bush what we really need today is Ghengis Kahn if we are going to have any hope of a long term future for mankind.      After reading this book you won't ever ask where are those WMD but rather you'll ask 'right or wrong' is this really the end of the war, am I risking my family's life in giving the enemy the 'benefit of the doubt'.... is our blind faith going to the END of REASON??? The author doesn't tell us to loose our faith but rather just says ... OK let's talk about that elephant in the room .. OK ...

Too bad cause I think this is one of the very few Emma Holly books that I give anything less than 5 stars .....  <br /> <br /> <br />First of all the story is a fantasy, highly unlikely in the real world. One of the authors strenghts in her other books is to take real people in real situations and spin extraordinary erotic tales. In Strange Attlractions we have a young woman,  Charity Wills, accepting a contract to become a sexual experiment for BG Grantham (Bill Gates type of super wealthy nuclear physicist) and his man Friday, Erik Berne (super good looking male model type). In return she gets her Harvard style nuclear etc etc degree fully paid for by BG.  <br /> <br /> <br />You get the picture.... well the book totally falls appart from the get go. When Erik appears at the place where poor little Charity is working as a lowly clerk, she immediately strat on 'I'm not that kind of girl' thing and I have slapped previous men who make degrading offers ... fine and good .... only thing is that a few pages later she's not only sitting in BG's Rolls with Erik on the way to the campus/home of BG, but, they just happen to stop along the way when Charity screams stop the car \\"I want this man to take me, and I'm not going any farther until he does\\"! So, on page 56 the driver just does that and of course takes Charity while BG is watching through a minature camera that was installed in the limo....  <br /> <br /> <br />Enough of Charity's character development ...  <br /> <br /> <br />OK so now to BG and Erik ... well the relationship is very sexual and if you like books that describe men getting it on together .. well then you'll rate this one as five stars .... for me, I found the scenes of these two sexual olympians to be a complete turn off, contrived, shallow, and just plain dumb ... <br /> <br /> <br />Certainly not Emma Holly type erotica this book is more like wealthy people in cheap porn ...... <br />	2004-12-28

Victorian erotica genearlly should have a darker hidden side, illictit sex, hidden behind closed doors and on the sly, also there is usually some elemnts of seduction, pursuit, capture and surrender...  <br /> <br /> <br />Well this book has little of any of that because Jenny and her friends generally at going at it hot and heavy after only meeting for a few minutes .....  <br /> <br /> <br />There are a series of these books and I can;t see them being worth it .... sorry .....	2004-10-12

If you enjoyed the above book then you will most certainly want to read this this one.  <br /> <br /> <br />Both books have the same flowery verse as we follow the life of a flea from Britain to rural France while the little gnat recounts his experiences living and suckling on the bodies of young nubile unwitting humans.  <br />	2004-10-11

I have the Carroll & Graf edition that has a picture of a young ballerina's legs on the cover, and, the picture alone rates five stars and is worth the price of the book ...  <br /> <br /> <br />The book is writtten in two parts by the main character Pauline and is written as a series of letters to her friend and confidante as she recounts her travels in Europe and her sexual education. The first half of the book is exquisite as the author takes us across Europe, while Pauline finishes her education and meets different eminent members of each society. <br /> <br /> <br />Pauline, in the second half of the book gives the reader warning that her letters will not be the same since she now was more mature and more attuned to be able to control her body. Certainly correct since we now see our herione trying to cope with the frustarrtions of conformity and more difficult access to discrete sexual parters ... <br /> <br /> <br />Great book... well written and certainly a classic to be enjoyed several times ..	2004-10-11

This young aunt then send Roger the money to hop on a bus and visit with her to see if he would enjoy 'life on the outside'.  <br /> <br /> <br />Needless to say his first experinces with real life began on the bus trip and when he got to New Orleans, well, his REAL education was just beginning. Aunty Rachel sure knows what makes men and women tick and live a life that certainly included all pleaures of the flesh.	2004-10-11

One can only hope that this wonderfull novel will soon re-print. <br /> <br /> <br />Although set in the late 19th century, just before the age of Victorian erotica, this book certainly has the same steamy hot erotic lust of the genre. A young English lord travels to France to witness the formation of the Republic and the violence of the French revolution. He makes friends with the right people and is able to participate in the wild debauch of a country and it's peole in turmoil. <br /> <br /> <br />Our hero manages to meet many aritocrats of his time, including the Marquis de Sade, and enthusiastically shares some of the sweet sexual delights being offered to young men of means.  <br /> <br /> <br />Finally, political things being too hot our hero returns to Britain and there, continuing his hedonistic seach, he manages to discover new and varied erotic pastimes msuch  as ..... occult, demonology, vampires and all those little goodies that were certainly prevelant at that age.  <br /> <br /> <br />The author spins a fabulous tale of the current political and social happenings of the day in each of the chapters and then usually it ends with a delicious romp in the hay .....

Jennifer is an absolute golden girl that is like walking eye candy wherever she goes, and, she takes on an assignment to do a photo shoot and reveling article of the six hottest six men in the world for one of the hottest magazines. <br /> <br /> <br />Ok so it doesn't exactly have an extensive plot as Jennifer hops from bed to bed but, all in all, these books are just viginettes of romantic/erotic trysts and expericiences anyway ....

This Victorian erotica book has been published and re-published by Red Stripe, Carroll and Graf ... etc ... and I would imagine should hit the shelves again  .....  <br /> <br /> <br />In typical Victorian manner this is a life story account of Frank Meridith who, OF COURSE, is a man of totally independent means, has decided to while away his life as an English Classics professor and private tutor. The author spends over 100 pages of the 158 page book recounting his experience at the home of Cynthia Dartman, a voluptuos widow living with a saucy Maid Lucy, and two young delinquent daughters ...  <br /> <br /> <br />At the suggestion of his respected professor a young Frank is basically blackmailed by the wily Mrs Datrman to take the job of a ttor and also, here's the yummie part, disciplinarian of the household.  <br /> <br /> <br />What I really like about this book is that the author writes the story of the spankings being more an erotic foreplay to normal sexual liasons rather than the 'razon de'tre' of the story. Some erotic spanking novels published today are nothng but S&M volumes that only dedicate themselves to, ususally, young girls getting the living daylights beat out of them.  <br /> <br /> <br />Although they do have their purpose in erotica they certainly aren't the kinds of books that I personally enjoy.  <br /> <br /> <br />This is one of the better novels written, and even thought I thought the best part was Franks experience with Lucy and Mrs Dartman I do recommend it highly as a certain Victorian classic .....	2004-09-27

A young thityish Elizabeth Renard gives us an autobiographical tour of her 'hip' and sexual life style. No there is no real exploration of her sexuality it's that Elizabeth knows what she wants, and likes, while seeming to have no anxiety problems with the fact that maybe, just maybe, the men she hooks up with may not be for great material for long term relationships, till she hooks up with Dan that is .....  <br /> <br /> <br />It is certainly true that Elizabeth has real trouble with the whole issue of 'love' and in trying to keep her men on that unquestioning pedestal that is pretty well a requisite for 'long term' relationships....  <br /> <br /> <br />Although credited as 'Anonymous' the book I believe is a James Jennings novel and certainly one can see his erotic mastery in this book. Even though we do get to live, vicariously, Elizabeths hot and heavy sexual meanderings, I believe the author does certainly tone down some of the sexual heat to place the emphasis on her and her total thought process ....

The best known and devoured novels of course are; Venus School Mistress, Man with a Maid, A Weekend Visit, The Romance of Lust, Parsian Frolics, Two Flappers in Paris, School Life in Paris, and, My Secret Life. Actually, I certainly was quite pleasantly surprised to find that of this wonderfull collection I had read only eight of the thirty four .......<br /><br />Since the joy of erotica is not only in the incredible variety but also in the mind of the reader you will of course find excerpts that are not to be to your particular taste, but, the great thing is that you will also find some of the stories are absolutely yummie and send you on a quest to find the full book at any cost .... Appart from the timeless classical gems listed above this book has at least ten excerpts that would warrant their own five star reviews and are each, in my mind, worth the price of this book alone.<br /><br />'The Prodigal Virgin', is a story of an afternoon on a secluded beach where a young Marion is slowly and gently seduced by her new brother-in-law, Stanley. The unknown author of this book is an absolute master and paints a veritable fresco in the readers mind ....<br /><br />'Norah' is a story within a story of a young girl in a convent being induced into sins of the flesh by the chaplain and the mother superior. These stories are of course part of the Victorian classic fare where young, innocent and helpless young people are forced to accept and embrace their more carnal desires ....<br /><br />In 'Fobidden Fruit' a very short three page excerpt details the introduction of a young Percy in the gentle arms of his step-mother, a topic considered quite tittilating in Victorian days ...<br /><br />In 'Amy Denmead's History', and in several other stories in this book we see a young Amy learning the secrets of her body with the anxious assitance of Florence, one of her very close and 'special' friends ...<br /><br />I can't really review all the great pieces that I liked in this book but suffice it to say I enjoyed it and have already placed orders for some of the full volumes that have been excerted here .....	2004-09-18

It is that skill that allows the reader to vicariously enjoy the freewheeling trysts of Ariane and her two lovers ..... More than being light fare, the author manages, I guess, to calm her yearning to write a cookbook and treats us to 26 different recepies of proabably the most popular Cuban dishes around.

Her young charge is certainly not young but rather the mistress of the house Lady Wulvedon. The fact that she was restricted to her windowless room and only let out for lessons with the Lady of the house seemed not to really bother Isabelle as she managed to accept her position in the house immediatley...  <br /> <br /> <br />The castle, run by the lady and her brother is basically a sensual playgroung of hedonistic and pretty licentuous goings on as brother and sister compete for the affections of the residents. The FABULOUS thing about this book that places it heads above other dom/discipline novels is that Isabelle actually has more than a soft body but actually a very agile brain .... WOW ... and this is the magic ingrdient to take us out of porn into delicious fileds of pure erotica ....  <br /> <br /> <br />You'll finish this book in one sitting just like I did ... make sure you start it when you have a few leisure solitary hours ....	2004-08-27

WOW ... you can't imagine how many books one has to read in this genre before a gem is found that actually has an interesting story well written with superb character development and real life erotica that does not entail the women getting the living daylights beaten out of her ..... <br />This novel deals with a young girl, Carla, during the Italian renaissance finding family life untenable afer being pleasantly seduced by her older cousin, Stefano. Unable to endure the shame she disguses herfelf as a young man, since women alone would really not fare well in the streets, and makes her way in the world. <br />Carla changeds her name to Carlo and is immediately taken in by a master painter, Piero, who was a Guild member (Artist union). During this time only Guild members were allowed to sell  their paintings while younger artists had to content themselves with apprenticeship positions relegated to the painstaking tasks of mixing and preparing paints for the master. <br />Carla managed to keep her identity secret even though she began to like another apprentice, Marco, who was also working for his Guild licence. <br />Of course without giving away the story, the novel is solid and holds together, with Carla trying to live her life as a man while yearning for pleasures of the flesh as a woman. It's very easy for the reader to identify with Carla's plight and the frustration of the girl trying to live through the rules and norms of the renaissance society are very very palpable ... <br />The author spends considerable time with the exciting life story of Carla while keeping sexual tension and erotic interludes in the forefront ....	2004-06-28

For this review ... trust me little Clarissa's no wall flower. <br />Even worse ... maybe half an hour after her first meet with Nick shes bent over the 'bonnet' of her car on the main thoroughfare of the university town doing what even would make the most debased stripper flinch .... maybe not flinch but you get the message .....<br />Although the sex scenes are very very hot they are only that a series of viginette sex scenes ... what the book lacks is any kind of pursuit .. capture ... and ultimate sweet submission which is what I believe all great erotic lit should contain .....	2004-06-21

The trap is a secret letter to the king and royalist support by her father for the return of the king. <br />With this as a backdrop we now follow Lucinda though the back door into the hidden lives of perversion and debauchery of the Puritans and the clergy. Lucinda unfortunaletly may be able to fight the Puritans on a philosophical level but the betrayal of her body to the lusts and punishment of these perverts certainly does make it hard for her to show her 'displeasure'. <br />Oddly enough, when Lucina's true love, Charles returns from the war he is a changed man and worse than her Purtitan pervert husband ever was ... <br />To watch Lucinda deal with the trials and tribulations of the men around her was truly wonderfull ... this is a book I enjoyed thoroughly ...	2004-05-18

Lucrecia had two brothers, the cruel and captivating Cesare and the youngest, and favorite of everyone, Giovanni.<br />When Cesare caught Lucrecia and Giovanni in bed it was easy work for cesare to have the youngest brother killed by a gang of thughs the very next morning .... <br />The seduction scenes are so well written the reader almost vicariously feels like a participant.<br />Vol 2 - As well a full length book deals primarily with <BR>the escapades of Cesare and his battles both in and out of the bed as he raped and pillaged his way across Italy during the, I believe Rennaisnace period. <br />During his escapades he captures a citadel under the absolute control of a very cruel unapproachable, supposedly fridgid  countess.

I can't belive it .... this 1996 erotic novel released in 2003 as a Blue Moon edition and it's already out of print .... <br />If you are looking for pretty well straight sex in a contemporary erotic novel then this is IT.... A young Sue Millington,  was shocked to find her husband of three years  unceremoniously dump her for her closest friend... HMMMM gotta keep your eyes on those friends ....  I mean the sex with her husband Jim was super super and poor little Sue hadn't even suspected that Jim was having dinner AND desert at more than one table....<br />Almost immediately the story does take a great twist. Instead of eating chocolate ice cream for weeks and weeks, Sue decides to just plain take revenge on the institution of marriage and pretty well any husband that comes within her reach. That sure cures the condecending looks she got from her female friends and neighbours .......<br />Needless to say any girl that finds herself in that position may be tempted to do the same thing as Sue, but be forewarned she not only has to let any and all semblance of conscience leave her body completetly but she has some very 'heavy lifting' to do as she seduces each and every married man and, well now why stop there, seduce a few of her married female friends  as well ....<br />Page for page there are more couplings in this book than a two mile long freight train .... I loved it .... The story is great, and, although the reader knows what is happening it did keep my interest to the end of the book .. that, in itself, I thought, was amazing. Fair warning though for those readers that like a more intelectual erotica .. this book may have a lot of heavy breathing but is not heavy reading, thats for sure!	2003-11-25

You can imagine my disappointment the minute I read the first page that hey the main characters are a young girl Clara and a detective Garnett .....<br />The story deals with our heroine hiring Garnett to find her sister Rita who mysteriously disappears. The virginal Clara does find Rita's diary and brings it to give the detectice clues that the missing sister has probably fallen into some kind of devil worshipping cult on the West coast . <br />Garnett convinces our young heroine that it would be best if they work together on the case to find the sister, but, since these cults have many sexual ceremonies will she be up to the dangerous task ahead of her. I can ssure you Garnett was certainly 'up to the task' ... <br />In the vein of great erotica we see Clara slowly and inexorable drawn towards a path of total submission and surrender with some very very sexually mature and agressive people ....<br />BTW check out the Seduced book and if it's available you'll get this and another super full erotic novel 'Roman Orgy' for the price of one .....	2003-11-22

In this book we have the live in governess Miss Martin reach an agreement with the lord of the manor, Easton Sherwood, to seduce prettty well all the women living at the mansion and the neighbours as well. Our lecherous Easton of course jumps at this proposal as a means having 'access' to his niece and daughter. <br />The fly in the ointment appears almost imediately when Easton's wife, Letita, makes exactly the same proposal on the condition that Easton immediately fire Miss Martin and force her out of the house and out of a job...... <br />The those that enjoy Victorian erotica this is certainly a great book and of course well enough written to maintain your interest in the story .....	2003-11-22

The seduction, of course, is a foregone conclusion since Selina knows how to make any man's blood boil, what wasn't in the plans though was the unexpected arrival of Gervaise, the long lost brother of Selinas mother who has come to relocate in Britain. What also wasn't in her plans was that street smart Gervaise could smell a rat before he even stepped over the threshold, and, he decides to have some of Selinas sweet offerings as well ... <br />Course everything about the bearded uncle is repulsive to Selina ... and ... well that's the spice of the story .... <br />Typical for the twisted Black Lace type of novel we have a determined strong willed woman who has no fear of doing what when and where she wants even it it ends up having sex with a disgusting uncle as well..... <br />This is fabulous contemporary erotica ...	2003-11-22

The pursuit, capture and ultimate surrender viginettes are somewhat short for some of our player but just as juicy nonetheless..... <br />The author manages to take us along a twisty plot that the reader must pay attention to if he/she wants to really enjoy the story. Bella on the other hand, our heroine doesn't have to pay attention at all since, even though she thinks she is the master of her destiny, is actually taken for a ride by Vaughn and Lucerne. And what a ride it is once she discovers that the two boys don't really need a woman to have their own fun ..... <br />Is it the ultimate turn on for a woman to compete for her lover with another man? What if that lover is so hot she can't her hands off him either? Well at least they have a common ground to begin a relationship ...

At his hotel the captain meets Lizzie the wife of one of his fellow officers. Captain Deveraux and Lizzie develop more than a relationship, hmmmmm, and Lizzie then describes how she was seduced at the age of thirteen by another soldier Captain Vincent in Britain .... <br />The second volume deals with the esteemed captain travelling to the hinterlands where he meets the Selwyn family, his commanding officer, his wife and two very young daughters Amy and Fanny .... <br />The fact that there were few eligible British men around certainly temped our esteemed Captain Deveraux and tru to the erotic nature of the book he does succumb .. actually over and over .. <br />This is an EXCEPTIONAL book in that there IS a story, there is character development to some degree and an account of a very believable lifestyle of British officers in their occupation of the Indian subcontinent.

The reader practically squeams in anguish as we see the young Sinhue sell anything and everything, including his own parents burial tomb in order to spend even one night alone with this girl. To say that things go badly would be an understatement and so we see our hero forced to flee his homeland in search for knowledge ....<br />The interesting thing about this book is that we get to see the times through the eyes of a commoner rather than thruogh the eyes of the more obvious royalty of Cleopatra, King Tut or Nefertiti ..... As a reader I did find the story frustrating in that one would almost want to scream out ... no no no no you idiot, can't you see that you are being used .... but I guess thats the whole point of reading a book that allows the reader to get involved ....	2003-10-28

WOW ... even though we may all have fallen into the pit of deep frying wings and buying buffalo wing sauces at the local Piggely Wiggely .... this book will blow out all of your chicken wing pre-conceptions .... <br />There are suaerbraten wing recepies, hoisin sauce recepies, sour cream recepies and so on and so forth, all of them exquisite, and a taste sensation. The recepies are very varied in the basic prep of the wings and most do not take that many steps. There are a multitude of flavours to choose from ranging from the dark sweet brown sugar glazed wings to spicy Eastern wings made with chutney or hoisin sauce to tangy sour European style wings. <br />The 'Desert Fox Wing' recepie (page 79) for example, uses orange juice, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, lemon and orange zest, rosemary, thyme, oregano, cardamon, cumin,tumeric and of course salt in the preparation of the marinade .... WOW .... how many chickens did they have to kill just to get that list of ingredients ..... <br />The book has a few B&W pictures on how to prep the wings but they have no pictures of dish presentation... I can understand that since all you really need is just a roll of paper towells and a beer ... Some of the recepies have a history or a restaurant tied to them and some, I guess, are just from the author.... The book is 203 pages long and I would estimate then that it must have well over 130 recipies <br />Like I said ... don't expect this book to be picked up on the cheap but do RUN and buy a copy ..... then call me and invite me over for wings and a beer ...

The first book that I read by this author was 'Naked Lies' and I gave it a very generous single star ..... The reason that I was really turned off by that book was that it primarily dealt with a pretty dumb dumb dumb nympho ..... <br />Well, I bought 'Schoolgirl Lust' since the author is prolific and numerous of his books have been published and re-released so he must definitely have a following. Well, it shouldn't be any surprise to me that this book also deals with a pretty dumb and gullible 16 year old young girl, Charlotte, living in a UK village with her mother. The book starts with Charlotte, living a very repressed puritanical life, begining to wonder about those 'wet' dreams and strange feelings that seem to be creeping into her mind and body ..... When confiding these feelings to a friend from school, Emily, our heroine is introduced to the delights of Lesbos, and, trust me, Charlotte never looked back. <br />Similar to 'Naked Lies' our little heroine is quicky tied into a web of intrigue and deception by the local store owner and priest forcing her to become the subject of some pretty wild. and I mean over the top wild, orgies and debauchery .... What amazed me is the absolute stupid reaoning that these old pervs and lechers used on our heroine for her to take her clothes off for the 'private' and 'special ' photo shoots .... <br />So I gave the book 5 stars because maybe the ridiculously dumb stories that Charlotte was subjected to actually would work in real life on an innocent .... I mean after all she lived in a pretty limited and very sheltered environment .... The first half of the book is well written and pracvtically worth the price of the book alone ... the second half of the book is OK but I mean after Charlotte gives in to the 'dark side' the reader knows what to expect taking some of the erotica edge off the story .... <br />Had the author continued his style and story through the second half of the book I would probably have given it 10 stars.... There must be readers that love this total 'down and dirty' submission book because 'Naked Lies' is out of print and used copies are going for three digit prices ...

There are bright and colourfulrr pictures on al the pages, and the three column layout makes it a very very easy read. <br />Discussions about dating, friendship, sex, peer pressure and all those things important to a teen girl are interspersed with sidebars and always explained with the bible and deep religious sprituality as the main theme .... <br />One thing that did really bother me about this book is that it was probably written by some pretty militant Christian female protagonists .... For example, on page 188 in a 'Bible Bios: Hagar' the authors present Hagar as Sarah's slave girl and since Sarah was barren she convinced Abraham to 'sleep' with her and eventually take her as his wife. The bio continues that Sarah became jealous of Hagar and the son, Ismael, that she bore with Abraham causing Hagar to run away into the desert where where an angel told Hagar that her son would be a 'wild man that would bring conflict against all men'. Considering that Sarah became pregnant at a very very old age through divine intervention, and that Sarah had the 'whore' Hagar thrown out of her house now that she bore Abraham a son, I found this 'hard line' Christian interpretation to be a disappointing .... It would have been a much more opportune to dicusss jealousy, family unity and the father's responsiblitly to his son much more appros pos ...... <br />OK is this supposed to pull the wool over the young readers mind? Those ofyou that believe that are so far gone that you are going to need much more than this version of the New Testament to land on earth .....Quite simply, this is an excellent modern vesrion of the Nerw Testament that is fun to read without dealing with pages and pages of travelogues to long gone places and unending 'begats' .....	2003-09-09

Having read and thoroughly enjoyed the original 'Sugar Busters' book, on the instructions from my cardio vascular doctor, I found the recepies quite interesting and bought this book for that primary reason .... <br />Everyone that I know has one or another 'famous' diet for me to try but I have to admit that most diets follow some 'theme' and are not what I would call all-inclusive and do not really take advantage of the chemical processes inside our bodies as we digest our sugar laden diets ....<br />The book starts with a primer of the Sugar Busters diet and listings of foods and spices that are recommended and which ones we should stay away from. <br />The second main section of the book deals with detailed recepies. I have tried many of the recepies in the book and find the easy to prepare and definitely very tasty ... Excellent bean dishes and seafood dishes of course with some even from the unbelieveable kitchens of K-Paul (Paul Prudhome in New Orleans) <br />The drawbacks of this book are one; it's certainly on the expensive side for a spiral bound book, and two; it has no .. i mean none, zippo, zilch .... pictures of any of the prepared dishes, certainly a drwaback to even the most humble of cookbooks that I have in my library..... <br />Am I happy to have bought this book, yes, does it replace the original Sugar Busters book in explaining the diet, no .... certainly I would suggest that you read the full diet book first to completely understand the whole concept ......	2003-08-13

It's not really erotica in any sense but rather a sexual kink fantasy .... that's for sure ..... and in keeping with that genre it certainly rates 5 stars .....	2003-08-12

Where in the world were women like Claudia a few years back when I was young? <br />Portia da Costa has done it again with an erotic account that veritably sizzles as the pages are turned. Claudia, recently widowed, comes upon a young man skinny dipping in the creek of her English countryside estate.  Rather than throw him off her property she finds it much more exciting just  enjoying the view as he enjoys the solidtude and flexes his muscle.... LOL<br />Of course a late night thunderstorm finds the stranger on Claudia's doorstep where he passes out from fear, confusion, and of course we later find, amnesia. Yummie or what .... 'Come in said the spider to the fly' comes to mind as Caudia takes him in and lets the poor boy rest to recover his energy. Needless to say Claudia has a very very strange bedside manner if she wanted him to recover ... if you know what I mean ..<br />The author spins a tale that keeps our interest as the Claudia awakens to a new and hidden part of her sexual awareness that was very much so surpressed during her blissfull married life. The greatest thing is that this is now one of the few English erotica books that the characters are able to taste the fruits of the flesh without having to beat the living daylights out of each other first or even use kitchen utensils to get it on ..... <br />So it's also hardly a surprise that this 1997 Black Lace printing is 'sold out' and you can bet Im not selling my copy either ......	2003-08-02

The plot thickens when we meet Margaret the submissive secretary/slave lover of Ruby's recently deceased father, and of course Rick Martell, the handsome, dashing Malaisian peer of Ruby's in his own corporation. Both Ruby and Rick are competitors in a proffer to purchase a large Malaisian computer chip foundry. <br />The book actually was super hot and erotic until we get to the middle of the book when all the main players end up in Rick's California mansion for a week of trying to convince the owner of the Malasian plant that their deal is the best. We get a kind of disconnect at that point, and the loss of one star, as the characters undergo a complete transformation with slaves turning into dommes overnight. It don't happen in real life.... I guess .....

Certainy sections of the book that practically describe what a knife or a wooden spoon is are over the top, trust me I don't think that this book is meant for people that are not wholly and totally comfortable in the kitchen ... the fact that as a cookbook there are no pictures to show meal presentation is a total bummer for me that's for sure ... <br />OK so this is not the kind of book that you want to read from cover to cover as the plot thickens, or should I say the sauce thickens .... but ... there are sections that make it worth the price alone ... <br />First .. chapter one and two that expalin the concept and process of the diet is very good and if you tie it in with your general knowledge of outher diet plans such of the 'Sugar Busters Diet' it is excellent ... <br />Then chapetr 3 is filler telling you that you'll need spoons and pots to be able to cook <br />Chapter four is absolutely fabulous since it describes the impotance and historically forgotten banefits of most of the important herbs and spices in your kitchen... I have a copy of that section right beside my spice rack as we speak ... <br />Lastly, the recepies, the reader should be very discerning and pick the one's that would be appealing and necesary... How to make sugar free catsup is super ... hot chocolate and even dishes using cardamon seeds are great   ... <br />The book is a little pricy if you only buy it and put it on the shelf for some future project, but if you have the time and inclination to pick out what you want, well, then it's well worth it ....	2003-07-25

About a month ago, in an effort at preventitive medicine to lower my cholestorol and resulting high blood sugars, my GP sent me to a cardiovascular surgeon. Well as a person that rarely has gone to doctors I wasn't exactly excited what this guy told me, but, when I asked him to explain what kind of a diet or program I should follow he just said buy the book Sugar Busters and follow what it says ..... <br />I have been on all kinds of diets before (who hasn't) and every time some Doctor tried to explain to concepts to me they generally lasted only short periods since the darn diets just didn't make any sense, and it just felt like pieces were missing in the overall puzzle of chemistry in they body related to proteins, carbohydrates, sugars, chloesterol, good bad etc etc..... <br />What a great surprise this book was to me. Not only does it tie all the pieces together and explain its' diet as the  'Sugarbusters way of eating is roughly 40 percent carbohydrates 30 percent protein and 30 percent fat, it is a balanced diet'  that  makes overall sense..... <br />The authors go to great detail to explain the functions of the pancreas, the purposes of insulin, glucanol and exactly what happens when you eat a high protein meal vs a high cargohydrate meal.... <br />For example, the book explains that \\"The glycemic index (GI) is a measure of how much of a specific amount of ingested carbohydrate (usually 50 grams) will cause a persons blood sugar to rise and remain elevated over time relative to the effect on blood sugar of the same amount of pure glucose (which is assigned a GI of 100)... NOW HERE's THE SHOCKER FOR ME the book continues that to \\"compare the potatoes blood stimulating effect realtive to table sugar is that it would take 118 grams of sugar to have the same impact as one potato. That is 29 1/2 teaspoons of sugar ... WOW all that from one miserable white potato .... <br />From a historical perspective the book explains that sugar is not even mentioned in the bible and is a modern phenomena dating back only to 500 AD .... obviously the authors have the hots against processed sugars, flour, white potatoes, even white rice (surprising to me cause I thought that rice was a salvation for me .... WRONG) .... The authors also do something that I would have thought was ABSOLUTE BLASPHEMY and even HERECY in that they talk about the famous US goverment food pyramid, that even my dog knows by heart, and advise the reader the this pyramid was formed after many battles with the sugar lobby, the flour lobby, the potato lobby, meat people, egg people, milk people etc etc etc ... needless to say the resulting pyramid is more than suspect, for lack of using stronger words .......<br />Ok .. so you get the picture ... and as an added bonus this book contains som 100 pages of recepies from restaurants around the US that are in line with the Sugar Busters diet .... <br />This is one FABULOUS book that is well written, easy to understand, clear cut (don't really need a PhD in chemistry to understand it)and I feel is a definive answer to all those bits and pieces of diet information and stupid, misleading and politically correct food pyramids that I have been exposed to over my 'sugar eating' lifetime.....	2003-04-02

Comin in on the heels of 'The Confessional' the author manages to maintain his/her style in this newly released erotica work. <br />Our hero, a married man who had just undergone hypnosis to cure him of smoking decides that this technique should also work in convincing his 18 year old Greek housekeeper, Nikki,  that way down deep she wants to be his devoted pleasure slave. The fact that Mr. Davis, also known as sir and master in this book, is a friend of  Nikki's mother is not really dwelled upon buy the author except to increase the naughtiness of it all... <br />The author certianly likes the male father type figure, in a position of authority, using his powers of reaoning to gently, slowly and inexorable breaking down the targeted females' resistance to his prurient interests and passions. ST Drake is a master of these mind games ...... <br />Actually I was only going to give this book four stars when compared to her previous novel since the sex and eroticism seems a little canned .... in my mind certainly not as erotic ..... but... for those readers that love domination type fare it certainly would rate the 5 stars I gave it ... <br />There is some spanking, of course, but on the whole it's more of a mind game story that is very enjoyable ......	2003-03-31

Whereas edwardian erotica may be dark and brooding, Victorian makes no bones about pleasures of the flesh (did I really say that ...

Being a wealth young Englishman with no concers for his income he certainly is able to give hedonism a new name. <br />Volume 2 is a continuation of Ruperts education 'A Freshmans Tale 'with an enlarged group of friends that continue their education of the softer and yummie things in life.

As a matter of fact practically all the stories do entail a couple enticing another somewhat younger women into their erotic sexual escapades that start with a good ole British style spanking .... <br />Naturally all of the women in this book generally change their recalcitrant mood and attitude once the bare bottom slaps begin, and, what makes this book stand heads above the rest of the erotic spanking fare is the oh so sweet submission to sins of the flesh after the punishment has been endured ..... <br />I am sure that there are a lot of people that enjoy this light S&M ... and I believe that if they don't, well then, they should be thoroughly spanked ...

I would classify it on the Ho Hummm scale rather than WOW I gotta get this book now ..... <br />The book contains two novels and weighs in at 433 pages. The book was published in 1995 and generally these multi novel books by Caroll & Graf were selected for excellence in erotica ..... The editors of this 'Anonymous'tome must have been asleep ... <br />In the first book 'Confessions of an English Maid' we are provided with the account of a 12 year old Jessie and her stepbrother as they grow up together playing doctor and finishing with husband and wife .... When mom catches them in the act she is sent away to a reformatory school where she meets another young girl that was sent there from a house of prostitution .... It's of course no stretch of the imagination that the plot unfolds and we find Jessie working in the house and telling the reader of her encounters .... It's easy to read but now well done in my mind and only semi erotic... <br />The second novel has no title except 'Chapter One' we read about Louise ... who is known as Madeleine in France and her adventures as she runs away from home with Bob a much older lover to go to medical school ... This book only has two really hot scenes towards the end of the book when Louise catches her then husband with the maid 'Clementine' and later when she gets her revenge by seducing a young page but Tommy .... <br />If it wasn't for those two scenes of about 25 pages this book would have rated 1 star .....	2003-01-24

He doesn't paint a pretty picture of the Saudi beduin tribes because maybe there ain't no pretty picture to be painted .... <br />The book is a harsh story of life as a 'Palestinian' commencing in the early 1940's of a young Arab, Ishmael. Ishmael lived in a small settlemnt of Tabah located half way between Haifa and Jerusalem. Ishmael being one of the only people in the little enclave, under control of Haj Ibrahim, that learned to read and provides us with a blow by blow account of growing up in the middle of familial, political and religious turmoil and violence .... <br />It really is a wonderfull but sad story and the book gave me a much better understanding of life in the Middle East that I would ever get from any of the numerous talking heads on network and cable TV .....	2003-01-23

This book consists of a series of letters primarily between two cousins, Augustus and the Lady Maude discussing potential love and sexual conquest. It is definitely of a Victorian style inasmuch it contains considerable verbiage describing the scenery and their particular surroundings. As well there is considerable babble describing tight jeans and the thoughts that would cross a young mans mind as he watches a young girl bend over ....<br />But that's about it .... There appears to be no real depth in these characters nor in what I would consider simple witted thoughts. And, to make matters worse, we come upon the famous Noreen in a harem towards the end of the book ... Ah yes Noreen in a harem, HMMMM .... the author is `Anonymous' I should wouldn't doubt that the book was one of the first written by Jmaes Jennings .........<br />Trust me...

Needless to say, the apple does not fall far from the tree, the young Saturnin recounts his tales of sexual awakening and his entry into the monastery to live a life of debauchery .... Although I did read the book completely I can't really say was  memorable or even good.

So, if your are like moi, an afficionado of erotica the chances are <BR>excellent that you will have multiple copies of this authors' book ..... that may be the bad news, but, the good news is that her books are fabulous enough that you'll always have a copy nearby to read when you want to while away solitary moments. <br />This book has two full novels.... <BR>1) Palisir d'Amour 2) Joi d'Amour <br />In Plaisir the author takes us on a rollercoaster ride of 10 short stories with different characters, plots and settings. Each story of approximately 20 to 30 pages is so well written and so well developed that the reader does not feel cheated after finishing the story and demnding more. Each story has its own climax (so to say) and the characters are so well developed to make the tale viable. <br />The author very masterfully is able to tell a story without having to get into lengthly set-up before the story even begins. She does this by very deftly tying all the characters together as the sons, daughters, wives etc of a large well known and libidinous Parisienne family in the 1920's .... absolutely marvellous .... <br />To give you a flavour of the book, in the first story, Jeanne Takes A Lover' we find the young Christophe Brissard (some think this is the author's family) meeting the very married Jeanne Vernay (another well known Parisienne family) at a family dinner. Jeanne visits Christophe in his bedroom, after everyone went to bed, and our two lovers waste little time in tasting the fruits of the flesh. <br />Jeanne however keeps warning Christophe that during his lovemaking he takes her to heights she has never been before and she is very scared. Their secret encounters continue while Christphe and jeanne slowly teach each other to let loose their inhibitions. <br />In Joie d'Amour we find a similar number of scrumptios short stories. 'A Lesson for Bernard' we find a young Bernard Gaillard meeting a married Simone Lebrun at a Brissard family dinner. Since taking a lover is such a very very French thing to do Simone and Bernard eventually find themselves together in bed where Simone is more intersted in using her hands to make love to Bernard than other parts of her body. Although she gives in to Bernards requirment to complete the sex act, Simone simply explains to him that this does not give her the ultimate <BR>pleasure she yearns for, but, she would just rather play with him using her hands. The young Bernard is so disconcerted he seeks the advice of more learned friends to be able to reconcile Simones wants and wishes to his desire to continue the clandestine affair.... <br />Wonderfull works of erotic literature I WILDLY recommend ANY of Vellefranches books as being erotica that can be read over and over for years to come ... to date in my mind (and I've read a lot of erotica) no other author even comes close  ....	2002-11-23

For the life of me I do not understand where Blue Moon got the title since this book has NOTHING to do with the education of a maiden but is rather the coming of age story of young Charlie Roberts.... <br />What is even more disturbing is that this book is a 250 page, two chapter version of the much larger 'Romance of Lust' ..... so .... if you are an avid reader I am sure that you have already paid out the buck and read this story ....<br />I have seen erotica publishers do this before, some just taking a book called 'Katherin' then changing the name to 'Elizabeth' and republishing ... <br />I gave the 'Romance of Lust', a 5 star review <br />Quote <br />Hitting the scales at over 500 pages the connosoire of Victorian erotica will absolutely read every single page probably over and over again ...... This book, first published as four volumes, is now generally reprinted as one book with all four volumes .. For those readers that have a proclivity to enjoy coming of age books as told by a young man than this is the best of all Victorian examples I have ever devoured.... <br />A fifteen year old Charlie Roberts he manages to witness a recently married houseguest, Mrs. Benson, in the thoes of sex with her husband. The little voyeur is soon discovered by the newlywed, and, instead of becoming outraged and immediately snitching on his parents, Mrs. B swears Charlie to keep 'their secret' and she will 'reward him' for his silence. Well let me tell you what a deviously delicious reward it was, and, she went out of her way to reward Charlie over and over..... Matter of fact, she introduced Charlie to her friend and she also rewarded him over and over ......<br />Our hero, very quickly decides to spread his newfound knowledge with his two younger sisters and, feigning innocence, allows himself to be seduced by two successive live-in governesses, one of which he actually impregnates...... <br />Charlie's appetite for the erotic and sexual becomes voracious as he managed to either seduce, or let himself be seduced, by practically anyone that comes within his grasp, including, of course, (it is after all Victorian erotic lit) his mother .... Male and female alike fall under his spell one way or another ....<br />I can't imagine much under the norms either eroticism or sexuality that isn't described in the most delicious and intimate detail in this book so it's easy to understand why repeated print runs, over the past 40 years alone, have been bought by Grove Press, Caroll & Graf, Masquarade Books and now in 2002 a new edition by Blue Moon to be relased in June. If the past sales are any indication, this edition will sell out fast as well and will also be treasured as keepsaked for those naughtiest of moments to read alone<br />unquote	2002-09-18

WOW	Anyone that has read 'Cruel Enchantment' probably needs little encouragement to buy this latest novel from Janine Ashbless. <br />The story takes us back in time to a land where the Irolian warrior rulers send one of their young generals, Veraine,  and a troop of his top soldiers to protect the ancient temple city of Mulhanabin against an attack by the unwashed hordes, aptly name, the Horse Eaters. <br />The city is of interest to the barbarians since a young female, considered to be a god by the city's occupants, of course lievs within the temple, and, must, at all costs, be protected. The general not being one to worship any gods is like a fish out of water while he and his men prepare for the imminent attack. <br />At the very beginning of the book, and true to the authors style, general Veraine's private celebration, after being advised of his promotion to general, with two slave girls belonging to his superior officer, is in my mind worth the price of the book alone.<br />For those of us that love sizzling erotica set in make believe times and lands I also suggest that you check out 'Primal Skin' by Leona Benkt Rhys, and 'The Hand of Amun' by Juliet Hastings  ..... trust me you will not leave the room or these books until you have deoured them or they have devoured you ....	2002-09-11

If the title alone doesn't run a cold shiver down your spine then certainly once you hit the first few chapters of this astoundingly disturbing book the story will more than catch the readers immediate attention.<br />No, it's not just another whining 'survivor' or 'I overcame it all' type of book but rather an in your face account of a four year old boy, victimized, by his pervert father. With superb writing skills, the author, takes us back into the mind of that boy as he must, with his mother, brothers and sister, live, unprotected and vulnerable while his father continues to play 'The Game'.<br />The author's family, amazingly enough, members of a very closed and tight knit Christian community of Jehova's Witnesses, continues to live and interact in the community until the pervert father makes a mistake and tries to seduce one of the brothers who finally brings the pedophelia to the light of day. <br />Needless to say the author soon realizes that his mother, church elders, teachers and even the police repeatedly betray his calls for help displaying nothing more than indifference and cowardice to face up to a disgusting pervert in the community molesting one of his own sons. <br />Although certainly not my usual reading fare, I couldn't put this book down or stop thinking about the disturbing content. The authors writing skills are superb, the book is an easy read, maintains the readers interest and the story flows. As well, the author certainly avoids the modern day fashionable pitfall of 'Christian bashing' that seems to be a very very popular pastime of the media today.<br />I recommend this highly thought provoking work, it places some perspective on that dirty little secret, and, the reader should not expect to walk away from this story unscathed  .....	2002-09-09

Well, control certainly is not one of her strong points as her husband, Nicholas, has no problems in having his wife strip continuously, and, mostly at the dinner table. <br />Nicholas does'nt touch his wife since he has Jamie, faithful, young and virile manservant to do most of his bidding and diddling .... <br />Our young heroine with nothing but idle time on her hands soon ties up, in more ways than one, with the locals, Daniel, a split personality  and his delicious sister Gussie. <br />The book has an interesting story and is easy to read but I had some trouble trying to get into the characters mood and I really thought that the husband, Nicholas was a complete turn off dork.....   <br />Although I am a fan of the authors writing I guess I should be guilty in comparing this book to 'Gothic Blue' and 'Continuum' which I rated much higher ......	2002-09-07

We see the school and the wild wild wild 'goings on', for lack of a better word, through young Presley's eyes as he tries to fit into the student body at Oxford, forgive the pun but he manages to fit into a lot of student bodies! <br />I don't know what your experience at a college may have been but let me tell you the girls in this book certainly give the word 'libido' a whole new meaning. <br />There is a tiny tiny little plot in the book, very limited character development, but who needs plot and character when the sex is so continuous, spontaneaous and pretty perverted .... <br />It's not the greatest of erotica but I still give it 4 stars for the sheer creativity .....

At a very very young age she does violently strike out at one of the 'mentors' around her and generally finds that whether by manipulation or violence she does seem to get her way. <br />I enjoyed the book and found it to be a very quick read in one sitting ...

Needless to say it doesn't take long for him to tell one of his young female parishoners to come to his office later that night for Gods punishment for her sins.....   <br />The author actually allows us to eneter into Father Micheal's mind as he convinces himself and his young and nubile followers that he is only an instrument of the lord and the he and they are really only following their free will ....

As well do not expect ANY words or thought of any semblance of intelligence in this story ....

It took me quite a while to get my hands on this book since it has been sold out and was just re-printed im May 2002. <br />Storm Dupre, the somewhat jaded chef, French of course, decides to leave California and take a job at a small Cape Cod restaurant that has fallen on hard times due to a lack of a creative menu and subsequently, customers. Abby, The owner of the Coates Inn realizes that if she is going to make the restaurant work she is going to have to get a new chef or face highly probable bankruptcy. <br />Up to the point that Storm shows up, Abbie's life could be summed up as normal and as predictable as a ham and eggs breakfast as she decides to not only get a new chef but also unceremoniously dump her long time boyfriend. This situation of course left Abbie quite exposed when she meets with Storm, a man that considers women to be a fine five course meal to be savoured .... Abbie comes (forgive the pun) through in living colours showing that shes up to the task and then some .... <br />All in all I think this is one of Emma Holly's more gentle books and the eroticism is of course masterfully written. Although we have the obligatory lesbian love interest in the form of Abbie's roomate, our heroine manages to stay pretty well in the hetero <BR>domains of her now whirlwind life. <br />As such, Cooking up a Storm is a super sexual awakening story that I really enjoyed and recommend ....	2002-08-03

The following is a review of 'Plaisir D'Amour' as full novel that is included in 'Passion d'Amour'...... this is a fabulous stand alone erotica novel and in the case of this author just getting your hands on a copy is difficult enough .....<br />Quote  <br />Anne-Marie Villefranche's books have been published and re-published as stand alone novels, and, most vexingly as mutliple book novels such as this book Passion D'Amour, with, a new title that has a tendency to obscure the original titles. So, if your are like moi, an afficionado of erotica the chances are excellent that you will have multiple copies of this authors' book ..... that may be the bad news, but, the good news is that her books are fabulous enough that you'll always have a copy nearby to read when you want to while away solitary moments. <br />This book (Passion d'Amour) has two full novels.... <br />1) Palisir d'Amour 2) Joi d'Amour <br />In 'Plaisir' the author takes us on a rollercoaster ride of 10 short stories with different characters, plots and settings. Each story of approximately 20 to 30 pages is so well written and so well developed that the reader does not feel cheated after finishing the story and demnding more. Each story has its own climax (so to say) and the characters are so well developed to make the tale viable. <br />The author very masterfully is able to tell a story without having to get into lengthly set-up before the story even begins. She does this by very deftly tying all the characters together as the sons, daughters, wives etc of a large well known and libidinous Parisienne family in the 1920's .... absolutely marvellous .... <br />To give you a flavour of the book, in the first story, Jeanne Takes A Lover' we find the young Christophe Brissard (some think this is the author's family) meeting the very married Jeanne Vernay (another well known Parisienne family) at a family dinner. Jeanne visits Christophe in his bedroom, after everyone went to bed, and our two lovers wastelittle time in tasting the fruits of the flesh. Jeanne however keeps warning Christophe that during his lovemaking he takes her to heights she has never been before and she is very scared. Their secret encounters continue while Christphe and jeanne slowly teach each other to let loose their inhibitions. <br />In 'Joie d'Amour' we find a similar number of scrumptios short stories. In 'A Lesson for Bernard' a young Bernard Gaillard meets a married Simone Lebrun at a Brissard family dinner. Since taking a lover is such a very very French thing to do Simone and Bernard eventually find themselves together in bed where <BR>Simone is more intersted in using her hands to make love to Bernard than other parts of her body. Although she gives in to Bernards requirment to complete the sex act, Simone simply explains to him that this does not give her the ultimate <BR>pleasure she yearns for, but, she would just rather play with him using her hands. The young Bernard is so disconcerted he seeks the advice of more learned friends to be able to reconcile Simones wants and wishes to his desire to continue the clandestine affair.... <br />Wonderfull works of erotic literature I recommend any of Veillefranches book highly ....	2002-06-14

In 'Maison Bizarre' a group of six young and nubile girls are more or less snatched from diiferent parts of Europe to be taken to a mansion of the Madam Maxan. The young girls, not fearing their 'captivity' are taken on a gently journey of erotic and sexual delights. The author's mastery of describing the the architectural beauty of the mansion make the setting very much part of the erotic experience. <br />In 'Lust Akademie' the second story, we find a school set in the backwoods of Europe for the purpose of providing a 'proper education of young ladies', and, a 'proper' erotic education is certainly provided. <br />In 'Baden Eros' the reader is treated to the experiences of Van Spinnaan, architect by repute but voyeur by choice. The story describes the sexual awakenings of vistiors to a European healing spa that was newly built over a re-discovered rejuvinating spring. The seeming magical powers of the healing waters loosen more than inhibitions of the visitors while our young Van Spinaan meanders through his voyeur's architectural wonder devouring the sights and sounds of carnal lust .... <br />As in the book 'The Architecture of Desire' the author displays his own distinct writing style and provides the reader of erotic literature with rich  descriptions of the mansions and the gentle but deterimined activities of the followers and practicioners of sappho and bacchus within.....

Well let me tell you what a deviously delicious reward it was, and, she went out of her way to reward Charlie over and over..... Matter of fact, she introduced Charlie to her friend and she also rewarded him over and over ......<br />Our hero, very quickly decides to spread his newfound knowledge with his two younger sisters and, feigning innocence, allows himself to be seduced by two successive live-in governesses, one of which he actually impregnates......  <br />Charlie's appetite for the erotic and sexual becomes voracious as he managed to either seduce, or let himself be seduced, by practically anyone that comes within his grasp, including, of course, (it is after all Victorian erotic lit) his mother .... Male and female alike fall under his spell one way or another ....<br />I can't imagine much under the norms either eroticism or sexuality that isn't described in the most delicious and intimate detail in this book so it's easy to understand why repeated print runs, over the past 40 years alone,  have been bought by Grove Press, Caroll & Graf, Masquarade Books and now in 2002 a new edition by Blue Moon to be relased in June. If the past sales are any indication, this edition will sell out fast as well and will also be treasured as keepsaked for those naughtiest of moments to read alone ....	2002-05-17

Whenever I buy a Blue Moon book I guess I never really know what to expect excapt that probably the story will take some form of kink or fetish and expand it to a wild ride..... <br />The Architecture of Desire contains two books 'The Hotel Justine' and 'Villa Sin' ....<br />I the first book we find a young Miranda receiving an invitation from her cousin, Jenny, to apply for a position at Hotel Justine in the (of course) backwoods hills of a French city. From the onset of Mirnadas trip to the hotel the young girl meets a distingushed and kind 'older' lady and her footman, and letting her guard down get drugged and helplessly seduced only to wake up alone unable to find her seducers. <br />Once at the hotel she finds that Jenny has been transferred to another 'hotel' on the coast and she starts to work from cleaning girl to sexual plaything of the wealthy and hungry.....<br />In 'The Villa Sin', similarily, a young Arabella travels to receive a family villa that is relplete with erotic art, literature and rooms especially made for sexual escapades that are described by the author as being almost ananymous or as if we see the players though a haze ..... <br />Both books are excellently written and you have to take your time to 'feel' the setting which is usually describe in great detail ..... So if you enjoy books of anonymous sex or ravishment by unseen hands in intricate and elegant surroundings then this book is a must have 5 star special ....	2002-05-13

OK so when I read the phrase 'sexually voracious beasts' in the editorial reviews red warnings lights should have gone off but I thought that these beasts were marauding Vikings rather than their trusty doggies ..... Wrong .... <br />Set in a mythical land of warriors, trolls and slaves we find our heroine, Aisla, rescuing another young nubile, Sulitea from the sexual slavery of what would probably considered a convent. The story then develops as the twoo girls must now go into hiding since they are 'belongings' that must be returned to their masters for retribution. <br />Actually considering the subject matter the authors' writing is quite good, but, pretty darned hard core.  Most of the sex is rape and I got the distinct impression that people that enjoy seduction scenes by using virtual 2 by 4's and force raped by squads of men and trolls, then this has to be the book for you. That little issue of bestiality,as well should really not bother you either I might add ....... <br />I, personally, did not like the book, but I still give it 5 stars since it was written for a very specific readership ....	2002-05-13

Generally I'm not much a of a fan of compiled erotic anthologies due to either substandard or inconsistent writing, but this book was wonderfull and very gentle for the erotic novice ..... <br />Although I was only familiar with the writings of a couple of the contributors the stroies were well chosen to provide the reader with a smorgesbourg of fantasies. Erotic Massages, rape fantasies, having sex in public, erotic spankings, daddy fantasies, bad student fantasy, multiple parters stories are all included. <br />If it's everyman's dream to watch two girls getting it on this book has a sizzling little story for the girls watching two guys getting it on. When you see the title of Erotic Fantaies for 'Couples' one should easliy read that to mean 'Women' since I think the book is defintely geared towards the gentler sex getting their husband or boyfriend in the sack rather than the other way around.....	2002-05-09

James, Being the black sheep of his family on the verge of being disinherited by his family, jumps at the chance to go to Ironwood at the behest of his rouge uncle to take up a position that is the fantasy of young men. <br />The school, run by Cora Blasingdale, is dedicated to collecting very young girls for training as houskeepers, (for the ugly ones) while the rest are well trained, highly submissive, sexual partners for the wealthy. James, being the only male at the school, is very quickly introduced to the gentle teaching methods of the matrons that the reader could describe as S/M with fur gloves .... <br />Although James does get to taste the forbidden fruit at the school, most of the sex scenes are adolescent and rarely finish in what would be expected in an adult sexual encounter. That frustrating fact notwithstanding, I did finish the book surprised that the author managed to maintain my attention while other books of the same genre would have had me screaming after the fifth spanking of the young charges.	2002-05-07

The two of them pretty well fight through most of <BR>the book since they each want what the other has, and, can ya believe it, they hated each other from day one in grade school.

Cassie on the other hand is not wealthy and lives with a couple, Helen and Lucien Delavignes. Helen is a devout follower of the sapphic arts while Cassie our heroine gets her pleasures wherever she can find them ....<br />I didn't give the book five stars since I believe that the players are pretty well all of the same age and social group, and, all appear to be so so so polite and gentle.

Bakker, have I found an author with the mastery of being able to take the reader on a fantastic and wonderfull journey through the mind and become part of the political, social, very sexual  and erotic structure of a hive. <br />The book starts with the Queen bee assasinated by the head attendant of one of the five daughter princesses who must remain in a state of pre-pubescence until the death of the queen. Once the queen dies a race ensues with attendents obtaining the catalyctic 'royal jelly' needed for the princesses to undergo a biological maturing transition into queen before any of her sisters, since, there can only be one queen bee in the hive. <br />The book starts in a fury with an intensity that never seems to subside as we follow the new queen through the trails and tribulations of her new found, or should I say, new fought, power in the hive. The hive is obviously matriarchal and the females call all the shots as they are the only ones that can change males from the postion of workers or soldiers to that of drones, adult males, fully sexual, to be kept in private harems of the females......  <br />The drones, of course, are there to be used and abused, but according to the rules of the hive, are protected, and usually hidden, by the female owners. Drones, on the other hand, are powerless to really resist the advances of any female of the hive ....... <br />The authors skill and mastery thrusts the reader into the intrigue of the hive and the different classes of bees and bestows human qualities and attributes (body parts) on our players in such a magnificent and unintrusive manner  that the reader is able to effortlessly identify themselves as a member of the hive to enjoy the story. The importance of 'human' sexuality and eroticism is not dumped on the reader but rather it's interwoven into the story to make it not only believable but sinfully delicious.......<br />Certainly any reader that enjoyed the erotic book 'Cruel Enchantment' by Janine Ashbless should ask for overnight delivery from Amazon cause you are going to gobble up these 500 something pages of what I consider to be a masterpiece of an adventure and an erotic fantasy .......	2002-04-01

Once cesare storms and caprues the citadel the ensuing rape and control of he countess is perhaps some of trhe most erotic of all writings .. bar none .... <br />Adama and Eve, the third book, although it has been publishedboth as a seperate novel and also in other Carroll & Graf combined books is also a wonderfull masterpiece .... <br />This book deals with a young aspiring actreess Eve and her young artist lover, Adam who find they must leave each others side so they could further their interests and desires in the arts they have chosen. <br />Loking for a sponsor, Adama was introduced to Mrs. Goldbaum, and she makes an effort to take the young man under her wing, and most practically every other part of her body as well, to impulse him into both the sexual and art world. <br />WOW what a super erotic novel as we follow the two young lovers though distinct and erotic upbringings .... <br />Probably one of the best and most erotic of volumes .......	2002-03-16

A good book by Natasha Rostova but not great at with 'Tea and Spices' and 'The Naked Truth' which I felt were true erotic masterpieces. <br />In Captivation, our heroine, Katya, although a very sexual person was just that, sexual and not erotic. The impression that this reader got was that Katya came from a wealthy family, friends of the zars' and as such was pretty uptight repetedly thinking that she is too high in society to be used and abused by many of the soldiers and officers in this book. I guess the only time that I felt she really let her sensuality show when she fondles a young soldier on a train trip early in the book. Unfortunately that feeling and atmosphere did not continue. <br />Now the book may not be a Dr. Zivago in its description of the conflict and revolution in Russia but we do get and idea of the times and the people... <br />If you like period piece erotica with empasis on the period piece part then you should probably enjoy this book ....	2002-03-11

This book, like all others from this now deceased author were translated from French in the 1980's from memoirs that recently became public. Anne Marie's books have been translated into many many languages and are timeless in their appeal and eroticism. Based mainly on the authors', or her friends real life, and somewhat embellished experiences, I understand that she wrote these  books for her own personal erotic gratification. What a marvellous stroke of luck that many of the memoirs have come to light for us to enjoy. <br />Most, if not all of the authors books deal with games of life and love that the decadent wealthly played incessantly in Paris during the 1920's. The theme of many of the stories seem to invariably involve beutifull and wealthy society women, which, I must say,  pretty well have the morals of alley cats, and are usually on the hunt for men and erotic diversions. For the hunt to be enjoyable, the hunted should usually not be aware of the game and feel that he is the master of his own destiny, what a laugh .... most of the men really don't know what had hit them though they would be lax in admitting to themselves that they were used and abused at will ..... <br />In Scandale D'Amour,  we find two very similar books titled 'Mystere D'Amour'  which is 320 pages and 'Folies D'Amour' which is 248 pages in length. <br />Both books are a compendium of short stories each with its own plot, characters  and delicious stories of erotic seduction and submission. The author has an innate knack for allowing the reader to quickly identify with one or another of the characters in each story making one feel as though you are a vicarious participant. BTW Anna Marie Villafranche's prose and descriptions of the love scenes can span 10 to 20 pages as she is a master in drawing out those delicious sinfull moments. It's not the hump and bump of many of our contemporary authors .... <br />I had some trouble finding this book and I can assure you it's not leaving my little library of erotic masterpieces any time soon .....	2002-03-04

First, the mixed blood local ladies are so sexually agressive from a very very young age that most of the local men by the age of 20 are so worn out that thoughts of even considering sex seem painfull. Needless to say that makes matters worse for the girls who, reaching their age of sexual desire and maturity find that they must practically rape any man whose slight interest they may be able to capture. <br />Add to that mix the wives of all the diplomats on the island having to cope and compete with their husbands access to more sex from young girls than they could have imagined makes this a very sexually active erotic book ......	2002-02-21

This is a 208 page book with eleven stories of erotic spanking that is probably the best ever written. <br />The namesake 'Managing Mrs Burton' is the first story and deals with a young fourty one year old Personnell Manager of a Japanese Company in the UK being sent to the home/office of Paul Barnett to be spanked for an indiscretion at work. Our heroine submits to this abuse when she signed her contract at the company that feels they can keep employees motivated with this threat of corporal punishment. Of course, Paul had to be living in an Edwardian redbrick just to remind the reader that this is Edwardian rather than Victorian erotica?

I must add this is a deviation from the Blue Moon regular fare that tends to steer towards the S&M, spank, dominationa and discipline type of fare  ..... <br />Ursula, a 27 year old beauty has a strong urges for latex (OK so I called it rubber, shows what I know) ever since she got a glimpse of her father having a shower while wearing a snug black latex shower cap. Without going into the little girls and their fathers thing, something snapped (forgive the latex visualization here) in Ursula and she was hooked into finding men wearing latex on the beaches.  <br />The story then starts with Ursula meeting latex clad Adrian (of course) and his very young gay lover at a motel pool, and, certainly it doesn't take long for Ursula to be in their room sucking in more than one or two of the ice cold martinis that were being enjoyed by our happy threeesome. I kind of like that cause the martinis gave the book a grown up 'sauvoi faire' mood.<br />What makes this fetish book stand swim caps above the crowd is that there is a small story here as all the characters struggle with their homosexuality and love of latex, and, I might add enough of a story that I did manage to finish the book ..... now what in the world did I do with that latex swim cap cause I've gotta stop writing this review and get the the beach  ....	2002-02-06

The fact that this is a 2001 reprint of a novel first published in 1998 certainly provides an indication of a new (for me anyway) and talented erotica author Sedelia Johnson ...... <br />Set in Britain in the 1750's, Amelia our heroine is orpahned by the untimely death of both her mother and father and is sent to the hinterland to live with one of her aunts, her fathers sister. While there she meets a young, beautifull and very sexually active cousin, Connie who is being bedded by the Marquess Lucas. <br />Lucas, of course, has all the women in the neighbourhood eating out of his hand, or whatever, and he considers Amelia a challenge and her virginity a treat. In a flash he is betrothed to marry Amelia and poor Connie get sent to London to live with another aunt while they try to hook up a new suter/husband for Connie. <br />Lucas, since he is getting major nookie from Connie only uses Amelia as sexual entertainment and no matter how much she would beg Amelia never looses her virginity. Connie, a day befor leaving, and as a revenge for Lucas having abandoned her takes Amelias virginity. Well, I dont want to tell you how surprised Lucas was when, a coupe of days after their marriage, and in front of a whole group of libertine friends, he dicovers that poor Amelia is not that virgin bride he expected. The fact that Connie did the deed had no import to good ole Lucas ... <br />Lucas decides to take off for a few weeks and leaves his house and Amelia in control of one of his freinds whose task it was to discipline Amelia and teach her what it's all about. Frustrated as she was Amelia takes off and escapes to London to meet up again with Connie  at another aunts house ... <br />Amelia certainly gets the training she's looking for and A LOT of relieve to her frustration and domination of her husband as Lucas decides to follow her and bring her back home ..	2002-02-05

Young Joy after being mistreated by her father for years decides that men really aren't her cup of tea. So, what does a virgin of that age do, well she of course makes friends with Lydia, a professiona, bi sexual lady of the streets.  If that seems strange to you then, well, its really a little contrived to me as well. <br />It's not a stretch then that Lydia seduces Joy, and, from one moment to the next, Joy the unasuming virgin decides to go into biz with Lydia, open a house of ill repute and stff it with Lydias friends . We now find Mr Moore, the real estate agent, Michelle, Valerie and later Claudette ext as the new house is staffed and opened ..... <br />The story stays with Joy as Michelle and her domineering lesbian skills are better than Lydias soon takes control of Joy and gets her into all manners of situations including some of which where Joy really looses her virginity by being raped by Mr Moore ..... <br />Joy is basically a confirmed die hard follwer of Sappho and even though she has sex with men it's pretty well rape all the time. So, I guess, if your thing is having die hard lesbians dominated and raped by men you would probably rate this book as a 5 star zinger, me, well you know I like erotica better where there is some semblance of pursuit, capture, submission etc etc .....	2002-02-05

Unfortunately, Bonhams' engaged slutty daughter sees a fly in the ointment should her father marry a girl younger than her and, maybe cut her out of her well calculated and expected inheritance .... <br />This book is OK but wins no prizes in Victorian erotica as far as I'm concerned ....<br />\\"The Memoirs of Dolly Morton' a 200 page book deals with Dolly, a beautifull Southern belle relating her story to a young Englishman about her young life in the South working for the 'underground railroad' and aiding escaped slaves. <br />This is a strong willfull story with more sex, per se, rather  than eroticism .... This story I believe is in a seperate book 'Deep South' by Richard Manton, a very very hot novel if you are into Southern erotica which has a distict flavour all its own ...<br />'Laura Middleton' is a 99 page purely victorian erotic story that rocks ..... The story in effect is told though the eyes of young Frank as a house guest of the Middletons. Frank has no trouble in seducing Laura, the maid, Lauras brother and everyone that comes into his reach .. It's a hot hot story and I loved it .... <br />'Flossie: A Venus of Sixteen' is a super classic of Vitorian erotic literature and and its 69 pages have been published many many times as seperate books.

The first 63 pages are a story 'Some more about my little cousin' and tells a tale of a discrete young man, (whatelse of course) who meets his young cousin, Gilberte, in a house of ill repute in Paris. The shock and surprise are soon overcome and the story continues with the French doing what they do so well ..... <br />The second story 'Madame Germaine at home' is the story of a young man meeting the Madame in the town not only unaccompanied but also with a non descrotp coach and driver so that she could get into mischief without being seen. Well our two friends certainly do get into mischief ..... <br />The last two stories are very short and as well deal with women that knowingly or unknowingly seek out men to (surprisingly) enjoy their afternoons with.<br />the book is written with considerable dialogue and is easy to read and flows well.

I noted that the pages have the name 'Davina' on top of each printed page leading me to believe that this book has been renamed, and, probably was published under the name of 'Davina' previously. <br />In this book we find the story of a young English lad, 15ish year old, Harry, who recounts his life experience  and sexual education living with his parents and two sisters in the English countryside. Like most of these very wonderfull books, our gero and his family does not get tied down for lack of money since these families are all inevitably 'well to do' and only have to spend their waking hours seeking mischief and hedonistic satisfactions. Since, of course, their geographical access was limited to carriage and horse rides, these pleasures and diversions were usually found in the beds of those people that are closest, including mothers, sisters, sons and duaghters  etc etc ..... <br />While reading these books, the reader should note that during Victorian times, incest was not really considered a sin, (nor was it a crime) by most of the population, except, that is, for the church, that was heavily at work trying to change the sexual mores of the Victorian society ..... <br />Another great Victorian pastime appears to have been hypnotism, real or not, which allowed the community to partake in the most erotic and licentios sex without any remorse, since, they were, of course, under an evil spell. Appart from the literature, works of fune art during those times, both in England and on the mainland, have many paintings of women that are being raped, or depict dreams of being raped by devil like forms, which, was another convenient way of removing the remorse of hours and hours of carnal activities. <br />In this book, Harry meets Davina, a lady of wealth living alone in a mansion next to his family, she takes him under her wing, and everything else, and teaches Harry how to sexually'conquer' every single female that his little heart desires and that is within his reach. The author presents us with a tableaux of eroticism letting the reader enjoy the surprise, resistance, domanation and ultimate submission by the subjects of Harry's attentions. <br />This book is a definite must have for our little Victorian erotic library, and, like all the classics, and by my experience, probably won't be in stock or print for long .......	2001-11-26

The author, Henry Morgan, manages to spin a tale of adventure, torture, S/M, dominance and submission using modern day Afganistan, Pakistan and the UK, and injects the erotic spiciness of the region into a full fledged novel ....<br />Our hero, David, meets up with a long lost schoolmate, Justin, in the UK, and Justin is then very very surprised to learn that David has set up a very successfull school, of course in a mansion in the hinterlands of London, where he takes posession of wives and daughters and teaches them the wonderfull art of total and utter submission to their husbands or furture husbands. <br />The book then details the events in Afganistan and the middle East that led to David starting his special school. After graduating as a doctor, our hero went to Afganistan to help the poor where he was captured by rebels, tribal chieftans and even the Russians with the task of keeping the female prisoners alive while they were being 'tortured' into full submission. In the midst of battle David manages to escape to Pakistan where he meets up with a married banker who soon tells him that the submission tortures were not to be frowned upon but rather considered a necessity in the training of the women folk in their part of the world. <br />Although David has morals and scruples, from the beginning to the end of the book the reader certainly enjoys his plight as hed bends, twists and shreds those nasty morals to be able to enjoy the moment. <br />Generally when I hear S/M, torture, dominance etc etc in a book I usually run, anot walk, away from the purchase, but on this book tha author has produced and absolutlely fabulous piece of work mainaining eroticism of the scenes without overdoing the violence etc etc ....

Kim, is no shrinking violet and has no trouble in exploring those submissive erotic dreams that she has had in order to get into the story, or I guess for the story to get into her ... <br />The author manages to gently take Kim down that slippery slope of eroticism as Kim step by step succumbs to delicious surrender.

Rather than telling  Johnathans parents about the activities of their young son, Beth decides that she will punish him for breaking into her privacy ..... <br />The resulting encounters are so delicious and so erotic that had I been Johnathan, at that age, receiving the attention and the so delicious punishments that Beth meted out, I am sure that  they surely would have had to put me away as a simpering idiot ........ <br />Susie Raymond, the author, has manged to, forgive the pun, put her finger on great erotic wrinting skills in the inexorable and gradual build up of sexual and emotional tension before the players actually complete the final delicious act.

I just recently managed to get my hands on a copy of this book and darn if I didn't read it before under another title.<br />Sensual Secrets if a compilation of eight stories that wwere probably published in novellete form back about 70 years ago in France. The two major stories are of course 'Sensual Secrets' and 'Nocturnal Pleasures' which take up 148 pages of the 220 page book. <br />In the first book we meet Jaqueline and Michelle on vacations of escape on a French beachside resort. We join in the seduction of the two as the author switches from her to his point of view in each of the chapters. Like a balmy beach breeze the seduction and lovemaking is sweet and fresh .....<br />The second book is divided into five seperate geographical sections English, Egyption, American Chinese Spanish, Hawaiian and of course, French pleasures. The stories are told from the perspectives of three mature men smoking cigars in a private men's club and trying to relive their most erotic life experiences of the past .... truly wonderfull and gentle stories to exite even the deadest of people.... <br />The remaining short stories are small love stories writtten by Irene, Jeannine and Claire ..... <br />This is a wonderfull book of what I would consider light erotic reading probably great for the beginner of eortica today ......	2001-10-29

Although there is a smattering of B&amp;D in this book it's very very light realtive to many other books on the market today, that's for sure! Carmen, the young Cuban girl living in Miami does the fashionable thing that is so popular and seems to connect with a past life as the gitrfriend of a vanquished Viking warrior. <br />Instantly, or so it seems, Carmen is transformed from maintaining monogomous relationships to a very sexually active wanton with three domineering men, and, oh yes she does really love it .... <br />Interestingly the author manages to maintain the readers interest in Carmen and her sexual escapages because it is so well described and real life. Carmen does bed her married boss, (I guess I should say pool because thats where she does him) and, like real life, she certainly does not waste much waking time being introspective or self recriminating afterward. I like that. <br />Although we get a taste for Miami and Carmens cubaness, it's really really underplayed since we never get to see any members of Carmens family (a must in any Lating girls life), we see her last name Palasios misspelled since I think it should be Palacios, and finally, the maid of one of the men should come  from Colombia, the country and not Columbia the university<br />This is the perfect light reading book that would while away the hours on a long and dreary flight .....	2001-10-29

Maggie, like her mother before her is brought to work as a maid's assitant in a wealthy home until she is first willingly seduced by the son of the owner and then raped by the wealthy owner. <br />The problem of course that Maggie had was that even though she never seemd to give in to the continuous rapes by different disgusting men around her, once the rape began she felt betrayed by her own body that responded favourably to the male 'attentions'. <br />This book may not suit all readers tastes in that, with the exception of the handsome young son, Jermey, all the other men in the book were utterly loathsome, ugly, fat and disgusting trolls. That Maggie had to suffer thru the seduction and rapes by these beasts while she just tried to keep herself alive, in a world where no one would help her, made the book chilling to read. <br />'Sinful Seductions' is an excellent book exquisitely written by an author that certainly did a considerable amoount of historical work to make it ring true to life.	2001-10-22

After being there for a short while she hunts and seduces her boss, Simon, a day before she is sent to a seminar in a small Northern town. <br />To say that Beth is a very sexual person would probably be the understatement of the millenium since there seems to be very few people, either male or female that she doesn't like to couple with.  I must admit that I did find it hard to believe that her first lesbian experience happens in this book at her age! Trust me with her libido, and the fact that she has been diddling herself since she was small makes this part even harder to swallow... <br />The great thing about this book is that it is well written and I never lost interest even though it is jam packed with raw sex. I guess I got a kick out of our oversexed heroine that seemed to always take mental steps back to watch herself having orgiastic sex with people she just met. The fact that Beth was a liscentious slut really didn't seem to bother her and that really was the wonderfull juice of the story.<br />The author certainly attained the Black Lace standard of a well written, easy to read, complete and believeable story of a woman that knows what she wants and then does not, supposedly,(at least not due to self recrimination retrospection) loose any sleep over her nightime escapades.... <br />On an aside though and for thisand other contemporary authors, puullllleeeeze ...... lets stop the dumb safe sex condom references, gimme a break, it's erotic lit after all. I'm sick and tired of the warning lables on cigarettes, alcohol, movies, music etc etc not have to deal with this during the quiet little moments that I get to read a yummie book.....considering all the things they do in erotic lit books it appears very gratuitous, and definitely not a trun on for the heroine to have to rip the foil wrapper off a condom 20 or 30 times in the book. It's a given OK the girl practices safe sex..just say it and then lets get on with the story please .....  I mean when they get into a car you do not have to be told ... every single time ...they take out the key and put it into the ignition ..... right ...	2001-10-17

Published first in the 1980's (I believe) and credited to anonymous, recent print runs give authorship credit to James Jennings, the master of some of the finest erotic lit around.<br />By the title, Sweet Confessions, the reader should note that both the books deal with sins of the flesh in a religious setting during Victorian times in Europe. If sex, eroticism and debauchery between the clergy and they sheepish followers offends you, then do not buy this book.... OK ...<br />The first book, 'Therese' is about 123 pages and describes the life of a poor village girl in her 20's and her sexual education at the hands of the infamous Father Dirrag and the young Eradice. Much of the book deals with the rationalization as to why sex among the clergy and their followers is not only and accepted practice, due to our freedom of choice, but also encouraged. <br />The book may drag a little at times, and, the sex is limited but it's an easy read as the author takes us down the road to pernition and sins of the flesh.<br />The second book, 'Angelica' approximately 98 pages in length, as well deals with a young girl and her description of life in a convent. In contrast to Therese, our little heroine has no problems in literally jumping into a cloistered lecherous life in the convent with a great deal of unbridled enthusiasm. <br />Both books have been published as seperate volumes and for the conosieur of erotic lit they are all delicious little munchies ....	2001-10-11

The great thing about this book is that the plot can be  believable and the erotic sex is carefully planned and executed, or, should I say, devoured ....<br />I guess the best description of the book is that it is a journey into day dreams that most of us have probably had during a boring business meeting with an attractive member of the opposite sex. As the talk of budgets etc continue, the eyes glaze over and the mind wanders to more delicious things. <br />The fact that these musings rarely come to fruition makes this book enticing in that our heroine id forced to submit to a 90 day test of being the sexual and erotic plaything of the all important new client that can make or break your career...<br />So one moment Gennevieve is the, young, beautifull and  unreachable professional, and, in a flash, she accepts the offer of a new contract, with conditions, and is stitting butt a.. naked on the back of a Harley being fondled by another driver at 65 mph.....  <br />As a Black Lace novel it certainly is an erotic book for young women on the run and it's easily understandable why you'll find most print runs will sell out immediately .....  oh those naughty naughty daydreams .... well done Lucinda Carrington	2001-10-11

I can not imagine, page for page, packing more sex into a book and still maintain some semblance of a story line, but, I guess I should have expected this from one of the USA's best and hottest 'erotic' lit writers today. <br />I have to qualify 'erotic' since this book is not really eortic in the classic sense but rather an 'in your face' marathon sex race. The amazing thing is that it's so well written and scrumptious that you will not put it down. Definitely it's written from a strong woman's point of view as our heroine gets to squeeze her way into a sexual relationship with her two young hunk boarders. Note that I didn't use that 'homo' word, cause these two guys are probably what women would dream that homosexuals are like. <br />Real life ain't like that, but, who cares we buy these books to get a look at real life  ... I think NOT.<br />OK so I loved the book and I think that Kate, Sean and Joe have to get gold medals if they ever make sex part of the Olympics.	2001-10-10

If you have follwed some of my other reviews you may note that Manton is a 'Jekyl and Hyde' type of writer you never really know which author you are going to get.<br />The books that I have blasted are his hamrem/slave/prison genre that may spend hundrdes of pages and just plain spankings and beatings without the slightes morsel of what I would consider to be anything close to erotic. But then there are the other Manton books where Manton delves into erotic sex of the characters and it is there that the author absolutely excells as being one of the greatest erotic writers of the times. <br />Dream Boat is one of his masterpieces. In this Book, the author takes us on a journey with 11 stories, and, the central theme being the ocean and the playgrounds of the rich. All the stories places our main characters in hidden villas overlooking the ocean beaches, on gleaming white majestic yachts quietly slicing thought the water, or, even a small skif with a young man rowing his mistress into the secluded safety of a cove. <br />As the author takes us on this erotic journey he lists probably 20 or more books of the theme in question and then alloes us a delicious taste of the best parts of the book. <br />Even though thise mini novels and excertps leaves on frustrated the single theme of this book makes the stories paletable and a pleasure to read ......	2001-10-01

So, if your are like moi, an afficionado of erotica the chances are excellent that you will have multiple copies of this authors' book ..... that may be the bad news, but, the good news is that her books are fabulous enough that you'll always have a copy nearby to read when you want to while away solitary moments. <br />This book has two full novels.... <br />1) Palisir d'Amour 2) Joi d'Amour <br />In Plaisir the author takes us on a rollercoaster ride of 10 short stories with different characters, plots and settings. Each story of approximately 20 to 30 pages is so well written and so well developed that the reader does not feel cheated after finishing the story and demnding more. Each story has its own climax (so to say) and the characters are so well developed to make the tale viable. <br />The author very masterfully is able to tell a story without having to get into lengthly set-up before the story even begins. She does this by very deftly tying all the characters together as the sons, daughters, wives etc of a large well known and libidinous Parisienne family in the 1920's .... absolutely marvellous .... <br />To give you a flavour of the book, in the first story, Jeanne Takes A Lover' we find the young Christophe Brissard (some think this is the author's family) meeting the very married Jeanne Vernay (another well known Parisienne family) at a family dinner. Jeanne visits Christophe in his bedroom, after everyone went to bed, and our two lovers waste little time in tasting the fruits of the flesh. Jeanne however keeps warning Christophe that during his lovemaking he takes her to heights she has never been before and she is very scared. Their secret encounters continue while Christphe and jeanne slowly teach each other to let loose their inhibitions. <br />In Joie d'Amour we find a similar number of scrumptios short stories. In 'A Lesson for Bernard' a young Bernard Gaillard meets a married Simone Lebrun at a Brissard family dinner. Since taking a lover is such a very very French thing to do Simone and Bernard eventually find themselves together in bed where <BR>Simone is more intersted in using her hands to make love to Bernard than other parts of her body. Although she gives in to Bernards requirment to complete the sex act, Simone simply explains to him that this does not give her the ultimate <BR>pleasure she yearns for, but, she would just rather play with him using her hands. The young Bernard is so disconcerted he seeks the advice of more learned friends to be able to reconcile Simones wants and wishes to his desire to continue the clandestine affair.... <br />Wonderfull works of erotic literature I recommend any of Veillefranches book highly ....	2001-09-27

Actually I'm amazed he managed to get 345 pages of almost a single topic book together which is no mean feat in itself. <br />The book deals primarily with Max and his inspection tours of English boarding/reform schools and jails for young girls. He mostly tells the story of an abserver to the numerous stories of punishment with the exception of one story at the end of the book, 'The Travelling Man'. In that story he meets Maureen and they do have what one would consider normal sex since Maureen hopes that the punishment to be meted out will be light.

It has been some time since I had read this 'famous' book and found that it helped me at a time when I had a loss in the family. The book helped so much that even after some 20 years I can recall some of Dr Peale's suggestions and thoughts quite vividly. <br />I bought this tape to really give it to a friend who is quite depressed, and, not being sure that he would read the book decided to get it in tape. Unfortunately this is certainly not anywhere close to the content of the book. The tape has none of the rich anecdotes and wonderfull stories that the author used to put his point across in the book. <br />Not only is this tape abridged, but is simply and nothing more than a summary of the book.... and, it's depressed me even more than my friend that I was trying to help ....	2001-09-20

The book certainly reinforces the Vitorian mores of the time, which, were very strict in public but completely non-existent in private. <br />In part 1, seventeen year old Jane, decides to answer an ad from an employment agency for secretarial helpat an agency that is comitted to maintaining the girls while they await their placement. Needless to say Jane was immediately given to Col. James Barrington, a wealthy but finniky retired bachelor who teaches Jane that her duties are much more varied than just taking shorthand. He takes her virginity in a very detailed and gradual rape scene that takes most of half the book to describe... Very classic and excellently written ...<br />Part 2, we are introduced to a few of the other girls in the house and of course a few good men that were present at a peephole to see our Col. Barrington work his magic on Jane in Part 1 .... <br />The book is written making the reader appear to feel like an invisible observer to all the 'happenings' and in a style that I think would probably interest and tittilate the male reader as compared to the Black Lace series of erotic literature that is predominantly geared towards female readers ....	2001-09-18

In a letter of introduction from her mother to Julia, the mistress of Hardcastle is asked to take Astrid under her wing and teach her about the finer things in life the same way that she(Astrid's mom) was taught when she was young and willfull.<br />The lessons to be taught concern the classic Victorian specialties of subduing and controlling the males of the family with all sexual and sensual tools at their disposal, while at the same time consider it a sport of sexual intrigue to make all others around, you succumb to the basest and, most delicious desires of the flesh. <br />I absolutely love these kinds of books since although there is some domination and discipline, it is so gentle that it does not fall into the trap of being the more common 'whip me - beat me' type of book ..... A pleasant surprise considering some of the more recent published eortic stories that I have read ....	2001-09-13

WOW what a pleasant surprise ... and, trust me one has to snuflle through a lot of (junk) to find any new erotic literature from a US author that stands heads above the fray .... <br />'How I Adore You' is a series of seven distict stories, between 20 to 40 pages each, giving both the author and the reader sufficient time to develop the characters and the mini plots to make each story a delicious meal in itself. Mark Pritchard's writing style is smooth, captivating with an 'in your face' kind of earthiness that makes the reader feel like he's right there in the middle of the action. And what action there is, it comes at you in all flavours and touches those hidden delicious fantasies, that, although the reader may not ever actually participate in real life, but, to sit and watch ... ahhh there's the mastery of the author..... <br />The book starts with a very short story 'Lessons in Submission' that lets us wander into the mind of a young man painting a crystal clear mental portrait of a seduction of his submissive girfriend. The abslolutely amazing part of this story is that the author is able to tell this story without falling into that easy trap of turning the story into the kink of domination, discipline, and rape.....  <br />In 'Ordinary Story' we are introduced to a young black man, in San Fran, OF COURSE, troubled by an affair with Ron, who says that he has no problems with his homosexuality but that the does also have sex with one woman. Our hero has a problem with that and does not know if Ron is being truthfull in his feelings or if he is a bona fide bi-sexual. He discusses the issue with some of his friends in a conversation that is so well written I avtually thought I was sitting there with them. Our hero then decides to invite both Ron and his female sex partner, Pamela to dinner so that he can try to really understand Ron and this whole bi-sexual thing. Suffice it to say, the dinner was mind blowing and again, so real life I practically ripped the pages out of the book to get to the next part fo the story ... <br />Although it would be tempting to give you a flavour of all the stories,the coming of age story 'Incest' is probably my personal favorite, I must admit that this is a must have book for our erotic library to be enjoyed over and over ....	2001-09-09

Yes the concept of the book, a Victorian novel of a young girl married to a much older man, an unscrupulous publisher no less, led me to dish out the big bucks and buy this book .... <br />If they said this book was steamy, it certainly was, but, the steam came from me in having to read this mush. I think they should have announced this book as ANTI VICTORIAN literature since sensuality is hinted at but never touched. Thats why I rate this book with one star since you can't have serious relationships and marriage between people that are decades appart in age without some sort of spice.

The story then takes us through the afternoon of unbelievable carnal delights deliciously written and described...... The girls were certainly learners .... The book rates five stars and is a classic in erotic literature since the events are described in a most stupendous and gentle manner. Its probably one of the most expensive books however since it is after all a short story but a well worth addition to our erotic library... BTW .... You will probably find this book published in many different vesrions and compilations check ou the review of 'Lay of the Land' by Anonymous it includes Flappers and another bonus book ...	2001-08-26

This book as first published under the title of 'Between The Shadows And The Light' and credited to Anonymous in 1992. <br />Laura is certainly a classic Victorian era novel as we follow Laura through her travels visiting both friends and family as she remembers her exposure and loss of virginity. Surprisingly, I did not like this book because the author had a tendency to loose me, the reader, particularily during some of the most erotic scenes. This had the effect of confusing the visualizations that the readers should enjoy while reading erotic literature, rather than sticking to the task at hand. <br />It's really too bad since I was hoping to enjoy this Patrick Henden book as much as his other 5 star works such as; Lusts Labour Won (mind blowing) Eveline II, Katherine(prob one of his best works) and others .... As for the co-author, Edward Delauney, his masterful writin skill as shown in 'The Calamities of Jane' don't really show here either ... Sorry ....	2001-08-25

For the life of me I do not understand haw one single author, Patrick Henden, can write exotic erotic materpieces, like Lust's Labour Won and Eveline II, and the as well write books like Dorothea/Dancing Fawns. There may be two reasons, one he was getting paid by the word and the editors never read the books before publishing(explains these two books) or on the other hand maybe someone lost control of the 'meds' .... In any case, every Henden book I have bought I never know if I am going to get the master erotic writer OR am I going to get the one that thinks he's Elizabeth Bronte's brother .....

What a fabulous book of six stories set in Paris in the 1920's long before womens lib and at a time when made no bones (forgive the pun) about equality and keeping lovers just like their husbands might do. <br />Anne Marie Villefranche is an exciting writer (actually a pseudonym for an unknown to me British female author) and her erotic stories are actually interesteing. The discussions between the lovers have a point to them and show intelligence making the book an easy read. <br />The stories although told through the eyes of mostly the male hero, allows us to get the full flavour of the multifaceted female mind and her thoughts on sexuality, eroticism and all those oh so delicious sins of the flesh. <br />One of the best and most exquisite erotic short stores that I have ever read is in this collection, 'The Solicitude of Pauline Deveraux'. The story deals with a very young Roger  takinging his date Gisele home for the night. Gisele advises Roger in the taxi that her mother is out with her boyfriend, probably for the night, and she is now ready to allow his amourous advances finally reach their goal. Once at home and on the sofa doing what comes naturally, the two young lovebirds are surprised by Giseles mom, Pauline. Mom tells her daughter to go to the bedroom as she will deal with her in the morning, and she then sits down beside Roger to give her a piece of her mind, and, as we find out a lot of other things as well..... <br /> <BR>I loved this book and hope a reprint run is around the corner....	2001-08-18

This one is a prime example as it was published as two seperate novels making this an especially delious read for anyone that enjoys fine erotic writings. <br />The writings of Anne-Marie Villefranche, in contract to Victorian erotic novels are that the plots and sub-plots are much more complex and character development of the French seems paramount ... <br />There are two books in this novel .. The first SECRETS D'AMOUR  deals with Armand and Madelaine the wife of one of his friends. When one evening Madelaine brushes against him in a more FRIENDLY way than he expected the erotic story unfolds as Madeline decides to join that 'oh so French' group of women that decide they too will take lovers so as not to left behind by their husbands. This is a delicious story of love and betrayal. <br />The second book SOUVENIER D'AMOUR deals with Marcel and his love for the virginal Dany and the very beautiful but engaged Gabrielle .... Marcel has no trouble in allowing the women to have what they ultimately want. It's so delicious to read about women being the hunter without cheapening or shortening the excitement of the hunt. <br />The story is complex and bawdy enough to re-read it many many times ... Buy it before it goes out of print !	2001-08-18

This group is then joined by a young female, fully certified shaman, called Wolf, who comes from the 'thicks'. <br />Early in the book the reader discovers that Bat, concluding that his master shaman, who was suposedly killed by an earthquake, was probably murdered by someone not part of his 'thin' tribal group. He convinces both Skin and Wolf to join him in a search of the other tribes to uncover the murderer. The group of young shamans and apprentice shamans the journey through their know world to the other tribal groups to, ostensibly, discover the murderer, but, instead, what they do discover and explore is a growth of humanity and the foolishness of pre conceived notions of each tribes' difference from the other. <br />For regular Black Lace readers the elements of strong women taking control of their lives and sexuality are obvous in this book, but, unlike other books of this genre, Primal Skin is in itself a mind blowing action packed story that does not have to depend on the eroticism of the characters for the book to stand alone. In fact, the author manages to detail erotic sexual behaviour in a very basic almost animalistic manner that one would expect from pre-historic humans. I mean, after all their intelligence level has not yet developed to suchan extent that we could expect the eroticism of sex that is described in some of our Victorian classics. <br />For those readers that have read 'Neanderthal' this book has some of the same elements with none of the violence and a much much more of the delicious sex.<br />Finally, the sex in Primal Skin is so detailed and descriptive that certainly makes this an erotic book, but, it's that balance that the author presents in this story that makes this an unforgettable masterpiece that you won't easily put down.	2001-08-12

The plot of the whole story is very simple and is based on the rediscovered memoirs of a young 20 year old man that was forced to escape from England after working for some time as the second in command of a very special girls reformatory. The reformatory consisted of fifty to sixty young girls that were sent to be taught to behave in society by judges who acted as judge, prosecutor and jury. Needless to say, the reformatory also had benofactors that donated money for the priveledge of having some of the young girls given to them as slave labour after they finished their term, and, of course also be allowed to spend time at the reformatory to supervise and witness the girls punishment and 'education'. Oh yes, the judges as well were not remiss in their duties to pay regular visits to the reformatory. The book spends considerable time in describing the girls and then, of course, detailing the numerous spankings, beatings, whippings of naked rears. With access to many delicious young girls our hero took little advantage of them except for one anal sex scene that he just could not resist causing the eventual need for him and his friends to be forced to escape England. Matter of fact there is very very little sex in this book and that is why I warn the reader that you really have to have a thing for spanking and whipping to really enjoy this book.<br />Although this Edwardian erotica is not what I really enjoy, I must admit that even with the limited subject matterthe writing was good and very easy to read. Finally, I am certain, that I have read this whole story before, in another book, and by an author, not the famous Anonymous, but, I have not been able to find it in my little library....	2001-08-10

Fallen Woman deals with the memoirs of Louise, a young girl born in a small town in New York state who then moves to a big city school and then finally to France. <br />Louise makes no bones (forgive the pun) about her absolute delight in the sins of the flesh and as such generally sticks to (again) two men, Charley and Bob, and one woman, Nanette, in the book.<br />Bob is a young boy who Louise meets in her virginal youth as they spend a lot of time playing doctor in the bushes near her home. Bob is slightly older than Louise and he finally shows Louise how to get to third base in that game of life. Nanette is a prostitute who convinces Louise, disguised as a man, to go to a private session. When Nanette discovers her mistake she is wonderfully pleased and introduces out heroine to a lasting relationship of sapphic love. <br />One of the most delicious erotic scenes comes near the end of the book when Louise spies Charley and her black maid Clementina  in her bed. Those scenes and Louise's revenge absolutely sizzle .... <br />This is a well written rare example of early 1900's erotica set in the USA that I enjoyed thoroughly .....	2001-08-06

Julie, as well, of course, dedicates time to co-workers at the paper, and people she meets during her investigations, while making no apologies for loving every single moment. <br />If you enjoy reading books with a very high co-efficient of sluttishness then you'll love this book. Julie does not torment herself with self recrimination for the way she behaves and her absolute love of sex, so much so, that she continuously has to try to pace herself to avoid a scheduling conflict between the men and women she has affairs with. I thoroughly enjoyed the way she was portrayed by the author as being an 'in your face' kind of girl, which, I might add is hard to do.<br />Although this book is not as biting or as hard hitting as I would usually look for in my personal best erotica, as a whole I guess I'd say this book is 'erotica light' and a very easy read to while away a quiet rainy afternoon.	2001-08-03

Emily the heroine, or so to say, at the age of 20, oddly enough for the times, was a pure and innocent living with her sister Eveline and of course very libertine mother and father. Having reached that magic age, accoring to the rules, Emily,is from one moment to the next, basically rocketed into an erotic and sexual world by her sister, a couple of visitors and her father. Of course, it is after all a Victorian novel of a time when incestuous type of relationships were not considered a crime and the practice was only condemmed by the ecclesiastic community.<br />With her family's fortune is waning, Emily's mother and father arrange for her to marry the wealthy neighbour's son so that she can get an allowance from her father-in-law that can be passed back to her family. Of course Emily's husband, Arnold, having lived with his parents and two very very 'active' sisters is for some reason described as a rather whimpy type, lacking in much  free will and wanting in the physical attribute dept. <br />Considering what mommy and sisters do with poor Arnold since he was a young boy I guess you'd probably come to the conclusion he's dead tired rather than whimpy!<br />In any case, Emily is of course seduced in this book as she discovers that everyone in the community seems to be having sex with each other and that there are a whole bunch of unwritten rules that they follow in their sexual pursuits. <br />The book is light on spanking and whippings (thank goodness) but those strange rules that seemed to make a lot of sense to the characters are continuously mentioned at the beginning of the book.<br />The main problem with the book was that even though there's sex from cover to cover I never got the feeling, while reading, that I was either a willing or an unwilling participant of the action. The sex is there the eroticism of the moment isn't.	2001-07-27

The loss of her innocence, unplanned pregnancy and ultimate marriage to Jason is real life in action today. <br />From this detailed walk down memory lane we are transported to the present day as Zoe finds herself in her 'yuppie' or should we say 'buppie' world of house, kid, mortgage, great husband BUT unfulfilled sexual twitches. The pursuit and capture of Zoe by Quentin is absolutely delicious, and again written with the skill of a master. You could almost feel like you were there as Zoe, because of her work, finds herself alome with her new lover and behaves like a doe caught in the headlights. <br />The level of erotica in 'Addicted' would be considered as relatively tame using the Victorian or Edwardion erotica standards so I can't really say that the book is a sizzler by any stretch of the imagination, but, that notwithstanding this is a great book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. Well done sista ... one bitchin book ... ooops did I really say that ....	2001-07-26

Although there is sex, violence, intrigue, adventure, etc etc I feel they are just a backdrop to the  authors gentle decription of a style of life and working experience. <br />In this book, our hero, Brian is tricked back to Taiwan from his career as one of the working board members of a small publishing house. The letter, supposedly signed by his widdowed sister-in-law asks him for help at a moment when he had just convinced his company to send him to Tailand and the Far East to find unpublished authors and printers for a new series of books.  Brian, at 45 or so, takes a trip back into time to meet with a part of his life that over the years of the 'hum drum' Western business had fogged over in his memory. While there, he meets up with a cast of colourfull characters that unflinchingly seem trapped in the late 1960's. <br />While there Brian manages to taste the fruits of Tailand, and by that I mean more than the pineapples, as he is asked by his siter-in-law to help get his 25 year old niece, Nalin, out of  one of Bankok's more notorious 'strip clubs' the 'Horny Tiger'.  I must admit that this book is written very much from a 'male' point of view and from the point of view of a business mercenary as he is forced to work in an exotic environment. The cast of characters are described with such knowledge that anyone who has ever found himself thrust into that life will immediately identify with bioth the characters and the settings. It certainly took me back, and, Barnett's perception of the large contingent of Brit ex-pats, and mid western good ole boys,  stranded all over the world, made melaugh and smile in  quiet agreement. <br />Although there is a story, there is a plot and there is adventure, this reader can not help but feel they take a secondary place to meeting the characters and enjoying a drink and the scenery of the 'Horny Tiger'. I would have enjoyed the  book A LOT MORE if the author would have spiced up the sex scenes with his obvious mastery of erotic lit, as in 'Mistress of the East' a fab historical erotic novel .... then I guess I would have had to rate this book as a ten star novel...	2001-07-23

I have rated this book as a five star special only because I guess it was written for a very specific reader. <br />First, the book is divided into three main sections, by month, from October to December, and based on the title, it's Paris 1941, during the German occupation. <br />The main characters, Simone and Nicole, two young Parisienne women who are being kept by men for their own distinct resons and wants. Nicole is single and is having an affair with Bernard Duchene, the husband of Simone, while Simone is having affairs with a never ending litany of German soldiers....neither of the women know each other. The oddest thing is that these two women are doing the 'horizontal two step' only because they really really like it, not because of any greater good for the resistance or money or fear or basically anything except that they really really like it!<br />Why is this book odd, well, first I'd be highly surprised to learn that the author is anything but a true blue German. The book is written with meticulous, and I mean meticulous care in describing exactly what we see, where we are, what the characters are wearing, and abnormal descriptive detail to the exact loaction of hands and body parts. For every scene and even the auther takes a page or two to describe exactly what we see...<br />Simone has a thing, and I mean a big thing, for German uniforms and leather boots, and I thnk that if you were wearing one of these uniforms she'd be open to do anything, particularily if you keep the uniform on. Simone also has numerous mastubatory experiences on a soldiers boot, dreaming of Hitler ... and so on<br />That brings us to the second main thing in that the book contains a full and detailed description of at least 10 pages of all the German military uniforms.... ranks and insignias. To make matters even better, Simones' husband, Bernard, has a factory that, can ya believe it, wants to manufacture German uniforms, and, since Bernard is sleeping with Nicole, heck he doesn't even know his wife has a thing for the uniforms .... WOW<br />What concerns me the most is that I actually finished this book, HMMMMM, but, all that notwitshtanding this book are not what I would generally read but it is so specifically wierd (in my mind that is) that it deserves five stars for those of you that may be into it ....	2001-07-19

Since Kate was getting bored with her job, and decided she would resign anyway, she decided to make it one seminar that not only will get her motivational points across, be a heck of a lot of sexual fun, and, will never be forgotten by the participants...<br />To say that the seminar was successfull would be an understatement as the three men, one woman and Kate explore a lot more than the do's and dont's of assertiveness training.<br />It'as an easy going book with a lot of sex, a simple and straight foreward plot with a lot of basic straight foreward sex.<br />Juliet Hastings is the same author that wrote 'The Hand of Amun'  and I really have to admit it's hard to believe that the same person wrote these two books. The 'Hand' is a mind blowing fabulous erotic book that is complicated and shows master writing skills and any comparison between these two books would be like comparing a bycicle to a Rolls.	2001-07-17

Can't get into what they do in this review but, suffice it to say it ain't pretty, and it's not erotic for this reader. <br />Heinrich of course is a crazy sadist who is awaiting a delgate from the devil himself, in the form of a couple of supposed magicians that I think are over 250 years old, Karolan and Garnetta,  so he can I guess be validated as one of the devils leaders on earth... <br />By the time I hit page 84 we get introduced to another, of numerous characters, Adalberta, the wife of Baron Otto. To give you a flaour of the book the first sentences of Chapter 5 go something like this:&quot;She wrinkled her nose in disgust. The sheets smelt of her husband's sour body and were blotched with patches of drying semen, evidence of his renowned sexual prowess.&quot;<br />That did it for me .. sorry ... had enough .. the book up to this point made ample use of words such as rotten, putrid, sour, puss filled, transmuted flesh, burnt meat, etc etc that I really couldn't take it any more and this is one book I am probably never going to finish it ... <br />Why the 5 star rating?

This is the kind of Richard Manton book that first grabs your mind as it takes you back in history, then grabs your throat as the story develops and finally, grabs your ... (oh well anyway)... as you the reader are trapped into being a witness and willing accomplice to seduction and total submission of our heroine inot sins of the flesh. <br />In part one, Beauty and the Beast, we find our high strung heroine, Jenny Langham, a very beautifull young 22 year old English girl in the early 1900's, forcing herself to accompany her uncle, and officer in the British Forces, to Khartoum, Sudan, to escape the horror of almost being raped by her then fiancee. The author does allow us the momentary relief to admire Leslie and dislike the cad of a fiancee even though we know that she is a brazen flirt...... <br />Part two, Khatoum, finds our heroine with a full complement of British and European ex-patriot society as they must deal with the threat of attack by a nomad moslem leader calling himself the 'Mahdi'. The Brits having lost their stomach for empire maintenance sent a General Gordon to make peace with the Mahdi and try to make a gracefull exit from the African country. Without delving into the great historical period fiction with many real world political leaders of the time being written in, we find Leslie continuing her flirtations and teasings of the men around her. As a reader our frustration begin to rise in a secret hope that Leslie must soon receive her just deserts ... at least ....  <br />Part three, The Woman and Her Master, Khartoum falls so quickly that all of the men woman and children of the ex-patriate society fall into the hands of the Mahdi. In the flash of an eye we now find Jennys' strong headed willfullness and incessant teasing dealt with by her new masters. The induction of our young heroine into the harem of the new leaders is written with such skill and mastery that it's hard to believe we are only reading fiction. The eroticism of Jennys' conversion to slavery is the best that I have ever read and sizzles .... so much so I actually don't really wonder any more about the source of Richard Mantons' background experience and material .... <br />In the afterword, The Horrors of the Harem, the author treats us with a bit of self serving advertisement of some of the other slave/harmen books he has written, but, more importantly place before the reader some historical truths about the topic of this book that will make your hair stand on end, unless, perhaps, the reader has travelled through some of the countries in the dark continent. <br />Absolutely stupendous and this book is a must have for your erotic library ......	2001-07-14

Since Freddie was the younger brother with no real inheritance, and on top of that, was now the talk of the town, in relation to his sexual preferences, the finding of a suitable society wife was no mean task to say the least. <br />In walks our heroine, Florence, the only daughter of a humble vicar left with barely enough inheritance to survive for a few more years. Florence decides to hire a lawyer, take her inheritance and invest it into a search for a suitable husband that would be able to maintain her for the rest of her life. <br />The perfect solution for Edward and his problem in getting Freddie married off.... and ... like all simple plans of mice and men, Edward was having problems controlling himself from the first moment hey laid eyes on Florence.  <br />The book takes us through a romantic stroll as Florence is introduced into London society, as a long lost cousin of Edward and Freddie, by the reigning queen of the social circles, Edward's Aunt, Hypatia. In true romance novel fashion, the author spends a great deal of time setting up the characters as we witness the utter frustration of watching Edward begin to realize that maybe his brother was getting the better part of this deal. <br />The moment of 'awakening' for Edward and Florence is so well written being both tender and filled with love lust that the pages verily sizzle, and, if there is anyone that can do that and make it seem that you are there and living the experience, it's Emma Holly .... <br />I must say that this is the first romance book that I have read that is also an erotic masterpiece......	2001-07-13

This is the first of Portia Da Costa's books I have read and the first 11 pages of the books Prologue are so hot that it was worth the price of the book for me. The Prologue details the plot where our hero, the count Andre, at his engagement (betrothal at that time) party to his beloved virginal Belle, meets the evil, but oh so delicious, countess Isidora. <br />Sizzling love is made, spells are cast and, in Chapter one,  we are thrust into the future where Andre and Belle are trapped to meet up with Belinda and Johnathan, a young couple who lost their way on a dark and backwoods road. Our young couple abandon their car and find refuge in what appeared to be an abandoned priory hidden away in the middle of nowhere. Our cast of characters are revived to while away the days surrendering to the most base, and erotically yummie, desires of the flesh. <br />The erotic sex is fantastic and superbly written and it's little wonder you'll have trouble finding any of this author's books in stock because most of them will be hidden away to be read at those most private of moments.	2001-07-12

What a pleasant surprise, a Marcus Von Heller book from a 1992 publishing run by Carroll &amp; Graf publishing that hasn't been snapped up for reprint by the new erotic powerhouses such as Blue Moon or Virgin publishing. <br />The book is a sensitive (relatively speaking) erotic tale of a young 20 yr old boy living in a small backwoods coastal village in modern Spain. Our hero, Avelino, with the strict, simple and religious small town upbringing meets up with Janice, a single 30ish tourist that has come to the small town to enjoy the local flavour. And, enjoy the local flavour she does as our hero scales cliffs in order to spy on her sunbathing in the nude every afternoon. Avinio finally makes himself known to Janice and she wastes no time in aleviating him of both his curiosity and his virginity. (I have to admit that I was a little skeptical at this point that he managed to maintain his purity in an environment where even Quasimodo can find a good looking girlfriend)<br />Since little escapes the small town folk and his parents, Avinio is told that he has disgraced his family forcing him to accept Janice's prodding and invitation to accompany her to Barcelona to live with her and enjoy the bright lights and city life. <br />In Barcelona, Avinio meets some more of Janice's friends and followers and manages to maintain a perspective on his life as he now has more and more women fawning over him and leading him on a path of .... well we can't get into that here ...<br />As in all good erotic novels, there is a story to be told and a plot to follow. We follow our hero into the big city and into the beds of what I would consider some very interesting women until he runs amok of some of Janice's seedier friends. <br />The book is a very easy read and even though I may not have liked the saccarine sweet ending, (usually a slap in the face when you're reading erotic lit) but, by the time I got to that part of the book I was more than satisfied with the story.<br />For thefirst time reader of erotic lit to the seasoned pro this is an enjoyable book ....	2001-07-11

If you have ever harboured the hidden fantasies of being a biker chick and being raped, then this book will give you both, for the price of one. <br />Laura, is a very very beautifull 19 year old who is forced to live with the politically powerfull executor of her father's million dollar will, until she reaches the age of majority. The story is set in modern times in the hinterlands of the UK but it could quite well have been anywhere in the US as well. The plot has an element of revenge, since the housekeeper, Cassandra, wants to wreak havoc on the life of Laura's guardian because he uncallously fired her totally innocent father, the butler. Having nowhere to go, Cassandra continues to work in the secret hope that at some future date she will be able to revenge her father's demise. <br />Cassandra's she sweet revenge quickly took the form of seducing and then teaching Laura to be no more than an uncontrolled and  wanton nympho to be led into a series of gradually more deliciously degrading scenes to be used, and abused, by an ever increasing number men.<br />I found the plot is not of foremost importance in this book but the action is. The author takes us on a wild wild ride as Laura is led on a path of self discovery by the scheming Cassandra. The first half of the book is stupendous and highly erotic as the author demonstrates her skills in that oh so sweet seduction and inevitably mind blowing submission by our heroine. In the last half of the book Laura ends up with a small biker gang who continue to treat her as a sex slave, unfortunately, 'ad nauseum'. <br />I have not read any of Lia Anderson's three other books,but, I get the distict impressions she likes the bike gang sex slave fantasy as an underlying theme for much of her writings. Although I didn't like the biker part of this book (not one of my things as they say) I rated this one as a five star winner because the first part describing the submission of Laura is out of this world, very erotic and superdelicious.	2001-07-10

Hilary Blair living in Paris discovers her husband, Walter, enjoying the sweetness of one of the many maids in their house. Although shocked at first her emotions go from disgust, to anger, to hate and then revenge.         Although she never really goes through that agonizing introspection that many authors seem to beat to death, the readers sees the gentle transformation in Hilary's mind as we are seduced into acompaniying our heronie on her quest for revenge that unexpectedly turns into self discovery.        Hilary really never jumps on that recriminatory roller coaster of emotion as she describes perfectly, with stunning clarity and simplicity, her sexual awakening with an ever increasing circle of friends and aquaintances. One can easily identify with the thoughts in Hilary's mind as she describes her hesitation, and nervousness while experiencing erotic and sexual trysts.         For those that may have read my other reviews, this book does not have the hard hitting erotica that I generally enjoy, but, it's a wonderfull book equisitely written by a master and certainly should be calssified as a Blue Moon classic.	2001-07-10

Patrick Henden one the top rated Victorian writers authored this book with ALL the trappings of a wonderful Victorian erotic novel, lot's of young girls, wealthy families with nothing better to do than sleep with each other, fathers with a hunger for their daughters and mothers with a hunger for absolutely everyone, and last but not least an obligatory spanking before the act. All of that notwithstanding, I have to say that I really couldn't realte to the main character Miriam. Even after I finished the book I was not really sure if she really enjoyed the erotic rainbow to which she was subjected, or, perhaps, in the book, she never really is capable of expressing her pleasure. Alina, the companion and tutor from a girls private school, is the other main character as she pushes Miriam into varying sitautions and encourages her sexual education. She, as well, doesn't really get a chance to do more than express her absolute joy and enthusiam for sex, without ever getting into the details, for which the Vitorians are renowned. I am afraid, in retrospect, that both girls are written as being pretty darned stupid leaving them incpabale of any expressions to please the reader. Another issue, the concept of repeated, ad nauseum, whippings and spankings becomes more and more tediuos, proabably even readers that enjoys erotic spankings will get to the point in this bok to say 'enough is enough'. I mean if you get whipped and spanked before EVERY sexual encounter, well, the intended effect of the delicious punishment then just becomes part of a 'ho hum' ritual not really an erotic juicy episode. There is no real pursuit and capture, no seduction, no submission, and finally also no real growth of the characters in this book just, well you know, plain boilerplate, cookie cutter erotic elements .....

Tristran and Calire are childhood friends and he became obsessed with her after another girl, like in grade 3, told him she didn't like him because he was such a whimp. Darn was that girl right because Tris never was able to recover from that childhood rebuff. ... <br />Claire, of course, was very flighty and really should be considered as the poster girl for superficiality as she goes out to the local pub for the 'hunt'. .... Now that would have at least been one erotic scene mixed up with all the Saturday night, slightly drunk, wondering if he'll still like me, ... scenes that the author serves up like corned beef & hash. <br />Sorry, hard as I tried to like this book, I mean it ain't cheap, I want eroticism not the life story ....	2001-06-30

The absolutely tantalizing thing about erotic stories is the illicitness of sex, the sin of it, and the delicious chase, seduction and final submission.

In the 185 pages of this book there is no reference of any kind to any man or male whatsoever. That makes this a first in my book. The story deals with an elederly, greying, slightly pudgy wealthy woman, Thea, who learns that her young maid, Yvette, is leaving because she can not find fulfillement for her dominant fantasies in the home of Thea. In a panic that she may loose the lovely Yvette, the mistress of the house agrees to buy her a slave from a special school of training. <br />Needless to say, I am convinced that the author must run an obedience school for dogs because the slaves are trained exactly the same as their four legged friends would have been. <br />Appart from the obvious sapphic excercises in this book a lot of the sex is bathroom related, I guess the girls at this school  aren't given much to drink that comes in a glass. <br />Not to say there isn't a market for these books but I mean this book has gone over the top for kink writing ....	2001-06-29

The good news is that this is one 'fab' book, the bad news is that I already own it and read it when I was sweeter and younger. <br />For those of you that have been reading erotic lit from the time you had to scrounge through bookstores to find one that they ordered by mistake, I read this book about 20 years ago under the title of 'Venus in the Country - A Novel of Victorian England' published by my heros, the Grove Press... <br />The book was published under the moniker of Anonymous and lists that it was first published in 1895 by 'Members of the Society of Priapus...<br />The book deals with Pamela an 18 year old housekeeper of Mr & Mrs Rumple, landed gentry in Victorian England. Mrs. Rumple one day decides that Pamela at 18 was a little too frisky for her and that she should be sent off to work in the city while they get another housekeepr. They secretly make the arrangements to get Pamela a job as a governess in the city and the day before she leaves Mr. Rumple decides that now was the time for Pamela to be 'inspected' and also 'injected'.... <br />Pamela certaily did like the 'injection'  and goes out of her way to make sure she gets as many of these 'vaccinations' that she can . Pamela starts to work at the home of Richard and Belinda Bromely to care for her two daughters Miranda and Helen and their son Ronald. With nothing much to do, I guess, avoiding incest was one thing that certainly was not high on their list of priorities.<br />In this book, we also get a look into the lives of the vicar Edward Hart and his sister Edna as they finally discover that having lived together for all of their spinster lives there were a lot of fun things that they could have been doing though they years had they not been so shy. Well forget about shyness they certainly lost it and more in this book. The scenes described here are so so so erotic that I have never been able to get them out of my mind .... <br />If you love erotic lit then this is one of the best. Im glad I found a new copy because the paper that they use in these books starts to fade and disappear after 20 something years .... <br />A must have for your little erotic lit library ....	2001-06-26

Now Vanessa lives in the country home with only her brother and a very very willing young maid, Mary.

OK so I gave it two stars rather than one since I did finish the book no matter what. Maybe dumb is giving Jane too much credit she's actually quite stupid. <br />As the ed synopsis of this book says Jane is in a bit of a bind since her next door neighbour found hard-core pics of her when she was a teenager. So, this neighbour, Den, who I disliked from the get go as a major looser, gets Jane to do some of the most wonderful five star things imaginable. The other two major characters are Mat, her husband and Lisa the lesbian teenage friend of Den. <br />To sum up the WHOLE book, which basically takes place in the UK suburbs in two neighbouring homes, Den gets into Janes house, shows her the pics and threatens to tell her dumb husband Mat, then Jane strips and they have sex. Without counting, I think Den and Lisa told Jane at least 150 times that they were going to spill the beans to Mat, they also beieved that Jane was stupid so they had to keep on reminding her why she was tied up spreadeagle alloing a whole bunch of dumb people doing things to her. <br />By the way the scenes with the wood fence and a large knothole were probably written into the book to appease the readers with a bent for gardening?<br />Anyway, the fact that Mat always showed up just after one of these scenes never seemed strange to Jane (remember shes very very stupid) until three quarters through the book when she sees his shoes through her blindfold as he was ... well you know .... <br />Since the gig was up on using Jane with that dumb excuse they then said that they were going to show her hard-core pics to Jane's mother! puleeeeeeeze <br />I don't want to spoil the surprise to those readers that are going to buy this book so I won't tell you about Jane taking on whole neighbourhoods of men in the latter part of the book. <br />There is a basic premise that for a book to be erotic some minimal level of intelligence must be displayed by the characters otherwise it may as well be letters written to a porno magazine ....	2001-06-20

One thing I can say for Blue Moon Books they certainly are not afraid of treading into unknown territory. This is one of those examples and what I found to be one unbelievably awfull book. <br />The story deals with Majorie who on being separated from her husband finds that she must live through the trials and tribulations of life while she raises her young daughter.  Majorie hooks up with Luke who abuses her throughout the whole book as we get their disjointed and intellectually wanting thoughts and feelings described in tortuous detail, over and over. <br />As a highlight, and I guess to add realism, we are also treated to a detailed description of Majorie beating the daylights out of her loving dog to somehow tell the reader she is frustrated  with her life. Talk about gratuitous violence since the dog only appears there to be beat senseless and taken to a hospital.<br />The book is really in my mind unble to ever make ANY scene (even with the free use of drugs, whorish girlfriends etc etc)remotely erotic. <br />There IS an intellectual requirement both of the reader and the author for the book to be classed as erotic, in this case,  I think I now have a new standard of trash literature for my future reviews.	2001-06-20

In this superb novel published in 2000 by our friends at Blue Moon we find Jeremy a twenties or something young man living in Britain of today with a total obsession for erotic spankings. So much so that he really does very little else, which I must add leaves me, as the reader observer, pretty well cold and totally, totally frustrated.<br />The ed reviews describe Jeremy as 'a bedroom sadist' which I think may be a little over the top and harsh since certainly there are many real sadist books out there that would make your hair curl. No I wouldn't call him a sadist since Manton develops his character in twelve linked 'narratives' where Jeremy finds his sometimes reluctant victims and allows them to develop the plot with the inevitable spanking/delicious punishment episode for some real or imaginary wrong.<br />The spanking scenes are stupendous, well written and so detailed and concise that really will please the reader who is 'into' that kind of thing. In a chapter titled 'The Homicidal Humorists' Jermey, Joanne and Cat are detained in the Spanish mountains on their way to Port Xanthra. While in custody Joanne 'lets her fingers do the walking' in one of the best self pleasuring scenes that covers almost nine pages for goodness sakes.<br />Oh well, even though this is not the kind of Manton book that I really enjoy I do rate it as 5 stars since its a masterfull work for those readers that enjoy erotic spankings .....	2001-06-17

At this point lesley is just very very content being allowed to explore her sexuality with total abandon after having left her probably British husband and two little children to explore and expand her sensual side. <br />The second part of the book deals with Leslie and the rest of the happy group on the train trip to Florville and finally to the villa itself. It is here that Lesley discovers that the women are just captives of their own wants and desires and that although they are now being treated as posessions, their desire for both male and female passions keeps them de facto prisoners of Kurt, Hassan et al. <br />Finally, Claire who runs what is no more and no less than a white sex slave ring in 'Hungary?' appears on the scene and eventually takes posession of all the women brought to Florville by Kurt. Calire embarks and the final lessons of submission and trains them for ultimate sale to wealthy men of means. <br />Lesley of course finds little time to think of escape, though she does to some extent complain, and ultimately finds herself a slave to her own body and her body's unquenchable desire. The author takes the reader gently down that slippery slope as we watch and vicariously enjoy Lesleys' total surrender and ultimate ravishing and abandonment. <br />The editorial review does little justice to this incredibly eroticBlue Moon book that certainly would entice any readers who harbour those delicious rape and submission fantasies. <br />Definitely a MUST HAVE for your erotic library ....	2001-06-16

The book is geared to Edwardian rather than Victorian erotic writing and as such has the tendency to take a third party view of the 'action' so to say, relishes both punishment, and invariably bondage, as part of the sex act. The fact that usually the females are unwilling participants seems to add to the spice and flavour of the Edwardian mentality. <br />The book is a series of letters between 'Jack' in Britain and 'Dolly' in Germany and their very private schools for young ladies of society. Both decide to send girls to each other for education and 'training' while Jack and Dolly correspond of the progress of the pupils. Suffice it to say that the girls are subjected to more than the cane on their bare bottoms.....<br />After having read and reviewed 'Deep South' and 'Bombay Bound' by Richard Manton, and having rated them as as 5 star books, I can't really say that I liked 'Aphrodizza' very much, BUT, then again this book wasn't written for me. <br />So, read the reviews of this book and you certainly should get a good idea of its content, style of writing, and if you would rate it as a 5 or 1 star special for your particular likes and dislikes.	2001-06-14

The author prefaces with the title of PhD and a 'lecturer in Arabic studies', and, in effect, the book is perhaps a discussion of Arabic studies. <br />The book is a series of 13 stories, based on anecdotes or rediscovered writings of people that have experienced life in the desert among the Arabs and followers of Bani Odra. The stories as such, of course have little character development and basically follow the same inexorable theme. Girl gets, either kidnapped, or, runs away and finds herself with numerous men in the desert to loose her virginity. Unknown 'natural' drugs and potions are used in most of the deflowerings, and I, as the reader, get the feeling of nothing either pleasurable or erotic about any of the couplings.

Well, maybe I shouldn't have been totally surprised since Blue Moon seems to find books that are teetering on the edge and the reader never really knows what to expect. <br />This book is a fictional account based on fact and history in China in the 1860's while China was in the middle of innumerable wars and conflicts for its riches and wealth. <br />Considering that at the time the birth of a female to a chinese family was nothing to celebrate, an army of young women 'Christian' called the 'Taiping' formed to battle with both foreign mercenary armies and Chinese armies for control of the country. One of these bands of zealous agressive and fierce fighters captured a young American officer, 'Thomas Rowley' who was then given to the 19 year old 'Sweet Little Sister' as her slave.<br />Rowley describes his ordeal and his eventual submission to the will of the little soldiers. It must be noted that the author spends more time on the adventure of the tale rather than the erotic content one may have expected from Blue Moon .. <br />I gobbled up the book in one reading and, like all good books, felt disappointed when it was finished ....	2001-06-09

This book has all the appearences of being a Harlequin type romance novel that no one wanted to publish. Why, well first of all the supposed religious retreat is called 'Heavens Gate' and those of us that are familiar with the real Heavens Gate thing in the usa with DO and RE and MI, the leaders brings visions of simpleton idiots that were waiting for their spaceship to come. Nothing and I  mean NOTHING erotic about that, matter of fact, every time I read the reference to Heavens Gate it jerked me into a reality I hope to escape from while reading an erotic book. <br />Contrary to the main Black Lace themes of strong women taking what they want out of life, the heroine in this book, Mary Grace, does little to show any strength and is a far cry from  other heriones in the genre.

I you are into rape and very violent erotic sex with a revengefull twist then this book is for you. Be forewarned however that there is barely one erotic sexual encounter where the sexual partners are willing from the get go, and, this scene is more like a backdrop rather than an integral part of the story. <br />As if that isn't bad enuogh the author also devotes considerable time to BM's and that type of sex. Certainly the editorial review would lead you to belive this is a Victorian era erotic book. Well it's not! The only Victorian thing about this book is the time frame of the book and that's where it ends!<br />I rated it as five stars even though, as you can probably tell, I didn't like the book because there are readers that enjoy this type of pretty rough eroticism.	2001-05-29

There are two books in this volume. <br />The Lay of the Land is a story of the young bride Glayds having to fend for herself in Victorian times England. Fortunately for Glayds she has two very strong points in her favour, One, she is a realy young beauty and two, she loves, and I mean, really loves men. Of course appart from loving what men do to her she also loves what they give her, over and over. This anonymous book is well written though not really exceptional in my mind .....<br />The second book in this volume is 'Two Flappers in Paris' and this IS one classical masterpiece. So much so it has been published and re-published under it's own title .... I have reviewed this book as a five star Very hot little story as follows ...<br />I first read a sizeablbe excerpt of this in a Playboy edition a few years back ... A young British diplomat meets a young girl on her way to a French boarding school while crossing the English Chanel on arough and story voyage .... <br />It becomes clear imeadiately that the young girl, although innocent, is looking to learn quickly about the finer things in life and was just a little disappointed that when she arrives at the school she can not be inducted into the senior girls lesbian society until she reaches her senior year.... <br />Our young diplomat, Jack, being fast in mind and body then sets up a plan to take the young girl and a friend,since no one can leave the chool without a chaperone, on an afternoon trip of delights by posing as her uncle Jack ... <br />The story then takes us through the afternoon of unbelievable carnal delights deliciously written and described...... The girls were certainly learners .... <br />The book rates five stars and is a classic in erotic literature since the events are described in a most stupendous and gentle manner. Its probably one of the most expensive books however since it is after all a short story but a well worth addition to our erotic library...	2001-05-29

Holly Graham spins a very tight story in a Scandalous Affair that provides us with well rounded characters and a plot that does not drag but fairly sizzles.  To be a good book many autors seem to forget that it has to make sense and it has to flow. You can not just take a book and then superimpose some gratuitous erotic scenes. Ms Graham wrote this novel as erotic lit from day one and that is why I love it! The main character, Olivia, wife of an MP in the UK finds out that she is just a 'trophy wife' and that her philandering adultrous husband has continued his propensity to enjoy sex as an extracurricular activity. Without too much soul searching Olivia decides 'whats good for the goose is .... ' well you now, and she strikes out revenge herself and ultimaelty make him pay. To do that she decides that she too must learn to enjoy the juicy fruits of stolen love.

Drug userers are not magnanimous .. you don't want any, good, they aren't going to force you, cause it means more for them. <br />Number one, heroin kills, and number two, kills all sex urges so the rape scene by addicts is ridiculous.

After barely getting intoduced to Carolyn, one on the other characters in the book, that we find her having sex in the parking lot of the coffee shop and feed store where they pick up supplies for the working weekend .<br />Although it's nice to get into the sex part of the book early, if we are slapped in the face with it in unreal type of situations it crosses the line from eroticism into porn. <br />Needelss to say once at the ranch everyone pairs and re-pairs while the writer interjects the plot (oh yes the fink in the corporation) as an afterthought to the actions and goings on ....<br />Sorry this book just isn't what I expected from one of todays' premiere erotic fiction writers....	2001-04-23

'of I usually become apprehensive, but, I decided to take the plunge and kick out the bucks to buy this book. What a disappointment!! <br />On reading the 30 short stories (can't believe I got through them all) many of them entail stories that must have been taken from 'The Best Gay Erotica' since it deals with boys doing what they do when they are alone. Matter of fact, sadly enough, the ONLY stories that were to any extent even slightly erotic were the 'boys will be boys' stories ... <br />In the first story 'Innocence in Extremis' we get 3 pages of a 28 year old virgin describing her frustrations with any relationship except her fingers. <br />The second story 'Space Girls are Easy' a young man is kidnapped by good looking green women with antenna that use manuals like 'The Whole Earth Catalogue' which also came with abduct-o-matic, and bind-a-bean tape and fasteners to hold down the earthlings they want to have sex with.<br />'The Maltese Dildo' is a story about a private detective finding a dildo that had a jewelled handle... it's a boy boy story that was aaahhhhemmmm penetratiing to say the least ..<br />'Triple X' is a story of a young girl in the South going to X rated theaters because it's the only place she could find AC. 'A hand rests on a swollen breast, thighs open like a bible' is about as erotic as this stupid story gets....LOL <br />'Sophies Smoke' is a hoot. This is a story about Sophie and a young man in a humidor closet doing things with cigars that would make Clinton proud.<br />'Calcutta' story of two boys in a steam room, nuf said OK ... <br />'S&amp;M'A two page story of a girl wanting to be taken by the back door and be spanked. The story can't have more than 125 words for goodness sakes, I'm sure it was first written on a cocktail napkin!.<br />'Somewhere I have Never Travelled' is a story of a young girl in Japan being trained in the martial arts. She has the hots for her master and the only erotic sex that takes place her is that one drop of sewat hits her from his face, and after she breaks her leg in sparring, he kisses the instep of her good foot. Can't say it makes me tingle....<br />OK thats only the first 8 stories and not a hetero sexual erotic story in the bunch .. from here it goes down hill till, oh ya gotta love this one, we get to 'Rebecca' which is a story about Siamese twins joined at the head and one of them wants to, you know diddle the boyfriend Remus. I won't even get into their discussion at the hairdressers while they decide how to cut and trim their hair .... <br />OK so if any of these stories turn you on and you find joined siamese twin, cigar munching, alien sex, with heavy emphasis on homesexual couplings as erotic, and exciting, then this book is for you .... otherwise save your money .... <br />Finally, as if that ain't enuf, there isn't a mainstream published American erotic writer in the bunch of them ...

Somewhat atypical of the Black Lace series of books that deal with strong women that live hard, work hard and play hard, the Hands of Amun deal with a strong woman that seems to be taken along a path and adventure that was pre-destined for her in ancient Egypt. <br />The main character Naunakhte, a beautifull young girl living in a humble village on the Nile with her adoptive parents, hopes that one day she will be able to discover the truth about her real birth parents and origins. The story starts with her quite unexpectedly being summoned to the temple of Amun to be presented to the high priest and pristess and to take her place as one of the servants of the Egytian god Amun.<br />The temple of Amun is a very powerfull sect and Amun represents the power of the libido and fertility to the people of then Egypt. Naunakhte is thrust into her new life having no experience with the politics of the members of the temple where she discovers she has powerfull friends and enemies from day one. Being of a very sensous nature from birth, Naunakhte  has no difficulty fitting into the highly erotic daily life of a loyal follower and she immediately believes that she was predestined to be the favorite of the god Amun.<br />Don't think that this is a story of a poor little girl that finds out she was born to wealth and brings her parents to live happily ever after since Naunakthe get entagled in the scheming of her enemies and soon finds herself alone again having to use her wits and wiles just to keep alive. <br />As in any great book of the genre the eroticism is totally a part of the story and integral to the development of the characters, the plot and the scene of ancient Egypt. It is so masterfully written that the reader feels he/she is there in the temple with the followers of Amun and one can practically smell the soft scented oils, balms  and perfumes used during their exquisite rituals.<br />If you can appreciate the mystery of ancient Egypt,the sensuality of the people and the intrigue of a great story then  you will certainly devour this book.	2001-04-17

The book deals with a young restaurant owner, Venetia Halliday, Venny, as she tries to keep her struggling establishment open. The fact that Venny has the business sense not to sleep with the help she manages to break that rule with prctically everyone in the restaurant except the valet (and thats only because the restaurant didn't have a valet)! I didn't like this book(how can ya tell) because Venny gets intimate with everyone including men she really doenst like. I knew I was in trouble when in the first 18 pages she gets it on with Bill, her chef, and after doing the goodie she fires him! I mean we may not be looking for love in erotic books but please give me a break.  Right after that she goes to the bank wearing no more than her coat, and, when she finds old Mr Mustek has retired she gets it on with Mr. Thelwell without even blinking so much as an eye. After making the young manager see the stars in his office he then tells her NO to the loan request.  Anyway, the book is full of Venny doing people that a reader certainly gets to hate from point one. The only two people I really liked were Dani, Vennys roomate and Flora the sis in law of the replacement chef. But, the scenes with the Deni and Flora were always cut short, stilted and a downer leaving the reader in the cold.	2001-04-13

The best line &quot;Believe me mister I am your master now&quot; is certainly the most poignant words to come out of our heroine, Chloe Dubois mouth and the central theme of'Renunciation' the first of a two part book.<br />I ABSOLUTELY loved the 'Renunciation' section of  the book as our heroine plays the other two major characters like a fine stradivarious. The eroticism is so hot I kinda just wonder that both Sato, the loyal body guard, and David, the self made wealthy Japanese American, weren't popping Valium just to calm down from the predatory games of Chloe. The men in  this book are just wonderfull toys and playthings to Chloe, a virtouso player in games of the flesh. <br />Chloe's realtionship with Sato and her appearant cognicance of his deep inner feelings toward David is so masterfully written and so so so 'yummie' to read. <br />So why only three stars ..... <br />Well the second part of the book, 'Surrender' is 110 of the 273 pages is total garbage. The author  should have closed the book with just the first part since she totally ripped the rug from under the readers feet with the surrender. I mean give me a break, car accident, total memory loss AND subsequent total character change for Chloe seems almost to have been written by a different author. I felt like I was watching a full colour wide screen version of Star Wars and then was switched into a B&amp;W re-run of the Fugitve ... If Emma would have continued the  book in the classic Black Lace mode of a strong woman that takes what she wants when she wants it I would have given this book 100 stars .....  Maybe the statement of 'Believe me mister .... ' was aimed at me the reader by the author when she so drastically changed the characters in 'Surrender' ... HMMMMM  Go figure ....	2001-04-13

Books	5	8	8	N	N	Wonderfull gentle erotica with ...	gasp ... can you believe it actual undercurrents of love. WOW <br />The book is a compendium of 12 short stories with two of them Castelwood and Amer's Diary making up almost  half of the volume. As in any compendium with different authors the reader should EXPECT that they will absolutely love some of the stories and maybe be lukewarm to others. In that vein I thought that two ofe the stories more than hit the mark. <br />Castlewood is the first story of a young professional woman, Jessika,  going into the English countryside for a vacation, suggested by her friend  with the note that nearby there would be an old brooding mansion occupied by a lone non-dangerous charater that is rarely seen in the village. Needless to say Jessika's car breaks down and in a brief interlude she ends up stayng at the castle for her vacation.  The author leads us on a gentle path of submission and dominance that is so incredibly gentle and erotic that it certainly must be the fodder of a womans erotic and continuos dream. <br />The Conference, another story deals with two people, Micheal and Laura,  meeting on a red eye to New York to attend lifes' obligatory conferences. They make friends on the flight after a little chit chat and, well you know what happens when two people that attract to each other meet in a very boring situation. The gentle seduction and submission is out of this world. I felt as though I was right there on the flight enjoying every second of what Micheal was into... <br />I would probably say that this book is more geared to female readers due to the absolute gentleness and the overriding theme of submission in most of the stories, and the fact that it has that underlying current of a love theme that is so underwritten in todays erotica makes this a 5 star book for me.	2001-04-12

The hardcover book of 111 pages is chock a block full of colour illustrations (something that I am happy to see extending into many of today's newly published cookbooks) that allow the reader not only to learn how to make sushi but also see the presentation UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.  Although this book is not an encyclopedia of the sushi fare it is what the title suggests the essential sushi.  It was really great to see that chef Yoshii describes making the classic Tuna rolls using Japanses techique of putting a pich of wasabi in the roll rather than an Americanized version that contains no wasabi. I mean I can't believe some of the new yuppie sushi restaurants cropping up and dumbing down a fabulous Japanese dish!

Like all compilations of short erotic stories there are some that you will like and some that totally suck.  I really enjoyed two of the stories, &quot;Nadines Husband' and 'Never Say Never'  In the first story, Pam, the younger sister of Nadine feels quite justified in helping herself to her sisters husband, Johnny, when it was discovered that Nadine was doing her white boss. A delicious story that simply sizzles and certainly rings true to life in my bok.  The other great story deals with Diane who may not have a problem in staring a relationship with a white guy but does have a problem with men that are shorter than her. Her ad in a singles magazine brings out an unlikely white candidate for her affections. I loved this story since preconceived barriers are broken after verbal interchanges and mind games which make the erotic story that much more so.  After all the critical part of eroticism is that the characters and the readers must have a brain to enjoy the seduction ....  The book may not be everyone's cup of tea but then after all that is why it's called Brown Sugar and it's erotic black fiction...	2001-04-10

Anyway being in her 40's she has the standard obligatory lively artist married grilfriend. Meggan,  who convinces her that a week in the country at an artists retreat would do Nan good. It just so happens that Nan cant remember her mother, and after an art show finds a picture by a whacked out artist, Simone, who JUST HAPPENS to be the place where this week's retreat is held ...  Of course she goes with Meggan otherwise there wouldn't be a book.  Ok so once there her world opens up, to some extent, as she starts in INTERACT with some of the other students.  If you want to concentrate and figure out the plots and sub plots from here on this may e an ejoyable book. But, if you are like me looking for erotic interludes then mabe this book wont be for you cause I think the erotic and sex parts are belaboured at best and middle class housewifeish at worst.  I guess I could really never get into it becuse the charaters seemd so contrived. Sorry	2001-04-10

Lydia the top exec at a womans mag, Cassie the English Lit professor and Molly the socialite that arranges parties debutante balls etc etc. If the HBO series of 'Sex in the City'comes to mind you are on target except that the book isn't funny. <br />The men are cut outs from Harequin novels from Nicalas the bearded geeky bookstore owner to Harker Trevane the strong willed author. Both of them of course have those rugged good looks and hidden sophistication and where would we be without the craggy lines around their eyes to show maturity. There are also of course younger men in the book, like Zack, who I believe were written in to provide filler and gratuitous sex entertainment. HO HUM .... YAWN<br />Except for Olive, the young clerk at the book store that stops Nicolas half way down the ladder for a 'snack' that refreshes I found the book has little eroticism but a lot of vanilla bean grade sex. I also got the impression that the three girls were very uptight no matter how many times they wear leather or get tied down. <br />Sorry haven't read the captivation, but I LOVED TEA AND SPICES by Nina Roy.

The book, for the most part, is a series of letters from Adelina Mirzan to her brother Paul, both of them at different exclusive private boarding schools in the outskirts of Paris. Adelina seduces, and is seduced, by a trollish abbot who is her private tutor at home. She is a quick learner and of course drives the old man nuts. When the tutor leaves for an extended trip Adelina quickly manages to teach her younger brother to take the abbots place. Unfortunalely, Adelinas mother found the two of them together during their 'special times' and had them both sent away to boarding schools, at the recommendation of our friendly abbot, for children who are predisposed to proclivities of the flesh. It is at this school, for girls, that Adelina then describes her adventures by sending letters to her brother Paul. Girls that show their appreciation of the head mistress, and the vicar, are then enrolled into a a private society known as the 'Green Girls' and, as they progress their training they may one day strive to be part of a more exclusive group known as the 'Red Girls'. The biggest differene being that the Red Girls are members of a swap group for life and have lost their virginity .... The book is unusual because there is very little spanking as one may have expected in this setting. The girls certainly enjoy the 'fueilles de rose' type of activity and golden showers became a must .... Although this is not my kind of erotic literature I did rate it at 5 stars since it was written for people that enjoy this special kind of love, and Im sure that they are many ....	2001-03-31

From painings, etchings, drawings, snuff boxes, carvings, mouldings etc etc this book is exquisitely compiled and a pleasure to read and enjoy. If you have ever enjoyed wandering into chinatown in San Francisco to see the wide selection of erotic ivory carvings being offered then definitely you will just devour this book which also includes some fine examples of these carvings. <br />Most erotic literature published as little as ten years ago always included some of the drawings and etchings to illustrate the stories. Todays books however are devoid of these little pleasures which makes this illustrated anthology that much more important. <br />If you have any appreciation for fine art and erotica then buy this book it's a treasure to be enjoyed over the years.	2001-03-20

This fabulously written book reveals that at any age a bit of the child remains with us through the years. If it takes an exceptional author to write erotic fiction without making it contrived it takes a master like Janine Ashbless to let us venrture into her mind for a short while and enjoy a part of ourselves that gets numbed through age, life and cynicism. <br />In a series of 11 short stories the author makes us feel at home in many different scenarios and times. The authors' exceptional skill first captures our attention with a realistic and believable story, then before you know it you are identifying with the character as she draws us into the absoloute eroticism of the plot....<br />After devouring each and every story I sat back and just marvelled how she could have done that and how fantastic that my mind was able to explore a whole new area of eroticism. <br />It's hard to review short stories without giving away the whole cup of soup but when I finished just the first three stories i knew I was in for a delicious book. <br />The first story,  'Loud Sing Cuckoo' we meet Sevran a young Nordic woman the apprentice of the town witch and herbalist and feel the fear, pain and ectacy of her meeting one of the young warriors from the unfriendly North. The reader can proctically feel each drop of perspiration as events develop in this story.<br />In 'The Dragons Bride' introduces us to Sheldi the beautifull virgin daughter of one of the wealthy merchants who is sacrificed to the dragon. As a virgin bride given up by her father to be eaten by the dragon we certainly learn very quickly that Sheldi is 'street smart' enough to find a silver lining in a dark cloud. <br />The third story 'Rennaissance' describes the pilgrimage of Annette, the very young bride of a merchant to the shrine of a little known St Veronique the Virgin. The rich characters described in this book could stand as an erotic novel on its own merits. WOW <br />All I can say to Janine Ashbless, the author, is thank you thank you for letting me play in your mind even if only for a short while...

The title  of 'Daddy' has to tittilate from point one.<br />This is 'an erotic memoir' written under a pseudonym .. DUUUUHHH ... Aficionados of erotic literature, especially the Victorain classics, would not even bat an eyebrow in reading this book since incest in Victorian times was not only practiced but actually quite common. <br />The author in this book tells us a story about reuniting with his two estranged daughters, now 21 and 24 after a 20 year separation. He is portrayed as a struggling writer in LA when his daughters, still living with the authors ex in northern California, send him a letter hoping to find him to set up a meeting. <br />Both girls in their own way seduce daddy and encourage a very sexual and of course incestous relationship. The story is written in a very gentle manner and I as the reader get the distinct impression that it may have been written by a woman. Since the apppreciation of eroticism is in the mind of the beholder this book certainly will appeal to women who may have had a crush on their fathers or on their father figure.  Obviously, the three main characters know what they are doing and if there are any self recriminating thoughts of the consequences of their actions they are only described to add realism to the story. <br />The spice of eroticism must be the fusion of a good story and the reader getting to enjoy the taste of forbidden fruit. In this book the story is paramount and the sex and eroticism is definitely soft core and rates a five star recommendation in my book..... Enjoy	2001-03-13

Unfortunately like in real life on SSN's ther is little margin for errors or damage reports since you are either in top fighting condition in the sub or dead. Not too many subs are found limping into to port or like bombers after a mission making crash landings at home with thousands of bullet holes in the wings. Nope, subs are not forgiving .... there is generally only one landing when something goes wrong and usually it's like a few thou fathoms down .... <br />The action may be reptitive in the book because it deals with a hunter killer sub and thats what happens in the whole book ... it's hunter killer. <br />If you are looking for a Red october kind of book then don't buy, but if you are looking for a little boy Sunday afternoon with nothing to do kind os book, you'll enjoy it .... <br />It's like watching the Discover channel on nuke sub tactics ....

So after many many years of marriage how do you really approach that subject with your significant other ... wife/husband or whatever ... So you read erotic lit and she reads Harlequin ... Well there's a good start both are the same only one has more intensity .. The authors manage to take the unspoken a couple of steps further in opening the mind and reducing the religious importance of sex on ones life.

Even though years have passed under the bridge since Harris wrote Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs the author, as king of the macabre, has certainly lost none of his biting edge in his writing like fellow author Lawrence Sanders has (Deadly Sins Series of Thrillers)..... <br />On the contrary I think the edge now is sharper than one of Hannibal's knives ....<br />I could say this book 'goes over the top' but then I would be accused of gross understatement. If Silence was Starlings' book then Hannibal definitely IS Lechters book. <br />We see many more facets of Hannibal in this book, and, with the explanation as to events surrounding the sister Misha, is the Harris trying to eke out a feeling of sympathy and understanding for Hannibal from the reader? <br />Clarice as well has some very significant development of her character in this book as we see her embrace her dark side. <br />Can't say more here without giving it away but after you read the book you'll also be left with many many questions...  I believe that Harris tries to get us to identify with Hannibal and that is absolutely mind blowing and an unbelieveable challenge to the author and his writing skills. <br />I haven't seen the movie since I would tend to believe that many many scenes could NEVER be shown on the silver screen, and, it's easy to see why Jodie Foster didn't come back as Clarice since she would have to have a dark side in her in real life to be able to portray her character in Hannibal.	2001-02-16

After reading this book I think that the publisher of this Anonymous tome purposefully gave it the MOST misleading title imaginable ... This book written in England, proabbly around the early 1900's was also entitled 'The Secret Life of an English Boarding School', and, even that title should have been clarified to read a 'Boys' English Boarding School.<br />They say that when you take any animal, including the human animal, and place him in a one sex environment for any extended period of time homosexual behaviour will certainly start to raise it's head. This book certainly to confirm that theory in ralation to the activities at this Boarding school.<br />The book deals with Charlie Powerscourt and his three friends Bob, Jimmi the son of a Duke and Gaston a Frenck student sent to England for his 'studies'.The four boys are placed in the same dorm room of the school that appears never to have any adult supervision except for chcking homework in the classes.<br />Gaston, the more experienced and senior of the four boys recounts his experience in France with Cecile a very close friend of his mother in France. Cecile takes Gaston under her 'wing' so to say and takes him down the garden of sensual delights.<br />This is a very erotic book and I nly rated it at 3 stars since almost every one of the characters is a willing participant to the sexual activities none of which is ever described as amorous or seductive. If you want a book that is descriptive and covers all types of sexual behaviou with the exception of S&amp;M then this is the book for you.<br />If on the other and you beleieve, like I do , that a book to be erotic it must have character development and deal with the feelings and emotons of the chraters than FORGET IT....	2001-02-07

Her stiff upper lip husband, however, manages to portray a real world image in believing and practicing the old saying of 'whats good for the goose is good for the gander' does not apply!<br />The story is very contemporary and timeless and could be told over and over in applying it to many seeming happily married couples today ... To be great erotic literature it mus be believable, and, must have a storyline while not stopping at the bedroom door .... This book does that and it's MUST HAVE .... <br />It's not a Black Lace series book, but definitely it follows the genre by portraying a strong woman that does not allow herself to be subjugated by her pompous (fill in the blanks) husband ... real life ...

If I could give it 10 stars I would .... The book is a series of day books written by the characters describing their delicious experiences and interactions.... The day books are not really diaries per se, but rather an exquisite tool that allows the author to transfer the story, and perceptions, from one of the characters to another quite easily and seamlessly. The main characters are Sylvia and Phillip Mansfield,their four daughters Muriel, Jane, Amy the youngest and Deidra, and Richard the lone son. Lady Celia and Daisy Partridge and a few other characters also interact in their day book experieneces .. The book develops each of the characters, some are reluctantly sensual but learn how to enjoy the eroticism of life, while others, are more reserved and qiuetly enjoy the pleasures of the seductions .... Most of the book actually takes place in an old English countryside mansion and it sure seems like they have the money not to have to worry about working ... Phillip the father is a writer but talk about a lack of life experience for a grown man... as the reader we can enjoy the women around him certainly CURE that problem in delicious ways. In my mind, the seduction scenes in this book are classic Victorian and probably the best ever written. This is a MUST MUST have book and Im sure it's not going to be in print for long .....

It's erotic writing at it's best, hands down !<br />From the beginning even the title of this book 'out of bounds ' is so appro pos and meaningfull one can't help but thinking of the author just sitting back and chuckling as she leads us down into a garden of delights to taste that forbidden fruit....<br />The plot sizzles, character development is complete concise and totally identifiable, and the location of a hidden cottage in the remote hills of France is just plain perfect.<br />Twenty seven year old Katie, after breaking up with Robert, her unfaithfull boyfriend, and travels from England to France to take posession of her grandfathers remote farm that had been unused for some time. She arrives only to find the house occupied by two squatters, Miguel and Eric, who have been living there for some time as a very happy and frisky couple. <br />It only takes a second for Eric to hate Katie and see her as a threat to the staus quo of things while Miguel is an immediate enigma to Katie that she finds irresistible...Katie having nowhere to run or call for help is forced to stay and the plot thickens ...<br />The book slowly takes us step by step down a wonderfull path to Katie working to take Miguel at least away from the 'dark side' when a goup of wandering gypsies and Miguels' sister appear on the scene. The mood changes from electric to nuclear as Miguels sister explores a side of Katie and takes her judgemental attitude of the boys down a notch or two. When the reader thinks that this is about as hot as it can get Katie's ex shows up and she finds herself being taken to the dark side of passion .. etc .. etc ..<br />The stereotypical concepts that we have about eroticism and sexuality are are twisted turned and exposed by the author insuch a skilled fashion that we follow the story  as if the reader was there as a player in a five part play.If it's every man's voyeuristic dream to see two women getting it on then this book takes that dream and and develops a womans dream and awakening ......<br />This is probably one of the best modern erotic book ever written, and i've read a lot of them, and it's a MUST HAVE for your erotic library!

Our young diplomat, Jack, being fast in mind and body then sets up a plan to take the young girl and a friend,since no one can leave the chool without a chaperone, on an afternoon trip of delights by posing as her uncle Jack ... The story then takes us through the afternoon of unbelievable carnal delights deliciously written and described...... The girls were certainly learners ....

Generally I have found bondage books slip and crash  over the line where one finds it low on the eroticism levels and high on the cruelty level ... a total turn off for me ... <br />The book is about Richard a young contemporary English gentleman on vacation in Germany. We don't really know what Richard does, but he certainly has enough time on his hands to allow himself to be 'captured' and 'trained' by Margaret, a skilled teacher of the submissives who enjoy it .... <br />Margaret takes her time to train both males and females and then sends them to the homes of very wealthy people that love to have the pre-trained maids, hosekeepers and sexual toys under their hands .....<br />The fact that they have developed a modern use and applicaton of chastity belts in this book brings the writings and the plot to high levels ..<br />The book also manages to deal intelectually with the whole concept of the submissive surrendering to the delicious demands of their masters that makes the book seem very very real to those who are into it ...

I have read the second 1989 printing by Carroll &amp; Graf (the champions of erotic lit) in a 299 page edition that contains two volumes by Anonymous (my favorite author) .......<br />The book deals with the exploits of Captain Deveraux back in the 1800's when India was still occupied by the Brits.... <br />In the first volume the esteemed Captain is billeted in Hindustan waiting for orders. At his hotel the captain meets Lizzie the wife of one of his fellow officers. Captain Deveraux and Lizzie develop more than a relationship, hmmmmm, and Lizzie then describes how she was seduced at the age of thirteen by another soldier Captain Vincent in Britain .... <br />The second volume deals with the esteemed captain travelling to the hinterlands where he meets the Selwyn family, his commanding officer, his wife and two very young daughters Amy and Fanny .... <br />The fact that there were few eligible British men around certainly temped our esteemed Captain Deveraux and tru to the erotic nature of the book he does succumb .. actually over and over .. <br />This is an EXCEPTIONAL book in that there IS a story, there is character development to some degree and an account of a very believable lifestyle of British officers in their occupation of the Indian subcontinent. Reality is wahat makes the eroticism so so sweet requiring this book to be a MUST HAVE for your erotic library ..	2001-01-19

Quite unlike the Aztecs and totally missing from the first of Jennings books.... <br />Ok so I paid my dues in forking over the bucks for this book but Jennings the next one you publish I'll be a lot more carefull	2001-01-18

It delves into the mind of the female characters of the book making the love and sex scenes that much more erotic ..<br />Needless to say, this book and plot contains some very very strong women who are not hestiant in putting their finger, if other things, on what they really want and usually get. <br />The story is set in 1870's Australia which is interesting since one could hardly accuse Austrlians of being a matriarchal society making women such as Melanie and delie that much more interesting ...	2001-01-08

A Victorian erotic novel from our good friends of Carroll &amp; Graff is a compendium of three main books, Indescrete Memoirs, The Celebrated Mistress and Pleasure Bound Afloat .... <br />I have read and reviewed Indescrete Memoirs and it is to say the least a must have novel in it's own right. <br />The Celebrated Mistress is a non nonsense novel of a group of hedonistic debauchers that wastes very little time in character development but maintains a high level of action of the most scrumptious kind <br />The third book is supposed to be part two of the Celebrated Mistress but I am sure it was written by another author, and by the looks of it a German one at that. Iv'e never been into any of the erotic writings by any German writers so suffice it to say I probably would say that after the first  pages of this book the last 116 were an anticlimax ... Interesting to read but definitely not memorable<br />This book is one of the reasons that I have started to spend some time  reviewing because in the erotic literature genre it is quite common to have the same books published and available in numerous versions as a self standing novel or a chapter in some 5 to 6 hundered page tome. For those readers who have read some of my other reviews please let me know since it is aggravating to buy duplicates and the best of erotic literature always seems to go out of print in a flash ..... <br />Finally Pleasure Bound and Idescrete Memoirs have been published in at least 6 different versions	2001-01-01

LOL<br />In Finishing School our hero, is the assistant master in a residential French boarding school for young ladies to receive their tutoring. Seeing as to how the Vitorians loved to see diligent spankings and back door you know what this book is probably the very best enjoyed by the reader. Our hero certainly knows how to draw a fine line between the discipline and the seduction. The writer persues his story from the mans' point of view  one never really gets an impression of whether the girls were really enjoying themselves or were just resigned to allowing our hero to dominate them so that they could avoid the inevitable physical punishments that seem to have been normal and accepted at these Victorian boarding schools ...... <br />One of the better of the Blue Moon series this 1990 editon  also has a 28 page afterword written by our friend Mr. Richard Manton.

The description of their thoughts and feelings while indulging in their little pleasures is absolutely stupendous and well written.

It's well worth the wait!<br />It's the oddest thing that in Victorian times table cloths were used since it was thought that men seeing the legs of the tables would become too aroused and agressive to women. And I always thought it was because they were too preoccupied with sex to bother cleaning the tables ..<br />The story deals with Eveline, the heroine, her cousin Emma, her father and uncle. Incest was not a thing that really seemed to bother the Victorians very much, on the contrary, their literature seem to revel in it. <br />Eveline certainly is a busy little girl in this book and her trysts are mind blowing, for lack of another more apropos description ....<br />The wealthy of the times sure had a lot of what we consider 'life's little pleasures'	2000-12-30

Needless to say from a young man's point of view these are the vacations to wish for. <br />In the second book we get an INSIDE (forgive the pun) view of the Etheridge family through the eyes of Frank. Needless to say Frank manages to use his powers to overcome resistance of his sister Ethyl whom he devours to say the least.

Allan, clandestinely set up a series of encounters with differing groups of people, in differing situations where his lover could experience a complete smorgasboard of sexual yummies and delights. Most of the book just mentions our young couple as 'she' and 'he' making very easy for the reader to daydream themselves into their places and enjoy the excesses of delightfull sins of the flesh. <br />2)  'Miss Taken Book 1', is a 167 page story of another married man, Alan as well, who escapes with his practically teenage lover, Judy, and just basically dumps his wife of many years. Kim, Alans wife, tries to discover what has happened and why her husband has left her, and, she belives, the best way to do this is by sampling the fruits of illicit sex as much as she can in case she should find Alan and he may try to come back to her.<br />Kim gets to meet Walt, Alans brother and his wife Magna in an afternoon sexual romp that practically burn off the pages. This is a great erotic book and the scenes are not easily forgotten  ...<br />3) 'Miss Taken Book 2' is the third book in 'Carnal Knowledge' and is a 150 page volume. In this story we meet a young Patricia in California hoping to break into a modelling career. Patricia meets Mark on the beach and he teaches her quickly to enjoy her latent hot sexual nature. Jenny, her roomate, as well lets Patrica know, between her drug binges, that she is a bi-sexual and certainly can teach her about womanly love, the way that Jenny was taught by older girls when she was young. <br />When Patricia finally meets Larry and Ellen, a brother and sister team (in more ways than you can imagine)that take porno pics, the eroticism and sex ratchet up four notches, and, as Emril says 'BAM' we have a delicious sexual feast for the reader.. <br />This is a book that you will read and enjoy over and over and definitely a must have for your erotic library .....	2000-11-19

I have the 1970 Grove Press edition of this novel and immediately bought the April 2000 edition from Amazon. <br />The newer papebacks though come up short since the 1970 edition includes illustrations by Tomi Ungerer and they are Victorial style etchings that are HOT HOT HOT!<br />The book consist of a series of six letters written by Blanche to her friend Ethyl describing her introduction to a Victorian finishing school. Yes the girls are very very young but they are doing what they secretly, and, perhaps, on occasion, not so secretly, enjoy. Certainly this is what I would imagine most men conjure up in their minds when they think of lesbian sex ... It is so so so delicious ..... <br />You gotta get this book before it runs out of print ....	2000-10-18

Dr Eustus is able to keep her on the verge while Maya certainly is taken thru the `paces'. In other capture and discipline books this is where it usually would end but this book actually has a story and Maya is driven home since the cult leader knows that once she has tasted the forbidden fruit shell be back for more.  This is a modern story of `O' but definitely two cuts above the classic .... Eroticism at its best <br />The second book `Dangerous Affairs' is a  post WW II book in England and deals with Francia a gang  leader on the streets of  London dealing with drugs and sex,  Roger Hartnell a down and out ex air force pilot and Dora a middle class young lady that is working to try to make ends meet. <br />There are two award winning scenes that will burn INTO your mind FOREVER. The first scene of how Roger meets Dora in a bar is so real that I actually thought I was there! In a second scene Francie and Hilda, one of his cohorts, make a drug delivery to Lady Anne one of the modern society ladies in London. Francie however wants more than just the money from Lady Anne and the resulting scene is absolutely astounding.... <br />Once in her bedroom after having refused Francies suggestion  the book describes Lady Annes turmoil ... `I can't do it. I can't do it! She told herself fiercely. But the package in Francie's hands and the craving in her body changed the can't to `must'. She dug her nails into her palms and then looked up at Francie' ..... <br />This is a MUST HAVE for your erotic library .. buy it cause this on WILL go out of print!	2000-10-17

Yummie<br />Book Two is the memoirs of I would guess 15 year old George as he is both introduced and also introduces his siters and his teachers into the ways, if you know what I mean, of the world .. This is a good book but not great .... <br />The Merry Menage is also a two book story comprising of approximately 200 pages <br />Book One covers the exploits of Jack a young man in Vitorian England that is invited to the country home of a close aquaintance of Helen, her mother Maude and her younger sister Alice. Since the country home, called the nunnery, was for removed from the excitement of the city the four of them devised the most delicious games. <br />This is also a book published under seperate cover by the same name ...<br />Book Two is like a shot from left field in thei 4 book tome and whle there was little or no S&amp;M in the first 3 books this one starts with the chapter one title as 'Old Fashioned Discipline'. Fortunately this piece of poop only covers 45 pages. The intersting thing is that this book;et ever made the light of day since it endeavours and succeeds in describing spankings and then steals the anticipated sexual relief from the reader since it is mentioned but not described .. Thank goodness for my abilty to speed read... <br />All in all I guess Wet Dreams should rate 3 stars as interesting but not really a must have for our erotic book library ....	2000-10-10

The writing is Ok the sex is not really spectacular <br />Forbidden Pleasures is a disgustingly vague and and dumb story from the mexican hinterland that makes no sense and is disjointed .... <br />The editor probably hated the first two stories so much he didn't even bother to read the third story in the book .. I as well was tempted to forget it ....<br />The Musician is a third story or mini boook over 100 pages long. This is a sensless story about Mr Gus Tolman and his growing up in the US Northeast ...

Eveline is a 1987 reprint of a 1904 book of the same name published by Grove Press and now part of the Blue Moon series .... <br />I only give it 3 stars since it is a very erotic account of the life and mostly erotic experiences of a Victorian lady. The book is written in the first person and generally sticks to Evelines feelings and thoughts and the development of her character .... <br />To say that she has her mouthfull thru most of the book would be an understatement as Eveline manages to seduce pretty well all the men around her. <br />Also, the differences of this book and others that are in my library is that the sex is pretty straight by erotic standards. has little same sex escapades and almost no S&amp;M of any kind ... <br />As a first book into the realm of erotic writing I would recommend it highly ...	2000-10-09
