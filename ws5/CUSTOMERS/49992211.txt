This is the second book by Ms. Lewis that I've managed to read and I was truly impressed with the multiple storylines that she managed to introduce in this story, which is the first in a new series.  This story tackles some very important issues as well as demonstrates how a strong friendship can be very important in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />Annie Zook is the daughter of an Amish preacher and her place in her Amish community doesn't seem readily apparent to this young girl.  In order take her rightful place in the community and to marry the boy that she has always loved she must give up the one thing that means the most to her.  Her art.  But, Annie can't let this part of her soul go and as a result of this she has lost Rudy to someone else and she finds that this secret of hers is costing her more than she ever thought possible.  The only one that seems to understand her fears and anxieties is her friend Louisa.<br /><br /> Louisa is a pen pal that Annie has had for years and their friendship has grown with them.  They are each at a cross roads in their lives and they turn to the other.  What makes this hard is the fact that Louisa is from the outside.  Louisa on the other hand is getting ready to walk down the aisle but she's finding that the life she dreamed of just doesn't exist.  In a world of opulence she finds that she has nothing.  Her friend Annie seems to have the perfect life living in Paradise, Pennsylvania.  After canceling the wedding Louisa travels east to spend time with her good friend.  This is just what these two young women need.  Along the way these two must make adjustments but their friendship will see them through.<br /><br />This was an amazing read.  Louisa and Annie were truly wonderfully drawn characters that the reader will care about.  Although their storyline is the main one throughout the read, Ms. Lewis does introduce the touch subject of spousal abuse and the Amish way of dealing with this topic.  This secondary storyline is very important to the storyline between Louisa and Annie.  Ms. Lewis brings to life the Amish world.  This first book in \\"Annie's People\\" series is a wonderful introduction to this wonderful community made up of not perfect people.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designy storyline is very important to the storyline between Louisa and Annie.

Not having had the pleasure of reading the previous titles before Ms. Ewell Foster's latest effort I admit to some fear that I would be lost in the dust.  This was a senseless fear as Ms. Ewell Foster took the time to catch readers up without dropping the storyline or boring long time fans.<br /><br />The story opens with a bang as we stand along side Naomi on the set of \\"The Wheel of Fortune.\\"  The improbable happens and this lady manages to win.  Same day she finds out that she has lost her job and with no direct plans in the future except to attend the wedding of her best friend Mary, Naomi begins her journey into self evaluation.  Her journey will take her to Bodega Bay, where she will find another friend in the unlikely Ruthie, a former drug addict, abused, and abandoned rich girl. Naomi feels lost but she won't for much longer.<br /><br />Anthony who is good friends with Moor (Mary's fianc&eacute;) finds himself with a pink slip, and a request from his long-term girlfriend to hit the streets.  They are through!  Anthony packs up his few belongings and with time on his hands decides to follow up on a teenage dream.  This quest will take him to Napa Valley, a place of beauty and peace. But will he find the one thing that he's looking for?<br /><br />Along the way we are re-introduced to friends and family that some how or another connect with Mary, Moor, or Naomi.  This is truly a story that celebrates life, friendship, and love.  I truly enjoyed this read as Ms. Ewell Foster manages to cross gender, social, and ethnic barriers to deliver a heart warming read.  Thelma Latrice, Mary, are friends that everyone should be blessed with.  Add to these colorful ladies, Garvin Meemaw and the rest of this colorful cast of characters and you have a well populated but entertaining read.  This is truly an inspirational read in more ways than one.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-10-12

She creates wonderful characters and situations that draws the reader in.<br /><br />Jenova and Henry share a past.  They grew up together and Jenova was always kind to Henry even when her mother wanted her to keep her distance.  Years have passed and Jenova married another and Henry earned his place at court.  Despite these changes Jenova and Henry have remained good friends.  So when Jenova sends word that she would like Henry to come to her holdings, Henry wastes no time and goes to his friend.  He has no idea that this time things will be different.  Very different.<br /><br />Henry is handsome of face and form, trusted by the King and knights alike.  When his good friend Jenova requests that he attend her he does.  This widow has always had a small piece of his heart and he will do what he must for her.  He is shocked when he finds out that she plans to marry again. Why he should feel this way concerns him but he puts it off.  Then they take a ride and find themselves in need of shelter when a snow storm approaches.  This is just the spark that needs to be set to the kindle that is their attraction.  Now that he has tasted the sweetness of Jenova's kiss he wants more but she is promised to another.  Will he forsake all in order to make her his bride or will he step back and allow another to call her wife?<br /><br />Jenova and Henry are wonderfully constructed characters and this story is really very good.  Ms. Bennett knows how to weave a story that will captivate the reader.  It was entertaining to finally read Henry's story and Ms. Bennett did well by him.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-10-11

Although new to this author I've read a few of her earlier works and truly enjoyed her take on historical figures and the stories she created around them.  With that said I feel that Ms. Gregory's latest effort \\"The Virgin's Lover\\" although entertaining was a tad of a let down.  Perhaps due to the fact that it's a story about Queen Elizabeth and there are so many preconceived ideas about this amazing woman that creating a story for her cheats the reader.<br /><br />The story revolves around the love triangle of the young queen Elizabeth, Robert Dudley, and Dudley's wife Amy.  There was always a connection between Elizabeth and Robert that neither could admit to or act on.  Despite this their relationship grows, changes and although Elizabeth loves Robert she draws the line at allowing him to rule as King.  She'd rather he rule as Queen's Consort.  On the otherside of this coin is Robert and his wife Amy.  Amy is a Catholic and although she practices in secret a divorce from Robert is not in the cards.  Elizabeth feeling torn turns to her trusted advisor William Cecil looking for help.  Cecil has no love for Dudley and he knows that it would be bad policy if he was made King.  But he is more concerned with the fact that the Dudley family historically has participated in treasonous activities and that Roberts love for Elizabeth may not be the best thing for the young queen.  After all an ambitious man will do almost anything to see that he gets what he want's.  When love, a countries best interests, and a secret meet...nothing good can come from it.  What will Elizabeth do when faced with this situation and William Cecil's plans to put it to rest?<br /><br />Historically speaking it's difficult to put twists and turns on events that truly happened.  The creativity then come from the concept of \\"what if...\\" and I feel that this is where Ms. Gregory started her plotting.  This is a fantistical love triangle that truly existed.  Robert Dudley was the Queens favorite and this is historically understood.  Perhaps this is why this story fell flat.  No matter how hard you try...you just can't re-write history.  Ms. Gregory though does an amazing job of bringing to life, the court, the time period, and her characters Robert and Elizabeth. The reader will truly feel the angst of this love triangle.  Come to this read with an open mind and the reader should do just fine.  Forget what you were taught and just enjoy this work of fiction as it stands.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designsand this is historically understood.

I have been a long time fan of Ms. Jordan going as far back as her western historicals published by Avon.  Her latest series is just as entertaining, sensual, and romantic.  Than again I'm bias when it comes to Ms. Jordan.<br /><br />Antonia Maitland has a fire in her spirit.  She wants to do right by her loving papa but at the same time she can't help but wish that she had been born a male so she could experience all that life has to offer that gender.  All the excitement that her proper life lacks.  Well, one should be care for what one wishes as her life is going to get real exciting sooner rather than later.  Starting off with her first glimps of a naked man and later (that same day...trust me you need to read the book) a kiss that ruines her for the rest of mankind delivered by none other than handsome, yummy, sexy, sensual...well, you get the point Trey Deverill.<br /><br />Fast forward four years and our hero Trey is back in England after a rather long absence in India only to find out that his friend Sam Maitland is dead, his beloved daughter is betrothed to a nasty piece of work, and that the same daughter is now not only a beautiful lady but the hoyden has grown into a woman that Trey can't ignore...and when he's honest with himself doesnt' want to ignore.  But now he needs to keep her safe and a very real threat is out there.  Will Antonia allow her tender heart and personal safety to be kept by the dashing, yummy...Trey, or will the villian win out at the end of the day?<br /><br />Well, it goes without say that Ms. Jordan can pen a sensual read like no ones business.  But on top of that she creates characters that the reader truly wants to know and care about.  Although part of series I still feel that this read is a stand alone in it's own right.  Trey and Antonia are fun characters and although the reader my find themselves getting frustrated with Antonia at times (okay, okay I admit) she is still an endearing character that is well matched for our hero Trey.  This book will sweep the reader back to a time and place that no longer exists and right into a romance that is truly romantic.

Dynamic characters pepper the pages and I dare you not to fall a little bit in love with Alex Romero, a true dark, handsome, and protective hero.<br /><br />Jasmine \\"Jazz\\" Adams has a twin that is investigating a story that requires her (Jazz) to pretend that she is her sister Jessica. The reason behind the twin switch... so no one at the news station knows that anything is wrong. Jessica wants to be on a network, and this story might just be her ticket to the big time. Well, Jazz has no idea that her sister has been receiving threatening letters and e-mail, and she also has no idea that her new boss has hired a bodyguard to protect her. Imagine her surprise when she goes to her sister condo and is jumped right at the door by said protector!<br /><br />Things are about to get a lot scarier though when things don't start adding up regarding her sister's disappearance. Instead of phone calls, she gets text messages, it looks as if her sister comes home but leaves no notes. This is not like Jessica and Jazz starts to worry. If this is not enough, she has to deal with the sexy Alex. He is causing a whole of emotional upheaval for her but at the same time he's keeping a distance between them that she doesn't understand. Is this mess going to turn out all right?<br /><br />Alex has been told that he has to keep his principle safe and he can't touch her. Not a problem until he gets a good look at her. Than he finds out that Jess is actually Jazz and the one person he must keep safe is MIA. The search for Jess though leads to places that they can't even believe. It appears that she has participated in an adult video, but Jazz swears that her sister would never do that. The new boss seems to have deep feelings for Jess, but Jazz swears that she would never sleep to get to the top. Things are not adding up and the longer she's missing the more trouble it means. Will he be able to keep the girl safe and his heart as well?<br /><br />This was a very fast read. I literally stayed up all night to read it! There were plenty of twists and turns and Jazz and Alex were a perfect combination, which made reading their romance a pleasure. The conclusion was drawn nicely and I even managed to squeeze out a tear or ten they're at the end. (No, this doesn't give anything away...trust me) I highly recommend Ms. St. Claire and I look forward to getting a hold of her next read!<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designsto get to the top.

Ms. Raleigh's latest effort \\"Some Like It Wicked\\" was not the strongest read in the world but it did have it's moments where it entertained. The problem that I found with this read was the fact that modern day thoughts and ideas kept popping up.  This was derailing for the reader.<br /><br />Jane Middleton has gone to London for the season with the hopes of finding a husband.  This unremarkable girl knows her short comings and won't let them stand in her way. So when the perfect chance to finally be noticed presents itself, Jane is smart enough to act on it.  The fact that she has to make Hellion Caufield the Ton's biggest rake help her is little to no big deal.  She has something he needs, he has something she wants...what could be easier?<br /><br />Hellion is now in dun territory and his prospects are looking rather dim.  He has no desire to enter the marriage mart and he finds the young marriageble misses less than...inspiring.  So when plain Jane comes to him with a shocking business deal his first answer is no way...but Jane is fresh, and unafraid to admit to her faults and the jade finds himself being drawn to the very thing he doesn't want.  A romance.  But will helping Jane help him or will he find himself in more trouble than he thought possible?<br /><br />Jane and Hellion had the potential of being wonderful characters but Ms. Raleigh just didn't cash in all of the potential that was there.  Add to this the concept of a regency miss traveling to London sans chaperone, attending balls and other society functions sans chaperone, and having a head for business (okay not that big of a deal but still) and you get the picture of modern day thoughts going into this historical read.  In the end this is not a read I'd avoid as Ms. Raleigh is a fine storyteller but this effort was lackluster in attempt and execution.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Design	2005-10-10

Ms. May's deftly woven story will capture the reader's interest within the first few pages and hold that interest until the final page. This was a very strong suspense read with a dash of romance added to keep things well balanced.<br /><br />Angela David is following in her father's footsteps. She is working hard at becoming an FBI profiler that her father would be proud of. She has returned to New York City in order to work with her mentor and fathers friend Agent Cain. She is not in the city long before she gets her first case. Men are being killed in heinous ways and there seems to be no connection...it's not long before Angie puts the clues together and finds out that to her shock that this case is going to hit much closer to home than she ever thought possible. What could a serial killing she was working on have to do with her father's death? Her only tether in this new emotional storm is detective Carson Servero. He's street smart, handsome, and willing to help her through her first case. He's attracted to her but can they mix business with pleasure...or better yet, should they?<br /><br />Again readers will be drawn into this dramatic and suspenseful read. The romance between Servero and Angie is very much a \\"back burner\\" storyline but there is still enough hot chemistry between these two characters that fans of romance fiction should come away satisfied. Ms. May is a very talented author and one that should be kept in mind when looking for a plot twisting read that will keep the reader glued to the pages until the very end.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-10-10

How is this totally different woman the one that speaks to his heart?  She is totally unsuitable to be his lady...or is she?<br /><br />Lillian and Marcus were fun and entertaining characters.

Although this read does offer two very different stories, they aren't as wicked as many would think.  That's not to say that they're bland or boring...far from it just be prepared.<br /><br />\\"Winter Thaw\\" is the story of Winter, a woman that has her portrait done of her but she has no idea that the painter has already been commissioned to do a painting of her sans clothing.  This is just not done.  Imagine her surprise when she finds out the rogue that's done this is none other than Logan Cordell, the Earl of Remington.  The fact that this man gets her blood going like no one else is going to drive her crazy.  Or maybe just awaken her heart.<br /><br />\\"His Wicked Way\\" is the story of Nicholas Cain and Darcy St. James these to rakes devise a contest to see who is the best lover. In order to make the contest fair they pick Bronte Dunmore as the lady they will seduce.  This is the one woman that neither of them has ever been able to captivate.  What will happen when Bronte finds these two handsome men pursuing her?<br /><br />Both stories are entertaining but readers should be aware that although it's marketed as an \\"erotic\\" read it might be considered a tad bland.  In other words this offers steam but not as much as fan's of this genre might be looking for.  This is by no a reason to avoid the book as this is a different read and something for just about everyone.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-10-08

But, will she take a chance and love Sabastian for all time?<br /><br />This was a very quick read totaling only 86 pages.  As a result it's perfect if you want a fast, sensual, romantic read, but only have about hour to spare.  Ms. Kenyon is a truly wonderful author and I find that her books are well worth picking up despite page count.  This is a perfect introduction for readers that are new to Ms. Kenyon.

Whoever said time travel did not exist hasn't read this classic historical read!!!<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-10-04

Ms. Garvey is an author that shows very good promise with her first full length novel.  What she lacked in depth and development I'm sure she will gain with future efforts.<br /><br />Maggie Harding is a planner from the word go.  There is a reason why day planners have been created.  The concept of \\"fly by the seat of you pants\\" is beyond her realm of thinking.  Who does that???  The fact that she did something totally out of character five years earlier was not setting a precedence...no, it was a fluke thing.  So when she shows up in the Hamptons with her friend Lucy, who just so happens to be in charge of a comeback party in the form of PR for an actor that has just left rehab.  Oh, and the fact that her three day stand from five years earlier also seems to be in attendance should matter not at all...right!!!  Maggie though can't get past the fact that Tyler still brings out the wild woman in her and when she tries to put distance between herself and temptation, Tyler won't stay away from her!  Oh, but that's not the worst, the worst is when they wake up the next morning only to find Mr. Comback, Drew is found dead on the lawn, and now Maggie is trapped with the rest of \\"Hollywood\\" as well as Tyler on the grounds of Spindrift until the murder is caught.  It's going to be a long weekend.  Especially when Maggie starts acting impulsive and dayplanners are the last thing on her mind when it comes to Yummy Tyler!<br /><br />The storyline seemed a bit simple and Maggie was an unusual character.  Tyler on the other hand was quite fun and this balanced out the \\"conflict\\" between them.  This read put me in the mind of \\"Clue\\" the board game and at times I admit to doing some \\"eye rolling\\" as the plot plodded along.  Still, this was a decent debut effort and Ms. Garvey is probably an author that you will want to keep on your radar in the future.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-10-02

Ms. Joyce is an outstanding author, one that manages to capture a readers attention from the very first page.  \\"The Masquerade\\" is a read that will totally enthrall the reader with wonderful characters, and a heart breaking as well as heart warming storyline.<br /><br />Lizzie Fitzgerald has love Tyrell de Warenne for as long as she can remember.  This dashing knight once saved her life as a child and that one meeting was enough to carve a space in this gentle girl's heart.  Although part of the genteel population, Lizzie's family is not as well set as many and as a result the idea of Lizzie ever being able to marry her Tyrell is outside the realms of possibilities.  Still Lizzie will hold on to her dream of her love for as long as she can.  When she's invited to a masquerade ball at the estate of Adare she and her family attend having no idea that this will be the event that will change both Lizzie and Tyrell's life forever.<br /><br />Two years later Tyrell still can't get over the feelings that he has for the plain but sweet Lizzie Fitzgerald.  Imagine his surprise when she and her parents arrive on his doorstep with his son.  According to her parents Lizzie is the mother and he is the father.  How can that be?  Still, Tyrell does what he must but the fact that he had a fiancee and she is just the person he needs to marry in order to assure the future for Adare means nothing once he tastes Lizzie's lips.  Will he be able to set aside Lizzie and do right by his duty or will a love that can't be denied win all?<br /><br />This was an engrossing tale.  Ms. Joyce has vividly brought to life the de Warenne family and Tyrell has grown to become a remarkable man.  Tryell and Lizzie's romance is truly romantic, as well as heart-breaking but they get their happy ever after!  I can't wait for the next in this series and can only hope that it's not a long wait.  Ms. Joyce writes amazing stories that are multi-layered and almost epic in nature.  I hope that she remains true to her talent and continues this in the next \\"de Warenne\\" story.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designsns true to her talent and continues this in the next \\"de Warenne\\" story.  <br /> <br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-10-02

Ms. Mallory's debut effort demonstrates that she does have what it take to be a good author, but there are still some kinks that need to be worked out.  One thing that was a problem was the over population of characters.<br /><br />Calliope Minton is not your average Regencey miss.  She is a Caricaturist who just so happens to also play at being a ladies companion, and later a courtesan  all with the effort to get scandalous \\"on-dits\\" for her next cartoon.  Her plan, take down one member of the \\"Ton\\" at a time.  But, instead she gets more than she bargained for.  Now she has stepped into a mystery that tied to national security and her friend Stephen has gone missing and the bain of her existance the Marquess of Angelford is now forced to work with her in order to find out what happened to Stephen.  The fact that these two strong willed people set sparks to flying everytime they're in a room together escapes no one except for...Callie and James.  Will these two people manage to work together before they kill each other or will they finally admit to the attraction that they can't keep ignoring?<br /><br />This story had a lot of potential but what kept it from being \\"great\\" was the convoluted connections between so many of the characters with little ryhme or reason for the reader to follow.  It looks as if she was laying the ground work for a series and this would have been fine except again...too much with little connection.  As a result this romance between James and Callie felt forced and was not truly believeable for the reader.  One can hope that her next effort will be a tad scaled down with more attention to the \\"romance\\" and less attention to building toward a series.  Still this was a decent read and I will pick this author up again in the future.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-09-25

She always offers inventive storylines, truly dynamic and complex characters and does so without cheating the reader or the story.<br /><br />Dr. Maura Isles and Detective Jane Rizzoli are back with a vengence and their latest case is not only chilling, it's deeply engrossing.<br /><br />After a long day Dr. Isles is working on a report and when she can't remember a detail to one of the bodies she autopsied she returns to the cooler only find that there is a body that should be there yet.  She's alive...barely.  Maura has no idea though that she has uncovered a scandal of epic proportions and the fall out of this has only just began.<br /><br />Detective Jane Rizzoli is drawing near to her delivery date.  This tough, sassy, and pregnant cop is going to sit the stand one more time before she leaves on maternity leave.  What should have been an easy in and out court testimony ends up with Jane controlling the out of control suspect with the end result of her water breaking.  She is sent to the hospital where Dr. Isles \\"Jane Doe\\" was sent.  Instead of delivering her baby Jane finds herself in a hostage situation involving \\"Jane Doe\\" and a secret she wants heard.  But someone doesn't want \\"Jane Doe\\" to talk and will do all that they have to in order to seal the lips of this witness.  Before they know it Jane, Gabriel, Maura, and more law enforcement agencies than you can shake a stick at.  Will Jane and Gabe be able to save the day at the same time avoid losing sight of what's important?<br /><br />This was an incredibly fast-paced read and one that will completely engross the reader from page one.  All of our favorites come back for this story and it was interesting to see how far Gabriel and Jane have come emotionally since their first introduction.  Mila is a wonderful character that the reader will see very little of but she is what ties the various threads of this story together.  Ms. Gerritsen is a very talented author and one that I highly recommend if you like smart thrillers with all that that entails.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designsvery talented author and one that I highly recommend if you like smart thrillers with all that that entails. <br /> <br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-09-25

There is nothing I enjoy more than reading a historical novel where the reader can tell that a fair amount of research has gone into the details.  Any fan of historical novels will find this element in \\"The Noble Fugitive.\\"<br /><br />Serafina is the youngest daughter of a well respected Venetian leader.  She is aware that she must do her duty and marry, but she has already given her heart away to an artist named Luca.  After her mother catches her in a compromising situation they sequester her until they decide what to do with her.  Her father and mother than decide to start a new life in a new place...America.  Serafina goes along with this plan on the surface.  Secretly she has made plans...plans that she will see through.  But when she escapes the ship that is bound for America she realizes sooner rather than later that her dreams of love and a happy life with Luca are just that...dreams. With no other recourse she finds herself a chambermaid at Harrow Hall where she meets John Falconer.  John seems like a kindered spirit.  He has his own scars both externally and internally, and his life is in danger due to his stance on slave trading.  Together a bound forms that neither expected.  But will they be able to find a balance and will faith and love be enough when outside forces press in?<br /><br />As a fan of anything historical this read truly fed that aspect of my soul.  Serafina and John are such wonderfully created characters that the reader will truly care about what is going to happen to them and their bond is truly unique and special.  Although this is book three in a series it is still a strong stand alone read and the authors have done a fine job setting up the next in this series.  This is a entertaining read and one that I recommend.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-09-25

I admit to sitting on the fence here for Ms. Brockmann's latest effort.  I was greatly looking forward to Max and Gina's story like many of her other fans.  Sadly, this story was just not as satisfying as her previous titles.  I love how Ms. Brockmann manages to introduce new characters over the period of several titles while at the same time building the storyline.  Max and Gina's storyline to date was compelling and not unlike a dangleing carrot for readers.  Unfortunatly this read seemed rushed and not well developed.  Another sad point seemed to be the editorial comments peppered through out the read.<br /><br />Max has finally managed to push Gina away.  Although he loves her he just can't get his mind to wrap around the age difference, nor her open way of doing things.  She wants to talk, he would rather crease the sheets.  So when he finally gets his wish, that she move on and get over her hero worship of him, his heart cracks when he is told that she has been killed in a bombing.  Well, she hasn't been killed, but she has been kidnapped.  Max along with Jules (another well-known character in these books...who is gay and sadly this time around \\"type casted) try to save Gina before the terroist make good their threat. Will Max be able to save Gina and admit that she it the one for him?<br /><br />This story had so much potential but sadly the characters really never seemed to develope and at times seemed one-dimensional. A perfect example of this is Jules. His characterization at times was jarring.  For long time fans of Ms. Brockmann I suggest coming to this story with an open mind.  Everything was present here but it fell a little flat on many counts.  Ms. Brockmann is still an author I would highly recommend and look forward to reading in the future. Perhaps we will get back what we didn't get this time around with Max and Gina in her next effort.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-09-24

Ms. Karmazin truly has a wonderfully creative mind and has aptly demonstrated this for her book \\"The Huntress.\\"  Readers should be forewarned that this is beyond steamy, but done so in a very sensual way that was not off putting.<br /><br />The year is 2023 and an alien biologist is sent to earth in order to kill the \\"Chupacabras\\" which had been left behind on earth years earlier and have now become a dangerous problem.  Rulagh is sent to Puerto Rico where the problem is the largest and with little back up.  He must rely on a Sonia, a human that he can't get out of his mind.  Her scent, and zest for life calls to him.  He is hopeless to ignore what she makes him feel, and can only hope that she won't run screaming once she has seen him with her own eyes.  After he helps her escape a pack of the Chupacabras, he has no choice but to enlist her help in his fight against these vampire like creatures.  They are on a race against time but will they be successful or will they loose the one thing that they each want.  Each other?<br /><br />Normally not a huge fan of this genre I found this read to be totally captivating.  Ms. Karmazin is a very descriptive writer and has brought the future to animated life.  Rulagh and Sonia prove that love can be found if you look beyond the surface.  This was a fine read and Ms. Karmazin is one author I have no problem recommending.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Desgins	2005-09-23

For Ms. Clare's first attempt at contemporary romance she has managed to deliver a searing read.  This political romantic suspense is different from what is normally offered and as a result the reader is in for a treat.<br /><br />Kara McMillian is an investigative reporter who has just been given a lead by a whistleblower that could seriously damage reputations in the Denver area.  When threats become attempts on her life, she holds tough and keeps mum about her source.  The fact that she has a young son, is emotionally unavailale to most males, and has a new age mother on the sidelines is only half of the baggage that she's carrying around.  She now also has the steaming attraction between herself and one sexy state senator Reece Sheridan.  Never mind the fact that a reporter and a politico should never mix, when one thing leads to another there is no denying the sparks that fly the second they come together.  Will this hurt woman allow Reece a part of her heart, or will she push one of the best things to happen to her far away?<br /><br />This was an awesome read but Kara at times was less than a sympathetic character.  Reece on the other hand...this is the kind of hero's we want to read about.  He's the reason why we read romance.  Patient, kind, sexy, tough...this guy has it all.  The suspense is truly well done.  This story put in mind the movie \\"Erin Brockovich\\" but it was not a total copy of the theme.  Ms. Clare is a truly versatile talent and one that I highly enjoy and recommend.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-09-22

Her name is on the cover I'm buying the book!  This is a fun set of stories but only one is \\"new\\" as in never before being published.  The two other stories have been previously published in two other anthologies with other authors.  So a benefit is having all three B.A.D. stories in one book!!!  Downside, this was pretty much a re-read for me when I wanted fresh.<br /><br />\\"One Bad Night\\" features Jason Banks, one bad agent of B.A.D. who plays by his own rules.  Samantha has been sent to bring him in because they think he has gone rogue.  But when they are both double crossed and the truth comes out these two are both the winners.<br /><br />\\"BAD to the Bone\\" features Marianne who has won a trip to a fantasy hide-a-way where she gets to play the part of a heroine in a romance story.  But dreams become a reality when she is paired off with B.A.D. agent Kyle Foster.  This bad boy kidnapps her and brings all of her fantasy to life...which, brings all of his to life...<br /><br />\\"Captivated by You\\" is Rhea's story.  She has gone undercover as a dominatrix in order to capture a deadly terrorist.  She is sent in with a former agent named \\"Ace\\" who has set her blood to boil in many ways.  But what will happen when acting becomes reality?  Will these two finally hook up like they've always wanted to?<br /><br />Ms. Kenyon has a great imagination and she has brought that to her new series.  Fan's of the Dark Hunter novels will have to switch gears but Ms. Kenyon's trademark \\"bad boys\\" and sensuality are plenty evident. I look forward to her next effort in this series which is a full length read!  Yeah!!!

She thinks for herself, does for herself, and can't be bothered with what others think of her.  A trust issue tore her family apart and now she finds that she must go back to England to investigate a possible theft from her shipping company.  Her chance to sail for England come at the hands of handsome Pierson Drake.  From the get go these two spark energy off of each other.  It's only a matter of time before the spark kindles a flame.  Now neither of them can deny the attraction, but each has a well protected heart and is shy about laying that heart open.  Will these two wounded people find the love that they each doesn't think exist with each other?<br /><br />This was a good book.  Thea is a modern day woman in many of her thought processs' but Ms. Monroe still manages to keep to the time period despite this.  The fact that both Thea and Pierson have issues does prevent this story from reaching a natural conclusion any earlier than it already does.

Ben Tierney is caught on a mountainside when an ice and sleet storm hits.  His car is not working and he must get off the mountain if he's going to survive.  He runs into the chief of police's ex-wife Lilly.  Together they find themselves trapped on the mountain with little to no chance of making it back to town alive.  Knowing that time is of the essence they head back to Lilly's old cabin to wait out the storm.  They have no idea that what started between them the summer before is going to finally be resolved for good or ill.  But, when Lilly starts putting things together she fears that she might just be attracted to the serial killer \\"Blue.\\"  Will she live to see justice served?<br /><br />Ben has a lot to answer for and his secretive nature doesn't help things.  The local's have him pegged as a serial killer and he knows things that he probably shouldn't.  On top of that there is the burning attraction that he can no longer ignore when it comes to Lilly.  Will he be able to keep his secret and help Lilly live to see another day.<br /><br />Dutch Burton, chief of Police of Cleary and he can't get over the fact that his wife Lilly is gone, and wants nothing to do with him any longer.  His stubborn nature combined with the fact that his best friend Wes won't let things settle down only add to the burning in his gut.  He will do whatever he must to get Lilly off the mountain and away from Tierney.  He can't think beyond his jealousy and this will be a catalyst for events he can not even imagine.<br /><br />Again, this is a very good story with a so many layers that it would take too long to list them all here.

The first time I'd ever read anything by this author was her title \\"Midnight Rain.\\"  I quickly ran out and checked out this author's backlist.  I was thrilled to find out that she had a new romantic suspense being released. I quickly pre-ordered it and waited not so patiently for it to arrive.  It was well worth the wait.<br /><br />Atlanta Police Detective Jess Brubraker is good at her job but she gets no thrill from her sucess.  It's more of a means to an end really.  She became a cop in order to find her missing twin sister.  In the mean time she will do what she must in order to see that happen.  When a chance in a lifetime job gets handed to her she will do whatever she must in order to find a killer.  If she has to put her feelings about psychic's on the shelf, well, that's what she will do...maybe.  But, when this psychic just so happens to be the owner of a beautiful voice, nice hands, and a rear end that just won't quit well, it might just work.  But, what will happen when she finds out that Hank is more than a partner or psychic, but the owner of her heart?<br /><br />Hank if a former Ranger with a special talent when it comes to psychic abilities.  He doesn't do this for just anyone and when his friend approaches him, needing his help to solve a serial murder case well, he's on board.  The fact that his partner is everything that he wants to avoid is beside the point.  When he touches her he sees the truth, she is not put off by his scars and for the first time he trust that a beautiful woman wants him...and only him.  Now if only he can keep her safe from a killer that wants her dead.<br /><br />Hank and Jess were wonderful characters, and the chemistry between them was wonderfully tense!  This story although not a new one was done in such a way that the reader will truly be kept guessing until the final few pages as to who the killer really is.  Ms. Lisle really knows how to keep the suspense going while at the same time moving the story forward.

Kay Hooper books are all very entertaining and fan's of this author know to come to her Bishop/SCU reads with an open mind, and a fair bit of imagination.  These are reads where anything goes, and usually does.  So keeping that in mind, readers should truly enjoy this fast-paced read.<br /><br />Quentin Hayes works in Bishop's Special Crimes Unit but every year he has returned to \\"The Lodge\\" in order to solve the murder of a childhood friend.  Every year he comes away with nothing.  This year though, things will be much different because there is someone there that will be able to help him, but first he must convince her that she's not mentally insane, but instead a medium with unheard of power.<br /><br />Diana Bisco has spent the better part of her life medicated by doctors trying to keep her safe and sane.  But Diana is done with the med's and decides on a different course of treatment.  She takes an art class at \\"The Lodge\\" but this hotel is not what it seems and when she starts seeing dead people she rethinks her mental illness, that is until she meets Quentin.  Quentin is going to become very important to her survival if she is going to help those that wander \\"The Lodge\\" find peace.  Oh, and she must do this before a killer strikes again.<br /><br />This is truly more of a paranormal/suspense read than a romance read.  So those that are looking for an indepth romance read might want to look else where.  Otherwise the reader is in for a real treat.  Ms. Hooper has combined a great deal into this read but it's all very good.

On top of that she has to deal with the fact that her sister is there to put a stop to the fast nuptials, and her father is on the way to have a fit since there is bad blood between Julia's dad and Roman's dad (Roman is our hero). Julia has no idea that her groom to be is having business issues and when the store that her wedding dress is coming from files for bankruptcy and won't deliver her dress that's the final straw. Or at least she thought it would be the final straw. Actually when her father starts questioning Roman's love for her, and she finds out that Roman needs help but not hers she wonders if they really know each other as well as they thought they did. Will Julia and Roman have that happy ending or will life get in the way?<br /><br />What saved this story from being a dud is the ending. Yes, the ending, totally worth reading the book in order to get to it. I realize that this book is part of a series, and you obviously need to read all of the stories in order to appreciate the story. Characters are plenty in this read but if you are new to the series, it will be left up to the reader to put to together the various relationships. Julia's dad was obnoxious and overbearing and her mother was less than inspiring. Kiki, Vivien, J.B. and Alex are all alluded to at one point or another in the story, but again the relationships are vague and this was frustrating. I would have liked to have had the romance between Roman and Julia more fleshed out, less use of flashbacks to tell their story, and more context when characters were introduced. I'm sure that this is a fulfilling read if you've been reading this series from the beginning. That's what I would suggest doing before picking up this read right off the bat. Otherwise be prepared to feeling as if you have missed the boat in one-way or another. In any event the read will be less than satisfying.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designsld have liked to have had the romance between Roman and Julia more fleshed out, less use of flashbacks to tell their story, and more context when characters were introduced.

Ms. Shay has written a very complex and moving read with characters that simply jump off the pages! The conflict that she created between Bailey and Clay was so real that I felt as if I had stepped into someone elses life rather than picked up a book! Both of them were true to their belief's and as a result this was a push and pull read unlike any I've read in a while.<br /><br />Bailey is known as \\"the Street Angel\\" and her mission in life...save as many kids as she can from gang violence. If this puts her in harms way so be it. She is surrounded by her large Irish family and even though they don't totally agree with her stance...they love her enough to support her. On the other side of this fence stands Senator Clayton Wainwright. He agrees that something must be done in order to change the realities of gang life but he thinks that Bailey's take is too radical. These two strong willed people pit themselves against each other in print and even at times in person. Than one night changes everything. Clay sees Bailey in a different light and same for Bailey. But is attraction enough to base a relationship on? What about their different viewpoints that work against each other?<br /><br />Clay and Bailey are great characters! Their struggles are real and how they each handled the situation added to the telling of the story. Ms. Shay has done a very good job at portraying both sides of this very serious coin. This is the first time I've ever read Ms. Shay and I must say that I plan on looking for her backlist. This read offers it all romance, conflict, and resolution. This is a fast read and one that I highly recommend.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-09-10

Her character development is well done, and the situation that she puts these two people in is explosive. I loved the push/pull that Mac and Eve had going it made their romance all the more sensual and likeable! I look forward to the next in this series.

This is not to say that the read was not good, it was a nice read, but what kept it from being great was our heroine Julianna.<br /><br />Left at the alter Julianna Sterling is making her way in life as best as she can.  Her dreams of a happy marriage, with children running amok is over.

When his path crosses that of Julianna his life has just become that much more complicated.  It sure doesn't help that this fiesty kitten doesn't know when to back down.  Her kiss is too tempting to avoid, and they are both helpless to deny what they feel.  Is there a chance for a happy ending with these two or will secrets stay in the way?<br /><br />Dane and Julianna were interesting characters.  This story had a lot of potential but was a let down when it came to our heroine.  Childish is the best description to use when describing Julianna.  You want to feel for her but in the end...it's almost a chore.  Still, Ms. James has crafted an interesting hero, and the storyline although not new and fresh was done in a way that entertained.  Ms. James is a true talent and I look forward to her next offering.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-08-30

No one will deny that.  I surprisingly enjoyed this read although it's not one of her best, it did put in mind her earlier works, which I truly enjoyed.<br /><br />Hyacinth is the youngest of the Bridgerton clan.  She is spoiled, always says what she wants, and at the same time has a gentle caring nature.  She is also experiencing her fourth season and wonders if she will ever find love like her brothers' and sisters have.  Than she has a run in with none other than Gareth St. Clair at the Smythe-Smith musicale.  Life is never going to be the same for either of them after that!<br /><br />Gareth has just about reached his wits end when it comes to his father, his beloved grandmother is doing her best to play matchmaker, and he never seems to win when it come to Hyacinth.  But, before he realizes it, this rake is about to fall in love and it will be like nothing he ever thought it would be!!!<br /><br />Although this is not as great as some of her other reads, JQ has still managed to created wonderful characters and in my opinion an interesting storyline.  These two people had a lot to overcome and as a result their romance is slowly built and rather a shock to both characters and reader.  Ms. Quinn's trademark humor is still evident and a welcome addition to this read.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-08-19

Beverly Lewis has a very lyrical way of writing that is just spellbinding. Her descriptive prose will gently place the reader in Amish country among the various families that make Grasshopper Level home.<br /><br />Leah Ebersol's childhood sweetheart, Jonas has come back home in order to marry her. He has always loved her and he wants a life with her. First though, he must go through the \\"proving\\" before he will be considered acceptable for marriage and being able to return to the spiritual fold. But will they be able to marry at the end of this time? At the same time Jona's brother Jake has decided to return to the same area. He loves Lydiann, but a dark secret will keep these two from finding a happy ending. Will someone finally break the silence and explain why Lydiann and Jake can't have a marriage of love? And will they be able to find happiness despite this dark secret?<br /><br />Not having read the previous four titles of this series, I felt as if I was playing catch up trying to keep names, relationships, and what have you straight. Still, Ms. Lewis created a wonderful little world that I cared enough about to try and figure what on earth was going on. This did require some back tracking I admit. Ms. Lewis has carefully and with a great deal of creativity, created a wonderful setting with enough detail to put the reader in the middle of Amish country. Again this was a good read but not a strong stand alone read. I recommend picking up the previous titles before picking up this one. I'm sure that this read will be more satifying to be sure if you did.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-08-16

It's now time to make Ashley realize that he is not just her brother's best friend, but the one man for her?

He has accidently shot himself with the \\"love\\" arrow that was meant for Valentine's true love.  This might just be the answer to a wish rather than a true curse.<br /><br />\\"Mesmerized\\" is the story of Amdana Dillion.  She has more men falling in love at her feet that she can stand.  Of course they are hypnotized at the time.  The truth of the matter is Amanda would love for Derek to fall mesmerized at her feet but because of love not hypnotism.  Will these two find love or will it just be a test of wills?<br /><br />All three stories were entertaining.  They are fun, light reads that are steamy and sensual.  Brava has the ablitiy of turning out short stories that don't cheat the reader with content...or lack thereof.  This is one read that I recommend that you add to your reading list.

Ms. Adair has created a great action/adventure series that teams fast paced stories with yummy alpha male heros.  This story is no exception.<br /><br />Taylor Kincaid is a jewel thief.  The best there is when it comes to taking hard to get pieces.  What she doesn't know is that she has been followed and the man that has her in his sights will not give up until he has exactly what he wants.  Her B & E ablities.  Taylor though is not going to go with out a fight.  She doesn't care that Huntingdon St. John makes her knees weak with just one kiss.

He will do whatever he has to in order to put an end to the terrorist group he is tracking.  His heart will just have to be put on hold.  Or will it?<br /><br />Taylor and Hunt are great characters.  This story is a little bit of \\"Alias, add a dash of \\"The Goonies.\\"  This is really a very good story but the romance between Hunt and Taylor was more of a secondary storyline.  I truly had a hard time believing that these two fell so far in love with each other at the end of the story.  This is not to say I didn't feel their attraction...that was evident but anything more than that was a bit of stretch.  Still, this was a real good read with plenty of action to keep the reader fully engaged.  Ms. Adair is a very talented author and one that will transport you right into the pages along with her characters.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-08-15

Especially when she finds out that her hunky Ian is a hybrid vampire.  Will she follow her heart, or will she let her pride get in the way of happiness?<br /><br />This was a fast read in which we are introduced to some great new characters, and at the same time we visit again with Rana and Lucian.  Readers may get a tad frustrated with Jax as she is stubborn and a tad overbearing at times.  Still, she is a good mate for Ian who is just as yummy as yummy can be.  Ms. Michelle writes really fun vampire romances and is an author that I recommend when it comes to this genre.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-08-13

I have read all three of these books...out of order of course, but that has no bearing here.  Suffice it to say that each of the stories are strong stand-alone reads.  This one though touched me deeply.  The many \\"taboo\\" subjects such as child molestation, bi-racial relationships, and slavery are important to the storyline and character development.<br /><br />Grace's life has not been easy.  A victim of child molestation she has grown up on her father's sugar plantation with a very strong stance on the issue of slavery (she is a result of a bi-racial relationship) and wants to have nothing to do with marriage much to her father's dismay.  When Giles Courtney shows up one day to transport sugar but not the slaves Grace's father would like transported, they find that they share a common belief.  But, will this be enough to bring them together?<br /><br />Giles is cautiously smitten with the pretty Grace.  When he finally asks for her hand in marriage it's with the belief that they could find the happiness that his former Captain found with his wife.  Giles wants a wife and children.  He wants to settle down.  But will Grace allow Giles to defeat the demons that haunt her and allow her to dream of a happy loving ending?<br /><br />I dare the reader not to fall a little in love with Giles themselves.  He is a true hero especially when it comes to the damaged heart and soul of Grace.  Ms. Reed was true to character development and Grace's standoffish manner was understandable and added actually to the romance between Giles and Grace.  Readers should be patient with the developing relationship between these two characters.  Obviously they just don't jump right in with both feet and find true love.  Instead this is a relationship that is slowly built over time and in my opinion much \\"richer\\" as a result.  Ms. Reed is a stellar example of what the genre has to offer as far as writers go.  She is not afraid to tackle touchy subject matter, and her descriptive writing will transport her reader to time and place with little effort.  Kudos' Ms. Reed for thinking outside the box.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designsransport her reader to time and place with little effort.

Ms. Henley always offers her readers strong almost willful heroines, and strong male leads that manage to support rather than stifle their spirit.  This story is no different.  What is different is the fact that hero and heroine spend a good deal of the story apart from each other.  As a result this is not the normal type of read that we normally get from Ms. Henley.<br /><br />Christopher (Kit) and Nicholas are twins that are as close as they can be.  They often switch places and Kit being the favored older son is willful and weak.  Nicholas on the other had is despised by his father and when he is accidentally killed in a hunting accident by Kit, Nicholas steps in and takes the blame.  It only gets worse though.  The one thing that Nicholas was counting on is the family horse farm.  When the will is read, he finds out that he has been cut out totally.  Nicholas has pride and will not sit back and let society mock him.  He joins the army and heads to the Peninsula in order to fight Napoleon.  He leaves behind the one thing that he wishes was his.  Alexandra Sheffield.  She is met for his brother and he wishes that she were his.  But, fate has seen the end to that dream.<br /><br />Alexandra has always loved Nicholas.  She grew up with Kit and Nicholas and although her grandmother wants her to marry well, she wants the younger son.  Problem with that...is Nicholas has honor and he won't dishonor Alexandera.  She also wants to be a writer but that dream is also going to be hard to achieve in a world that is dominated by men.  She is deeply hurt when Nicholas leaves without saying goodbye in order to fight a war.  While he is away she leads a very dangerous, and unorthodox life.  One that opens up doors to Alexandra she never knew existed.  What will happen when her hero returns from the war?  Will she finally find love with her Nicholas, or will she be forced to marry the other twin?<br /><br />Alexandra was a very unusual heroine.  Her ideas and actions are not what you normally find within the pages of Regency romances.  At times her actions were a bit overbearing.  Kit and Nicholas are dynamic characters but they didn't really seem to develop as Ms. Henley's other hero's.  I would have liked to see Alexandra and Nicholas' relationship more fleshed out and I would have like to have seen them together more.  Especially without the misconception regarding which twin was which.  Call me romantic but I would think that Alexandra should have been able to the difference between the twin she loved and the twin that was a friend.  Especially after having grown up with them.  Still this was an entertaining read although not one of my favorites by this talented author.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designst what you normally find within the pages of Regency romances.

The reader was introduced to this hero in Ms. Reeds' \\"Into His Arms.\\"<br /><br />Diego is a Capitain of his own ship, and he hopes the Captain of his destiny.  To his crew he has the devils own luck when it comes to winning sea battles, or avoiding conflict.  Diego doesn't tell anyone that he is visited by a saint...Mary Magdalene herself.  Mary has promised Diego his soul mate but first he must get through several different test.  When he comes upon a ship that his crew would rather out sail they gain more than monetary satisfaction...they save Mary Kate O'Reilly.  Is this a reward or is this going to be a test of his faith?<br /><br />Mary Kate O'Reilly is a strong Irish lass and she will do what she has to in order to return to her beloved home in Ireland.  She has gone with her maternal grandfather to England in order to be married off to the highest bidder.  They have an agreement between them, and Mary Kate thinks she has bested her less than loving grandfather.  Truth though is he has gotten the better of her.  He puts her on a ship bound for Jamaica and her waiting fiance.  En route her ship is captured by pirates and she is taken for ransom.  Things are only goint to get worse she thinks when this ship is set upon.  The difference is...she is taken in by a Spanish Captain...none other than Diego Montoya Fernandez de Madrid y Delgado Cortes.  This strong and handsome man has learned his lesson when it comes to English ladies.  He will not fall victim to their allure again.  Mary Kate wants to go home but Diego has other plans.  Despite their differences these two strong characters can't help be drawn to each other.  Will they allow themselves to find happiness or will pride and othe interests stand in the way?<br /><br />Mary Kate is a hard character to like in the beginning.  Her strong willed nature did get tiresome after awhile.  On the other hand Diego was a very different hero, unlike many that we come across in this genre.  The end result are two very different characters but one entertaining read.  With a little help from some very special ladies these two find that love and happiness can be their ending.  Ms. Reed is a very talented author and one that I highly enjoy reading.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designsero, unlike many that we come across in this genre.

Ms. Burton will take the reader on a trip to the worlds of the fairies and elves with this two story read.<br /><br />This book contains two stories about two sisters that are princess' to the fairy world.  One must marry the King of the elves and the other finds forbidden love with his captain of the guard. It's forbidden because she is promised to another and honor will not allow them to consumate their passion.  Or will circumstances change and true love and passion be theirs?<br /><br />Both stories are short but well-fleshed out.  In other words there is more substance than sex scenes.  This is not to say that this read is not steamy...it is but, it's not used as filler. The characters are dynamic and Ms. Burton has aptly demonstrated with this read that she has quite the imagination.  Step into her mystic world for a short while.  You won't be sorry.	2005-07-20

He always does what's right even if it means taking the long route to a solution.  When he meets child advocate Macy Capshaw his beliefs will be challenged at every turn but working with her is essential to solving the case that he is working on.  What he doesn't expect is the strong tender emotions that the sassy, scrapy, make-my-own rules Macy inspires in him.  Will he be able to follow his heart at the same time maintain his belief in always doing the right thing?<br /><br />Macy Capshaw is a lawyer and the majority of her work is dealing with abandoned children and abused women.  She has a secret that she has been carrying for the past twelve years and when Detective Santini comes a knocking his case stirs up more questions regarding Heavens Gate medical facility than she is comfortable with. Is it possible that it is part of a black-market adoption scam? And is it even more possible that her lawyer father is part of it?  These questions lead to Macy taking control of the investigation putting herself in danger, and making the differences between the handsome detective and herself all the more glaring.  Can they find a happy ending and put an end to the nightmare that they have stumbled into?<br /><br />Ms. Style has a flair for suspense.  There were several times where I held my breath waiting to be caught!  It takes great talent to pull a reader so completely into a read that they feel a part of it!  This is a push/pull relationship and two more opposite people could never be matched...but still their romance is believable...perhaps because of the different things that they have to tackle before a happy ending is found.

Ms. Lindsey was one of the first author's I picked up when I started reading historical romance.  I loved her!!!  I purchased her books the second they were released, not caring if they were hardback or paperback.  Sadly, I now borrow her reads from the library rather than lay down hard cold cash.  This read though was not as bad as I feared it would be.  This is not to say that this read was problem free...sadly it was far from that but, it was better than many of her past efforts.<br /><br />Sebastain Townsend is banished from the family seat and even England after a duel ends in the death of his best friend Giles.  Knowing that he is to blame for the whole situation he leaves England with just a friend and a few items and makes a name for himself as \\"The Raven\\" on the continent.  This mercenary for hire will do whatever he must to see the job done.  Does he have a death wish?  Maybe.  Than a face from his past comes looking for him, appealing to what she mistakes as his honor and pride.  Come back to England with her and figure out who wants his father dead.  Sebastian agrees after Maggie is willing to pay an outragous fee.  In order to get back onto the estate they pose as a married couple.  This shame relationship though is hard to put aside after awhile as they both start feeling very intense emotion for the other.  Will they allow themselves to have a happy ending or will the enemy hiding in the shadows see to a rather different ending?<br /><br />Again this story was mildly entertaining.  I at turns liked and disliked both main characters Sebastian and Maggie.  Both were so concerned about putting up a \\"fake\\" front to the other that it did begin to wear thin.  The \\"suspense\\" line of this story seemed a bit forced...but still was a good foundation as any.  Overall this read had some entertaining moments, and it was a bit of surprise to see how this story ended.  Still, I long for the old days of Ms. Lindsey's sensual, romantic reads and wish that she would consider returning to those roots.  She had a formula if you will that worked and enticed the reader back again and again.  I can only hope that she takes a look at how she fleshed out likeable but strong characters in her older reads and attempts to do the same on her next effort.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designsd consider returning to those roots.

Her destiny is none other than Comte Renard.<br /><br />Ariane has become the Lady of the Isle after the death of her mother.  Life is hard for her and her sisters since their father has left and bills are mounting.  She has been keeping to herself on Faire Isle when trouble comes in the form of the Dark Queen.  Catherine De Medici has aspirations that she will see come to light.  If this means setting an evil witch hunter after those that live on the Isle of her late friend (Ariane's mother) than so be it.  Ariane will do what she must in order to keep her people safe.  What she doesn't want to do is be forced to marry Renard.  She wants love deep in her heart, despite the pain that she has seen due to \\"love.\\"  Still she is drawn helpless to the Renard.  Will she allow her heart into his keeping though, or will pride stand in the way?<br /><br />Renard is from humble stock.  His grandfather despised him and the feeling were returned.  Still, he must marry and when he sets eyes on the calm beauty of Ariane he will do whatever it takes to see this lady his bride.  Neither is looking for love, but love will find them anyhow.  Will they be able to save their love as well as the people who are counting on them?  Or will the Dark Queen win all?<br /><br />Ms. Carroll has taken the aspects of magic, witchcraft, romance, and history and combined them all into a absorbing read that will enthrall the reader.  This is the first time I've ever read anything by this author and I have to wonder \\"what have I been doing???\\"  I love historical reads that actually have history in them.

There is a natural chemistry between them that the readers will see and feel.  Their push, pull relationship is caused by past experiences so it's fun to see these two strong people find love.

As an aspiring author I appreciate several thing when it comes to penning a read that fans will want.  For already established authors their needs are different.  The need to grow with the industry while still maintaining a fan base, while feeding the creative soul are all things that I'm sure run through a writer head.<br /><br />Well, this story may feed Ms. Howards creative soul but falls short in the rest of those areas.  This is really more of a Sci-Fi read with romantic overtones, and a very weak suspense storyline.  This would all be okay IF the main characters spoke to this reader even a little bit.  Knox and Nikita bored me.  Yes, bored me.  There was no spark of attraction that I could understand let alone relate too. The suspense storyline was laughable and a stretch to say the least.  For fans that loved \\"Dream Man\\" don't look for the same type of read here.  You will be left disappointed.<br /><br />Knox is a police detective in his small town.  Not much happens there so when acts of vandalism accompanied by strange light flashes start taking place, along with the arrival of the mysterious Nikita Knox inquistive nature takes over.  Questions lead to more questions and than he is faced with the most outragous idea ever.  Nikita is from another time and although they set sparks off of each other there is no way they can have a future.  Besides, there is the mystery surrounding the missing time capsule and the murders that are taking place.  Who is the killer and what is he/she after?<br /><br />This story had potential but fell flat in a lot of different areas as mentioned before.  Fan's of Sci-fi may actually find this read mildly entertaining but for long time fans of Linda Howard...well, just don't expect much.  Normally her hero's make me melt...Knox was...obnoxious.  Nikita...I truly felt nothing for the heroine.  If the main characters can't get a reader...what's the point.  I'm no longer going to jump on a Linda Howard read.  Her last attempts have been poor offerings.  This makes me sad since I've read just about everything she has penned going back to her series romance offerings.  Is it possible that she is running out of stories to tell?

She finds more in New Orleans than a mising sibling, she finds her heart and sensuality as well.<br /><br />Stephanie has come from Chicago looking for her sister Tina who has turned to a lifestyle that shocks Stephanie.  Armed with faith, a few pictures, and a lot of guts, Stephanie goes to Chez Sophia looking for her sister.  Instead she finds ex-cop turned bartender Jake Broussard.  Their first meeting is hot and stays with them both long after she has left the sensual location.  She has no idea though that trouble is on it's way in the form of yummy, sexy cajun Jake.<br /><br />Jake has walked away from his old life with no plans on taking up where he left off...caring way to much.  Than in walks Stephanie.  He can tell right off that this lady is in the wrong place and there will never be a right time either.  Despite his best intentions he agrees to help her find her sister...provided she stays out of the way.  It would probably be easier not to have a hurricane blow than to keep Stephanie out of trouble.  Despite her lack of listening...Jake is drawn to her and when everything is said and done will he allow his heart into her keeping?<br /><br />This was a great read.  Steamy, sensual, with just the right amount of suspense to keep the reader engaged.  Ms. Blake has established that she has what it takes to create stories that a reader will want to pick up.

I would have like to have seen their past a little more fleshed-out as this added great depth to who they were and why they acted the way they did.  That said Ms. Byrd was still able to convey the raging sensuality between these two people and the romance that grew between them.  This read is not for the faint at heart so be forewarned there.  Still, Ms. Byrd wrote a sensual romance where the love scenes conveyed the deep feelings neither characters were willing to admit to at first.

Ms. Fields has done a good job on re-telling her tale of the Greek myth Persephone.  Basing a romance on a myth doesn't change the story but Ms. Field has brough human qualities to both Hades and Persephone thus making them seem more real to the reader.<br /><br />Persephone, daughter of Demeter is the most beautiful girl in the villiage.  Upon attending a funeral, Hades spies the her and wants her for his own.  Some days later while picking flowers with her friend Persephone is taken down to Hades realm where he attempts to woe the lady who will have nothing that he has to offer.  During a course of time Persephone begins to \\"know\\" Hades and the things that he knows and realizes that he not much different than she is.  But could she give her heart to the man that she has learned to know?<br /><br />Again, this is not a new story.  What is new is Ms. Fields entertaining prose, and the way she has developed unique qualities in these two famous characters.  Overall this is not a strong romance so much as it's a different take on an already established myth.  Don't pick this read up expecting something new as Ms. Field has stayed true to her inspiration.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-07-07

She is done with men after she get rid of her sleazy ex.  Well, at least she thought she was done with men.  Her mind is changed though when she makes a move in order to get a fresh start in New Bern, North Carolina. One sexy detective named Gray Evans is making her rethink her stance on men.  Will he be around though at the end of her trials and tribulations?  See, trouble has followed Sophie to her new home.

With help from her family, her dad's friends, and yummy Gray things will be put to rights...right?<br /><br />Sophie is a heroine for today's lady!!!  She can take on the bullies by herself (and innocent plumbers as well but you have to read the book), but still have the good sense to know a good thing when she sees it.  In this case our hero Gray.  Gray on the other hand is sexy, strong, but not in an over powering way! In other words a perfect couple.  Ms. Bartholomew has added a new twist to the romantic suspense genre.  This story is penned in 1st person POV, with laugh out loud moments, quirky secondary characters, and slowly built sensuality that is toe curling.  In other words, this is a book you won't want to overlook!<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-07-06

They call it fiction for a reason. If you can do that than you are in for a fun romantic romp in an unlikely location.<br /><br />Cole Ryder is a former U.S. Marine turned screenplay writer who has written an action adventure screenplay set in the wilds of a rain forest.  In order to make this seem more legit for film goers he hire's a survival specialist to help make his movie more realistic. (Remember...fiction) Well, his problem is not going to be learning about the tropics but instead keeping a lid on his emerging feelings for the sexy but shy Ariel Leigh.<br /><br />Ariel has a bruised heart and a problem with self confidence.  Not your normal problem for a person that can take on a rain forest and come out smelling like a daisy...okay some tropical flower just the same.  But Cole speaks to her heart.  He is everything that she wants, but everything she can't have.  Or at least she thinks so.  But will several days in the rainforest change things for the better for Ariel or will she let her hero walk away from her?<br /><br />If you can get past the concept that a former U.S. Marine Force Recon officer will need help to survive in a rainforest, let alone need help to \\"spif\\" up his screenplay you will probably enjoy Ms. Donahue's latest effort.  Aside from the unrealistic situation this was a fast read with great interaction between Ariel and Cole.  Their dynamic is different but fun.  This is a sweet but steamy romance between these two people.  There are really no factor's provided as conflict except the issues that Ariel has.  I would have like to seen this expanded just a bit to give it more punch but overall it plays okay.  This is a good book to take on the road or to the beach.  Although not above average this is still a fun read with some laugh out loud moments.  Not brain surgery but entertaining if taken at face value.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-07-05

She has taken on religous issues, placed it in a very different setting (we are back to ship board romances...I like this idea very much as I've missed them) and added some very compelling characters to the mix.  Then end result is a fun, fast-paced read that will keep the reader firmly engaged.<br /><br />Faith Cooper is being forced to marry a man that she doesn't want.  Going against her families wishes, teachings of her religion, she stows away on a ship bound for Jamaica and an aunt she didn't know she had.  This decision will change her life in ways she never thought possible.  Captain Geoffrey Hampton is going to steal into her heart but will she be able to keep his?<br /><br />Geoff and Faith were wonderful characters!  Their romance is truly wonderful and the reason many pick up the genre.  This story delves into many touchy issues regarding religion.  This book will touch the reader in many ways.

Once put to shore on a remote island what will come of them all?<br /><br />Anthony is surprised by how wrong he had Savina figured out.

He finds his employers fiancee more than attractive.  She has woken his desire and the feelings that they each feel for the other can't leave the island...or can they?<br /><br />Ms. Simpson has penned a period romance that doesn't really fit the period.  She has taken a regency miss and given her some backbone.  A nice change from the norm.  This was a fast read and one that offers a different setting, different circumstances, and as a result a different read for the fans of Regency Romance.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-07-02

The Knight family saga is one of my favorite historical romance series of all time!  Ms. Foley has created a very entertaining group of characters and each and every read has delivered a romance to remember.<br /><br />This time around we are treated to Lord Alec Knight's story.  Alec is the rake of all rakes!  He has not met a bet, lady, or challenge that he hasn't walked away from.  Still Alec has lost and lost big.  His luck has run out, his family has reached their limit, and the one person he always thought would be there for him has married another.  Just when he has reached his lowest point yet his life changes.  The catalyst of this change is none other than Miss Becky Ward.  She is fiesty, sassy, loving, and in big trouble.  He has finally been given a reason to turn his life around.  Will he be able to do that and get his lady or will fortune turn her back on this handsome rake?<br /><br />Becky and Alec are wonderful characters!  I truly was engrossed with this read from start to finish.  Ms. Foley tackles the important issue of gambling addiction and does so gracefully.  Alec is not a perfect hero, which is why he is.  This sensual story will capture readers from the very beginning.  Alec is one hero that will stay with readers long after the book is over and his lady love Becky, is also very worthy of her knight.  I highly recommend Ms. Foley she is an author that is an automatic buy for me and she creates characters that will stay with the reader ong after the story is over.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-07-01

Her story \\"Something Wicked\\" is a witty combination of chick-lit, paranormal, and erotica. As a result this read will stand out for many since these types of read are few and far between.<br /><br />Desy is a P.I. who lives with her aunt in Michigan. She works and is partners (working relationship only) with her best friend Nick. Things are not always what they seem and well, sometimes they are exactly what they seem.<br /><br />Desy thinks life is going to be as predictable as it can be until she comes home one night to a mysterious visitor that her aunt welcomes with open arms. Armand is tall, dark, sexy, and Parisian. Oh, and there is the small matter that he thinks that Desy is a witch as he is, and that she is going to help him since she belongs to him. Right...all the time. Now, nutty things are happening and the attraction between Desy and Armand can't be ignored. Will Desy accept that she is tied to Armand or will darker forces keep them apart?<br /><br />This was a quirky read. This read was both entertaining and annoying. This is written in 1st person POV and if this is a format that doesn't appeal, keep that in mind. Otherwise Desy and Armand are rather entertaining characters that will entertain while the reader hold the book. This is a spicy read and there is really no closure at the end of the read. Will she stay or won't she kind of thing. This story does continue into the next title \\"Something Wanton.\\"<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-06-26

Her latest effort is no exception and this read is just another example of what wonderful alpha male hero's she manages to create as well as the complex storyline.<br /><br />Mick Savin is in New Mexico working to gather intel to be used later against Spectra IT.  He is caught and than beaten and left for dead.  Thankfully, Mick is rescued by one sassy lady that despite her better judgement helps him.<br /><br />Neva Case has her own secrets to keep, so she is less than thrilled at first to find herself reacting to the sexy man that she rescues.  He wakes all sorts of feeling that in Neva's opinion would be better left buried.  Still she can't help but be drawn to Mick and even though she knows he has secrets of his own...allows him to draw close to her.  She has no idea that this is the best thing she could ever do.  In fact she might be able to finally find the peace she has been searching for.<br /><br />Along with the main conflict between Mick and Neva, Ms. Kent has created a very absorbing secondary storyline, as well as secondary characters that jump off the page for the reader.  Ms. Kent's trademark senuality, as well as her fast-paced read are all present in this latest adddition to the SG-5 series.

Now what's a good southern girl suppose to do when strong men tend to make her weak and not in a good way? Chalk it up to research!<br /><br />Chase Casey is a police detective and he has been set up by his best friends wife on a blind date. Chase has few rules in life, but he does have some and he won't overlook them. One rule is he won't get seriously involved with a woman, and he won't change his career plans for his wealthy mother. Enter Miranda. She is one sassy, sarcastic lady but he still can't forget her or his reaction to their first meeting. (I won't give the details away...you'll need to read the book) Needless to say this protective guy is way over his head but he can't help but be drawn to the prickly lady. Will he be able to walk away from her when she returns home or will she take a piece of his heart away?<br /><br />Miranda is a complex character and readers may be turned off by her less than heroine like attitude and reactions. I suggest though that the reader stay with it as she truly grows and changes along with her growing relationship with Chase. This read offers laugh out loud moments, and well as teary ones and is truly a fun read.

Yes, they than realize why they loved to begin with and voila...one happy ending for everyone.  What makes this story different is the characters.  Plain and simple they are fun and they manage to pull the reader into the story if it's only to find out just how they will end up with their happy ending.<br /><br />Nick and Dana have a past and they are both trying very hard to move on from their not so happy ending.  Problem with this is that neither of them can for different reasons.  Than on the anniversary of what would have been their wedding if things had not gone straight into the garbage...Dana has a break through.  Nick Maybe on the other hand wants to just put distance between him and the one woman that he ever loved, Dana.  The fact that one person (and no it's not Dana) will not let him do that doesn't make things any easier for him but, he will give it the ol college try.  That is until he is asked to do just one more favor for said interferer.  The fact that this favor includes swiping a bird from its owner should be just chalked up to another day in the life of Nick.  Instead it brings Dana right back into his life.  Will theses two hurt but special people a chance to fix what went wrong or will things go from bad to worse?<br /><br />Nick and Dana were fun characters and their story although not earthshaking was a very pleasant read.  Again, this read is nice but it does at times stutter and slow.  Thankfully these times are few and far between.

She always manages to create a very fun world in which the reader can escape for a short while. I have enjoyed this series and looked forward to Marcus' story.  Well, this story was a nice ending but lacked the excitement and sentiment that the previous titles offered.<br /><br />Marcus is in search of the family ring that has fallen into someone else's hands.  His search leads him to none other than Honoria Baker-Sneed.  This minx has been his bane in many situations and now...he must deal with her in order to obtain his family ring.  The fact that the ring holds a special meaning and the belief that is will leader the owner to his destiny.  Marcus is not fanciful but it's not long before the strong but sensible Honoria scales the walls that hide his heart.<br /><br />Honoria feels a special connection to the ring that Marcus is after.  She at first plans on selling it in order to secure monies for her siblings.  But, plans change when the arrogant Marquis of Treymount arrives at her doorstep demanding his ring back.  What happens when pushed into a corner...Honoria pushes back and right into a relationship she never counted on.  But will circumstances seperate these two people and cause a strong love to falter?<br /><br />Honoria was less than a perfect heroine with her sometime overwhelming need for making Marcus \\"Pay\\" for the ring that by rights already belongs to him.  This derailed the tale at times and by doing so pulled this reader away from the romance.  Otherwise this was a fine read.  Secondary characters such as Honoria's siblings were fun and welcome additions to the story.  Of course Chase, Devon, Brandon, and Anthony make small appereances.  This was a fine ending to a series that I've highly enjoyed.  I look forward to Ms. Hawkins next read.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-06-11

This was an emotional read regarding the coming to terms with reality rather than perception from a young woman's point of view regarding her own mother.<br /><br />Ellie is the youngest daughter of three and she has a hard time coming to terms with her family and the way they see her.  Her mother is now fighting cancer and wants to take a tour of Europe to re-visit the places she had once seen.  The Dwelling Place calls her.  Ellie can't think of anyone she'd rather not tour Europe with but since her other sisters are busy with their lives Ellie reluctantly goes.  This will be a trip that teaches her more than she ever thought possible.  Will she loose her mother though just when she is finally getting to know who she really is?<br /><br />This was a very emotional read and for the most part well written.  There were several places where the story dragged and there were times when the read became a little preachy in context.  Still these were few and far between and as a result not too much to ruin a very good story.  \\"The Dwelling Place\\" is a good read that just about anyone can relate to.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-06-09

One of my favorite historical romance authors has taken a detour and for her latest effort has penned a rather quirky chick-lit/contemporary romance that was highly entertaining and fun to read.<br /><br />Brenda is a woman that has not had the best track record with men, take her latest...Larry.  \\"Mr. Perfect\\" has it all except for a personality that's not obnoxious oh...and we can't forget that he just dumped Brenda on New Years Eve.  Well, she's not going to let that stop her.  No way our Brenda is made of much sterner stuff and in a moment of insight decides to head into a very expensive lingerie store in order to console herself.  This starts her off on a lingerie addiction that she is only too happy to accomodate.  Now if she could just get over the man that she woke up with earlier in the day. Of course  Yes, I did say man but you must read the book in order to find out just how mystery man fits in!<br /><br />Never fear Brenda along with a wonderful secondary cast tell a rather funny tale of finding love where you least expect to find it, with the last person you thought possible.  This was a fun chick-lit read and although written in first person not obnoxious in anyway.  This is one read that I highly recommend, and I hope that Ms. Ashley continues penning heartwarming contemporaries.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-06-08

Ms. Melton has delivered yet again another fast paced read with one incredible hero, and one fiesty heroine.  The end result...a read that will absorb the reader until the final page.<br /><br />We met Lt.

Luther is a SEAL and he and \\"Westy\\" have been selected to go and rescue Hannah Geary from the prison in which she's been put by \\"the individual.\\"  Luther thinks it will be an easy extraction...and to a certian degree he's right.  What he's not counting on are his feeling  for the sassy Hannah.  He has been burned recently by love and he is not interested in any way shape or form for a woman who's not interested in the same things he is.  Home, family, and children.  Hannah wants her career in the CIA and he won't stand in the way of that.  But will he be able to let her walk away from him?<br /><br />Hannah Geary is a tough and sassy lady.  She has dreams of finally working overseas as her father had playing a role in keeping America safe.  She is rescued by Luther and Westy and she feels instantly safe with Luther.  He makes her feel things she'd rather not feel and question whether or not she can live without her very own SEAL.  Together they work to save Gabe (Forget Me Not) while trying to stay one step ahead of a killer.  Will Hannah be able to balance everything she's dealing with without loosing the one thing she never realized she wanted?<br /><br />Hannah and Luther were wonderful characters.

Bryna and Tynan were wonderful characters that truly reached out and pulled the reader into their story.  This was a romantic but at the same time sensual read that held my interest until the final page.  Without a doubt this is a \\"top drawer\\" read.<br /><br />Bryna was orphaned and left along the shores of an ancient loch but was found by a healer named Derina.  Derina never tells Bryna of her true ancestry and Bryna grows up feeling alone and lost.  She is the slave of a Roman Centurion and is called \\"witcheyes.\\"  When Derina comes to her and tells her that she must fulfill her destiny and save the prisoner that is kept in the dungeon Bryna does as she says but does not understand how the Dark prisoner has any connection to her, let alone how he could be her destiny.<br /><br />Tynan is known as the \\"Dark Chieftain\\" and he has a prophecy that he must meet.  He is chained naked in a dungeon and suffering when a cloaked figure comes and despite the danger helps him to escape.  It is not long before Tynan realizes that his rescuer is indeed the mate that he has been looking for.  Bryna is Fey and she is the territorial goddess that is meant for him.  Problem though is that Bryna has no idea who or what she is.  Despite this she trust Tynan and is drawn to his dark beauty and the safety and home that he represents.  Separate they are weak, but together they are strong.  Will they be able to defeat the evil sorcerer and find peace in which to love?  Or will Evil win?<br /><br />Ms. Gray is an exceptional author and one that paints a vivid picture with her words.  The reader won't be able to help but be drawn into her magical world, nor will they be able to help falling a little in love with Tynan themselves.  This is a strong debut read and one that I have no trouble recommending.  I look forward to reading more from this author in the future.	2005-06-04

Although a little slow to start it eventually pulled this reader in with his vivid descriptions and details that place me directly into the time period.  Mr. Oden has set his book Egypt borderlands in 520 B.C.  It goes without say that this is not a time period, or location many choose to set their stories.  As a result the fans of historical fiction have something new and fresh to pick up!<br /><br />Barca the Phonenician he is the leader of the Medjay who are the guardians of the Egyptian Frontier.  Barca is a product of his past.  Years earlier he caught his wife being unfaithful.  His rage was such that in one moment he managed to kill both his wife and her lover.  He is still gripped by this tragic event.  As a result he is an unstoppable force on the battlefield. Will this hold him in good stead and offer Egypt the warrior that she needs, or will the love of a good woman tame that beast that rages within?<br /><br />Mr. Oden is a talented author and is a shining jewel in the Medallion Press crown.  This book touched on all my emotions.  Mr. Oden has a gift for storytelling and I truly felt transported back in time.  I look forward to reading Mr. Oden in the future and I highly recommend \\"Men of Bronze.\\"  You won't look at historical fiction the same at the end of the read.	2005-06-04

Ms. Scottoline's latest thriller is indeed a superb example of what a fast-paced well told story could offer the fans of this genre.  This story starts off with a bang and ends just as dramatically with an ending that will surprise readers.<br /><br />Assistant U.S. Attorney Vicki Allegretti has an appointment with a confidential informant on a case that she is currently working but instead walks into a nightmare that ends with the death of one pregnant woman and her partner Bob \\"Morty\\" Morton.  What should be a cut and dry case turns into something that Vicki could not even dream up in her most outrageous imagining.  She will have her faith tested in friends, and co-workers, question the integrity of the one man she loves but doesn't think will ever be hers and risks bringing a scandal to the office that she holds.  She also will join forces with a very a very driven woman named Reheema in the quest for truth about the death of her mother.  Could these cases be linked to a drug circle and what will be the implications once the dust has settled and the players have all been unveiled?  Will Vicki be able to untangle the lies and find the truth, and more importantly will she be able to handle the truth once she faces it?  Or will the truth destroy all that she has worked towards?<br /><br />Again this was a high-octane read that will totally engross the reader.  Ms. Scottoline is a highly talented author and her twelfth effort aptly demonstrates why she is on the New York Times best-selling author's list.  This is one read that you won't want to miss.	2005-06-04

Tess is strong and he will be willing to do what he must...even stand back in order for him to win the one prize he must have...Tess!<br /><br />Tess and Anthony are fun and realistic characters. Tess is not a milk and water miss but rather a woman that knows her own mind. Anthony on the other hand is strong enough to step back and let his lady shine.

Ms. Hunter has a fine start to her new series under her belt with her latest effort.  She has created very entertaining characters and put them into very interesting situations.

But what will happen when he finds out that the bride wasn't jilted as he thinks?  Will he still follow his heart or will he let pride ruin his chance for happiness?<br /><br />This was a very entertaining story.  The only problems that I found was there were several times when modern day terms and words were used.  This pulled me from the historic time period and was a bit de-railing.  Aside from that this was a fine romance.  Grayson and Jane were fun characters and we were introduced to several other charactres that will play a roll in the upcoming stories.  Ms. Hunter is off to a fine start with this read.	2005-05-25

Still, with this said, Ms. Davidson's contributuion was shorter than short...was a continuation to a story that I haven't read...and was unsatisfiying for this reader.<br /><br />Melissa Schroeder's \\"Seducing the Saint\\" was a story about two people getting a chance to get it right the second time around...while looking for Libby's dad who is looking for the legend of the Snake King.  This trip though will be more than either Libby or Brady dreamed it could be.<br /><br />Camille Anthony's story \\"Carte Blanche\\" is a debut effort and my favorite out of the three.  Chastity lives a life of privilage and has to marry.  She won't go quietly giving her heart to any man.  But than again Darian isn't just \\"any man.\\"<br /><br />Again this was an entertaining read.  My only complaint...Ms. Davidson's read was less than satisfying.  In fact it was the shortes of the three.  All three offer fun futuristic backdrops, and of course plenty of steamy chemistry between the main characters.  Overall, I wouldn't buy this book simply because of the headline author...but I wouldn't recommend that you skip it either.  Bottom line.  This is an easy read that is portable.	2005-05-22

So far this read has been my favorite in the \\"Brotherhood of the Sword\\" series.  Christian of Acre is a wonderful hero who will touch the reader.  Adara is a perfect complement to him and their romance is touching to read.<br /><br />Christian of Acre is known as the Abbott to his fellow breathern.  His job...keep those safe that can't do for themselves.  He has known love from his parents, and he is also more than familiar with the pain of it's loss.

For doing so could cost him more than he is willing to give.  He doesn't want the responsiblites of being King to Adara's Queen and ruling a country he doesn't even call home.  But Adara won't take no for an answer.  Instead she sets seige to his heart knowing there can only be one outcome.  She must win.<br /><br />Adara has forever kept in her heart the one memory of Christian.  She longs to know the love that she knows he can give.  Her childhood was fraught with pain and suffering.

Truth be told, she has always felt something for the mysterious Jamie.  Men have never measured up to him.  But failure on her mission is not an option.  Now if she can only gain Jaime's trust and maybe, just maybe capture the heart of the one man she has ever loved.<br /><br />Every once and awhile the loyal fans and readers of romance are treated to a romance hero that will live with them long after the romance is finished.  Jamie Creed can now be added to that illustrious list.  Ms. Foster's latest effort has been well worth the wait.  \\"Jamie\\" is without a doubt my favorite in the \\"Visitation Series\\" and for readers that have been waiting for his story, you won't be sorry.  Plot, pacing, and characterization are top drawer.  End result you will have a wonderful book to escape into filled with old friends, and one sensual romantic storyline between Jaime and Faith.  I highly recommend this read and any other titles on Ms. Foster's backlist.	2005-05-20

I have had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Love and as a result was able to see her quirky nature in her great characters.  This only made the read more entertaining.<br /><br />Ellie Stepp is not perfect, at least not in her opinion.  She's a little chubby, a little short, and a librarian.  Could she be a sadder stereotype?  She is living in her small Maine hometown and life is good, at least by Ellie standards.  It could be better but...than at her sisters wedding reception the unthinkable happens...Mason Sweet the object of her childhood love, and Millbrook's very handsome mayor flirts with her...on purpose!!  Her, Ellie Stepp.  Something must be wrong.  Way wrong.  But actually everything is very right.  At least it will be once she manages to get her act together.  Than she finds out that one of the towns leading citizens wants a new football field at the libraries expense.  Ellie screws up her courage and asks Mayor Sweet to help her.  He will...but it's going to cost her...<br /><br />Mason can't believe that he is seeing Ellie in a whole new light.  She is beautiful, giving, and warms him like no one else has in a long time.  When she comes to him for help, he makes a rather indecent proposal...and is floored when she agrees!  Well, he can handle this...no problem.  Right?  Well, it won't be an easy relationship given that it must be kept secret from the town and Ellie's sister.  But than nothing worth having ever comes easy right?<br /><br />Ellie and Mason are wonderfully real characters.  Ellie has more issues than vogue magazine when it comes to security and self-confidence.  Mason has a tendency to bury his pain in a bottle.  Each of them sees the best in the other, and their relationship is sweet as a result.  This is a read that will speak to your emotions and one that I highly recommend.	2005-05-19

I loved that story and fell in love with the concept of \\"gothic romance.\\"  Sadly this seems to be a sub-genre that has been largely neglected as of late.  I'm glad to see that there are still some author's out there that want to pen a fine gothic romance.  Ms. St. Giles has done so and as a result my need for a finely written gothic has been fed.  This is a true gothic read right from the get-go.  Dark and brooding hero, young and idealistic heroine that just so happens to be a...yep you guessed it a governess and you have the backdrop for this read.<br /><br />Ann Lovell is a well-educated woman for the times and her station in life.  She is a laundress and longs to do something else with her time.  She loves to read and thanks to her mother had a well-rounded education.  As a result when she sees a notice for the post of governess at Trevelyan Manor, she snatches it without thought.  Her goal...to get the position.  She will totally overlook the gossip and whispered things that surround the mansion on the hill.  She has always been drawn to the house, and now she will work there.  The gossip about the death of the young mistress of Trevelyan is just a bunch of rot.<br /><br />Benedict Trevelyan is your protypical Alpha dark hero for this sub-genre.  He has buried his pain deep inside but at the same time has managed to turn his back on the needs of his family.  A tragedy took place a year earlier and it has shaped the members of this family in ways unthinkable.  But the light that Ann (Tatiana) brings to their dark existance can't be ignored.  Knowing that he shouldn't feel things for his sons governess doesn't stop him.  From one kiss to a full blown affair Ann and Benedict try to come to terms with the past while looking forward to the future.  But will they get that future or will a dark presence take it away from them?<br /><br />This was a finally written romance.  Ms. St. Giles did a very fine job drawing out the sensual tension between Benedict and Ann.  Secondary characters were important to the plot and Ann's interaction with them all helped move the story forward.  The setting was perfect as 1873 San Francisco (or any time period for that matter) easily transformed into a location that was mysterious and dark.  This is one read that I highly recommend and I look forward to her next effort.ing out the sensual tension between Benedict and Ann.

Ms. Gerard has started her \\"Bodyguards\\" series with a fine story that will keep the reader firmly engaged.  This is truly a fine read but readers should be aware that although this is billed as a \\"romantic suspense\\" the romance is slowly built, but whoooee is the chemistry between Nolan and Jillian hot.  As a result romance readers may feel a bit cheated.  This is truly a complex story and one that should be picked up.<br /><br />Jillian Kincaid is a rich girl who has made it on her own merits as a newscaster.  She is also being stalked by someone that wants her dead.  Her father a well known publisher decides to take matters into his own hands and hires a bodyguard to keep Jillian safe.  Enter ex-Ranger Nolan Garrett.<br /><br />Nolan Garrett is strong, tough, and haunted.  He feels that he has let down too many people over the course of his military career and is dumbfounded when his brother comes to him requesting his help with a case.  since family is important Nolan takes the case.  What he expects Jillian to be is totally not what she is.  She's strong, gusty, and scared to death.  She also speaks to the wounded man that he is.  Will he be able to keep her safe from not only himself but the stalker?<br /><br />Again, this was a fast paced read that will enthrall readers from the get go.  Ms. Gerard has created a rather nasty evil person that drives the story with little effort. This is one series that I'm looking forward to reading.	2005-05-16

For a debut effort this was a sweet story that shows that Ms. Long has great potential as an up and coming author.  She has created wonderful and dynamic characters that are both engaging and entertaining without being silly or trite.<br /><br />Rebecca Tremaine is a good girl but not the proper English lady that most aspire to be.  She has more important interests such as medical and healing questions rather than how to sing a perfect song, or stitch a perfect stitch.  When a night of mistaken identity has her compromised by a dandy, the only course of action is to...runaway with the stable hand, Conner Riordan (who just so happens to be a Duke hiding from responsiblity and is thought dead) so she can make a life for herself else where.  While on the run from highway men, her love sick suitor, and a scheming Duchess (Conner's sister in law) Conner and 'Becca find that they love each other no matter what and will do all they can to have a happy ending.  But will they or will honor and responsiblity keep them from that goal?<br /><br />Conner and Rebecca are fun characters.  There romance is sweet and their relationship is slowly built over a course of years so...there is added depth here.  There were some slow parts to the story, and the Duchess storyline, although has potential falls short.  Still this was a sweet story and for a debut effort shows great potential in the future.  I look forward to reading Ms. Long again in the future and suggest that you had her to the author's to watch list you may have going.<br /><br />(...)	2005-05-14

I think it's because they truly capture the nuances of what truly a hero is to many.  Ms. Melton has done a fine...no brilliant job creating a hero that many would not even want to bother with but can't help loving in the end.<br /><br />Gabe Renault is a SEAL and he is married to his job.  Oh, and married to a real life flesh and blood woman named Helen.  Problem though is Gabe gives a 100% to work but less than that at home.  Than he is sent on a mission from which he doesn't return.  Helen is told at first that he is MIA and than a year later that he is dead.  No sooner does she receive that word than her husband comes back from the dead.  He's alive but he can't remember the last three years.  Trouble with that...those were the years that he was married to Helen.  Now Helen wants nothing more to do with her wounded husband.  He has hurt her bad and her heart won't stand the pain anymore.  But she just can't turn her back on this \\"new\\" Gabe.  He's attentive, loving, and supportive.  Will he change once he get his memory back?<br /><br />Gabe has lived through a nightmare and it's not over yet.  He can't remember his last mission, the last three years of his life.  Now his memories are returning and they are dis-jointed and fragmented.  But one thing remains.  He can't remember what happened but someone thinks he can.  This results in him fearing not only for his life but his families as well.  Is he paranoid or are his fears real?  Just how far up the chain of command is involved in what took place one year earlier?<br /><br />This was a very fast-paced read that will take the reader on a roller coaster of emotions.  You will alternate between upset and joy with Helen and truly feel the frustration of Gabe.  The repair of their romance is...romantic and one of the better examples of why we read romance.  This is one read I have no trouble recommending.  I look forward to the next book in this series.	2005-05-13

If you are in the market for a good anthology look no further than Brava and their popular reads!  This book is no different and the combined talent of Lori Foster, Lucy Monroe, and Dianne Castell will have the reader wanting to pack their bags for Delicious, Ohio and the yummy hero's that can be found there!<br /><br />In Lori Foster's \\"Once In A Blue Moon\\" Gardner Stan Tucker has a problem that he has left Chicago over.  When there's a full moon he can hear the thoughts of others.  This is more than he can handle when sexy bookstore owner Jenna Rowan's over active mind screams her deep dark desire...for Stan.  Will he be able to convince Jenna that he wants her as much if not more and that it's not the moon's magic?<br /><br />Lucy Monroe's \\"Moon Magmetism\\" is the story of Ivy Kendell manager of the one inn in Delicious, Ohio.  Her problems start during the full-moon as she has a rather unique affect on electronic equipment.  There is no way she can work in a computer driven inn and when handsome, and sexy Blake Hawthorne shows up in order to convince her to update the inn he is taught a very important lesson in magmetism.  But, he's not the only one to teach a lesson.  Will he be able to convince Ivy that he wants her no matter the affect of the moon?<br /><br />Dianne Castell's \\"Moonstruck\\" is the story of recently divorced Julia Simon.

Well, she is in the market for her luck to change and after a wish and a ritual her wish comes true in the form of Marc Adams.  But will her luck change again once the Blue Moon is gone?<br /><br />All three stories were wonderfully fun and sensual.  There was not a stinker in the bunch.  Although the stories were short they were well told and well crafted.  This was the first time I've read Ms. Castell and I look forward to picking her reads up again in the future.

Ms. Porter's debut effort is what I'd call a charming read...if you can get past Holly and search for the mystical \\"Prince Charming\\" she thinks is out there.<br /><br />Holly Bishop thought she had it all. Handsome French husband...to die for wedding...oops...to die for divorce! What??? That was not suppose to be the end of her fairy tale. Now she has moved herself to San Francisco in an attempt to jump start her life. There she makes some memorable mistakes, as well as friends. She also finds out that there are more \\"toads\\" than true princes to be found in the dating pool. Add a nasty/want to be your friend boss and co-worker (think evil step-sister here in keeping with the fairy tale theme) and you have the makings for a different kind of read.<br /><br />This is actually a story about learning to stand on your own two feet instead of expecting someone (in this case prince charming) to do it for you. Holly was an interesting character. She managed to make me laugh, smile, cringe, grit my teeth, and roll my eyes. A wide range of emotions to be sure. Still her ever present search of a happy ever after was not in vane. And her story is one that probably eveyone can relate to at some point in their lives. I did get a little tired of the whole \\"fairy tale\\" theme after a while. Fan's of the genre of \\"chick Lit\\" now have another author to choose from. Ms. Porter's debut effort demonstrates that she does indeed have talent and her next efforts will be worth looking for.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-05-12

A long time fan of Ms. Graham I'm always amazed by her creativity and the setting that she has chosen for this read is not only original but fun.  I admit to not knowing a Samba from a rumba except that they are indeed dances that sound like a lot of fun.  As a result the reader is introduced to a lifestyle that is rather popular but unfamiliar to many and the perfect setting for this fast-paced romantic suspense.<br /><br />Shannon McKay runs a dance studio that has been not having the best of luck as far as it clients goes, two different woman fall dead from an overdose of drugs.  Are they related or two different problems with the same sad outcome?  She is warned at a dance competition \\"she's next.\\"  Next for what though?<br /><br />Quinn O'Casey as been asked by his brother to investigate the death of dance star Lara Trudeau.  He has had a personal relationship with her and doesn't think that she would kill herself.  Doug knows in his brother will be able to get to the bottom of it...especially when he introduces the fact that one of Quinn's last cases may have had a connection to Lara's death.  Quinn reluctantly agrees and finds himself taking dance lessons with Shannon being his teacher.  He is attracted to her and doesn't know if he should act on his feelings or shelve them until he can cross her off of his list of suspects.  It's a race against time before a killer strikes again.  Will he be able to figure out who is killing the dancers before Shannon becomes the next victim?<br /><br />This was a real fast-paced read that was entertaining and different.  Although there are quiet a few secondary characters I don't think that it's so many that the reader can't keep track.  Plenty of personalities is what keeps this from being too technical or bogged down.  Ms. Graham is an author that always delivers and this is a read that you won't want to miss!	2005-05-09

Ms. Mancusi has taken the concept of time-travel, the legend of King Arthur, and the sub genre Chick-lit and created a story that is entertaining.  This read offers plenty of laugh out loud and tender moments that readers will enjoy.<br /><br />Kat Jones finds herself transported back in time to King Arthur with the dubious task of saving Camelot.  Yes, that's what I said 21 century gal sent to change history.  The result of this bit of time travel is Kat finds love for the first time with the Knight Lancelot, and becomes good friends with Queen Guenevere.  She also brings a little of the 21st century back in time...and the world will never be the same again...in anytime period. In fact the ending is very clever and leaves open the possiblity for a sequal.<br /><br />For those that do not care for the first person POV be aware that this story is written from that point of view but done so in such a way that it's not obnoxious.  Kat although a bit much at some points in the story is still a fun character, and Lancelot is one yummy hero.  Trust me this is not your typical \\"King Arthur\\" legend and the developing relationship between Kat and \\"Lance\\" is darn right romantic.  This was a fun read and I look forward to reading Ms. Mancusi again in the future.<br /><br />(...)	2005-05-08

How many of us have eaten in restaurants or worked in a restaurant?  This book filled with wit and humor gives the reader an absolutely brilliant window in which to look through at the \\"other side\\" of the dining experience.  I have not laughed out loud in quiet sometime and my fellow plane passengers (I took this read with me on my trans-Atlantic flight to the States) probably thought I had a screw loose!  Having worked in the food service industry (Okay it was Kentucky Fried Chicken, but hey I was serving people right???) I was able to appreciate the humor.  If though, you are one of the few that have not served in this industry I still truly feel that you will be able to see the humor in this read.  If anything it will be very enlightening.<br /><br />I will give Mr. Galloway this he is fair put pulls no punches.  Whoever said truth was stranger than fiction knew what they were talking about.  Mr. Galloway is a very talented writer and has brought this small world to life.  This is one read that I highly recommend and on author that I feel will be going great places!	2005-05-06

Ms. McCarthy has taken a turn and added a new aspect to her contemporary romance reads by adding a touch of the supernatural.  Her ghostly characters although not headlining in the romance department do play a rather significant role in bring together two so opposite people that you can't help but to keep reading until the final page.<br /><br />Boston Mcnamara has been sent to small town USA in what he views as a punishement.  What has he done to deserve this?  Answer is he has no clue.  Add to this, he finds himself renting a haunted house, has a rather quirky land lady and oh, yeah, locked doors mean nothing to sexy Shelby.  Resident ghost tour guide.  Could life get any more complicated?  Well of course it could!<br /><br />Shelby is making ends meet by taking people around her small town on a personal guided tour of hunted houses.  Cuttersville is loaded with them and her grammy just so happens to own many of them.  She is in for the shock of her life when she brings her tour to \\"the white house\\" only to find it not haunted by spooks but instead occupied by one sexy man.  Of course Boston is not thrille to be caught without a stich on by Shelby and her faithful followers.  What follows is a wonderfully funny and moving read about thinking you know what you want only to find out you could not be more wrong.  But in a good way that is. Now if the ghost have their way there will be a happy ending for them both.<br /><br />Ms. McCarthy truly knows how to tell a story and how to create characters that a reader will feel attached to.

The murder mystery kept me guessing until the very end and the characters were wonderfully developed.  I loved Julie and Kevin not only was their relationship fun, but it was different.  I loved their dynamics. I would love to see Ms. Armstrong expand on their relationship in another story.  They are a great investigating duo!  Ms. Armstrong took great care and effort in creating her world so the reader will feel truly drawn into what's happening.  Julie is a very complex character and she made me laugh, and cry.  Or should I say I laughed and cried with her.  I highly, highly recommend Ms. Armstrong's debut read.  She provides plenty of edge of your seat reading.	2005-05-05

Readers should be prepared for the slow build up in the romance section of this read. Although this is billed as a \\"romance\\" I must say that I felt that this was more of a paranormal read with romantic overtones. Still Ms. Squire has taken the \\"vampire myth\\" and worked it in such a way that this story was fresh, fast-paced, and very dramatic. Ian and Beth our lead characters are strong, but sympathetic and as a result the relationship that develops between them is not only believable but this reader quickly turned the pages hoping that these two very different but deserving people found love.<br /><br />Ian was taken as a slave by the Barbary pirates sailing along the coast of Africa. Soon he is sold to a master that is cruel, and his servitude is marked by harsh punishment and a grueling trek through the desert in search of something that is beyond him. When they finally come to their destination amidst the sandy landscape of the North African desert he realizes that evil is not just his master Asharti a woman that is a creature of the night and that this place is the home of evil beyond his wildest nightmare. Just when he thinks his suffering is at an end one simple but crucial mistake changes Ian for the rest of his life. Now he has become that which he has despised and fought against. On his way back home to England he is about to meet his match. Where he only sees darkness a nature and sweet light has formed. But will Ian realize that even he deserves the one thing he never thought to have which is love and acceptance?<br /><br />Beth has lived her life in the desert. One quirk of fate changes all that. Her father has been killed in a tragic accident and now she finds that she must return to England and assume the ways of the genteel. She is a scholar, a blue stocking and this is the last thing that she wants. One board the ship that will take her to her destiny she meets a very unusual but handsome man that seems to be different. His explanations all seem possible but...it's not until she follows him one night in Spain that her questions are finally answered. Or at least a few are answered...more take their place, and she finds that no matter how hard she tries to be afraid of Ian...she still finds herself drawn to him. Do they even have half a chance at being happy?<br /><br />Ian and Beth were such complex characters and as a result they took control of the story and told their own tale. We are told of Ian's past through flashbacks, and this was a very effective way of \\"catching\\" the reader up with what had gone on before without slowing down the pace of the story. Ms. Squires has penned a very sensual read that will take readers from Dark Africa to Spain, England, and than back to Africa again for the amazing finish.

We were fist introduced to Joe \\"Bogie\\" Bogart and Sofia Marino in \\"Charmed.\\"  These two wonderful characters now have their very own story and romance.  This is also the last book in this series so all of the loose ends are tied up as well for Ms. Ciotta's faithful readers.<br /><br />Sofia Marino is the star of a hit television program called \\"Spy-Girl.\\"  Her real life though is about to resemble an episode from her television program in vivid Technicolor.  This is a very bad thing considering the fact that she wakes up in a shed, with bloody cloths on and only a cell phone and gun in her possession.  What makes this situation even worse is the fact that she has no memory regarding how she got there or more importantly why.  Not knowing what else to do, she contacts her brother-in-law Murphy (Charmed) asking for help.  Murphy is in no position to help her so he contacts his brother Joe to rescue the damsel in distress.<br /><br /> Joe has not idea what he's going to do with the hoyden but once he sees her he knows his easy stress free life is about to become a lot more...complicated.  He has had a thing for the fiery Sofia from the moment he first laid eyes on her.  Now that she is with him he can longer fight the attraction.  Oh... he tries mind you but the bigger they are, the harder they fall.<br /><br />Sofia can't believe that her brother-in-law could do this to her.  Doesn't he know that the sexy ex-special agent Bogart is the one thing she knows she shouldn't even get close too? With just one kiss he managed to awaken her heart and she hasn't been the same since.  Now as if things are not complicated enough in her life she has to trust him to help her solve the mystery of what happened to her and why.  At the same time keep an arms distance...yeah, that's going to be easy.  NOT!  Will these two be able to unravel the mystery that's locked inside Sofia's head before the bad guy targets Sofia or her family?<br /><br />This was a fun fast read.  Afia, Jake, Lulu, and Murphy, Rudy, and JP are all very important characters that fit in their very own secondary storyline.  All of the loose ends between Rudy and JP are sorted out, and we get a glimpse of what their lives (the whole gang) are going to be like in the future.  Sofia and Joe are wonderful romantic leads that truly complement each other.  Their courtship is rather unique but than again so are they.  I hated to see this series come to an end but Ms. Ciotta has done a wonderful job bringing it to a close.  She has created very vivid and memorable characters that will stay with the reader long after the final page is read.

Anyone who knows me knows I really don't gravitate naturally to \\"Chick-Lit.\\" This is not to say it's not any good...it is...but some of the offerings lately have not been brilliant. Or I should say the ones I've read have not been brilliant. Ms. Bolk's debut effort on the other hand is! This was a stomach hurting laugh out loud read that I highly recommend. Chick-Lit is really a genre that is defining itself and this is a perfect example of what this genre has to offer.<br /><br />Rory Egglehoff is an accountant who has an obsession with Star Wars, dating a nerd who's idea of \\"going out\\" is Dominoes Pizza, and a can of soda at home...normally Rory's apartment, and comes from a family that is...well, lets just say different. I don't want to give it all away. She is trying to come to grips with the fact that she will never be cool, never be sexy, and well...never have her earth rocked! Her earth though is about to move in ways she never thought possible. she is going to come face to face with her elementry school, middle school, and high school crush. Hunter Chase! Hunter is still just as handsome, still just as awe inspiring, and more importantly still out of her reach. Or at least she thinks he is until her best friend Alison get a hold of her. Now this wallflower is about to undergo a major transformation that will cause heads to turn, and ideas to shift. But will she find a happy ever after or rather her Hans Solo when the dust settles, and after the dreaded high school reunion?<br /><br />Take school geek, turned swan...add self doubt, good friends, a real guy that's a real hero...add a dash of the absured (because who's life doesn't have the tad bit of abusrd in it?) and voila you have \\"The Good...The Bad...\\" Ms Bolks is an amazing author who truly knows how to bring high school experiences into prespective and make you laugh while doing it. This is a debut effor that I highly recommend and I suggest that the reading community keep an out for this very talented author. She is goint to soar to top without any problems!ented author.

He is going to be a hero to India in every possible way.  Her homecoming is not going to be as scary as she first thought it would be.<br /><br />Jacqueline Navin's \\"Miss Jenny Alt's First Kiss\\" was the sweet story of a spinster who has been taken in as a poor relation and has helped to raise her cousin.  She has doted on the spoiled girl but has no idea what this will cost her until an Earl comes looking for a bride and sees behind Jenny's carefully made-up façade.

Shana Galen is an author that I feel fans of historical romance should add to their \\"watch and wait\\" list.  This debut effort was highly entertaining and I'm hoping that Ms. Galen lives up to her great start.  I'd be happy to visit again with any of the secondary characters and I'd love for her to write the romance of Francesca and Ethan! But first let's talk about Alex and Lucia, these two characters were wonderfully fleshed-out and simply came to life on the pages.  Alex and Lucia were wonderfully matched.<br /><br /> Alex is a spy, and Lucia is strong-willed, opinionated, and knows what she wants.  Or at least she thinks she does.  Than one family meeting later she is paired with her \\"brother-in-law\\" Alex, in the search for her missing twin brother John.  Of course Alex doesn't need or want the little minx anywhere near his investigation.  He can handle it.  But what he wants, and what he gets are two very different things. This search will lead these two on an unbelievable journey to both the continent and one into their very own hearts.  Will Alex finally realize before its not too late that love does not make a man a fool, but instead makes him stronger than he thought possible?<br /><br />This was a very good debut effort.  Ms. Galen has created a wonderful world filled with fun and interesting characters.  She managed to balance her storylines well, not cheating either the romance, or the spy intrigue storyline.  I highly recommend this debut effort and suggest that the reading community keep their eyes on this up and coming author.	2005-05-02

Her husband has a mistress and he is welcome to her if it means that he will leave Regina alone.  She is the daughter of a merchant and he managed to purchase a title for his daughter.  Problem is Regina is far from happy, but feeds her imagination by penning a romance of her own.  She's in trouble though, when her manuscript starts reflecting real life events.<br /><br />Prince Viktor Kazanov meets Regina in the most unlikely places.  She is refreshing and speaks to his rather cynical heart.  She is witty, beautiful, and strong. She has also found herself in a very difficult situation when her husband and Viktor's wife are found dead together.  Who murdered them and why?  Soon Viktor and Regina find themselves in a situation that will test their new found feeling, and just might bring an end to their happy ever after.  Will they find out who is killing people around them before one of them falls victim?<br /><br />This was a very sweet yet sensual read.  Regina is a very unique character for the time period and as a result this brought a fresh aspect to this storyline.  Add to that, the unusual situation where both of our protaginest are involved with other people.  Ms. Grasso has a wonderful gift for telling a story and this effort is no exception.

Ms. Martin has brought to the conclusion her Sinclair Sisters trilogy, and \\"Deep Blue\\" was a very good ending to a series that offered the reader fun locations, strong and determined heroines, and the perfect Alpha male hero to complement them.  This story was no different.<br /><br />I took this read on the airplane with my flight just flew by (pun not intended, sorry) and I was fully engaged as I searched for buried treasure with Hope and Conner, while staying one step ahead of a killer.<br /><br />Hope comes home to her apartment that has been torn apart by someone who seems to want to use this a warning to back off of the story that she was working.  Her fears are confirmed when her boss pulls her off of one story, and moves her to another one.  This one involves a treasure hunt, and Conner Reese.  Conner is a diver who is in search of a lost Spanish galleon and it's hidden treasure.  What he doesn't understand are the feelings he has for the sassy Hope.  She's trouble with a capital \\"T\\" and he can't stay away.  Will he be able to protect her from the danger that has followed her to the islands before a killer suceeds in ending Hope's life?  Will Hope and Conner finally allow themselves to find love with each other?<br /><br />This was a finally drawn story that truly had several different storylines going, but in the end they tied together.  Hope was a great character and Conner was truly her equal.  Ms. Martin always delivers when she pens her romantic suspense reads, and this story is no different.  If you are new to this series, fear not...this is a strong stand alone read.  On the other hand if you have been reading all of these books from the first than you won't want to miss this one.

There are already married but have fallen into the trap that so many aristocratic couples fall into, duty, duty, duty, to the title that is held. This is a story is about falling in love all over again and realizing that life is too short to spend it playing games.<br /><br />Adrian Warfield is the Duke of Windmere. He has just been told by his team of physicians that he is dying. He won't make it to the end of the year and that he should really get his affairs in order. Or at least that's what he overhears. Knowing that his time is short he begins to take stock in his life. He is married to a dutiful and kind woman, but their relationship is not what it used to be. There was a time long ago, before the title was his that they laughed and shared things. Now they live the proper aristocratic life and he must consider what should be done to protect Miranda when his death occurs. They have not been able to produce a child and the title will be forfeited to a cousin. This situation weighs heavily on Adrian. He takes a trip to the country and soon Miranda follows. Their time in the country seems to change things. Miranda seems more beautiful and open then she had been before, and Adrian begins to realize that although they have grown apart there is a part of him that misses her badly. It's only a matter of time before this Duke realizes that he is in love with his own wife. His love motivates him to find a new husband for his Miranda. Can he do this without Miranda figuring out what he is up too?<br /><br />Miranda has come to terms with the way her life has played out. She knows that she would not have been the choice of the Dowager Duchess for her son Adrian. She tries very hard to be the wife that she thinks Adrian needs and wants. What she wants though is love, respect, and caring. Than all of a sudden Adrian seems to be spending more time with her and their physical relationship is changing...for the better what has brought on this change...and will it last or is it too good to be true?<br /><br />Adrian and Miranda were compelling characters. The fact that these two were already married at the beginning of the story made the storyline a little more unique. The concept of facing your own mortality is a very interesting vehicle for a storyline and Ms. Brisbin has made the most of it. I truly felt invested with the characters and the change in their relationship was sweet and tender to read.

Duncan is a Scotsman that knows who and what he wants...Willow. He is a true hero in every sense of the word. Willow is a complex character but eventually realizes that Duncan is the one for her. The suspense storyline surrounding the lobster contamination is entertaining without having to many slow moments. I enjoyed this read and highly recommend Ms. Chapman as an author.

This talented author takes the reader to Victorian England and with a mystery to solve wonderfully dynamic characters the reader is in for a treat.  BUT...readers may find fault with our moody, dark hero.  He plays the part of \\"beast\\" to perfection and as a result readers may be put off by Brian Stirling.  I recommend that readers give this book a fair chance.  Ms. Drake always delivers and this read is really no exception.<br /><br />Camille Montgomery has a less than stirling past.  Her mother was a prostitute that fell in love with a lord.  She dies early in life leaving her daughter alone and unprotected.  Camille is saved by a true friend Tristan and guardian.  Well, Tristan finds himself behind the walls of Castle Carlyle and in the \\"beast\\" clutches.  Camille goes to rescue her guardian but instead becomes a reluctant guest of the Earl of Carlyle.  It's not long before she becomes a pawn in a deadly game of revenge that could end badly.  But will Camille allow herself to finally see the gentleness in Brian, and be willing to help him end his pain?<br /><br />Brian Stirling is living a life of a recluse.  He wants revenge for the death of his parents and he thinks he knows who caused their tragic deaths but he can't be sure.  When Camille comes to rescue her guardian the perfect chance falls into his lap and he will use it if it means bringing an end to his pain.  Problem though is he reluctantly starts to feel things for the beautiful Camille, and what starts out as a ploy turns very real.  But, will this stubborn man realize it before it's too late?<br /><br />Brian and Camille are very interesting characters.  Again, most will probably be put off by Brian's gruff, and \\"un-hero\\" like qualities.  I beg the reader to give him a chance.  Throughout the story is tenderness, and goodness can be seen.  Camille is a fiesty and strong heroine, and more than able to hold her own.  This story is really almost \\"gothic\\" in nature.  I found it to be a good read and one I have no trouble recommending.  Ms. Drake is a very talented author and one that always delivers when penning a creative, and different romance.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]This story is really almost \\"gothic\\" in nature.

Ms. Kelly has penned another fast page turning read that fans of romantic suspense/paranormal romance will find very entertaining.<br /><br />Jody Dupree has been living life in the shadows waiting for the past to finally catch up with her present. Her friend Andrea is bound and determined that her friend have fun on her birthday.  She takes Jody to a strip club and there Jody meets her future.  Logan Hart is the first man that has moved her.  One naughty dance later they find themselves sharing one night that neither can forget.  Jody sneaks out while Logan sleeps but she can't run from her destiny.<br /><br />Logan is a newspaper reporter looking for the one story that will land him his dream job as editor.  His latest assignment calls for him to take on different jobs.  One job is that of stripper for one night.  This one job will lead him to the story of a lifetime and the one woman he can't get out of his head.  When he finds out that Jody is hiding something from him he will do what it takes to find out what has his beautiful lady scared.  Will he be able to balance the feelings he has for Jody with his need to write the story of the year?  Will Jody finally realize that she can allow people close to her without losing it all?<br /><br />This was a very steamy read with dynamic and compelling characters.  This is without a doubt a stand alone read even though it's the second part of a series.  In other words you won't be missing anything accept another good read if you've not read \\"Southern Comfort.\\"  Jody and Logan are wonderful protaganists and there story is very emotional.  I love stories like that.  Ms. Kelly is an author I think we should keep our eyes on.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-04-18

Ms. Cole has taken a different direction for her third effort and as a result we've left the high seas, and this book is set in the country of Andorra.  This was fun as not many books are set in this small country and the history that it has is not only unique but interesting.<br /><br />Annalia is a strong woman that has much to loose.  Her small country has been put right in the middle of a military conflict and her family lines have made her a political pawn.  Her brother is being held by her enemy Pascal.  Pascal wants to rule and he knows that his claim will be made all that more strong if he marries Annalia since she is a descendant to the Castilian line of Spain.  Annalia wants to live a quite life and is concerned about the fate of her brother.  One day on the way home from a walk she happens upon a beaten man.  Recognizing him as a Scot she takes the chance and brings home the severely injured man.  If he turns out to be the mercenary she thinks he is...she will simply kill him herself if he brings harm to her small holding in any way shape or form.  What she doesn't know is that Pascal has turned on Court and he will do all that he can to prevent him from succeeding in his quest.<br /><br />Court MacCarrick's family has been cursed.  He has turned to the work of mercenary in order to fill his coffers.  When Pascal orders him killed he does the only thing he can in order to survive.  He jumps to his \\"death\\" into a river.  Washed downstream he is saved by an \\"angel\\" only this angel has a sharp tongue and seems to be a bit of a shrew.  Still this does nothing to tame the attraction that burns between them despite how badly Annalia would like to believe otherwise.  The devil in Court though will not give quarter to the beautiful sharp tongued Annalia and he drives her to lengths that he can't understand in order to save her brother from the evil Pascal.  Court takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps Annalia before she can sacrifice herself to Pascal in marriage hoping to gain the release of her brother.  Together these two people work towards the same end, protecting Annalia and her brother while at the same time bringing an end to Pascal and his evil ways. Will Court and Annalia be able to bring an end to Pascal and will they accept their attraction or will pride stand in the way?<br /><br />This was a good read that was kept from being great due to our main characters.  I had problems with Annalia and her attitude throughout the read.  Although she is a strong character she rubbed this reader wrong.  Her actions at times seemed more petulant and spoiled than well thought out.  Prejudice kept her from seeing Court in any true light.  Court on the other hand at times was no better.  He would bait Annalia which in turn kept the spiteful behavior going.  I had to put this book down several times due to sheer frustration.  Still it was fun to read a book set in a location that for the most part is overlooked in historical romance fiction.  For that alone I give Ms. Cole high marks for \\"thinking outside the box\\" and using her creativity.  In the end I admit to not really caring what happened to these two characters.  Their stubborn nature took away from the romance of this read.  Secondary characters are colorful and plentiful and help to deflect some of the ridiculous actions taken by Court and Annalia.  Overall this is a fair read.  Come to this book with an open mind and you the reader should do fine.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]in marriage hoping to gain the release of her brother.

This story offers just that kind of read, but why not a higher score?  Annie.  Annie is a character that alternated between entertaining me and annoying me.  Not a good trait in a main character.<br /><br />Annie is a widow. A young widow who is trying to raise her two childeren off of the earnings she makes creating crafty items to be sold to the \\"city people\\" that come to the Hamptons for the summer.  She has a fixer-upper that is falling apart around her and she is still not over the death of her husband.  Enter her best friend Merlin.  Merlin has asked her to help him one night at a rather posh party he is doing.  Annie agrees despite her misgivings and need for cash.  She has a thing against the \\"snooty\\" people that will be there and she doesn't want to leave her kids alone with a sitter.  Still she goes and works and meets the most charming man in the world.  The first man that makes her heart beat a little faster.  Thom with an \\"H.\\"<br /><br />Thom is trying to find his place in life.  He has a mother who is all about pedigree's, a sister that has forgotten how to smile and have fun, and a girlfriend that is just not working for him.  Just when he thinks his party could not get any worse he is run over by a petit dark haired waitress.  Ann is just the person he's been looking for...now if only he can convince her to take a chance with her heart again and allow him to lover her as he wants.<br /><br />This is a complex love story to be sure.  One person trying to move on from a tragic death, one trying to live period.  Add two sweet little kids, a ghost, and a treasure hunt and you have \\"Hello, It's me.\\"  Now overall this was a good read but what kept it from being \\"Great\\" was Annie.  Again she has her issues but her growth was slow going.  The side story of husband Andre coming to Annie from the otherside was rather weak.  I truly expected a little more there with that aspect of the story.  Otherwise this was a light entertaining read you may want to add to your summer reading list.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]his was a light entertaining read you may want to add to your summer reading list. <br /> <br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-04-11

He is not good enough for the beautiful Caroline but he can't help but feel things for her.  Can she truly find the goodness in him that he thinks is long gone?  Can these two people find love and acceptance together?<br /><br />Rogan and Caroline are wonderful characters.  Their romance is slowly built and all the more sweet because of this.

Ms. Kurland is one of those rare authors that manages to pen a romance in such a way that you remember the read years later.  This is just such a read.<br /><br />Jake Kilchurn travels the world in search of unique gems for his little side business when he is not involved in the family holdings.  An errand that should have been...simple ends up being an errand that will change his life in ways he never imagined.  Upon looking at a picture of Artane Castle, Jake feels an undeniable pull.  He is much to grounded to believe any kind of nonesense of mystical pull and what have you. But when the deal that his father is trying to make with none other than Gideon de Piaget rests on his agreement to travel to Artane and see what is there he must agree.  Or at least he feels he does.  So said he packs his car and heads North.  One skidding car later he wakes up in 1200's Scotland and rescued by the most beautiful woman ever...<br /><br />Amanda of Artane knows that she must marry.  What she doesn't want is a husband that only sees what she can bring to his coffers.  She wants a man that will love her for her.  When she finds the weary traveller Jake she can't help but be drawn to his handsome visage.  To bad he seems to be a lackwit incapable of communicating, and lacking proper cloths.  Or is Jake more than he seems.  Despite knowing that she can never love him she still finds herself drawn to him.  He is kind to her brothers, kind to her...but more importantly he is not impressed with the material things she represents.  He sees her.  But can there growing love for each other be enough to span the problems that lay ahead of them?  Or will there love be strong enough to span time?<br /><br />Ms. Kurland has again written a very romantic story that left me both laughing and crying.  Every single one of her characters touched me.  From our handsome hero Jake, and Amanda one young lady way ahead of her time, to younger brother Montgomery.  But best of all we get to re-visit with Kendrick and Gen!  I love how she has brought back one of my all time favorite romance couples!

Ms. Wilson has created a wonderful little world made up of characters that are a combination of sweet to crazy.  There is never a dull day in the life of Bertie Bryd!  Still she manages to laugh, cry, and muddle through with a great sense of humor. The reader will do the same.  This is one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time!  This is basically a story about Bertie and her little corner of the world.  Sweet Meadow, Georgia sounds like a fun place to live...or at least escape to!<br /><br />Bertie drives a wrecker but she also acts as a taxi driver for Millie since she doesn't have a car (Millie is hilarious), is best friends with Mary Lou who is not always the brightest bulb in the package...and now Mary Lou is pregnant and Rex and she are getting married.  Bertie has also found a boyfriend.  Trouble with Jeff is she doesn't know much about him, but he's great looking.  He's also a stripper and a mill worker.  Than there's Arch, which is Pete's son.  This is a great part of the story and without giving anything away one of my favorites.  Than there is Pete himself.  He keeps showing up inside the house she's renting (okay, he owns it but he now calls a nursing home his home now) sometimes dressed, sometimes not...and there are the times that he and his nursing home friends place the crank calls and what have you.  Still Pete becomes a fixture of sorts around Bertie's home.  And this is just a few of the characters that enrich this great story!<br /><br />This story made me laugh, and cry!  I love stories that offer characters that the reader can relate to and identify with.  This story does just that.  Ms. Wilson's debut effort is amazing!  She is truly an author that bears watching in the future.  Medallion Press has managed to add another wonderful jewel to their crown!

Although Ms. Hill teases us for now, this is the last in her Cajun series.  As a result readers are treated to Rene's story which has been long in coming but worth waiting for.<br /><br />Rene is a burned out lobbyist for the Louisiana wet-lands.  He is at his home-a-way from home deep in the bayou when two well meaning people drop off his worst nightmare.  Val Breaux.<br /><br />These two people have a past from way back...to the ripe old age of 15.  One foiled night of romance, one too many pink slo Gin Fizz's and well...let's just say not a fond memory for either for waaaay different reasons.  Now they are adults, they still burned for each other but have too much pride, or do they.  In any event there is a whole kidnapping for publicity thing that Rene has been dragged into, and a misunderstanding or two to sort out.  Once this is done do Val and Rene stand half a chance to make their relationship work?<br /><br />Rene and Val are both very dynamic characters. They are both too proud, have crazy families to deal with, and of course their attraction that is anything but tame.  This story brings back all of the old friends that we've been introduced to throughout this series.  Ms. Hill deftly combines humor, romance, and rather serious issues into a read that will captivate readers.  I highly recommend Ms. Hill if you are a fan of fun light romances.

Normally I shy away from the more steamier reads as it's been my experience the \\"steam\\" is more for shock value than for any true part of the story telling.  Ms. Templeton though, is the exception to that rule.  She has penned a very sensual, romantic read that will bind the reader to the pages.<br /><br />Arlie and Dominic are compelling characters that the reader will care about, and as a result, will invest time in reading to see how their story plays out in the end.  Their passion is slowly built and all the more believable as a result.  The reader is not left asking...\\"where did the plot go?\\" as the storyline is not only moving, but entertaining.<br /><br />Characters are always important in any story and Arlie, Dominic, Daniel, Veronica, and the rest of the cast are truly fun characters.  Dominic is so tortured but at the same time so constrained by not only society rules, but his own personal rules, that he gets all tied up in knots.  Arlie on the other hand is a perfect complement for him.  She is sweet, innocent, and caring.  Just the kind of person our dark hero needs.<br /><br />This is the second book I've read by Ms. Templeton and I can honestly say I'm looking forward to reading her again in the future.

I have come to the conclusion that the sub-genre \\"Chick Lit\\" is an acquired taste and one that perhaps only comes with time...a long time to be exact.  Actually that's not fair to say, I've read several books within this genre and have been thoroughly entertained.  \\"Love: A User's Guide\\" was mildly entertaining with a fun premise.  The fact that I lived in England for several years aided in my understanding of several scenes and I did indeed see the humor.<br /><br />Overall this is an average read.  Amy is your pro-typical \\"chick-lit\\" heroine.  A little ditzy, confused about exactly what will make her happy, and clueless as to how to go about getting \\"it.\\"  She thinks that spouting nonsense and pretending to be chic will do the trick.  When confronted by having a handsome hunk of a movie star having a crush on her...plain Amy she chooses to again act the flake...not understanding Orlando's need for privacy.  This is where I thought of the movie \\"Notting Hill.\\"  Loved the movie, loved the concept...problem here was execution of the concept and the style of writing.<br /><br />This story did have a tendency to wander...but again this does seem to be \\"normal\\" within this genre.  So that didn't bother me...much.  Although this read was entertaining it's not one that would have gone out and bought new.  Thank heaven's I had the forethought to purchase this read second hand.  Ms. Naylor does have potential as an author.  I'm not sure where this effort falls (is it her first effort, or fifth?) in her writing career but she has room for improvement and this is a good thing.  Author's that start off with a bang tend to loose their drive early on.  Bottom line...this is not a read or an author to avoid, but I suggest that you come to this read with an open mind, remember this is not a brain surgery read and you will perhaps be okay.  Chick-lit is a popular genre for a reason but it's not for everyone.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-04-02

I have had the chance to live in England and for me it was a wonderful experience being around so much living history.  As a history major in college I threw myself into my studies enjoying British history the most.  A good friend recommend that I pick up this read saying I would never look at Richard the same again.  With a great deal of misgivings I purchased this book.  After all you really can't rewrite history.  This is without a doubt one of the most moving historical fiction reads I've picked up in a very long while.<br /><br />Richard has been maligned over the centuries. Never would you think that a man capable of such horror's could find such a strong and long lasting love.  I knew that he had married his Anne but I was not privy to what their romance could have been like.  This was a small window into a very murky past that sheds just a little light on \\"what could have been.\\"  Without a doubt the times were turbulent and war was constantly being waged.  This was a fine read that will take the reader back to England during the reign of Edward IV.<br /><br />This is an incredibly rich read with descriptions that were amazing.  You can truly tell that Ms. Worth did her research.  I truly look forward to continuing on with this series.  This was an all encompassing read so be ready to be transported back to a time that no longer exists to see the childhood of a King that has perhaps been a bit misunderstood.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-04-01

I admit to coming to Ms. James in a rather round about manner.  This is only the second story by her that I've read (the first being in an upcoming anthology and loved the story) and lets just say the jury's still out on a verdict.  Will I read her again?  Probably, but I think I'll see what reviewers have to say first.<br /><br />This was a fun story don't get me wrong.  One man at a house party filled with...lets's just say rather different women, one being our \\"heroine\\" and you have the makings for a fun story.  Problem though is there is not just one story within these pages...there are several. Three to be exact. Three stories with three sets of characters that have been building from past books.  What this means to me is that this is not a \\"stand alone read.\\"  In other words you should probably pick up the other titles before attempting this one. As a result this reader was spending most of her time trying to piece together things that would have been clear to faithful fans.  This was distracting and took away from the fun of the read.<br /><br />Overall Ms. James has penned a rather unique read that fan's of historical romance can enjoy.  She thought a little out side the box and for readers that have issues with this...well, you should keep this in mind.  I have no troubles trying to catch up when reading a series out of order (I do it all the time) but this time it bothered me.  Perhaps because I truly felt as if I was missing something.

Ms. Monroe has delivered another good read for fans of rather steamy romance that offers plenty of alpha males and strong women to handle them.<br /><br />This set of stories revolve around three half brothers that come to terms with their personal lives in rather unique ways.  Without going into great detail these are stories that build off of each other.  As a result you may not want to skip any one story as background is offered in each.  The problem with this is that not much background is given and this portion of the stories suffer.  All three men have a less than steller model to follow when it comes to dear 'ol dad and this affects their actions when finding love.  Otherwise this with the exception of that small part these were a fun set of stories.  Very easy to pick up and put down without loosing track of what's going on.<br /><br />Lucy Monroe is a very talented author and one that I think readers of romance should keep an eye on.  She tends to pair opposite and their attraction is always steamy.  I look forward to reading Ms. Monroe in the future and recommend that you might want to add this book to your \\"must read\\" list.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-03-30

Ms.Bennett is an author that I truly have no problems recommending.  Her reads are always entertaining, the hero's are always yummy, and she manages to pair them with the most extrodinary of females.  This story is no different.<br /><br />Vivianna Greentree's life in the beginning was not a happy one.  Kidnapped and than abandoned with her two little sisters they were mercifully taken in by the kind and generous Lady Greentree.  Lady Greentree raises these three little girls as if they were her own flesh and blood.  Vivanna though never forgot the fact that she was indeed an orphan and eventually her path leads her to helping care of orphans as an adult.  Her safe haven for children left behind though is threatened when one selfish lord takes it into his head to tear the building a down.  This just won't do so Ms. Greentree heads off to London in order to change the mind of the gentleman. If this means she must seduce him, than seduce him she will.  Once she learns how that is.  Lord Montegomery has no idea what his fate has in store for him.<br /><br />Oliver has his own reasons for closing the property that is housing the children.  He plans on making good his promise to find them a new \\"home.\\"  He is after a murder and he just knows that the answers he's looking for are in the building known as Candlewood.  When confronted though by the beautiful and sassy Vivianna he is dumbfounded by his reaction to her.  She is seducing his senses and he might not every recover them.  Will he be able to find a killer and the passion that he has found with Vivianna?<br /><br />Vivianna and Oliver are well matched protaganist.  This is really a combination of historical romance with a dash of suspense added to keep thing entertaining.  Ms. Bennett has done a find job setting up her new series without taking away or derailing the current story.  My only complaint is in the confrontation between Oliver and the \\"bad guy.\\" In many ways this was a little bit of a let down. Secondary characters are very engaging and add just the right amount of umph to the story. This was a very good read that I have no problems recommending.  I look forward to the next in this series and wait not so patiently for it to be released.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]characters are very engaging and add just the right amount of umph to the story.

I was so suprised when I found out that one of my favorite historical romance authors had switched gears and genres!  My first thought was...\\"a contemporary romantic supsense read?  No way!\\"  WAY!  Ms. Enoch has mangaged to switch gears without missing a step.  The end result is a rather funny but entertaining read that you won't want to miss out on.<br /><br />Sam Jellico is a thief.  She has her standards but she's a thief none the less.  She has just broken into Rick Addison's home.  She is there for one item, and one item only.  What she ends up getting is caught and not in the way you think.  One minute she's almost home free...the next she is saving rich Rick from being blow sky high.  Problem with this is she is now considered a suspect in the death of a security guard. She has only one witness to the fact that she didn't kill anyone...if anything she saved a life, and that witness is...yup, you guessed it Rick. Wull she be able to convince this handsome Brit that they can and should work together to figure out just who on earth wants Rick dead?<br /><br />Rick should have been in Germany...instead he's home and right in the thick of things when BAM!  His life is turned upside down.  He knows that his lady thief is not responsible but the police think otherwise.  Than the minx breaks in AGAIN and offers to make a deal with him.  Should he get himself tied up with the beautiful thief or should he take his chances with a killer?<br /><br />This was a very fast read!  Samanatha and Rick are great characters.  Both are strong willed and used to being in charge.  It was fun to read about them falling in love while hunting for a sick would be murder. Ms. Enoch has taken on the genre of romantic suspense and has done so with style.  I highly recommend this read and this author.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-03-27

It was not as sensual as some of her other reads and the interaction between the two main characters, Marcus and Kate although rather frequent was not as consistent as it could have been.  The end result was a rather uneven read with this reader finding it difficult to see when exactly the two characters had a chance to fall in love.  When not pondering this issue we had to deal with nasty vindictive creatures that truly give \\"women\\" a bad name.  Thoughtless, greedy, power hungry, selfish...and this was just one person.  There were several others that shared some of the same traits.  I understand that there must be conflict to keep the \\"couple\\" apart but hello...three is just a tad too much.<br /><br />Kate is the daughter of an Earl whose wife ran off with her lover and left said father in the dumps.  As a result dad kills himself and Kate is left to the tender loving care of her \\"aunt\\" Regina.  A nastier piece of work never existed.  So now we have an Earl's daughter filling the role of companion to another spoiled brat...the daughter of Regina, Melanie.  To make a rather long story short...this family heads off for London in order for Melanie to marry Marcus our hero.  But one love potion later taken by Kate and one stubborn man (Marcus) leads these two lonely people on a bumpy road to love.  Of course there will be the odd issues thrown at these two and don't forget stubborn natures.  In the end there is a happily ever after...or is there?<br /><br />Kate and Marcus were less than inspiring characters.  Ms. Holt is the queen of having two different storylines going at the same time and this book is no different.  Cousin Christopher and half sister Selena add a depth to this story that increased the readability rather than the opposite.  Problem with this is Christopher and Selena are the ripe ages of 18 and 16.  Hmmm...one must wonder what Ms. Holt was thinking there.  Is this a story to avoid?  No!  Ms. Holt has managed to write a book that is entertaining but not earth shattering.  As a long time fan of Ms. Holt I can say that this is not one of her BEST reads but it's far from her worst.  For those that like to read a sensual read...Ms. Holt has toned it down for this book.  Still this is spicier than your average romance read so fans watch out!  I highly recommend Ms. Holt and suggest that you look at her backlist as well.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]write a book that is entertaining but not earth shattering.

Ms. Hagan Lee's \\"Hardly A Husband\\" is another very good read in the \\"Free Fellows League.\\"  This is Jarrod's story and it will captivate the reader just as the previous stories have.<br /><br />Jarrod has been bound to an oath that he made in childhood to the Free Fellows.  He has been living life enjoying what it has to offer knowing that he will never marry.  That is until a childhood friend or pest comes back into his life asking for \\"seduction\\" lessons.  What's a gentleman to do now?  Although he would love to debauch the lady, he can't since he has made a vow never to marry and Sarah is everything that he has hoped to avoid in life.  Marriage, commitment...heirs...but Sarah touches him and he finds out that love is not as scary as he thought it was but will he realize this too late?<br /><br />Sarah has only one more choice in order to save her aunt and herself.  She has been displaced from her home and she has only three weeks to find a husband before one is found for her.  She wants to take control of her destiny and goes to her childhood love Jarrod.  If she can talk him into doing what she wants she will finally get her hearts desire.  Jarrod.  It's a gamble but she thinks she can pull it off...maybe.<br /><br />This was a very good addition to this series and found Jarrod and Sarah to be very engaging characters.  I love a story where the main characters already have a past.  It was fun to revisit with old friends and Jarrod and Sarah's romance was sweet and tender.

Ms. Low's latest read is again fast paced with plenty of action, romance, and suspense too keep the reader firmly engaged.  The topic of this story though is a touchy one and it's the concept of child prostitution and slavery.  As a result of this the book is very enlightening and there is truly no slow parts to this story.<br /><br />Jazz Zeringue is a Navy SEAL and he has seen and done it all.  He also has a deep appreciation for females and one is being mistreated he jumps in with both feet to save the day.  He does just this when he is arrested in an Interpol sting.  It also brings him directly into the sphere of Vivi Verreau.  Only problem is Vivi is not what or who she seems.  Will Jazz be able to rescue this damsel...even if she doesn't realize that she's in distress?<br /><br />Vivi has a past that she is trying desperately trying to come to terms with.  She works hard for GEM and trying to bring an end to child prostitution.  She is also involved in a new mission and she will be calling the shots.  What she was not counting on was leading the team that Jazz is a member of never mind the attraction that she feels for him.  Will she be able to get through this mission with her heart still intact?<br /><br />Vivi and Jazz are wonderful characters as are the secondary characters that pepper the pages.  This was a fast paced read that will draw the reader in from the beginning.  There is enough tension and suspense to satisfy any appetite.  Ms. Low is a very gifted author and one that I have no trouble recommending.<br /><br />Offical Reviewer for [...]	2005-03-23

The death of her husband sets her on a new path. A path that will challenge her and bring secrets out and heal relationships that have been long neglected due to lack of understanding and effort. At one point she considered suicide but a motto she sees in an antique store, and an article she sees in a magazine brings back to life the memory of an old flame and the bad way things ended with them. Mary feels compelled to go back to Paris and see if she can find her first love and fix what went wrong so many years earlier. Can you go back to the past and find what you left behind? Or will faith in how things should have been what keeps things on track?<br /><br />The relationship between Mary and her daughter Liz as well as Liz's relationship with her fiance Jeff are intricate and the motivation for this story. Readers will be taken on a rollercoaster ride of emotions with this story. I highly recommend Ms. Whitson's latest effort.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-03-15

I have not laughed this hard during a read in a very long time.  This book is full of quirky characters, situations you hope you will never run into and a romance that startes off in the most unexpected place.<br /><br />Pete is trying to put together a nice funeral for her grandma, continue on with the fourth of July celebration that her town hosts and keep a smile on her face all the while.  Well, that would be easy IF...when looking to put a mess of catfish into the freezer she didn't happen to see the frozen dead body of one of her late grandfather's mistress.  She and her best friend are trying to come to terms with what they just saw...and more importantly what to do with it when enters Danny.  Danny is her brothers divorce lawyer...he's there to start those proceedings but steps into the a bigger mess than he ever dreamed possible.  Just when things can't get any worse...the dead body up and disappears.  Add to this the rest of Pete's family showing up and chemistry between the playboy of the year (rumors are an ugly thing) and Pete's life has just gotten a tad more complicated.  Can Pete and Danny find a common ground and quite time to see if their feelings are more than steamy lust?  Oh, and just where did the dead body go?<br /><br />This book is not brain surgery but it's fun.  Ms. Buckley has created a very fun world to visit with characters that will make you smile and at time laugh out loud.  Pete and Danny are a fun set of protaganist and their romance although not as steamy as the Florida Panhandle summer is sweet and not with out it's moments.

Ms. Ashley's story \\"Night's Kiss\\" offers the reader a multiple feast of genre's that will appeal to almost every reader.  There are vampires (our hero Roshan DeLongpre) a witch (our heroione Brenna Flanagan), time travel, and even a small amount of humor, and a contemporary setting.<br /><br />Roshan has lived for centuries and he is tired of living alone.  He is in the process of thinking about ending it all when he takes a walk about his house and browse's his library one more time.  He finds a book that has the story of Brenna Flanagan a woman burned at the stake for witchcraft.

The problem most readers will always find within an anthology is the shockingly short stories that they include.  The reason for this is one, they need to give each author a far amount of pages, and two generally anthologies are a way to introduce new talent by drawing the reader in with a well-known author. This anthology though features three well-known and popular authors within the romance genre.  Why is this a problem?  The answer is simple we the reader are used to their full-length efforts so we feel cheated by the fact that each story is less than 100 pages.<br /><br />All three stories are good although Melanie George's effort was my least favorite by far.  I felt that the ending was too rushed and that this story would have been much better if given a long page count.  There was simply to much crammed into too few pages.  Otherwise all three stories offered yummy alpha male hero's, fun story lines, and of course great chemistry between the hero and heroine.<br /><br />If you are \\"new\\" to any of these authors this is a great introductory read.  If on the other hand you've read these authors don't expect to be blown away, but do expect a fun and entertaining way to spend a few hours.  Final assesment...I would recommend this read but would caution readers to lower there expectations just a tad and remind them that these are SHORT stories and to keep this in mind when diving between the pages.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-03-12

What kept it from being a \\"Great\\" read was the fact that the reader might feel as if they have come into the middle of an on going story between our two main characters Olivia and Davenport.  As a result their romance was a little less than full-filling since this reader felt as if she had missed out on something important with their past interaction.<br /><br />This read was peppered with very good chemistry between Olivia and Davenport, a mystery surrounding a family heirloom that has a particularly nasty curse attached to it, and a search for Davenport's younger brother.  Combine all of these aspects and you have a very good read.<br /><br />I recommend this book but suggest that if you are new to Ms. DaRif you might want to pick up her first book \\"The Tiger's Mistress\\" as I feel that some of the missing pieces may be found here.

Ms. Blackwell has indeed penned a story that was exceedingly good and one that this reviewer highly recommends.<br /><br />Carley has not had an easy life. Abused as a child and than a delinquent in her teens she manages to get her act together in a group home and becomes a teacher. She thinks she has little money, no family, and is stuck putting up with the hypocrisy that comes working at the private academy she teaches at when a visit from a P.I. changes everything. She now has money, family and the freedom to stand up for her beliefs.<br /><br />Thinking she will just fly to Mississippi, sell off the house she has inherited before finding another teaching job back in San Francisco turns to staying in the charming southern town and putting down roots and getting to know family. She might even allow her heart to be touched by a man. With the sweet comes the sour when a murder mystery touches a little too close to Carley for comfort. Will she be able to stay one step ahead of a killer and still stay alive?<br /><br />Without going into a deeper synopsis as this could give away storylines for the reader this book is filled with many twists and turns which will keep the reader fully engaged in the story. Although the reader is clued into who the murder is mid way through the story this in no way diminishes the suspense portion of the story. Carley is a very likable chacter and one readers should be able to identify with. This is not a preachy inspirational read and the use of faith here is done tastefully. The setting of this story was very nice. Having grown up in Northern California (Yuba City to be exact) Ms. Blackwell as done a very good job of her description of both San Francisco and so on. Readers will wish they could pull up a chair in Tallulah, Mississippi themselves.

Having a brain pan did not in any way, shape, or form detract from him being a hero.  In fact Simon was one of those hero's you just want to curl up next to, make all of his issues go away.  And the best part of all of this, he would probably be open to this.  Okay...so we've established that Simon is an 5 star hero.  Why the lower rating?  Amanda is less than a perfect match.  She has such a low opinion of herself (granted she was raked over the coals by her nasty ex-husband) but still refuses to think better of herself.  Self confidence is not a word in her vocabulary.  As a result this reader became less than patient with her.<br /><br />This story revolves around a business merger that Amanda is trying to put together.  Everything is a go until Simon Brandt catches wind of it and puts a stop to it right away.  This genius is not about to have the family business sold and putting many loyal employees out of business.  The fact that this is the first time he's ever shown an interest in the running of Brandt Computers is not even an issue.  Or is it.<br /><br />Amanda needs this merger to go through.  Her whole career is riding on her being able to pull this off.  But when Simon becomes a road block she is sure that she can turn his way of thinking around.  Well...things aren't as always easy as they seem and getting Simon to listen to her purposal is more of an issue then coming up with it to begin with. Oh and we can't forget that on top of all of this is the burning attraction that Amanda feels for Simon and the fear that it's only one sided.  Does Amanda have a chance at all to see her dreams come true?<br /><br />This story had such potential but I was sad to see that there were so many slow parts that truly took away from the story. I found my attention wandering while I read it. I was also quickly fed up with the less than positive way of thinking that Amanda had.  After awhile I found my self thinking...\\"alright already...move on.\\"  Simon on the other hand is so clueless and socially inept that he was sweet and endearing. Ms. Monroe has great potential as a romance author and she is one that I will look forward to reading again in the future.  This story was good, not earth shaking...making room on my \\"keeper\\" shelf but a generic good.

Ms. Ashley's latest pirate romance was very good but not great.  Why not great?  Simple, I was unable to come to terms with the herorine.  Honoria ran both hot and cold with no middle ground.  This left me the reader feeling that this romance was a bit uneven.  Christopher on the other hand jumped up off the page.  He was by turns romantic, devil may care, and caring.  In my opinon he was almost too good for our lack luster heroine.<br /><br />Christopher and Honoria have a past.  She believed that Christopher had been hung as a result of him being a pirate.  Her heart though keeps thinking she sees him in the most unlikely of places.  The first man to have ever kissed her and awakened her heart could not still be alive...or could he?  She gets her answer and the answer is Christopher is alive and well and wanting to pick up where they left off.  As man and wife!  There's a problem there though.  Honoria is promised to another and she is fighting the feelings that Christopher evokes.  Will she follow her heart or will she ignore the one person she has always wanted.<br /><br />Christopher can't believe how much he still cares for the stubborn Honoria.  She is his wife and after four years he is ready to pick up where they left off.  Why is she fighting this so much they are meant to be together...granted there is the small problem of him and James Ardmore having unfinished business but that is just a small problem right?  Can they find a middle ground and happiness at the end of their road?<br /><br />Again this was a fun read.  We get to visit again with old friends from previous books and I'm always game for a hidden pirate treasure read.  This book was kept from being great by our heroine.  She clearly felt something for him...she married him, yet she felt the need to act like a spoiled twit when confronted by the one person she had never forgotten.  This reader just didn't get it.  This was annoying and quite frankly I felt that Christopher was maybe too good for her.  Still he acted the proper hero and stayed true to his love.  For that alone I give this read the higher rating.  This was a fun read and one that I would not over look.

Ms. Boyle's latest was a fun story but if the reader has not read the previous book \\"It Takes A Hero\\" they may come away slightly confused.  Is this a reason to overlook this read?  Good heaven's NO!  This was a fun read with a very different storyline that works.  Really.<br /><br />Alexander Denford is Baron of Sedgwick and his family...alright really his grandmere has been after him to marry.  Well, he comes by his lack or rather desire to marry naturally.  All the former Baron's have put off that nasty task until the very last minute.  One night when at his wits end and a few brandies to boot he and his best friend come up with the brilliant idea to...create a wife.  Enter Emmaline.  Emmaline is perfect.  She is not into society, lets her husband live life as he will and keeps her spending down.  She also faithfully writes Grandmere.  Did I mention she is a figment of Alex's imagination?  Or at least she was until he receives bills and the tabloids become alive with the doings of Lady S.  What's a man to do when his fake bride becomes all too real?  Go to London and confront the lady of course.  Alex has no idea what he's in for but the reality of Emmaline is NOT it!  She is everything opposite of what he dreamed her up to be.  She is sassy, strong, and capable.  She's also a mystery.  Now faced with a real wife he must make things right.  Can there be a happy ending for these two people?<br /><br />Emmaline and Alex are fun protaganist.  This story may not be the usual boy meets girl story but Ms. Boyle has made it entertaining. Perhaps because this is a fun storyline to draw the reader in. When you combine the extended family, the fictional family, and servants that want to matchmake you know your in for a real treat.  Ms. Boyle is a fun and talented author and one that I highly recommend.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-03-05

Why do you ask?  The answer is two fold really.  One the killer is female and her method is to kill at the moment her \\"guest\\" reaches climax.  Second she uses the victims to make her unusual furniture.  The bed she kills on is made totally of human bone and one can't forget the stool that is \\"Marty.\\"<br /><br />Sirena is a stripper and has had a rather hard life.  Still she has friends such as Chrissie the girlfriend of the strip club owner, and Ross the bartender.  Still her life is not a happy one and her killing is about to catch up with her.  Her last victim causes police and a P.I. to look into his disappearance.  The cop wants her and the P.I. is sure she killed the victim.  , The end though is nothing like you think it will be. What will happen to everyone that has anything to do with \\"Silky's Femme\\" the strip club?<br /><br />This is truly an edge of your seat read.  Ms. Mitchell manages to tie all loose ends together in a way that the reader will not feel cheated.  Sirena is truly an evil character but she vividly comes to life on the pages. The reader will alternate between horror and interest on what makes this character tick!  I highly recommend Ms. Mitchell read.  It will offer readers something new and fresh in a genre that at times seems saturated with mediocre attempts at suspense.	2005-03-05

I've bought everyone of her books and I've faithfully read them all as well.  Her last book \\"Daisy\\" was sad and a HUGE letdown.  \\"Trouble\\" though is a HUGE step back in the right direction.  Not only do we get to re-visit Gospel but the characters both primary and secondary add color and life to a storyline that is far from new and fresh.<br /><br />Rob Sutter was a DOG in the past.  He was into women way too much.  To the point of being a cheat but than he picks the wrong lady and all holy hannah breaks loose when she turns pyscho, stalker and shoots him not once but three times, effectivly ending his hockey career. Knowing that life as he knew it was over Rob heads to his mom to recover and put his life back together.  He is successful in doing this in Gospel Idaho.  He is on a ski vacation when he runs into Kate.<br /><br />Now Kate has her own issues.  She used to be a P.I. but her last case was the straw that broke the camels back so to speak.  She needs to take a break and decides to leave Las Vegas and head to Gospel, Idaho to visit with her grandfather.  Maybe, just maybe she will get some clarity.  Of course first she has to get there and a stop at a hotel along the way leads to one embaressed incident that just so happens to take place on Valentine's Day and with Rob Sutter of all people.  Thinking that she will never set eyes on the jerk again she makes her way to Gosepl and is trying to fit in when one day her grandfather calls her out of the backroom of the grocery store he owns to introduce her to...yup her worst nightmare.  Yummy Rob Sutter.  Now what's a girl to do?  Well, Gospel is small and they are bound to run into each other a lot.  So they really have no choice except to let nature take it's course....<br /><br />Rob and Kate were alternatly obnoxious and fun protagonists.  Rob is a jerk.  There is no two ways about this.  What makes him a \\"hero\\" is the fact that he learns from his mistakes and if anything is too careful.  Kate on the other hand is strong but at the same time lacks self confidence.  They both bring out the good in the other and this is why their romance is believable and entertaining.  The secondary storyline of Grace and Stanley is just that...a second story that's just an \\"extra\\" treat for readers.  The towns people are not as prevelent as they were in the past, but they are still fun and add just the right amount of fun without being over the top.  Although this is not one of my favorites by this author, she has redeemed herself with me.

The last offering from this author left me cold and let down.  I'm happy to say that Ms. Martin has restored my faith in her ability to tell a story that will draw in the reader.  Gemma and Sean are compelling character's and Ms. Martin has given them each their own rather large crosses to bear and they do so with class but at the same time not perfectly.  As a result the reader will both laugh, cry, and ache for these two people that are wanting to find love and acceptance and not sure they are right for one another.  After all opposites do attract but not always...<br /><br />Sean is a firefighter, Gemma is a practicing Wicca, new-age store owner. Oh, and she comes from a loud, in your face Italian family that at turns love and wear on her.  Still she finds the time to smile and think positive.  When she comes in contact with her firefighting neighbor (Sean) their reaction is well...combustible.  Still they can't ignore the fact that they are both so very different.  Will they be able to work out the problems and find love that they both want and need?<br /><br />Ms. Martin addes many twists and turns that keep our would be lovers apart.  Family, work, friends, tragedies...all play a part in this very good story that help the reader to learn about the \\"characters\\" of Gemma and Sean.  Old friends play vital roles in this story and were fun to visit with again.  Ms Martin had be laughing, crying, and even sighing with the romance of it all.

There were truly no flaws to be found with the pages.<br /><br />Daniel is a cop and a good one but when he looses another child to violence it's one child too many.  With bloodstained uniform still on he heads home only to find out that his long time girlfriend is read to move on with another man and that the place he thought was home really isn't.  He packs his car and leaves with no real destination in mind but he is looking for something, anything to prove that his life is not a waste.  Than out of no where he sees something in the road and swerves to avoid it.  The next thing he knows he wakes up, his car is totaled and he is in the middle of nowhere.  Realizing he can't lay there forever he gets up and walks for what seems forever before finally reaching a quaint little town.  Here he is graciously accepted and warmly welcomed.  In no time at all he meets Rosalie.  Rosalie awakens Daniel to the wonderful things in life.  He knows it's too soon but their relationship has quickly turned to love.  Just when he has found the one thing that makes his life worthwhile he finds out a terrible truth.  Will he be able to live with what he learns?<br /><br />Dr. Michael Hudson has gotten a chance of a lifetime to prove one of his theories \\"The Slim Veil\\" and with the help of his colleges he sets out to do just that.  He doesn't expect the results that he ends up getting.  Within days of arriving at a beat up old house he has an encounter with a spirit.  Soon there is a connection between Michael and the spirit and questions are asked and the answers are surprising.  What starts off as a quest to prove a theory becomes much more personal, forcing Michael to reevaluate his life and his choices.  Will Michael learn something vital from the other side in order to salvage the mess his life has become before it's too late?<br /><br />Daniel and Michael are compelling characters.  I was completely drawn into their world and felt their various pains, heart aches and doubts.  The fact that the author was able to create such vivid characters aptly demonstrates the talent behind the name.  Secondary characters Rosalie, Pete, Sarah, and Fran are also very important to the storyline.  This was a very emotional read that explored the paranormal world and the possibility of \\"what if?\\" in a very compelling way.

This was the first time I've ever read Ms. Bradley and her creative imagination has come up with a rather fun set of protaganist that are wonderful together and makes a good beginning to her new series \\"The Royal Four.\\"<br /><br />Willa Trent does not have the best luck when it comes to suitors.  They always seem to end up being carted away hurt, maimed, and scared.  Her luck or rather lack of luck brings down Nathaniel Stonewall the Earl of Reardon and aka \\"Lord Treason.\\"  He has embraced his fall from grace because he knows in his heart he is one of the most patriotic and loyal men of the crown. He is actually after the true traitor but gets waylaid by Willa and her slingshot!  Now not only does he have a bump on his head, he has a wife...yep a wife.  Problem is he can't bring another person down to his level, and he can't tell her the truth either.  Does this relationship have even half a chance of lasting?<br /><br />These two characters were wonderful with each other!  There was humor and tenderness between them which made reading about them falling in love all the more entertaining.

I think one of the reasons why I like this series so much...aside from the yummy alpha male hero's is due to the fact that each small episode is a stand alone read so if you've missed any you aren't left scratching your head in wonder.  These stories are short, steamy, and with great protagonists that compliment each other very well.<br /><br />Eli is in in a tight situation.  He has just returned to undercover duty after being poisoned.  He has lost a lot of ground and he must now free 12 women and one thorn in his side lady before they are all sold into slavery.  Taking his one shot at making sure this happens he indirectly involves the \\"thorn in his side\\" or Stella to create a diversion in order to make contact with the Smithson Group in order to make arrangements to get the heck out of dodge.  Well, the diversion works...maybe a little to well and the hostage becomes the prison taker when Eli feels a little more for Stella than irritation.  Can he get Stella and himself out of harms way or will Spectra IT win?<br /><br />This was a very short story.  It totals only 115 pages.  As a result readers are in for a very fast-paced read since there is a lot included within the previously mentioned pages.  Ms. Kent has made the most of what she offers so readers should not be let down in the slightest.

This was a very chilling read by one of today's hottest suspense authors.  She has not only penned a fine read that will grab the reader from the get go, she also manages to lay the ground work for the sequel as well.<br /><br />This story takes place in rural Oregon where ex-Hollywood actress Jenna Hughes is trying to live a normal life with her two teenage daughters.  Both girls are upset about being uprooted from friends and their father to live in the wilds of Oregon.  Jenna is doing her best but life seems to be working against her.  Feeling that something bad is about to happen Jenna starts receiving frightening notes at her home, and props that she has donated to the local theater have turned up missing.  She thinks that this is just another case of a fan being a little to obsessed with her.  She thinks she can handle it.  She thinks wrong.<br /><br />At the same time, temperatures are dropping and bodies are turning up dead on the mountain.  They are being found with a strange substance on them, and when Sheriff Shane Carter starts really investigating it he is unaware in the beginning that his murders are connected to Jenna's mail.  Soon he finds the connection but will he be able to catch the killer before he kills Jenna or her daughters?  And more importantly is this someone that he has always known?<br /><br />This was a strong and chilling suspense read.  There are plenty of possible suspects and plenty of red herring thrown out to keep the reader on the edge of their seat until the killer is unveiled.  This killer is without a doubt one of the scarcest characters I've read in awhile.  The romance storyline is very mild so readers of the romance genre may be a little disappointed.  Still Shane and Jenna were compelling characters and their attraction and interaction was an important part of this story.  Groundwork has been laid for her next novel in this two part series.

This was the first time I've ever read Ms. LaFoy and she created a very nice story that was well paced and entertaining.  Isabella was a very likable character as was our hero Barrett.  There romance was very sensual and at the same time very sweet.<br /><br />Isabella takes a huge chance when she goes to the office of Barrett after he is acused of killing her cousing Mignon.  Each cousin was given half of a map believed to be a treasure map from the pirate Jean Lafitte.  Mignon believing that the first clue to the treasures location is in London sets off for England.

Now against time and a killer they race to find out the truth regarding the treasure...and along the way find love with each other.  But will they live happily ever after?<br /><br />This was again a good book.  Isabella and Barrett are strong characters that manage to take control of the story and there by drawing in the reader.

This title originally came out as \\"Ivan Takes a Wife\\" back in 1989.  This was a fast read that demonstrated that Ms. Evanovich was well on her way to becoming the author she is today.<br /><br />Without going into great detail this is a short but sweet romance featuring the great, great, great...grandson of a pirate and one burned out ex-narcotic cop turned cook for a schooner.  Well, the schooner belongs to the pirate grandson and well...these two have a rather unique introduction that involves a tumble down a hill and a few laughs.  Needless to say Ivan and Stephanie are a great pair and when you combined them with a haunted house, a stolen blueberry pie, a ghost on a ship, and one rather mobile dead body you have the ingrediants for one fun Evanovich read.<br /><br />Readers should keep in mind that this is a re-print with a few changes from the original story.  This is also not as great as some of her newer efforts.  This is still a worthy effort to re-visit or visit for the first time to see how much Ms. Evanovich has grown as an author.

Ms. Michaels has created a wonderful little world filled with great characters that experience a whole range of emotions.

She falls in love with her co-star Noah Patrick and after one night in his arms her heart is broken the next morning when she realizes that their night together is not remembered by Noah because he had been drunk.  One night is all it takes to send Lindsay packing and heading back home to Missouri.  Now years later she is running a book store with her cousin, she's a widow and raising a teenage son, and trying to get over the hurt of her stage mother, mother, and jealously of her sister Jolie.  When she promises to do a play her sister wrote she has no idea that Noah is on his way to Missouri to play the male lead.  What will she do when she is faced once again with her biggest mistake, and only love?<br /><br />Noah has ruined everything in his life with one swig from a bottle.  A recovering alcoholic he is learning the hard way that nothing comes easy or cheap.  Hollywood is no longer looking his way and his options are truly running out.  That is until his one and only nightmare Viviane shows up and offers him a deal he can't turn down.  Star in her daughters play for six weeks and get his feet under him again and maybe, just maybe Hollywood would give him another look.  He has no idea that his acceptance is going to change his life in ways he never thought possible.<br /><br />Noah and Lindsay are wonderfully complex characters.  They have both been hurt and have the internal scars to prove it.  Lindsay and Noah's relationship is intense and built up slowly.  As a result the reader will feel fully invested in how things proceed.  It will also seem more real.  Secondary characters such as Vivien, Jolie and the rest of the family are wonder additions to this engaging read.

But when she thinks her fiance Scott is cheating on her she hires P.I. Jack Wade to find out just what Scott is up to.  What she doesn't count on or expect is the sizzling attraction that Jack and she instantly feel.  Can this attraction turn into something more?<br /><br />Jack doesn't do the \\"cheating partner\\" cases anymore but there is just something about Liz that he can't say no to.  Maybe it's her sweet yet spicy looks and nature.  Or maybe, just maybe he sees something that he didn't realize he was looking for.  When he accepts the case and provides proof that Scott is less than honest Liz doesn't accept photographic evidence.  Jack offers to take her with him when he follows Scott one more night.  Soon Liz is forced to accept that her fiance is a creep, and that Jack awakens her senses in ways she never imagined. Will Jack allow himself though to feel more than just physical pleasure with Liz or will he finally open his heart to love?<br /><br />This was a very sensual read.  Jack and Liz very interesting characters and Scott makes a good but weak villian.  This was a very fast read that truly brought to life the outlandish and sensual side of New Orleans.  If you like your heros hot and the love scenes hotter than look no further than Lacy Alexander.  She is an author worth picking up.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-02-18

Ms. Simpson's \\"The Dark Lord\\" has a little of something for everyone.  This romance is a little bit like the old \\"gothic\\" romances of old.  There's suspense, a large helping of the paranormal and even a little humor thrown in to keep this a page turning read.<br /><br />Fay Rae is on vacation in Egypt when she finds a mysterious box.  Told by a local person to get rid of it as soon and as fast as should could (perferably in a body of water) Fay considers the warning.  Her sister Angie on the other hand laughs in the face of danger and superstition and opens the Forbidden Tarot deck.  Nothing seems to happen but things are not always what they seem.  Rae returns home to find out that her mentor and friend has died and left half of his house to her along with a mysterious message.  She has also made the acquaintance of a strange man named Simeon.  This man seems to have a strange hold on Angie and Rae each, and Michael doesn't trust him any further than he could throw him.  What does this man have to do with the strange goings on and what kind of danger is Rae really in?<br /><br />This was a very fast-paced read.  Michael and Rae have a very complicated relationship based on their past.  This was a very sweet romance between these two very scared people.

The end result is a fast paced read that will offer the reader a \\"cliff-hanging\\" ending. I look forward to seeing what Ms. Perry comes up with next.<br /><br />Jessica Ramsey is living a life of desperation. Jessica was an abused wife. Realizing that she needed to escape her husband Cole she took a very daring step...she faked her death. Although this should have left her free to live a normal life she is still desperate. Desperate to stay dead, desperate to provide for her little boy, and if she's honest with herself she is desperate to believe in happy endings. All of this is about to be put to the test. A chance meeting brings Jessica back to her past. She sees Cole in a diner and all of her fears are brought to the forefront. What she doesn't know is that Cole has a twin brother and the man she sees in the diner is Alex. The one man she got to know over the phone but never met, the one man that will change her life in ways she never expects.<br /><br />Alex is estranged from his twin. An incident back during their childhood has caused a riff that Alex has never been able to cross. When he runs into Jessica by accident he has no idea that she is his brother's wife. He is shocked by what he sees once he realizes how scared Jessica is and by what length's she went to escape his brother. Now he is involved in keeping her and her son Joe safe. He didn't realize what he was doing when he contacted his brother to tell him that he had found Jessica alive and well. By doing so he has set into motion a series of events that even he couldn't imagine. Will he be able to keep Jessica safe and at the same time prove to her that although he and his brother may share the same face they don't share anything else in common and that he loves her and will be loyal to her?<br /><br />This was a great story that brought into question so many different things. What would you do if your twin was evil? Could you love a person that shared the same face as your nightmare?

All in all this was a good debut and I look forward to reading Ms. Gabriel in the future.<br /><br />Conner MacPherson has made a promise and when Conner makes a promise...he keeps it.  He is a displaced Viscount's son.  He is now considered an outlaw and with no place to call home he must see through his promise.  He must steal a bride, marry her, and keep her safe from a bad alliance.  Everything goes according to plan until he finds out he has wedded and bedded the wrong sister!  Now what should he do?  Honor the marriage that his heart has become in engaged in or annul the marriage and steal the right sister.<br /><br />Sophie is on her way to her betrothed when she finds herself taken by a dark highlander.  She at first is unaware that she is in fact the target of an bride stealing.  She is by turns upset and accepting of her situation.  Connor makes her heart pound and her legs turn weak and this is just from his kisses.  But Sophie thought she had been in love once before and the end result has turned her almost against the tender affection.  Can she trust or more importantly risk her heart one more time with Connor?  Or will circumstances change the future once again.<br /><br />Connor and Sophie are compelling characters.  I loved the background history of Sophie's stay in Brugge, Belgium.  Their love story was sweet and tender and at the same time lacked...something.  I would have liked to have seen these two characters fleshed out just a little bit more.  Each had their own secret that they held on to just a little to long.  Overall as a vehicle for keeping our lovers apart it was rather weak.  Still the story was compelling enough to keep me engaged.  There were a few slow spots I confess to skimming but they were few and far between.

There is a parchment with a forged signature of her brothers in the hands of the barbarian High Sheriff of Warringham, Fane Linford's Keep.  If the Sheriff sees this parchment her brother Rudd will be called a traitor and he is the only family she has left in the world.  He protected her once before, and she owes it to him to do the same. She knows in her heart that he is not a traitor to the Crown.  Under the guise of a dancer from the East, Rexana plans to me a diversion so a loyal member of their household may slip in and retrieve the damning evidence.  Instead her act draws the eye of Fane, and he is captivated by the little dancer.  Soon Rexana is dancing a very different dance with steps that must be taken carefully or all will be lost.<br /><br />Fane has lived a harsh life.

Ms. Kean is true to her characters by making Rexana strong, and stubborn but at the same time endearing.  Fane is a hero in every sense of the word.

This is very good book and I would have given it a higher rating but at times Ms. Solomon bogged down the read with so much detail.

It seems that Western Romance is back on the upswing and this turn around is due to several new books that have come out in recent months.  Teresa Bodwell's debut effort is a read that I would recommend if you enjoy western romance and engaging characters.<br /><br />Without going into great detail this is a story of one woman who has choosen to lead a life that...well, lets just say she runs a cattle ranch and wears trousers and is tall and rather curvy.  In other words she is not a dainty little thing waiting to be rescued.  She is on a trip to Abiline to sell her cattle when she has a run in with Thad Buchanan.  Thad needs someone to lead him into Colorado so he can see his sister.  He is desperate to get there but not fool-hardy enough to make the trek not knowing the way.  He has no idea that he has just taken a step in the direction of his future.  But first he must make sure that the sassy, and sexy Mercy has her say...<br /><br />Mercy and Thad were fun characters.

Ms. Howell and Ms. Sands have worked together to bring to life a very different \\"vampire\\" legend that was very entertaining.<br /><br />Two men need to find wives that are of normal blood (in other words...not vampire)in order to extend the family lines.  I know this makes no sense but trust me...you just have to read the stories.  Anyhow without going into great detail and thereby risking the chance of ruining the story for everyone suffice it to say this was a fun read with the trademark humor both authors manage to offer readers.  Why than not a higher rating you ask?  The answer is simple.  There was really no continuity between these two stories.  It was about a set of cousins, and where one aspect of the legend was important, in the other story is was darn right ignored.  This would not have been a problem if the reader was clued into why certain issues (such as the mating ritual) did not apply.  This reader was left scratching her head a few times since there was no explanation.<br /><br />On the whole I felt Ms. Howell's story was a little bit stronger than Ms. Sands.  This is not to say Ms. Sand's story was not good, it was but her character's simply did not speak to me as much as Ms. Howell's.  If you like a good vampire romance this is the book for you.

Holly Lisle is an author that after only one read I've added to my \\"must read\\" list of romantic suspense authors.  \\"Midnight Rain\\" is a compelling read that is both chilling and riveting. I was totally absorbed into the fast paced read from the very beginning.<br /><br />Phoebe Rain's life has never been simple, easy, and safe.  She lives in hiding fearing that her abusive husband will finally finish what he started years earlier. Working as a tarot card reader for a phone network and living without friends or family is starting to take it's toll.  Just when she thinks that maybe...just maybe she can start opening up she starts getting phone calls from her husband that should be in a coma.  She knows that it's him and she knows it's only a matter of time before he makes good his promise to see her dead.  If this was not enough on her already full plate she has developed a friendship of sorts with her next door neighbor.  She finds herself drawn to Alan and hopes that she manages to live long enough to see what being truly loved and cherished feels like.  Problem is she has been told that her husband has died and the person she's being stalked by could in no way be Michael.  Does this mean she's being haunted and stalked by a ghost or is her nightmare truly a flesh and blood person?<br /><br />This book offers the ultimate nightmare situation.  This book was chilling and the evil element in this story is truly amazing.  Phoebe and Alan are dynamic characters' that come with their own individual problems but at the same time are open and willing to trust.  Their relationship is slowly built over the course of this read and therefore believable for the reader.  It has been a very long time since I've read a book that made me want to keep the lights on after I put the book down.  For spine chilling read I highly recommend \\"Midnight Rain\\" as your reading choice.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-02-06

Shannon Drake was one of the original authors that I read when I began to explore the sub-genre of vampire fiction.  I came to this genre with the belief that a storyline based on a vampire could ever be as good or as engrossing as something Ann Rice could create.  As a result I was a \\"snob\\" when it came to picking authors I'd even bother with.  The first three stories in Ms. Drake's vampire series were amazing.  I loved the characters, the storyline, and even the way she worked the legend of the vampire.  The past three efforts though have left a lot to be desired and sadly this newest effort is no different.<br /><br />What is wrong with this read you ask?  Although this story had a lot of potential and some old friends from past books make an appearance this was not enough to save the story in my opinion.  Stephanie and Grant had the potential of being great romantic leads.  This story opens with them already having had a past relationship that ended...somewhat poorly.  They both still care about each other but things started to change and Grant was slowly becoming someone that Stephanie began to almost...fear.  Now they both wind up in a remote Italian village under different circumstances but the end result is the same.  They are together again and when people start to turn up ravaged and brutally murdered they find themselves working together to come to an understanding and hopefully stop whatever or whoever is set on murdering people.<br /><br />Ms. Drake is without a doubt a very talented author and one that I normally enjoy reading.  The problem with this read was she used the concept of \\"dreams\\" and \\"visions\\" to express too many important parts of the story.  By doing this the reader could be left confused and frustrated. This reader was in any event. The storyline was not as strong as it could have been and although the characters were varied and many, few stayed with this reader after the final page was finished.  If you are in the market for a strong vampire romance I highly suggest that you pick up one of her first efforts as they are worthy of five star ratings.  This read was okay, not earth shaking, or one that I would recommend if you are either a) new to Ms. Drake, or b)looking for a new vampire legend.  Truly I picked this book up out of loyalty to this author and because I have read all of the previous titles in her vampire series.  Perhaps I'll be more discriminating next time around.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]g vampire romance I highly suggest that you pick up one of her first efforts as they are worthy of five star ratings.

First off let me say that I've been reading this series in order from the very first book and each story gets better and better.  Why do you ask?  Simple this is a complex world that Ms. Kenyon has created and as a result each book is a small \\"episode\\" in the big picture.  We learn a little more about the characters (both new and past characters), learn a little more about the legend, and of course there is always the romance!!!  *SIGH*<br /><br />In this story we are treated to Valerius Magnus.  We have been introduced to him in several of Ms. Kenyon's other DH stories...a more unlikable charcter I never thought to read about (okay I thought the same about Zarek and was wrong) so because I'm a loyal fan I picked up her latest.  Silly me...I had nothing to worry about.  We truly get to know Valerius and what makes him tick.  His story (without getting into details that would spoil it for other readers) is fast paced and...well, great.  Tabitha is a very strong character (again we met her in earlier DH stories and she is the twin of Amanda) but at the same time amazingly sweet and understanding.  Just the kind of person Valerius needs in his cynical life.  Of course the path to true love is never smooth and this is the case for these two lovers.<br /><br />I highly look forward to the next in the series and know that it will be as good if perhaps not better than the previous titles.  A warning to new readers...this really is a series that builds on it's self.  In order to understand all of the little twist and turns it's helpful to have read all of the previous titles.  Still this is not a book you want to avoid if have not already read the first six books.  This story is still a good stand alone read.  If anything it will have readers looking for Ms. Kenyon's backlist.<br /><br />For a fun and entertaining paranormal/vampire read I highly recommend Ms. Kenyon and her Dark-Hunter series!<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-02-01

I admit to being a HUGE Andrea Kane fan from way back.  I fell in love with her historical romances (Samantha was the first I'd ever read) and admit to being somewhat apprehensive when I found out that she was changing genres.  How could she do that to me I asked?  Well, I truly had nothing to fear as her romantic suspense efforts have proven to be getting better and better and this book is no exception.<br /><br />Without going into a detailed synopsis (this could give away some key aspects of the suspense and than possibly ruining the read for some) suffice it to say that Ms. Kane took extreme care in setting up and executing her storyline.  Characters a key and important part of any story are wonderfully dynamic.  Taylor and Reed the romantic leads in this page turning story are wonderful complements to each other.  Not only were they likable characters, I truly cared about how their romance was going to develop and in which direction it would go.<br /><br />Although readers may divine who the killer is early on in the story this in no way hurts this read.  I must admit to guessing right up to the unveiling.  I'm sure fellow readers will be totally caught up in Ms. Kane's latest effort.  This is one author that I highly recommend and suggest that you not only check out this read, but her backlist as well.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-02-01

This is the final story in the \\"Shadows\\" trilogy and we are finally treated to Noah Bishop's story.  For fan's of Ms. Hooper this is one of her better stories that includes not only an evil serial killer but enough sparks and tension between the two main characters that readers will be caught up in the story right up to the final gripping chapter.<br /><br />Miranda Knight is a sheriff in a small southern town which now finds itself in the middle of a nightmare.  Someone is killing young teenagers and leaving nothing behind except carnage.  Knowing that she has no choice Miranda contacts the special FBI unit that Bishop is in charge of.  The fact that years earlier Miranda and Bishop were involved but Bishop betrayed her trust has everthing to do with her reluctance of inviting him back into her life.  But she knows that her future is set and that he must come back in order to save her sister Bonnie.  Will she be able to protect herself and her heart at the same time open herself up to find a killer?<br /><br />Bishop will do anything he can to get through to Miranda.  He knows that he hurt her and he wants to explain what went wrong but first he must work at profiling a killer that is stalking and hunting in Miranda's town.  The killer is clever but he will be more so...he must be before the killer kills Miranda.<br /><br />This was a gripping page-turning read.  Bishop and Miranda are compelling characters as is the secondary storyline that revolves around their past.  Readers might divine the killer mid-way through the story but this in no way detracts from the story.  Ms. Hooper has created a true evil villian but equally true heros!  This is a story that I highly recommend!<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-01-28

Ms. Hingle has delivered yet again another romantic suspense that will keep the reader enthralled until the final page.<br /><br />Tess Abbott is a sucessful TV investigative reporter and just weeks after the suicide death of her father she gets a call that changes her life and sends her on a journey into her past and she might just find out what happened the night her mother was murdered.  With the help of a few of the locals of Grady, Mississippi namely reporter Spencer Reed, she starts an investigation that will create more questions than answers with all of the players being big political movers and shakers.  Will she be able to accept in the end who killed her mother and took her life away from her?  But more importantly will she allow herself to let Spencer into her heart?<br /><br />This was a very fast paced read with plenty of twists and turns on Tess' path to truth.  The secondary characters play a very important part in the primary storyline and the relationship between Andy and Maggie only added to the stoy.  Ms. Hingle delivers everytime and as a result I have no problem recommending this read, or any of her other efforts in print.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-01-28

This is Ms. Carr's first book where she is the only author offering fun stories with great characters.  She is well on her way to being an author I'll pick on name alone.<br /><br />This was a book that is composed of three short stories that are connected by the female leads.  All three were once sorority sisters and their lives are...well, lets just say there's room for improvement if it come in the form of a special someone.<br /><br />\\"Six Weeks to Sensuality\\" is the story of Amy Bryce and her decision to get her life back brought on by a very public engagement of her ex-boyfriend.  Said boyfriend has turned her well ordered world on it's axis and has brought about the decision that Amy needs to get in touch with her inner vixen.  She goes to Dr. Marc Javier.  This dishy doc has had a thing for Amy and he can't believe his luck when she come to his office hoping to participate in his latest test.  But why now?  Will he be able to get her heart at the same time waking her sensuality or will he loose her to a jerk that doesn't deserve her?<br /><br />In \\"Code Pink\\" Jennifer Clark has decided that she is done doing a boring job and wants to move on as a code breaker.  What's holding her back though is fellow code breaker and heart breaker Bryan Matthews.  What happens when this hunk gets a hold of code meant for someone else and these two end up in a battle of the wills not to mention talent?  Why a hot steamy affair of course but will it last?<br /><br />\\"Fantasies Are Forever\\" brings together two co-workers...well, at least in dreams to begin with.  Caroline Mitchell can't believe that she is dreaming about Joe...so what's the best way to get rid of an unwanted dream...make it a reality.  Or so Caroline thinks.  But when these two get together fantasy and dreams don't even come close to the heat that they generate.<br /><br />All three of these stories were good.  \\"Code Pink\\" was probably my favorite since the characters were so life like.  All three were good...don't get me wrong but that one story seemed stronger than the others.  Still this was a fun and easy read that entertained me while I was reading it.  I recommend this read and look forward to reading Ms. Carr again in the future.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]re good...don't get me wrong but that one story seemed stronger than the others.

I pick up any book that has Ms. Davidson's name on the cover. Her stories are always fresh and new and her unique voice is one that stands out among the romance genre.<br /><br />Ms. Davidson has done it again and wrote a story outside the lines (in this case think modern bionic woman) including her tradmark wit and humor. This was a fast-paced read but I do have a complaint in the fact that I felt it might have been a bit too short. Otherwise this was a great read that I managed to put away in one sitting.<br /><br />Caitlyn James has died and gone to Minnesota??? Yup, that's right she has died and been \\"fixed\\" in a secret lab in Minnesota. She has been fixed with nanobytes and can now jump building in a single leap, throw the bad guys across the room, and scan things. What she can't do is turn her back on the technology that she's toting around. The Boss (yes, that's his name...) won't let her. Caitlyn won't take no for an answer and goes back to her old life as hairstylist and colorist. But no matter how hard she tries life just isn't the same. Shoot, she can't even get drunk anymore! Than at one party Tall Dark and Yummy (aka Yummypants) walks in and out of her life in a blink. Before she knows it she is working one more case for The Boss that pairs these two people up. A killer is on the loose and its killing the team that put Yummypants and Caitlyn together with their computer parts. (all part of the story...trust me) Her job is to catch the baddie and than...well, who knows at this point. What she doesn't count on is falling for Dmitri (aka Yummypants...see he did have a name) and him finding her...well, to use a tired word...yummy. Will they be able to find the killer before he kills the last memeber of the team?<br /><br />Again this was a fun read. Caitlyn and Dmitri were a good pairing but they weren't together that much. I would have like to have seen their relationship develope a little more than it did. Ms. Davidson's trademark wit and humor is in abundance as is the sensuality she is known for. Overall this was a good read but could have been great if it had a few more pages worth of development. In the end this is a read that I would not suggest you miss.

Although the storyline is not new (girl falls for boy, boy falls for sister but realizes that the other sister is the \\"one\\") the way Ms. Michaels created her characters made this a \\"one of a kind\\" read that will stay with the reader long after the final page. This was the first time I've ever read Ms. Michaels and needless to say I'll be ordering her back list soon.<br /><br />This story kind of reminded me of the re-make of \\"Sabrina\\" with Harrison Ford with a twist. Dory can't remember a time that she did not love Chase McKay the chaufferu's son. He breaks her heart though when he is found in a compromising situation with Dory's perfect and beautiful older sister Jilly. Sent away to college Chase leaves and doesn't look back. That is until his father's health causes him to do more than look back, he comes back to Outlook. He thinks he's got his act together since he is an exteremly successful architect but truth is he thinks wrong...way wrong and before the dust settles he's going to find himself married to both Lambert sisters before he realizes that what he didn't think he wanted was the one thing he did.<br /><br />Dory's heart is broken when Chase leaves but it's not long before her life is turned upside down and the privilaged life she was leading comes to an end...sort of when the Lambert fortune is stolen from them by means of an illegal wire transfer. Now her parents have to hide in order to prevent her father from being arrested and Jilly, Aunt Ping, and Dory must find the louse that stole the money while keeping a hold of the family estate. Of course this is not an easy task, but Dory can handle it...can't she?<br /><br />This was a great story full of humor, and friendship between family as well as a romantic story. Chase is not the birghtest bulb in the shop when it comes to realizing what his heart already knows. This is truly a story with a wonderful cast of both primary and secondary charactes that each bring something special to the story. This is truly a modern day romance where the girl is not necessarily waiting for the prince to save her, but is willing to roll up her sleeves and do it herself if she must while at the same time being patient waiting for her prince to get a clue.<br /><br />Ms. Michaels is an author that I highly recommend if you like a smart fast-paced story with endearing characters.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]nd secondary charactes that each bring something special to the story.

Ms. Karr is off to a great start to her writing career with this debut effort.  Although her storyline is not \\"new\\" she has created characters that are not only colorful but memorial as well.  As a result fans of historical romance fiction now have a new author to add to their author list that shows great potential.<br /><br />Jo is playing a risky game.  She has shed the trapping of womanhood in order to keep a roof over her grandmother and sister's head as well as food in the pantry.  She takes a risky step and presents herself to Earl of Sinclair as J. Quincy. Looking to be placed in the position of secretary.  Sinclair takes a chance on the young and impertinent cub but is thrown for a loop when he finds out the J stands for Josephine and not Joseph.  He gives the sassy girl a chance to fix his books before he sends her packing.  It wouldn't do for society to find out that his secretary is a female and not male.  Problem is though...the longer he spends time in her company...the more he wants to spend time with her.  But Sinclair has his own wounds and his own duties and he can't turn his back on his title.  Plus Jo won't hurt his mother.  They will never be able to act on their attraction...or could they?<br /><br />This was a very romantic read.  The push and pull between Quincy and Sinclair will keep readers glued to the pages if only to see when these two people will finally be able to act on their feelings.  Although the storyline is not new Ms. Karr has kept it fresh by the direction she takes with both main characters as well as the additional antics of the secondary cast of characters.  I highly recommend this debut and suggest that the reading community keep an eye out for this fresh new talent.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-01-24

Ms. Hooper is an automatic buy for me when it comes to her romantic paranormal suspense reads.  As per usual I've come to this series in a roundabout way but lo and behold I seem to have picked this series up in order.<br /><br />Cassie Neill is a psychic that just wants peace and quite in her life.  After a case goes bad she runs as far and as fast as she can to North Carolina.  Here she finds a small little town and the peace that she seeks.  Or at least she did until a serial killer starts hunting in her backyard and killing neighbors.  This is all bad enough until the killer connects with Cassie.  Now she feels obiligated to help and goes to Ben Ryan hoping he will understand her talents and accept her help.<br /><br />Ben Ryan is drawn to Cassie.  He knows that she is the real deal and he doesn't want her tangling with the mind of a serial killer.  Unfortunatly what he wants and what he gets are two different things.  Now as more and more dead bodies turn up and the fear and anger of the town increases his self appointed job of keeping Cassie safe is getting harder and harder to achieve.  Than the unexpected happens will Ben be able to save the life of the first woman he's ever loved?<br /><br />This was a very fast-paced read and it goes without say that the storyline was unique and engrossing.  Ms. Hooper is a truly talented author and her characters are larger than life and very vivid.  As a result the reader will easily be transport to Ryans Bluff, North Carolina and the make believe world that Ms. Hooper has created.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-01-23

For effort alone I've given this book three stars otherwise this book was a rather large letdown.  This book is the second in her \\"Shadow series\\" and so far as been my least favorite.<br /><br />What's the problem you ask yourself?  Well, it's simple.  This story had too much.  Plenty of red herrings to stear the reader in wrong directions but at the same time this had a \\"de-railing\\" factor for this reader.  Perhaps it's because this is more of a consipracy theory type storyline instead of the serial killer storyline that I'm used to with this author she changed gears.  This is great from the creative few-point but...<br /><br />Characters were another problem with this read.  Faith was to put it bluntly an annoying character.  Perhaps this was due to her description from the author...fragile...helpless.  Eventually she does manage to put together an attitude but for this reader it was a little to late.  Kane was another annoying character.  So in love with Dinah but soon so in love with Faith.  Okay...sure.<br /><br />All in all by the time we get to the ending and the bad guy is unveiled it's not a huge surprise and to be honest I got to a point where I didn't care.  This story did have potential but I feel that Ms. Hooper was just off her game when she was penning this story.  Noah Bishop is included but not as often as I would have liked to have seen.  I look forward to the next and last in the series and suggest that yes, pick up this read but come with much lower expectations.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-01-23

You are guaranteed a hot steamy romance with great characters everytime you pick up one of her stories.  Her latest effort \\"Mouth to Mouth\\" not only offers a great story but this time her character's are not \\"perfect\\" and as a result the reader will probably identify with them more.<br /><br />Laurel Watkins is done playing it safe.  She wants to live life and so after making that decision she begins an internet relationship with a man who calls himself Russ.  She makes a date with him and waits in a coffee shop patiently waiting for her destiny to walk through the door.  Well, he does but he's not what she expected or was waiting for.  You see the real Russ is a police detective and he's working on a case involving fraud and his suspect is named Trevor.  He doesn't know what to make of Laurel.  She has turned his head and fast.  She is pretty, sweet and can you spell the word naive?  Once he realizes that she is Trevor's next victim he does what any good police officer would do.  Warn her off of any dangerous Internet interaction.  You just never know what you'll meet online.<br /><br />Laurel can't take a lecture from the yummy Russ and she is tired of playing it safe...so what does our bold new lass do...offers to have a flaming hot romance with Russ.  Well, that gets the good detectives attention and quick.  Now with the green flag will these two different people find more than just a good time?  And more importantly will Trevor turn out to be a bigger threat than they think he will be?<br /><br />Again, this was a very fast paced read that entertained this reader up until the final page.  Although Laurel is deaf this in no way detracts from the storyline or from the romance.  If anything it makes it better.  Secondary characters and their storylines are essential to this story as well as entertaining.

Ms. French started this saga off with \\"The Conqueror\\" and has continued the story with \\"Tha Barbarian.\\"  As before Ms. French has woven a very dramatic story around a time period and location that few authors ever want to touch on.  The end result is a love story that is compelling and sensual.<br /><br />Roxanne has found herself a member of the Pharoh's harem with no memory of who or what she is. She does not remember the love she felt for Alexander, or the child that she bore.  She doesn not remember her childhood love Kayan.  She easily accepts what she is told by the Pharoh and lives her life enjoying the friendship that has grown between her and the Pharoh.  That is until one night a Barbarian sweeps in and changes her life.  Daring her to remember what she has forgotten and embracing the truth once she realizes it.<br /><br />We were introduced to Kayan in the previous title and in this story he is center stage.  Ms. French has a very descriptive way of writing and as a result the reader will be transported back in time with the characters.  You will be able to see, smell, and feel all that our strong heroine Roxanne experiences.  This is a sensual romance that I truly enjoyed.

Her stories always managed to transport me back in time to the steamy, lazy, southern days.  I loved to read about New Orleans during her golden era and the men and women who lived and loved during that time.  I was thrilled to find out that Ms. Blake was back to penning her historical romances and that she was starting off a new series with the title \\"Challenge to Honor.\\"  As a result I pre-ordered it and anxiously awaited it's arrival. I was sad to find out though that within the cover of this book was basically a re-telling of some of her older stories.  Just names had changed not much else.<br /><br />Celina Vallier is a pawn in life.  Her father wants to marry her to a Spaniard that she finds repulsive but she is a good daughter and is willing to do as told.  This was not a problem until she met and made a deal with Rio de Silva for safety of her brother Denys.  She promises Rio her honor and the fact that they are instantly attracted each other.  Rio makes her feel alive and he listens to her. It's only a matter of time before she is in his arms.  What she doesn't know right away is that Rio wants revenge against her fiance.  This does not stop them from falling in love with each other.  But Rio is not suitable for her in social circles, and if he dares to make public his love for Celina he could loose all that he has worked for.  Will he choose love or will honor win out?<br /><br />Ms. Blake still manages to create vivid characters whom stand out from other characters that readers of historical and other genre's of romance incounter.  We are introduced to several of them as the groundwork for the upcoming series. Although I enjoyed this read I felt that it fell a little short due to the fact that there was really nothing \\"new.\\"  This is not to say that this is not a worth while read...it is but it I hope that the future books in this series tend to be a little more fresh and new.  Less formula would help.  In any event Ms. Blake has returned to her fans with a read that will transport us back to a magical time in New Orleans that no longer exists with characters the reader will care about.

Although Victoria acted like a twit a few times and Cord reciprocated and acted the fool these two still manage to be a very engaging couple and one that readers will root for a happy ending.  Claire, Miles, \\"Chez\\", and the rest of the secondary cast are wonderful additions to this story.  My only complaint?  We must wait until Aug. '05 for the next in the series!  I highly recommend Ms. Martin if you are a fan of historical romantic fiction.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]ial Reviewer for [...]	2005-01-14

She has taken the age old question of men vs. women and put her own spin on it. The end result is a laugh out loud read that will have the reader glued to the pages in order for them to see just how Matt and Annie end up!<br /><br />Annie does not have the greatest track record with men. She thinks that she currently has a winner with Dave, but a flower/video delivery later puts that theory to rest. What's a girl to do now??? She gets even and creates her very own dream guy. Okay, she comes up with this idea for work but hey, it could work. A video Joe that will treat a woman the way she wants to be treated. No being dumped by this virtual hunk!<br /><br />Matt, Annie's boss thinks that this is the dumbest thing he's ever heard of. It's never going to fly and what's worse...they might just be laughed at right out of a job! Matt could not have been more wrong, and now Annie and Matt are going to have to team market the video game. Since these two have a history...one night of scrap you off the ceiling sex...and...nothing. Matt is all about staying single and Annie is all about the house, white picket fence, dog, and kids. They couldn't be more different. Or are they really wanting the same thing???<br /><br />This was a great character driven read. Collin (co-worker and best friend to both Matt and Annie) is a riot and a wonderful addition to this colorful story. As is Annie's mom, Rico, Helena...well, you get the picture. Ms. Halliday has taken various social, and relationship issues and has created a wonderful story. I highly recommend Ms. Halliday's latest effort. Be prepared to laugh out loud and at time even agree with the characterization!<br /><br />Offical Reviewer for [...]	2005-01-12

I understand that she is a creative soul and wants to play around with various mediums when it comes to her writing.  This latest attempt at penning an amazing story fell way short of the mark.  I should have been paying more attention to the fact that this came out in paperback and not the hardback addition.<br /><br />This entire read is written in first person. I know that this is a popular trend for the sub-genre \\"chick-lit\\" but I feel that it cheats the reader. As a result the reader is only allowed into the shallow and at times discombobulated head of one Blair Mallory.  This superficial space cadet has a very roundabout way of thinking so the reader will be forced to swim through noisy and at times pointless chatter that takes pages to get through with the final destination being a one sentence revelation.  By the time you arrive at this location you the reader will wonder what was that and more importantly why did I just have to go through that?<br /><br />Another problem that I have with this read is we are not allowed to learn what Wyatt thinks or feels and so that portion of the \\"romance\\" is lacking.  Here we have a hero but know nothing about him except what we learn from Blair.  They (Blair and Wyatt) have had a past that we were introduced to by Blair herself but we are not given Wyatt's interpretation of events.  As a result the nonsense that goes on between these two again is childish and taxing to read.  The murder of Nicole and how it relates to Blair...well lets just say this reader could have cared less by the middle of the book let alone the end.  Yes, I did finish this book due to the fact that one of my favorite authors penned it but I must say I'm feeling twice bitten here.<br /><br />Ms. Howard's last two efforts seem as if they have been written by someone else.  Ms. Howard is such a talented author and personally I feel that she didn't need to change a thing when it came to her style.  This was a very difficult read for me and first person POV did not help matters at all.  If on the other hand you have no problems with this book that won't be an issue for you.  You may have a problem with Blair.  She is a hard character to understand let alone like.  Since this story is told from her view point you get to know her real well.  I only hope that Ms. Howard's next effort is better than the previous or I may just be forced to borrow her books from the library instead of investing money in them.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]er style.

Ms. Solomon has penned a story that has been a long time in coming. Neither main character is perfect. Our hero Danny is blind, and our heroine Martha is homely. Together they find a way to deal with what life has given them and at the same time find love. This is not to say that this is easy...it's not, but they deal with what life deals them and come out in the end better.<br /><br />Danny has not had an easy life. He watched his mother work herself into an early grave. He made a promise the day they scattered her ashs that he would take care of his younger sister Beth. He has done just that but when a police bust goes bad Danny receives an injury that does not appear right away but when it does his whole life will change. Days later he is in the middle of another deal when the lights go out. He can see nothing. Danny who is a cop and needs to see in order to do his job is now blind and the doctors tell him that in all probablity he won't see ever again. He now must re-learn everything from dressing to eating. Martha is going to help him learn provided he tries. He is not willing to give up yet. This is only a temporary thing it has to be.<br /><br />Martha went to school with the beautiful Danny. He is drop dead gorgeous and would not give her a second thought if he could see her. Well, he can't and she has a job to do. Teach him how to be self sufficient. While at his house teaching how to get around an intruder comes and attacks Danny. Martha is injured and now the two are on the run. Someone wants Martha and Danny dead but who? Is this from one of Danny's old cases or is it a new case. While on the run they are both dependant on the other. Danny teaches Martha that physical looks although importanat are not the only way a person can fall in love. Marthat teaches Danny that even though you may like to stand on your own two feet, it's not a bad thing to need help. Can they stay one step ahead of a killer to realize a happy ending?<br /><br />This was a very good book which did not rely on beautiful people to tell the tale. As a result Danny and Martha are two characters that readers can relate to. The story line was a fast paced one with a fair amount of description regarding the changes that Danny had to make in order to function, as well as the suspense storyline on who was trying to kill them and why. Ms. Solomon's descriptive way of writing showed us how frustrating Danny's situation was and as a result this was one of my favorite parts of the story. I could see and feel his struggle and frustration. This was truly a very good book and I look forward to reading her back list. Ms. Soloman is an author I have no problem recommending.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]very good book which did not rely on beautiful people to tell the tale.

Ms. Raye's latest offering is overall a fun story that will offer the reader not  an unusual storyline.  The characters are just as colorful but difficult to feel overly connected to.<br /><br />Without a doubt Ms. Raye has a very good sense of humor and she exericises it in her latest book.  Since I have not had the pleasure to read the previous title in this series I was able to come to this read with an open mind.  I did feel though that the author had a hard time determining who she wanted her main character to be.  Xandra was at turns both amusing and annoying. In any event the main characters Xandra and Beau just didn't speak to me as a reader and as a result I didn't feel invested in their growing relationship.  This is the reason for the three star rating.<br /><br />Overall this was a fun story if you can discount not being able to feel invested in the characters.  Ms. Raye is an author I will read again but I'm not sure if I will continue on with this series.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-01-12

If you don't expect much coming into this read you won't be disappointed with how it plays out.  I know that this sounds harsh but the fact remains that although Ms. Sala is a wonderful author this effort was not up to her usual standards.<br /><br />Without going into a synopsis and therefore potentially ruining the story for readers, suffice it to say that this was a rather formulatic read that left me well...not satisfied.  What was the exact problem you ask?  Well, for one it was technical issues that made the biggest issues for me. POV at times was a bit confusing, plot direction...scattered.  Characters were good and even interesting but this was a story about Frankie and Clay and I at times was more drawn to the villian in the piece.  What made him tick?  Although this is an important question readers should also be drawn to the main characters.  For this reader that was not the case.<br /><br />Ms. Sala has plenty of other efforts on her backlist (this is a re-issue) that are more worthy of her talent.  Ms. Sala was just a bit off her game and since she has blown me away in the past...I was a little let down.  Now...with that said, if you are new to this author and it is your first introduction you will find this a good read.  I do recommend that you pick up a few other titles to see what she is truly capable of doing though if you are a fan of romantic suspense.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-01-09

This was a good contemporary romance but what kept it from being \\"Great\\" was our hero Dalton.  Otherwise the use of the Karma Sutra as a vehicle for the story was unique and interesting.  If I could have been invested in both lead characters...well, that would have be wonderful.  But, since this was not meant to be I have to say that if you are looking for a good story this will fit the bill but don't llok for it to be outstanding.<br /><br />Dalton has been burned bad by his ex-wife. She was a wild child as it were.  She was into anything that would bring excitement.  As a result Dalton is all about living as plain a life as he can.  His safe life is about to come to an end one snowy night when Annie comes to make a delivery.  But one bad snow storm  and one undelivered message later Annie and Dalton have discovered that they are attracted to each other and being snowed in might not be such a bad thing.  That is if Dalton can get over the fact that he is falling for a woman that is well...not his normal cup of tea.  Will he be able to get over the fact that Annie like to seek excitement and that she reminds him too much of his ex?<br /><br />Annie is a high school math teacher.  She and her girlfriends make a pact to do something to \\"jazz\\" up their lives.  Annie takes a job during the Christamas break as a messenger for a strip-o-gram company.  Her first message is to Dalton.  Problem is Dalton is not what she thought he would be.  He's yummy and cute, has the cutest dogs but they are to different.  She comes to the realization that their time together has not only been HOT in all caps but she knows that they will never last.  Opposites may attract but they don't always stay together.  Especially when she realizes that she is having to live down the reputation of an e-wife.<br /><br />This was a very sensual read and it had a lot of potential.  Like I stated earlier this book was not \\"great\\" because the hero just...wasn't that great a hero.  He labors under his mis-guided thinking for the entire book.  He finally comes to his senses ten pages from the end of the book.  This is not to say that I couldn't understand where he was coming from but after awhile his problem took away from the romance.  Secondary characters are wonderful additions to this story and are also saving graces with their sub-plots.

This is the first time I've ever read Jayel Wylie and her new series under her pen name Lucy Blue is off to a great start with the first in the series \\"My Demon's Kiss.\\"<br /><br />Ms. Blue has taken the vampire legend and re-worked it taking a few myths from here and there thereby creating her own workable legend.  Add to this new storyline, bright and life like characters and you have the makings of a very good story.<br /><br />Simon, Knight of Lyan life changes while on the Crusades.  His lord is about to take to wife a demon and the night of the ceremony Simon not only looses the one man that was both mentor and adopted father (Duke of Lyan) he also looses his mortality with the deadly kiss of Kivar.  After he turns into the immortal vampire Simon he is told of a legend that could break the curse of the vampire.  He must find the Chalice of King Arthurs fame.  His quest takes him back to England and Castle Charmot.  Here he will find more than he ever thought possible.  He finds love and he will do all that he can to protect the one thing he never thought would be his.<br /><br />Isabel holds Castle Charmot by a very frayed thread.  When Simon shows up at her door in the middle of the night claiming to be her cousin she opens her door to him and his companion not realizing that her life would never be the same after that one action.  Isabel is drawn to the dark Simon.  He smiles but it doesn't reach his eyes.  He tries to maintain a distance that she doesn't understand...or want.  He makes her feeel things that are new to her and no matter how hard she tries she can't escape the attraction that she feels.  When demon's seem to be hunting the woods near her home, and horrid murders are being discovered she realizes her life could be in more danger than ever before.

What she doesn't understand is that the mysterious actions that began taking place were in direct result of Simon.<br /><br />Simon tries but can't turn his back on Isabel.  Soon the become lovers and it's only a matter of time before Isabel is made aware of Simon's dark curse.  He doesn't want to see fear and revulsion in the eyes of his love.  He soon learns that he didn't have to worry about that.  Isabel loves him and with her help he begins to set wrongs right...but not before he makes a very important mistake.<br /><br />This was a very fast paced read.  I can understand why this was a \\"Top Pick\\" for RT magazine.  Ms. Blue has penned a romance that is at once suspenseful and sensual.  The legend of the Vampire can be done either in the tried and true way or as in this case with a twist.  We are left with our appetites wetted for the next in the series.

Ms. Enoch is a truly talented author but her latest offering has fallen a bit short of what she normally provides her readers.  Overall this was your typical regency set romance.  What was not typical was the unlikable heroine Eleanor.<br /><br /> I wanted to like Nell.  I truly did...but she came off as petulant, spoiled, and self serving.  These were just some of her finer qualities!  She wants one thing but ignores her inner voice when it tells her she is about to partake in a particular activity that perhaps she would be better off avoiding.  The fact that she does the exact thing (not thinking and acting like a twit at the ripe old age of 21) that her brothers were \\"protecting\\" her from does not increase her \\"likeability factor\\" at all.  For the entirety of the read she \\"wants\\" one thing but doesn't know what it is.  Okay.  But does she take time to figure out what that \\"something\\" is?  The answer is no.<br /><br />Valentine on the other hand is your typical rake hero.  He lives a life that is well...rather colorful and he has no real use from woman (this is part of his past) and so when Eleanor's brother calls in a favor and asks Valentine to \\"watch\\" over Nell to make sure that she doesn't bring scandal to the proper Griffin name, Valentine is justifiably shocked.  He represents \\"Sin\\" personified!  Now honor demands that he watch out for the impetuous Nell.  What he can't understand is why he is suddenly seeing her in a new light.<br /><br />This was an okay read.  Again it's hard to get invested in a read when one or both of the main characters turn you off.  I did try to put myself in Nell's shoes and I could understand how she would have felt rather smothered by her protective older brothers.  What I couldn't understand was her flaky behavior.  There really seemed to be no rhyme or reason for what she did.  Valentine was the better of the two and even he at times made me frustrated.  Basically this is not the best that this author can do and I can't tell you how hard that is for me to say.  I love Ms. Enoch and buy her books simply because her name is on the cover.  I will continue to do so and I recommend that if you are new to this author, please don't judge her off of this effort.  She has many worthy titles on her backlist that I highly recommend.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]tell you how hard that is for me to say.

You are ALWAYS guaranteed a good historical read.  Her characters are always vibrant and alive and Patrick and Catherine are no exception.  These two strike sparks from their first introduction and it doesn't end there.  As a result it was fun to read how these two very strong willed people were able to find love between themselves without loosing that which set them apart.<br /><br />Readers that might be new to Ms. Henley might be put off by the strong-willed nature of Catherine...okay, Catherine is a brat to put it mildly.  But she will be tamed by her Scot.  Patrick is beyond patient with her and understands her better than she understands herself.  The fact that he has the capability to see her thoughts gives him the added insight he needs to love her the way she deserves. Her past has dictated the way she acts and he understands this.  He sets about to gain her without killing her spirit.<br /><br />With the back drop of Queen Elizabeth's court and all of the intrigue that came with this time period, fans of historical romance will be well pleased.  Ms. Henley truly has a talent for transporting her reader into whatever time period or location her creative mind chooses.  As a result the reader will not only be gifted with a sensual and romantic story, but they will also be given a small lesson in history.<br /><br />This is one historical I have no problem recommending and doing so highly.

This has been my favorite episode to date for many different reasons.  This is not to say that the other three stories in Ms. Kent's SG-5 series aren't any good.  On the contrary they have all been winners.  Kelly John was just such a sensual character as well as a battle harden man that you can't help but find him yummy.<br /><br />This was a fast readd (again only 116 pages long) so Ms. Kent has packed a lot into very little.  The relationship between Emma and Kelly John (K.J.) as a result of the short length of the story is fast and hot.  So what's my point you ask?  Don't expect this story to be as detailed as a full length story.  If you come to this book realizing this you will find that this story is a perfect addition to this on going storyline.<br /><br />Spectra IT is still at it and the person that had helped Tripp in the \\"Shaughnessey Accord\\" is back only he is not helping the Smithson group.  Kelly John has been caught in a compromising situation so the group scrambles to make things right.  Unfortunatly it'a to late and the one woman that has finally helped Kelly John find the light in his life again is captured.  Kelly John now must find a way to save Emma without loosing the one thing he thought he'd never find again...his heart.  Can he be the hero that she needs?<br /><br />I love how Ms. Kent has created this series.  Each book is like an episode that helps to tell the story that begun with \\"The Bane Affaire.\\"  I can hardly wait to see what will happen next in the \\"Mackenzie Artifact.\\"  Ms. Kent has a winner and I highly recommend this author and her series.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2005-01-03

This is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Steffen and it won't be the last.  This read was a wonderfully emotional read that really took a hard look at several different aspects of relationships, and how things that can go wrong can often times be the beginning of a wonderful new start.<br /><br />Three high school friends go three different directions after they graduate from high school.  The different paths that these each take lead back home to Alcott N.H. when the going gets tough.  And it gets tough for all three for very different reasons.  Brooke has married what she thinks is the best man in the world.  They live a reasonably successful life until Colin's ability to stay faithful to Brooke a second time forcs Brooke to take a long hard look at who she has become.  With her daughter by her side she heads home to help her sister Eve plan her wedding to town bad-boy.  What she finds is peace, and a new sense of self as she makes new friends, and renews old friendships with her high school buddies.<br /><br />Sara is one of Brooke's dearest friends.  She has stayed in Alcott after she married and had a child.  Her life changes after her husband starts beating her.  She has finally left her abusive husband and is working on being the woman she knows she can be.  It's not easy but when you have friends by your side anything is possible.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least is Claudia.  She is the last of the \\"Potter Girls\\" and she has come back to Alcott for a totally different reason.  She has finally found love...but is afraid to admit it to herself.  She runs back home under the guise of being supportful of Brooke and Sara's problems.  She learns that you can't run from yourself, and certainly not when you problem follows you.  Julian finally lays down the gauntlet.  He wants her for her and will settle for nothing else.  Will Claudia find the courage to love with her whole heart?<br /><br />This was an amazing story that managed to balance several different storylines while never cheating one of them.  That is quiet a feat and one that not many authors are capable of doing.  The relationship between Brooke and Mac is tender, sweet, and yes, even sensual but proper.  She is after all a married woman.  The secondary storylines of her friends Sara and Claudia are not only entertaining but look at very sensitive subjects (spousal abuse, and older woman in love with younger man) but help to tell Brooke's story (you'll just have to buy the book.)<br /><br />Secondary characters such as Sophie, Archie, and even Colin all bring wonderful things to this story.  I laughed and I cried while reading the book. I highly recommend Ms. Steffen if you enjoy reads that look at hard issues but at the same time show the silver linings to any situation.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]nce several different storylines while never cheating one of them.

I'm hard pressed to pick a favorite as all three stories were different but offered fun qirky characters and fun storylines.<br /><br />Two of the stories (offered by Nina Bangs and MaryJanice Davidson) are paranormal.  Ms Davidson's trade mark wit and humor are more than evident, and Ms. Bang's trademark sensuality is buring hot and bright.  Ms. Denison brings back together two lovers that have not forgotten the other...nor the hurt that caused them to separate.  But fear not they both take advantage of the second chance they are offered.<br /><br />These were not \\"blow your mind reads\\" but they were good from some of today's best authors.  Why not a higher rating than?  Well, since they are such talented authors and I've read several of their full lenghth stories I expected a little more from them.  Still this was a fun book if you are wanting a book to read that will not be time consuming and quick than this is the read for you.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-12-26

I can't tell you how much this pains me, but I found this book wholly uninspiring and a very large letdown.  A few of these stories have potential but fall short of the mark on being...well, even good.  This might have something to do with lenghth of each story.  What saves this book from being rated even lower is my love of Ms. Kenyon's ability to tell a story, and even hers was a bit of a let down.<br /><br />In short these are stories that would have probably been better in full lenghth versions as I feel that all the authors tried to do too much with too little time.  Let's face it...these are all very talented authors that I read frequently and as a result expected more than I probably should have.  I suggest picking the book up but doing so with lowered expectations.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-12-26

I'm so glad that Ms. James is back writing and her second in her new series is wonderful.  We were briefly introduced to our stunning hero  Justin in the first book \\" A Perfect Bride\\" and this handsome rake now has his very own story.<br /><br />Justin has been carrying around a horrible secret.  The relationship that he had with his father has left deep and lasting scars.  He feels that he must be everything his father has accused him of and has set out to live his life as a hard-hearted rake.  That is until he is induced into a wage that has him wooing his childhood nemisis Arabella.  The hoyden from his past has turned into a stunning beauty and she just may hold the key to his future.<br /><br />Arabella is everything most men in society shy away from.  She is rather tall, has flaming red hair, and has a tendency to speak her mind.  She also only plans on marrying for love.  So when she comes face-to-face with the one man she has sworn to find nasty and faithless, kissing her senseless...she must rethink her stand on the topic of Justin.  He has touched her heart and he is truly the only man that has the power to break her heart as well.  Does he have what it takes to be the \\"perfect groom\\" and love her for herself and be true to her?<br /><br />This was a wonderful read that explores the issue of mental child abuse and how it affects the adult that has suffered.  Justin is a wounded hero, who at the same time tries to flaunt societies rules, secretly wants to be worthy of the one woman he finds himself falling for.  Arabella is a true heroine in the fact that although she does act like a twit is still able to allow herself to feel for the wounded Justin.  These two are meant for each other and although this is not a new storyline, Ms. James does an excellent job of making it fresh. Ms. James is true to her characters and she has woven the resulting childhood issue very well into the man that Justin becomes.  Despite his best effort he has a heart and this is truly a story about him finding it.<br /><br />I highly recommend Ms. James latest effort and eagerly look forward to the next in the series!<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]is truly a story about him finding it.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend Ms. James latest effort and eagerly look forward to the next in the series! <br /> <br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-12-26

Ms. Hall has penned an amazingly engrossing read that fans of romantic suspense won't want to miss.  The storyline is amazing combining not only a great mystery that transcends a decade, but also has great characters that readers will relate too and care about.  The ending (without giving any thing away) truly surprised me and I'm an avid fan of this sub-genre and normally pretty good about \\"guessing\\" who the baddie is.<br /><br />Lt. J.D. Gamble has had his past catch up with him in the most unlikely of locations.  A burned out building with only one survivor.  Sable Duchensne was his first and only love and she is currently getting looked over by the EMT when he shows up.  She is the only witness to a murder and arson investigation.  He has to put his own personal feelings on ice but it won't be easy.  Than again nothing with Sable ever was.<br /><br />Sable has a secret.  She's from the bayou and when she was in college she thought to step ahead of her station in life and love Jean Delano Gamble.  After a very bad incident she runs back home and away from her hearts desire.  Ten years later their paths cross and the one person to keep her safe is the one person she can't trust with her heart.  Or can she.  While on the run hiding from a person that wants her dead, she and D.J. come to realize that the still love each other very much and that they are not going to make the same mistake they made earlier.<br /><br />This was a very fast paced read set in sultry Louisiana.  Plot, characters, and chemistry move the story along and will firmly engage the reader until the final pages.  If you are a fan of the romantic suspense genre Ms. Hall is an author that you need add to your \\"must read\\" list.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-12-25

Ms. Kent's latest SG-5 episode is Julian Samms story and it's just has hot as the previous titles.  This is a very short story with a total of 117 pages.  As a result you will get a whole lot out of very little.<br /><br />Julian Samms has a dark past and as a result he likes to get in do his job, and get out.  That changes when he tangles with the beautiful Katrina Flurry.  She is not fitting into his mental slot of being a high maintenance flirty piece of work.  Instead she turns all of his perceptions on their ear.  His job is to keep her alive.  He can do that without falling in love.  Right?<br /><br />Katrina has bad taste in men and now her last boyfriend has left his mark on her...someone wants her dead and they are not going to stop hunting her until she is pushing up daisies.  On top of all that the man that is suppose to keep her alive makes her melt.  He is yummy, and bad, and she wants him.  All she has to do is stay alive.  No problem...<br /><br />This was a fast paced read and the attraction and chemistry is instant between Julian and Katrina.  Despite the lenghth this was a well fleshed out read.

Ms. Joyce is back penning her extraordinary historical romances and I am THRILLED!!  I can't understand why anyone would find fault with this story.  Ms. Joyce has taken exceptional care in research and her diligence has paid off by offering her readers a story rich with historic details that will pull you into a time and place that no longer exists.  The reader will travel to Ireland, England, and back to Virginia in this epic love story.<br /><br />Characters are such an important part of any story and Devlin and Virginia are amazing.  Devlin is a product of his past (he witnesses the cruel murder of his father when he is only 10) and as a result has lived his life from that moment on with one goal in mind revenge at all costs.  Problem with this is that it has cost him more than even he could imagine.  He is set on his course and when an opportunity presents its self he grabs it and runs.  His life is never going to be the same and its all going to change due to a large set of Violet eyes.  Virginia may be his enemy's niece but she is about to become his soul.<br /><br />Virginia is on her way to England with hopes to talk her uncle into saving her family's plantation \\"Sweet Briar\\" since it is currently up for sale.  She is only days away from realizing her dream when her ship is boarded and she is taken hostage by Captain Devlin O'Neill.  She fights him from the first moment she sets eyes on him but this blonde and strong man calls to her and it's only a matter of time before she looses her heart to the one man that doesn't want it.  Can she show Devlin that there's more to life than justice and revenge?<br /><br />This is an amazing story and Ms. Joyce is true to her characters.  Some readers might loose patience with Virginia's willingness to continue to feel any kind of soft emotion for Devlin.  Devlin is so consumed with his revenge that it's amazing that Virginia is able to get through to his heart.  The chemistry between these two very strong people is immediate and hot.  Virginia's willingness to see the good in Devlin is what makes her such an amazing character.  Secondary characters (Devlin's family) are just as important as the main characters and I'm highly looking forward to the next in this series, which is Ty's story.  This is a complex love story that I highly recommend.  Be forewarned this is a book that totals 575 pages but it is well worth taking the time to read.  Fans of true historical romances will not be disappointed with Ms. Joyce's latest effort.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]is immediate and hot.

Ms. Hooper is one of the best when it comes to the paranormal suspense genre.  She has kicked off a new series with \\"Hunting Fear\\" and if this is any indication of how good this series is going to be...well, lets just say you won't want to miss a single title.<br /><br />Bishop is back with his crime fighting team that uses more than police investingation techiques to catch the bad guy.  In Ms. Hoopers latest Lucas Jordan is tracking a serial kidnapper that takes the victim, askes for the ransom, and than kills the victim all without leaving any clues behind.  Luke as been on his trail for eighteen months when the case takes a turn and becomes very personal.  Now the clock is ticking and his past has now caught up to his future but is he strong enough to deal with the fear that lives inside of him?<br /><br />Samantha Burke has not had an easy life.  She lives day to day working as a seer for a carnival and it's one night at the carnivale that she picks up an item and has a vision.  She knows that she must face her past and that means dealing with Lucas Jordan.  But that's okay because she has the strength to do what she must in order to stop a serial killer that hunts a person's fear.<br /><br />This was a strong paranormal romance that fans of Ms. Hooper will inhale.  This is a complex story with equally complex characters.  Readers will be drawn to both Lucas and Sam for very different reasons.  Their chemistry is intense but will not overshadow the main storyline and that is catching a killer before he has a chance to kill again.

Secondary characters and storylines are also well done and bring something special to this story.<br /><br />Seldom do debut efforts speak to a reader.

This book was a big disappointment for me as this was the first time I've ever read Ms. Taylor and I was looking forward to a good romantic suspense.<br /><br />Why the low rating you ask? First off, who were the main characters suppose to be.  We learned more about the secondary characters Lizzie and Dylan than we did Holly and Jake. This storyline had great potential.  They grew up together and had deep feeling for each other but a misunderstanding tore them apart.  Now a wedding brings Holly back to town after 10 years Jake and Holly see each other for the first time.  Were there sparks?  No...in fact they were together so little, the ending (the happily ever after...for everyone) was cliched and...rather a let down.<br /><br />This was a story that was billed as a suspense.  Where was the suspense.  The cast of characters was small and the \\"baddie\\" had to come from them in order for it to be a \\"personal\\" attack issue.  At one point I didn't care who the bad guy was.<br /><br />The ending was rushed.  Over two hundred pages was taken to bring our lovers together (I'm counting both couples here...) and the ending was summed up in less than five pages.  Okay...why did it take over two hundred pages to bring us to that point?<br /><br />I'll try another read by Ms. Taylor before I consider not reading her again.  I hope that another of her efforts is better than this one.

This is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Hall, and needless to say I've gone and ordered her entire backlist after reading this story.  I came to this story not being aware of the foundation that had been laid in the previous title \\"Into The Fire\\" so I was unaware of the previous relationship between our hero Cort and our sassy heroine Terri.  This was not a problem and in fact was what prompted me to purchase her other books.<br /><br />Cort and Terri have a certain chemistry that pulls them together even though they try so hard to fight what they both want.  Terri is a first rate police detective and Cort is the fire marshal they are brought together yet again due to the case that they are both working on.  Ex-girlfriends of Cort's are finding themselves being killed by a serial arsonist.  Why is he targeting Cort?  Terri is assigned to act as his \\"fianc&eacute;e\\" and this is going to be easier said than done.  Terri rides a Harley and fishes.  She is not into the clothes, make-up, and hair that good society girls are into.  This could be a problem...a big one.<br /><br />Cort and Terri are wonderfully complex characters.  I truly enjoyed how their story unfolded.  There is a section of the book that reminded me of a portion of \\"Miss Congeniality\\" and was a wonderfully funny part of the story that truly showed us Terri at her best.  The suspense portion of the story was very intense and managed to keep the reader in the dark until the final unveiling.

This is not to say that this story was flawless because it did at time drag and at times the storyline seemed a bit contrived.<br /><br />All in all Diana was a strong heroine that knew her mind and had her dreams.  She also found love where she least likely thought she would find it.  In the arms of Viscount Thorn.  Christopher is a member of a secret organization that protects those that are unable to.  One of their members is killed and it is thought to have been the bad luck of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  One year later Nat's sister and cousin come to find Christopher in order to obtain his help in launching Amy so she can find a suitable husband.  Thorn agrees to do this as long as Diana posses as his fiancee.  What starts off as an act swifty becomes a reality.  But will their new love be threatened by an enemy before they realize how deep it actually is?<br /><br />As I stated in the beginning of this review the chemistry between Diana and Thorn was very sensual and immediate.  The whole \\"let's pretend that we love each other...than they find they do\\" is not a new story vehicle and Ms. Jordan has truly not done anything to change that.  What saved this story from being too...uninspiring is the collection of characters such as Amy, John Yates, and the Duke.  Ms. Jordan is without a doubt one of the queens of the sensual romance and this story is no exception.

This was a wonderful book that I was loath to put down until I finished the final page.  Ms. Cooper-Posey has penned an amazing suspense read that offered so many twists and turns and wonderful characters that I was totally drawn into her world.<br /><br />Two strangers meet under the most challenging circumstance.  Jack Laubreaux and Sophie Kingston are the only survivors of a plane crash.  Sophie has suffered a severely broken leg and Jack has suffered a sever head injury as a result of the crash.  Together the hunker down and wait for rescue with Jack realizing two very important things.  One, he feels responsible for the crash that left five other people dead, and two, he doubts that the rescue will take place very soon.  He will do all that he can to protect Sophie before he succumbs to his injury.  Along the way these two very different people grow close on that mountain ledge and when they are finally rescued and taken to the hospital Sophie is told that Jack has died as a result of his injuries.  She is left bereft and carries on with life, even marrying someone that reminds her of Jack but it doesn't last.  She gets on with life and when she spots a stranger walking along the road she immediately thinks of Jack.  The man that saved her life and touched her heart eight years earlier that she had not been able to say goodbye to.<br /><br />Jack has been on the road trying to stay one step ahead of the person that wants him dead, and at the same time find a life worth living.  It's only a coincidence that leads him to Serenity Falls, that and the fact that he is drawn to the mountains every winter.  He can't believe his eyes when he sees Sophie for the first time since he lost consciences on the mountain.  Now all of the feelings he thought he had buried rise to the top and although he knows he should leave he can't and instead allows himself to draw close to her again.  This time he wants the happy ending but will he be able to have it before the \\"Silent Knight\\" catches up with him?<br /><br />The chemistry between Sophie and Jack is wonderful.  I love how Ms. Cooper-Posey manages to build the respect and attraction between these two very strong people.  Their first kiss is so worth the wait and in my opinion is one of the most romantic kisses that I've read.  The suspense of this story is top drawer, and the reader will truly be kept guessing who the bad guy is and how this person relates to Jack.  This was truly a high-octane read and when combined with the romantic storyline that Ms. Cooper-Posey has created this is a book that will leave the reader completely satisfied.

Her ability to create characters that the reader can connect with and laugh with is what sets her apart from other authors.<br /><br />In her latest effort this does not change.  We are introduced to Felicity Charm and Michael Magee.  Both are characters that do a fairly good job at hiding who they really are.  That is until Lissie and Michael run into each other literally.  Now all bets are off, and both need to face the fact that what they thought they wanted and needed might not be exactly how they figured.<br /><br />Felicity comes from a family of...con-artists and scammers.  She has worked real hard at getting rid of the \\"charm\\" in her life.  She is a very successful shopping network hostess.  She has just won the \\"Joanie\\" (this equals the golden globe in T.V. awards) and feels that she can now work on the idea of proving to Drew (her boss) that she is worthy of being a little more to him than an employee.  But...all of this comes to a crashing end when she gets a call from Aunt Vi and a trip back home is put into play.  On said trip home she crashes into Michael and this is truly the beginning of a new and more realistic Lissie. Or is it?<br /><br />Michael can't believe that his very own piece of bad karma has just crashed into his Jeep.  He knows that his life is over as he knows it.  He has to keep a promise and although it's not exactly what he wants a promise is a promise.  Oh, and this promise does not include the sexy, sweet Lissie.  Saved by a tow truck (you'll just have to get the book) Michael goes his way and Lissie goes her way...right to the same place.  Now Magee is in more trouble than he ever was climbing mountains and rocks.  He has a bad case of \\"Lissie\\" and she is making his life miserable.  He wants her but can't have her...or can he?<br /><br />Magee and Felicity are great characters.  The reader will truly be able to connect with them both.  Neither is too pretty, or perfect and this makes their realationship all the more fun to read.  They both make bone headed mistakes (just like us fellow mortals) but are able to see the truth in the end.  Secondary characters such as Ashely and Jack add to this compelling storyline with one of their very own.  This is not to say that this is a story steeped in reality...it's not but it's a wonderful way to escape if only for a little while.

This is not to say that this is a story steeped in reality...it's not but it's a wonderful way to escape if only for a little while.  I highly recommend Ms. Ridgeway laugh and loved filled reads! <br /> <br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-12-12

Ms. Kelley's debut effort is a strong romantic suspense which will keep the reader coming back for more until the final page. Although this is not a long read (it totals 237 pages) Ms. Kelley has managed to pack a lot into very little and the reader will come away satisfied.<br /><br />Fallon Hargis is an undercover DEA agent that has had her cover blown by an insider.  Barely escaping with her life she runs from her would be killers right into the strong arms of Wade Tanner.  Under the threat of gun point she forces the handsome man into bed in order make do her skin of the teeth escape.  Where this action leads to is far from what she planned on but it's the one thing she needs.<br /><br />Wade can not believe what is happening to him.  One moment he's on vacation trying to enjoy himself, the next he's in bed with one sexy lady who just so happens to be bleeding all over him.  Fallon is everything that he has walked away from but she is also the one thing he can't forget.  She's sassy, fun, stubborn, and ill-tempered.  She has also brought him back to life.  Can he turn his back on a damsel in distress?  Heck no and before either of them knows it they are in it together for the long haul, or at least until Fallon can determine who sold her out to the bad guys.<br /><br />This was a fun read with great characters.  Fallon although stubborn and at times over the top will be a character that will stay with the reader long after you finish the book.  Wade is your typical southern gentleman and he is a perfect complement to Fallon.  I look forward to reading Ms. Kelley in the future she is a talent we can look forward too.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-12-12

Ms. Ciotta's second effort \\"Charmed\\" has compelled me to add this very talented author to my \\"must read\\" list simply because her name is on the cover.  This was not only well written, but also funny, romantic, endearing, snd...charming story.  After all the main character Lulu Ross does dress up as Princess Charming, in order to entertain childern during their birthday parties. She also has a thing for the color pink, and carries a pink poodle purse. With a quirky fun character such as Lulu how can you loose?<br /><br />In addition to having a truly likeable heroine and yummy hero Colin Murphy, we also get to visit with old friends Rudy, Jean Pierre, Jake, and Afia all from the first book \\"Jinxed.\\"  If you've already read the previously mentioned title all I have to ask is why have you not bought this one!!!<br /><br />This is not just a light hearted romance but a romantic suspense as well.  No one can combine the same amount of tension (sexual as well as suspense) and humor as Ms. Ciotta does with the same stunning results.  I highly recommend this read and her previous effort \\"Jinxed\\". I can't wait for the next in this fun series \\"Seduced.\\"  Ms. Ciotta is an author you won't want to miss!<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-12-10

This story was epic in nature and truly a wonderful addition to the historical fiction genre.<br /><br />One of the problems with historical fiction is that authors seem to be in such a hurry to tell their story that they only outline the historical significance and than move on to whatever story the plan to tell.  Ms. Shaw is the exception to the rule.  She has taken great care and paid attention to details when describing the trials and tribulations of the Irish during the potato famine that took place in 1846-47. She also took the same amount of care when she wrote about Margaret's new life in America working toward better working conditions and struggling in a new country where old customs have no place. As a result the reader has no problem seeing, smelling, hearing, and most importantly feels the pain and despair, and triumphs of our heroine Margaret Meehan Riordan.  She is strong and never gives up. She buries both family and friends, and watches what is left of her precious Ireland starve and die.  With her love Tom by her side she forges a new life for herself in America.  Never loosing sight of who she is or where she came from.<br /><br />This amazing read which left me both laughing and cheering. The reader will feel truly invested with Margaret and her Tommy and I can truly say I was sad when I came to the end and had to say goodbye. I hope that there is another story in the works of this amazing family. I highly recommend this read and suggest if you are a fan of a well-written historical novel look no further.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-12-07

Ms. Lee is truly a wonderful voice in romance and her reads are not only fast but extremly entertaining.  I managed to read this story in one day and was so sad to say goodbye at the very end.<br /><br />The secondary storyline of Ben's was just as good as the romance between him and Julia.  Both are wounded in different ways but see beyond the hurt of the other to what lays deep down.  This was a very sensual read and one that I highly recommend without any qualms.  For a wonderful read that you can sink into I suggest Ms. Lee.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-12-06

Ms. Adaire's latest in the \\"Wright Family\\" series is well worth the money spent on purchasing the hardback.  This read is full of action packed adventure in a great location plus a yummy hero who is both capable of being a tough guy, but sweet as well.<br /><br />Derek Wright has been in love with the stubborn, sweet, and sassy Lily Munroe for the past six years.  She is now a widow and he is done waiting for her.  He will chase her as far as he has to in order to prove to her that he will be there for the long haul.<br /><br />Lily doesn't know that Derek is a T-FLAC operative and so she is stunned when it turns out the simple \\"accidents\\" she has been having have not been accidents at all, and that they are tied to a terrorist operation that Derek has been called to work on while they are both running the Iditarod in Alaska.  Now it will be up to Derek to keep them both safe, and save a small part of the world at the same time.  Will Lily finally trust in her heart and allow herself to love Derek, or will she loose everything?<br /><br />This was a great read and in my opinion Ms. Adair is top drawer in the romantic suspense genre.  She creates great characters that tell their own story while entertaining the reader.  Some people may be put off on Lily and think that she is overly stubborn or outright silly.  Her past has shaped who she is when we meet her, so readers should keep this in mind.  Ms. Adair is actually true to the character.  Fan's of romantic suspense have a true gift in Ms. Adair.

This is the first time I've ever read anything by the very talented Anna Jeffrey's and it won't be the last.  This story combined wonderful strong characters and a great storyline that kept me glued to the pages. At times Isabelle (our heroine) was a little too headstrong and stubborn but than again it's true to character since she is truly had a hard life.<br /><br />Isabella has come home to Idaho in order to spend more time with her family and her daughter.  She has sold everything and left Texas with the hope that her new start will be just what she needs.

One words says it all when it comes to Ms. Mercury's story \\"The Hinterlands\\" and that is AMAZING!  This is a wonderful read that will take the reader on a journey to a time and place seldom visited in historical fiction.  Ms. Mercury took great care and effort to research the time and place (Nigeria, Benin City, Edo..etc.) so the reader will truly feel as if they have stepped into 1896 Africa.  Rich details, use of local language, and customs all combine with wonderful characters, and a sensual romance that will have readers captivated from the first page.<br /><br />Elle Bowie is an anthropologist that has traveled to Africa to study the various customs of the native people.  She brings with her Rip Bowie who is suppose to be her husband but is instead her friend and photographer.  Elle may be looking for one thing but she finds another when she meets Brendan Donivan who is known for his hunting and trading skills with the locals.<br /><br />Brendan is no fool and when he meets the beautiful but spirited Elle he thinks there is more to her than meets the eye.  He's right but now is not the time to ponder the mysteries of Elle.  The local government is on the brink of war and there are questions on who can be trusted.  Still the attraction these two very strong people feel will not be denied.  Amongst the seductive African backdrop and very sensual romance takes shape.  Still there is danger and they must watch their backs because a land on the brink of war is not safe for anyone.<br /><br />Ms. Mercury has penned a very sensual and descriptive read that fans of historic fiction will not want to miss.  This story really brought to my mind the movie \\"African Queen\\".  As a fan of historical fiction I enjoy visiting locations that are new and different.  This read surely fit the bill.

Ms. Kleypas new \\"Wallflower Series\\" is off to a strong start with her latest effort.  Ms. Kleypas has the great ability to pen character driven reads and this story is just such an example.  Simon and Annebelle are complex characters that for whatever the reason find themselves not fitting into the society that they were desirous of joining.  As a result this is a push and pull type relationship that explores prejudice, and circumstances that lead our lives.<br /><br />Annebelle must marry into the aristocracy in order to save her family.  The problem with this is in the fact that her family can not provide her with a dowery.  As a result no one wants to marry the beautiful Annebelle.<br /><br />Simon Hunt is a self made man.  Son of a butcher, Simon has taken his considerable talents in finance and has made himself rich beyond compare.  Doors to polite society are firmly closed to him witht he rare exception of those in in peerage that are his friends, and those that owe him after he has helped them finacially.  Since the first time he saw her Simon wanted Annebelle, but the stubborn lass will have nothing to do with him despite the chemistry that they share.  When they find themselves at the same house party the long played cat and mouse game that they have been playing for years is about to come to a head.  Will they each find what they want in the most unlikely of places with each other?<br /><br />This was a strong read that will have the reader alternatly cheer and scolding both characters.  Annebelle at times will try the patience of the reader, but in the end she is redeemable.  Simon is a true hero for the simple fact that he never gives up on Annebelle.  Although he plans on making his mistress, he soon realizes that she is more than that to him.  Secondary characters such as Evie, Lillian, and Daisy (who just so happen make up the rest of the wallflowers) are great additions to the story.

This is the first read in the new trilogy that Ms. Callen has started.  Here we meet Jane Wittington and William Chadwick. Jane can't believe that her father has betrothed her to the dandy that he has.  Please, all he can do is talk about fashion, material, and any other inane thing that comes to mind.  Jane has dreams that don't include William.  Never mind the fact that he has the ear of the Queen and her father for some reason has decided he is the one for her.  Before she knows it she has set out for her fathers estate and the dandy and fop that she thought William to be is changing.  What on earth is going on?<br /><br />William is a retired spy.  He has been called back just one last time to help on a case of capturing a traitor.  He is ready to settle down with the lovely Jane, but the problem is he has no idea what a \\"proper\\" lord is suppose to do or how he is to act.  He thinks he has it down pat, but Jane seems rather...put off by the whole thing.  When his mentor and future father-in-law askes Will to bring Jane home, he does not think twice about the request, that is until he is pulled back into service.  Now he must use all of his talents to keep Jane in the dark about who and what he is, and at the same time keep her safe from the assassine that seems to trying to kill him, while keeping an eye on a traitor.  All in a days work...not!<br /><br />This was a fun read.  Ms. Callen has created some wonderful characters and if you're like me and read books out of order and have already read \\"Beauty and the Spy\\" then you will realize that these two stories take place at the exact same time!  Even so both reads stand alone fine.  Will and Jane are great characters, and Killer (I'm not going to ruin this for you, the reader) is a wonderful addition to the cast. At times the storyline does seem to bog itself down with the push and pull dance, that Will and Jane perform.  As a result I became frustrated just a few times and hence the lower rating.

Ms. Austin has taken the reader on a journey back into time weaving truth with fiction in such a way that she has managed to pen a read that is not only descriptive but good as well.<br /><br />This is the story of Hezekiah who will eventually assume the role of king as a descendent of King David.  This story opens with Hezekiah as a young boy and we grow with him as he faces many challenges to both his life, and his faith.  His father is King Ahaz, and he has plotted to sacrifice Hezekiah in order to gain the favor of the gods, and win the war that has currently decimated his army and killed his own brother.  Hezekiah's mother Abijah will do all that she can to spare her last son from his father's evil machinations.  She has only two men that she can rely on, but can she trust them to save her beloved son?<br /><br /> Hezekiah is destined for great things and manages to survive his childhood but he is now a man and the dangers to him have not dissipated.  He is now King, and his mother and his wife, two women that love Hezekiah, must now stand back, and wait to see if his faith is strong enough to help him survive the treachery and violence that surrounds him.  Will he be strong enough to stand by his beliefs and save his country?<br /><br />This was a very moving read as well as being very descriptive.

Ms. Tolnitch has penned a wonderful debut novel that is a spellbinding read that grabs the reader right from the start.  She has created wonderful characters that the reader will be able to relate too, and care about, and as a result Amice, Cain, Muriel, Gerard, will stay with the reader long after the final page is read.  Other secondary characters such as Lugh, Agatha, Piers, and Uncle Gifford are also wonderful additions to this stellar cast of characters.<br /><br />Amice and Cain have shared a past five years earlier.  Amice thought that their love was strong and true and they shared much and then Cain left to marry another leaving Amice feeling betrayed and wounded down to her very soul.<br /><br />Cain walks away from Amice thinking that she had been unfaithful, and that the needs of his family and his newly inherited title of Earl of Hawksdown requires that he make a good match that will fill family coffers and save the family estates.  He does this and marries a cruel and unfaithful woman.  Years after her death he finds his home plagued by a spirit that makes his life miserable to say the least.  He finally comes to his wits end and sends for \\"The Spirit Goddess\\" who just so happens to be Amice.  What happens from this request is anyone's guess but finding that their attraction has not cooled in the least is not what they expect to find.  Now Amice is driven to cast the spirit out if only to obtain the villa in Italy that she longs to runaway too.  If only it was that simple.  Instead Amice and Cain embark on a journey that is oftentimes painful but in the end will bring them their hearts desire.<br /><br />This was a wonderful paranormal romance.  Ms. Tolnitch has taken the plot of haunted house by upset spirit to a whole new level that is not only entertaining, but also fresh.

This is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms.Heitzmann so I came to this story with both an open mind and open heart.  Without going into a long and detailed synopsis suffice it to say that this is a strongly driven character read that will have the reader glued to the pages if only to see how Lance and Rese will finally deal with all of the baggage that they both carry.<br /><br />This story is full of rich and wonderful characters (including a dog that likes to ride a Harley) and wonderful descriptive scenes regarding Sonoma (I'm from this part of California) that places the reader right in the heart of this wonderful part of California.  Ms. Heitzmann uses the secrets of Nonna as another vehicle for this story, and as a result the mystery surrounding her request of Lance will also keep the reader firmly engaged. Rese may seem unlikable in the beginning of this story, but readers should give her a chance before writing her off.  Lance on the other hand seems almost too perfect except we the reader know from the beginning that he has a secret of his own.  As a result of this push and pull the romance between Rese and Lance is strongly written, and the reader can believe that they are truly falling in love with each other.

This story is rich with histocial details, historical figures, and characters that the reader will grow to love and we the reader will experience their ups and downs, joys and heartaches.<br /><br />Jasmine has moved on from the death of her first husband. She has made a life for herself and her son Spencer in Lowell, Ma. in a new home, with new friends. Her relationship with her brother-in-law Nolan is growing closer, and she has finally taken a stand on slavery as part of a group that has been helping those on the underground railroad on their way to Canada and freedom. Soon her world is turned upside down when she is requested to go back home to \\"The Willows\\". Her mother and her mammy are gravely ill and she is needed. When she is there Mammy askes her from her deathbed to find her own son and free him. Jasmine can do nothing less and with the help of Nolan she finds Mammy's son and takes him with his wife and son back to Lowell. Within no time life has fallen into a predictable but comfortable pattern until events happen that cause Jasmine to question her faith and to wonder what good could come from such despair.<br /><br />This was a wonderfully emotional read that draw the reader in and transport them back to a time that is long past, but has had long ranging repurcussions into society today.

This dream comes to an end when she has been forced into a marriage that will benefit the family.  She will move North and be the wife of a cotton purchaser.  Everyone keeps telling her that with time she may grow to love her husband.  Jasmine knows that, that day will never come.  Bradley is ambitious, driven, and puts work and money first.  He has no belief in God, and thinks that the only one that can help him is himself.  He wants Jasmine and is willing to mold her into the wife that he needs, and wants especially if it means professing his love.<br /><br />Jasmine though knows that his words are false, and with the help of her grandmother, and brother-in-law she finds hope and friendship in the cold north.  That is not the only change that Jasmine is forced to face.  She is also faced with the problems and lies of her former lifestyle considering the fact that her family owns slaves, and she has finally faced the fact that what she has always thought was also a lie.  Now she must make sense of what she always thought and what is real.<br /><br />This is truly an aspiring read.  Jasmine is both at the same time, spoiled and willful as well as being brave and grown-up.  In other words she is complex and her story will pull the reader in until the final page.

This was an amazingly funny read that fan's of chick lit should surly appreciate and those readers that may not naturally gravitate to chick lit will find this a worthwhile read that offers both a quirky look at travel and romance.<br /><br />This book is set up in journal, and e-mail format and the story is told through these formats via Jane Harris, and Cal Langdon as well as the secondary characters of Mark Levin, and Holly Caputo. Together these four will take us on a roller coaster ride of laughs on the way to an elopement in Italy of Mark and Holly. There is never a dull moment on the road to romance, and the final destination of matrimony will be no different, especially with Cal and Jane along for the ride. Cal is a cynic from the word go and does not believe in romance or love. Love is a chemical imbalance in the brain as far as he's concerned and the concept of people staying together for forty or fifty years proves that there is something very wrong with them. Jane on the other hand is a total romantic and knows that Mark and Holly are meant to be together no matter what. If this means that she has to stay in contact with Cal in order to prevent him from sabotaging not only the most romantic thing she has ever witnessed, but also ruin the first time she's ever been out of the good 'ol U.S. of A.. Everything is going great until against her recommendations (Jane) part of the wedding party (okay, Mark and Holly) partakes of some of the local raw shellfish and they find themselves laid low by food poisoning. Now Jane and Cal must ride to the rescue and pose as the \\"totally in love\\" couple in order to complete the paperwork needed in order for Mark and Holly to get married in Italy. What follows is Jane and Cal get a chance to know each other, and they both realize that the other is not a zany or bad as they thought. Could there be a happily ever after for these two?<br /><br />This was a fun read with plenty of laugh out loud moments. Ms. Cabot is one of my favorite authors in this new genre and her latest read is semi-autobiographical as this story is based on her own experience when she eloped to Italy with her husband. After all truth is stranger then fiction at times, and yes, great material for an entertaining read. This was a fast paced read that although it is a light hearted read she does tackle the hard issue of commitment phobic people, and the other issue of perceptions and how these can be hard as well. This is defiantly a character driven story and all four characters are endearing and likeable which only adds to the story. Ms. Cabot is an extremely talented and creative author and her latest effort is well worth picking up.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]of my favorite authors in this new genre and her latest read is semi-autobiographical as this story is based on her own experience when she eloped to Italy with her husband.

If you are a fan of this very talented author than make sure that you pick up her latest paranormal romance which finally showcases Derik Gardner of the Wyndham Werewolf's.  This story has been long awaited and she has finally come through for her fans!<br /><br />Derik has a problem.  He has just turned alpha which is a bad thing when there is someone in charge of the pack already, and that someone is his best friend Michael.  He has been scrapping it up and has come to realize that he may just have to move on, or face a fight to the death.  Not something that appeals since he would be fighting...Michael.  Well, he doesn't have to worry long, he has been given a mission of great importance.  He must find the re-incarnted Morgan Le Fey and kill her before she has a chance to destroy the world.  No problem.  He'll just hope into a convertible, and head out for sunny California.  Monterey, California to be exact.  Well, once he arrives he goes to 6 Fairy Tale Ln. but the woman he is suppose to kill is just too...ditzy, crazy...scatterbrained.  Oh, yeah...she's also real cute with that curly red hair.  Can he really kill her or can he re-work things and keep her for himself?  Something to think about...<br /><br />Sara Gunn has no idea who she is and why she has such incredible luck.  So she is of course surprised when a yummy...I mean yummy guy shows up at her house and then tries to kill her.  What on earth is going on?  Then he springs it on her that not only is he a werewolf, but she is really Morgan Le Fey.  Yeah right...all the time in her world.  Now she finds herself traveling across the country with Yummy man trying to come to grips with the fact that she now must kill Arthur's minions in order to save the world (yes, the storyline changes but that's part of the fun...trust me).  But can she and Derik find a happy ending as well?<br /><br />This was a very fast read with all of Ms. Davidson's trademark humor and wit.  Derik and Sara are great charecter's and the byplay is really part of the whole courtship.  This is one read that I highly recommend especially if you have been following the Wyndham Werewolf Tales.  If you are new to this series...fear not this is a stand alone read, that will only lead you to the others in the series.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]and the byplay is really part of the whole courtship.

This is one of the older titles that the very talented Ms. Evanovich penned back in the late '80's early '90's.  It showcases the incredible talent that she had in the making and has lived up to with her more recent stories.<br /><br />Daisy and Steve are great characters and oh...we can't forget Bob the dog.  Two more mis-matched people could not be found, yet they still manage to find common ground and develope a great relationship.  There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, and the romance between Steve and Daisy is fun.  If you are a fan to Ms. Evanovich and have not yet reader her earlier works I seriously recommend that you pick up this one.  It is not only a fast and entertaining read, but it is also fun.  This is a great way to spend a few hours.  What is better then laughing while falling in love?<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-11-10

Since I have not read the first in this series (Code Name: Nanny) I was not familiar with character's, nor did I come to this read with any specific expectations.  As a result I found this read to be fun with a unique storyline, and great characters that I enjoyed spending time with.<br /><br />Jess finds herself in the wrong place, at the wrong time, with what looks like to be the wrong guy.  And if this is not enough, she is in a situation of her own making. (I won't give this part away since it's a big part of the story)<br /><br />Hawk is on a mission and this Navy SEAL is tired, wet, and ready for bed.  What he is not ready for is finding a rather curvey singing off-key babe in his hotel bathroom.  Well, now he has to figure out the how, why, and what of his unexpected guest.  Of course this is going to be easier said then done, and when all is over, and explanations have been give, Jess and Hawk find themselves trapped in an elevator, and each learns a little bit more about the other.  This should be the end, but instead it's just the beginning.  Will they both survive to see the end of a very important mission?<br /><br />As I said previously, this was a fun story and one that I recommend if one is looking for a quick and easy read.  Hawk and Jess are not your average \\"romance characters\\" and as a result are fun.  Izzy from some of Ms. Skye's previous titles is here with a rather substantial roll, and it was fun to \\"see\\" him again.  If the reader is new to Ms. Skye this will not be an issue as Ms. Skye explains who he is.  Overall this was a read that I would recommend and suggest that you not overlook.<br /><br />Offical Reviewer for [...]	2004-11-09

But with that said, this is still a fun set of stories that for the most part will put the reader in the \\"holiday frame of mind\\" and will be entertaining enough to distract a person from long lines, and traffic.<br /><br />Donna Kauffman's story \\"Making Waves\\" is set in the tropical Atlantic.  Burke Morgan finally has his own yacht and is ready to take his first customer on there dream holiday cruise but first he has to replace his cook, and the replacement just so happens to get seasick when she stands on good ol' terrafirma.  Can Burke make Kamala's mind off her problem, and more on him?<br /><br />Nancy Warren's \\"Let It Snow\\" puts perky weathergirl Marisa Langley locked out on a snowy rooftop with her cameraman Rob Sheridon. Problem with this is Rob seems to hate Marisa...or does he?  Will they manage to keep each other warm on a snowy Christmas Eve?<br /><br />Erin McCarthy's \\"You, Actually\\" brings together two best friends that have not been quite honest with each other.  They both love the other, but have been to afraid to tell the truth.  Will the holiday spirit bring the two together?<br /><br />MaryJanice Davidson's \\"Undercover Claus\\" puts one workaholic cop who just so happens to be undercover as Santa.  Will ringing the bell in hopes of catching a thief but instead catches the eye of a rather yummy \\"Brit\\" instead.  Can these two different people find love during the holidays?<br /><br />Lucy Monroe's \\"Silver Bella\\" is the story of Bella, a model that may be sexy, but has no idea how to be \\"sexy\\".  That is until yummy Texan Jake Barton shows up and gives her just what she needs.<br /><br />Susanna Carr's \\"Snow Day\\" finds Karen alone and naked in the wrong bed.  Tyler thinks that everything is just as it should be on a snowy stormy Christmas.  Maybe he can show Karen that everything is right since it led her to him.<br /><br />Overall these are average stories.  This is probably due to the short length of each story and as a result these are not the full-fleshed out reads we are used too.  In any event they are all steamy, and offer rather yummy hero's and average heroines (a few were just too...obnoxious at times.) I would not rush out and pick up this book, but at the same time, I wouldn't avoid it either.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]not the full-fleshed out reads we are used too.

This was a fun and rather fresh addition to the genre of \\"Chick Lit\\" that I highly recommend if you are looking for a fast read that will have the reader laughing out loud, and playing arm chair investigator along side our funny but ditzy heroine Rebecca Fine.<br /><br />Rebecca Fine is a journalist and she is looking for that one article that will shoot her off into journalism stardom.  Problem is, she writes a beauty column and there just really isn't a huge chance of there being some dangerous and dastardly plot revolving around lip liner or lip-gloss.  On top of that she has just found out that her father has a new love interest that just so happens to have been her childhood nemesis \\"Lipstick\\" and said love interest is now (temporarily anyhow) going to be her roommate.  Oh, and yes and she just so happens to be embarking on a new relationship with Max Stoddart who has it all, looks, talent, and he just so happens to be working on a story that could make his total career.  Everything is going great in the romance department but the rest of her life has gone into the rubbish bin, or at least she thinks so until she gets a huge break with a possible scandal in the cosmetic industry that will lead her straight to Paris, and perhaps the Pulitzer...okay maybe that's asking too much, but still she now has a chance to prove that she does have what it takes to be great.  Now if she could only smooth out the bumps of her relationship with Max.  It looks like she has competition from another source, and Becks doesn't know exactly what to do now?  Should she trust him, or walk away and hope for better later?<br /><br />This was a fun story with great charismatic characters.  Becks is a times a little loopy and doesn't think things fully through before acting, but then again that's human nature at times.  Thankfully this is not a re-occurring theme with her behavior throughout the story. The relationship between Max and Rebecca is fun entertaining, but does not take front and center as far as the storyline goes.  In actuality there are several different sub-plots working at the same time with quite an eclectic cast of secondary characters, which keep this story from slowing down. The ending is fun with a satisfying conclusion for a storylines introduced.  This is the first time I've ever read Ms. Margolis and it honestly won't be the last.  For a fun light read I highly recommend this author.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]ront and center as far as the storyline goes.

I first read this book years ago when it first came out.  The story, characters, setting...every little thing stayed with me and as a result this book was placed on my keeper shelf.  Since the first reading I've moved from place to place, still re-packing this book without a second thought.  I found myself without reading material and I went to my book shelf and selected this one for a re-read...it had been so long since I had read it last that it was practically new to me.  As a result I was able to come back to Page and Iain and their romance was new, sweet, and quite the page-turner and thought to share my thoughts with fellow readers.<br /><br />This romance is sweet but at the same time has its sensual moments which is why this was such a great romance.  The characters are both owners of sore hearts, but for different reasons yet, despite this they find themselves drawn to each other regardless of the fact that they are suppose to be enemies.<br /><br />Iain is a strong male hero who is still tender, considerate, but at the same time he is the strong Scottish warrior that will do all that he has to in order to put an end to a traitor that would see him come to a horrid end.<br /><br />Page has been left unloved from the start.  Her father has no use for her, her mother joined a convent to get away from her, and her only friend is the daughter of her father's mistress.  She finds herself a prisoner of a \\"Scot\\" and the person that should be mean and nasty to her just so happens to be the first person in her life to treat her with kindness, and as a result she finds herself being pulled into two different directions.  Is it truly possible that the strong, handsome Scot thinks that she's pretty, and that he wants her, or is it all a cruel jest?<br /><br />Both of these characters are strong, and truly will stay with the reader long after the book comes to an end.  This was a sweet romance that allows the reader deep inside the heads of the characters so hopefully the reader will understand the push and pull of this dynamic relationship.  The storyline is a gently paced but still moves along fast enough to keep the reader engaged.  This is a fine Scottish historical romance that I feel is truly a classic in every sense of the word.  I highly recommend this author and any of her past titles as a fine way to pass the time.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]opefully the reader will understand the push and pull of this dynamic relationship.

The lastest insallment of Ms. Lee's \\"Sexy\\" series is just as much fun if not more than the first.  This is Chloe's story and she has finally met her match when she tangles with corporate raider Sterling Prescot.  They literally run into each other on the first meeting and the sparks fly.  She dosen't know who he is and he has no idea who she is.  Their worlds are about to collide again in a professional manner, and sweet, simple, and sensible Chloe takes a backseat to sexy, minx Chloe.<br /><br />Sterling has come to El Paso for one reason and one reason only.  Take over KTEX T.V. and get back home with his brother Ben before the ink drys on the sales agreement.  Well, so much for best laid plans.  Before he knows it he has been crashed into by a sexy little lady who wants him to kiss her just because.  She has no idea who he is and that's a turn on for him.  This should not be a problem except for the fact that she ran out on him when the kiss was just starting to get interesting, and she has now shown up in a meeting regarding the struggling station.  Before he knows it, his plans have changed from buying the station to helping the station.  That's not all he is about to star as \\"the catch\\" for a reality T.V. show and he wants Chloe to be one of \\"the roses\\".  Why is this important you ask?  Well, because Chloe is turning out to have an amazing affect on him, and he wants to win her for himself.  Now he just needs to prove to Chloe that he's there for the long haul.<br /><br />This was a great story.  Ms. Lee's take on today's rage of reality T.V. is great.  Old friends make a return and the chemistry between Chloe and Sterling is great.  It's worth it in the end when they finally get together.  This story also offered a great sneak peek at Julia's story regarding Sterling's brother Ben.  I can't wait for the next and final book in the series.

This read has some great authors contributing to it (Nancy Warren, MaryJanice Davidson, and Karen Kelley) so you know that you're in for a treat.  I won't go into a long drawn out synopsis of each short story, suffice to say that all three authors manage to deliver fun reads that will have the reader laughing out loud and sighing \\"Ah romance\\".

Tripp was a great character and I would have liked to see him and his relationship with Glory more fleshed out...still this was a great amazing read that you won't want to miss.<br /><br />Glory owns and runs her own sandwich store.  The fact that she has the worlds worst record with men, and the fact that her parents worry about this keep her from being over the trees happy.  That and the fact that Tripp Shaughnessey has set her on fire with no chance of having that fire extinguished anytime soon doesn't help.  At least that's what it looks until he shows up in her storeroom and lays a kiss on her nearly takes the roof off.  Then everything comes apart, and her store is being held hostage, and Glory finds out that Tripp may be a little more then he seems.<br /><br />This was a great read.  The chemistry between Tripp and Glory is beyond hot, and Ms. Kent manages to package a lot into a little bit.  This is a great edition to her new series and I look forward to the next.  I only hope that it's more then 117 pages long.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-11-01

Ms. Grasso's latest offering is wonderful and magical.  This was a fast-paced read that brought back many old favorite friends, plus introduced us to not only a new couple, but a new set of friends that will live with the reader long after the final page is read.<br /><br />Russian Princess Amber Kazanov is forced to leave her native homeland of Russia in search of what she was never able to find there.  Love, family and most importantly exceptance.  Her journey is forced by her nasty uncle and his rather horrid plans for her.  She heads for her cousin Rudolf's knowing that he will help her.  He does, he introduces Amber to Miles Montgomery a good friend but a man that has scars that are not just on the outside but on the inside as well.  He hopes that these two lost souls can help each other find what they are looking for.<br /><br />Miles has suffered a great loss that of his wife and unborn child in a fire that left his face scared and his heart scared as well.  He lives in seclusion on on Stratford estate going no where and seeing few.  He is shocked when his friend Rudolf brings Amber to him and asks him to marry her.  He can't bring himself to care for another living soul and to loose that person.  He will keep Amber safe but at arms distance.  He can't and won't risk his heart again.  Problem is...Amber wakes things he thought burn to ashes along with the rest of his life.  She is everything that he needs and she grows more important to him then anything.  Even his self-imposed isolation.<br /><br />This was a very emotional read.  Readers may be put off by Miles in the beginning, but he is a worthy hero and one that readers should have patience with.  Amber is a great complement to Miles dark brooding self.  Together they are a couple that will stay and charm the reader.  I highly recommend this read and I look forward to the next of Ms. Grasso's wonderful reads.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-11-01

Ms. McKade is known for her historical westerns and these are reads that I have gobbled up in the past.  She has now taken a shot at the sub genre romantic suspense and she has nailed it!!<br /><br />This story has it all...fast paced suspense, great characters, and great chemstry between Danni(our heroine) and Nick (our YUMMY hero).<br /><br />Danni has just buried her father Paddy.  Their relationship has been bad and now they will never have the chance to make things right.  She is doing the best she can to get on with life when Nick Sirocco comes in and shakes her foundation by claiming he things her father was murdered rather then having killed himself.<br /><br />Nick was close to Paddy.  Paddy helped to turn his life around and he was the father that he never had.  He can't believe that he would kill himself and he is going to prove it.  Now he just needs a little help so he contacts Danni.  Danni is everything he knew she would be.  Tough, strong-willed, and beautiful.  The promise of beauty as a child came true.  Now the two of them are investigating a murder and having to stay close to each other since the killer is now after them.  They don't know who to trust.  Could the killer be a policeman?<br /><br />This was a very fast paced read.  The storyline although not \\"new\\" was done in such a way that it was fresh and kept the reader engaged.  The chemistry between Nick and Danni was great.  There was a true push and pull that added not only to the growing relationship, but also played a large part with the plot.

This book was great, think \\"Northern Exposure\\" meets Nora Roberts and voila fun reading.  Why not a higher rating than?  The answer is simple.  Meg our heroine left me as cold as an Alaskan winter night.  Yup, that's right our heroine is about as unlikeable as she could be.  Standoffish, stubborn, and willfull, and those are her good qualities.  The rest of the town members are great, mayor Hopp, Peach, Charlene...you get the picture, and you will fall in love a little with Nate.  All of these characters are the saving graces of the story.<br /><br />Storyline is a combination of suspense/contemporary and is a moderate page turner.  The reader is led through the murder through a series of journal enteries that paint very vivid pictures for the reader.  We are then taken back to present time and are treated to \\"a day in the life of Lunacy\\" as Nate uncovers secrets that have long been buried under the Alasken ice.  At the same time Nate feels the draw of Meg, and their relationship is a pull and tug that they both fight against but eventually can't turn away from.  Will their love be strong enough to see them through the upcoming investigation?<br /><br />As I said at the beginning of this review the story was good but Meg kept it from being great.  Ms. Roberts seems to be trying to pull away from her trademark way of telling a story to a more mainstream feel but this did not work for this read.  That is not to say that Ms. Roberts should not grow as a story teller, but she should have paid more attention to characterization.  Bottom line this is a good book, but I would not rush out and buy it in hardback form.  Wait for the paperback, or borrow it from a friend.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-10-28

The idea of using a \\"gossip column\\" to further a storyline is not a new one and Ms. Grey had fun with this aspect of the story.  The problem that I had with the story was the storyline regarding Catherine (our heroine) and her search for her father.  This story had great potential and did bring Catherine and John together but then fell flat and the outcome was less then satisfactory.  This was truly the only part of the story that was a let down and the characters and the chemistry between the two was nice.<br /><br />Secondary characters add to the telling of the story and I look forward to reading Lord Dugdale's story and recommend this one as a nice way to spend an evening.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-10-28

Western historicals seem to be making a comeback and this story is a perfect addition to the genre.  This is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Templeton and I look forward to reading stories by her in the future.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-10-28

As a result I found her latest effort to be not only a fun read, but thought her take on the legend of Arthur and Merlin to be not only different but also creative.<br /><br />This paranormal read offers it all, Vampires, fairies, new worlds, and even a hit of reality.  Combined a yummy dark hero, and a strong no nonsense heroine and you have a read that will make you laugh out loud at times, and sigh as well.  Ms. Knight has penned a very sensual read so the reader should be prepared for this when they open the pages of the book.  This is not to say that it's over the top, but it is steamier than your average romance read.<br /><br />Ms. Knight is a very talented author and one that I highly recommend.  Her reads are fast-paced, sensual, with enough action and suspense (in this case can Reece and Erin save the world from a destructive demon bent on bring the end of mankind) to keep the reader turning the pages until the end.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-10-25

Ms. Marek has penned a very emotional novel, which is about change and the various ways we all deal with important issues.  This is a character driven read and with several different characters vying to tell their own story you would think that the reader would get a little lost.  The fact of the matter is Ms. Marek manages to weave several different plots together seamlessly and by doing so tells a story that is both disturbing and moving.<br /><br />Psychologist Abby Cohen has lost her daughter to illness.  She has been having a hard time dealing with her sorrow and as a result her relationship with her husband Michael, and her relationship with her four-year-old son is falling apart.  She wants to feel again but is unsure how to go about doing this.  That is until twelve-year-old Miranda is brought to her hospital.  Miranda seems detached and mute.  She responds to no one until she sees Abby.  Abby is drawn to Miranda but in order to help unravel Miranda's past and treat her, she must look inside herself to see what truly lays behind the calm smiles.  What she finds is she has the ability to love after all despite all that she has lost.<br /><br />This is really not a \\"romance novel\\" in the literal sense.  This is truly a mainstream novel that will appeal to all readers.  Ms. Marek touches on all sorts of topics ranging from the loss of a child, how to keep a child safe from harm but still allowing them to live, and what love truly is.  Abby, Miranda, Jack and Michael are all strong characters and they each bring something important to the story.  This is the strong debut effort from Ms. Marek and I think that she will be a great asset to woman's fiction in the future.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-10-25

Fan's of the very talented author Emma Holly are going to be very happy with her latest erotic paranormal read. Ms. Holly has delivered us another creative world in which nothing is as it seems and where nothing is worth having without taking a little risk. Combine compelling charcters that are not \\"perfect\\", a fast moving storyline, steamy attraction between our main characters, and voila pure entertainment.<br /><br />Of course those that are new to Ms. Holly should be warned that her love sense are \\"HOT\\" to say the least and are not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />The reader will step into the Victorian like city of Avvar were humans and demons live side by side, and where it's dangerous to find the two mixing. Or at least it should not mix but Roxanne McAllister just so happens to be an outcast in this city who shares genes from her human mother and her demon father. As if this is not bad enough she finds herself drawn to her injured guest Inspector Adrian Phillips. What starts off as a brewing mutual attraction turns into a searing relationship that is doomed from the start. These two should not be together. Ever.<br /><br />Adrian knows that he can't share his life with Roxanne, but one week under her care has changed him forever. When he finds out about her heritage he knows that he must end things with her quick and clean. Easier said then done and he finds himself crossing a line that could put everything they feel and share at risk.<br /><br />Again this was a great story for fans of the paranormal genre. The characters are truly multi-dimensional and as a result the reader can't help but feel for them. Love scenes are hot and explicit in true \\"Emma Holly Fashion\\", but it only adds to the telling of the story. Ms. Holly has truly created a very interesting world in which a reader can loose themselves if for only just a little while.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-10-24

Suffice to say this was a rather steamy western that I truly enjoyed due to the fact that there really aren't a whole lot of good western romances out there anymore and this fit the bill.<br /><br />The characters of this story were...different to say the least.  We have a strong male lead with William Donovan, our heroine Viola Ross was probably the weakest part of the story but still redemable since she found William worth loving despite his humble beginnings (she comes from wealth and high standing back east), and what story would be complete without \\"evil bad guy\\" in the form of Paul Lennox.  The fact that Lennox owns more then half of the small Arizona town of Rio Piedras and decides that Viola needs to be his wife seems to be the main storyline rather then the secondary as I think the author was counting on.  The relationship between Viola and William was good, but could have been fleshed out more, and truly had more pontential then I think Ms. Whiteside gave it. There was the sideline story regarding Viola's brother and his search for her and this was truly a letdown since the storyline was introduced then dropped within a few pages to be totally forgotten until the final chapter.<br /><br />Despite the things that I mentioned I felt were lacking, I still found this to be an entertaining read. The tension of just how far the bad guy would go, not to mention the chemistry between William and Viola saved this read from being tedious in the extreme.  Fans of the western romance genre should be appeased by this latest offering by Ms. Whiteside, and I look forward to her next effort.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-10-23

So seldom do I start a series from the very fist story so when I found out Ms. Kent had a new book out, and it was the first of several stories to come, needless to say I raced out and ordered it.  You can always be guaranteed a good read when you pick up Ms. Kent and this story was no exception.<br /><br />Without going into a long drawn out synopsis (this could give some things away the reader would probably rather I didn't) suffice to say that this is a very fast-paced, emotional read that will have you glued to the pages until the final chapter.<br /><br />Well, what's so great you ask?  This book offers it all, a great storyline, a hero that is not only damaged, but willing to have his heart healed by a truly remarkable heroine (in this case Natasha) and it offers enough teasers of upcoming characters that you will be hooked and out pre-ordering the rest in the series.  Chemistry between Christian and Natasha is great, and there is enough push and pull between the two to keep the reader satisfied that yes, they will get their happy ending, but it won't come easy.<br /><br />I greatly look forward to the next in the series which will be \\"The Shaughnessey Accord\\" and hope that Christian and Natasha will be around for that one.  It was hard to see this story come to an end, and I plan on finding room on my keeper shelf.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-10-23

This one was a decent read but didn't make it onto my keeper shelf.<br /><br />I had a rather difficult time getting into the story.  Ms. Holt had all the makings of a great story, wounded war hero needing space, time, and attention to heal, no-nonsense heroine in order to see her hero on the mend.  Problem was I found our hero Captain Stephen Chamberlin to be more then a little spoiled and Mrs. Anne Smythe a little less then...inspiring.  Yes, their relationship does eventually take off, and there is plenty of Ms. Holt's trademark sensuality to be found within the pages.  At the same time the storyline did improve but there were several pages, and chapters that had to be slogged through in order to accomplish this.  I only did so because I truly enjoy this authors talent and had been looking forward too one of her reads.  The book was worth finishing it just did not leave me thinking about our newfound friends after the final page was read.<br /><br />Again I won't say that this was a great book, but in the same breath it's not horrid either. If you are a constant reader (as I am) of Ms. Holt you may find this read a little less than inspired.  If you are a newcomer to Ms. Holt, I highly recommend you picking up one of her later titles as well as this title in order to see what she is truly capable of.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-10-19

Ms. Lee has penned a very witty, and fun contemporary romance that combines great characters, laughter, and of course romance.<br /><br />Katherine, \\"Katie\\" Bloom is trying to re-invent herself.  Problem is she is not sure how to go from prim and proper, stuffed shirt news anchor, to fun and flighty news anchor.  Her friends (it doesn't hurt that they are also co-workers and boss) think that they have the answer with \\"Getting Real With Kate\\" a news segment that is suppose to bring Kate down to her viewers.  Well, needless to say Kate is totally ambivalent since her first segment is supposed to include a naked chef (yes, I did say naked) and Kate has enough problems with the kitchen let alone a naked chef to boot.  Now said chef is late, and in walks the love of her life (since she was four) looking much too yummy for words.  The fact that she has made a cake of herself with Jesse Chapman more then once is just a little too much even for prim Kate.  Before she knows it though Jesse has found a place to stay in her guesthouse, and all of the feelings she though she had buried for him have well, lets just say managed to find the light of day...again!  What's a girl to do?<br /><br />Jesse Chapman has returned to El Paso, Texas to get out of the limelight and reporters after his historic rescue of a golf fan during one of his matches.  Jesse can play golf like no ones business and he has got the PGA coming up so it only makes sense to get his act together and his game back where it all started...at home.  But this means seeing Katie again.  The one woman that he has always wanted, but felt he could never have...never and now Katie has finally grown up and is more of a temptation then ever before.  Will he be able to walk away from her when the time comes?<br /><br />This was a great read.  Katie and Jesse are dynamic characters that truly come to life for the reader.  Add Chloe, Julia, and Travis and you have a great cast of characters that will stay with the reader long after the final pages have been read.  I highly look forward to the rest of the series, and suggest that if you love laughter with your romance that you not overlook Ms. Lee.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]<br /><br />.er long after the final pages have been read.

This is the first time I've read Ms. Burton and this read was not only fast (172 pages) it was fun and a great escape and one that I highly recommend if you like very intense sensuality in your reads.  If not you may want to avoid this book since Ms. Burton puts the \\"H\\" in hot.<br /><br />I won't go into a deep synopsis of this read but basically one of the things that I liked about the read was the growth of the characters.  Serena comes to the island unsure about herself sexually, but willing to learn about herself, and Michael is just the opposite, he knows what he likes, what he dosen't and is a bit jaded.  Still, he sees the good things in Serena, and since she is a bit naive but this is just what Michael needs in order to find love again.<br /><br />As I stated at the beginning of the review this was a fast, sensual read that I enjoyed.  The storyline although a bit contrived still worked and perhaps helped to create the \\"fantasy island\\" where anything can happen.  Ms. Burton is an author that I think we should watch.  She can only get better.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-10-16

Ms. McCarthy has now been added to my \\"must purchase\\" list of authors.  Her latest effort \\"Houston We Have A Problem\\" is not only witty and fun, but it also touches on some very basic human issues that although not talked about or excepted are still things we in society deal with.  What could that be you ask?  Well, how about overweight female doctor with little confidence in herself, and yummy guy doctor oozing confidence but finding overweight doctor unbelievable!<br /><br />Josie is a perky, talkative, wanna be surgeon (well, at least she thinks she wants to be a surgeon) but she has one very big problem.  She turns into the world biggest klutz the second Dr. Houston Hayes is ANYWHERE near her.  Dr. Hayes is her every dream come true and the chances of her finding happiness with him are about as great as Duran Duran's John Taylor falling at her feet.  Well, that's not about to happen or is it?<br /><br />Houston has had a hard life.  His father was an abusive man and he will do all that he can to avoid becoming his dad.  If that means keeping a distance from any female that even looks like she's on the hunt for a husband, then he is miles away from that she-wolf.  That is until Josie bends over in front of him to retreive a dropped X-ray.  Now all bets are off, and Houston now needs to keep telling himself there is no way he can be attracted to the chatty doctor with the oh-so sexy curves.  Still despite all of the reason's why he should avoid her he can't and this sets him on a rollercoaster ride where they only thing at stake could be he finally looses his heart.<br /><br />I loved this book!  I loved the fact that Josie was not perfect, and that yummy man did not give a darn.  I loved the fact that although Houston came off tough and strong, he still had is own issues that made him real and even likeable (even when he was being a bit of twit!).  Josie was great.  She had the obvious hang ups women with extra curves has.  Still she is willing to take the chance on Houston and find the beauty he sees in her herself.  It goes without say that this book is a steamy read, but it only adds to the story of these two wounded people.  I find Ms. McCarthy's writing style to be highly entertaining when one considers her character development, as well as swift moving plot.

Ms. Roberts is off to a great start with her latest \\"Garden Series\\" with the first of the books being \\"Blue Dahlia\\". This read offers the fan of the paranormal romance genre everything that Ms. Roberts is known for. Tears, Laughter, and a great cast of characters that tell their own story. Major and secondary characters are all important to the telling of this story and are not used as filler.<br /><br />Sella Rothchild thinks that she has lost everything when her husband dies and leaves her a widow with two small boys to raise. What she needs is a change. A change comes with the chance of moving back to southern Tennessee in order to manage a plant nursery. She is going to work for Roz Harper and help her organize her already successful operation. One catch, she must live at Harper House, a wonderful old plantation manor that just so happens to have it's very own resident ghost. Oh, and one member of the staff does not want to be organized. This of course would Logan Kiteridge. Could a man be more madding???<br /><br />It's not long before Stella is butting heads with garden designer Logan Kitridge and the sparks that fly from the first meeting only get brighter with each meeting there after. Soon Stella is florishing in her new situation, and she is even allowing her heart to open again to a new man, but someone on the plantation is not happy about it. Does Logan and Stella have half a chance at finding happiness that they both want, or will someone ruin their relationship before it even gets off the ground?<br /><br />This was a fast-paced read that had this reader glued to the pages until the very end. Stella and Logan are a great couple, and the sparks they set off each other are fun to read about. As per normal when reading a Nora Robert book you will find both laughter and tears which is probably why she is a NY Times Bestselling author.

The relationship between Lauren and Nick is not only hot and sensual, but it is also a relationship that brings change for the better in both characters personal lives.<br /><br />Lauren is not like her fun loving party hard girlfriend Carolyn.  In fact she can't be more opposite.  This is not to say she is the \\"ice princess\\" everyone calls her. She does have a sensual side that she keeps hidden within the pages of a red diary that only she knows about.  Here she feels safe to let her sensual self loose and engage in wonderfully sexy fantasies that always end with a sense of peace and well-being as well with the emotion of love being felt.  Her privacy though is about to be invaded by her contracted house painter.  She doesn't want to be attracted to Nick but she can't help feel the pull of their mutal attraction.<br /><br />Nick has long hated Lauren's dad.  His life has been hard and he blames whether right or wrong, Lauren's dad.  He takes the contract to paint her house as a way of looking into a life that should have been his.  He stumbles across her diary and reads a fantasy out of it.  He can't believe that the \\"ice princess\\" has such a hot imagination, nor can he believe that it speaks to him.  He thinks the best way to get his revenge is to act out a few of her fantasies, and then let her know he \\"knows\\" her secret.  Problem with this plan though is he starts to get to know Lauren, and the searing sensuality of their relationship stays with him long after he has left her.  Before he knows it he is sharing himself with her, and learning that Lauren is not all that he thought she was.  In fact she is just the opposite, she fun loving, caring, friendly, and loyal.  She is everything he thinks he dosen't deserve but wants, even if it means risking it all by telling her the truth.  Will Lauren and Nick be able to save a relationship that neither was looking for but on that has become so important to them?<br /><br />This was an incredible read!  Nick and Lauren both grow and change over the course of the story and as a result their love is all the more sensual and sweet.  Secondary characters such as Davy and Elaine are wonderful additions to this story and are important for the reader to understand Nick.  Nick has a lot of baggage and the fact that he allows his heart to be opened by Lauren is amazing.  Ms. Blake has penned a very sensual story but the sensuality is very key to the storyline.  It is in no way filler and perhaps is as sensual as it is due to the relationship of Nick and Lauren themselves.

To be honest I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to this genre.  Why do you ask?  Well, because although this is a popular genre at times the fare is less then appealing.  Ms. Burbank's story is the exception to the rule, and if you like me are picky about the author that you choose to read then fear not Ms. Burbank's story is amazing and well worth picking up.<br /><br />This is the first in a vampire series and it opens with the \\"birth\\" of Mordred Soulis.  This story is about his education and the beginning of his long and arduous journey to his destiny.  Along the way he meets several who will help him on his journey, and one that he must at all cost fight off in order not to fall to the darkness.  Vlad is out to cause Mordred his fall but Mordred still has his soul and he is stronger then he actually thinks he is but he has much to learn if he is to finally be a champion of the human race.<br /><br />Mordred Soulis is a half-born vampire that is both immortal and mortal at the same time.  He is \\"the chosen one\\" and he has a long road to walk before he will learn all that he needs to know in order to save the world.  His beginning is hard and the mystery of his existence is one that he must work out on his journey.  Eventually with the company of a shape-shifting companion Mordred sets off through many different and exotic places learning what he needs to know in his \\"infancy\\" in order fulfill his destiny.<br /><br />This was an incredible read, and Mordred is a multi-dimensional character that was highly entertaining.  Ms. Burbank is a very descriptive storyteller and her words will draw you into her world, and you will feel, see, and yes smell everything that Mordred does. One of the added benefits of this tale is the fact that the author took great care in her research, and as a result has crafted a vampire tale unlike any I've ever read.  I can hardly wait for the continuation of this story and I highly recommend that if you are a fan of Vampire fiction you not miss out on this page turning read.highly recommend that if you are a fan of Vampire fiction you not miss out on this page turning read.   <br />	2004-10-06

I won't go and say I've been a huge fan of Kathleen Woodiwiss but I have enjoyed several of her books.  I too question whether the same person that was capable of penning \\"Shanna\\" was responsible for this effort.  Thankfully I waited until it came out in paperback instead of shelling out more money for the hardback.<br /><br />What are the problems you ask?  Well, the prose is thick and overblown as other reviewers have already stated.  Characters.  What can we say about the characters that hasn't already been said?  They are unlike able and totally taken with superficial things.  This book is one of the reasons romance gets such a bad rap. Nothing but nothing was redeemable about this read.<br /><br />I agree with many of the reviewers that reading the reviews was more entertaining then reading the book.  It also pains me to pan a novel.  It takes great time and effort to get a story down and to bring charaters alive, characters that the reader will care about.  I don't think this is so much Ms. Woodiwiss's fault as so much as the editor.  Throwing a book together and then adding a well-known authors name on the cover may sell some copies, but word will get around if the book is not up to the standards that a true fan will expect.  I hate to compare but this book is NOTHING like what she is capable of and I can only hope her next effort will be better then the past three.	2004-10-03

I can actually say that I buy Lori Foster books just because her name is on the cover.  I don't care about the story or the series I know it's going to be good.  Well, it goes without say that Ms. Foster's latest is GREAT, IT ROCKS, IT'S FUN!!!<br /><br />Clint is tall, big, dangerous, and violence makes him sick to his stomach.  Literally!  So why is Julie Rose attracted to him after he saves her and then goes and throws up in the bushes?  Because he makes her feel safe and she trusts him of course.<br /><br />Julie Rose has been kidnapped and her ex-fiance hires Clint to bring her back.  She is holding her own but is ever so glad to see Clint, Red, and Mojo coming to save the day.  After the rescue Clint must now unravel who is behind the kidnapping and keep Julie safe from the person that she has trusted is going to be hard.  Is it the ex-fiance or someone else close to Julie that put her in danger?<br /><br />What should have been an easy rescue turns out to cost Clint more then he ever thought it would.  He's tough and he is doing the \\"rescue thing\\" only as long as it takes to build up his savings account and they he's outta there.  When he sets eyes on Julie Rose for the first time he knows that this is not going to be an easy case.  Granted she's no raving beauty, but he can't seem to keep his hands, and mind off of her.  Now he needs to keep her safe and his well ordered way of thinking is suffering.  Will he be able to keep her safe, or will someone finally take away from him the one things he never thought he needed?<br /><br />This was a great book.  The chemistry between Clint and Julie Rose is wonderful.  When two such very different people mix you can expect explosive heat!  Julie Rose is a fun character, who is both sassy, and smart.  She's also a soft heart and it's exactly what Clint needs.  Clint is also a perfect match for her.  All of our old favorites come back.  Shay, Joe, Jamie, and Scott.  We also get to meet some new friends.  If you have been following this story since the beginning with \\"Say No To Joe?\\" then you won't want to miss this addition.  But, if you're new to this series this is a strong stand alone read!  For a wonderful fun and romantic way to spend your time you can't beat Ms. Foster.

Ms. Wine has managed to produce a strong paranormal romantic suspense read for her debut.  The storyline is very much character driven and as a result we learned a lot about our hero Brice and our heroine Grace.<br /><br />I will admit to a few moments of confusion at the beginning of the read when we are initially learning about Grace and her psychic powers.  She has been called in to rescue a missing child.  She is successful but \\"senses\\" another child that has been taken.  This secondary plot was weak and in the end we find out who the bad guy is without following up on the abuction of the second child.<br /><br />As I stated at the beginning of the review overall this was a strong read for a debut effort but it did have it's problem spots.  Brice and Grace are strong main characters and their growing attraction is steamy to say the least.  This title would fall under the sub-genre romantica.  This means that there tends to be a little more steam with the romance, but it's not filler and it's done tastefully.  This is an author that I would recommend to any fan of the romance genre.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-09-26

I have been a fan of this awesome author after reading her for the first time when I read \\"Harvest\\", and I have consumed all of her other efforts greedily.  I was thrilled to find out she had a new title available with two of my favorite characters (Dr. Isles and Jane Rizzoli) and quickly made my purchase when it was available.  Sadly, although this story had great potential, I felt a little cheated by not only the path that this story took but also rather let down in the ending.<br /><br />Without going into plot (I feel that too much could be given away that has not already been covered in previous reviews) the chance we had at getting to know Maura better (family issues) was not realized, and the growing attraction between Daniel Brophy (we met him in a previous novel) was re-introduced and then abruptly left without so much as an understanding why it was introduced to begin with.  Perhaps this interesting relationship will finally be resolved in a later effort but as far as this read went it derailed more then intrigued.<br /><br />This is not to say that this novel is not worth picking up.  It is just don't expect to be \\"blown away\\" as this book is really less then what Ms. Gerritsen has provided readers in the past.<br /><br />Ms. Gerritsen tried to prove that even the most strange circumstances can make for an entertaining read. Unfortunatly there were so many twist and turns (too many really) that one plot ended up derailing the secondary plot, and then I was left wondering \\"what is she trying to do?\\"  Plenty of descriptive passages puts the reader right in the middle of things but this could be a bad thing if the reader tends to be squimish.  Ms. Gerritsen is an author that I highly recommend but this read is one that I would say had great potential but never fully engaged this reader as her past efforts have.  This book was worth finishing but I admit that I was glad to see the end and I was not truly satisfied with how things were wrapped up.  Perhaps we are in for a new chapter with Maura and Jane.  One can only hope, since this ending left much to be desired.rhaps we are in for a new chapter with Maura and Jane.  One can only hope, since this ending left much to be desired.	2004-09-25

As a result she has given us another great read that is short and to the point but has great characterization and a fast moving plot that will have readers turning the pages.<br /><br />The suspense portion of this read is great.  You are really left to guessing who the killer is out of a cast of several likely suspects.  There are enough red herrings thrown out that you are truly left guessing until the final pages.  The chemistry between our main characters is great and the fact that they have a past relationship actually only addes to the the push and pull of their new and growing attraction.<br /><br />This was a first class read by a great author whom I pick up simply because her name graces the cover.

Add to that a twin sister that may or may not be all that she appears to be and a new admire that doesn't have good intentions and you have the makings of a great page turning read.<br /><br />This was the first time I've ever read Hunter Morgan and I must admit to being impressed.

Her stories are witty and fun but at the same time manage to touch on emotions and yes, sometimes even topics that are sometimes left alone.<br /><br />Her latest effort is a must read as far as I'm concerned.  The story is character driven and as a result the reader becomes totally envolved with both main and secondary characters.  This is the second book in the \\"Glass Slipper\\" series but if you missed the first \\"The Cinderella Rules\\" fear not, this read is a strong stand alone read.<br /><br />Valerie Wagner knows that she is destined to have a sucessful career in the fashion industry.  Problem is the fashion industry is not aware of this.  Well, her ship has come in, in the form of publicist for the new up-and coming Glass Slipper magazine!  She has managed to land for their very first cover the one and only \\"Dear Prince Charming\\" who is a wildly popular advise columnist, that is not only handsome, but he understands women!  Everything is set to go and Prince Charming does something that is totally not prince like.  Valerie now has to scamble to not only save her brilliant career but also the bacon of Prince Charming.  What's a girl to do?<br /><br />Jack Lambert is handsome, reasonably sucessful as an alternative sports writer, and the best friend of Eric aka Prince Charming.  The one thing that Jack is not is a prince.  Just look at his track record with past relationships!  Eric askes him to pose as the \\"face\\" of PC and Jack will do anything for Eric after all he saved his life more then once, that is until he takes a look at Valerie.  Could she be more uptight, and what's up with his growing attraction for her?  She is so not what he normally goes for.  Trouble is, she gets to him, and he understands that her job is just as important to her as his friendship with Eric.  But can he pull this scam off without risking everything, including his heart?<br /><br />This was a fun fast-paced read that I highly enjoyed.  This story is truly more of the \\"Chick-Lit\\" genre then full out romance I think.  Valerie, Jack, Eric and the Godmothers are wonderful characters and the reader will not be able to fall a little in love with the whole cast! If books that combine love and laughter are your choice of reading material you will love this book.  I'm looking forward to Ms. Kauffman's next effort with great anticipation!more of the \\"Chick-Lit\\" genre then full out romance I think.

I have been a long time fan of Ms. McKade and I'm so thrilled that she is finally back writing another of her great western historical romances.<br /><br />Emma Hartwell had been captured by a tribe of the Lakota Sioux.  She lives with the People for seven years and becomes a member of their society.  But soon she is rescued by the U.S. Cavalry and taken back to her old family.  This is not something that she wants and she soon finds it hard to live among the shallow minded members of the town she had grown up with and lived with for fifteen years.  Even her parents treat her differently and without any thought to her feelings they plan on sending her to her Aunt's house.  As if this is not problem enough she has been having nightmares that she knows are really visions telling her that her that she has unfinished business with her adopted family.  Emma has a secret.

By page 100 I was fed up with that whole storyline and felt that it was taking away too much from the main plot which was Jack and Kelley finding love again.<br /><br />This is not to say that the story was not good, and Ms. Heath's debut contemporary was mildly entertaining once you got past the whole teenage angst issue.  Jack was a great hero with plenty of patience for both ladies in his life.<br /><br />Ms. Heath is a very talented author and one that I would highly recommend to the romance reader.

Ms. Howard goes back to her espionage storyline with her latest effort.  We were first introduced to this type of story with \\"All The Queens Men\\" which, was really not one of her best either.  Now in \\"Kiss Me While I Sleep\\" we are thrown back into the spy thriller that truly lacks any thrill for the reader.<br /><br />Ms. Howard seems to be trying to make the jump into mainstream fiction which is fine, but at the same time she seems to want to stay with her romance roots.  Again this is okay but a balance must be found which I will admit is probably easier said then done.  For the most part both main characters are cold...well, they are assasins but then we are led on a sad path where Lily has lost a set of friends which pushes her to the edge and takes matters into her own hands.  Now she has gone rogue and the CIA sends in Lucas Swain into the fray in order to pull her back.  What follows is a confusing relationship where Lucas is lying to Lily for the ENTIRE story and Lily is unsure whether to trust Lucas but yet they build a relationship?  Based on what???<br /><br />This story was hard to get into and it never grabbed me as a reader.  The characters were cold and unfeeling for the most part, and the storyline was convoluted to say the least.  This was a hard review to write since I have been a long time fan of Ms. Howard but, the sad fact of the matter is she was off her game with this book.

If this means hardback, well then so be it.  I find that as an author she has grown since her historical writing days and in my opinion she has improved!  This was a well written book with plenty of twist and turns and a few sideline plots.  Some authors are not able to fully juggle more then one storyline without letting one suffer.  Ms. Garwood is true to all storylines introduced and the fact that they are interwoven into the main plot helps a great deal.<br /><br />As you have probably already read this is Alec Buchanan's story.  He is the brother of Theo and Nick Buchanan whom we have already met in \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Mercy\\" and Alec is a great hero who is not \\"perfect\\" in form but handsome and sexy in his own right.  He is police detective that has decided to move forward in his career which, means taking a job with the F.B.I..  Before he can do this though he must finish the case that he is currently working which involves bodyguard duty for beautiful Regan Hamilton Madison.  She has gotten herself involved in a murder and the killer is playing a cat and mouse game with no one knowing what the rules are, and who the main victim should be...that is until the wrong man is arrested and everyone lets their guards down.<br /><br />Regan is the youngest of four kids and is the only girl.  Her brothers have been taking care of her since she was a small child and as a result it's safe to say that she has lived a rather sheltered life.  Her life though is about to change when her friends Sophie and Cordie decide to investigate a man they think is responsible for the death of a woman whom he has bilked millions from.  They want justice and they attend one of his seminars to see if they can learn anything.  During the seminar they are take part in a lesson that will have deadly results.  Now Regan finds herself being protected by one sexy cop and her attraction for him is becoming harder and harder to fight.  She just wishes that the feelings were returned.  Or maybe they are.  Can Regan and Alec find love while trying to stay two steps ahead of a killer?<br /><br />This was a very fast read.  The suspense is carefully built into the storyline with no lagging or letdown.  Same is true for the attraction that is between Alec and Regan.  Again Ms. Garwood seems to be moving into the more mainstream novels and as a result the romance level is a little less then readers of her older stories are used to.  This is not a bad thing just something you should be aware of if you are looking for a more intense romance.  Ms. Garwood introduces the reader to some new and fun characters as well as bringing back old favorites.  Yes, Noah does make a small showing.  Key word small.  Still the romance between Alec and Regan is well done and the time that Ms. Garwood takes to develop their relationship is worth it in the end.  This is one novel that I have no problems recommending, and I think that the reader, if they come to the book with an open mind will enjoy it greatly.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]She just wishes that the feelings were returned.

This is really a great story about two people who are greatly attracted to each other but can't be together because of a situation (in this case civil war for a very small country) that is beyond their control.<br /><br />This story is very romantic and although this is a \\"romantica\\" story this is not a book with page after page of gratuitous sex scenes. Instead it's a story about strength and integrity, and yes, attraction.<br /><br />Nicolas is the half-brother of the President of Vistaria.  His country is on the brink of revolution and the last thing he needs is an instant and intense attraction to American Calli Munro.  She is everything that he wants but can't have.<br /><br />Callie on the other hand has just come to Vistation at the request of her uncle Josh.  On her first night in town she finds herself in jail with nothing and no one and she is less then thrilled.  Before she knows it she is being release after a rather intense interview with a red headed mystery man.  The attraction she feels for him is more then anything that she has felt in a very long time, and when he is about to walk away she tries to hold on, but mystery man walks away with a hit of sadness in his eyes.  She has no idea who her rescuer is and she can't get him out of her mind, even when she's asleep.  Soon her world will collide with his and she will find out just who Nicolas really is.  Even knowing she can't have him doesn't detract from their mutal attraction.  Will they ever be able to act on their feelings or will threat of war keep them apart?<br /><br />This was really an emotional story that was well told.  The characterization was right on, and Ms. Cooper-Posey does an excellent job of keeping our interest alive while at the same time keeps our lovers apart.  That is until...well, never mind I'll let you read the book!  This was a great book that I highly recommend to the fan of the romance genre.

This is one read that I will not be re-visiting again.	2004-09-08

This is one of those great romantic suspense novels that really have earned the title for the sub-genre \\"romantic suspense\\".  Ms Cassidy grabs you from the first page, and although you know who the bad guys is right from the start you are still compelled to continue on reading in order to see how this truly evil man finally gets his due.  And trust me the ending is wonderful.<br /><br />The characters Juliette, and Nick are great.  They come together under the worst circumstance you can think of, and yet their developing relationship is believable.  Billy, Juliette's son is an exceptional character to this already great story, and what would a suspense story be without the bad guy?  Bad guy David is an incredibly wonderful creation by Ms. Cassidy.  This guy drips evil from the get go and suffice it to say you will find yourself with a bad case of the hebby-gibbies.<br /><br />This was the first time I've ever read Ms. Cassidy, and she has now garnered another fan as far as her suspense writing goes!  This author has managed to pen a novel that doesn't stint on either the romance, or the suspense.  This is not always easy to do.  I highly recommend this read to any fan of the romantic suspense genre.  You won't be sorry.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-09-08

I really enjoyed Ms. Cole's first novel \\"The Captain of All Pleasure\\" and anxiously awaited her latest effort.  Trust me it was well worth the wait, and in my opinion better than the first.<br /><br />The characters, action, and chemistry all combined to make a this read not only a pleasure to read, but fun.  Victoria and Grant were wonderful main characters.  Their angst and conflict was not over the top and was actually true to form for both characters.  Victoria was a true free spirit, and Grant could not have been more uptight.  I know how could these two different people fall in love?  You'll just have to read the book.  Secondary characters such as Cammy, and Grant's family (yes, they are all back) only add to the story.  They are not \\"behind the scene\\" characters used as filler.  They actually play a very important and at time funny parts.  I laughed and I cried.  A true sign that a book is excellent if you can care about the characters enough to feel an emotion.  Also a sign of a talented author that can draw that reaction from a reader!<br /><br />Ms. Cole is truly a talented author, and one that I will now buy simply because her name is on the cover.  I am hoping her next effort won't be long in coming and that it might just be Ian's story (hint, hint...).  In any event this is a read that I highly recommend that you add to your \\"must read\\" list.  Trust me you won't be sorry.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-09-06

Ms. Davis Stein has penned an emotionally heart-tugging read and you will be loathed to put it down until the final page.  The combination of different cultures, religion, desires, and personal needs, are all aspects that Ms. Davis Stein has tackled in this debut novel.<br /><br />Ben Lonefeather is a loner who lives by himself with his three coyote friends on a Navajo reservation working on his art, and coming to terms with his past.  His life and what he thought he wanted is all about to change when Sarah Friedman chances to see some of his jewlery work and decides that she would like to buy some of his work for her family's gallery back in New York. This decision leads her to Ben and before he knows it he has a house guest and finds that Sarah has opened his soul in more ways then one as well as made a place for herself inside a heart he thought was long dead.  But will he do something about it before she has to leave for home, or will he let the best thing to ever enter his life, walk away?<br /><br />What starts out as a buying trip, for Sarah turns into a search into her own soul and she finds the one thing she wasn't really looking for.  Acceptance of how she is just as she is.  She spends only ten days with Ben, but it's ten days that she will not forget.  She's in love, but will Ben who has been hurt and coming to terms with his past grab hold, or will she drive off into the sunset?<br /><br />This story was amazing.  As I stated earlier this is a complex story touching on so many important and personal details that I was afraid one would be sacraficed for another.  This was not to be.  Ms. Davis Stein does justice to all of the various aspects she introduces at the beginning.  This is a story that will cause you to laugh, cry, and at times smile.  This is really more then just a romance of lovers meeting and marrying, it's about following your heart even if it leads to heartache to begin with.  It's truly about the journey as much as it is about the final ending.<br /><br />I highly, highly, highly recommend this read and I think we should all keep an eye out for this new and talented author.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]ut the final ending.

Ms. Bach has delivered another page turning read with her latest effort \\"Pure Dynamite\\".  This was a fast-paced read with plenty of suspense to keep you guessing as to who the bad guy really is, chemistry between our two main characters and enough twists and turns to keep you wondering whether Adam and Renata will have that happily-everafter they both deserve.<br /><br />Renata is a hard working doctor that works for an urgent care clinic.  She is working late one stormy night when a breath- taking stanger knocks on the door claiming to know her.  Her stanger is not what he appears, and after sharing one steamy kiss she finds herself held hostage literally by her mystery man.  Renata's well ordered life is about to take a turn towards danger and she will have to put her trust in a man she can't help be attracted too, but at the same time is terrified of, that is until he proves that he is not exactly what he seems.<br /><br />Adam has just escaped from jail and he has the company of a loud-mouth punk, named Lyle who has not only managed to get himself shot, but has managed to take a cop down with him.  What started out as a simple break out has now led to a shooting and the kidnapping of a beautiful lady doctor.  He kissed her to get her cell phone and beeper, but what starts off as a simple kiss disarms him in more ways then one.  Now he has to take the lovely and fiesty doctor on the road with him.  She has to keep Lyle alive or else.  He can't help but begin feeling things for her, and their close quarters don't lessen that draw.  He has to keep his act together no matter how bad he wants to let down his guard and make Renata his.  Will he be able to keep her safe until its time to tell her the truth about himself, or will matters be taken out of his hands by an evil man that will risk anything to remain free?<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Ms. Bach and I highly recommend her reads as a very entertaining way to pass the time.  Her characters jump off the pages and the chemistry between Renata and Adam is hot.  Not because they are constantly jumping into bed together, but instead because of the fact that they aren't.  If this is the first time you've ever read Ms. Bach I can guarantee it won't be the last.  On the other hand if you've already read her previous titles as I have, you will be anxiously waiting for her to get another one ready for publication!<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]nata and Adam is hot.

This book contains two of the older stories Ms. Hooper penned before she became the hugely succesful suspense author she is today.  These are more romance then her newer titles and as a result I found them to be entertaining.  The two titles are \\"Enemy Mine\\" and \\"The Haviland Touch\\".  Both of these stories put me in mind of action adventure movies such as the \\"Inidana Jones\\" series.<br /><br />\\"Enemy Mine\\" is set in the Columbian forest and Tyler St. James and Kane Pendleton are rivals the search the world over for interesting and rare artifacts.  They find themselves both being shot at over the search for the same chalice.  Now instead of just looking for the artifact they are now forced into a partnership that pits them against a common enemy and a race to stay alive.  Of course this close partnership forces them both to admit that they feel more then contempt for each other, and that maybe they aren't the enemies that they thought they were.  But will they be able to investigate that possiblity, or will they be killed first?<br /><br />In \\"The Haviland Touch\\" antique collector Drew Haviland is placed back into the sphere of Spencer Wyatt, the one woman that jilted him years earlier.  Spencer Wyatt is looking for the rare and sought after \\"Hapsburg Cross\\".  Her motivation for finding this item is driven by her dying father.  Now she has to accept the help of Drew the man she had left behind, and Drew is less then thrilled to having to be paired up with the spoiled Spencer.  But Drew ends up learning that Spencer is not exactly what she seems, and that perhaps she is worth fighting for.<br /><br />These were both very entertaining stories but I admit that second was my favorite between the two.  Ms. Hooper shows in these earlier efforts the talent that she had not yet had a chance to share with us.  It was fun reading her earlier work and seeing how far she has come.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-09-04

This is the first time I've ever read Ms. Wingate and I found her story to be not only entertaining but sweet.  Ms. Wingate's latest is the second in her \\"Texas Hill Country\\" series and since I've not read the first in the series I was pleased to find that this was a strong stand alone read, and that I missed nothing (except perhaps for a good read with the first of the books)and highly enjoyed myself during the process of reading this story.<br /><br />Laura Draper is a magazine editor on temporary duty in Texas.  She is on her way to a photo shoot that promises to make the first edition of \\"Texcetra\\" a smash hit.  Well, you can't always plan for everything and in the space of less then thirty minutes a hail storm, tornado threat, and Laura's personal relationship crashes down on her (over a cell phone call thank you very much) and make what should have been a red letter day, a red eye day from crying.  She closes her eyes for just a minute in what looks to be an abandoned parking lot in \\"crossroads\\".  She has no idea that this stop will change her life...for the better.  Here she meets two zany elderly twins and one strong but sweet man (our hero Graham Keeton) and finds herself laughing more then she had in a very long while.<br /><br />This story was great and I loved how it brought \\"small town life\\" to life!  This book made me laugh (the bat scene is great) and cry which, in my opinion is always a sign of a good book.  The romance between Laura and Graham is wonderful.  The chemistry is not steaming by any means but I think that's what makes it so much better and special. Laura grows personally during the course of this read, and the secondary characters, such as her father, her zany assistant Kristi, and her other friends all make this a worth while read.  I highly recommend Ms. Wingate's \\"Lone Star Cafe\\" for a wonderful way to spend an evening.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-09-03

Secondary characters are truly essential to the storyline and a great addition.<br /><br />This was a fast-paced read that showcases Ms. Knight's incredible talent as an author.  Be aware this is a hot read and that this may not be a read for the faint of heart.  The chemistry between Cade and Valerie is important to the story is in no way gratuitous or used as filler.

Ms. Wilks has penned a very entertaining book that combines suspense, romance, and the sub genre of the paranormal into a fast paced read that many fans of this genre will enjoy.<br /><br />Lily Yu is a cop that has taken on the task of finding who is murdering local citizens in a most gruesome fashion, and why.  This would not be such an unusual thing for a homicide detective except for the fact that it looks as though werewolves may be the problem. Especially when the killer looks as though he is the prince of the clan Nokolai, Rule Turner.  If that is not enough, Lily now finds herself drawn to the dark good-looking Rule, this cannot be a good thing.  Little does she know she has been the chosen mate for Rule and there is nothing she can do about it...unless she wants to turn her back on her heart.<br /><br />Together Rule and Lily investigate the killings and through investigating, finds that the killer may just be a cop and one that Lily is working with. Why is the killer trying to make the murders look as if a werewolf committed them and why?  Now it's a race against time and a killer who may just be magical in it's own way.<br /><br />This was a fast paced read.  There were at times moments when the read was not totally fluid and I felt as if I had missed something in a previous paragraph but for the most part this was few and far between.  Ms. Wilks make believe world was highly entertaining and Rule and Lily are not your normal hero and heroine.

Typical of this fantastic author, Ms. Brown has added another edgy read that couples all sorts of issues ranging from family loyalty, to murder, and safe working conditions.  Yes, I did say safe working conditions.  The issue of labor unions, safe working environment, and small town living all combine into a read that will have you both frustrated and enthralled.<br /><br />Why not a higher rating?  At times this book was a slow mover, and Sayre and Beck's relationship was unusual to say the least.  There were times that I began not to care one way or another about the main couple and questioned whether a believable ending could come about for these two (fear not though, Ms. Brown managed to pull it off).  Still this read is more of a mainstream work of fiction rather then the normal fare we are used to by this author.  This is not a bad thing.  It just took a little time to get used to is all.  There are plenty of twists and turns, and the murder of one of Sayre's brothers seems to be the plot that moves the story forward.  Work practices by the Hoyle family via for that same distiction, but in the end I feel that it may have been a tad over the top.  That's really all I can say without giving away anything.<br /><br />Ms. Brown has offered another good read that I think long time fans will enjoy.

This unfortunatly was not one of them.<br /><br />Ms. Ranney is a very talented storyteller and many of her books as I've stated have made it onto my keeper shelf.  What kept this read from joining those ranks?  Well, first off one read is plenty.  This is not a story that I'd want to re-visit.  The main reason for this is...frustration.  Lack of communication, and misunderstanding are trademark elements in Ms. Ranney books.  This is okay up to a point.  Then you cross the line into the unbelievable, and then I question how great a relationship can be if no one is talking, and only kissing and sighing.  I must give credit where credit it due.  Both were young at the beginning of the misunderstanding, and then years go by before they face each other yet again.  But now they're adults so act like one. They finally speak about 25 pages from the end of the book!<br /><br />If you've read the previous MacRea books it would be a shame to miss the final book in the series.  Although Ms. Ranney is not a must read author for me, I still find her books to be entertaining and worth reading if you are able to put the stories in a proper context and if you don't mind at times a little frustration.  If you like angst you will love Ranney!<br /><br />Offical Reviewer for [...]	2004-08-27

Ms. Macaire has created a make-believe world that was filled with wonderful entertaining characters such as Tania (our heroine) Wander the grandfather elf, and lets not forget magical Shabaz. Secondary characters as well only add to the wonderful cast of characters and the telling of the story.<br /><br /> This was also a very entertaining read.  I managed to inhale it in one day and I'm not generally much a fantasy genre fan. Ms. Macaire has managed to change my mind.  The storyline was great with time travel, magic, elves, and especially unicorns filling the pages.  The pace of the story was fast moving and I laughed out loud at moments, and even managed to cry.  This is always a sign of a good book in my opinion.  The important thing is you will find yourself side by side with the characters in the book fighting against the darkness that threatened to take control. I love a book that I can loose myself in.<br /><br />Ms. Macaire is a wonderful storyteller and one that I highly recommend.

I've been like many reviewers a long time fan of this author and have found this latest \\"Evil\\" novel to be less then inspiring, or fun to read.<br /><br />It does read like a textbook as far as the topic of psychic issues.  Our teaching was couched in conversation normally between Rafe and Isabel. We would hit these class lectures normally right in the middle of the murder/mystery portion of the book, and I would just be getting into the meat of the story, and then I would be derailed by \\"too much information.\\"  This is not to say that I don't care for instuction and added background.  I do, but there is a time when it is just too much.  We unfortunatly hit this wall of information throughout the story.<br /><br />This was just an okay read.  There was plenty of suspense (who was doing all of the killing and why) but I just felt that the fleshing out of the storyline, as well as character development was not truly priorty while writing the novel.  The relationship between Rafe and Isabel was rather confusing.  She spent most of her time lecturing him on paranormal issues, and less time letting her hair down and being relaxed while she was with him socially.<br /><br />To be honest I did skim a few pages, but still, I was okay as far as not missing anything important.  This was not her strongest effort and if you are picking Ms. Hooper up for the first time I highly recommend her other earlier reads or even the other two \\"Evil\\" reads.  An author can't be on \\"top\\" all of the time and we should just remember that she is capable of doing so much better.  I'm really looking forward to her latest series she has started that will still feature Bishop and his team, and hope that she is back on track as the author we love.<br /><br />Official reviewer [...]	2004-08-24

When I found out that this was a turn of the century set read I quickly picked it up.<br /><br />This was a fine read which included two great main characters,(Grayson and Aurora) that will have you as the reader rooting for their happily-ever-after. Finding that they are attracted to each other is not the problem.  Realizing that their love is strong and can survive outside the estate boundaries of Grayson's house is quite another. This read offers not only a fine romance that is as sensual as it can be, but it also offers a suspese storyline regarding who killed Grayson's father.<br /><br />I recommend this read for anyone that likes their romances spicy and sensual.  This is a fast-paced read that will allow you to step into a wonderful make-believe world if for only a little while.	2004-08-22

Once I found out she was back I quickly picked up this book and inhaled it in one day!<br /><br />The characters are wonderful and I can hardly wait for the rest of the books in this series.  Our heroine is tough and tender all at the same time.  Our hero is just how a hero should be.  Dark, handsome, with just a touch of insecurity which makes him real.<br /><br />Devon St. James lives in a rough part of London but she doesn't let that stop her from being a dreamer and working hard at holding her head high.  One night on her way home from her job at the tavern her life changes in a way she never expected.  Someone tries to rob her of her mothers necklace, an item that holds great personal meaning.  It came from her father that she never knew, and she fights for it.  She manages to hang on to it, but is stabbed in the side and is left for dead.  Dying in the gutter of St. Giles is not how she imagined her end.<br /><br />Sebastian Sterling, Marquess of Thurston has had is own battles to fight in his life.  He has had to live down the whispers and scandal that his mother brought down on their heads when she ran away with her lover only to die while crossing the channel.  He has just announced to society that he is now looking for a bride.  This of course has brought out all of the matchmaking mama's out of the woodwork.  His needs are simple, she must be refined, of good character, and she must want to have and love her childen.  Little does he know that he's about to learn a lot about what he thought he wanted and how you may just find what your looking for in the most unlikely of places.  Namely St. Giles on a rain drenched night looking for his brother Justin!<br /><br />This was a wonderful romance.  Each and every character brings something to the story.  The storyline although not new (girl from wrong side of the tracks meets a prince...okay lord) is told in such a way that it will stand out in your memory.  This was a sweet romance and one that I highly recommend!  Thank you Ms. James for finally returning and offering a read that was truly worth waiting for!<br /><br />Offical reviewer for [...]..okay lord) is told in such a way that it will stand out in your memory.

I'm a huge fan of Ms. Jackson's romantic suspense stories and this is the first time I've read any of her historicals and I found this read to be a strong read but after ahwile I became bored with Tara's attitude and \\"need to escape\\" mentality.  In the beginning yes, it was believable, toward the middle and end it was just down right disbelieving.<br /><br />Tara has lived her life with a mystery hanging over her head.  The circumstances of her birth are held as a secret.  She has been raised by Lodema in a forest with an Emerald as her only legacy.  Little does she know that the Emerald identifies her as the long lost heir to Tower Twyll.  Tara wants a lot out of life, what she doesn't count on is being abducted by an outlaw in the forest, nor does she count on the feelings he makes her feel.  What will happen when they find out that their actually suppose to be enemies?<br /><br />Rhys has been banished from Twyll by his evil half brother. As a result he has made a new life for himself as an outlaw.  He finds the beautiful and tempting Tara and at the same time sees the Emerald and makes the choice to abduct her for his own purposes.  He does not plan on feeling things for his beautiful captive, and these feelings could possibly change his desire for revenge if he lets it.  Will he continue with his plan of vengence, or will he follow his heart?<br /><br />Again this was a strong read but I found some of the characters rather clich&eacute;d, and as I stated earlier I started to feel frustration with Tara.  The chemistry between Rhys and Tara is hot and despite the strong willed nature of these two people they were able to find a strong love.  I look forward to reading more of Ms. Jackson's historicals in the future.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-08-20

I have been a long time fan of this talented author and I found her latest effort to have set a nice tone for her latest series.  The main couple Katherine and Alec are unusual and different and their story had many different twists that although may not be new per se still added to the story.<br /><br />Why not a higher rating you ask?  Well, first off this book in my opinion got off to a rather slow start and for that reason I have given it a lower rating then the others.  Otherwise with the exception of the slow start this was a fine read.  Ms. Jeffries is a very talented author and one that I highly recommend to my fellow romance novel reading fans!

Ms. Moning as penned another great story that you will be loathed to put down until you read the final page.  In her latest effort she has given us Adam's Black's story and it's just a fun if not more then her previous efforts within this series.<br /><br />Adam has been changed to a mortal (perish the thought!) and to add insult to injury, he finds out (thanks to our heroine Gabby) that he's invisible to his fellow Tuatha De and unable to contact anyone in order to get his fairy powers back.  Then he stumbles upon Gabby and this arrogant fairy finally realizes that although he has lived thousands upon thousands of years, he has not really lived!  Gabby is not only strong willed, she does not let Adam's incredible good looks turn her head, or soften her heart.  Together they work to save not only his Queen, but the special compact that is shared between the mortals and Fae from Darroc an Elder that is bound and determined to rule the fairy world.<br /><br />Gabby has a problem.  A BIG one!  She can see fairies and so she has to walk a fine line between not letting the Fae know this (she has had it drummed into her head since she was a small child that the Fae would carry her off and do lord knows what to her if they knew she could see them) and at the same time not letting her friends and co-workers think that she is a total fruit cake.  Her life was going just fine and dandy until the DAY.  She finally has a day that's for the record books.  If anything could go wrong, well, it did. Unprepared for anymore issues, or tragedies she sees Adam on a park bench and that was the end of that!  Suffice it to say Gabby is going to learn more about the Fae then she ever thought possible.<br /><br />This was a very fast-paced read, that not only offers laugh out loud moments, but it's a sensual read as well. You will be introduced to a whole new Adam, and you will also be able to visit with some old friends.  Ms. Moning is a very entertaining, and gifted storyteller and one that I highly recommend to any reader.<br /><br />Official reviewer for [...]to any reader.

I found Ms. Kauffman through the \\"Bad Boy\\" anthologies books that have already featured two of the Morgan brothers, (Jace, and Austin) and was looking forward to a full length effort for one of these sexy brothers. So, I quickly ordered the book without reading reviews and waited for it to arrive. Then to add insult to injury I took it with me on a very long road trip as a way to pass the time. What I ended up doing was skimming the majority of the story in order to move on to a new read. This book had so much potential but it just didn't deliver. It was almost too easy.<br /><br />I will give credit where credit is due though. Maura and Tag's romance is steamy and almost instant. And if this is ther reason why you read romance you won't be disappointed. For me I like there to be a little conflict or at least another sub-plot to drive a story forward. The problem with this was there was really no \\"conflict\\" to keep the lovers apart, or to work on. Really, this story could have been, and probably should have been a short story instead. This is not to say that I've written Ms. Kauffman off as an author quite the contrary. I actually look forward to her next effort. Just don't expect much from this latest effort.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-08-20

I loved all of the Becky Bloomwood books so when I found out that Ms. Kinsella had a new book, and a new character I raced out and got the book.  Long story short I couldn't find it here in Bruxelles, so I went and got it from the library and read it in ONE sitting!<br /><br />This was such a fast-paced read and was totally entertaining.  Emma is different from Becky so this was not a carbon copy type story.  In other words it's not like the shopaholic stories.<br /><br />Emma hates to fly and so while waiting for her plane to board she helps herself to a little liquid courage.  The fact that she has just left a business meeting that was less then successful and now has to fret about her job security is not helping.  An airline hostess hears her woes and offers to upgrade Emma to business class.  Emma's life is not going to be the same.  While on the flight the plane hits turbulence.  Combine turbulence with the liquid courage, and one silent, but handsome seat mate and Emma spills all. And I mean ALL!!! She tells all of her secrets thinking that confession is good for the soul if your getting ready to plummet to your death.  Besides he's a stranger.  She'll never see him again!  What does she care that she has spilled the fact that she weighs more then her boyfriend thinks, and that her knickers are the most uncomfortable item of clothing she is currently wearing, because said boyfriend bought them two sizes too small based on the aforementioned weight?<br /><br />Emma couldn't be more wrong.  Monday morning she walks into the office and finds out that her seat mate was actually the owner of the Panther Corp. Now she is faced with Jack Harper and the fact that he knows EVERYTHING!  What's a girl to do?<br /><br />This was a fun read.  Emma and the rest of the cast of characters were great!  Jack is a great hero and this story really had me laughing out loud at the different situations that Emma found herself in.  I'm not generally a fan of chick-lit but Ms. Kinsella an author of this genre that I will automatically pick up!  I highly recommend this latest effort by Ms. Kinsella.  Emma is a character that you will like just as much as you liked Becky! Maybe even a little more. For a fun and easy read you can't go wrong with \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\". Kinsella an author of this genre that I will automatically pick up!  I highly recommend this latest effort by Ms. Kinsella.  Emma is a character that you will like just as much as you liked Becky!

Ms. Medeiros delievers yet again with her latest historical set in England in the early 1800's.  This was a sweet read with great chemistry between the two main characters Gabriel and Samantha.<br /><br />Gabriel was wounded during the a battle that took Admiral Nelson's life aboard the \\"Victory\\".  Left blind he returns home a \\"hero\\" in the eyes of many, but a monster in his own blind eyes.  Living as a beast in his own country estate he has vowed never to let sunlight touch his face again.  Little does he know his life is about to change for the better with the help of his new, but determined nurse Samantha Wickersham.<br /><br />Samantha arrives at Fairchild Park knowing that her job won't be easy, but determined not to fail.  She has a secret that won't let her fail.  What she doesn't count on are the strong feelings that Gabriel brings out in her heart.  Still, despite Gabriel's surly nature she starts to bring sunlight back into Gabriel's and maybe just a little bit of magic as well into her own.<br /><br />Together they realize that sometimes you have to look beyond what's right in front of you to what's really there.  Can a strong love grow from a certain tragedy?<br /><br />This was a very sweet romance that was a pleasure to read.  Ms. Medeiros latest offering will touch on all of your emotions and will bring the reader both tears and laughter.  This was not a sensual read, but rather a sweet and romantic read.  There are plenty of twists and turns as well as a secret that Samantha has that helps drive the plot of the story.  This is a read that I highly recommend.	2004-08-16

This was another laugh out loud read by the talented Ms. Macalister.  Ms. Macalister has taken the concept of reality T.V. and has honed it to a fine thing by adding her own little twists and turns, by taking a featherbrained woman (in this case Tessa) and causing her to step back into history 125 years prior during Victorian times for a British reality T.V. show. Is she up for the challenge?  She better be!  Goodbye comfortable cloths, hello corset!  Did someone say corset???  And that's only just the beginning.<br /><br />Now she along with a cast that is made up of servants, and family members of a Duke she must now make due (at least for a few weeks anyhow) without T.V. and ibuprofen, as well as dealing with her sever reaction to her yummy pretend husband.  Did I mention she managed to throw up all over his shoes at their first meeting?  Great first impression!  Problem is Max (the fake Duke) and Tessa find themselves doing more then pretending.  They are starting to fall in love.  What does a 39 year old \\"skinny-challenged\\" woman and a 35 year old hunk have in common?  Surviving in 1879 Victorian England of course!  Of course this is easier said then done.<br /><br />This was a fun story which at time leaned toward the silly.  At times I just shook my head at the dim-wited thoughts of our intrepid Tessa.  The storyline was fun and the situations that Tessa found herself in were entertaining to say the least.  This was a pleasant read and one that I recommend if you like laugh out loud moments as well as romance in your romance read!	2004-08-13

I must admit that I've not been terribly thrilled with Ms. Johnson's past efforts.  \\"Hot Legs\\" though is more like her older historical's which were filled with wonderful characters, great storylines, and lets not forget great chemistry between the main characters.<br /><br />Without going into great detail let me just say that both main characters Bobbie and Cassie were not only likeable but I believed in the chemistry that they shared, and totally understood where the attraction was on both sides.  This was a fast-paced read which delivered on all counts.  I highly recommend Ms. Johnson's newest effort and I look forward to her next read with great anticipation!	2004-08-13

She always has qirky characters, fun storylines, and great chemistry between the main characters.  This story was no different except...this time around things are a little hotter, and a little darker.  These changes only show that Ms. Berg is a whole lot more talented in weaving a story that will have the reader glued to the pages.<br /><br />Angel Devlin is a \\"once bitten, twice shy\\" P.I. for the wealthy Palm Beach society crowd.  She drives a red Jag, and lives above a dog grooming establishment.  Oh she also wears a stiletto, Jimmy Choos, and nice clothes.  She also has an ex-husband named Dagger Zane who took her to the cleaners when she finally divorced him.  As if this was all not enough she is planning a gala ball for an Alzheimer's fundraiser (her mother has this disease) and has talked a rather reclusive man to host it at his estate.  Why is this a problem?  She has to keep him happy and march to his tune.  That shouldn't be a problem but it becomes on once she appears on the radarscreen of Tom Donovan.  Tom is big, bad, handsome and trouble!  Of course when you add Dagger, and a secret that Tom wants to solve to the mix you have the making for a great story.<br /><br />Tom has a dark past and a mystery he has to solve.  His father was acused of stealing a statue, and attacking the wife of his best friend.  Of course he was killed during the commission of these crimes.  Tom is out to prove that his father had not stolen anything, or attacked anyone.  This leads him to his godfather the one person Angel has to dance to.  He thinks he can use Angel to get to his godfather.  What he doesn't expect is falling for the sexy Angel.  Now he has to make a choice.  Clear his father's name and find out the truth about what took place the night his father died.  Or let the past lay and find love with Angel.<br /><br />This was a very fast read full of great characters, humor, and great chemistry between Angel and Tom.  The storyline regarding Tom's past was very entertaining and the mystery was solved at the end of the story.  This was a very good ending.  Ms. Berg delivers on all counts with her latest effort.

This is not to say that I will write off Ms. Lee with this first for me introductory read, on the contrary I will pick her up again.

Okay as you have probably already read this JQ book is a little different from Ms. Quinn's previous stories regardless of the series title. In this latest Bridgerton effort Ms. Quinn is short on humor and more focused on real emotion making this a much more emotional read then we are used to by this talented author. Does this make the read bad? Of course not. In fact it's nice to see Ms. Quinn stretch her talent by attempting to write a story that touches more on deep feelings regarding loss and confusion rather then wit and humor.<br /><br /> This story is actually suppose to take place simultaneously as &quot;To Sir Phillip With Love&quot; and &quot;Romancing Mr. Bridgerton&quot;. Francesca Bridgerton is now a widow and is dealing with the death of her husband John. His cousin and good friend Michael has not known a time when he has not been in love with Francesca. For him it was love at first sight after their first meeting. His life is retched because he can't seem to find love anywhere except with the one that he can't have. After the death of John, Michael leaves for India and spends four years living away from Frannie with the hope that &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot; will cure him of his love. This is not to be and when he returns he finds himself fighting his true desire once Francesca makes the announcement she wants a baby and is now willing to find another husband. Wish that it were him.<br /><br /> Francesca has mourned her sweet husband for four years and has decided she must join the ranks of the living. This means shedding her mourning and taking her place in society once again. While Michael has been abroad she has seen to his holdings and is happy to see his return. Of course she is unaware of the tender feelings he holds for her, so their reunion is not as happy or as sweet as Michael would have liked nor is it easy. Their seperation was set in motion by each other's pain and loss. Slowly they re-build their very strong relationship and feelings start to change for Francesca. She is starting to notice Michael as a man, a very handsome man, and seeing him less like a brother. How can this be? It's so wrong! Or is it? Will these two special people be able to see what is right in front of their faces and take a chance on love, or will Francesca loose Michael just when she realizes how much he means to her?<br /><br /> This was not a book filled with witty dialogue or funny jokes. Yes, there is some rather funny interaction between Francesca and her family and at times between Francesca and Michael. But these are few and far between. This story really takes a look at deeper emotions and as a result Michael and Francesca are not the normal kind of character's you find in Ms. Quinn's books. To me this was a nice change and I found this book to be more appealing then a few of the past Bridgerton books that have been release. I highly recommend this read if you care to find more then humor between the pages. This was a well developed story and one that I found a pleasure to read!nd feelings start to change for Francesca.

She decides her best bet will be an unkown dolphin facility located in the Florida Keys. Armed with her strength and conviction, not to mention her own personal trust fund she sets out to prove her dreams. What she doesn't count on is her very real and human reaction to Aunt Ruby's nephew Jack. He's the cause of more heat then the hot Florida sun and perhaps more trouble then Victoria can handle.<br /><br /> Jack is recovering from a very serious injury he received while working undercover for the DEA. He can't believe that his sweet Aunt Ruby has excepted a proposal of a marine mammal scientist as a way of fixing their dolphin facility. He promises that he's going to keep a close eye on Victoria the doctor. He can tell that the pretty Victoria is hiding something and he plans on finding out what exactly. What he dosen't count on is how the pretty little doctor makes him feel.<br /><br /> It's not long before Jack finds out what Victoria is hiding and in turns finds himself working hard to foil the person that is hard at work trying to de-rail her project. Togther they find that what they thought was important may not be so important after all. Perhaps love can change the way they look at things.<br /><br /> This was a fun read. The setting, topic, and characters all worked well together. The secondary characters such as Aunt Ruby, and lets not forget the dolphin \\"gang\\" are just as important to the storyline as Jack and Victoria. Ms. Stella is a very talented author and one that I look forward to reading again soon. I highly recommend this read!<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-08-04

Nothing weird about that...Right!!!<br /><br />Baran has come a long way to protect a civilian from a time traveling serial killer who has been his nemisis for years.  He figures he will come, protect the woman, and then get back to his battle in his own time.  Baran could not be more wrong.  Oh, he comes to save the day, but at the same time finds himself being drawn to the sassy Jane and this just won't do. He must have his act together in order to kill the bad guy, and lets not forget he's a warlord, not husband material...oh and he will be going back to his time 300 years into the future. Yeah these aren't problems when you're falling in love.  Wait...how would he know he's never been in love before!<br /><br />Jane and Baran become partners in every sense of the word.  Together they look for a killer before he has a chance to kill again or worse yet, get his hooks into Jane.  While doing this they find themselves falling in love. This is almost as dangerous as trying to catch the killer.  Can they walk this tight rope without falling off?<br /><br />Ms. Knight has served up another yummy hero, fun sassy heroine, and a great sidekick. A talking wolf that has a real problem not wanting to eat Jane's cat (trust me funny, funny, funny). There is plenty of humor, steamy chemistry, and a great storyline that is not your average run of the mill serial killer, ho hum, make you skip a few pages read. Why not five stars then you ask?  Well, Ms. Knight did introduce a side storyline regarding Jane's past that was never fully finished but was brought up more then once, and as a result I felt a little cheated. What happened to her mom??? Otherwise this was a great read.<br /><br />Ms. Knight is now an author I will pick up automatically.

These are stories from some great up and coming authors that will have you laughing out loud at times and fanning your face all at the same time.<br /><br />Janice Maynard's Suite Secrets is about Rebecca Fraser a reporter for a travel magazine and she needs to interview Sebastian Tennent the owner of these secret hotels in order to talk him into allowing her to do a story on the luxurious hotels.  Problem is that these are private hotels with secrecy being the main priority.  Sebestian knows he can't allow sexy Rebecca her story exclusive but makes a deal with her.  She comes with him to his newest hotel and poses as his wife and he might just let her have her story.  What happens is both of these different people find out that they have more in common then they thought and the steam the generate is...well you get the point.  Will either Rebecca or Sebastian get what they want or do they get something else all together?<br /><br />Morgan Leigh's Voices Carry is my favorite of the three stories.  Camelot Reeve has a problem.  He bosses voice turns her into a melted puddle of lust. Before she knows it she is finding herself involved with the one man she knows she can't have but can't stay away from.  Will Jonah be able to keep his lady?<br /><br />LuAnn McLane's Cabin Fever is great.  Rachel Manning is a successful author of inspirational novels.  Her big secret is she's also the author of some very sexy and erotic novels under a different name.  No one knows her secret until her sexy agent Jake Nichols finds her hidden away in the mountains penning just such a novel.  Before they know it these two different people manage to set a spake that could burn down a forest!<br /><br />This was a fun and rather fast-paced read.  I highly recommend any book published under the Brava imprint.  You are garaunteed a spicey read with great characters.  This book is no exception.	2004-07-27

Why you ask after all it's Lori? Truth was I was not sure I was going to be able see Cynthia and Bruce together but...I had nothing to fear. Ms. Foster managed to make be believe that these two very, very different people were able to fall in love.<br /><br />  As stated by a previous reviewer Ms. Foster's trademark sesuality was toned down a bit. Cyn is an ex-prostitute and Bruce is a preacher. Cyn has come from a very abusive life and Bruce is just the man to help her make a new life for herself. Ms. Foster was true to her character's and this has been my favorite out of the series so far.<br /><br />  We get to see Joe and Luna as well as Shay and Bryan again when we visit Visitation. Jamie Creed is also very much active in this story and as a result this was a great page turner that I took on the road with me to Poland. I highly recommend Ms. Foster. You will never be let down by this author and I look forward to the next in this series.	2004-07-27

This is one of those books that you read and think &quot;yes, I will read this one again one day.&quot; This story is epic in detail and spans three generations of the Cleary family.<br /><br /> This is really Meggie's story. She is one of the main characters that we follow as she finds love where it is least likely to grow but is unstoppable. She falls in love with Father Ralph and the feelings despite being wrong are returned. This is really a story that will have you laughing and crying. Set in Australia in 1915 Ms. McCullough writes vividly and eloquently and you will find this a hard to put down read. This is truly a classic in every sense of the word and one that I highly recommend.	2004-07-27

As a result people should avoid comparing it to her older works such as the Skye O'Malley series. This is a contemporary romance with a little sci-fi thrown in for a twist.<br /><br />Nora Buckley's perfect little world has come crashing down around her.  Her husband has finally asked for a divorce after playing the field for many years.  Nora has been so busy being super mom, and super housewife that she now finds herself having to fight her retched husband for her very existance.  Her friend turns her on to a special channel that plays out your most secret fantasy.  Before she knows it Nora is living in two worlds literally.  One is reality, and the other one is with Kyle in the channel and it's sinful, steamy, and sensual to say the least.  But can she have it both?<br /><br />As I stated earlier this is a departure from what Ms. Small has penned in the past and as a result some long time fans may have a problem with the setting. It should also be stated that this is a shorter story then most of her other stories and as a result not as in-depth as we are used to as well. This book is not just sex and there is in fact the storyline regarding Jeff and Nora's break-up that is rather detailed.  In any event this story was entertaining and one I would recommend for a fast read. Ms. Small is one of the best and you should come to this story with an open mind.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-07-27

I found this story to be another light read that does not require brain surgery.  For those that keep comparing this author to Helen Fielding I say Stop.  This is unfair to both author's since they have each carved out rather unique, funny, and likable characters. Brigit is nothing like Becky except they both come from England!  Move on.<br />I have found that there are really few &quot;Chick-Lit&quot; books out their that I find worth reading.  Those that I do find I crow about! Becky is a ditz, Luke is a prince (okay I would like if there was just a little more to this romance but hey beggers can't be choosers!) and I thought the way he proposed was so sweet and romantic!  Becky's life is funny and who can't at time relate to her?<br />For a light read that will help pass the time Ms. Kinsella is an author that I would highly recommend!	2004-07-16

First off if you've read the previous reviews you will see that Ms. Fieldings latest offering is not BJ.  Okay so now that we've gotten that out of the way lets chat about what it is.<br />This is a fun light read that will have you traveling the world with one space cadet of a heroine by the name of Olivia Joules.  She is writer that has an incredible knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time all the while trying to get a story that will be front page worthy of the publication that she writes for.  This book is really &quot;James Bondesque&quot; kind of read which is at times funny and witty and at other times outright ridiculous.  In any event it's entertaining.<br />Again this is not Bridget Jones's Diary and to be fair to Ms. Fielding, one should allow this talented author room to explore other creative avenues.  Although this effort has not made it onto my keeper shelf I would not be quick to throw it in the trash bin either.  I've actually read the British version of this book and found the illustrations to be an added bonus and quite fun.<br />Chick lit now has another semi-worthy effort out for reader appreciation.  It's not as good as some but it's defiantly not as bad as the others.  Come to this book with an open mind and I think you may just be surprise.  In any event the ending is explosive and...fun.	2004-07-14

The first novel I read by Ms. Chevalier was &quot;Lady and the Unicorn.&quot;  Since then I've picked up every single title this talented author has penned.  Some have been great, some have been just so so.  I found Ms. Chevalier's first effort to be very entertaining with it's dual storylines.  One from a historical perspective and the other a contemporary but they are both woven together to tell the story of one family. One should be aware since it is not stated prior to the start of the story that the historic portion of the story surrounding Isabelle du Moulin is set during the Protestant Reformation.  This was an amazing scary time in history.  Although there is a end note at the end of the story it may help some readers understand what is going on.<br />Ms. Chevalier is a very talented author and if you've read her before you may find this effort not as good as other titles.  I suggest you come to this read with an open mind and if you don't compare you will find this a very nice and entertaining read.	2004-07-14

Okay for those of you that follow any or all of my reviews you know that I have a dismal problem with reading books out of order when it comes to series.  Sometimes that's a problem, other times it's not a tragedy at all!  If there are some of you out there like me (I can't believe I'm the only series challanged person out there...at least I hope not) fear not fellow reader if you've picked up this title without the previous title you will have no trouble what so ever.  This is a stand alone read for sure!!!<br />Now that I've gotten that off my chest just let me say that this was a FANTASTIC read!  I loved it all!  The storyline, the characters (especially YUMMY Hunter our hero), storyline...well you get the picture.  This was a winner all the way around!<br />Serena Hamilton has know loss.  Her husband dies at an early age while on an assignment for the Army, and her mother has just recently passed away after fighting cancer.  One night she just can't take the loneliness one more moment and heads out to a Texas bar.  There after a few too many drinks she goes home with our hero Hunter.<br />Hunter is fine with one night stands.  He is an oprartive for the CIA and he is basically a ghost.  He has secrets that he keeps locked away and they are not all duty related.  He doesn't think that anyone can get past the fortress that he's built around himself.  That was until he sees Serena.  Now despite his best efforts he can't get her out of his head, and it looks like she is slowly making her way into his heart.  This means trouble in more ways then one.  Especially since his past and her past has a direct connection.  One that could break the fragile bond that they currently have.<br />Serena and Hunter are great characters.  I found this story beautifully written, which kept me glued to the pages from the moment that I began the story.  Secondary characters were great!  Those of you that read the first book &quot;Hard Lovin' Man&quot; will be glad to visit again with Jack and Kelley.  Riker Serena's son is great and there are a couple of times that I did manage to tear up!  I highly recommend this read.Jack and Kelley.

Ms. Michelle has penned a great Vampire Romatica story that was not only very sensual but had a storyline that was great fun. The characters of this story had great chemistry and Ms. Michelle managed to combine not only sensual love scenes but also humor in a story that is fasted paced. You will be loath to put this book down until the final page. I'm very careful about what vampire stories I read but I will be adding Ms. Michelle to my \\"must read\\" list immediately.<br /><br />Lucian is a vampire that has been looking for the reincarnation of his love Elizabeth. He knows that he will find her it's only a matter of time, or is it? He begins to loose faith when he literally brushes up against a woman leaving a cemetery and he feels something for the first time in years.<br /><br />Rana Sterling has just buried her beloved grandfather Jack. She is trying to come to terms with her loss when she comes across an antique dealer and finds an unusual ring that she feels compelled to buy. This purchase will change her life. Before she knows it she finds herself dreaming the most sensual and erotic dreams of her life. She can't believe it when she comes face to face with her dream lover. What she doesn't know is that her life is about to change in ways that she can't imagine but is fate going to take her away from Lucian before she realizes how much she cares for him?<br /><br />This was a fast paced read that was not only humorous but also sensual.

This was the first time I've ever read Ms. Balogh and I found her to be very precise in her writing and very true to the time period that she has selected to set her story.<br /><br />This is a story of two people that are totally different but each has been hurt personally and carries the scars and reacts to situations completely different.  Kit our hero laughs and Lauren our heroine is the perfect \\"lady\\" in every particular way.  Together they make a bargain.  Kit will give Lauren a summer to remember and fun memories to carry off into her spinsterhood, and Lauren will pretend to be his betrothed (just for the summer mind you) in order to prove to his family that he has gotten his act together.  The plan backfires though and each start feeling things despite trying not to.  Will they part ways once summer comes to an end?<br /><br />This was a nice story and Ms. Balogh was fair to the characterization when it came to Kit and Lauren.  What was difficult to understand was why Kit who was already rather emotionally scarred was willing to put up with Lauren's rather high-in-the-instep attitude repeatedly.  To be fair to Lauren she was raised in a situation, which made her feel compelled to always do the right thing.  Letting go and laughing and having a good time would not be something that would come easily to Lauren. I guess this is why opposites attract.  In any event these two mismatched people find love and it was nice to read a story where the love scenes were sweet and the characters learned not only about each other but also about themselves.  I recommend Ms. Balogh for a sweet romantic read.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for [...]	2004-07-10

Dinah McCall AKA Sharon Sala has penned another page turning romance that incorporates a little psychic ability, a little good old fashion southern superstition and wonderful characters.  This is billed as a romantic suspense but the suspense level is low and you are aware of the \\"bad guy\\" is from the beginning.  It's more of a secondary storyline that Ms. McCall builds the romance on.  Secondary characters are important to the storyline but not difficult to keep track of .<br />Although she is aware of her &quot;gift&quot; Laurel Scanlon is equally aware that her father finds it to be unbelievably annoying not to mention embarrassing that she continues to acknowledge what he find to be a disability.  It was a gift she has inherited from her mother and one that has been passed down from generation to generation.  Mimosa Grove is where Laurel goes to find peace.  This beautiful haunting place is where her mother grew up and it was left to her when her grandmother died.  On top of all of her other problems with her high profile father she has fallen in love with a mystery lover that only visits her in her dreams.  She thinks that getting a fresh start in Bayou Jean Louisiana is the answer.  Once she arrives she finds more then she ever thought she would.  She finds love and acceptance and a ghost that wants to rest in peace.  And if that's not enough one of her father's cases is about to pull Laurel into the center where her death is almost certain.<br />Justine Bouvier has been having the most erotic dreams of his life and he thinks he's loosing it since he has not been able to shake the feelings he has for his mystery lover.

Although this is considered the first book in the Brotherhood of the Sword series this is actually the third time we've been introduced to some of these characters.  I think that, this is one of the reasons I love Ms. MacGregor's books.  You are almost always gauranteed a chance to visit with old friends.<br />This is Stryder of Blackmoor's story and I must admit I didn't care for this knight in the anthology &quot;Where's My Hero?&quot; where Ms. MacGregor introduced us to not only this series but this character.  My fears were totally misplaced and I found that Stryder is a complex character who was easy to care about.  His feelings and thoughts are results of his past.  Although this is a rather complex story with many characters they are easy to manage if you're paying attention to what your reading.  Trust me it dosen't require a map nor brain surgery to keep it all straight.<br />Rowena is a great character and does not have her head turned by a pretty...okay handsome face.  She actually has no use for knights and the things they stand for.  That is until she finds herself in the strong arms of Stryder.  Now she must keep her wits about her or she may just fall in love with not only a man but a knight who just me leave her to fight the injustices in the world.  The fact that Stryder does not help by keeping his distance, and his kisses touch something in her that she thought was never there only adds to her confusion.<br />Stryder has made a vow and nothing and no one will keep him from it.  Add to the fact that he is constantly ambushed by women who are anxious to be his countess he has grown rather allergic to the female race.  That is until he saves a lady from a nasty spill.  Now he can't keep his mind nor his lips off of her.  She is so different from the normal ladies he runs into.  She actually sees deeper then the surface and has not run screaming.<br />Together they face the chanllenges and threats that follow them.  Stryder's past is catching up and fellow members of the Brotherhood are being killed.  They must find out who the assasin is before he strikes again.<br />This is a strong story to mark the beginning of another great series.  The groundwork has been set by introducing us to several of Stryder's knights that hopefully will be appearing again soon.  The romance between Rowena and Stryder is sweet and spicy.  There are laughs and tears aplenty in this read.  I highly recommend Ms. MacGregor (AKA Sherrilyn Kenyon) for a wonderful read regardless of the time period or genre!

This was a fun story with great characters.  Becky is a bit spacey but fun, and not at all malicious. You really can't help but like her and isn't that what's important when you read a book?  Likable characters?  This is chick-lit at it's finest.  This is without a doubt a light fun read and Becky's ups and downs are not only funny but also at times realistically scary.  I don't have a thing about shoes but put me in a Laura Ashley store and watch out!!!<br />Ms. Kinsella has a winner here and I can hardly wait to read the first in this series nor can I wait to see Becky tie the knot!

I know when will my greed end?!<br /><br />I really can't pick a favorite story from the seven offered, all were great in their individual way.  This was the first time I've ever read multi-cultural Kayla Perrin so she was a treat for me.  I look forward to picking her up again.<br /><br />Otherwise Ms. Davidson keeps up her tradition of quirky charactes and fast-paced dialouge.  Ms. Foster...what can you say about Lori except it's Lori!!  No summer would be complete without adding her to your reading list.  Ms. Denison gives us another Wilde brother and one hot read, and Ms. McCarthy adds her two cents worth of steam and summer fun with the antics of Dr. Sara Davis.  Ms. Leigh continues her series she started in the \\"Wildest Dreams\\" anthology (fear not although I have that book in my 'must read' pile out on the sun porch I haven't made it that far yet. So if you haven't read it yet like me you won't be lost) and it's great.  I can hardly wait to read the first in the series. Something would be wrong if I read a series in order!<br /><br />This book as stated earlier offers seven very fast reads.  Don't look for indepth storylines...there's not enough time.  Despite this or maybe because of this it's easy to put down and pick up again.  I highly recommend this read to anyone who likes their stories short and steamy...I mean sweet...okay I mean both!

Okay first off I knew going in by the title that this was going to be fluff.  What I didn't expect was the superficial space cadet mentality that was within the pages.  Perhaps it's because I seriously find selfish self-involved name-dropping people trite and sadly lacking imagination.  This book encompasses it all and more.  The only reason I continued to read this book was because I paid good money for it and I wanted to get something out of it.  What I got was a belly full of brand names, acronyms, and unlikable \\"Moi\\".<br />Other reviewers go on and on about the laugh out loud moments they read.  Did we read the same book?  What's funny about suicide attempts, shoplifting, (by someone that could afford the goods to begin with) and flitting back and forth between men and self-involvement?  The answer is nothing.  I like a light read just like anyone else.  I also like character development, (characters that I can care about) and a storyline.  Where was the storyline?<br /> As an aspiring writer I know it's not easy, and more often then not it's an uphill battle to get your manuscript written let alone published.  So for this alone I give snaps to Ms. Sykes.  She has managed to join the ranks of the published.  And just as she wrote this book with a target audience in mind I accept the fact that I am not part of that demographic.  These \\"Sex in the City\\" type books are just really falling short on the entertainment value when a whole book totaling over 300 pages goes nowhere.  Chick lit may be the newest rage but so far I've found it to be less then inspiring if this is the best it has to offer.	2004-07-05

Before she knows it she has stepped out of the frying pan and into the fire when she is accused of poisoning one of her protectors.  Now the brother of said murdered victim is out to make Sarah pay.  He wants her to suffer like she has never suffered before.<br />Stephen is the Duke of Whitbury and he has finally tracked down the person he holds responsible for his brothers death.  Problem though is he is physically drawn to Sarah and now he questions whether he will be able to follow through with his plans and send her to the gallows like she deserves. Or will he turn protector and care for her and her daughter?  What will happen to these two very different but strong people who find love in the most unlikely place?<br />Ms. Lindsey is a wonderful author and I look forward to reading her again in the future.  This is a very sensual read but the storyline is not sidelined for thrills.  I highly recommend Ms. Lindsey as an author to pick up and one to watch in the future.	2004-07-05

Her past offering over the last few years left me wondering if the author that penned &quot;Violets in the Snow&quot; and &quot;Emerald Enchantment&quot; two of my favorite books had indeed written the stories?  I'm so glad that Ms. Grasso has returned with not only a new story but one that made me laugh out loud and weep softly!<br />Victoria has been secretly betrothed for a year.  She meets her intended only a few short weeks before the &quot;I do's&quot;.  Not realizing that Aleander Emerson will soon be her husband she takes the advice of her sisters to practice flirting with him.  Victoria meets Alexander and their attraction is immediate!  For both.  Now if they could only put their individual problems on the back burner to realzie what is right in front of their faces.<br />Alexander agrees to the engagement to the last daughter of the man his father ruined (did you follow that?) it's the least he could do.  What he doesn't expect is the powerful way he feels after sharing just one kiss.  He decides that marriage to Victoria many not be easy, but it sure won't be a hardship.  Now if he can only stop the plots that have been set in place to destroy their fragile bond before it's to late.<br />This was a wonderful read with a great cast of characters.  Victoria is not a milk and water miss and her issue with dyslexia makes a wonderful secondary storyline.  Alexander is a great hero and just the right match for Victoria.  I highly recommend this latest offering by Ms. Grasso.  If you've never read her before you're in for a treat.  If you have read her past  few titles but have found them wanting you will be very happy to see that she is back writing as she did in the past!	2004-07-03

Do yourself a favor and don't compare this book to Ms. Donovan's past titles!  This one although not having the same amount of humor as &quot;Knock Me Off My Feet&quot; and &quot;Take A Chance One Me&quot; is still a wonderful read with a great cast of characters.  This read is a little bit more emotional then her past efforts and as a result tugs on the heart strings more then tickles the funny bone.<br />Charlotte Tasker is a young widowed mother of two.  She does it all, little league, ballet, working, and cooks healthy homecooked dinners, but has a secret love for cheez whiz and erotic poetry.  She also has a memory that keeps her warm at night and that is the memory of the only man she's ever felt connected to. She relives that one incredible afternoon together thirteen years earlier.  The things he said, how he made her feel alive and she never knew his name.<br />Joe Bellacera is a DEA agent that has had to go into hiding.  His partner and best friend was gunned down in front of his very eyes.  His testimony is key in puting away one of the worst drug lords ever.  So where do the power that be send him?  To Minton, Ohio of course.  He figures that he will die of bordom before he has to testify, that is until he gets a look at his neighbor.  No one is more shocked then Joe when he sees his mystery lady laughing in the yard.  Joe has not been able to get Charlotte out of his mind nor his heart.  He looked for her for years but was never able to find her.  Now when he needs to lay low he finds the one woman he has measured all others to.  No matter how hard he tries he just can't stay away.<br />Charlotte can't believe her eyes when she sees Joe.  He is her fantasy man and now he's right next door.  Can she put aside all of her misgivings and allow herself the one thing that she needs?  Together Charlotte and Joe learn everything they missed out on over the past thirteen years and find that their attraction is still as hot as ever.  Will they be able to find a &quot;happily ever after&quot;?<br />This was a wonderful story.  Granted Charlotte and Joe do not really have a face to face meeting until almost 90 pages into the book.  You still are able to see their attraction via flashbacks and memories.  This is more of an emotional read which touches on all the things you can think of when it comes to finding your one true love after living a lifetime without them.  Each come to the relationship with their fair share of baggage and Ms. Donovan is fair to this situation.<br />Ms. Donovan's trademark wit is not as apperant in this story but it would have been out of place.  Still there are plenty of quirky characters, and yes Hoover the dog adds his two cents worth of humor.  This is truly one read that you won't want to miss out on.  I highly recommend this title as well as any of the other's this talented lady has penned!&quot;happily ever after&quot;?<br />This was a wonderful story.

This was the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Black but I found this to be a great suspensful and sexy read.  I look forward to reading her again in the future.<br />Dr. Nikki Adenike is a sucessful surgeon who has a sexy secret but one that she will not act out. Then one night she surfs the web and decides to act on her fantasy.  This leads Nikki to begin a private e-mail relationship with Richard, a quite divorced teacher.  \\"Richard\\" is everything this lonely doctor has been looking for.  After repeated requests to meet face-to-face Nikki has her Richard checked out by a P.I. and finds that he seems to be safe.  In reality she has set herself up for more then she bargains for.<br />Someone is hunting strong, successful women in the Cleveland area and he brutally tortures them and then kills them by cutting out their hearts.  The press has called him \\"Lucifer\\" and he is closer to the devil then anyone knows. What is worse he has is sights set on Nikki.<br />Thomas is a tough as nails cop that has been hunting this killer for over nine years.  The hunt is personal and he intends to see it to the end.  The end of Lucifer that is.  What he dosen't count on is his growing attraction to one of Lucifer's victims Dr. Nikki. She is the only one that has gotten away alive and he will move heaven and earth to make sure she stays that way.  Even if he has to protect her himself.  Together they come to grips with past experiences and their growing attraction while hunting for a killer.  Who is Lucifer and will they catch him before he finally gets his hands on Nikki?<br />This was a very fast-paced, and sexy read! You are kept guessing until the very final pages as to who Lucifer really is.  The chemistry between Nikki and Thomas was HOT.  Thomas is Yummy and a great hero for Nikki! This book also has a little supernatural storyline that is very important to the main storyline regarding Lucifer.  I enjoyed the secondary characters a great deal and hope the Ms. Black pens a story for Kim, Nikki's best friend.<br />I highly recommend Ms. Black's \\"One Dark Night\\" for edge of your seat reading that is not only romantic, but spicy!I enjoyed the secondary characters a great deal and hope the Ms. Black pens a story for Kim, Nikki's best friend. <br />I highly recommend Ms. Black's \\"One Dark Night\\" for edge of your seat reading that is not only romantic, but spicy!	2004-07-01

Although this has not been my favorite by Ms. Hill it was still a funny, well written book with great characters and a fun storyline.  If you have been reading about this fun family from the beginning (&quot;Love Potion &amp; Tall, Dark &amp; Cajun&quot;) you will know who Charmaine is and this is finally her story!<br />Charmaine is an ex-Ms. Louisianna, hair dresser, who has been married and divorced (at least she thinks so) four times.  Now she is on the run from the Mafia and if that's not enough trouble she finds out that her first husband (okay first true love but she won't admit it) is fresh out the prison, and that low and behold they are still married and she owns half of a cattle ranch.<br />Raoul &quot;Rusty&quot; Lanier is fresh out of jail after two years.  He was set up and his first priority is to find out the who,and the why.  What he dosen't count on is running into his ex.  Charmaine still has the ablity to knock him off his feet.  The next thing he knows she's hiding out with him at his cattle ranch toting enough food to feed an army, a hope chest, oh...and lets not forget good 'ol St Jude.  He knows his life will never be the same again.  This could be a good thing!<br />This was a fast paced read, and one that I found fun.  All of the gang is here especially Tante Lulu.  The chemistry between Charmaine and Raoul is Cajun hot.  For a fun day at the beach read or just lying around the house you can't go wrong with Ms. Hill!	2004-06-28

This is without a doubt a book that falls under the sub-genre Erotica.  With that said I would like to point out that although the sex scenes are hot and plentiful they by no means cheapen the storyline.  The characters are great and the storyline is also very entertaining.  Emma Holly is without a doubt a very talented and gifted writer and one that I highly recommend if you like your romance reads steamy, hot and uninhibited.	2004-06-28

Since I've read the previous two books in this series I waited anxiously wait for this one to be released in paperback.  The second it hit my military bookstore I picked it up.  I must admit to some disappointment here.  Chase was a good hero. In fact I have been waiting to read his story since he was the one that appealed to me the most.  Sloane on the other hand really didn't do it for me as his match.  I think it may be like a previous reviewer stated she ran hot/cold but missed anything in-between.  From this point on this book followed your standard romance formula read.  As a result I felt just a little cheated.  Perhaps if I had not read the previous two titles I would not have had such great expectations.  Still this is worth giving a read and I look forward to reading Ms. Phillips again.	2004-06-28

This story to date has been my favorite by Ms. McKenna and I've read all of her stories.  We meet a whole new group of people and the storyline is entertaining. So if you have read all of her full length novels your in for a treat.  This book is very different from &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; and &quot;Standing In The Shadows&quot;.  This is more of a downhome story with the characters all having had a past history together.  They grew up experienced good times/bad times...you get the picture. There is a slight suspense storyline in the background.  The main focus of this story is the renewed relationship between the towns &quot;bad boy&quot; Simon Riley and the &quot;good-girl&quot; Ellen Kent.<br />The chemistry between Ellen and Simon is both sweet and explosive.  It was very entertaining to read how these two very different people managed to face that which scared them the most and how they each could be the strength for the other. While at the same time trying to figure out if Simon's uncle killed himself or was murdered.<br />This was a fast paced read that kept moving.  There were no slow spots to drag down the story.  Secondary characters and flashbacks help with the background that was missing.  Ms. McKenna is a truly gifted storyteller and one that I highly recommend!	2004-06-27

Although this is an erotic romance I felt rather cheated with the relationship between Dave and Tracy. Or rather the romance. I thought they would be the main focal point of the story but this is not the case.  Yes there is a developing relationship but I felt like it was almost secondary to the storyline revolving around Kim's (this is Tracy's sister) lovemaking program that she holds once a month at Dave's hotel out in the Catskills.<br />Tracy has been emotionally abused by her ex-husband he accused her of being frigid and that's the reason behind his affairs.  She goes back home and licks her wounds quitely and keeps men for the most part at arms length.  Her sister finds out she's pregnant with twins and since she is in her 40's must take it easy.  This means that she has to back down from a lot of her responsiblities and this means her weekend seminars. She askes Tracy to take over but she is reluctant.  What does she know about good sex?  Tracy goes to one of her sisters seminars and meets Dave.  Between the different seminars that her sister hold and Daves persistance Tracy finds her self sexually waking up.<br />The story started out good but eventually slowed to the point where we seldom saw Tracy and Dave together but had plenty of interaction with secondary characters.  I was unsatisfied with the ending between Tracy and Dave and felt rather cheated. I wish Ms. Lloyd would have spent more time with the relationship between Dave and Tracy. This was still a good read just not what I normally look for in the romance genre.  I wouldn't write the author off and I will try her reads again sometime.	2004-06-24

She is falling in love with Alex all over again and this time he seems to suffering from the same problem.  What will happen between them when the find Sophia?<br />The was a warm and fun book.  The chemistry between Jane and Alex is great and the situations that they find themselves in are both romantic and funny.  This was a fun book to read since the location is so exotic.

Great suspense, wonderful chemistry between the two main characters but at times I felt that there was just too much information to process.  Secondary character's are important to the plot but even then I think there were just too many of them.<br />There is a serial killer hunting in San Francisco.  He's picking high profile victims and he has dubbed himself \\"Lady Killer.\\"  Jessica Crawford is a reporter for a local newspaper.  The investigating reporter that normally would handle the serial killer case is in rehab so Jessica takes over and writes an article under a different byline and it sends the killer into a rage.  Before she knows it she is center in a real life drama which will soon strike closer to home then she comfortable with.<br />Cole \\"Tag\\" Rawlings has finally come back to life after dealing with an emotional and personal tragedy.  He meets a woman at his brother's surf resort and after an afternoon of wonderful steamy sex realizes that he's ready to get on with his life.  Problem is when he was done taking care of an emergency he returns only to find her gone.  He decides at that moment that he has to get back on with the business of living and that means earing a paycheck.  He takes a job in San Francisco at newspaper where he will be the investigating reporter.  What he doesn't expect to find is his mystery woman nor the mess that he find her in.  A serial killer may just be stalking her and despite his best efforts to stay mad at her he keeps feeling things that are anything but anger, and the fact that a killer has her in his sights is unacceptable.  Together they will put the pieces of the puzzle together that will lead them to a serial killer before he has a chance to kill again.<br />As I stated earlier this was a strong romantic suspense but the added background information such as the running of a newspaper, how to surf the internet, or even how to surf waves bogs down the read.  Much of this could have been left out and the book would have still been good.  Perhaps even better.  This was a fast moving read and although you know who the killer is it dosen't detract from the story.  I recommend this book and author for a good solid read.ch of this could have been left out and the book would have still been good.  Perhaps even better.

It won't be my last!!!  Although this is an erotic romance, Ms. Warren managed to pen a story with a fun storyline with great characters and not one aspect of this book was dropped due to the nature of the book!<br />Regina has just broken up with a looser and is not really in the market for a new one.  Her friends have another idea all together.  They feel that they need to hook her up with her \\"Fantasy Fix\\".  She is going to live out her most erotic fantasy whether she want to or not.  Feeling cornered she writes down the most outrageous things she can think of knowing that they won't be able to pull it off.  Well, Regina has no idea what's in store for her but she will sooner then she knows!<br />Dmitri is not what he seems.  He's tall, dark, yummy, and a vampire.  He sees Regina across a crowded bar and realizes that she is his mate.  The one woman that he has been looking for, for centuries.  He only has to prove to her that he's what she wants.  With his supernatural powers he finds out what he deepest darkest fanatasies are and sets to acting them out for her.<br />Winning Regina's heart will not be easy but the chemistry between them is too hot and Regina can't seems to get Dmitri out of her head.  Literally!!  Will Regina find that she can't turn her back on the fantasy of her dreams?<br />As I stated earlier this was a great romance.  Romance being the key word in the previous sentence.  Although this is an erotic romance, sex is not the only thing you will find in between these pages.  Ms. Warren has a quirky sense of humor that she shares with her readers, as well as developing wonderful characters.

Ms. Mason managed to write a romance that was not overly-graphic (the description of kisses was as racy as it gets) but lost none of the magic of falling in love.  I think this was one of the reason's why I enjoyed the book so much.  This is a book that I recommend that you add to your summer reading list.

This is James book (we met him in 'The Pirate Next Door')  Our fearless pirate hunter is still on the trail of Black Jack Malloy's the man that killed his brother.  His search takes him to the island of Haven and back into the arms of Diana Worthing.  James had a rather colorful first time meeting with the strong willed Diana, one that he has not forgotten despite his best efforts.  He's almost positive that she would rather shoot him then save him which is too bad since he has been shipwrecked and washed up on her island hidaway.  And need of help on top of that!<br />Diana can't believe her eyes when she spots James Ardmore washed up on her beach.  The urge to finish him off is great but instead she saves his retched life and opens her life to more turmoil that only James can provide.  If only she didn't desire the rogue so much!!!  James does all that he can to seduce the strong willed Diana.  While doing this he looks for Jack.  Little does he know he's finally near his enemy but what happens after a promise is broken, and a hunt comes to an end?  A happy Ending...Not quite or rather not right away.  Where would the fun in that be?<br />This was a little darker then the earlier read.  James is not as light hearted as Grayson was and this is carried over into the story.  Diana is a strong willed hoyden and at time was a bit over the top.  In any event these two have great chemistry and the story is fun and fast paced.  I look forward to the next installment of this series.	2004-06-13

This book was not as wonderful as or as funny as I thought it would be.  I read the books before I read the reviews and I should have done just the opposite.  I truly didn't find any humor in self centered parents, a 'willing to be a doormat nanny', or the spoiled but ultimatly ignored child Grayer.  I must admit that I did finish the book only because I spent the money and didn't want to waste it, the authors took the time to write it, and someone in publishing felt it was worth publishing.  Take my advice, borrow it from a friend, or the library if you're set on reading it.  Otherwise I would just avoid it all together.  There was really nothing redeeming about the read at all.  Not one likeable character, and a serious lack of wit or humor.	2004-06-06

The three author's have all managed to pen winners and that is something since these are short stories and not full length novels. You won't feel cheated at all.<br /><br />In Ms. Foster's story 'Good With His Hands' we have two neighbors that are friends but each has been thinking a bit too much about the other.  Then one day everything changes!  Cassidy decides that she will try to make herself a bit more attractive (think tomboy here) and Pete (You've met him in the past.  Brother to Gil, and Sam) is willing to change become a little more refined.  Well, duh...each likes the other just the way they are.  After one day of amazing...relations these two realize that they can still be friend and lovers too.  What a concept.<br /><br />In Ms. McCarthy's 'Miss Extreme Congeniality' we hook up again with Wyatt Maddock (Smart Mouth) and CJ White (Also Smart Mouth).  This is their story.  CJ has an autistic child and she is very weary about men in general.  Especially after Sam's dad takes a hike because he can't stand the pressure of a special needs child.  Unfortunatly Wyatt is everything CJ knows she should avoid but she makes a deal with him.  One night with Wyatt with him calling the shots and he will request a transfer out of the Chicago FBI Office.  Well, one night only proves to Wyatt he's not going anywhere...he wants it all with CJ!  Can he show this injured woman that he is willing to stay around for the long haul?<br /><br />In Ms. Leigh's 'Last Call' Tess Braeden falls in lust at first sight with hunky Fletcher.  She thinks he's the town mechanic and he can help her with getting an audience with the mayor who seems reluctant to give her even one second of his time.  Well, she's had more then a second with the mayor, she's kissed him.<br /><br />Fletcher knows exactly who Tess is and he's now in a rock and a hard spot.  He wants to help but first he has to fess up to what his day job really is.  Hello mayor Fletcher!<br /><br />These were great stories, very steamy (like you're used to with any Lori Foster or Erin McCarthy reads)  Morgan Leigh is also a great author and one I look forward to reading again, and a great addition to the 'Bad Boys' line.  Pick this up for your summer reading list.  A great beach book, or airport book, or traveling in the car book...you get the picture.<br /><br />Official reviewer for [...]a rock and a hard spot.

It didn't make it onto my keeper shelf (I just don't have that much room since I have to move every three years) but I would recommend it as it is a funny, light read.<br />Alexander Drummond, Marquis of Warrick has a family past that he will live down.  He won't be like his ancestors by seducing the servants.  He's had no problem with this until he comes face to face with Mary.  Mary is a commoner and there to take care of his daughter but he still finds himself thinking about her, dreaming about her...well, you get the picture.<br />Mary may be a commoner but she is anything but common.  Actually she's a trick ride for a circus who just so happens to have a pet monkey Abu and now no thanks to her good for nothing father a nurse for a real little brat.  Oh, yeah her boss is making her think things a proper young lady should never think.  Never mind that the words that come out of her mouth are rather...colorful!<br />Can two different people find love despite their station in life?<br />Colorful characters as well as a different and fun plot made this a fun light read.  I highly recommend Ms. Britton as an author to add to your summer reading list.	2004-06-02

This was a well written gothic romance by a very talented and new voice.  I look forward to reading Ms. Tyrrel again in the future.<br />In the style of old gothic romances from the past Ms. Tyrrel takes us to the Sierra Nevada mountains to a beautiful turn of the century manor that needs more then it's fair share of repairs.  But there is more then meets the eye when it comes to the house on the edge of the woods.  There's a mystery that Architect Stacy Addison walks into when she purchases her dream house.  Someone is stalking her and making threatning phone calls.  She starts experiencing accidents and other scary incidents.  She trys to play it off but she can't help but think that Brand Vandevere her neighbor, that also wanted the manor house is up to no good, and that he may be behind the calls and accidents.  Problem with that is Stacy can't help but feel drawn to the handsome but secretive man.  Is he just what he seems or is he more?  Who is trying to scare her and why?<br />This was a fun read one that kept me glued to the pages.  Ms. Tyrrel has a very sensual way of writing.  Her characters are engaging and fun and at the same time you truly never really feel as if you know them.  I highly recommend this read and suggest that you add this to your summer reading list.	2004-05-31

Finally another author not afraid to include historic details in her historical romance.  After all isn't that the reason many of us read historicals opposed to other genre's?<br />This was a wonderful story and as I stated earlier full of rich historic details and great characters.  I truly felt that I was with Helena of York on her quest to find her father's killer brought to justice.  While doing this she treads a fine line between two different kings and one man that knows her secret, and one man she finds is her strength and her love.<br />Stephen is Count Dinan from Normandy.  King Richard has turned his back on him and now he is known as the Black Knight.  While in Oxford during a council meeting he finds himself drawn to the beautiful Isolde of Brittney.  Stephen knows that Isolde is not what she appears to be.  He once played with the young Isolde and the beauty before him is not the little girl he played with.  Soon he finds himself drawn to Helena and he makes a promise to always be there for her no matter what.  Little did he know that he was actually going to pay a price larger then he ever thought he would and that he would do it again if it would keep Helena safe.  Together the work to find a traitor and killer.<br />The chemistry between the two main characters is wonderful.  It doesn't detract from the story and in fact only adds to it. You can tell that the author did her homework on York and Oxford.  I have lived in England previously and have visited both of these wonderful cities.  Ms. Cooper-Posey did justice to them both.  Not to mention the fact that I loved that she included the myth of Robin Hood. But the most important part of any historical is actual historic figures being included.  Again Ms. Cooper-Posey gets added points for including both King Richard and his brother John as part of the colorful cast of characters, as well as creating wonderful secondary characters that are very much a part of the story.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves rich details, and a wonderful story that will pull you into the time period.  The romance is wonderful and well written. Ms.Cooper-Posey is a truly talented author and one that I will look forward to reading again in the future!ook to anyone that loves rich details, and a wonderful story that will pull you into the time period.

I admit to being somewhat a snob when it comes to the sub-genre of time-travel romance.  I have a few authors that I'll read but for the most part I normally overlook this particular genre due to the fact that seldom are they done well.  This book blew me away.  Not only did Ms. Rosburg pen a wonderful romance she was very creative in the way she introduced the time travel theme.<br />Steve Bellingham is being tormented by a dream that always end with the death of the woman in his arms.  For years he has been suffering and no one seems to be able to help him in the medical community.  His sister mentions Millie a person she thinks will be able to help him.  Millie will help him regress back to his past life and hopefully this will end the dream.  Steve doesn't believe in past lives but is willing to do anything at this point to end the depression and other sad feelings he has been experiencing since the onset of the dream.  He is totally blown away when the regression seems to work.  He goes back in time to the period of the rule of Henry III.  Here he finds the love of his life, his soul mate and together they battle the same enemy.  But can Steven change the past this time around and protect the one woman he's sworn to love and protect?<br />This book was so well written that I found myself transported back in time along with Steven.  I totally fell in love with all of the characters and found myself laughing and crying along with them.  This is the second time  I've read this book and it really only gets better.  I highly recommend this book as well as this author to anyone if there interested in a well crafted story that will move your emotions.	2004-05-25

I love turn of the century romances and there are few of them to be had out in the romance market.  Ms. Ryan's &quot;The Last Dance&quot; hooked me from page one and made it to my &quot;keeper&quot; shelf.  Set in Atlantic City Ms. Ryan spins a sweet story about a straight laced young lady from a small upstate New York village, and a devil may care rake from New York City.  This is a perfect example of the old saying &quot;opposites attract.&quot;<br />Lucy is going to finally live a little.  She has been saving and has planned to go to Atlantic City for a fun two week visit where she plans on meeting a gentleman she has been writing to for several years.  Lucy makes her way to the fun city by the ocean totally unaware that Theodore Mooney will not be joining her.  She then makes the mistake of thinking Blackie is her gentleman.  What happens from there is the building of a relationship that will change both Lucy and Blackie in ways they never thought possible.<br />This was a very well written romance with wonderful characters both primary and secondary.  The setting is truly unique and again well written.  I found myself transported to the turn of the century Atlantic City and all the wonders that are found there.  Ms. Ryan is a truly gifted storyteller and I highly recommend this book.  If your in the middle of planing your summer reading list you will miss out on a story that will make you laugh, cry, and believe in romance if you leave this one off your list.  Now that would be a shame!	2004-05-22

Ms. Gardner has penned yet again another fast-paced, edge or your seat thriller that you will be hard pressed to put down until you've managed to read the final page.  Ms. Gardner manages to maintain the momentum in her latest thriller as well as keep you guessing who the deranged serial killer is until the final chapter.<br />Ms. Gardner brings back Special Agent Pierce Quincy, sassy, Rainie and Pierce's daughter Kim in her latest book.  Kim is now on her way to being the FBI agent she always wanted to be.  Problem is she is driven to be a super agent for all the wrong reason.  She can't get past the fact that she blames herself for the death of her mother and sister at that hands of a man that she trusted and brought home to the family.  On top of that her relationship with her father is strained at best.  She keeps everyone at arms length and it's starting to effect her performance during her training.  Then one day she makes a gruesome discovery.  She finds a body on the FBI grounds during a PT run.  This opens a whole new can of worms and she is drawn into investigating this crime with another law enforcement officer Micheal Mac McCormack together they will track down a sick killer and hopefully save the day for his young victim.<br />Mac has been tracking a killer for many years.  He killed for awhile during a summer heat wave and then just dropped off the face of the earth.  He knows the killer is still out there and goes to Quantico and FBI headquaters to get some much needed help.  It seems the killer is getting ready to kill again.  Someone has been calling him and playing riddle word games with him and he is not about to lose this game and another innocent victim.  Can Mac and Kim figure out his clues in time to save the next victim?<br />This is a well crafted book.  The fact that Ms. Gardner brings back old characters from past books only addes to the characterization of the story.  This is very much Kim's story and her father plays only a small part but it's fun to see Pierce again.  I highly recommend this book and this author as well if your interested in edge of your seat, keep you guessing books.  This will make a perfect addition to your Summer reading list.but it's fun to see Pierce again.

First off I must admit to not being totally swept away with the new genre &quot;Chick-Lit&quot; as few of the books I've managed to read really spoke to me.  Ms. Cabot's latest though is really an exception to the rule.  She has managed to take our current lifestyle (computers, IMing, e-mail...) and shows us how it really can be used as a vehicle for story telling.  Now I have not read the first book in this series but trust me I will be adding it to my shopping cart as soon as I'm done with this review.<br />This book offers laugh out loud moments, fun and crazy characters, and a fun storyline.  Ms. Cabot is truly a talented author and I found this book fun to read (e-mails, office announcements, and IM'ing as well as Kate's journal entries).  I look forward to Ms. Cabot's next adult effort and highly recommend her for a light hearted, good time read!	2004-05-17

Mr. Bohjalian writes from a female POV and on top of that manages to do a fair job on it.  Who says a male can't understand the female mind?  The writing was a bit simplistic but I feel that this was due to the fact that at times we were looking on at the events of the story from a child and then eventually a teenagers POV.  They are not going to be as articulate as an adult.  In this I feel that Mr. Bohjalian is true to the character.<br />This story as stated earlier is from the POV of Connie.  Connie is an adult that looks back on a situation that effected who she was and would become not only as a woman but as a professional.  Connie's mom is arrested and tried after a home-birth that ends in the death of the laboring mother.  What follows is a little look at one side of this tragic event that was not only thought provoking but moving.<br />I found myself pulled in from the very beginning and as a result I read this book in one day.  This book doesn't beat up on Midwives or the choice of home-birthing.  Nor is this book scary or overly graphic in nature.  Mr. Bohjalian is a very talented author and I feel that he has done justice to this topic.  The characters that make up this story are just as important as the storyline itself.<br />I must admit that I'm not much of a book club reader instead I read books that interst me so I have not jumped on the &quot;bookclub bandwagon&quot; but I found this book to really be the exception.	2004-05-17

Ms. Davidson is fast becoming a very entertaining author in the romantic comedy genre.  Although this has not been my favorite by this author I was still entertained.<br />In the latest offering of Ms. Davidson she takes a &quot;might have been&quot; approach and turns Alaska into it's own country with its own monarchy.  Christina is a down on her luck American that happens to run into the King of Alaska and manages to amuse him enough that he offers her a place to stay with the hope that she will appeal to his son David the heir apparent.  The man needs to get married!  What follows is a fun look at the American take on royalty and the developing relationship between two people that are total opposites!<br />There are some moments that are not too terribly funny and the joke fell flat or perhaps Christina was being too obnoxious and to irrelevant for the situation (remember we are talking about a royal family here) and would detract from the story.  Thankfully these were few and far between.<br />For a laugh out loud read that will entertain you for a day you can't beat Ms. Davidson.	2004-05-15

Who dosen't love a cowboy?  In my opinion Ms. Martin combines just the right amout of suspense, and the right amount of information surrounding rodeo to make this a page turning read.  The chemistry between Dallas and Patience was wonderful and Ms. Martin developed their relationship slowly but I feel that this added to their romance.  There is a good suspense storyline.  Patience is being stalked and when she escapes to the west in order to follow the rodeo circuit for her dissertation she thinks she has left her problems behind.  Problem is it looks as if she may have jumped from the frying pan into the fire.  The Circle C Rodeo seems to be plauged by accidents and it's not long before Dallas and Patience are caught right in the middle.<br />Secondary characters as well as secondary storylines are entertaining and in no way detract from the main storyline of Dallas and Patience.  I can hardly wait for the next in this series and highly recommend this read until the mean time.	2004-05-15

Afia Jake, Rudy, and Jean Pierre are the greatest set of characters that I've read in a very long time.  This book offers laugh out loud moments and I loved the chemistry between Afia and Jake.  This book is a must read for anyone that loves contemporary romance and laughter.<br />The storyline is unique and fun.  Afia was born on Friday 13th.  She has lost not only her father but two of her husband in totally weird accidents and to top it all off, she has lost all of her money due to her business manager stealing it.  What's a girl to do now?  She looks for a job.  Enter Jake.  Jake is a P.I. who has been called in by Afia's godfather.  He has to leave and he wants Afia to be watched and taken care of.  She is used to a much more cushy lifestyle and he feels it would be safer for her (she is a tad bit accident prone...okay more then a tad) and he knows that Jake is the man for the job.<br />Afia doesn't realize it but she's with Jake for a reason.  She has decided with the help of her gay best-friend Rudy who has turned to self-help books that it's time to take control of her life.  This means finding a job, getting her money back, and stop thinking of herself as Jinxed.  It won't be easy to undo a lifetime of thinking but for some reason Jake gives her the strength to do just that.  What she can't believe is how attracted she is to Jake.  First off he's not old enough to be her father, he's not gay, and he is not rich.  Instead he's yummy with a capital Y!!!  And the way he jumps start her heart!!!  Together they are working a case of Jake's that prove to Afia that she is capable and not the walking catastrophe.<br />This was such a fun book.  I was so sorry to see the end of the story and having to say goodbye to these fun characters.  Ms. Ciotta's make believe world was a fun one and I can hardly wait for her next book!  The secondary storyline that involves Rudy is also fun as is the relationship between Rudy and Afia.  As stated earlier the chemistry between Jake and Afia is wonderful as well as the way Ms. Ciotta developed their relationship.

Ms. Wolfe has penned a book that has it all, and I mean all!!  A little sci-fi (breeding a meta-human), paranormal (psychic abilities), suspense, action, and great characterization.  There is even a little bit of romance but before you go eww[...] very much a sideline storyline and no sex scenes to sidetrack you.<br />Shelby is not your typical female character.  She is bold, strong, and very capable.  She is out to rescue Shannon and her son Sam from \\"The Center\\" and nothing and no one will stop her from reaching her goal.  She is a former FSA agent and she has been called back to perform this OP by her old handler.  She is sucessful in the fact that she gets into \\"The Center\\" and manages to not only rescue Shannon, and Sam but also Zoe.  Of course she dosen't just waltz in and waltz out, she uses her great ability at disguise and other things she learned while working for the FSA to make this happen and again this is not the end of the story.  Add to this Mac a great looking Aussie that has become to her dismay a partner (she has issues about working with anyone, fact is she doesn't work with anyone at all and if that is not enough she finds herself in her sleep wrapping herself around him and finding him very yummy) he is also working the case from the side of the FBI. There is the added danger that comes from her old handler at FSA headquarters, her conversations seem to lead the bad guys right to her, she knows the Ethan could not possibly be the leak but she can't avoid the fact that the bad guys seem to be in the know as far as safe-houses and rescues.  Who is the mole in the FSA? They need to find out before this person manages to ruin everything.<br />This was an extremly fast-paced read that managed to maintain it's momentum throughout the entire novel.  I made the mistake of thinking it would be a great book to read on my way home from Germany.  Well, it was in fact so good that I managed to drop my responsiblity of reading the map and my husband and I saw a little more of Germany then we planned!  I can hardly wait for the next book by this author.  For a debut novel this is strong and shows that Ms. Wolfe has great potential and she has quite the imagination as well.

She was not a wishy-washy character but rather a strong person who was able to make the most of her weekend in Paris.<br />I do agree though with one former reviewer with the fact that I was also a little let down by the part of the storyline that revolved around her finally finding her father.  I felt as if we were left hanging.  Why bring it up if there was not going to be any follow through????  Other wise this was a light read and a fun way to pass the weekend.	2004-05-11

I love storylines where the main characters share a history that goes way back.  This is true for this book where our heroine is the daughter of an Earl and her love interest is a servant that worked in the stable.  They started out as the best of friends trying to forget the fact that it was not a proper relationship and that it could never go any farther.  Despite the fact that they could never share their lives as husband and wife their feeling for each other grow until they both admit that they love each other.  McKenna knows that Aline is out of his reach but he would do anything to stay close to her.  Despite the care that they take in order to spend time together they are spotted and the Earl is told of the meeting.  McKenna is sent away thinking that Aline never cared for him, and Aline is left behind mourning the only man she will ever love.<br />Years later McKenna returns to Aline as a wealthy American bent on revenge.  He never slept with her as a teen he is going to fix that mistake.  Of course McKenna is not aware of the truth that sent him away, nor is he aware of the tragedy that befell Aline not long after he left.  What he was also not planning on was the fact that his feelings for Aline have never gone away.  He still finds that he loves her despite what he thinks that she has done.<br />Aline has never forgotten McKenna and the man that he has grown to become is just as handsome and desirable as the young man he had been.  She knows that he wants his revenge and she is willing to let him have it if it means that she will be in his arms once again.<br />This was such a moving story and I was totally drawn into it from the very beginning.  There is the secondary storyline that involves her sister and McKenna's business parter that is equally moving.  This story has all of the trademark Kleypas sensualtiy as well as the wonderfully crafted characters and storyline.  This story had me reaching for my kleenex on more then one occassion.  For a wonderful senual read you can't beat Ms. Kleypas.rful senual read you can't beat Ms. Kleypas.	2004-05-11

I truly loved this book Ms. Phillips has managed to pen yet another sweet novel that is not too sweet but at the same time touching and completly unforgettable.<br />Sugar Beth is a very complex character that I must admit to not thinking I would like.  I thought \\"how can I read this book when the heroine is so totally nasty, spitful, and mean?\\".  But trust me, you will end up liking this woman after you get to know her through Ms. Phillips clever writing.  This book has many secondary character's that are totally revelant to the story and in fact there is a secondary storyline between Winnie (related to Sugar Beth) and Winnie's husband Ryan (Sugar Beth's high school sweetheart) that is also entertaining. And lets not forget our hero Colin.  This story is set in the South in Mississippi a place that I called home for three years long ago, and Ms. Phillip's writing brought me back to what it was like to live in a small southern town. Not the spitfulness of it but the sense of community. This is a story that will have you turning the pages simply because you want to find out if there is such a thing as a \\"happily ever after\\" for Sugar Beth, and if forgiveness can be obtained by her as well for the way she treated her old friends from long ago.  Who says that you can't go home again.  This is truly a story about forgiveness, and growing and one that I hope you will pick up.	2004-05-05

Her latest novel managed to combine, wit, humor, suspense, drama, and of course steamy romantic feelings between Reese and Derek or heroine and hero.<br />These are not perfect characters and I think this was one of the reason's why I liked them so much.  Reese is a &quot;little spoiled aspiring for a real by-line reporter&quot;, and Derek is a &quot; I better not screw this one up or else my brilliant FBI agent career is memorex&quot; kind of guy.  Despite these flaws these two characters really shine and their chemistry and growing relationship is HOT!!!  Basically you have a mix up when an informate to a big case that Derek has been working on for a long time leaves his information in the wrong car. The car just so happens to be the rental car that Reese has contracted out for her stay in the windy city while she covers a society wedding. Could her life be more boring?  Not for long, before either one of them knows it they have both found what they haven't been looking for and  nothing will be the same.<br />This was a fun, fast paced read that as stated earlier combines great characterization, fun plotting, and great chemistry between the two main characters.  This read is quite sensual but not over done, and certainly not used as page filler. Plenty of laugh out loud moments as well as some great secondary characters that I feel may just call out for their own story.  Ms. McCarthy is now an author I will purchase simply because her name is on the cover.  Who said you can't judge a book by it's cover?	2004-05-03

I am a huge fan of this very talented author and found her latest paperback to be highly engaging.  This was really more in my opinion a mainstream suspense novel with romantic tones then an outright romantic suspense.  What's the difference you ask?  This was not a romance book with a suspense storyline as the vehicle for Ashley and Jake to fall in love with each other.  Instead Ms. Graham concentrated on the murder/mystery/suspense of a five year old case that had been &quot;solved&quot;.  Problem is there has been a new murder that lookes to much like the ones from five years earlier.  Is the wrong man in jail, or is he calling the shots from his prison cell?<br />The characters in this story are great.  There are many secondary characters that make up the world that Ashley, and Jake both live in.  I feel that they are really all part and parcel of the story.  There are a few misleads and red herrings but in the end I was still surprised by just who the bad guy was.  Again this was not a strong romantic story.  The relationship between Ashley and Jake is not an in-depth one but I felt the chemistry that was between them from the get go.  Don't expect &quot;Classic Heather Graham&quot;  I think this is just a good example of how this author is growing and changing and perhaps reaching out to a larger readership.  I for one am along for the ride to see where she takes us next.	2004-05-03

This is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Vreeland and I found her topic and storytelling to be very entertaining and very descriptive.  This story tracks the path of a painting thought to have been created by Vermeer and we follow it from present day to back to the day it was created.  This is really a story that is made up of several short stories each standing on it's own and the different effects this one painting had on each owner.  I found this to be a very entertaing read and look forward to reading my by this very talented author!	2004-04-29

Well, first off I should mention that I make it a regular habit (not on purpose mind you!) to read series out of order.  I pick up a book read the back cover and think &quot;hey this sounds great&quot; only to be maybe two chapters in only to find out I'm reading book 3 out of 4!  Well, this time is no different and I still found that yes, I want to read the next book in the series and even more important the first book.  With that said this is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Hamilton and I found her writing to be very entertaining and her little world to be fun.  Merry continues on in her quest to not only remain alive (despite her cousin's attempts on her life), but to try and conceive the future heir of the sidhe.  With her bodyguards, Doyle, Frost, and Rhys, as well as goblin Kitto we follow this very sassy princess as she does her best to walk a very thin line between two different rulers.  If you are not a fan of fantasy (like me) I still think you will find Ms. Hamilton's fantasy world fun and a worth while way to pass the time	2004-04-28

This series manages to just keep getting better and better.  In Ms. Kenyon's latest addition to the DH series we meet Wulf.  A Viking that is a Dark Hunter but not.  He has survived for centuries with no one remembering him five minutes after he leaves their presence.  That's all about to change when he meets Cassandra.  Problem with Cassandra is he has sworn to kill her kind (she's Appollite) and now with the help of the Gods and orders from Ash he now finds himself protecting that which he has hunted.  Of course Cassandra is half human so it should be okay that he is now feeling intense things for her and there is the added bonus that she remembers him.<br />We learn more about the DH legend in this story as well as getting to know the Appollite's as well.  They are more then people that might turn Daimon.  This story was very touching at times (I even managed to tear up a few times) as well as sensual.  Ms. Kenyon has an incredible imagination and is not afraid to use it.  Julian, Zarak, Ash, Talon, and Kyrian all play a part in this story.  I would really be hard pressed to pick my favorite story since they are all different and lets face it so far all of the DH are yummy!  If you are new to this series you will find this book very entertaining, and if you have been following it from the beginning such as I have you won't want to miss this story!!!  I can hardly wait for the next in the series.  Ms. Kenyon truly can't write it fast enough for me!	2004-04-26

This is a great series published by Brava and so far none of them have let me down.<br />This is the first in which my favorite Ms. Foster does not have a short story included.  Despite this this book is well worth reading.  I'm not going to go into great detail on the sysnopsis of each story since that has already been done and done well at that.  In any event Ms. McKenna's (who is on my automatic buying list) short story was my favorite and I can only hope has plans with will include the rest of Mac's family (hint, hint...) sooner rather than later.  With that said I must go on record that none of the stories in this anthology are weak.  All of them are real strong, with great characters (yummy alpha male heros, not taking any sass heroines!) and fun storylines.  And they are all three steamy in their own right.  For a fast but fun read you can't go wrong with any of the &quot;Bad Boy&quot; series!!!	2004-04-23

Ms. Williams clearly has a great sense of humor and is not afraid to use it.  Ellie, Daphne, Minnow, Gus, Amy, Hugh, Jacinta, Ben, Doug and the rest of the cast of characters (yes, there are just a few more) really make for a fun read.<br />Ellie and Minnow meet one night at a happen club and it's lust at first sight.  But that's the problem.  Ellie has just been dumped by Ben and can't get her ex-boyfriend out of her mind.  She then meets Minnow thinks, yes, he's eyecandy but probably to young.  Anyhow the night ends with a kiss and a rather funny lie.  Ellie tells Minnow the reason why she can't go home with him is because she has a kid...goodbye eye candy.  Fear of commitment is really a horrid thing!<br />Well, this just starts off a hugh chain of events that incompasses all of the friends of the a forementioned characters.  This is truly a book that proves just how small a world it is.  This book had many laugh out loud moments and was as I stated earlier a fast paced read not to mention a light read.  Take a break and head down under to the land of Oz and visit for awhile with a great set of characters.	2004-04-23

From the very first page I was drawn into this very entertaining story of a young girls coming of age and eventually taking her place as a renowned Geisha.  Mr. Golden's writing style is through and attention grabbing.  Although this is a work of fiction and not in fact a true memoir this is still a very well written novel and one that I would highly recommend to anyone.	2004-04-23

Again she manages to bring history back to the historical romance genre with another emotional read that will touch on all levels of emotion.  This time we visit Ireland and the turbulant time in which the struggle of the Irish is an everyday occurance with the ruling English class that has taken over.<br />I won't go into a long descriptive summary regarding plot.  Suffice to say Jamie (we met him in Ms. Clare's first novel) a member of the landed gentry and Protestant finds himself drawn to Brighid a peasent Irish lass that has all of the spirit and pride of her heritage as well as a deep desire to find a man to love and care for.  These two are destined to find love but it will not be a smooth path and there will be many that will do all that they can to keep these apart.<br />Ms. Clare again proves that she has taken time to research the time period as well as the various problems that would have arisen as a result of religious issues of the time.  The characters (both main and secondary) are all important to the telling of the story.  Kuddos again to Ms. Clare for not shying away from adding true historic details in the telling of her story.  As a result of this you are in for a very rich and deep story that will cause you to laugh, cry, and cheer for a happy ending.  I have now added Ms. Clare to my must read list and highly recommend her to anyone who loves history and romance that at times can by sensual in their historical romance!	2004-04-21

Her latest effort is a very sweet story with a &quot;Robin Hood&quot; theme that involves interesting characters, wonderful chemistry between Merrick and Chloe, and the added bonus of getting a sequal out of the entire deal.<br />This was a fast read and one that was entertaining.  I look forward to Ian's story and highly recommend this read to anyone.	2004-04-18

I found this book to be rather disturbing and emotional to the point that I would put it down only to pick it up again based on the fact that so many of my friends found it a good read.  I admit that the idea of a young girl narrating from her idea of what Heaven is was a good one.  Watching her family and the trials they go through after her murder was a different way to show us how death effects different people.  With that said I must admit that I had a hard time caring how Mom, sister Lindsay, and the rest of the motley crew felt or how the death of susie affected the different characters in the end.  Susie's mom was probably the most unlikeable character in my opinion, and I wanted to like her since I am also a mother and could not imagine for one second how I would feel if one of my children was taken from me in such a violent way.  The way she just shut down on everyone (including her two other children) and turned to the police detective was in my opinion what turned me off to her.<br />Still I continued to read this book only to be totally let down by the ending.  I hope my next read by this author is not such a let down.	2004-04-18

This is the first time I have read one of her older books.  Previously I've only read were her SEAL team books.  This book on the other hand went much deeper and really delved into a very touchy subject and that is substance abuse.<br />In &quot;Heart Throb&quot; our hero is a recovering alcoholic and prescription drug abuser.  This is so different from the &quot;perfect&quot; hero that we normally find in the romance genre.  As a result we are able to see what kind of conflict comes from this kind of life.  Jed or Jericho is not perfect in life, but he had been perfect on the big screen.  Then he hit rock bottom and finds that his ticket back to the A list in a movie called &quot;The Promise&quot;.  Problem is the producer of the movie Kate does not trust him as far as she can throw him.  This is her movie and even though Jericho is the real life version of her hero on screen she can't run the risk that he will ruin everything by taking a drink.  Kate's problem though is she finds herself attracted to Jericho and she knows that this could be the biggest mistake of her life is she allows herself to act on those feelings.<br />Ms. Brockmann does not tie up this romance all nice with a pretty bow.  She allows both of them to experience a wide range of feelings one of which is mistrust on Kate's part.  She would not be true to real feelings if this issue was ignored.  As a result this was a much deeper romance and as a result of this much better.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is not afraid to have a touchy topic as a backdrop for a story.	2004-04-17

Ms. Chevalier is another author that I will pick up simply because her name is on the cover.  This was a very interesting read given the fact that I love the time period that the story was set in (end of Victoria's reign, beginning of Edward's) and the way the story was told from several characters POV.  This is a story about change and how we live our life.  It was truly entertaining and I look forward to more work by Ms. Chevalier.	2004-04-16

Her stories are complex involve many different storylines (this one has 3), and always interesting characters!<br />In Ms. Holt's latest Olivia Hopkins is being forced into seeking a marriage proposal from the Earl of Salisbury in order to save her her stepmother, stepsister, and cousin by marriage, as well as the (...) daughter of her brother from ruin.  Not a small matter considering the fact that she has fallen in love with the Earl's (...) son Phillip.  Phillip is everything she could love in a man except that he does not have the means to take care of all of her family.<br />When Phillip first meets Olivia looking at a very scandalous book he sees a chance to hurt his father.  What happens in reality is that he is drawn to her goodness and heart.  He can't believe how attracted he is to her.  Now he must look the other way since he knows why Olivia is there at his father's estate, and he knows that he can't help.  While these two fight for a love they know they can't have they are also having to deal with Olivia's nasty stepmother and stepsister.  They both have an agenda that they will move heaven and earth to obtain.  Caught in the middle will be the Earl of Salisbury and Winnie.<br />This was a great story.  The characters were great and the chemistry between Olivia and Phillip as well as Earl of Salisbury and Winnie was explosive.  This is a must read you won't want to miss!	2004-04-16

I love the fact that Ms. Eschenburg was not afraid to add history to her historical romance.  In this story our hero and heroine come to terms with life and love with the Civil War as a backdrop for their story.  This story in many ways reminded me of the old classic &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; in the fact that the time period was the same, pre civil war to the call of arms and the &quot;excitement&quot; that was felt by so many during this time period.<br />Royce and Annabelle's story takes place in pre-war Virginia and they are forced into a marriage that does not seem like it will have a happy ending.  It's really a deal made between Royce and his father with Annabelle caught in the middle.  As both of these strong people come to terms with what life has dealt them, they are also facing the coming storm both realizing that war won't be glorious but that it's a foregone conclusion.  Despite this they fall in love and their love story is wonderful.  Full of all kinds of emotion.<br />Secondary characters only enrich this already wonderful story.  This is the first time that I've read Ms. Eschenburg but it won't be the last.	2004-04-14

The main character in Ms. Bushnell's story &quot;Trading Up&quot; is one of the most annoying character's that I've read in a long time.  I liked her somewhat in the story &quot;4 Blondes&quot; but she is shallow, and very selfish.  I found this a difficult book to enjoy since the main character was such a snot and the nasty way she used people and treated people that were close to her, never mind how she treated and used people that were simply in her way also became rather tedious.<br />I found that although the overall story about improving ones life through social connections could have been fun this one just really fell short of the mark.  IF on the other hand you like shallow, self involved characters then this is the book for you.	2004-04-14

This is the first time that I've ever read anything by Ms. Heller and I found this book to be very amusing.  This book is not brain surgery and is without a doubt considered a light read.  This is the reason I picked up this book and I was not let down.<br />Ms. Heller has managed to combine not only fun and interesting characters, interesting storylines, and humor into fast and enjoyable read.<br />Alison Waxman Koff has hit rock bottom.  Her second husband has decided to leave her for his first wife, not only that but they are totally broke after the stockmarket crash.  Alison now must put her life back together, find a way to keep the bank from foreclosing on her house, and at the same time find a way to hold her head high.  Finding a job is not turning out to be the easist thing in the world!  Add to this a mother who is not the warmest person in the world, a wise cracking hunk that Alison wishes she could forget, and a murder and you have the makings for this fun book.<br />As stated earlier this is a very light read.  Alison and Cullie (the wise cracking hunk) are great character's and the mystery surrounding the murder victim is actually interesting and fun.  Ms. Heller manages to add a few twists and turns before the actual murdered is unvailed.  For an easy read you really can't go wrong with &quot;Cha Cha Cha.&quot;	2004-04-11

In this the last novel in the series we see Lucinda finally getting her chance to fall in love with a totally wonderful hero named Robert Carroway.  Without going into a long synopsis suffice it to say this is a very moving story of a worn torn hero who finally gets a chance to heal in more ways then one with the woman that helps him live again.<br />Ms. Enoch brings back all of her past hero's and heroine's as well as introducing us to a few new characters.  This was such a fun series I'm sorry to see it end.  Unlike many series that taper off as the stories are added, Ms. Enoch manages to keep the momentum going by giving us such wonderful and diverse characters as well as touching storylines that you can't help but be drawn to the book.	2004-04-09

First off I really think that this is more of a mainstream paranormal novel (do those exist before now??) and less of a romance. I also am very careful about which vampire books I read.  Some just don't do it for me.  Ms. Davidson has been added to my &quot;safe list&quot;.  Actually she tops it now!<br />Without going into the whole story lets just suffice it to say that the character's in this book are great, Ms. Davidson's sense of humor and wit is great, and she has managed to mix both of these concepts into a fast paced read that will literally having you laughing out loud and more then once.  Yes, she even manages to mix in a little sensuality with your vampire's as well as adding her own spin on the whole vampire myth/legend.  Trust me you have not read a vampire book like this one.  EVER!!!  I truly look forward to the next in this series.  Ms. Davidson can't write fast enough for me...So hurry Ms. Davidson, Hurry!!	2004-04-08

Ms. Low is fast becoming one of my favorite suspense romance authors!!!  Her fast paced, steamy romance, and page turning suspense are not your typical suspense type read.  Ms. Low combines, spy action, spy suspense, and yummy hero's in such a way you will be hard pressed to put the book down until you've reach the final page!  I can only say that I am waiting not so patiently for her next read!<br />In &quot;Facing Fear&quot; Nikki our heroine is working toward finding her past.  All she knows was that she was a government agent that was left behind during a mission gone bad.  She has very little memory of who she was and as a result, has made a deal to do one more mission with the end result being she finds out who she really is.  This seems like an easy task but there are many challenges, and fears that she must face.  One is CIA Operations Chief Rick Harden.  She has a connection to him but how?<br />Rick is under a microscope yet again.  His boss has just been captured selling government secrets, an undercover SEAL agent has been responsible for finding the mole in the TIARA office.  Rick is saavy enough to realize that he will also be considered a possible leak.  Now not only does he have to decide if he wants to do anything to salvage what's left of his career, he now finds himself drawn to Nikki the one person he knows it out to get him...but how?  Nikki strongly reminds him of his dead wife and she has touched him in such a way that he begins to feel protective of her.  This could only mean more trouble.<br />This was as I stated earlier a very fast-paced read.  There are so many twists and turns that you have no real idea who the traitor is until the end.  Rick is beyond your typical tall, dark, and yummy hero and is a real treat for readers as a result.  The chemistry between Rick and Nikki is explosive and hot!  If you love edge of your seat reading do yourself a favor and pick up Ms. Low!!!	2004-04-08

Cowboy and his team are on a resuce mission.  One of the people they rescue is Melody.  Melody puts her life literally in Cowboy's hands.  What they both can't explain nor expected was the instant attraction they both felt.  After the rescue is complete these to act on their mutal attraction neither realizing that this is not the end but the beginning for both of them.<br />The character's were great and although at times Melody did get on my nerve's with her reluctance to even take the time to get to know Cowboy (one of her reason's for not marrying him was because she did not &quot;know&quot; him outside of the bedroom) eventually these two people come to an understanding not only about themselves but their individual place in the world.  Sounds cheesey I know but still that's how it turned out.  The whole team is present in this book so you get to visit with old friends as well getting to know other secondary characters.  This is a fast paced read I;n sure you'll enjoy!	2004-04-05

I realize that it's billed as a &quot;romantic suspense&quot; but trust me there is hardly any romance to be found in these pages so those of you that are scared off by the idea of romance will be safe in picking up this title.<br />There were a lot of character's but I don't think there were so many that one could not keep track of what was going on.  Really I feel that each character did play it's part in the telling of the story.<br />Someone is going around killing people by burying them alive with a dead corpse.  Why?  How are they connected?  These are the questions that haunt Detective Pierce Reed.  From the beginning the killer later dubbed &quot;The Grave Robber&quot; draws Reed into his horrid game.  Reed knows the first victim.  Now it's a race against the clock to catch this killer before he kills again.<br />Nikki Gillette is a hard core journalist.  She is after the story that will break and at the same time make her career.  She has a bad blemish on her record so she has to work twice as hard to prove that she can get the job done.  While working on local interest stuff she also works at trying to scoop not only her co-worker but the competition by getting all the information regarding the Grave Robber.  Of course she is also in communication with the killer.  He has a bone to pick with her as well.  Soon this hard core newspaper journalist, and the tough as nails detective find that they have more in common then they thought.  A Killer to be exact.<br />Nikki was an obnoxious character at times and yes, this did get on my nerves after a time.  Still the twists and turns that Ms. Jackson took us on was well worth one of her annoying characters.  Ms. Jackson is well on her way to becoming a mainstream suspense novelist.	2004-04-05

Ms. Chevalier has done it again taking a historic work of art and creating a believable story to how this painting came about.<br />Ms. Chevalier has a very lyrical way of writing that is not only vividly descriptive, but also draws you into 17th century Delft.  I managed to read this book in one sitting since the story of Griet and her sensual awakening which is triggered by her going to work as a maid for an artist and his family was totally captivating.<br />For a fast read that is truly a work of art in it's own write you can't go wrong with anything written by Ms. Chevalier!	2004-04-02

Since I live abroad I thought this would be a fun book...and it was up to a point.  First off Ms. Johnson knows her French no doubt about it...I on the other hand am not completely fluent so I had to pull out my trusty French phrase dictionary! This was needed since there were so many French words, phrases, and complete paraghraphs in French that were not translated I thought I would miss something  and the author does not do this for you.  This did not impress me in the least.  If anything it annoyed me.<br />The characters were...unique but in my opinion unlikeable and at times literally stupid!  Young girl has raving affair with a man old enough to be her granfather, she refuses to even try to pick up the language in her new home country, lots of references to Bosnia and other war type conflicts used I think just to help move the book from point A to point B.  Otherwise these historic events were not necessary except to get across certain character's political statements.  Again very annoying.  And then the constant comparison of how Ameican's are totally clueless!  And then lets not forget the young American married to young Frenchman, have one child together, pregnant with another, and said Frenchman having an affaire.  Oh ya did someone say soap opera?<br />What I did enjoy was the descriptive writing as far as describing a meal or a point of interest such as landmarks, and Paris in general.  I have been to this European city on many occassions and I find it interesting to see how other author's see this city.  Reading about cultural differences was also entertaining since I have run into some of the situation at times while living overseas.  Otherwise unless you are looking to bone up on your conversational French or are really entertained by 'Dynasty' type books then this is for you!  Otherwise borrow it from the library.	2004-04-02

The character's and plot were unique and this was a decent way to pass the time while I was traveling.<br />Duncan is looking for a missing Van Gogh and his quest has brought him to Swiftcurrent Oregon which seems like a sleepy small town but is really anything but.  His first clue is the librarian Alexander Forrest.  She is hot with a capital H!  Ducan and Alex's first meeting is not the coolest meeting and sparks fly between these two very different individuals.<br />Alex likes order, peace, books, and dressing sexy.  What she doesn't like (at least to this point) are smarmy \\"Indiana Jones Wannabe's\\" taking peeks up her skirt while \\"looking\\" for research material.  She totally does not believe that Duncan is a College professor let alone a art buff!  Ya right!!!<br />What brings these two together you ask?  Why a dead body in the  in the home decorating section of the library of course!  Now there is a murder to solve, a painting to find, and Alex doesn't realize it but she may just have all of the clues.  And then of course there is the raging hot chemistry that both Duncan and Alex need to either admit to or....burn up trying to get it out of their system!<br />This was a fun full-length romance that was a nice read.  The character's were quirky, and the storyline was fun.  I at times found myself skimming pages because there were a few slow spots but overall I think this book was good.  Ms. Warren is well on her way to be great author!!!	2004-03-31

This was another fun book by Ms. Hawkins which revolves around that great family the St. Johns.  This is Chase's story and it was well worth the wait.<br />Chase has decided that he must move on from a terrible accident since he can no longer stomach the fact that he has been paying a &quot;friend&quot; to keep quite about a tragic event that took place recently for him.  Feeling that he is not worthy to be called a St. John he decides to not only leave London, but England as well.  On his way to the coast he is set upon by some thievs but is rescued by Harriet.  Now Harriet is nothing like the women that Chase normally finds himself with.  Her voice is sweet, and before he looses conscienceness he can't believe that God has sent an angel to rescue him.<br />Harriet is a no nonsense kind of girl.  Her family has fallen on hard times due to the death of her father, and the bank has been making a lot of noise regarding a loan that was made to said dead father.  Harriet's mom comes up with the idea of stating that Harriet is engaged to a very rich sea captain, and that all of the bank's fears will be put to rest once this handsome, rich captain returns from sea.  Problem is there is no rich captain, and now one of the bank members is starting to question the truth.  Harriet is on her way to market to sell some of their sheep when she and her sister's end up saving Chase.  What follows from there is a great read that will have you chuckling to yourself, as well as rooting for a happy ending for two people that really deserve one.<br />Ms. Hawkins is a great author and I highly recommend any of her reads.  Her love stories are sensual without being too racy.  For a fun read pick up Ms. Hawkins.	2004-03-31

I won't go into the break down of the different plots, but suffice it to say these are all three typical, trademark reads by one of my favorite authors.

This is the second novel that I've read by Ms. Allende and I must say that from the historic point of view I find her work to be wonderful!  She has the ablity to draw a picture with her words that really put you in California during the Gold Rush (I am a native Northern Californian so I am very familiar with this part of our history), as well as really drawing a descriptive picture of life in Chile. This I think is part of Ms. Allende's charm in her writing.<br />As far as characterization goes I find that yes, she does introduce many different characters and yes, it can be confusing at times but still I think it works if you read carefully and not let your mind wander.  I have the insight of having previously read &quot;Portrait In Sepia&quot; so many of these characters (Eliza, Tao Chi'en, and the Sommers) were familiar to me and I loved to read how they came about from the very beginning.  Yes, the ending is abrupt but I really can't see how she could have tied it up with a real pretty bow and not continue on with the their story in &quot;Portrait in Sepia.&quot;<br />This is really more of an epic love story not unlike &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (remember that one also had a rather abrupt ending and people love the book) that covers many aspects of all of the characters lives.  As a result this many not appeal to many readers because the idea of romance is a very large part of the story.  Why this bothers people I don't understand but there you have it.  For a very entertaining read that incorporates historic details as well as deeper characterization then most authors then you can't go wrong with Ms. Allende.	2004-03-29

I found this to be a very good read for those that are fan's of &quot;Chick Lit&quot; and are looking for a deeper kind of read.  This book digs deep and takes a look at how change is a hard thing and how it truly affects a person.  Gert is a sweet heroine who's only fault really are her two friends.  Their shallow, and cynical view of the world and relationships was sad and at time detracted from the story of Gert and how she dealt with the tragic death of her young husband only days before the tragedy of 9/11.  Many author's like to include this historic event in their books and it comes off wrong.  Ms. Lissner manages to tie this event to her storyline in such a moving way that the reader can truly relate to it and perhaps understand the horrors that true victims have had to go through. Imagine loosing the love of your life just with the snap of a finger.  How do you deal with that and move on?<br />The idea of finding love all over again is hard to imagine and the up's and down's of Gert's experience's make up a great story.	2004-03-26

This really was not a 'keeper' due to the fact that I truly had a hard time understanding the main characters.  Ms. Martin has our heroine falling for the WRONG man almost from the get go and if that's not problem enough this carries on through the whole book, I mean right up to the very end! Theresa is hung up on stereotypes and finds fault with just about everything that Mike stands for but does he walk away....no he keeps going back for more. On the other hand she does not look past the shallowness of the guy she's hooked up with and that is tedious in the extreme.<br />Really Theresa was a hard character to like and I found it hard to care one way or another who she ended up with!  Mike who is a very sweet guy keeps messing around with this witch when in reality he's really too good for her. Misunderstandings and lack of communication was the tool used to keep our lovers apart.  Overall it was an okay read.  I enjoyed visiting with Ty and Jenna again, and Mike and other secondary character's were fun.  If you read the first book &quot;Body Check&quot; don't expect the same kind of read this is much different and did not offer the same kind of chemistry or laughs as the previous title. I gave this book 3 stars based on the fact that I found Mike likeable, and his sub plot was good.  Add to that favorites from the previous title kept me turning the pages.	2004-03-26

I thought that this was a great addition to the &quot;American Heiress&quot; series.  The characters were fun and the storyline although done before in other formats was still entertaining.<br />Clara has come to London after a horrid season in New York.  Her sister Sophia has married a Duke and with Sophia and James help she plans on finding a good man to marry.  Circumstance lead her to a ball that she should NOT be attending and this is where we meet Seger.  He is everything that Clara should stay clear of.  Problem is they both find themselves attracted to each other in such a way that they can't help themselves.  Seger is entranced with Clara.  She is a breath of fresh air and his long frozen heart is starting to thaw but can he be the man she wants him to be?<br />This was a fun story that I took with me to the beachs of Spain and despite my location found myself loath to put the book down until the end.  Ms. MacLean manages to pen a very sensual love story without being trite or overblown.  Her characters are rich and fun.  If your a fan of historical romance you will not want to miss this addition to the genre.	2004-03-26

This title was orignially published back in 1995 and the storyline is really a spy/suspense/romance tale that is fast paced and demonstrates that Ms. Gerritsen was well on her way to becoming the author that she is now.<br />This read will take the reader from England to Paris, then on to Greece, and finally Berlin.  The chemistry between Richard Wolf and ex-CIA agent and Beryl the young woman that is trying to figure out who killed her parents and why is really believable but at the same time this relationship did not detract from the spy storyline.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this read.  You won't be sorry.	2004-03-26

Well, my bad, great sun, not so great book. In fact I donated my copy to the hotel library. As you have already probably read the characters are not at all likeable (not one single one!!!), the plot is sad, and in the end there was none of the trademark Gibson humor to see you through.  Do yourself a favor and borrow this one from a friend or buy it second hand.  This is not Ms. Gibson's best effort but I do truly look forward to her next book.

The main characters Anthony and Daphne had a great chemistry that Ms. Guhrke was able to create through a different type of storyline that we seldom see in historical romances without it being to clich&eacute;d.  That storyline is &quot;the handsome Duke, and the not obvious beauty that tames his heart.&quot;<br />Anthony is not sure that he believes in love and does not plan to marry &quot;the love of his life&quot; since he does not think she exists.  He is more interested in opening his museum on Roman artifacts then finding his &quot;true love&quot;.  Everything is going according to plan until Daphne his restorer decides that she would rather go off with his sister (read the book!!) and enjoy polite society, then finish what she started.  Of course this is not a decision that she makes lightly.  She has overheard Anthony what he thinks of her (she's a machine that he needs to fulfill his dream)and now the tender feelings that she had for Tony are now gone....or are they.  What follows is a sweet story of how what you think you want is not exactly how you imagine it, and that the challenge is deciding you may have been wrong.<br />Ms. Guhrke has penned a very sweet read that fans of historical romance will not want to miss.	2004-03-19

Ms. Rose has now become one of the authors that I will buy simply because her name appears on the cover.  This is the second book of hers that I've read and she is an excellent romantic suspense author.  Ms. Rose has managed to deliver an equal amount of suspense and romance without cheating either concept and at the same time keeping you glued to the pages.<br />We met Special Agent Steven Thatcher in Ms. Rose's novel &quot;Don't Tell.&quot;  In this story Steven is investigating a horrific serial murder at the same time trying to balance being a father.  Of course nothing is so easy and his oldest son as been acting out and not doing well in school.  Enter Jenna Marshall, Brad's science teacher.  She is concerned that Brad is not perfoming as he should and makes an appointment to meet with Steven.  From the minute that crash into each other literally their lives are about to be tangled together and nothing will be the same.  Now not only does Steven have to worry about a serial killer that keeps getting more evil each time he kills, it looks like this killer might just have Jenna in his sights.  Can he protect the one woman that he has begun to care about and still catch a killer before he kills again?<br />This is truly an edge of your seat read.  Plenty of twists and turns keep you guess who the killer is until the end of the book, and the chemistry between the two main characters will amaze you.  Secondary character such as Steven's son's and aunt, as well as Jenna's family are only assests to this good read!!!  Add &quot;Have You Seen Her?&quot; to your must read list now!	2004-03-19

I love Lori Foster and won't miss one of her titles hence the reason why I picked up this book.  I am always surprised by how much an author can grow or in some cases turn stale.  This is a perfect example of how Ms. Foster has only grown as an author.  If I had not read any of her previous works I would have been blown away by the hot story between Nick and Josie.  Blind date, plus switheroo hero made for a very fun romance.<br />Ms. Leto is a new author for me and I really found her short story (short being the key word here) a pleasant read.  These were two pleasurable reads from two very talented ladies.  If you are new to Ms. Foster and you liked this story you should really pick up some of her newer work, you'll be blown away!  I know I'm on my way to look from some other works by Ms. Leto. and eagerly wait for Ms. Foster to release a new title!	2004-03-15

There were slow period throughout the book that kept me from giving this book a higher score.  Ms. Kauffman has managed to include humor and provide a rather entertaining twist to the whole Cinderella storyline.<br />Picture it...two sisters vastly different.  Pepper loves to be pampered, shop, and travel.  Darby is happiest on her horse ranch, can't be bothered with flying, and her idea of shopping means one store and the end result being jeans. Darby's life is about to be turned upside down when her baby sister calls from South America and askes Darby to fill in and play hostess to their father's very important client.  Darby says no way.  This means she has to get dressed up, leave her precious horses, and horror of horrors get on a plan and fly to D.C..  Of course she does this, she loves her sister but the beauty spa (Glass Slipper Inc.) is not what she counted on.  Never mind the hunky Shane Morgan that calls the three leaders of the spa Godmothers.<br />Shane is back in D.C. because his grandmother has passed away and the huge Morgan assests are now his.  Now, instead of traveling the world he is sitting in meetings and working almost 20 hours a day.  The one thing that keeps him sane are the memories of the sweet Darby.  Now fate seems to be set on putting these two people together, over, and over, and well...you get the picture. Now somehow they are both going to have to finish what they started not only for their families but between the two of them.  Can they make this relationship work?<br />Again this was a fun story but at times lagged.  This is really more of a mainstream novel then a full out romance.  Darby and Shane have great chemistry and the three godmothers of Glass Slipper Inc. are great secondary characters.  You are in for a nice read if you pick up this book.	2004-03-14

Why was this family targeted and just who is the group that is claiming responsiblity for the bombing?  Before Lindsay knows it she is right in the thick of things and this case is about to get very personal.<br />This was a very fast paced read with many twist and turns and more like what Mr. Patterson is known for in his writing. Secondary storylines add to the overall main story and new characters are introduced, and of course characters from the previous titles in this series are included. If you have been reading this series from the beginning then you won't want to miss this latest installment.	2004-03-13

This is the first time that I've read Ms. Allende and maybe due to the fact that I've not read any of her previous titles I did not have any expectations when beginning this story and as a result found this a pleasent read.<br />Although there were some slow parts I enjoyed the history of these two families but in the same breath found it at times difficult to follow the many different characters that were introduced. Still it was nice to be given a chance to know the various characters that make up this story and as a result given a chance to know the families.<br />I look forward to reading Ms. Allende again in the future and recommend this book as a nice way to pass the weekend.	2004-03-13

Okay first off as many reviewers have already stated this is NOT &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;.  If your fine with this, or are able to get past this you will find that this is an enjoyable book that although may not be considered one of the &quot;classics&quot; later on in time is still worthy of reading.<br />Ms. Monk Kidd has picked a very touchy subject to write about and I feel manages to tackle many different aspects of the Civil-rights movement that many are not willing to touch.  So what that Lily is the only white heroine surrounded by African-American women?  These women do indeed have something to teach the young and yes abused Lily. If you are a reader that needs to have a message in a book to find it enjoyable then the message you will find here which I think many are overlooking is the message of acceptance.<br />Again I think many that have read this book have gone in with very high expectations (&quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;) and of course this novel will fall short if your going to compare it to the previously stated classic.  If you are one of the few that have the ability to open a book and read it for what it has to offer then you will find this book to be an enjoyable read.	2004-03-11

I've read plenty of Mr. Patterson's works (1st to Die, Kiss The Girls...) so I knew that he was capable of penning a story that would draw me in and not let go until the final page.  What I was not prepared for was this story that highlighted the fact that Mr. Patterson is a multifaceted author that was totally capable of penning a story from a women's POV and actually doing this with a certain degree of believability.  Yes, this is a story that will pull on your emotions.  I feel that it's a discredit to call this \\"clap trap drivel\\" and warn the reader that yes; you may just tear up during the course of your reading.  I feel that this is another point in Mr. Patterson's favor though.  In less then 300 pages he makes you feel connected to the characters and although you know it's not going to be a totally happy ending you will still feel compelled to continue reading.  I feel that it's a statement to an author's talent if you can feel connected to a character and all the good and bad things that this might entail.  To be able to touch a reader through the written word is not as easy as some would think.<br />This is a story that is written in the form of a diary from a woman named Suzanne to her son Nicholas.  Matt gives this diary to Katie a woman that he has fallen in love with but is unable to commit to.  He hopes that this diary will help explain the way he is and why he had to leave her.  In this diary Suzanne tells of how she met Nicholas' dad Matt and how their love grew over time and the various obstacles that stood in their way.  Eventually though Suzanne's health condition makes itself known and you realize that this happy ever after love is really living on borrowed time.  While reading this diary Katie soon begins to understand the man that she loves and through the diary finds a connection not only with Suzanne but with little Nicholas as well.  She continues reading because she has to find out what happened to this family and how Matt came to be in her life and if it's possible for Matt and Katie to ever find a happy ending as well.<br />Again this story was great in the fact that I was completely drawn into the storyline right from the beginning.  Yes, I realize that this novel may not be for everyone.  In fact stay clear if you are bothered by sentimentality, emotional ups and downs, love stories, and did not care for the movies Steel Magnolia's or Terms of Endearment.

A murder of course.  Kelly Santos grew up without a family or a past that she can remember.  She left New Orleans as soon as she graduated from high school and never planned on returning.

Lindsay and company are back and facing a much different kind of killer then they faced in book one.  This killer seems to be targeting families of S.F. police officers, the problem is they are all seeming racial in motivation.  It's a race against time as the highly talented sniper killer stalks those that are linked to police officers in the S.F bay area.<br />This book was not as entertaining as the first book &quot;1st To Die&quot; but it was nice to see the 'ol ladies gang back together again.  I was not driven to turn the pages in this read partially due to the fact that there was just not a whole lot of suspense built up in my opinion. This seemed to be a rushed write and agree with one of the previous reviewers that this was not one of his best efforts but then again I've been spoiled by reading many of his other works that have kept me glued to my chair.  Still this was a read that I would not avoid but would recommend that you borrow it from a friend or a local library.	2004-03-07

This was a very engaging story with very interesting characters as well as a very fast moving plot.  The story opens up with the death of a couple during a time when war was sweeping Europe, we then move to present time and Houston, Texas and are introduced to homicide detective Sean Jamison.  Sean is thinking about retirement.  He really wants to find the kind of love that his parents shared.  True, deep, and abiding love. Sean knows that his best chance at finding this woman is by hanging up his hat and then while looking for another suspect for another crime he happens upon an old tattered coat that he knows will lead him to his true love.  He finally finds this woman with help of the coat that she purchass at a flea market but she doesn't remember him or the past life that they shared.  The backdrop for this romance is a storyline that revoloves around a serial killer that has killed before and has tangled with Laura and Sean in their past lives.  This killer has again pinpointed Laura and now it's a race against time to stop him before Sean looses her again to this vicious killer.<br />This was a very and interesting read and as I stated earlier managed to devour in one day.  I've never read Mr. Sulik prior to this but I will now look for his other titles when they are available.  Do yourself a favor and get your hands on a copy of this book.	2004-03-03

First off you should know that this is a debut novel and who knows how much Ms. Kava has penned before getting published the point is she is just getting a feel for what sells and what her fan base will be.  With that said on to the review.<br />For the most part I found this story to be a fine read and not as bad as previously reviewed.  Yes, it's a no brainer on who the killer is almost right from the start but I think the challange of reading about the crime being solved was just as entertaining.  So what if you know who did it...read on and see how he gets caught.  As for the romance yes the dreaded idea of romance is introduced but falls way short on what I would call a secondary plot to the story.  Both Nick and Maggie have their own personal issues that have helped to define who they are and in my opinion Ms. Kava was true to the developing relationship between the two of them and how they interacted with other characters.  Be prepared to really not like Christine Nick's sister.  She was in my opinion one of the most annoying characters that I've ever read and as a result really did not give a fig about what happened to her.  Then again perhaps that's exactly what Ms. Kava wanted us to feel.  Nick is clearly out of his league in his current profession but then again it helps to prove that although he may be perfect and yummy to look at, he is at the same time human with all the flaws that come with that distiction.<br />This book did have some flaws but again no one is perfect, as for reading Ms. Kava again sure why not her debut is worthy of a first time read and is entertaining enough and even though it won't make it onto my keeper shelf she is not an author that I will go out of my to avoid.	2004-03-03

Ms. Novak took a very different approach to the serial killer storyline and created a very fast paced read that hooked me right from the start and did not let go until I finally read the last sentence.<br />Madison Lieberman is trying to put her life back together.  See she is the daughter of the supposed &quot;Sandpoint Strangler&quot; and as a result she has lost everything.  Her husband divorced her and she is now left to get her act together at the same time deal with what is left of her family and the suspicion that followes her after the suicide death of her father.<br />Caleb Tovato once worked the Sandpoint Strangler case when he was an active duty cop.  Now he has retired from the force and make his living as a true crime author.  His ex-wife pulls him once again into the intrigue and mystery of the unsolved strangler case when her sister turns up missing right where the strangler used to hunt his victims.  Despite his better judgement Caleb goes back to Washington State in order to help his ex find her sister.  He finds the perfect chance to prove not only the fact that the real Sandpoint Strangler is truly dead but that they had the right guy pegged for the crimes by moving into Madison's gatehouse as a renter while doing consulting work in Seattle.  At least that's his story to Maddy.  What he dosen't expect though is to fall in love and by a certain twist of fate put Maddy right in the line of fire of a killer.<br />This book had so many twists and turns and such engaging characters that I found myself unable to put the book down.  By making the heroine the daughter of a killer Ms. Novak puts us on the otherside of the fence and forces us to look at how the families of these nightmares have just as much to deal with as the victims families.  It's true what they say you can't pick your families only your friends.  Ms. Novak is truly on her way to being a romantic suspense author you won't want to miss.	2004-03-02

I have been a long time fan of this very talented author and was just recently on a trip back to the States which meant a very long airplane trip.  I was so thrilled when this title was release and I found it at my local bookseller that I grabbed it without a second thought and tucked it into my carry on.  My 11 hour trip was not as painful as I thought it would be once I stepped into the world that Ms. Foster has created.<br />We met Bryan briefly in her story &quot;Say No To Joe&quot; and I was thrilled to find out that this was his story.  Bryan is a twin that has decided that it's his job to protect his brother Bruce a preacher and who has just recently been attacked due to the work that he does regarding running a safe-house for ex-ladies of the night.  This was a no brainer as far as Bryan was concerned he would step into his brothers shoes, do what he could for the ladies under his brothers care and most importantly find out who wants his brother dead.  That is until he made the mistake of trying to &quot;rescue&quot; a damsel in distress by the name of Shay.  Now his little world has been turned upside down because he should be acting like a preacher but his thoughts are anything but heavenly.  In fact Shay has knocked him right off his feet.  This is a big problem for the bounty-hunter that would never trust another woman again.<br />Shay can't believe her good fortune when Preacher saves her from a bad situation.  Shay is a do-gooder but has been labled and branded a princess with too much money on her hands and not enough stength of conviction to really make a difference.  Well, she has been given the perfect chance to prove all those that don't believe in her that they are totally wrong.  Now she is working on the front line so to speak.  She tells Bryan that she's not a hooker but does not want the other women at the safe house to know this.  She then goes about the business of drawing everyone under her spell proving that she is serious about helping these women turn their lives around.  Her main problem is trying to prove to Bryan that their attraction is not wrong.  This is not easy since on top of all that was previously mentioned someone is trying to close down the safe house but who and why?<br />This was a fast quirky page turning read.  Joe, Luna, and Willow and Austin make a return performance as well as Jamie Creed all living in Visitation.  The relationship between Bryan and Shay is carefully constructed and as a result although peppered with Ms. Foster trademark sensuality this is not a read that dives right into an intimate relationship between the two main character but instead slowly lead to the admission that their relationship is more then lust. This is really a must read if you are a fan of Ms. Foster.  If this is a first time read for you fear not this is a stand alone book and you will not be left scratching your head as to the various relationships that are presented.  If anything this will drive you to pick up more of her titles.  Always a good thing if you ask me.hese women turn their lives around.

First off I read just about any genre so I was not put off by the fact that this was more of a mystery novel with a dash of romance added between Alex and Jill.<br />My problem with this read was due to the fact that I felt that some of the sub plots (i.e Lauren, Thomas, and the rest of the family dislike/like/back to dislike) as well as Jill's friend KC witnessing her friends apartment being broken into were never fully explained (meaning why were these problems introduced if they didn't play a part in the story except to add several pages to the read) and another question that plagued me was when exactly did Alex start feeling things for the almost always nauseous Jill? She was constantly wanting to or getting sick. The mystery about Kate was a good vehicle which moved the story forward and the several pages that went back and explained who Anne, Edward, and Kate were was in my opinion very interesting.  Jill on the other hand made me frustrated, angry, and forget about feeling any sympathy for her!  First she is constantly unsure about Alex but not enough to prevent her from sleeping with him.  The total lack of communication between these two people was another difficult thing to understand. The rest of the family was at turns nasty and then nice but it always seemed as if the explanation of how these people felt for Jill was always left hanging.  The mystery regarding Hal and his love affair with Kate was in my opinion only a sad way in which to introduce the whole premise of the story.<br />If you want a frustrated 400+ page read well this is the book for you.  The only thing that kept me turning the pages was 1) I wanted to see if things would work out between Alex and Jill with a certain amount of credibility and 2) to find out just exactly what happened to Kate all those years ago!  Do yourself a favor and pick this book up second hand or borrow one from a friend.	2004-02-15

Ms. Chevalier's &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; was a deftly woven tapestry of words that tied together several different individuals via one character named Nicolas des Innocents a very talented but vain artist.<br />This story is told from the view point of several of the characters (each chapter is a character in the story) on the design and creation of a very important tapestry which depicted the seduction of the Unicorn by a lady. From the birth of the design by Nicolas for a very important partron in Paris to the weaving of the design by a family of weavers in Brussels this story covers the life of Nicolas and how his randy self effects everyone that he comes into contact with.<br />This was a well told tale that kept me glued to the pages.  Ms. Chevalier is a very talented author who chooses her inspiration for her stories from vivid works of art. This story will grab you from the very beginning and you will be drawn to the very interesting and at times funny characters that inhabit this little make belive world.

The last few books that I've read by Ms. Henley just seemed lacking in either romance, interesting characters, or a combination there of.  Her latest though has it all a great storyline, a heroine that you want to see have a happy ending, the tall dark and handsome hero, and of course the tragic set of circumstances that keep our young lovers apart.<br />This is really like a Cinderella story.  Elizabeth and John enjoy a chance meeting by a stream in Ireland.  Elizabeth enjoys their brief time together not realizing that John is heir to a Dukedom, and John is totally capitivated by Elizabeth's innocence and charm not realizing that the blonde beauty is will be his heart's desire instead of a passing fancy.  Soon they must part but their lives will cross paths again and despite her wicked mother (mom's not the nicest women in the world) and her nasty sister Maria, Elizabeth manages to enter proper society and steals tender moments with John that she hopes will eventually lead to marriage.  Problem is the entire Gunning family is lying about their heritage and background.  Elizabeth is not comfortable with this but finds that she is unable to change her mothers mind on the course that she has set out for herself and that is to catch rich, titled husband for the &quot;Beautiful Gunning Daughters.&quot;<br />Of course there are road block and situations that will keep John and Elizabeth from each other but since you like the characters you will be compelled to keep turning the pages.  Ms. Henley really knows her history and so her story is very descriptive and vivid and really brings to life these people that truly lived at one time.  If you love romance, sensual love scenes, and history in your historical romance you will find this to be a very entertaining read.	2004-02-12

I love suspense books that keep you guessing with the many twists and turns until you reach the very end.  Mr. Patterson's novel \\"1st to Die\\" gives you just that kind of read.  This is a very fast paced  read as well so be prepared to have a hard time putting it down so you can attend to the mundane details of life like cooking and cleaning.<br />Lindsay Boxer is a hard working detective on the San Francisco police force.  She is about to embark on one of the most challenging criminal cases of her career.  If that's not enough she is blindsided by a health issue that will plan a large role in how she handles the upcoming investigation, and if all of this is not enough she is given a new partner Chris Raliegh and he makes her feel things she would rather not have to deal with at the current time.  Funny where support and strenghth come from.<br />Someone is murdering newly married couples in the San Francisco Bay area.  There have been two murders with very few clues left behind.  Lindsey is fighting the battle of trying to stay one step ahead of this cruel killer while still staying afloat in life.  Then she receives a call from across the U.S. it looks like her killer has killed again but not in California.  Is it a copycat or has the killer taken his act out on the road?  What is the connection if there is one?  And will she find the one clue that will lead to a killer before he kills again?<br />With the help of friends that she meets along the way as well as an already established friendship with the local M.E. these saavy women develop the woman's murder club.  With the police, M.E.'s office, press, and trial issues represented these four women work on the side to bring down a killer.<br />Again this is a very fasted pace read, with so many twists and turns you will question exactly who the bad guy is up until the very last page.  I highly recommend this read if you like suspense and edge of your seat reading.	2004-02-11

After spending the weekend with her he is not quite ready to let her go waltzing back into Lorries life (she explains her hopes and dreams during the weekend) and plans a way to show her exactly what she could be missing if she decided to go with her first love and not door number two...Nick.<br />This was a very lighthearted read with romance, love, mystery and that special something that makes a Jude Deveraux book a Jude Deveraux book.  If you are a long time fan of this very talented author you will not want to miss this read, if you are new to Ms. Deveraux you can't go wrong with cutting your romantic teeth on this one!	2004-02-10

His course had been set and he followed the murder of his family to the New World and the growing city of New York.  Mr. Hamill was very descriptive on his narrative regarding Ireland, the ocean crossing, and the politcal as well as religious issues that colored the day.  He lost me though soon after setting foot in New York.  The idea of slave, indentured servants, and Spaniards uniting to fight totally overshadowed the reason why Cormac left his native Ireland for New York.  Occassionally we would re-visit the oath he had sworn by coming to the new world but again our author would soon loose sight of this due to some other issue that seemed to catch his fancy.  In the end Cormac never managed to wipe the Warren clan off the face of the earth.<br />Again this book had so much potential but I feel that the author may have lost track of the direction he truly wished to go in.  So much was left out (much of New York history) with only brief glimps at what it was like to watch New York grow from a small city to the thriving metropolis that it is today.  Do yourself a favor borrow the book from a friend (as I did) or visit your local library.	2004-02-07

Now that he has found that woman in Kate what he thinks should be the easy part in convincing her that he's serious turns out to be harder then flying a new plane!  If he crashes and burns his heart will never be the same.<br />This was a very fast read and Ms. Lovelace does her part in fleshing out a story but not cheating the storyline by slighting Kate's feeling but at the same time not making her too stubborn.  This story is part of her \\"Protect and Defend\\" series.	2004-02-05

Kate knows it's not the handyman that works in her building even though he has been arrested for the murder.  Now she must work at odds against Jericho in order to prove her friend is innocent.<br />This was a very fast paced read full of twist and turns as well as plenty of chemistry between the two main characters.

For the most part I enjoyed this book but as some other reviewers have stated this book was not as good as it could have been.  This book basically picks up where &quot;Rosamund&quot; left off and we find ourselves at Scottish court and immediatly after just one meeting Rosamund is in love with Patrick Leslie.  Of course this love does seem to be of the &quot;lasting forever&quot; variety until of course a tragedy comes out of nowhere and ends that right away.  Fear not though there is a potiential lover waiting off in the wings for when Rosamund sees him as more then just a lover (he has loved her since he first saw her at a market when she was just a young girl) and of course our story ends there with Rosamund possibly falling in love with him.<br />This book was entertaing for me because Ms. Small is such a descriptive writer and I love the time that she takes with details that draw you into the time period.  Her lusty characters are also entertaining but I felt that there was just something lacking with this story that I was never fully able to pin-point and as a result was not fully able to enjoy this book as I have enjoyed past stories by Ms. Small.  In any event I would not avoid this story but I would suggest that you borrow it from a friend if you are new to Ms. Small or just not fully committed to wanting to purchase the book.	2004-02-05

As a history major in college I love to read the historical that you can tell the author took the time to research.  Ms. French does know her stuff when it comes to Alexander the Great!  This was a good story which is true to history (be prepared Alexander the Great died at the age of 32 and so too does our hero) and so I was reluctant to pick up a book that was based on an actual historic figuer such as Alexander.  After all I want a happy ending right?<br />The problem that I had with the book was due to the fact that there were so many slow parts, and parts where our heroine was just so silly or &quot;strong willed&quot; that I simply could not like her.  I did take into account the time period, the fact that she had been raised and allowed to think that even though she was a princess born she had the ability to be a prince, (not to say that women can't do it all) and then expect the conquering army to just leave her alone.  She finally warms up to Alexander after he marries her, sired a child on her, and tells her that he loves her problem is she comes around not long before he dies. Of course by this time she realizes what a goose she's been but it's too late.  Still over all Ms. French pens a very vividly descriptive tale that takes you back in time to a very unsettled period where armies did sweep steepes and seas in order to call a far off didstant land theirs.  This book may not be for everyone but it's still worth reading and if your unsure if you want to spend a lot of money, borrow it from a friend or by it second hand.	2004-01-29

This book will make an amazing addition to your book collection.<br />Ellie has just lost her sister and is in the process of mourning her when she finds out that she has left her horse farm to Ellie.  Ellie's husband George is less then thrilled with their new acquisition and does nothing but complain.

While out visiting the mares she experiences something unbelievable and soon finds herself eyeing two very amorous fairies that insist once they realize that Ellie has arrived that she must follow them to their King.<br />King Valdemar is mourning the passing of his sweet Rhiannon and does as she asked and that was to search out for her sister Ellie.  He must marry or the lives of all that he rules could come to an end.  Thinking that he could/would never love again Valdemar is surprised that the sweet but sassy Ellie stirs feelings in him that he thought were long dead with his beloved.

Before they can say their \\"I do's\\" Ellie must untangle herself from George and both Ellie and Valdemar must come to terms with their loss of Rhiannon.<br />Again this is a short story (less then 90 pages) so the story moves swiftly and is not an overly in-depth story.

I have been a long time fan of this talented author but her Effington Family stories are by far my favorite.  This is Philidelphia (Delia to family and friends) story and it was not only romantic but a fun read as well.<br />Delia has shocked society, family and friends when she secretly marries a very unproper man.  Well, her scanadalous marriage is brought to a very short end by the untimely death of said groom.  Wed less then a week and already a widow what's a girl to do?  Well, she takes a break in the country for six months and then moves back to London of course!<br />What Delia does not know is that her dead groom was actually an undercover agent for the crown and his death is suspect.  The powers that be take measures to protect the unawares Delia and puts agents undercover in her home in the form of servents.  Enter Tony St. Stephens.  This newly named Viscount realizes that this must be his final assignment.  He has a title to worry about now.  Problems is that he is disguised as an elderly butler and Delia has taken it upon herself to befriend this man. How can this be a problem?  Well, it's great for the investigation.  Not so great for the young Viscount that now finds himself attracted to Delia.  Delia on the other hand can't explain why she feels so safe with her butler but there you have it.  Delia though is now aware that once her period of mourning is over she will be free to live her life as she will.  This means searching for and finding great adventure around every corner. This of course sends chills down Tony's back because her few ideas that she has shared with her butler would cause a few eyebrows to be raised.  It's also not good news for the Viscount that has finally decided that she is the one for him.  Her first foray into living despite what society thinks is switching places with her twin Cassie at the annual family Ride and Ball.  Here she meets the handsome and charming Viscount St. Stephens for the first time. Needless to say he makes a rather &quot;grand&quot; impression on her.  Now she is in a pickle.  He thinks that she is Cassie, or does he???<br />Before you know it these two are spending time together all the time and Tony is finding it hard to keep his secret self seperate from his normal self (make sense?) and as the danger to Delia gets closer to home the stakes are raised and more secrets are found with surprising results.  Soon the mystery of the missing notebook is solved, love has indeed won the day (no not that easily but eventually) and we have had another nice visit with the zany Effington Clan.<br />This was a fun book to read.  Delia was not written as a flibberty-gibbit and she has quite a lot of spunk but not obnoxiously so.  Tony is a true romantic hero if a bit misguided at times but that just makes him a little more likeable if you ask me.

I found this book to be a fun read which highlighted the first of a new series by the very talented Sherrilyn Kenyon.  The other contributing authors Ms. Carlyle and newcomer Nicole Camden also pen hot steamy romances that were entertaining and fun to read.<br />Sherrilyn Kenyon's story \\"BAD to the Bone\\" takes us to an island get away where mid-west teacher Marianne Webernec finds herself the winner of a \\"Hideaway Heroine Sweepstakes\\".  She gets to live her favorite romance novel.  Problem is the guy that is cast as \\"the hero\\" is a wet rag and less then romance inspiring.  While on a stroll along the beach she finds herself literally swept away by a muscled yummy man Kyle Foster.  Kyle is on a forced vacation in order to heal from wound that he sustained in the field.  He is a Bureau of American Defense (BAD) agent and a real honest to goodness secret agent.  Kyle finds himself drawn to Marianne and finds out why she's there and then kidnaps her in order to fulfill more then just her fantasy.  What they find out is that truth can be sexier then fiction.<br />Liz Caryle's \\"Lets Talk About Sex\\" centers around Dr. Delia Sydney.  She is a divorcee living in an ugly house, driving a wreck, and wishing that her life was a little more exciting.  She can give great advice about relationships she just can't seem to find her own happily ever after.  Then just when she thinks life can't get any worse her car breaks down in front of Nick Woodruff's house.  She has already met the handsome and rugged cop and was not impressed with the first meeting.  The second one does not look like it's going to be any better but then things are not always what they seem.  Eventually these two find that they have a lot in common and that the attraction that they both feel can not be ignored.  This was a very witty and fun read not to mention the fact that there was great chemistry that really added to the story.<br />Nicole Camden's \\"The Nekkid Truth\\" was different but still a fun read.  Debbie Valley is a photographer that occasionally works for the local police department.  Debbie was in an accident several years earlier and as a result she does not recognize faces.  She even doesn't recogonize her own face.  This leads her to recognize a person by identifying peoples bodies.  Despite her problem she still finds herself drawn to Detective Marshall Scott.  Marshall is drawn to the flirty Debbie but is not sure if a relationship between the two of them is a good idea.  See he was in the car that hurt Debbie and now he is not sure if she blames him for her condition.  Still despite how hard they both work to avoid the mutual attraction they find themselves getting together and eventually they quit fighting their feelings.  On top of this there is an unsovled murder that Marshal is investigating and it looks like the only one that can help him solve the crime is Debbie with the use of her body recognition.  This story was told from the prespective of Debbie and as a result is written in the first person.  That took awile to get used to I must admit.  This story would have probably been better as a full lenghth story rather then a short story but it was still worth reading.  I would have liked to have seen the relationship between Debbie and Marshall as it was before the accident since I feel that it was important to how they later reacted to each other.  Still this was a good effort for a first time read.<br />All said this was a real good book and one that I would not miss.  I think that it's important for people to realize that when you read short stories like these that the stories will move at a rather fast clip and some details may be left out that would normally be included in a full lenghth title.

The plot drifted and eventually was non-existant, the character developement was totally lacking as if Ms. Lindsey could not decide on which twin was going to be the heroine until the end.  Do yourself a favor if you really want to read a book by Ms. Lindsey pick up one of her older books, or if you're dead set on reading this one, pick it up at the library or borrow it from a friend.	2003-12-09

Ms. Kenyon is the first author that completely hooked me on this sub-genre of paranormal romance!<br />This is Zarek's story and I think by far the best!  I was concerned that I would not care for his story since he was less then totally likeable in the past stories that he was in.  I feared in vain!  Ms. Kenyon managed to write this story and make me totally fall in love with Zarek!<br />Zarek is a former slave. During his mortal life he knew nothing but pain.  He was the whipping boy, and gentle goodness was totally absent from his life.  Life as a Dark-Hunter is no better.  He has been banished to the wilds of Alaska for the past 900 years for a crime he can't remember.  What he does not know is that Ash has made a deal with the devil (ok not the devil, Artemis the she-devil of the Gods) Zarek is going to be judged by the one women who has never judged a man and found him innocent!<br />Astrid has been selected to judge Zarek.  Ash knows that Astrid will see the good in Zarek and so he puts all his faith in Astrid!  Astrid is sent to Zarek and is blind so she is unable to see the person that she is to judge.  She feels that she does not have what it takes to give an fair verdict since the last man she judged she had the bad luck of falling for him.  Problem was he ended up trying to kill her.  Still she takes her assignment and finds herself with a grumpy, dark-hunter who does not care one way or another if he lives or dies!<br />Zarek can't believe that the time he is spending with Astrid is starting to thaw his long ago frozen heart.  She makes him want things that he feels that he should'nt have, and that's Astrid.  Her heart, and her soul.  He is not worthy in his opinion since he is a former slave and she is a star far out of his reach.  Astrid finds herself falling in love with Zarek, knowing that he is a good man.  She knows him better then anyone, and is willing to break her promise not to get personally involved with her charge by allowing him into her heart!<br />Together they fight off the bad guys and find each other!  This was a very touching story and a few times I found myself crying! This book introduces us to some new dark-hunters as well as squires, as well as explain some of the mystery surrounding Zarek. This book was a very fast read and I can't wait until the next book in this series is released!!  In the mean time I guess I will have to re-read the ones that I already have!

There are six short stories in this book so keep in mind that &quot;short&quot; is the key word in that sentence.  Still all six authors managed to flesh out fun stories under 100 pages each that were fun to read!<br />Lori Fosters story &quot;He Sees You When You're Sleeping&quot; is a fun story about two neighbors that feel something for each other but one is involved in a relationship.  Or is he?  What happens when a Christmas wish comes true and your neighbor and friend becomes a lot more?  This was one of my favorites in this book!<br />Janelle Denison's story &quot;All She Wants for Christmas&quot; was my favorite in this collection.  Matthew Carlton has it all, money, looks, and he's a sucessful pediatrician.  What he can't find is love.  What happens when the one person he desires finally whispers a naughty request in Santa's ear (Matthew)?  Perhaps Christmas wishes are fulfilled all over!<br />Susan Donovan's &quot;Turning Up the Heat&quot; is a fun story and I can't tell you much about it without giving away the ending.  Suffice to say that Christmas Eve is not going to be as lonely as Valerie think's it's going to be.<br />Donna Kauffman's &quot;Baby, It's Cold Outside&quot; reunites childhood sweethearts and gives these two people a chance to &quot;fix&quot; what went wrong the first time.  This time love might actually win!<br />Alison Kent's &quot;A Blue Christmas&quot; is another story that reunites a man with the one person he thought he had a chance with.  This is Blue's chance to show Jessie what she missed the first time around!<br />Nancy Warren's story &quot;The Nutcracker Sweet&quot; brings together two co-workers together that on the outside appear to hate each other.  When a &quot;naughty&quot; comment is overheard by Tara she reacts in a totally different way then you would think she would.  Instead of getting mad, she gets even...and by doing so gets a little more then she thought she ever would!<br />These were fun stories, and again were real short.  As a result character development might not be what you expect or seen from these authors past titles which have been longer.  Still...they managed to add a little &quot;spice&quot; to this Christmas season.ts a little more then she thought she ever would!<br />These were fun stories, and again were real short.

Her father is a gambler and his last wager ended with him planning on handing his youngest daughter over to the man Cassie thinks she has killed.  With only a few pounds to their name Cassie, her sister Eliza and her father head to Scotland to stay with her aunt by marriage for as long as it takes to gather enough fund to set sail for America and a new life.

He lost his wife and child in childbirth and he is rather bruised.  He plans on making the scoundral that caused his pain to suffer and he has just the plan to do this.

She is everything that he could care for, but her fathers standing as a wasteral makes it impossible for them to have a future.  They do participate in a wage which has Cassie giving Lucien a kiss that leds to almost more then either one of them counted on!<br />This was a nice read and a change of pace by Ms. Hampton.  I enjoyed the characters (both primary and secondary) and felt that the story move well.  For a pleasent way to spend the evening you can't go wrong with this book!	2003-12-03

If I can't read a Book set in Scotland my second choice of book to read is a pirate book!  Ms. Ashley's book was whimsical, fun, and a good read!<br />What happens when a lady of breeding finds her new next door neighbor is a pirate?  Does she turn a stiff upper lip to the goings on and continue with her predictable life, or does she jump in with both feet and by doing so turns her life upside down and sideways?  Yes, you guessed it Alexandrea is not a water and milk miss and is done living her boring life!  She is contemplating her suitor list (she is a widow and the first time down the aisle was less then spectaculare, she was married to rake and he was not discreet to say the least!) when she overhears a commontion next door.  Going against her better judgement she races over with her footman, and cook in tow and rescues the dashing and handsome new Viscount Stokes.  What's the first thing he does after being rescued by Ms. Alastair?  If you said thank you you would be wrong, he kisses her senseless, and then introduces her to his 12 year old daughter...then he askes his new neighbor to sleep without any cloths just for him.<br />Grayson Finley is without a doubt a pirate from the top of his blonde head to the tip of his black thigh high boots.  He must give up his pirating days now because he is a father, and he has made a deal with the devil (Bad guy American pirate huneter Ardmore) and a deal with the British Government to help the exiled King of France.  What he does not have time for is his lovely nextdoor neighbor and the feeling he gets just remembering her untried kiss!  Problem is Alexandra does not know how to stay out of trouble and somehow always manages to end up in the thick of things surrounding his problem!<br />This was a fun and easy read. This book was filled with engaging characters both primary and secondary, and plenty of twist and turns.  Humor, and chemistry spiced up the pages so you won't be bored! I think the Ms. Ashely is an author we should continue to watch.should continue to watch.	2003-12-01

The other three authors managed to pen okay short stories but I must say that Ms. Kenyon and her dreamhunter story was the best!<br />The other three short stories were just a little too short.  Ms. Ashley's story was the second best but there was a lot left unexplained and as a result left me confused and unsure as to who her hero was and if he was an immortal what was going to happen to Channa Leigh?  Ms. Shayne's story as another reviewer stated was rather rushed and there really was little chemistry between the two main characters.  The last story by Ms. Thompson was an okay read and perhaps if this was a full lenghth book it would have been a better read.  Still this was a good effort.<br />Overall this was a decent read by four very talented authors. If you want a little variety in your reading then this is the book for you.	2003-11-28

I must admit that this has not been one of my favorites by this author.  I think she has finally come into her own since penning this novel.  I think it's unfair though to compare her to other authors based on the fact that they share the same genre, and location.<br />My biggest problem with this book was Adrienne.  I realize that she was abused and hurt but hello...to base your judgement on a person based on what they look like is shallow and in my opinion a waste of time in a romance book.  There were many different times I just wanted to shake her and say alright already!!!  The fact that it took her more then half the book to see beyond Hawk's looks to see the good in the man was upsetting.<br />Hawk on the other hand may have had the looks but he was hurting on the inside and found himself tied up with a shrew...still he saw past the facade to the goodness that was buried deep in Adrienne.  Just like a hero should.<br />This book was very slow to start but did pick up and Ms. Monings trademark humor and style began to shine out in the end.  For the most part this book had all the good things it needed to be a winner, time travel, yummy men in kilts, fairies, and intrigue...it was just not put together all that well.  If you are knew to Ms. Moning this is a good example of her earlier work and worth taking time to read...just be aware that she does have better books out there!	2003-11-27

Ms. Pepio's debut novel is a perfect example of why you read a romance novel.  I loved this book and did not put it down until I finished it!  This had all of my favorite things.  Set in Scotland, Yummy men in kilts,Romance, and very likeable characters (both primary and secondary)<br />A Chance meeting....<br />Gavin MacGregor and Hannah Campbell have a chance meeting that will change their lives forever.

He will marry his sister but promises that he will return her after a year and a day is up, or until their common foe is taken down.  Gavin promises not to consummate the marriage and this is not a problem until he sees his new bride. He is surprised that she awakens feeling in him that he thought were long dead.  Problem is he does not remember her as the lass he kissed at the loch ten years earlier.<br />Hannah Campbell willingly joins with Gavin.  She remembers that he is boy that stole her heart so long ago.  She does not understand why Gavin runs hot and then cold but she does know that she loves him and has for the past ten years.  She knows that once he remembers her things will be better.  Still despite the fact that Gavin does not remember her they are both drawn to each other and the natural chemistry that they shared earlier is alive and well.  Soon Gavin decides that he cares not for his promise to Owen Campbell and he allows himself to love Hannah fully.<br />Together they fight a common enemy but neither realizes that this enemy may be closer then they thought.  Will they bring an end to the horror that started ten years earlier along side a Scottish loch before Gavin realizes he has always loved Hannah and that they already have a history and past before she is taken away from him again?<br />This author amazed me with her storytelling ability.  She has a very unique voice that is reminiscent of classic Julie Garwood and her Scottish tales. Ms. Pepio is a great new talent and we are all lucky that she has shared her talent with us.  This story made me laugh and cry which is always in my opinion as a sign of a good book. I was so sad when I finished the story and had to say farewell to Gavin and Hannah.  This book has made it onto my keeper shelf and Ms. Pepio will be an author I will purchase on name recognition alone!

Wilder's series &quot;The Shadow Dweller Series&quot;.  Even though I have not read the first two books I was still drawn into these two short stories and I will be looking for the previous books soon.<br />The first story is &quot;Sins of the Flesh&quot; which was a &quot;Romantic Times magazine Top Pick&quot; and my personal favorite between the two stories.  This is Alexandre's story.  Alexandre is a old vampire and Elder of the council.  He is trying so hard to keep those that dwell in the shadows safe but he is being plagued by the mysterious deaths of the local vampires.  These Vampires appear to be catching on fire and only at night.  It's a race against time to find out who is hurting the vampires.  On top of all that he is fighting his attraction to Sunni.  She is everything her name implys.  She is a young vampire and she is dogging Alexndre's heels.  He is worried that he will not be able to keep her safe and so he tries without success to keep his heart safe from her but their own mutal attraction can not be ignored.  Soon Alexandre finds out that Sunni has been injected with the killing potion that is killing the other vampires.  He now needs to make a deal with the devil (Cass his ex-lover and now foe) in order to save the love of his life Sunni.<br />Temptation is the second short story in this book.  This is Sinjin's story.  Sinjin owns the &quot;Chat Noir&quot; a bar and resteraunt that is popular with the preternatual crowd as well as humans.  He has noticed that a dark haired lady keeps coming in each night and he can't help but notice that she is waking his heart that he thought was long dead after the death of his best friend and lover Bliss several months earlier.<br />Vivian is trying to find herself after the death of her best friend Mel.  She finds herself in New Orleans and working for a handsome but younger man.  What she does not realize is that Sinjin is a vampire.  She is also finding herself in danger from someone that is out to kill her.<br />Together Sinjin and Vivian explore the attraction that neither one can ignore and at the same time Sinjin finds himself protecting the women that he loves from being killed.  Who is after her and why?  You'll need to read the story to find out.<br />Both stories were well written and the chemistry between the main characters in each book is hot!  This was a fast paced read and one I enjoyed very much.  This was a fun way to look at at the vampire world and I really enjoyed stepping into J.C.

I like most of my fellow reviewers must admit that although Ms. Laurens is a author that pick up simply because her name is on the cover I must also admit that if I had read the previous reviews I might not have jumped right out and gotten the book.<br />The story was just a little too long (I'd say at least 100 pages too long) and took too long for the story to develop. I was excited about the fact that Tony from &quot;Captain Jack's women&quot; was going to finally get his story within this series and since I so enjoyed the Cynster series I eagerly looked forward to this one.<br />The chemistry between Tristan and Leonora just was not there and I also wondered what the attraction was for either one of them. Both characters seemed one dimensional.  Tristan had so much potential and so I was sad that he just didn't come alive for me like her other characters. I admit that the reason I kept turning the pages was I was waiting for the story to pick up and the sparks to fly between the two main characters.  I also kept reading because Ms. Laurens took the time to write the story I figuered the least I could do was read it.<br />If you are new to Ms. Laurens don't let this review or others about this book scare you off.  She is a very talented author and well worth reading.  This is just not one of her better stories.	2003-11-22

She meets Resturant owner Jack Termaine at a chamber of commerce get together.  She is instantly attracted to the handsom Jack and thinks that the attraction is returned.  That is until a perfect size 3 walks up and claims Jack as her own.<br />Jack Termaine has been busy getting his business up and running he has not been giving much thought to his female companionship until he meets Kayla.  Kayla takes his breath away and he is instantly drawn to the beautiful Kayla but she does not see herself the same way he does and he is fighting her past and self perception.  He can wait though because she is exactly what he has been waiting for.<br />This was a great read.  The chemistry between the two main characters are great, her secondary charaters Jillian (Kayla's sister) and Rich (Jack's best friend) are great and I hope that they eventually get their own stories.  The story line is great and I liked the fact that Ms. Denison tackled the problems that less then perfect figured women face.  This book has made it to my keeper shelf!	2003-11-19

She grabs you with her quirky way of looking at life and love from the very first page and maintains the momentum until the end.  I have never laughed so much through out a book as much as I did at this one.  Since I have been a displaced Yank in England (I lived there for three years) I not only understood the British/Scottish slang but I understood how Kathie felt during her &quot;love at first sight with yummy scotsman&quot; situations!<br />I must admit to being frustrated with Kathie a few times but these time were easy to overlook when you consider the other aspects of the story.  If you love romance, and laughter you can't go wrong with this story.  Ms. MacAlister is a very talented author and I highly enjoyed steping into her world if for only a short time!	2003-11-16

I was anxious to get to Ms. Holt's latest story since I didn't care for her last one all that much.  Ms. Holt is back on her stride and this story was better then the last.<br />The character's are rather likeable this time around.  Emma is a vicar's daughter that has fallen on hard times since the death of her father.  She is now responsible for her little sister and sick mother but she make time to go to the local lord, Viscount Wakefield in order to protest against the unfair eviction notices of her neighbors.  She plans on making a deal with him.  For each time she will submit to his earthy desires, he will scratch off an eviction on his list.  What she doesn't expect to happen is to feel something beyond disgust for the amoral rake, or find out that he has rather endearing qualities.<br />John Clayton works hard to live up to the reputation of being a rake and general sleaze bag.  He is bored with life and all of the petty details that makes him loath his station in life.  Then in walks Emma and everything changes.  Emma does not give a farthing for his station in life, is not put off by his scowl, and has the audacity to lecture him on his rather fond affection for brandy.  She also wakes him up and forces to feel things that he never thought he was capable of feeling.<br />This was a very touching story.  I laughed out loud at some of Emma's actions and cheered her on in her attempt to win over John.  The chemisty between these two people from different social circles is hot but does not detract from the telling of the story.  This was a nice read and much more like what Ms. Holt has penned in the past.  If you enjoy a little more spice in your romance then you will enjoy this story.	2003-11-14

I must admit to buying anything with &quot;Kinley MacGregor&quot; or &quot;Sherrilyn Kenyon&quot; on the cover. She really is a talented author and really worth reading!<br />This is the third in the MacAllister series and although to many it's not on the same level as the previous two titles I think that it's just as good with a combination of quirky humor, and touching sentiment!<br />Ewan MacGregor is living a life of solitude because he feels that he was directly responsible for the death of his brother Kieran.  His quite but drunk life comes to a rather loud end when Nora comes to his cave dwelling looking for an escort to England.  She is shocked to see the naked but yummy Ewan laying out on his bed but Nora is not put off, she has plans and they include Ewan!<br />Ewan can not believe his ears!  Nora may be pretty but goodness she talks a lot!!! Still he finds himself drawn to her even though she is everything he has promised to stay away from!  Still he can't stop the feelings that are pounding away at him.  Eventually they both quit fighting the attraction and fall in love.  Of course this does not mean the end of the tale someone is out to keep them apart but why????<br />This was a great story!  Nora is a sweet breath of fresh air, and Ewan is the tortured but yummy hero!  This is a light read and fun.  This is a great series and you won't want to miss out on it!!!	2003-11-12
907773:US	49992211	RK9Z1MF2VBPWW	0804119724	447468621	Into the Night (Troubleshooters, Book 5)	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Well...Worth Reading But Not A  &quot;Must Read&quot;!	First off I should admit to not having read any other book in this series so yes, I was a tad bit confused with the prior relationships that were revisited especially the Sam and Mary Lou storyline that was one of three storylines that this book held.  Sam was a very unlikable man and since I was not &quot;up to date&quot; on the nuances of his relationship with Mary Lou this one was my least favorite storyline.<br />The Vince and Charlotte storyline was good.  It was at least easy to follow since she started their story with flashbacks from the past, and it was tied to Joan and her storyline with Mike.<br />Joan was an okay character.  Again I must agree with other reviewers about how annoying her age thing was.  She was not that old and hey, age is just a number!  I liked the action scene that Ms. Brockmann wrote for the opening, and I must admit to being new to Ms. Brockmann so I'm not totally sure what her writing style is like but she seems to be able to write a very interesting story that grabs you from the beginning.  This one just seemed to loose it's fizz at the end.  Maybe it's due to the whole &quot;no closure&quot; thing that seems to be a part of the formula for this series.  This is not a bad thing if you've read all of the books in the right order.  It is a little confusing if you are coming in mid way (which I admit is a problem with me that I have with most series.  I pick up #3 of 4 and then wonder why I'm so confused. &lt;G&gt;) but this is incentive to pick up past titles!<br />Still this is a good book worth picking up.  Especially if you have already put time into the series from the beginning.  If not and your like me and picked it up...just know that it's good but you should invest in the other titles if you want complete understanding (I know I will).	2003-11-09

It started off rather sad as has already been stated by another reviewer stated but it picks up after the first few chapters.<br />Grace Sutter is single and smart and her young sister has just passed away leaving behind an infant son.  Mary askes Grace to take the baby back to her home in Maine and to find the father Michael MacBain and to leave the baby with him.  Grace agrees and packs &quot;Baby&quot; and goes home but she finds herself the victim of a plane crash and the only survior besides herself and baby is a big strong Scot named Greylen.  Greylen is attracted to Grace and Grace finds herself kissing this handsome man without any thought.  But, before they can explore the feelings they have for each other they must get of the mountain and to safety.  Of course their problems don't stop then.  Grace confronts her nephew's father and decides to keep &quot;Baby&quot; a secret and to hold on to him herself.  This of course leads to all sorts of problems and now Grace has broken a deathbed promise to her sister.  Eventually everything turns out for the best but not before Grace's secrets and lies come all undone.<br />This was a nice read as I said before, the only problem I had with the story was the fact that I got tired of Grace's selfish behavior regarding the baby.  This problem is not resolved until the last few chapters in the book. Beside that I thought that this time travel was unique and I look forward to reading the next in the series.	2003-11-07

She is young and she feels as if she is missing out on life.

She is feeling emotions that she never had before.  Soon they start getting closer but Lisa still can't forget her obligations that rest in the future.

These three ladies are some of my all time favorite historical romance authors and it was fun to have them all together under one cover!  The stories are short and fast but sweet just the same, and it was fun to see old friends return if for only just a short time.<br />Lisa Kleypas' story is about Derek and Sara Craven's daughter Lydia.  Lydia is going to be marrying soon and it's not going to be a love match but that's okay with Lydia.  She is somewhat of a bluestocking and her mathmatical calculations show that the chances of her marrying for love are astronomically not in her favor.  Besides just because her parents married for love does not mean that she is going to have the same joy.  That is until she is locked in a wine celler with Dr. Jake Linley.  She once had a big crush on the handsome doctor but that has changed or has it?  There is no question that the good doctor brings out the worst in her, that is until they are together and have a chance to talk.  Maybe she won't have a loveless marriage after all.<br />Kinley MacGregor's story is a new series beginning which is the &quot;Brotherhood of the Sword&quot;.  Simon is a landless knight and has fallen in love with a scottish lass but there is a problem here.  Kenna is the cousin of the King of Scotland, and Simon is without title, land, or prosepects.  Oh...and there is the small problem that Kenna thinks that she is writing to a different man.  How can they both get what they want...a chance to love each other (that is after the mix-up is corrected)and live happily ever after?  You'll just have to read the story.<br />Julia Quinn's story is my favorite out of the three and it's Ned Blydon's (From Splendid)turn to fall in love.  Problem is he is engaged to one sister, and he is feeling things for the other.  Of course he is upset about nothing because it turns out his fiancee has other plans that do not include Ned. Maybe Ned can have that love match that his sister Belle keeps prattleing on about. Ms. Quinns trademark humor, romance, and characterization is plenty evident in this short story.<br />As I stated before these were three great stories.

Since I have not read \\"The Perfect Husband\\" I came to this book with an open mind and was not disappointed.  This was a fast paced read, with plenty of twists and turns that kept you guess until the final chapter.  This was not a rushed ending and I felt that the key pieces were tied together nicely at the end.<br />Melanie Stokes is an adopted child.  Her life for the last 20-years has been perfect.  But suddenly her perfect life is starting to unwind.  A reporter from Texas has come to Boston to confront Melanie on her parentage.  He believes that she is the daughter of a serial killer and that her adopted parents have adopted the child of the monster that took away their perfect Meagan.  At first Melanie does not believe it...after all how could her parents adopt her if they knew her past?  Then David Riggs walks into the picture.  She meets him as a waiter but finds out that he is really FBI investigating her father for insurance fraud.  Now things she never thought possible about her life now seem possible.  Melanie doesn't think that there is anyone that she can trust except for David.  Together they start to work on solving the mystery of Melanie's past and uncover a murder that took place twenty years earlier.<br />As I stated before I found this book to be very entertaining and a fast read.  The character's are well developed and the relationships between the many character's that make up this book are complex but explained if you read carefully.  If you enjoy a good suspense story then you will want to pick up this book.	2003-10-28

This was the firest time that I've ever read Ms. Chapman, and I can hardly wait for the first two books in the series to come in the mail!!!!<br />This book was very magical and it really was a new twist to time travel in the fact that so many travelled forward in time instead of back in time.<br />The romance between Michael MacBain and Dr. Elizabeth Hart was magical, steamy, and fun.  These were two characters that I really enjoyed reading about.  Michael is a Christmas Tree farmer in in Maine.  He is raising his son to not only respect the old traditions but the new traditions of his new home.  He has been hurt before in love and is not willing to put his heart on the line again, that is until Libby comes crashing into his life.<br />Dr. Elizabeth Hart (Libby) is a very talented trama surgeon but she experiences a very strange occurance in her operating room that sends her running to the opposite side of the country and smack into Michael MacBains prize Christmas trees.  What happens from that moment on is two people not sure about themselves or their place in life, actually find that they have more in common then the other thinks.  Libby can heal at will and Michael travelled 800 years into the future.  They are perfect for each other!!!<br />This was a very fast paced read.  Probably due to the fact that I didn't want to put the book down even for a second.  There is plenty of laughs and romance found on just about every page.  No not sex scenes, romance the \\"falling in love\\" kind of romance.  You won't be sorry that you picked this book up.  You will be sorry though if you miss out on it.	2003-10-26

Although I was loath to put this book down until the final page, it still was not as gripping as her last two books. Still if you like medical thrillers you can't go wrong with Ms. Gerritsen.<br />Without giving too much of the plot away the opening takes us to India and a massacred village.  Then we are back in Boston at a brutal murder of a young novice and the injury of an older nun.  The violence is unbelievable and there seems to be no indication of motive.  But when the investigation moves forward ties between the murder of the young novice and the murder of an unidentified women in an abandon building are linked by bizzare circumstances.  Detective Jane Rizzoli and Dr. Maura Isle work together to bring a killer to justice.<br />I enjoyed reading about Jane and I actually liked that Ms. Gerritsen was willing to portray this strong woman with normal human feelings of not thinking that she can do it all.  I don't feel that romance was a huge part of the book.  I'm a huge romance genre fan and the romance between Jane and Agent Gaberial Dean was way far back on the back burner and since I have been reading all the books involving Jane I was happy to see this relationship was continued and developed.  As for the romance issue with Dr. Isle I feel that it played a part in the storyline and again this was not a priority in the plot.  Yes, this book is not as griping as her last two...but then it is dealing with a different type of killer.<br />This book is worth picking up just keep and open mind and don't expect it to be like her others.  Suspense is at a premium and favorite characters from previous book are included.  If you have not read the last few books by Ms. Gerritsen don't worry, this book is still a stand alone story and by no means relys on previous titles.  This is a fast paced read and a good way to spend a weekend.	2003-10-25

Her latest book involves sex, murder, and suspense in a combination that leaves you guessing who the bad guy really is...and trust me you will be kept guessing.<br />Paris Gibson is a late night radio show host who is hiding in the dark from her past.  She is comfortable in the shadows, and enjoys being a faceless person to the masses.  Her world is turned upside down when \\"Valentino\\" a fan of her show calls and tells her that he is going to kill a girl in the next 72-hours.  Feeling that this call is not a hoax she makes a copy of the tape and heads to the police department.<br />Dr. Dean Malloy is the police psychologist that is consulted regarding the Valentino call.  He is shocked when he looks up and Paris is standing in his office.  To say Paris is stunned is an understatement.  These two have shared a past that they can't forget but are forced to face while they work together to find the girl Valentino has taken before she is found dead.  What they find is a sex club frequented by high school girls and that Dean's son may have been one of the last people to see Janey the girl that is now confirmed missing.  Somehow Valentino is involved and it's a race against time to find out who the quite spoken Valentino really is.<br />Plenty of secondary characters are introduced which causes many twist and turns in the plot. You won't be sure who the bad guy is until the very end.  Plenty of suspense, action, and the secondary plot revolving around Paris and Dean's relationship both past and present cause \\"Hello Darkness\\" to be a fast paced read that you won't want to miss.	2003-10-23

This was a fun paranormal romance with plenty of twists and turns, ghosts, and sizzeling chemistry between Matt and Darcy.<br />Secondary characters were important to this tale of a haunted historic landmark set in Virgina.  Darcy speaks to ghost's and with help from a childhood friend who died early in life, attempts to set things right in order to give these tortured souls a chance to rest.  What she is not expecting is falling for her rather reluctant host Matt who does not believe in ghosts or things that go bump in the night, nor does she expect to feel the fear that accompanies each encounter with the lady in white.<br />When things start happening and Darcy starts to experience rather dangerous accidents she wonders if the ghost is really human and why she poses such a threat.  Matt wonders if he will be able to get over the fact that he is falling for a ghost buster and he fears for her safety.<br />This was a fast paced read.  The only complaint that I have is that I didn't think Josh was used enough.  He was a character that I would have like to have seen more often.  Outside of that this was a good read that was entertaing and fun.  If you like romance, ghosts, and suspense...then you will like this story.	2003-10-22

Mack can't believe that Kindra would rather have an impersonal affair instead of a live and in person one.  So he challenges her to 12 hours of unbridled sex.

Problem is the new Drustan does not know who Gwen is and has serious doubts about her sanity.  One thing he can't get over is how much he wants to kiss her!<br />Of course there is more to the book then this.  I've just given you a small taste.  Trust me you won't be able to put this one down.  Laughs aplenty and steamy hot chemistry and romance.  Ms. Moning has become an author I'll pick up simply because her name is on the book!	2003-10-07

In felt that this story was building up to a great big finally and boom there it was...the end and...I don't know... I felt let down.  This was really a fast paced read up until the end and without giving up the ending I was left scratching my head as to how they figured it out and hello how they came about it.  Still this was an okay read... certainly not one to rush out and buy brand new but one that is worth picking up second hand or from the library.  Don't expect Lisa Gardner or Linda Howard but do keep an open mind.	2003-10-07

This book has been my favorite so far so I have to wonder if I read the same book previous reviewers read?  Although this book's main story line could possibly be pulled from today's headlines, I still felt that the location of the story, chemistry between the characters, and the fast paced read  all combine into a great book.<br />This is Kane's story and although he has rarely been mentioned in the previous Wright books his story has been well worth the wait.  Kane is the leader of an op that has A.J. staring as the sniper.  Her first attempt ends in failure so they have to move to plan B.  Problem is...Kane wants her lovely backside on a flight back to the States faster then he can figure what A.J. stands for!<br />A.J. has had a hard case of hero worship when it comes to Kane, and working with him is more then a dream come true.  Problem is she has her own emotional problems that prevent her from doing her job right the first time.  Together Kane and A.J. go into the desert in search of a terroist and find love in the process.<br />This was a great read, and like I stated earlier the chemistry between the two main characters is HOT.  Humor and suspense will also keep you turning the pages.	2003-10-04

This author without a doubt writes fast paced, funny, sexy stories.<br />In this off beat romance you have two people that have experienced pain by their significant other and as a result, Emma and Thomas are not prepared for the electrical connection that they both feel at their first meeting.  Try as the might they just can't fight off their attraction and when they finally get together it is beyond explosive!!!<br />The characterization is great.  Thomas is big, bad, and blonde and has become the owner of what he considers the to be a mutant of a dog (he's a Chinese Crested) and on top of that his new pet has a bladder problem and has to wear a sports sock with a maxi pad! As if this is not enough Thomas trusts no one.  He works as an undercover hitman and he has seen the worst that humanity has to offer.  No one is good at heart, at least that's what he thinks until he meets Emma.  Emma's Hairy's behavioral vet and seems to be the only bright side of the whole mess!<br /> Emma on the other hand knows trouble when it walks in the door and trouble with a capital T has just walked into her office. There is no way that this guy could be not only eye candy, but a good person to boot.  He looks to hard and unmoving and he has a thing for Rugby that she just dosen't understand.  That is until she sees him in action.  But can she trust him with her heart...<br />This was a great book with wonderful characters...you'll love Hairy and you will find yourself not being able to put this book down.  Ms. Donovan is a great talent and I now buy books simply because her name is on the cover!  You really need to add this book to your must read list if you like romance, laughs and fast paced story telling!	2003-09-30

There are so many twists and turns that you are kept guess as to who the &quot;Sinatra Killer&quot; is.  Women are being killed and at the scene of the crime is a CD player playing Sinatra songs.  No clues are being left behind and the police are puzzeled as to who the killer is and why he's killing.<br />Sara has been receiving crank calls and her friend and co-worker suggest that she speak with her husband who just so happens to be a police detective.

But at the same time that Eric and Sara start falling for each other, Eric finds out that there is a connection between the &quot;Sinatra Killer&quot; and Sara.  Could she be his next victim?<br />As stated previously this was a fast paced read and the romance between Eric and Sara is great!  You can really feel the chemistry beetween these two people.  You can also feel the fear that is presented due to the killer.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this book.  Ms. Davis is an author that you must add to you MUST READ list!	2003-09-22

Although there is romance present it is waaaay back on the back burner.  This is more of a mainstream suspense book packed with a lot of twists and turns that leave you wondering who the bad guy really is.  Although the answer to that question is answered before the end of the book it is still interesting to see how Windy and her team work to get the same answer.<br />If your squimish you may want to avoid this story.  The author goes into great detail regarding the murder scenes but I feel this only addes to drawing the reader into the story.  There are lags in the story but they are few and far between. Still this was a strong novel and should not be missed.	2003-09-21

Although this has not been one of my favorite books by JQ her trademark wit and humor along with likeable characters are still present in this story.  This is Eloise's story and this story picks up where Romancing Mr. Bridgerton left off.  We now know where Eloise headed at the end of the story.  She is off to begin her adventure.  Eloise has no idea what she's in for!<br />Sir Philip Crane is a botonist and father of twins and has no idea how to go about raising them.  Plants he knows, kids are a totally different story.  Philip decides that Ms. Bridgerton is the perfect solution.  They have been writing back and forth for over a year.  Now that his period of mourning is over he invites Eloise out to his estate to see if they will suit for marriage.  End result, Eloise shows up without warning and he is not expecting the 28 year old spinster to be so pretty, or so together.  And he certainly does not expect to be attracted to her!<br />This was still a funny story and quite frankly I can't put my finger on what exactly I found lacking but it just did not hit me as a great JQ book.  Still if you have fallen in love with the Bridgerton's (and who hasn't?) you won't want to miss this addition.	2003-08-28

This was the first time I've ever read Karen Marie Moning, and needless to say half way through this book I ran back out to Amazon and put her other four books in my shopping cart!  I'm not big on time travel and really only read a few authors that pen this sub-genre.  I have added Karen Marie Moning to this short list!!!<br />This was a very fun book due to the great characterization that she did.  Chloe is a perfect complement to Dageus.  She's funny, sweet, and totally from the 21st century.  Dageus is tall, dark, sexy...all right he's yummy period, oh and did I mention a 16th century druid?  Dageus is looking for a way to reverse a curse and Chloe is basically in the right place but at the wrong time and Dageus can't help himself.  Chloe is his mate, his love, and he's not going to let her go!  At least not if he can help it.  Chloe on the other hand is innocent, has no idea what this highlander is thinking, and loves historic artifacts (Museum business is what brings her to Dageus in the first place) imagine her surprise when her curiosity lands her tied to Dageus' bed!<br />This was a great book with laughs, romance, and yes...even tears!  I loved it and I can hardly wait for Ms. Monings other books to be delievered to my mailbox!	2003-08-22

I am a huge fan of Cheryl Holt and Kimberly Raye so Nina Bangs and Patricia Ryan were wonderful surprises for me.<br />I felt that the love scenes in all four books were scorchers but not used as filler but were important parts of the stories, and yes they were erotic but not as erotic as other titles in other romance lines.  Still these four short novelles were fast reads and well worth picking up.	2003-08-06

And the best part is the fun has only just begun!  These two are a riot and have great chemistry.  I was so sorry when I came to the final pages but I console myself knowing Ms. Hill is hard at work on the next story in this series!<br />Sylvie, Luc, Tante Lulu and other family members come out for a visit and you will fall in love with them all.

Ms. Cole's debut novel is great and I found it to be a fast and pleasurable read.  The chemistry between Nicole and Derek is great and the reaction that they each have to each other was the reason I kept picking this book up rather then doing the things that I should have been doing such as housework or yardwork!<br />Derek is a troubled soul who is willing to turn his back on his heritage and past.  He spends his days trying to forget his responsiblities and drinking.  He is also drawn to the sea and the race that will save his shipping interest.  Add to that he finds himself drawn to Nicole Lassiter.  She is everything that he should stay clear of but is unable to do that.<br />Nicole also has a love for the sea and when her father is put in jail under false pretences she decides that she will sail in the Circle Race.  The Lassiter's need the win as much as Sutherland (Derek) does but fate has other plans and it throws Nicole and Derek back together yet again.  Nicole is equally attracted to the dark and brooding Captain and she finds herself wondering what it would be like to call him her own.<br />This was a strong first time novel and I look forward to her upcoming story which is Grant's (Derek's brother)next.  For a great weekend read pick this book up.	2003-07-31

They have always been page turners for me with just the right amount of sensuality and storyline.  I was thrilled to find out that she was going to pen a modern day romance so I quickly preordered it from Amazon and patiently waited for it to be delivered to my box.  I was so sorry to find out that this book had no redeeming qualities!  NONE!<br />First off as other reviewers have stated the main characters Chloe and Rocco were pathetic.  Where was the attraction, the honesty, the relationship?  And if Chloe was sooooo attracted to Rocco why does she run off and start a fling with Colin the bartender?  And don't get me started on Rocco or Amy the witch!<br />Personally I was totally confused as to how Rocco and Chloe ended up together and a lot was left unsaid or unasked as far as getting to know each other.  Why did Chloe have pink hair?  What besides having and enjoying sex did these two people have in common?  NOTHING!  I'm sorry I like my characters to be real, but at the same time when I read romance I want it to be reasonable as to why the characters are together.  Sex does not keep a relationship together and outside of bed neither of these two people seemed to even like each other.<br />Do yourself a favor and borrow this book from a friend or the library or buy it second hand.	2003-07-27

I really love Emma Holly and as other reviewers have already stated found this book tedious at best.  I was first surprised by the shift in genre but felt that the premise was interesting and I was willing to give it a shot.  I was very sad to realize that I had to force myself to pick the book up in order to read it after the first few chapters.  Yes, I know books can at times have a slow start, but this one NEVER picked up. I kept looking back on the cover to make sure that it said Emma Holly instead of perhaps another name.  Alas Ms. Holly's name did grace the cover.  I kept reading for two reasons.  I spent money on the book, and I WANTED the story to get better only I couldn't change what was already printed.<br />If this is a first time read for you by this author pick up one of her older books in order to see what this author truly capable of.  Do yourself a favor and borrow the book from a friend.	2003-07-18

The concept was fun and a good introduction to her series for a &quot;newbie&quot; like me.<br />The other stories in the book were entertaining but if I had had the choice of picking them up and reading them as singular titles I probably would have not bothered.

The story of Steve and Liz is hot, wild, and wilde!  The chemistry is great and instantly combustable from the get go.<br />Liz is a coffee shop owner, and Steve is a P.I..  Their two worlds come together when Liz's nasty little cousin disappears and Liz feels that it's up to her to find her.  Enter Steve Wilde.  No one is more surprised then him when he looks up and there is Liz.  To say that she has stared in a number of his fantasies is putting it mildly.  Liz asks him to help her track down her cousin adding that she plans on going undercover at the phone sex business that her cousin workes for and Liz feels that this somehow played a roll in her cousin's disappearance act.<br />The end result is two people both stung by love the first time around in their lives start to feel more then just attraction while working together.  Liz and Steve realize that perhaps there is more out there and that they don't have to live their lives alone.  Steve's brother Eric and Jill come back and continue their relationship plus there is the teaser of perhaps Adrian getting a girl of his own.<br />Ms. Denison should be an author that you add to your MUST READ LIST!	2003-07-14

The book opens with him being a a VA hospital getting ready to be released with the unfortunate reality that his knee was never going to improve past what it already had, and that he would be physically challenged for the rest of his life. On top of this his sister leaves her daughter Natasha with Frisco when she goes off to rehab, so not only does Frisco have to deal with his personal tragedy, now he has to take care of a five year old and he's clueless as to what this little person needs and is positive that he isn't it.  He's not a whole man now. Or so he thinks.<br />Mia is a high school teacher and is Frisco's next door neighbor.  She finds herself drawn to this physically, and emotionally injured man.  She sees the good in him even if he doesn't and finds herself falling in love with him over the course of events.<br />The end result is a story full of emotion both happy and sad.  Natasha, and Mia open doors for Frisco and slowly he realizes that his life isn't over it's just changed a little.  Blue and Joe as well as the rest of Frisco's team show their faces and play a roll in the story, so you get to see old friends (well, new for me) as well as making new ones.  If you like military romances this is a great addition to your summer reading!	2003-07-08

Ms. Mccall delivers again with a strong hero and a great heroine.<br />Jonah Slade is an undercover CIA agent and he finds out that he has a son that is fifteen years old and that Evan has been kidnapped by a drug lord that has promised revenge for the death of his son.  Jonah is floored when he finds out that he was lied to fifteen years earlier, and that he has been cheated yet again by the Blaine family.  He will do all he can to save the son he didn't know he had even if it means that he gives himself up to Calderon the Columbian drug lord.<br />Macie Blaine has loved Jonah for years.  Even when he was dating her older sister.  She is torn in two when she finds out her sister has been killed, her father has been shot, and her nephew was abducted.  She knows the only thing left to do is to track down Jonah and tell him the truth and to ask for help.<br />Jonah agrees to go back to California with Macie and finds himself not only worried about the safety of his son, but also finds himself attracted to Macie.  She is everything her sister wasn't and more.  She was kind, loving, and forgiving, and strong when she needed to be.  Soon Jonah is totally in love with her and will do all he can to get his son back so he can start a family with Macie.<br />This was a fast paced read and although Macie is not one of her stronger characters she is still likable.  The secondary character plus the added intrigue of who the mole in the organization is helps move the story along.  This is really a great book to add to your summer reading list!	2003-07-04

This story is third in a trilogy that has been very entertaining.  In this story Briar seduces the wrong man and instead finds the one man that will love and protect her, and finally prove to her that not all men are weak.<br />Briar is the daughter of a pronounced traitor and she and her two sisters have been turned away from their family estate and made into outcasts.  Briar gently nurtures the flame of her hatred of Lord Radulf (Lily and the Sword) whom she feels is responsible for her fathers death and their current situation and sets out to take from him the one thing that she knows he cherishes the most the love of Lily.  Only her plans go awry she seduces Ivo instead thinking that he is her enemy.  She is shocked by the things he makes her feel and she is unsure how to act once she realizes her mistake.<br />Ivo de Vessey is a mercenary who fights for Radulf.  He has come north to York with his lord to settle trouble that is brewing on Lady Lily's land.  He recognizes Briar from the first as the young girl that used to follow him around when he fostered at her estate as a young boy.  Briar makes him feel things that he is best off forgetting but try as he might he can't walk away from the prickly lady and the mysteries that cloud her past.  Together they set out to unravel Briar's past and perhaps heal Ivo's past as well.<br />This was a good book and I would have given it 4 *'s except at times Briar was just like her name, to prickly and unlikeable at times and sometime out right cruel.  I often found myself wondering why Ivo put up with it.  I like a strong lady but at times she went overboard in her actions.  In my opinion the story was saved by Ivo a true Knight in every way and the mystery that surrounded the the young Briar and her sisters.  If you have read the previous two titles in this series you won't want to miss this one.  If you are new to the series this book still stands on it's own.  Either way Ms. Bennett has written another fine romance.	2003-07-01

Katie Priss is a perfect example of overcoming your past, and still finding love when it's right in front of your face.  Michael is a total hero in more ways then one.  I loved the interaction between Michael and Katie from the first.  There relationship evolves and is wonderful to read.<br />Wilhemina is a great character.  She really comes into her own and lets face it most of us are like this likeable lady then we want to admit.  Her storyline was just as entertaining as Michael and Katie's.  Chantal,and Jeremy, are also great additions to this wonderful cast of characters.<br />This should really be on your summer reading list.

Someone is stalking women and leaving erotic notes behind.  All of a sudden the stalker starts to kill his victims.  Why?  Although that question is answered I still came away with big questions.<br />Still this was a fast paced (perhaps a little to fast paced) book with plenty of chemistry between the main characters.

Book three in the series is very entertaining and a bit different from the previous titles within this series.  Set in Venice during Carnivale, Ms. Drake takes time to be very discriptive about the sights, sounds, and atmosphere that makes up this ancient city.  It is a perfect back drop for the telling of scary stories, or in this case a vampire story.<br />This book brings back favorites Maggie, Sean, Lucian, and Jade, while focusing on Ragnor whom you met at the end of &quot;When Darkness Falls.&quot;<br />This book is more of the supernatural then a romance although sparks fly and the chemistry is intense between Jordan a book critic and Ragnor the inforcer. Although the focus of the book is not on the growing relationship between Ragnor and Jordan i still very much worth reading. It reminded me a lot of Anne Rice vampire books.  The sensuality of the characters and the complex nature that makes up a vampire seemed to be the theme of this story. This book has incredible twists and turns and was a pleasure to read	2003-05-31

Their love is strong, but it is tested.  The trials and the tests that these both are put through only reaffirm their love for each other but at what cost?<br />This is a sweet novel and one that will grab your attention from the beginning.

This is Lucian's story and well worth picking up in my opinion.  I am new to the Vampire Genre so I picked up these books due to the author, and not due to the topic. I read the first book \\"Beneath A Blood Red Moon, and that of course led me to this one, and I was thrilled with it.<br />Lucian is the King of Vampires and the story opens with Lucian saving a young mortal woman (Jade) from certain death during a Halloween tour in Scotland.  Jade finally returns to New Orleans after her horrific ordeal knowing what she saw, but having no one believe that corpses came alive and killed the people in her tour.  She finally begins putting her life back together a year later, and then something odd starts to happen, she starts dreaming dreams about the man that saved her.  These are not the dreams that she should be having when she is involved with another man.... Even if that involvement has not led to bed yet.  Then something terrifying happens.  Survivors of the Scottish Halloween Massacre start being killed.  The ritual is the same, only it's now taking place in the states.  Jade is in danger, and only one man can save her Lucian.<br />Lucian saves the young Jade and is stunned to see his past finally coming back to haunt him.  The killers of the Scottish Massacre are his creator and her lieutenant Darin.  They are back and they are looking for revenge against Lucian.  Lucian knows that there are rules for his kind and that he is bound by them, but Sophia, and Darin must be stopped.  They choose Jade as their victim and use her as a weapon against Lucian.  See Lucian, Sophia, and even Darin believe that Jade is Lucian's long lost love and wife from his past, and Sophia will do all she can to destroy her.  Sophia hates Lucian, but wants him all the same and will all that she can to make sure that happens.<br />This is a great book and Maggie, Sean, and Jack make a return appearance in this page turning installment of Ms. Drakes Vampire trilogy.  Lucian is all a vampire should be, tall, dark, sexy, and just a little dangerous. I loved the added history and background of Lucian.  It helped a great deall to understand why he was the way he was.

I must admit that I am new to the sub genre of the vampire romance novel.  I love the concept but I have just not found many authors that have thrilled me. Ms. Drake has sold me totally on the idea of a sexy, sensual vampire.  I automatically pick up Ms. Drake's historic romance books, now I will pick up her Vampire novels as well!<br />Maggie Montgomery is owns a clothing boutique in the heart of the French Quarter.  This is a special store since it has been in her family for generations.  There has been a horrid murder in the French Quarter and there are blood drops found outside her backdoor literally.  This leads NOPD detective Sean Canady to her doorstep investigating to investigate this beauty in connection to the blood drops found outside.  Maggie is stunned and agrees to help in any way possible.  Sean is totally drawn to Maggie in a way that he can't understand and begins to pursue the reluctant lady despite the misgivings he has that she is holding something back.<br />Maggie has secrets that she is not willing to share, she is a vampire.  Needless to say Maggie is away of a past that she and Sean (Sean is an old soul as well) share, as well as the return of an enemy that means to destroy all that she has managed to create.  She finds herself drawn to Sean and eventually falls in love with him.  She still feels bad about keeping a part of her past from the sexy Sean, and her past may have a connection to the murders that are now plaguing the French Quarter.  She may know who is performing the frightening \\"Jack The Ripper\\" type murders but is unable to prevent them.  See the murder may be another vampire.  Eventually Maggie must confront not only her past, but love and trust Sean enough to tell him the truth about her in order to help him catch a killer.<br />This was an incredibly fast paced book, set in one of my favorite places.  Ms. Drake created a wonderful set of characters (both main and secondary characters) that really tell their own story.

While on the road her family is set upon by what is thought to be just road thiefs.  What is really happening is the beginning of a twisted plan by an evil man to destroy someone innocent.  Maddie's father is shot and is in need of a healer.  Maddie is told about a special healer, but she will have to make a long journey to get to this man.  Maddie agrees without question but soon thinks that her trip is in vain.  Maddie is led into a forest and left to find her own way to the healer.

When she next wakes up she is in the care of the most beautiful man she has ever seen.<br />Dance once had the great power of healing, but his power has been taken from him in a tragic way.

On the morning that is set for her to return to her brothers and father, the evil one appears and promises to take her away from Dance.  Dance will not see her harmed so he locks her away from danger, and in the process locks her into his heart.<br />This was a wonderful read full of the sensuality that Ms Lindsey is known for, and what readers expect.

This book still had all of the trademark quirky humor, characters, and dialogue that make up a true Jennifer Crusie book.  With that said I must admit that I just did not feel as connected to this story as I have to past books by this author.<br />I don't think there too many characters.  In a real life situation many people surround themeselves with family and friends.  This story demonstates that concept.  Eve, Nadine, Tilda, Davy, Simon, Clea, and let's not forget Steve the dog, as well as other characters not mentioned helped in my opinion to move the story along. I at least did not have the trouble that other had of keeping them all straight in my mind.  If you have a problem with a multiple character story, this book is not for you.  This is a light hearted romance with the gallery intrigue regarding art was very interesting.  Tilda and Davy's romance was a bit choppy, but it was still fun to read.	2003-05-15

Ms. Kingsley is not afraid to touch on dark subjects, and normally her hero's are dark and tortured.  Adam is no exception.<br />Callie has been bethrothed to an englishman that she has never met.  She has lived abroad in Greece, and Italy, but when her father dies, she promises to go to England and meet her gentleman.  On her way to her fate, she falls overboard and into the sea, she is rescued by Adam, who is out to sea getting ready to kill himself because he can find no joy in life since the tragic death of his wife and son two years earlier.  Adam ends up saving her in more ways then one and Callie returns the favor, and gives Adam another reason to live.<br />Again this is a moving story that touches are a dark subject (suicide) with characters that are more human then normal romance characters.  This story does not have the characters jumping into bed at every turn, and in actuality the love scene comes more towards the end of the story.  In my opinion this is a good thing, and allowed the characters to get to know each other, and respond to the attraction that both feel.  This is not a light, funny read, but still worth the time it will take to read it.	2003-05-14

In fact I can hardly wait until her next book comes out!<br />Janna MacNeil is the new PR person onboard to tame the \\"bad boy\\" reputation of the New York Blades.  This is going to be the hardest job she has ever taken.  Janna may seem tough on the outside, but inside she is wreck, with low self-esteem, and the fear that she will never be good enough.  Then she comes up against the Legendary bad boy himself Ty Gallagher. Her life will never be the same again!<br />Ty is the Captain of the Blades, and has NO plans on playing it the way the suits want him too, this means problems for Janna.  He won't be told what to do off the ice, including charity events, and interviews.  He will choose how he spends his time, and what events he will support.  He thinks that will be the end of that, but he did not count on Janna.  Janna tells him that she will be the \\"lyric in a song that he won't be able to get out of his head\\", and \\"the pebble in his shoe\\".  She won't let up on him and promises to make it her job in life to make sure he plays it straight.  What Ty also doesn't count on his being attratcted to the terrier that won't let up.  Janna impresses him by going head to head with him, and eventually he starts to see her in a different light.  Problem is Ty is he does not juggle the \\"relationship\\" and the drive for the Stanley Cup well.  He is an all or nothing kind of guy, so what happens when he must choose between love for the game, and perhaps love for the woman?  Read the book and find out!<br />This was a great book, full of laughs, and tears.  The characters were engaging and fun.

Problem is, Vermillion is not sure that that is the kind of lifestyle that she wants to lead.  She loves the outdoors, raising, and racing her horses.  She doesn't think that when the time comes on her 19th birthday that she can choose a protector. Especially since none of her suitors interest her in the least. There is also the added problem in the fact that she is finding herself drawn to the new groom in her stables, Calab.  He is everything a servent should not be.  He is arrogant, assertive, and just too good looking for Lee's peace of mind.  Still he awakens not only her heart, but her young body to passion.<br />Calab Tanner is not what he seems. Calab Tanner is an Officer for the British Army, and he is undercover to unveil a spy. Calab is sent to Parklands, Vermillion's home with her aunt becasue it looks as if the spy operates from that small estate.  Calab is set in his mission, but what he does not count on is being attracted to a possible spy, and not being able to walk away from that attraction.  Eventually he won't be able to fight his feelings for Lee, and realizes that there are actually two women in one.  Vermillion the potential member of the demimond, and Lee the young, kind girl that calls sevants friends.<br />Together Lee and Calab hunt for the spy, and fight their mutal attraction to each other.

I have read all four books of the Lambert Series, and I never would have guessed the ending!  Trust me you just have to pick up the book and read it.<br />This is the fourth and final book in the Lambert series and I am so sad to see this series come to an end.  Nouri and company have been highly entertaining, and if this series had been on T.V. it would have swept the ratings for sure.<br />In the final book aptly named Le Fin (The Ending) all of the loose ends between Nouri, Gabe, Charles, Tonya, Clint, and Renea are tied up.  I won't go into any details, since that would spoil it for you especially if you have been dedicated to reading the entire series, suffice to say as stated earlier Nouri and company are taken on a rollercoster ride for the final book that will leave you speechless.  I laughed and cried a few times with the characters! Always a good sign of an excellent book if you can feel the characters emotions.  It's a good thing this book came in the mail before my finals week or I probably would not have do so well otherwise.  I did not put this book down until the last page!

I had the opportunity to meet Leslie and her husband Leland in Germany this year.  This was the first book that I have read by Ms. Burbank, and I was completely swept away with the stories.  Secret of the Sea is a novella duet that will totally enchant you, and make you believe in fairytales, and in the mystical and magical world of the mermaid.<br />Book One is Lady Syren, set in Scotland in the Hebrides 1513.  In Lady Syren we meet Syren who is a mermaid.  She makes a wish that she may one day find a human man, one that will love her.  She gets her wish when Kieran \\"The Black McLeod\\" is stabbed and dumped overboard by his enemy Captain Stewart.  Syren rescues Kieran and takes him back to her home along the coast of Scotland and nurses him back to health.  Kieran is a pirate and has been given the option by King James IV of Scotland of a pardon if Kieran marries.  Kieran feels that his best chance of marriage would be to the lovely Syren.  Only problem is he does not realize that she is a mermaid.  Syren is allowed to walk on land during the day by transforms at nightfall back into a mermaid.  Syren agrees to Kieran's marriage proposal only if he will take her to Siren Isle where it is fabled that a necklace that will give immortality to a human will also give a mermaid the gift of mortality.  Syren wants to be human in the worst way.  A deal is made but neither Kieran nor Syren is sure that they can trust one another.  They are both drawn to each other but there is much that they both keep secret from each other. Kieran has also had everyone that he has ever loved taken from him so he is not ready to give his heart yet again.  Eventually Kieran finds out that Syren is a mermaid, and by this time he has fallen in love with the beautiful siren.  He will only accept marriage to her if she loves in him return. Of course she does but these to lovers must first triumph over the evil Captain Stewart and then there is the dangerous trip to Siren Isle that must be overcome before there can be a happy ending for these two people.  This was a great story set during one of my favorite time periods, you won't be able to put the book down before you read the ending of this one.<br />In book two Lord Nerus Theodora Redman aka Red is a reporter for The Tattler, and her job is to debunk all things mystical and magical.  Red is sent to Scotland to find out if the myth of the Finn Man is true or fiction.  In Red's opinion this does not even require a trip but since the paper is paying for it she is willing to go.  On her way out to the outer islands that make up Scotland her ferry is overtaken by a squall and she is washed overboard.  She is rescued by none other then Finn Man himself.  Nerus is held by a curse that he must marry a mortal in order to have his race continue.  The last time he had a mortal on his island she jumped to her death after finding out her man of her dreams was indeed a merman.  He is not willing to take another chance on that; problem is he finds himself totally drawn to Red in ways he can't describe.  Red on the other hand feels that she is not the stuff of romance, and that no man in his right mind will be taken with her.  She is the ultimate tomboy.  Imagine her surprise to find herself attracted to the very handsome Nerus. After these two finally realize that they can't run away from their attraction to each other and give in to the wonder of what they feel Red finds out that the one thing she did not believe in is the one person that she has fallen in love with.  Nerus sends her away because he does not want the mortal population overrunning his island, but finds that he can't live without his Red. As a result he goes back to the human world and tries to get Red back before he dies.  Will she be willing to give up everything mortal to live in his world?  You must read the book to find out for yourself.<br />Like I stated before these are two wonderful stories and I can hardly wait to get started on the next book that I have by her, which is \\"To Tame A Viking\\".

This was a re-read for me but I loved it so much that I wanted to make sure I added my two cents worth in the review area!<br />This is a wonderful scottish romance full of the characteristics that made Julie Garwood a well-loved author in Historical Romance before her move to the romantic suspense genre.  In \\"The Bride\\" an English girl is wed to a Scotsman whom is rumored to have killed his first wife, or at least drove her to suicide.  Alec is strong, handsome, but fierce in both looks and manners.<br />Jamie is the youngest of the Baron's daughters and is the bride that Alec chooses per orders of King of Scotland, and King Henry of England.

With her gentle ways and forth right nature she sways the opinion of the Scots and they all come to care for her including her stubborn husband.<br />This book offers, laughter, tears, romance, and yes, suspense.

I feel that the looks to the past that they share with their reader are sweet and show the groundwork for the romance that is soon to follow and as a result these little memories were a favorite part of mine.<br />Parris has always loved Dominick so she is hurt when a series of events leads up to Doninick proposing to her witch of a sister Annabelle.  Rightly so Parris avoids Dominick and after the engagement between Doninick and Annabelle is called off, Dominick joins the army.  He leaves without telling Parris goodbye.<br />Eight years later both have grown up a bit more mentally and they find themselves back in each others lives.  The feelings that these two shared have not gone away.  The entire time Dominick was at war he thought of Parris, and at the same time Parris continued to care and think about Dominick.  This of course colors the their future relationship.<br />This is really a story about two people falling back in love with each other.  Their history plays a very large part in how they interact with each other.  I agree that with some of the other reviews that they had a serious communication problem, and as a result so much left unsaid became more of a problem.  Fear not these two finally get their act together and have a happily ever after.	2003-04-15

Not only were the main characters fun, but old favorites came back for a visit.<br />Not only was this a romance, but there was a whodunit mystery involved as well that was key to the plot of the story.  Justin was wrongly accused of killing a young girl.  As a result he was banished from England by his family no less.<br />Meg is American and is a woman that knows her own mind or so she thinks.  She finds herself drawn to the \\"Devil Earl\\" and nothing seems to be able to keep her away.  As a result a great relationship is formed between these two strong willed people.  But, there is a dark side to this budding romance.  Meg will only settle for love, and Justin feels that love is something that could come in time, but not necessary for marriage, plus his reputation is not all that wonderful.  Despite this Meg is compromised by the dashing Justin and he offers her marriage, but Meg turns him down (How could she????)  But fear not Justin is a man that knows what he wants and he wants Meg. While he is busy sorting out his love life he also works to prove that he did not murdered Ophelia.

I think that this was due in large part because of the actual characters.<br />Nate Callahan is a ladies man.  The reader will be aware of this trait if you have read the previous two books in the series.  He was also very likable which is why I feel that his pairing with sarcastic, acid tongue, tough as nails I need to prove myself Regan Hart was a mismatch in my opinion.  Although many may find a strong willed heroine enjoyable I found her to be too abrasive and unlikeable.<br />As a result I did not find the romance as interesting as I found the mystery surrounding Regan's mother's death.  This book was saved by my opinion by the Callahan brother's and other character's that we have been introduced to throughout the trilogy. If you have not read the previous titles in this series, do yourself a favor and get them.  They are worth the time it takes to read them.	2003-04-11

Not only is the time period one of my favorites (American Colony 1730's) the chemisty between Alec/Cole and Cassie is wonderful!<br />This book is full of the historical details that seperate historical romances from the contemporary romances.  This book is lush in detail and Ms. Clare is true to the historical content and the use of slaves/bondsmen without going into to much detail that may be uncomfortable for some readers.<br />Alec is an English Gentleman who has been abducted and forced onto a slaver.  This ship is headed for the American colonies.  When he arrives he is extremly ill and has no memory of what transpired to bring him to the shores of America.  Cassie purchases his bond and nurses him back to health.  When Alec comes to his scense he tries to tell everyone that there has been a big mistake and he is not Cole Braden defiler of women.  Cassie does not believe him at first but allows him to send a letter to England to verify the fact that he is not telling the truth.  While they wait for an answer he promises not to run away and that he will work for her.<br />Cassie is automatically drawn to the dark handsome stranger who claims to be more then just a bondsman.  While waiting for a response to his letter they get to know each other and admire the different traits that make them both so different.  Soon they are in love but love between a free woman and a bond servant is against the law.  Still these two find themselves together.  Does Alec finally prove that he is innocent, and can he show Cassie that marriage is not a death sentence?  The answer is yes but there are many hurdles these two must overcome before their happily ever after.<br />Again this book was wonderful and I was sorry to see it come to an end.

Still there was great chemistry between Meg and Parker, great laughs, and of course the happy ending.  Ms. North is a very talented author and I look forward to reading more of her stories.	2003-04-08

I was so excited when it finally came in the mail that I put the book that I was in the middle of down, turned off the T.V., forget about my classwork that had to be done, laundry that had to be folded, and sat down for a nice relaxing read!  I have read all three books so far \\"Forbidden\\" drew me in, and \\"Friendly Enemies\\" hooked me!  I will be so sorry to see the end of this series come.<br />This story picked up right where \\"Forbidden\\" left off and concentrated mainly on Gabe and Nouri and their growing relationship (I was thrilled about this) and the different aspects of the mystery of the murders on Lambert, and the threats against Nouri coming together.  The gang is all here Charles, Clint, Genna, Steven, Mai Li, and so on.  If you have been reading this series you really don't want to miss this book.<br />I must say Kudos to Ms. Murray, she has now become an author that I will buy just because her name is on the cover!  Thanks for such an entertaining few hours away from lifes normal doings!	2003-04-05

Since I am a huge fan of this author I was obviously looking forward to her newest release especially since it has been several years since she has had a new book to offer!  With that said if you are an old fan of this talented author this book will be a large departure for you from what you have come to expect from JM.<br />With this book JM has taken a turn to the Romantic Suspense genre that is now so popular.  A young broadway actress Leigh Manning is involved in a horrid accident on the way to her husbands new mountain retreat.  When she wakes she is in the hospital and no one will tell her where her husband Logan is.<br />Logan has disappeared and no one can find him.  He has not called his wife, and she has no idea where he is.  The police have been called in to investigate not only the accident, but the missing Logan. There are some things that are not adding up and the police start to begin to think that maybe Leigh may be involved in his missing act.  Then he is found dead and there are not more questions.  Who killed Logan Manning, and why.<br />Leigh can't believe that her husband is dead, but the more that she learns about her husband during the course of the investigation the more she realizes that she did not know her husband at all.  Then a man from her past Michael begins helping her.  She finds herself drawn to the dark, handsome man with a shady past.  Despite the fallout from getting involved with Michael, Leigh throws caution to the wind and follows her heart to the one man she should have always been with. Together they face off the press, police, and the one person who has vowed to make Michael's life a living nightmare.<br />This book is more of a mainstream novel then romance novel.  The secondary characters in the form of the police investigators are great and the second storyline revolving around Mack and Sam is just as entertaining as the main storyline.  This is not typical JM story, and the character formation is much different from what you are going to be used to regarding this author.  At times the story was a bit slow, but overall it was still worth reading. Some old friends from her earlier contemporary romance books are mentioned but don't play a large part in the book. The suspense in the form of who killed Logan, and Leigh's stalker is not all the suspenseful and point in fact the stalker storyline is just about forgotten.  If you are new to JM take a look at some of her older books such as \\"Something Wonderful\\" or \\"Whitney My Love\\" to get an understanding of how this author has changed. Still overall this was a good book and I am glad to see Ms. McNaught is back to writing entertaining books.hat you are going to be used to regarding this author.

She has such witty characters, dialogue, and storylines that you are easily sucked into her world!<br />In See Jane Score we re-visit the game of hockey and the Seattle Chinooks hockey team.<br />Jane Alcott is a writer who is responsible for writing a colum about living a Single Girl existance and she also writes a steamy on going story of Honey Pie.  While Jane is creative in her writing she is not creative in real life.  In fact she only wears gray, black, and white and lives the life of a nun.  All this is about to change for Jane when she accepts a part-time job as a sports reporter that covers the Chinooks games.  Of course Jane knows nothing about the game but that can be fixed.<br />Luc \\"Lucky\\" Martineau is the goalie for the Chinooks, he is big, bad, and wanted by the women.  He also has no need for reporters especially the female variety.  Just wait until he gets a look at Jane.  She is a mouse, has no idea how to dress, and worse knows nothing about his sport--yet he finds himself drawn to the reporter and that is not good!<br />Of course both Jane and Luc have enough emotional baggage that would choke an elephant and of course this will be carried into the budding relationship that grows between these two people but fear not there is a happy ending!  And their struggle with this extra stuff is funny, touching and just plain fun to read about!<br />This was a great book and it was full of Ms. Gibson's trademark wit and humor!  The chemistry between the two characters is beyond hot and you will find yourself unable to put the book down!	2003-03-26

This was book four in the Knight series that this author is currently penning.  This is the story of the little sister Jacinda and it was a wonderful read.<br />Jacinda is getting ready to run away from a marriage that she does not want.  With plenty of planning she runs away to a coaching inn and this is where her plan falls apart.  She is approached by a street child for a few pennies, instead of taking the offered coin he swipes her whole coin bag.  Well, of course Jacinda will not sit for that so she gives chase.  The end result is that she ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time and witnesses a gang fight.  The end result is she finds herself face to face with Billy Blade!  Billy is everything that she should stay away from but Jacinda sees something in this man after spending time with him at his home after the gang fight that she can't forget.<br />Billy can't believe his eyes when he uncovers and angel in a garbage heap after a gang fight.  He takes her back with him to his headquarters in order to get her away from the scene and in order to find out who she is and get her back to where she belongs.  It's not long though after spending time with her that he finds himself wishing for things that he has no business wishing for.<br />Before these two realize it their worlds come together.  Billy Blade is really an Earl that ran away from an abusive family situation and then ended up on the streets of London.  After being captured by Bow Street Billy is sent to Newgate, he is scheduled to hang but agrees to leave behind his past to accept his future and accept the title he turned his back on.  This decision leads Billy right to Jacinda.  Can these two different people find love with each other?<br />This was a great story and I think it may be my favorite so far! Jacinda and Billy are caught between two worlds yet still find things in each other to love and like.  Still there are issues that each carries with them that color any future relationship that either may have.  The fact that Billy and Jacinda act true to their individual natures was wonderful to read, as was reading about them falling in love.  This book is well worth picking up and investing time in reading.  You won't be disappointed!her may have.

This story brings back some old friends from previous book and introduces you to some new ones.<br />Althought this story was a bit more sad or bittersweet then some of her other books it will still touch your heart and is well worth the read.<br />Sin feels that he has no family.  He has always been left to his own.  He is an advisor to Henry King of England and Henry has asked him to marry.  Not only marry but marry a scottish lass.  This is his plan to secure peace up in Scotland.  Sin would rather rot then return to the Highlands.  He has very few fond memories of his time there but he tells Henry he will marry the lady if he can find a priest to marry them.<br />Callie is living under the protection of the King.  She misses her highlands and will do whatever she must to go home.  She is in the process of running away when she runs literally into Sin.  Little does Callie know that she has run into the arms of her future husband.  Eventually she marries Sin ( I don't want to give part of the plot away) and vows to find this poor mans heart despite the fact that Sin claims that he does not have one.<br />Together they head to Scotland to bring peace and end the raid that have been led by an unknown Scot.  Sin also does his best to keep himself isolated from his determined bride.  Unfortunatly Sin does not realize how stubborn Callie can be.  Callie is willing to do all that she can to bring about peace, and end the unwelcome feelings that her clan has about Sin.<br />This story is not as fast paced as many of this authors previous books but it is still great.  You will remember Sin from the last MacAllister book.  He is the...brother to Braden, Lochlan, and Ewan.  You will be re-introduced to Draven and his lady Emily (Master of Desire) and of course Draven's brother Simon.  I must say the Ms. MacGregor has done it again!	2003-03-22

I have been a fan of this incredible author from her very beginning as a historical romance author.  She has now moved to the suspense/romance genre and her talent here is first rate!<br />Sabrina Radcliffe is the daughter of two very talented people.  Her mother and grandparents are Beacon Hill Boston, and Sabrina has become a sucess in her own right.  She is approached by Dylan Newport the lawyer of Ruisseau a very successful company which just so happens to be owned by Sabrina's father Carson Brooks.<br />Carson has reached the age of 50 and he is sorry that he never got married and settled down.  He remembers that he was a sperm donor that was pre-selected by Sabrina's mother.  He now wants to find out if a child resulted from that donation.  After he is shot in the back he askes his friend and lawyer Dylan to find out and to bring the child back.<br />Dylan thinks highly of Carson and will do anything for him.  He goes out on this search and finds himself face to face with Sabrina.  He passes on the request for the meeting which now must take place in an ICU unit in New York.  Sabrina accepts and together they go back to New York to introduce Sabrina to her new dad.<br />Of course there is intrigue, who shot Carson, why, and the suspect list is long and keeps getting longer.  Then an attempt is made on Sabrina's life.  Could these attempts be due to the creation of C'est Moi the newest fragrance to take the States and Europe by storm or is it due to something more personal?<br />Although the story lags at times it is still saved by the colorful characters.  Dylan and Sabrina have great chemistry between the two of them and Carson and Sabrina's mom also are fun together.  If you are an Andrea Kane fan you will not want to miss adding this one to your personal library.	2003-03-21

I love how Ms. Skye brings back old friends from her previous novels and entwine them with new friends.  This story is no different.<br />We met Taylor briefly in My Spy.  Well, now this stubborn spitfire has her own story.<br />Taylor is an author that really gets into her research regarding the different aspects and quirks of her characters.  Her latest venture has her scaling mountains while rock climbing.  Her friend and rock climbing teacher Candace asks Taylor during a climb is she would follow her boyfriend.  She thinks that he may be up to no good.  Taylor can't resist a challenge and agrees.  Unfortunatly before the end of the climb trouble strikes and Taylor and Candace have an equipment failure.  As a result of the ER visit that they each have Taylor forgets about her promise to stalk Candaces boyfriend.  Taylor goes home and meets her new sexy, able to cook, new neighbor Jack Broussard.  WOW!  Unfortunatly the bad guys have not forgotten Taylor, and she finds herself in all kinds of trouble at different times. Jack for some reason always seems to be around to save her bacon.  Taylor does not understand how this is possible.<br />Jack has been called in to protect Taylor.  She has come under the microscope of the government due to her friendship with Candace and Candace's relationship with Harris Rains.  Taylor is totally unaware that her brother-in-law Sam (My Spy) has requested that she be protected from herself.  This is not going to be an easy job, Taylor is stubborn and does not easily take orders, even when it could mean that it could save her life.  Plus there is the added problem that Jack is finding himself drawn to Taylor despite her sassy mouth.<br />Although this was at times an uneven read, it was still worthy of Ms. Skye.  Izzy is back yet again (When is this man finally going to get his story???) Sam, and Annie are back of course as well as friends from Almost Arizona yup you guessed it T.J. Mcall and Tess are back.  The chemistry between Taylor and Jack is explosive, and the suspense is at times nail biting.

I have read several of Ms. Holts books in the past so I bought this one sight unscene and without looking at reviews.  So I was disappointed by what I ended up reading.<br />This book really has three different storylines running at the same time.  There is the relationship between Gaberial and Elizabeth, Mary (Elizabeth's servant) and Elizabeths father, and then the father and his spoiled brat of a bride.  While all of these storylines were entertaining I felt that it may have been too many for one book.  Gaberial is not a likeable Hero.  Normally her hero's are dark and brooding, looking for the one that will change them, this just was not the case, he seemed more of an opportunist and less as a hero to me.  Elizabeth for all of that was just too unbelievable for words.<br />The end of the book was rushed and as a result the reason I feel that I came away feeling cheated not only by the story but by the author.  She has done so much better in the past.  Don't let this one put you off totally and if it is your first by this author pick up one of her later titles to see why I fell in love with her writing to begin with.  I hope her next effort is worth the wait.	2003-03-13

Let's face it there are more Ripper suspects then there were probable Ripper victims.  This is just going to have to be one of those cases that will never be solved with a true degree of certainty at this late date.<br />With that said I suppose Ms Cornwell's suspect could have as easily been Jack the Ripper as any of the others. I would not recommend this book if you are going to be overly critical of it.  Although I must admit that I am not sold on Sickert being Jack, it was still interesting to read the case that Ms. Cornwell put together. Her case is based on circumstancial evidence, but lets face it, at this point in time that is about all that is left.<br />Don't expect to come away with the case solved.  This is just one take on a very interesting and much talked about case.	2003-03-11

This was a fun collection for stories by four very talented authors with Lady Whistledown adding her observations throughout. All four stories are tied together and take place at the same time. And are set around the same activities.<br />In Susan Enoch's story a young girl is having a good time despite the fact that her betrothed is up in the wilds of Yorkshire.  Lady Whistledown's comment brings the marquis to London.  He realizes that he has been wrong in not coming sooner, and now he is set on winning his betrothed heart.<br />In Karen Hawkins story lifetime friends realize that what they feel for each other is more then friendship, but both are too hard-headed to realize this.  Good thing for Lady Whistledown.<br />In Mia Ryan's story a young girl who has a rough time at home finds herself drawn to the rogue that had her removed from her house when he inherited the title.  What she does not know is that his abrupt manner is not due to being rude, but due to an injury.  But fear not there is a happy ending for both of them.<br />And finally JQ thrills readers with a tale of finding love in the last place that you would look.  An Earl realizes that who he thought was an unsuitable person for marriage to his brother, is in fact the best person for his bride.  Of course Lady Whistledown has her say here as well.<br />This was a fast read that many will enjoy.  If you enjoy JQ's wit and have laughed over Lady Whistledown in the past you will love this set of stories.<br />Everyone has come to London for a small season due to the unseasonable cold weather.  The Thames has frozen over and this is a cause for celebration.  All four stories are set around the same activities and it is fun to follow the different directions each story takes.<br />If you have enjoyed Lady Whistledown in the past, then you will love these collection of stories.	2003-03-11

This was by far my favorite book in the series.  I read them out of order, which is something I always do but it did not matter.  Each story stands on it's own.  This story touched on all of my emotions, I cries, and I laughed out loud, I also admit to falling a little bit in love with Jesse the hero.<br />Diamond is the first to leave Cradle Creek after her gambler father dies.  She leaves after a chance meeting with Jesse Eagle a famous country singer that heard Diamond sing and knows that she has what it takes to make it in Nashville.  Diamond has stars in her eyes and despite the fact that she trust no man, she takes a gamble on Jesse, packs, and leaves that very same night.<br />Jesse heard Diamond sing the first time while she sang &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; at her fathers grave side and could not get her out of his mind.  He turns around and goes back to the small Tennessee mountain town and finds her right away singing in a dump.  He is compelled to take her back with him to Nashville, he know she will be a huge star.<br />Jesse and Diamond soon fall for each other, and their love is wonderful.  But there is someone in Jesse's world that thinks that Diamond will ruin it all and sets out to destroy her and her chances at making it big before she even gets a chance.  What this person does not know is how much these two love each other or the strength of will that they both have.  Love will win the day but not before both are put to the test.<br />This again was by far my favorite in the series, the characterization is wonderful, and the story basically tells it's self.  I managed to inhale this one in one night.  I hated to see it come to an end.  Trust me, you don't want to miss this one by a wonderful and talented author.	2003-03-09

She finds love were she least expects it and it's more touching and wonderful for that fact.<br />Queen is the oldest of three girls.  Her father has died, but even when he was alive he was not there for his girls.  He did manage to teach them not to trust men, slick comments, and things that seem to good to be true.  He was a gambler, and not a good one so they lived on the fringes of society in a small backwood Tennesse town, that is until Johnny dies and the girls decide that it is time to move on.  Queen bids farwell to her younger sisters as they each take a different road.  Queen gets on a bus and heads to Arizona.  She wants to be as far away from coal smoke and mountains as she can get.  Fate steps in and soon Queen finds herself headed toward Colorado and her destiny.<br />Cody Bonner has suffered much in his life.  He was an Air Force pilot but after the death of his wife he retires so he can be home with his 3 sons.  They have suffered cruelly at the hands of their grandmother and he will do anything to keep that woman away from his kids.  The grandmother feels that Cody is not fit to be a parent and has had the kids in and out of court trying to prove it.  A set of circumstances lead Cody's boys to a chance encounter with Queen.  From there the lessons that will be learned are heartwarming and are learned by all.  Love does save the day.<br />This is a wonderful book and a does justice to this strong willed, but soft on the inside woman.  This is second in the series of the Gamblers Daughter trilogy but stands alone if you have not read the first one.  Wonderful characterization, fast paced, and romantic.  A perfect way to spend the evening.	2003-03-09

She awakens in the water and finds herself being pulled onto a ship that looks like it has been painstakingly restored.  This ship comes complete with pirates and a Captain who's just about the biggest hunk that she has ever seen.<br />Captain Andrew Spencer has been planning on the best way to payback an old nemesis and that is too steal his betrothed right out from under him so to speak.  He hears a faint cry for help over the side of his ship and pulls Carly out of the ocean , only problem is he thinks that she is Amanda.  The girl that he plans to ransom.  Once Carly starts talking Andrew now feels that he has been duped.  The poor girl is clearly not in her right mind she keeps asking for Ray Dio (radio) and keeps talking about flying machines! Yeah right--the girl is addled.<br />Andrew and Carly despite everything start feeling things for each other that would be best ignored.  Carly has her own past that has followed her back into history, and Andrew is coping with the guilt over the death of his mother and brother.  Where neither felt that anyone could love them they find a love more precious then anything that they have ever experienced--but is it strong enough to last through time?<br />This was a fast paced page turner.  Both Carly and Andrew were wonderful characters and I loved reading about them falling in love.  This book offers plenty of chuckles what with the word confusion of a modern day girl thrust into the early 1800's.  This was a great way to pass an afternoon.	2003-03-04

Since I had this information it was hard to believe that they were indeed falling in love with each other.

I think it was because more care went into the editing and I was not derailed by typos so I was able to enjoy the story more.  This is a continuation of the same characters from the first book.<br />This was a fast paced soap opera with mystery of the two Lambert murders still unsolved.  You met sexy (and my favorite) police detective Gabe Baldwin who seems to have a little more on the ball then say Clint, or Charles.  Gabe is a reluctant protector to Nouri and do the sparks ever fly between these two.  I can hardly wait until the third book is delivered to see if these two get together.<br />I am glad to see that Ms. Murray has lived up to her potential.  I was a little disappointed with \\"Thief of Hearts\\" but my faith has been restored with this title.  There are still some typos but these are easily overlooked since there aren't many and they are few and far between.

Matt walks away from her and does not look back but they both remember that snowy night at the airport. Although they exchange kisses they don't exchange names.<br />Two years later Billie comes home with Scott (Matt's son)for a visit. She is shocked by seeing the one man she has not been able to forget.  Matt is equally stunned and makes a promise to himself that if there is nothing between his son and this girl he will do whatever it takes to keep her this time.  Of course this is not what happens and just when you think Billie is going to allow herself a happy ending something else happens.  In the end Billie leaves and goes home to her dad.  This is a second part of the story and does explain how and why Billie acts the way she does.  See her dad has been emotionally abusing her for years.  She does not know how to trust.  Oh yes, she crys a lot.<br />One thing leads to another and Matt and Billie have a third shot at happiness but of course Billie is her worst own enemy agian but fear not the story does end with a happy ending.<br />This book is full of emotions but happiness is rare and I must agree with the views of another reviewer I don't highly that there are men out there like Matt and Scott.  These guys are more then story book hero's.  A couple of times the book dragged but eventually got back on track.  Have patience when reading and make sure to have Kleenex handy since tears are almost a guarantee.	2003-02-27

Well, Lucas has left the police force in Las Vegas and has moved to Plentiful Wyoming where he plans to retire and lick his wounds from his past police life. He lives in a cabin way off the beaten track and has Yogi, Boo Boo, and Snagglepuss just to mention a few of the local animal population that hang around him.  He loves Elvis and he has a huge problem!  He is attracted to a small red haired not to mention the towns favorite but flaky mystery bookstore owner.<br />Scarlett is as bold and as brazen as her name but is a total fruitcake.  She owns a mystery bookstore which makes sense due to the fact that she cut her teeth on Nancy Drew and her dead father was a well-known mystery writer.  Scarlett and her buddies the \\"slueths\\" see a mystery in every action and this leads to some pretty funny situations until an old cranky lady comes into Scarlett's bookstore and dies.  To add insult to injury the new hunk in town seems to be someone she can't get out of her mind, and this is a bad things since the \\"slueths\\" think that he is either a murder, or out to take the money from the wealthy widows in town.  But his kissessss make her toes tingle and makes it hard to breath.<br />This was a fast paced read with great laughs.  The characters regardless if they were the furry ones or the humans were great.  The mystery of the dead lady figures heavily into the story and is an asset. You don't want to miss Ms. Berg's latest story.	2003-02-25

This is the story of Damien the other Knight twin.  Damien is a troubled soul and feels that he is going slowly insane as a result of his military career.  He finds out that a fellow officer and friend has been killed and has \\"willed\\" his niece to Damian.  Damien does not have any idea what to do with a ward.  What does he know about children?  What he does not know is that Miranda is far from being a child she is a young woman of 19.<br />Miranda feels that she has been forgotten and no one wants her.  She has been left and forgotten in a horrid boarding school where she has experienced unspeakable things.  She escapes to the stage but still has to return to her miserable existance at the school.  Then a dark and handsome stranger comes and takes her away from all of her troubles.  What follows next is a story of the heart.<br />This was a wonderful, emotional read and I feel that is so far the best of the three stories that have been written about the Knight Brothers. Damien is a true Knight is every way possible and you can't help but fall in love with this tortured soul.	2003-02-21

This book covers all of them from the beginning (Norman Rule) to present day, and even takes a look at the future of the monarchy.  Short biographies on each monarch as well as color photos help put a face and personality to each monarch.<br />Don't expect this book to offer a detail explanation and action of each monarch since that would require the book to be way to extensive.  This is a brief intoduction to each and a wonderful first look.  This book is great for either pleasure reading, or reference material.	2003-02-20

She has managed to pen an emotionally charged read.<br />Samantha Carlyle and John Thomas (Johnny) have a past.  Together they grew up, they were best friends, and before Johnny went away to boot camp they became lovers for one night but circumstances beyond their control seperated them.  Both promised to always be there for each other.  Samantha calles on her best childhood friend to come and save her.  Someone is stalking her in Hollywood and no one not even the police believe there is someone out there wanting to kill her.<br />John Thomas receives the letter calling for his help and he does not hesitate to get on a plane for L.A. in order to help the only girl that he has ever loved.<br />John Thomas takes Samantha back home to Texas.  He is a sheriff of a small town and feels that he can keep Sam safe if she is away from L.A.  Once in Texas they start remembering the past that they both shared.  They are both fighting feeling that are powerful and deep. At the same time it looks like the stalker has followed them to Texas.  Samantha is now on edge and fearing for her life.<br />This was a wonderful read.  I love Ms. Sala's characters since they are very believable and you find yourself falling in love with them as you read their story.  I found myself surprised by whom the stalker was and was unable to guess it until the very end.  Be prepared to feel all the emotions that this book touches on.	2003-02-10

This is of course the third in a series and I have read the books out of order but that still does not matter.  The story stands on it's own!<br />This was a great story with wonderful, likeable characters!  Fluffy and Manny were wonderful secondary characters that really added to the story.<br />Lucky is a gamblers daughter that lived a hard life while growing up.  She and her sister's buried their dad and they each went there separate ways.  Lucky headed west and landed in Las Vegas Nevada \\"City of Sin\\".  Here she finds friends, (Manny, and Fluffy the retired showgirl who is in her 80's) and the love of her life. Before she can enjoy all of this there is some stuff she has to survive before it means anything, plus there are things that she needs to come to terms with as well.  This was a wonderful story of growth, forgiveness, and love.<br />Nick is everything that Lucky does not want in a man.  He is good looking, rich, and a gambler (his family owns a very successful casino that Lucky works at).  Yet she can't help but be drawn to this gentle loving man.  Nick will do all that he can to help Lucky heal, prove to Lucky that loving him is not the gamble that she thinks it is, and at the same time do all that he can to stay alive.  There is a man from his fathers past that is determined to ruin the Chenault's and killing Nick is not out of the question.<br />This was a great book and I can hardly wait until the other two in the series make to my mailbox.  It has definitely earned a place on my \\"keeper\\" bookshelf.  Fast paced, and touching with really likable characters and a tender love story is hard to find nowadays.

Michael is feeling left adrift by circumstances regarding his parents and then his brother's relationships and his place in life.  With his confusion he goes into a self-destruction mode.  He has no plans on ever loving a person and feels that love does not exists in the real world.  Lust yes love no.  All of his beliefs are about to be tested at this country orgy house party in the form of virginal Sarah Compton.<br />Sarah is a twenty-five year old virgin.  She has no idea that the house party that her brother has encouraged her to attend is no place for a respectable young woman.  She finds herself confronted by her sensuality and feelings that she has never experienced by a man so handsome she can't believe that he exists.<br />Reading about Sarah and Michael falling in love was a quite an undertaking.  Ms. Holt has created a very memorable dark and brooding hero in Michael.  He acts true to form and you can't help but root for the strong willed heroine and that she has success in  finally melting the ice around Michaels heart.  Although this book is very sensual in detail, and at times you just want to yell and scream at Michael to \\"wake up\\" and quit acting like a brat you will find it difficult to put down.  Michael is not an easy character to like. But  there is plenty of history that will be explained during the telling of the story that explains his behavior and his reactions to different situations.  The only complaint that I had was I felt that there was no closure regarding Rebecca and her actions during the story.	2003-02-07

He follows his brother into the war but decides that the Army is not for him he makes the choice to become a spy instead and fight the war on that front.  Damian feels that he has taken the wrong road and turns his back on his brother.  Lucian starts living his life then as if he really is a black hearted soul with no conscience.<br />Alice has lost her mother and father, and just recently her brother has come back from the war and dies from his injuries and now she is left with his wretched wife Caro and her nephew Harry whom she loves.  It is this love for her nephew that helps Alice and Lucian's paths cross.  Caro has gone to London and has plans to play the two Knight twins against each other.  Even though Damian does not act like he cares for Lucian, Lucian has no qualms about looking out for Damian and lets him see Caro for what she is.  A player and out for herself in all imaginable ways.  Caro follows Lucian to his home down near Bath to his secret society party.  Alice follows Caro there because Harry is sick and wants his mama.  What happens is that Alice ends up in the Grotto and Lucian thinks that she is a spy out to kill him.<br />Of course there is more that goes on but the end result is that Lucian sees something in Alice that he has not found in his life someone that cares regardless of the circumstances.  He makes a deal with her he will let Caro go home to Harry if Alice stays for a week.  He promises that nothing will happen she just needs to keep him company.  She stays and finds not only herself but also her best friend and Lucian finds his salvation.<br />This is a very romantic story with plenty of emotional moments.  Lucian allows himself to be seen not only as a strong hero but also as a human when he lets down his own emotional guards down.  There were many tender moments between Alice and Lucian and these moments were not between the sheets.

I have never read anything by this author before and I must admit that I will be adding Gaelen Foley to my list of authors that I will purchase just by their name being on the cover.<br />\\"The Duke\\" goes into a part of society that most romance novels skim or overlook altogether.  Belinda is a gentlemen scholar's daughter that has fallen on hard times.  Her father has been thrown into Fleet prison due to the workings of a not so nice Dolph Breckenridge and she has also lost her job at a finishing school and now is an orange seller in the East End also due to Dolph in his quest to own her.<br />Belinda during all of this manages to hold her head high and is very careful not to fall into the trap of having to entertain men until her innocence is cruelly taken from her.  Now she will do the one thing she promised herself she would never do and that is to become a courtesan.  She will find a protector and will forever be out of the reach of Dolph.<br />Robert \\"Hawk\\" Hawkscliff is a Duke that loved from a far and has now been asked to find the killer of Lucy the Earl of Coldfell's wife.  The Earl feels that the person responsible for his young wife's death is his nephew Dolph.  As a result Hawk learns about Dolph's obsession with Bel Hamilton and he feels that this the best way to get the guy so he goes after the girl. Together they work toward proving Dolph guilty of murder but at the same time learning things about each other as well as themeselves.<br />Robert is unprepared for the feelings that Bel inspires in him.  Belinda has promised herself that she will not fall in love.  Mistresses cannot be Duchesses but she is unable to stop the way she feels.  Robert also falls in love with Bel knowing that he must do what is right and that is not in following his heart.  Or does it? You will need to read the book to find out for yourself.  Trust me it is worth the read.<br />This book goes to the extremes that most romance books shy away from as I stated earlier.  Most heroine in romance novels are not part of the Demirep. I think it was due to this difference that I really liked the book.  Robert is true in many ways to the upper class and Belinda is a refreshing change from the spoiled society girls that you oftentimes come across.  Despite what she goes through she is still a good person.  It was fun to read about these two completely different people finding and falling in love with each other.  Due to experiences that Belinda went through Ms. Foley did not throw the two main characters together into bed but let nature take it's course which made their romance so much more believable.  I highly, highly recommend this story.  It will make you laugh, cry, and will just basically tug on your emotions.ine in romance novels are not part of the Demirep.

I must admit that I was not let down.<br />Sophie and Mick are social opposites.  Mick is a London Inspector Detective with Scotland Yard.  He is a  man that has just celebrated his thirty six birthday does not have a family and has watched his best friends marry, have kids and live the life that he wants to have.<br />Sophie is genteel poor, has a witch of an older sister, and a harridan for a mother, and lives with her aunt who thinks that she is the reincarnated Cleopatra.  She also has the gift of second sight and she feels that no man is ever going to want to marry her because as her sister has told her repeatedly she is a freak.  Sophie would have just gone about her business but she could not live with herself if she did not go to Scotland Yard and report the murder that she has `dreamt' about.  When she is in the process of reporting the crime she looks up and sees the object of the murder only he is alive and well and he is Mick.  Mick of course does not believe anything that he can not see and thinks that Sophie's act is a birthday prank and goes about his business but on the way home someone tries to kill him but instead of believing Sophie's gift he thinks that Sophie is involved the attempt to kill him  This belief leads him to moving into Sophie's aunts boarding house, and into a working relationship between Mick and his unlikely witness Sophie to find a killer that calls himself Heart Eater.<br />This was a fast read with plenty of suspense as to who is killing London Policemen and lets not forget the romance between Sophie and Mick.  Their romance is sweet, tender, and sensual and wonderful to read.  I especially liked the dancing scene between Mick and Sophie at the ball.  It was probably the most tender moment of the book and I must admit to falling a little bit in love with Mick myself at this point.  Add this story to your must read list you won't be disappointed!	2003-01-31

This was not one of Ms. Davis's best stories but it is still worth reading.  This story was at times hard to read.  There were so many possible bad guys, Jason, Frank, maybe Vanessa, or even our hero John that it was hard to tell in which direction the story was going to go and I came close to not caring one way or another.  I think that there were too many different side stories and they took away from the main plot. Still the relationship between the two main characters was good and worth reading about.<br />CEO Johnathan Brighton was shot in the head and lives but has memory loss regarding what he was doing the last few days before his shooting.  He was found in Mexico and no one close to him claims to know why he was there.<br />FBI agent Katie Cavanaugh has gone under cover to find out what John remembers and what roll he played in the death of one of his employees.  She has a past and needs to redeem herself and prove that she has what it takes to be a good agent.  Trouble is John and Katie are drawn to each other.  How can she be attracted to the suspect? still despite all efforts their attraction is too strong to ignore and they can't stay away from each other.  John wants to be a perfect man for Katie.  Katie is driven to prove that the love that they feel for each other is not based on lies and that John saw the real Katie not under cover Katie.<br />Again as I stated earlier John and Katie are both likeable characters and their relationship alone was enough to keep me coming back until the end.  And isn't that the reason to read a romance?  Don't expect the humor that has been in some of her other books, and the suspense although had potential just did not cut it for me.  If you are leary about paying for the book pick it up at a library.	2003-01-21

She has just been dumped by her long-term boyfriend (10 years) for someone else he can commit to.  She is now on location in Alaska for the last of her screenplays \\"Copkiller IV\\".  The problem is she finds herself with Hollywood badboy Jack Townsend after an incident involving a gun, helicopter, and a man off of his rocker lost on Mt. Kinley. Apparently she not the only one that wants him dead.  Actually not dead maybe maimed.  Not only is he an actor (the horror of that) but he also broke her best friends heart and this is the reason behind her thinking.<br />Jack is not what the tabloids or Hollywood has portrayed him to be.  In fact he would be glad to give up the glitter for a normal life and a chance to find the perfect someone.  Little does he know he is about to be trapped on a snowy mountain with that someone.<br />It was fun to read how theys two opposits come together and the laughs are plentiful.  Jack's mom and Lou's dad not to mention Alssandro the Yorkie add plenty of laughs as secondary characters.  This is a real treat that you don't want to miss.	2003-01-18

The story opens with Nina being left at the alter.  To add insult to injury while she is sitting in a car waiting to go home the church blows up.

Hannah and David &quot;Walker&quot; have a past together.  As children they lived in a orphanage and David was Hannah's protector.  He looked out for her even after he was adopted by a local family.  This story picks up where &quot;Walker's Widow&quot; left off.  David is back and he has brought his nephew to Hannah who is now all grown-up and the town teacher.  He is taking a chance since he is a half breed and his nephew is a full blooded comanche boy.  It would not look good for her to be keeping company with a man especially a half-breed.  Hannah does not see David as a half-anything.  He is the man that as a boy looked out for her.  He is also the only one that she has ever loved.<br />This was a great book.  I loved getting to know the characters.  It was fun reading about these two people getting to know each other again, and falling in love again with each other.  I did not feel that I had missed out by not reading any of the other stories by this talented author and that the story stood alone as it was.  A great way to pass an afternoon!	2003-01-11

This was a nice story and knowing who played what part in the story early was a nice surprise.  Although this story was not as tender or as thrilling for me as Whirlwind Wedding it was still nice to read a story about characters that I came to like from the previous book.<br />Alberta has come to England to pay back a debt of her dead husband.  Alberta is the childhood friend of Elizabeth (W.W.) and she is planning on seeing Elizabeth as well.  Elizabeth is unable to meet the boat when it arrives due to the fact that she is due to have a baby at anytime so she sends her brother-in-law Robert to meet the ship instead.<br />Robert is looking to get married but he wants \\"it\\".  That special something that his brother Austin has with Elizabeth, the same thing his parents had and the the same thing that his sister has.  Robert has had no luck in finding this until a drab dressed widow leaves the ship in the form of Alberta (Allie)<br />Allie does not understand why someone is trying to kill her and I must admit that she does appear clueless in many different situations but I could still not help liking her.<br />This was a fun story and it was nice to re-visit some old friends.	2003-01-09

This is the second book in the Callahan Brother's trilogy and book two is just as good as book one.<br />This is Finn's story.  Finn is a Special Agent for the FBI and for the last 18 months he has been consumed with the hunt for a sadistic serial killer that preys on young women.  Finally they have captured this killer and Finn manages to get a hold of him and beats the tar out of him.  As a result of this Finn is forced to take a leave of absence and he goes home to Blue Bayou.<br />Julia Summer is a famous actress on a well known soap opera.  Her character is less then upstanding in fact she gives a new meaning to soap vixen.  Of course this leads to one of her fans having trouble seperating her from her character.  Julia/Amanda is being stalked and the soap is planing on a on location shoot for the season final episode.  They are filming the story at Jack's plantation house in Blue Bayou and Julia needs a bodyguard.  Who better then an FBI agent on \\"vacation\\" as a favor to the mayor and Finn's younger brother Nate!<br />Both of these people find themselves drawn to each other but Finn has no plans on building a relationship.  He is to caught up in his nightmare of a career, and Julia is the product of free loving hippies who look down on the establishment.  It could never work.  Or could it?<br />This was a great story and I was glad to see that Ms. Ross built on the relationship and that Finn and Julia did not just fall into bed and into love.  It was a work in progress for most of the story and this in my opinion made it believable.  Still the chemistry between the two main characters was great and I read on looking forward to when they finally did get together.<br />This was a great second book that stood on it's own so if you have not read the first in the series you will not be left standing out in left field going Huh???  Ms. Ross ties things together nicely and this story was totally independant of the first.  Yes, Jack and Dani make a cameo and Nate of course plays a part in the story but for the most part the story is about Finn and Julia.  The only thing that I would have to say was not as exciting as it could have been was the stalking.  This was more of a vehicle to introduce the characters to each other and less as a vehicle to move the story along.  So don't expect a huge \\"who is the baddie\\" type story.course plays a part in the story but for the most part the story is about Finn and Julia.

The characters are well developed and the love story between India (Indy) and Nick is tender and realistic.<br />While India is looking for the killer of her brother she finds herself drawn to her brothers best friend and the last person to talk to Ry before he died.  On top of all of this is Corrie Ry's adopted daughter from a previous marriage.  Corrie is a great secondary character that helps move the plot along.<br />It was great to read a romance book that touched my emotions and was fun to read.

Set during the Regency period of England Lord Ruin finds himself married to a woman he normally would not consider after being found in a less the sterling way (you will just have to read the book).  What he did not plan on was enjoying his new wife both in and out of bed.  What a concept!  Plus there is the added suspense as Ruan looks for a killer that hunts his prey in the ton.<br />This was a fast paced read with great character development and a interesting plot.  It was refreshing to read a romance where the male character is the one fighting for the love of his life instead of the reverse.  It was very entertaining to read how this rogue worked for his lady's love.	2003-01-04

This draws Austin to her since he has been chased by women who want him only for his title.  Elizabeth is not impressed by what Austin is but more by who he is.  These two keep being thrown together and finally they are caught in a compromising position and marriage is the only answer.  Austin does not feel trapped by this need and Elizabeth feels that she is not good enough for him.  Together these two work together to solve the mystery of Austin's other brothers death and at the same time teach each other to trust and to love.<br />I really can't say enough about this book.  Ms D'Alessandro is swiftly becoming one of my favorite authors and I look forward to reading the sequel to this book.	2003-01-03

This story was not as good as some of her other suspense novels and at times I had a hard time focusing on the storyline.  The chemistry between the two main characters is good and more then makes up for the lack of suspense found between the pages of this story as well as the secondary characters that have direct links with the main characters Sasha, and Mick.<br />If you like Ms. Andersen then this will be a good novel for you to pick up.  Just don't expect it to be like her current books.  She was working up to the great storyteller that she has become.	2003-01-03

This was a dark, fast paced read that I found to be very entertaining but was let down by the lack of suspense.  I felt that although the chemistry between the two main characters was great there was a decided lack of suspense to be found.<br />This was a first time read for me by this author and so I am not sure of her ability to pen a great suspense.  Although there was plenty potential for the suspense to be more intense I feel that the author concentrated more on the relationship between the characters instead.<br />Still in all a good way to pass a rainy afternoon.	2003-01-02

The plot was a bit thin and at times I was not sympathetic to Raven.  I understood why she did what she did and why she felt the way she felt but after awhile I was thinking &quot;get over it and move on&quot;.  I am sure that this was not the way Ms. Jordan met for me to feel but there you have it.<br />The romance between the two main characters was a bit thin in the beginning and it took a long time before I felt that there was anything between them, and the plot as I stated earlier was also a bit thin.  The saving grace for me was a fact that characters from previous books in this series are part of this story, and it is set in a time period that I like.  This book also has the trademark sensuality that Ms. Jordan is famous for.  Still worth reading and I look forward to the next book in this series.	2002-12-23

Abigail seeks out James Stevens a wealthy ... member of London society with quite the reputation as a ladies man.  He will be perfect in describing what goes on between couples.  What neither of them expects are the feelings that develop between each other or the obstacles that keep them from being together.<br />This was a first time read for me by this author and I found her writing to be very entertaining.

Ms. Garwood first hooked me with her charming historical novels such as the Secret, and Saving Grace.  She has since moved on to pen the Romantic Suspense and Killjoy is the third in a series that began with Heartbreaker, and then was followed by Mercy.<br />Killjoy is the story of Dr. Mike's (heroine in Mercy) bother John Paul.  In this story the killer for hire Monk plays a large part in the story.  You will remember him from Mercy as well.  If you have not read the previous two books that is ok this story still manages to stand alone.  This story is fast paced but it is more supsense and on the edge of your seat reading with a little romance on the side.  This seems to be more of a mainstream novel then romance so fans of Ms. Garwood may be a little disappointed by this.  I found that the lack of romance was not a bad thing and made the romance between John Paul and Avery more believable since they were not falling into bed right away.  The story is well plotted and the character development is also well done.  The secondary story and characters add to the telling of the story instead of detracting from it.  All in all this is a very strong novel and worth the time it takes to read.	2002-12-20

These are two people that have loved before as young kids.  Fate and circumstances have separted these two but they have never fully fallen out of love with each other.  They now both find themselves back in Blue Bayou the small town that they each grew-up in now with each of them carrying their own emotional baggage and distrust from their past.<br />This was a great story that indeed has shades of Nora Roberts or earlier Sandra Brown stories.  Still, this author manages to pen a love story that is touching, unique and worth reading. The story is well developed and the reader has plenty of understanding regarding the past that these two lovers shared.  If you are a fan of the previous authors mentioned then you will no doubt like this story.  It really is a strong beginning for the next two books in the series.	2002-12-20

Not only is this going on but there is another rapist on the loose attacking young single women in their homes raping them, and leaving them behind only this time the victims live.

There are not that many Gothic Romances out there that are worth the time it takes to read.  I was glad that this book was an exception.  Set in post civil war Louisiana the story is about Catherine who comes to her sisters plantation at her sisters frantic request.  She has not seen Elizabeth in over seven years so Catherine does not know what to expect when she gets there.  When she arrives she finds that her sister is missing and there are many strange and scary incidents that follow and Elizabeth is later found dead.  Catherine finds that she is drawn to John her brother-in-law but does not know if she can trust him.  She finds out that she must listen to her heart and that John is the one that she is destined to love for all time.<br />This book is written in the first person so it is totally from Catherines perspective.  For this reason the reader does not get the thoughts of others so you should keep this in mind while reading.  Otherwise the reader my get frustrated by the actions of Catherine. With plenty of &quot;Southern Flavor&quot; and many twists and turns you won't know who's the &quot;bad guy&quot; or what the secrets are that are kept so well within the dark halls of the plantation until the very end.  This book is well written and a first for me by this author and I look forward to reading more by her real soon.	2002-12-01

She is responsible for the arrest of \\"the surgeon\\" the serial killer that had been hunting on the streets of Boston.<br />A year later and with many emotional as well as physical scars later Detective Rizzoli is called to another murder scene with chilling similarities to the Surgeon Case.  After the investigation gets under way FBI agent Gabriel Dean shows up and is given all access to the investigation.  Jane does not understand why he is there, he won't tell her anything but he does have the uncanny ability to know where to look for evidence and what kind of evidence to look for.  Then just when things start to get going Warren Hoyt \\"the surgeon\\" escapes from prison and looks to have hooked up with the Dominator.  Working together these two murders led investigators on a chase that includes some shocking twist and turns.<br />This was a well-written book that allowed you to get to \\"know\\" detective Rizzoli and perhaps even like her this time around.  The characters were all well developed and the use of medical terminology was not left undefined so a layperson could understand what was going on.  This is a sequel to the book \\"The Surgeon\\" but it can still stand-alone.  You will not have a hard time following the storyline or how characters interact with each other.  This was a true edge of your seat read but be aware that  some of the descriptions of murder scenes , and autopsies are very vivid.  A great read for the fan of Thrillers!	2002-11-26

In my opinion it made reading about them falling in love all the more pleasent.<br />If you like Lori Foster then you will like this author as well.

She is just getting on with her life in Boston when the unbelievable happens and women are being killed and tortured just as she had been while living and working in Savahanna. Thomas Moore is a detective and he has been assigned the Surgeon case.  He is on the trail of a serial killer that preys on women that have been raped in the past.  He tortures them before he kills them.  He finds himself not only fighting to find this monster before he kills again, but he finds himself drawn the Dr. Cordell.  How can he protect her and still remain focused on the task at hand?<br />The storyline is well plotted out and reads rather easily.  Although the author does use medical terminology the lay-person will not be left wonders \\"what did she just say?\\".  The terminology is used in such a way that you will understand what is going on.  The Suspense is first rate and the reader solves the case right along with the police.  If you have not read this author you are in for a real treat.	2002-11-25

I had a hard time recalling characters and the story line so for me this was like reading a new book. This was a great story full of the trademarks that make a Lisa Kleypas book a Lisa Kleypas book.  There is great chemistry between Max and Lysette and the story is fast paced and interesting.  Set during one of my personal favorite time periods (early 1800's) and in one of my favorite locations (New Orleans) Ms. Kleypas manages to include historic people in their own storyline that is not boring to the reader but at the same time manages to include main characters and move the story along.

It combines suspense, romance, and the paranormal and the final result is a page turning story.  Although you know who the bad person is early on in the story it is still suspenseful as you watch Dane and his partner with the help of Marlie track down the killer before he kills again.  Don't be put off by the paranormal aspect of the story.  You don't have to be a full believer to see it work in the story.<br />Marlie is a great heroine and a perfect foil for Dane.  She brings out his protective instincts and at the same time stands strong on her own.  The chemistry between these two is incredible and easily believable.

There is danger in the form of a person that wants control of Inverness and of course \\"the darkness\\" is always on the fringes looking in and waiting for the perfect time to cause trouble.  Tarek must choose between the love for his changeling bride or avenging his past.  The chemisty between the two main characters is great.  They don't just fall into bed and thats the end.  Their love grows and I feel that is why most people red romance.  This book has it all mystical legends, and romance.  This is a not to be missed story.  It is well worth your effort and time to get a hold of a copy!	2002-11-06

The story of this family is so tragic and this book covers both the personal and public lives of the last Tsar of Russia.  I found it very interesting with pictures that are from the families own personal albums plus newer picturs taken in present day.  This is a great book if you are interested in this part of history.  Beautifully put together it will make a great addition to any personal library.	2002-11-06

Full of personal photos, notes to each other, and other momentos of the Last imperial family with translations of the words of the notes, and plenty of full color plates.<br />Opening this book was almost like stepping into a museum dedicated to the last tsar of Russia and his family.

First off for those of you that like your novels steamy, hot, and sexy you will still find this within the pages of this story just not with the normal intensity that you normally find with other books by this author.<br />Ben and Sierra's story is really multi-layered story and Ms. Foster takes the time to build the story between the two characters and does not have them jumping into bed right off.  I feel that this adds to the story and the tension between the two main characters.<br />Ben loves women and he has a great respect for them.  Sierra has been taught by her one and only experience that men can be cruel and hurtful. Her ex-husband was abusive not only physically but mentally as well. He father did not care about her situation and turned his back on her. What sane woman would not be careful?  Ms. Foster is just being true to how a person would act in a similar situation.  Sierra is on her own and alone with the exception of her friend Kent.  Together they are starting her landscaping business.  Ben's own hotel is across the street from Sierra and the sparks fly between the two from the start.  Noah and Grace as well as \\"Aggie\\" are back in this story about love, family, and trust.  Together Ben and Sierra find out that loving someone does not weaken them and that trust is just as important as friendship.<br />The love scenes are hot and steamy but are part of the story not a vehicle to add filler. The side story of Kent and Ben's mother Brooke is also fun to read. This story is just as good as the first story \\"Too Much Temptation\\" and brings back some great characters.  You won't want to miss this story.	2002-11-03

In it you will meet some old friends from her previous story Absoulute Trouble, and some new friends as well.  This is a fast page turning story with witty dialogue, great sexual tension between the main characters, and an interesting topic for the background of the story. Set in one of my all time favorite places New Orleans Louisiana, you will get plenty of discriptive narration that helps set the scenes for the story. Those of you who have read this author before will not be let down, and for those of you who have not yet read a story by Ms Jerott/Albert are in for a treat!	2002-10-31

This was my first book by this author and will not be the last.  This book grabbed me from the first pages and did not let go.  This book was the perfect blend of romance, and suspense.  The characters were well developed and the author took time to explain things without dragging unwanted things into the narrative.<br />Olivia is blind but has the ability to connect with children that have been abducted and actually see where they are.  She has had this ability since she was rescued after she was abducted as a child.  Max is a cop that has seen too much and has been through too much.  After Olivia tries to get help for a young girl that she sees being taken Max and his partner Sam turn up on her doorstep almost postive that she is involved with the abduction of the little girl.  As the story continues Max realizes that Olivia is connected to him in a way that he never would have guessed, and he becomes a believer of her abilities and looks to her for help with the search of the little girl with the hope that they find her before the kidnapper kills her.<br />This story has so many twists and turns that you are kept hanging to see who the bad guy is.  The secondary characters are very much a part of the story and add to it rather then take away from it.  The author explains past history of each character so there is understanding as to why they act the way they do.  The heroine is not perfect and this in my opinion adds to the romance that grows between Olivia and Max.  This is a must read for fans of the romantic suspense genre trust me you won't be let down.	2002-10-29

The characters are great including the secondary characters, the pacing of the story is done real well, and there are enought twists and turns that the ending for me was a bit of a surpirse I don't mind saying.<br />This is a suspense story not a romance although Rebecca and Clay fall in love, there is no romantic scenes between them so those of you that are turned away from any type of romantic interest will not be disappointed by finding pages of soft looks, and discriptions of deep kisses.  In fact that portion of the story is so low key as to almost be non existant.  If you like suspense, murder, and a little of the paranormal you will like this book.  I can hardly wait until some other titles of this authors finally are delivered to my mail box!	2002-10-27

I feel that the main characters were underdeveloped and lacked depth.  They spent too little time together so I was confused as to when they fell in love with each other.  I also feel that too much effort was made on Adricks half-brother, his father and his stepmother this took away from the romance I think.  There was more fantasy then romance and the \\"magic\\" that was alluded to was a bomb.  I was really looking forward to reading a \\"fantasy, magic, romance\\" since this is a new genre for me I must admit to high hopes. I love to escape into different worlds with the author, in this case I felt forced into her world since it was not an all together pleasant experience to keep forcing myself not to just put the book down and walk away. I am not against reading books that are minus the romance, but when promised a love story it would be nice to read one that keeps me hooked.  I hope that this is not a promise of things to come for me and this genre.	2002-10-24

The story dragged several times and for this I give the story 3 stars.

First off it is a romance so if you are not a romantic at heart or don't care for the genre simple don't pick it up.  Second the characters of this story are quirky not unlike other characters by this author the difference is that both Johna and Georgie have their own personal baggage that helped to ceate who they were.  Yes, John seemed unable to have an emotional bone in his body at times but he was also having problems emotionally and with letting alcohol being used to numb his pain.  No one is at their best in that situation.  Georgie also had her own emotional problems and felt that she was not worthy of being loved.  Put these two types of people together and of course you will have problems making a relationship work.  This is what the story is about.<br />They started off seven years earlier Georgie was running away from a wedding and John the hockey player was the get away car driver.  Little did John know but Georgie was his bosses soon to be wife.  After a night of wild sex John leaves Georgie behind at the airport with out a backwards glance and with Georgie already in love with him.  Georgie is so convinced that no one will ever love her she almost has herself talked into flying back to Texas and getting on with her life.  A chance glance at a local want ad changes her mind and she stays in Seattle.<br />Seven years and a chance meeting later Georgie and John see each other.  Georgie is a grown up version of herself and John still remembers their one night together. Georgie is less then thrilled because she thinks that he knows about her little secret.  She had Johns daughter six years earlier.  The story goes on from there.<br />There are some great secondary characters such as Georgie and Johns daughter Lexie and Georgie's best friend Mae.<br />If you have read Ms. Gibson's later stories you will not find them to be the same.  I think that these characters were complex and Ms. Gibson was true to form in the way she wrote them.  Yes, there was a lot of I hate you, I lust after you....but, at the same time these are two people that have been hurt before and this would have an affect on how they interact with others.  Still this story was good, with some humor and laughs thrown in.  It would be a shame to miss this story if you are a fan of this author.will not find them to be the same.

It was slow to start and I had a hard time wanting to pick it back up after I had set it down.  The story was rather predictable and did bore me like I said earlier.  If this is your first time reading Ms. Kleypas don't judge her on this effort alone.  She is normally a very talented author.	2002-10-15

I am not a huge fan of vamipre stories but this one book has totally changed my mind.<br />We briefly met  Kyrian of Thrace in Fantasy Lover.  In this story he is a Dark-Hunter that goes after the really bad guys.  He has traded his soul to seek vengence on his wife, but unable to kill her he now walks the world in the shadows of night.<br />Amanda has powers that she is unaware of or unwilling to admit too.  She does not believe in the supernatural, or dark things.  She is an accountant and feels that she is not a part of her wild gypsy family. (Selena from Fantasy Lover is her sister)<br />These two unlikely people get paired together in a very unlikely situation.  As a result there are laughs aplenty, great romance, and a lot of the supernatural!  These two characters are perfect for each other.  Hunter does not give his trust easily, and Amanda is not even aware of her appeal.<br />You will not be let down by this fast page turning read.  Plenty of the trademark sensuality and humor that is Sherrilyn Kenyon can be found in this book.	2002-10-14

I am a fan of the romance genre, but I still was let down by this book. I wanted suspense/with a little bit of romance and I was very upset that it took more then half of the book to get around to the suspense part (it had such promise with the prologue) and that the effort that was put into the suspense was not very good.  I really was not compelled to continue reading.  There was no \\"hook\\" and I did not feel that I would miss out if I never picked the book up again. I feel that  this was really not a worthy effort by this talented authour. I am glad that I bought it used instead of new. If you want to read this borrow it from the library or a friend. Don't waste your money.	2002-10-14

She has the amazing ability to talk to a victim, walk a crime scene and produce a drawing that is a perfect likeness of the criminal.  Seattle women are currently being hunted by a serial rapist.  He is abducting the women, blinding them, and raping them leaving them for dead in abandon buildings.  Maggie has been unable to get a feel for this animal and is unable to assist the police since all of the victims have been unable to give any details except that he smells like Ivory soap and that he has a spearmint scented breath.<br />John is the brother of one of the victims of the blindfold rapist.  His sister Christine is dead by her own hand or so the police think.  John thinks otherwise and comes to Seattle to follow the investigation and bring in a few friends (Shadow Series) to help tract down the rapist before he starts killing as well.<br />The police have no clues as to who the rapist is and who he will strike next.  Their investigation takes them in all kinds of directions including the fact that these crimes are real similar to crimes that were unsolved from 1934.  The victims of the 1934 rapist look almost like twins to the present day victims.  What is the link?<br />First off I must admit to feeling that the ending was a bad one and did not seem to be well thought out almost as if Ms. Hooper forgot that she must wrap up the book soon.  Perhaps if there was at least a chapter to explain how the bad guy became the bad guy would have helped.  Trust me you will never guess who the killer is unless you read the end first.  The second thing that bothered me was the fact that there were a few parts of the story that I did not feel have closure and did not seem to have much to do with the story ending so why bother.  There was also the fact that there were a couple of characters that did not seem to really belong to the story.  They were introduced but they were never explained as to who they were, and what they were all about, and how they came to be involved in the investigation.  Otherwise this was still a good book with great suspense.  As for the killing, and the raping I don't feel that she went into incredible detail and I must admit to having read more graphic detail in other authors.  Be warned that this is more of a suspense thriller with a paranormal slant and less a romance.  There is romance between John and Maggie but it is a backseat storyline.  The sweet with the sour really.  Have an open mind when you read this story.  May not be 5 stars but it is still worth reading.hat there were a couple of characters that did not seem to really belong to the story.

I must admit to not having read any other stories by this author so I have not much to judge on what is considered good or bad and her work.<br />The story is set in Africa in a colony that is set up for the explicit joy and need for sex.  With murder, a flight across the desert with the bad guy close behind, Charles and Georgie indulge themselves with each other.  I feel that the main storyline suffers and as a result it is hard to understand where the storyline is going and where the sex is important to the story.  I realize that this is an erotic story but I have read other stories of this nature by other authors and the storylines have not suffered.  Sex for the sake of sex is not a story.	2002-10-09

Full of history, romance, and the mystical legend of Merlin made for a page turning romance.<br />The story between Vivian the daughter of Fire and Rorke FitzWarren knight to William Duke of Normandy is touching and has managed to become one of my favorite stories!  Vivian is the daughter of Merlin and she finds herself in the middle between the Norman's and the defeated Saxon's. Rorke is sent to find the healer with amazing powers and brings Vivian back to the battlefield to take care of William.  Rorke finds more then just a healer of the physical self but a healer of the heart and soul. This story takes place right after the battle of Hastings and is full of historical detail but not so much that you feel that it is a history lesson.  The story is touching and I found myself laughing and crying which in my opinion is always a sign of a GREAT book!  I look forward to the rest of this series to make it to my mail box!	2002-10-09

Although it does not measure up to her later titles (Ashes to Ashes for example) it is still not a waste of time to pick this book up and read it.<br />Yes, there is romance involved and personally I feel that it was an added benefit to the story.  It by no means overshadowed the storyline of murder in a small town where the Amish live together with the English.<br />This is really a multi-layer story about the main characters Dane and Elizabeth, the secondary characters, and changes that happen when the worst is seen in a town where everyone knows everyons business.<br />Murder is unheard of in the last thirty-three years in Still Water.  Now one of the leaders of this small community is found dead in his car.  The reasons behind this murder are many and the finger points at several people and at no one.  Elizabeth who just moved from Atlanta with her good looks, southern accent,troubled son, and has purchases the local news paper finds the body of the local money man and finds herself in the center of the investigatation.<br />Dane the local sheriff is a ex-football player turned law officer.  He is carrying around some old hurts from his past that color the way he looks at women like Elizabeth but he still can't avoid the attraction that he feels for her.  To make matters worse she is a suspect to the murder or at the very least a unsuspected witness.  Dane needs to solve the murder and at the same time protect his heart and the woman that threatnes his peacful existance.<br />Don't pick up this book thinking that it is only a suspense, but at the same time don't avoid it because of the romance involved.  At times it is slow going but it is still a well written story by an author that I feel has proven herself in later works.	2002-10-06

The Rose and the Shield is a follow up to Lily and the Sword and is set in England a year after the Norman invasion.<br />Rose is the very strong and independent mistress of Somerford and it's lands.  Her people have been under attack and she needs help but is afraid to ask for it from her overlord Radulf (Lily and the Sword) because she feels that this would be a sign of weakness and he would take the land away from her.  Rose has a understandable distrust for men and this is the reason for her not wanting to ask for help.  She sends a messenger out requesting mercenaries to come and assist her with those that are harassing her people.  The message is intercepted by Radulf and he believes that she is planning treason so he sends his best soldier Gunner to Somerford with the promise that if Gunner can prove the treason Gunner can have Somerford.<br />Gunner is tired of being a paid soldier and longs for home and hearth.  He comes to Somerford determined to win the land and a place that he can call is own.  What he does not plan on is the attraction that he feels for the mistress of Somerford and how that could effect his taking of the land.  Soon he realizes that Rose is not the one with treason on their mind and that she is just as much in danger as he is.  He becomes her shield and protects her from those that mean her harm.<br />This is a great story and the characters are very easy to like.  Gunner and Rose are the perfect complement to each other.  I found this story to be a fast read and I look forward to the next novel by the author.	2002-10-05

More suspense then Romance but the story is still very good.<br />This is a story about a serial killer that is killing dancers in Reno.  Amanda is a friend of one of his victims and is forced to identify her body.  Tristan is a Seattle cop that has been brought to Reno to head the task force.  He does not know how to handle himself around beautiful women and is shy.  These two people have a hard time coming together but they finally do despite the fact or because of the fact that the killer has decided to worship or idol Amanda.<br />As stated earlier and by other reviewers this story was slow going and it took over 100 pages for the two main characters to even warm up to each other.  This is really more of a suspense novel with a little romance on the side.  Don't look for this book to be like Ms. Andersen's later books.  Still this was a good story worth the time it took to read it.	2002-10-03

This storyline had so much potential but I found it difficult to care about the characters especailly Leslie.<br />Dr. Peter Havistock is one hot looking man and anthropologist his cermemonial g-string is getting more attention then Leslie and her family foundation is comfortable with.  Not only that but live on Harry King Live Peter announces that he is a virgin.  Leslie does not know how to handle that or the other things that come out of Peter's mouth.  The man has been living after all in the wilds of Papua New Guinea so maybe he is not aware of what should be talked or worn in public.<br />Leslie in my opinion is a little too uptight, a bit of a snob and as a result I had a hard time understanding why Peter would be drawn to her.  She is a Washington D.C. darling, daughter of a Senator and a divorced woman that seems to be more attatched to her ex-husband then she should, and to top it off she seems to have nothing in common with Peter.  There is little interaction between these two characters and the book does seem to be more about Leslie (as stated my another reviewer) and less about two people meeting and falling in love.  They say opposites attract but in this case it was hard to see where the attraction came from or how it was fed.  I must admit that I will think twice before picking up another book by this author	2002-09-30

The story of Alec and Keira is a story of second chance at love.<br />Alec left Freedom Arkansas looking for &quot;freedom&quot;.  What he left behind was the only girl that he has ever loved.  He is now back 10 years later as a member of ATF and undercover to protect that girl and hopefully be able to get out of Freedom with his heart intact.<br />Keira has stayed on in Freedom and has gotten on with life and has put the heartbreak of Alec behind her.  At least she thinks she has but when circumstances require Alec to come back and use her and their old relationship as a cover she finds out that she still loves him.<br />The suspense in the story is entwined and is built upon so there is a great ending in store for the reader.<br />This is a great sencond novel by this author and I can hardly wait for her next novel.  I hope that she is working on it now!	2002-09-29

I am a big fan of this storyteller and I can't say enough about her!<br />I liked this story for the fact that the heroine is not your normal &quot;beautiful&quot; girl that is found in most romance books.  Sammie is more &quot;real&quot;.  She wears glasses, likes science,and math, and is not accomplished in talking about fashion, or dancing.<br /><br />Eric is a handsome Earl and has promised himself that he will never marry.  He has seen the damage that can be done to everyone in a family when there is no love between husband and wife.  He has made it his job to look out for young women that are forced into a loveless marriage like his mom and sister have endured.  Eric is the perfect hero because he sees the beauty that is sammie on the inside.  This is just what a hero should do.  Once he meets Sammie nothing is as it should be for him.<br />The Bride Thief is a fast read with plenty of laughter, (not as much as in her other books but still you will smile) romance, and you will find yourself falling in love with the characters.	2002-09-27

I am a big fan of this author so I was a little let down by the fact that I did not care for this story.  It had great potential with a great mystery and I love her stories set down in the south.  This just did not live up to her other books.<br />I felt that I had come into the story in the middle from the very start.  The conversations between the characters were often confusing and at time there were too many characters speaking at the same time. Just as another review stated. All of this added to the uneven flow of the story.  This could have been all overlooked if the ending was better.  I feel that Ms. Carmeron ended the story too soon and that there was no closure for any of the characters in the story.  What happen to everyone and how did they handle the outcome????  I don't think a few more pages to &quot;wrap things up&quot; would have been out of order.  It could not of hurt in any event.	2002-09-27

Ms. Gardner is the queen of keeping you glued to the pages with twists and turns, murder, and a little romance on the side.  This was also my first time reading this author and I must say it won't be my last!<br />FBI Special Agent Pierce Quincy is being stalked by a killer.  His family is being butchered and he must find the one clue that will bring an end to the killing.  He askes Ex-Cop and friend Rainie Conner to help him investigate his first daughters death.  He is convinced that she did not kill herself in a car accident.<br />Rainie is tough, sweet, and has her own baggage and the history between these two is part of that. (this is from Ms, Gardners other novel The Third Victim)  She still goes back to Virginia to investigate the car accident and finds out things are not as they seem.<br />Don't pick up this book unless you have plenty of time to read.  I had a hard time putting it down.  Ms. Gardner keeps you guessing until the very end of the book as to who is the killer and why he is killing.  Don't pick this book up if you think there is a strong romance.  The romance is really a background story.  Still in all I am going to go back and read some of this authors older books.	2002-09-25

Despite the reviews I picked up a second hand copy just to see if what the previous reviewers thought was true.  Lets face it so many people can't be wrong.  This book was hard to finish and hard to understand why it was written.  The storyline seemed contrived and there was not an drop of magic to be found.  This story had so much more potential and I just wish some more time was taken in the writting process.  Don't let this turn you away from Ms. Hoag her later stories are still very good.	2002-09-23

Each story stands on it's own so you will not have had to have read the previous two titles (Kiss and Tell and Hide and Seek).

The characters are likeable and this is a sequal to Ms. Martin's Heartless so there are charcters from that story as well included here.  The problem with this story is that it became rather tiresome at the ending due to the fact that there was a complete lack of communication between the hero Clayton and his headstrong wife Kitt.  Although this could be a way to move a story along I felt that both characters being stubborn and unwilling to speak of their feelings for each other bordered on the unbelievable.  It almost seemed as if Ms. Martin was tring to fill up a page quota.  The end result was that I did not care much what happen between these two characters and only completed the book since I had invested so much time reading the previous 300 pages.  The fire may have been inside but it lacked heat needed to be combustable.	2002-09-19

If you are a fan of this talented author you will not be let down by this story.  Fast moving, and plenty of romance that Ms. Foster is famous for.

Well, there is a happy ending but I feel that it was a result of a formula that the author followed instead of her creative talent.  For those of you that have not read any stories by this author it will be a pleasant read but for those of you that are familiar with this author and what she is capable of will be a little disappointed in the end result of this story.

It is the first time she has been home in a long while and she does not know what to expect.  Max is not thrilled to see her.  In fact he would be thrilled to see the backside of her as she heads out of silence.  Somehow they both get caught up in the hunt for the killer stalking the people of Silence.<br />This is a paranormal thriller and romance does take a back seat in the storyline.  That is not to say that it is lacking either.  A good story that has many twists and turns.  You won't know who the killer is until the last moment (unless you cheat).	2002-08-31

I have enjoyed all of Julia London's books but this one was not as enjoyable as the others.<br />The characters although having promise just did not seem as strong as they could have been.  I was very disappointed in the characterization of Julian and claudia.  They went from likeable hero/heroine in their own book to what I can only describe as self-involved and unlikable.  This book was saved only in my opinion by the fact that it pulled on my emotions several times and required my to reach for my kleenex.  I appreciate the time period and the scandal that was attatched to those that sought divorce and the fact that society did indeed play a large part in lifestyle choices and the author being true to this concept.<br />All in all I would have to say that you will either love this book or dislike it. It is really something you will have to decide on your own.	2002-05-30

In several areas there were typos or just no direction and as a result I had a hard time determining whether it was a narration or a character speaking.  Plus there were a couple of areas that just did not flow real well. It was like the author was jumping around or lost focus about what she was writting about. The plot was good and had great potential and there was a deal of suspense but unfortunatly the hard spots made it difficult to follow.  If you are willing to overlook these items then by all means purchase the book. This author has potential and I hope that she lives up to this potential in the following books.	2002-05-13

He has turned his back on his wealthy San Francisco family and now lives in Oregon with his dog \\"Tough Guy\\" doing what he can to live down his past.  You see before Marla had married his brother they had been lovers and he never fully got over her.  Alex come up to Oregon and asked Nick to come home to help.

And then there is the problem with her feelings towards Nick.  How can she be so attracted to him and not his brother Alex?  Why is her daughter Cissy so upset with her?

There was an intensity between the two main characters but I got tired of waiting for the sparks to fly. It seemed to take to long to get to the meat of the problem between the two of them.  Eventually the story picked up and the mystery of the death at the Lady Rock was finally solved and there was the thing that you read romance stories for love, romance, loyalty. This is just a person opinion please take it in the spirit it was given. :)	2002-05-03

I am a huge fan and I buy her books simply due to the name on the cover and this will not change.<br />This is Brenna's story and is the conclusion to the coin series.

The characters are not at all likable the heroine is a spoiled brat that goes out of her way to be obnoxious and the hero not only puts up with her garbage but looks the other way.  I had a hard time finishing the story since the whole concept of these to unlikely people falling in love was just to much of a stretch.<br />If you have never read McNaught I would recommend you read a different book by her such as \\"Something Wonderful\\" or \\"Once and Always\\" in order to see what a great Mcnaught book is like.<br />Not everyone will agree with this review but I must say JM could have done much better.	2002-04-20

Sean sees her as all things wild and beautiful. But their future will be turbulant and there will be horrors that neither will be able to imagine as well as lose.  But in the end there is a happy ending.<br />Set during a turbulent time in history when it was \\"bad\\" to be Irish and foolish to admit that you were is a perfect back drop for this romance.  Evil things happened to good people and Henley is not afraid to write about history as it happen.  Sean and Emerald's story is a perfect example of how our individual experiences shape who we become.  Please don't be put off by the first couple of reviews.<br />As far as steamy sex scenes go I feel that those in this book are rather tame compared to other Henley novels.  Keep an open mind.  The characters are likeable and there is laughter and tears in this novel.  Yes, Henley shows a dark side of history that still has reprecutions even today. Despite what happens to these two people they still retain the ability to forgive, trust, and love.  Some of the most important things in the world.	2002-04-08

There were some slow parts and it took awhile for the main characters to come around to each other. (almost 100 pages).<br />Riley is the daughter of an up and coming presidential canidate.  Jake Mahoney is an newspaper reporter.  Sparks fly between the two of them at their first meeting.  Presidential princess vs. cynic newspaper man.  Minutes after the first introductions Jake's car is blown up and Riley is near it.  Was the bomb met for Jake or Riley?  There is also the added mystery of Caroline, Riley's older sister who has been dead for 20 years.  The mystery surrounding that will keep you turning the pages. Plus there is the suicide of the Police Cheif, the arson murder of the ADA, and the death of an ex-girlfriend. Not great publicity when one is the daughter of a presidential hopeful.  Riley keeps showing up at the wrong place at the wrong time.  Once Riley and Jake warm up to each other they burn up the pages with their passion.  The who done it will keep you guessing until the very end.  A great way to spend the weekend if you can get past the slow parts.	2002-04-07

The characters for the most part were nicely developed but situations within the story could have had better clarification or resolution sooner.  The relationship between Thane and Maggie had more promise I think.  Although there was a good narrative of their relationship from the past, the &quot;Present&quot; relationship could have been better formed.  They went from &quot;I love you&quot; to &quot;I can't trust you&quot; to &quot;I love you&quot; again with a lot of mistrust in between.  Maggie had been hurt so many times in the past that I found her reluctance to &quot;forgive and forget&quot; understandable.  What I did not understand was why the ends were tied up so fast without a whole lot communication between the two main characters.  This could have been done and added something extra to the book without letting the reader feel that the end was just cut off with no real &quot;closure&quot;.<br />Still overall a good suspense packed novel with real emotions, and an added bounus of the author touching on a very touchy subject.  A good book and worth the read.	2002-03-24

I feel that although the story had a dark theme, it was nice to find that something could come from it.  Both Michael and Anne had their own problems before either had met. The love (yes I do believe that they loved) was special in that both were  scared in different ways but each was able to see in the other something that was special.  I feel that that was what was important.<br />As far as the love scenes go I feel that they were very moving in the fact that both wanted to feel something, and in the fact that they both were able to give to each other.  I don't feel that they were clinical or gross. But they are not for the faint of heart either.<br />Ms. Schone writes about something that is very hard to talk about and her stories are always very moving. Yes, it was at times hard to understand what or who &quot;the man&quot; was in the story, but eventually it was all explained including why Michael was the way he was.<br />This book is worth taking the time to read. Don't be put off by the fact that it is an Erotic romance.  The book is more then sex scenes.  Ms. Schone is a talented writer and I look forward to reading more from her.	2001-12-29

The story and romance between Elizabeth and Ramiel is a powerful one, and the love scences are truly captivating.  It was also a departure for me as this did not have a young fresh out of the school room miss for the lead female role insted Elizabeth is a mother of two almost grown sons and she is not &quot;perfect&quot; and this was a nice change. Ramiel was still attracted to her with all of the changes that happen to a woman who has had children (stretch marks, fuller figure) I mean who wants to read about perfection when that is almost impossible to achieve. I feel that the story was well told. This is the first book of Schone's that I have read, and I will look forward to reading more from this talented author.	2001-12-27

The story between Freddie, Edward, and Florance is really quite touching, and gives you another point of view on a very personal topic.<br />The love story is touching a told in such a way that it keeps you turning the pages looking for a happy ending.  Edward finds Florance and works out a way for her to be introduced to his brother Freddie as a way to keep scandal from the family and as a way of protecting his brother, only problem is is that Edward has developed an attraction to Florance instantly but love for his brother prevents him from acting on this.<br />This is an author that I look forward to reading again in the future.	2001-12-27

Antonia is a likeable character (this is not always the case in Henley books) and Adam is typical male hero (Tall, Dark, Yummy).<br />After a sailing accident Antonia starts to play her twin brother Anthony after it is feared that he is lost at sea.  The two had been sailing together when a squall blew up.  She does this to save the family estate from falling into the hands of her underhanded and cruel cousin Bernard.  At the same time Adam is on his way back to England to set up home, and to take care and lead his wards. (Antonia and Anthony) The twins father is now dead and as named Savage their gardian.  An added twist to this is the fact that Savage just left Antonia's mom and is in fact plotting to make her his wife sometime in the future.<br />The story had great potential in the fact that there was intrigue, beautiful and exotic setting (Cylone,Venice during carnaval), tradmark Henley love scenes but over all the stories pace was slow.  It will take you over a hundred pages before &quot;Tony&quot; and Savage will even lay eyes on each other, and then almost to the end of the book before Savage finally realizes that &quot;Tony&quot; is a She not a He. Yes, some of this was information leading up to the end result but I feel that you could lose about a hundred pages and not lose the context of the story.  Not much romance between the two characters really.  But then how could there be when they are both suppose to be male and hetorosexual! And then there is the fact that Adam had been interested in Antonia's mom and this is not addressed again until much later on.<br />Overall I would have to say my rating is based on the fact that it is a Henley book, and I have almost always liked her stories.  She has the ability to take true history and true historical figures and intertwine them into a very good story.	2001-12-21

This is her second full length present day suspense romance.  The story of Connor and Julia is fast paced, and the sexual tension between the two is incredible.<br />The storyline of just who is the &quot;bad guy&quot; will keep you guessing.  Julia is Conners nephew's teacher. (Did you understand that) Anyhow she notices that his behavior is not the same.  Instead of being full of life and energy he is now acting withdrawn and quite.  Not the typical behaviour of a second grader. This is complicated by the fact that Brian's dad is the mayor of their town and is running for a senate seat.  At first thinking that the campaigne might have something to do with his withdrawal she keeps her silence until she reads a paper of Brian's which leads he to a conversation with the Uncle (Connor) sparks fly right away.<br />Again the story is fast paced with plenty to keep you turning the pages. Plenty of romance, and Andrea is true to her characteriztion in the fact that she does not allow any of them to turn their backs on each of there own individual morals.  It is a touching story.  One I don't think you should miss.	2001-12-21

Strong historic background during a turbulent portion of Scottish history.  This story still had the strong willed heroine named Valentina but she is likeable and realizes sooner rather then later that falling in love is not such a tragedy.  Ram is all man and is quite likeable as well. There of course is the stubborn interaction between both of these characters that seem to be a Henley trait, but is stops short of making the charcters unlikeable. With intrigue, secondary characters that are ghost (yes I did say ghost)that have their own story to tell and of course romance I found that this book was well worth the effort it takes to read it.	2001-12-12

Diana travels back in time from the rule of Mad King George to the time of Roman rule in England. Diana is intrigued with anything from the Elizabethan era and finds her contemporary male counterparts lacking.  While on a stroll from her plotting family she walks into a antique store and tries on for size a Roman Helmet.  The next thing she knows she is in Bath during Roman Rule.  While in Bath Diana falls in love with Roman General Marcus Magnus much to her dismay for to him she is nothing but a slave. But her situation can't come in between these two because they are soul mates and will experience many ups and downs before they will have their &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; ending. Such is the price when finding true love.<br />This is one of my favorite books by Henley.  The Characters are likeable, and Diana is not one of those insipid, selfish, nasty characters that sometime find there way into her novels.<br />There is plenty of suspense, and of course there are the love scenes that Virgina is famous for. There is also the hisoric information that I love about her books. You almost can see yourself in Bath during the rule of the Romans.  This is a book that I will keep.	2001-12-09

I have read several of Virginia Henley books and loved them, so I was quite surprised by how much I did not like this one.  In fact I had to force myself to finish the book. I only gave it 2 stars based on the historic information and the fact that I have in the past enjoyed her books. And there is the fact that I have visited several locations mentioned in the book.<br />I have read the other book in this series and loved them, in fact kept them on my shelf.  The characters in this book were so hard to like.  Especially Jasmine.  What a little brat.  Here she had a man that cared for her despite all of her faults.  Her headstrong ways kept getting her into trouble and she kept hoping for Falcon to come to her rescue.  Of course each time he came to her rescue what thanks did he get?  More spoiled, selfish, and nasty attitude. In fact he probably should of just let her get a taste of what she deserved!<br />Don't let this one book put you off Virginia Henley.  If you want to read a good book by her check out &quot;A Year and A Day&quot; or &quot;A Woman of Passion&quot;, and &quot;The Marriage Prize&quot;.  These books are worth the effort in reading.	2001-12-08

The story of Jared and Trish (Mac)is just great.  I did not read the other books in the series and I don't feel cheated. Although a few characters from previous stories in the series do appear I feel this story stands on its own.  A modern day girl sent back to the late 1800 in a classic fish out of water story. Jared is a Pinkerton detective searching for a serial killer. There is a twist, the killer travels back and forth between Mac's time and Jared's killing young, pure girls in both times. This stories offers lively and humourous dialogue between all the characters and Mac, a great romance, and suspense which makes this a real page turner.	2001-12-03

Set during the reign of Charles II Raurk and Cat's love story is a page turner.  A wonderful love story with a surprise twist at the end.  From the Court of Charles II to the wild wind swept Cornish coast to the wild and sexy pirate Rory this is a great love story. The characters are human and make mistakes but in the end what brings the characters together in the first place, ties them together in the end.  Rich with historic accounts of the Great London Fire, the Plauge, and the Dutch war and actual historic figures you will not be let down.	2001-11-02

I had to force myself to finish reading it. The characters are not likeable at all especially the heroine. And how can a book be good if you can't even find something likable about the characters. Rose is a spoiled, headstrong brat and not much more can be said about her. This really was not a very good effort. If you have not read any Virginia Henley books I suggest reading a different one.  If this had been my first I am sorry to say it may have been the last and that would have been a shame as she has written several others that I like and have kept for my own personal library.  This story will not be one that I keep!	2001-11-01

Intrigued is set during the Commonwealth Period of England. That is right after King Charles is executed by Cromwell and his ilk. This was a great book, and it shows that Bertrice loves history, and is not afraid to show it. From France to England, Vineyards, to Court, this is a great page turner, with lots of romance that Ms. Small is famous for. A must read for any Bertrice Small fan.	2001-09-23

I had run out of reading material and my friend loaned me her much read and mended book. I loved it, it had everything you read a romance for. Regan was a character that I could like. She was not silly, but at the same time she was not too hard. This book made me cry several times and that is always a sign of a good book. Set during a time period that I have never read before, and a harem... I must admit that I was not to sure, but don't let that put you off. It is a real page turner. The Love Slave is worth reading.	2001-09-23

Then again, Simon was a real person in English History and he did die in the rebellion. Readers should keep this in mind. Virginia would not be true to history if she re-wrote it.  The Marriage Prize is about Rosamond Marshal who has been betrothed to Rodger de Leyburn as a child.  She is a marriage prize due to her dowery.  Feeling that Rodger only wants her for her holdings, and not for love, she holds herself back after they are married. But Rodger arouses a passion in her that no other can. When Civil War breaks out she finds herself torn.  Does she side with her husband or does she remain loyal to her guardians Simon and Eleanor de Montfort?  A great read with a lot of historical facts, places, and people, as well as a wonderful and sensual romance that blooms for two strong people.	2001-08-07

Elizabeth vows to overcome her poverty as a child, and to one day own her own household. From that vow on Elizabeth experiences the lavish, colorful, and privilege of the Tudor court.  She experiences love and loss.  This book made me laugh and cry, several times.  A must read for any history fan or Virginia Henley fan.	2001-08-07

The story of Trenton and Ariana is great. Both are characters that you can care about. Trenton falls in love with Ariana despite her family connection to his enemy. There is tenderness to their love which I feel is an Andrea trademark. Ariana is naive but not to naive. There is goodness in her that draws Trenton.  There is also  suspense which causes this book to be quite the page turner. Plus you get to know his brother who has his own story Wishes in the Wind. If you have not yet read an Andrea Kane book this is a good one to introduce you to the magic that I feel is Andrea Kane.	2001-05-05
