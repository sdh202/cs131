It brings back the lyricism of the first two volumes. I thought in the volumes in between some of that earlier lyricism was sacrificed to the bitchiness of Proust's tone toward the aristocracy he was doubtless jealous of, and his askew view of love that stemmed from his obvious anxieties about having been homosexual. But the early lyrcism and charm of the first two volumes is largely revived in this final volume. And anyone interested in writing, as anyone who makes it to this final volume doubtless is, Proust's passages on the art of writing make rewarding reading.<BR>The obvious flaws are that some characters who'd earlier \\"died\\" show up alive in this volume. Couples who had numerous children in earlier volumes show up in this volume having only one child; Marcel (the narrator) recognizes people and then subsequently, in the same scene, doesn't recognize them. I have NOOO idea why some editor didn't knock out these discrepancies and tighten the text. It really seems silly to me to be SOOO faithful to Proust's final manuscript as to include glaring errors. Proust was rewriting  when he died. If he'd lived he would have corrected these errors and I think his intention should have been honored. But I'm still giving it five stars, since overall the experience of reading this last volume is of reading something truly brilliant.	2004-05-27

I'm not someone who sees every movie released, so I didn't see a lot of films mentioned in this book. My main interest was in the Robert Redford section, and the reputed dirt on him wasn't so bad. He's passive aggressive, and took advantage of his position to gain control of material, and didn't return calls and is chronically late. Not gossipy enough for my taste! The overrated Tarentino's delusions of grandeur were interesting to read about. But, just as a fan of the film, I was disappointed no mention of the film SPUN was included. SPUN is about as indie as you can get, and was the best indie film of the past five years.	2004-03-11

Like only a dedicated Beatles fan could probably tell the differences between the album LET IT BE and the recent &quot;newer&quot; 2003 version titled LET IT BE...NAKED, and appreciate them, too. A passing fan would think, &quot;What's the difference?&quot; So this book (if you've already read the earlier version) is for the dedicated Ringer reader only.

It's always laughable to me when people like Esterhas (and John Milius and Tom Clancy and G. Gordon Liddy) who worship at the the alter of machismo assume that all who read them share their same &quot;code&quot; and will be struck with awe at their &quot;impressive&quot; feats. So it impresses Esterhas that Robert Mitchum once exercised flatulence in the face of a woman on a plane who dared ask him to stop smoking. Wow! That Robert Mitchum is such a rebel! Ooooh! Ahhhhh!

Goldman's writing has gone off the boil in the past 15 years, so I don't know that he's in a position to hand out advice anymore. He blames the failure of GHOST AND THE DARKNESS on Michael Douglas having his part revamped. But Douglas' character is a SMALL part of that film, so to blame its failure on THAT is ludicrous. I know someone who was in on the production of GHOST AND THE DARKNESS before Goldman came aboard, and had hopes it would be a great film, because the true story itself is great. And then Goldman was assigned the writing. When I asked my friend how the script was, he said, &quot;Goldman wrote a terrible script.&quot; My friend was exasperated because it could have been great. And when I saw the film, I agreed with my friend. Goldman screwed it up. Douglas didn't help. It's probably his worst performace I've ever seen. But Goldman's mainly to blame.	2004-01-10

I just read an old Beatles interview where the Beatles themselves said when they weren't sure of a song's appeal, they would throw in a lot chords, figuring they'd dazzle the listener with the chord changes, while hiding the questionable tune itself. I had that feeling about this book, that when Amis is telling the sections of the story that are founded on a solid narrative, he writes straight and lucidly. When the narrative isn't of such sure footing, he tries to dazzle and distract the reader with oblique, recherch word play. I prefer clarity and a good story.	2003-12-21

It's puerile--as might be expected--and half-baked. And contrived. And the writing isn't great, only good. McDonell has been compared to Bret Easton Ellis (another rich kid). I never liked Bret Easton Ellis, either. So if you like him, maybe you'll like this.	2002-07-13

And some of the sections aren't interesting. But some of the book is earth-shakingly poignant. The bit that hit me was the author's describing the mind of the soldier who has seen such horror he knows God does not exist. And he makes a vow to abide by that belief. And then when he's shot and dying, the boyhood memory of a country church springs to mind and he yells, \\"Oh, God\\" and feels guilty at betraying his new found atheism.	2002-07-12

I had read in passing in a Norman Mailer interview that Latin men do not consider being the active one when having sex with another man homosexual. Only the passive one is considered gay. That seemed so absurd, I found it hard to belive. But this book makes that point and furthers it. In a way it's the foundation of the whole book. An extreme instance related in the book is of a man who had done a lot of penetrating of men, but had never been penetrated. But one night he was so drunk he allowed it to happen. The next day he found the man who had been his partner and shot him in the head. <br />As one joke that is told to the author goes, \\"What is the difference between a straight Latin and a gay Latin?\\" \\"Two drinks.\\"<br />The citing of passiveness encouraged in Latin women is interesting, too. The author herself fought that, and is a single professional middle-aged woman living alone in New York City, something that would marginalize her in her hometown in Colombia, but is accepted in New York.<br />Some of the book is tainted with the author's self-absorption and slight martyr complex. Her relating her losing her virginity is a bit too graphic and dramatic. But over all an interesting book. And if you're a typical American like me, who is rather shamefully less aware of the countries on either side of the States than he should be, you might read this book to find what is going on south of the border.	2002-06-02

I'm glad he decided differently, because I really enjoyed FIRE LOVER. The writing is good, it's gripping, and a good character study, too. It does slow down a bit during the trial, but obviously the prosecuting of the crimes is going to be less rivetting than the actually comitting of the crimes. An inadvertant red herring is thrown into the mix, that disappoints in the end. But Wambaugh couldn't change the facts just to suit me. But overall a fine book. I thought the GOLDEN ORANGE was so bad, I'd given up on Wambaugh and didn't bother to read FINNEGAN'S WEEK. But I'm glad I bothered to read FIRE LOVER. In reference to a previous comment of why didn't Wambaugh include photos and diagrams; Wambaugh has always based the style of his nonfiction books on Truman Capote's IN COLD BLOOD. When Wambaugh asked Capote why he didn't include photos, Capote said he wanted IN COLD BLOOD to read like novel, and have the narrative alone serve the reader, and Wambaugh has followed Capote's lead ever since.	2002-05-28

And he slams John Densmore again and again. Apparently Densmore slammed Manzarek in HIS book RIDERS ON THE STORM, and Manzarek got his revenge with this one. But I read RIDERS ON THE STORM and I only recall one dig about Densmore rolling his eyes at Manzerak treating the Doors like a religion. But this book has dig after dig after dig against Densmore. Apparently the Doors have considered touring with stand in singers, but the one thing interfering is Densmore's upset at this book. So Manzerak may have sabatoged that tour and can only blame himself. I actually saw Ray Manzerak play piano and tell stories at Muldoon's Irish Pub last year in Newport Beach, and he told interesting stories and only complimented the other Doors. I was bracing myself for him to slam Densmore as in this book. But he was very nice, and it was a great afternoon, and I really regret that the tone he took that afternoon, was not the tone he took in this book.	2002-05-27

I would have liked it if he had described a bit more the sweat and heat of running a business. And he says he retired at age 48. To me, retiring young is more along the lines of what Eddie Murphy said, &quot;I always knew I'd be a millionaire by age 21.&quot; That's young! And if Kiyosaki didn't retire until age 48 (and he retired on a fairly unimpressive five-figure passive income) EVEN THOUGH HE HAD BEEN COACHED BY HIS RICH DAD SINCE AGE 9, a reader older than 9 can tend to feel it's too late to start the multi-years process of getting rich, which for Kiyosaki involved being homeless in his late 30's.

The pages hold some interesting facts, for sure, but they are too few and far between. I applaud the sympathetic view of the \\"sluts.\\" I knew one in high school, lived across the hall from one my freshman year in college, and lived next door to one my sophomore year in college and these girls were not reputed to be sluts, they WERE sluts...very very promiscious. I never slept with any of them, but I knew them fairly well, and they were perfectly kind, generous decent people, who were trashed right and left by others because of their promiscuity. So, knowing that \\"sluts\\" can be perfectly decent people is why I wanted to read this book. So I appreciate its sypmathetic treatment of the subject matter, but thought the book itself just wasn't up to scratch. One thing this book didn't point out that I found evident in the \\"sluts\\" I knew is that they LOVED men. That is certainly a reason for their behavior. When talking to them about incidental things, I noticed they showed a much more intense interest in me, or thrilled more when I put my arm around them, and often found quite unattractive guys to be \\"cute\\" or \\"gorgeous.\\" The book should have included that detail of the \\"slut\\" traits.	2002-05-05

One reason is that Johnson has ARRIVED and is a senator. The previous two volumes dealt with the PURSUIT, which inevitably is more dramatic. Yes, the manipulations he pulls to increase his power in the Senate are interesting. And the history of the Senate itself is interesting (mostly). But the passing of legislation isn't as gripping. And I am not convinced that Johnson was compassionate. As James Rowe says to Johnson in this book, &quot;You'll never be President if you don't pass civil rights legislation.&quot; THAT'S why Johnson was pro-civil rights. Not because he was compassionate, but because he wanted to be President. Johnson was a border-line sociopath, if anything, bereft of compassion. This book is over 1,000 pages and could have been shorter. But it IS interesting and I do recommend it. Johnson is certainly a fascinating character to read about, and to read of his heart attack and his reaction to it is fascinating. Much else is fascinating in this book, too.	2002-05-02

The way the main character has to investigate the past for clues reminds me of my favorite thriller, Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE. I think this is among Clark's best, a real page turner. I can't help but think, too, that Clark was inspired--if that's the right word--by the real-life Michael Skakel case, where Skakel (in-law to the Kennedys) is only NOW on trial and being considered the murderer of Martha Moxley in the 1970's....Clark's DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL is a wonderful fictional version of a similar situation.	2002-04-18

It does have some minor flaws. The writing is slightly hysterical in spots. And I DO NOT buy the premise that Moses was a good-hearted man at the start, who was corrupted by power after he'd dirtied his hands. I think he was arrogant and power hungry from the start. <br />Incidentally, anyone who still harbors the illusion that the Kennedys were (are!) out for the public good should consider (on p. 1014) that when Moses purchased land owned by Robert Kennedy and his sisters Jean, Eunice and Patricia, for public works with municipal funds, even though all surrounding land was valued at $9.58 per square foot, Moses paid the Kennedys $62.88 per square foot. Moses the kiss-up, making spoiled rich kids even richer. Your tax dollars at work!<br />Unlike Lyndon Johnson, Moses was still alive when this book by Caro was published. In a \\"New Yorker\\" article a couple years ago, Caro said Moses slammed Caro in almost every speech Moses gave after its publication. I'm glad Moses had his history thrown in his face with this book.	2002-04-16

Fox's mouth. He said, &quot;I sacrificed my 20's in order to have my 30's.&quot; He figured becoming a major movie star and TV star and multi-millionaire was a &quot;sacrifice.&quot; And now he could retire at 30 with all his money and raise his kid. Typical annoying &quot;fame and fortune are painful&quot; junk that comes out of the mouths of so many stars. I would have loved to have traded places with him.

But it's just awful. The language is dated, (Hemingway said, &quot;All slang grows stale,&quot; and he's right!) and the writing is BAD. It's lousy writing! The pace is hyperkinetic, and not in some appealing Kerouac way. And the Reagan-bashing afterword written by Shulberg in 1989 is just bizarre, especially considering that Elia Kazan and Budd Shulberg wrote ON THE WATERFRONT as a metaphor for justifying their own naming names for the blacklist during the McCarthy-ish communist witch hunts. Shulberg pandered to right-wing extremism as much as a person can. Maybe that's WHY he wrote the Reagan-bashing afterword, as an absolution for his past sins. But it's too little, too late. Aside from that, the book is just lousy technically and aesthetically.	2002-03-18

Ellis is obviously a showboat. If he's so grand in his writing, I can see how he would be grand as a person, to the point of lying about military service to puff his image up. That this book won the Pulitzer Prize is nauseating. Michael Chabon's novel \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\\" won the Pultizer Prize for best novel, and it's a pompous, pretentious, affected, contrived, florid piece of gooey pap.

But I gave him credit for &quot;coming back.&quot; But he doesn't really elaborate on his comeback nearly to the extent the title suggests. So I was disappointed in that. I'm from L.A. where even the average burger-flipper runs into celebrities with frequency, so his name dropping of celebrites meant nothing to me. I really would have liked a more introspective analysis of his comeback, but didn't find it here. He's an overgrown boy, which is no sin, but also doesn't make for great reading. One thing he says that a very very wealthy friend of mine told me is to &quot;not depend on one source of income.&quot; So that's decent advice. Too bad more wasn't included.	2002-02-28

I thought the conclusion that he died of an asthma attack, considering the new revelations that Morrison died of a heroin overdose as revealed in Jerry Hopkins book THE LIZARD KING, ludicrous. It's like the bullfighter friend of Hemingway's I once read an interview with who said Hemingway died of an \\"accident\\" not suicide. That asthma is a much more acceptable cause of death than a herion overdose doesn't mean it's true. (And frankly I could care less about Pamela Courson.) But the new info and believable info here that I haven't read elsewhere is worth looking at.	2002-02-26

But Ringer insists that ONLY the &quot;three types&quot; exist. People who will try to deny you your reward (real estate commissions in his case) if given the chance.<br />Ringer mentions how naive he was when first in real estate. How he thought a handshake deal was enough to get him his due. Now, if HE were selling a piece of property and a broker did just a handshake deal with RINGER in his naive days, wouldn't Ringer have paid the broker the commission?<br />I find it hard to believe that never ever would someone actually refuse to fulfill a deal if it was agreed to over just a handshake.<br />In fact, screenwriter William Goldman in his new book WHICH LIE DID I TELL, says that only decades into his career was he not paid his writing fee for the first time and that MANY OF HIS PREVIOUS writing assignments had been sealed WITH JUST A HANDSHAKE. But he had been duly paid nonetheless.<br />This book is important to read. But very cyncial. And one should be armed with what's included for SOME situations, but not all, I think. I could be wrong. But I don't think so.	2002-02-14

It's presented as some timeless tome, but the writing isn't very good in spots, and the philosophy is good for SOME situations.<br />I read a book titled WHO PROSPERS by Laurence Harrison, that compares cultures, and he said certain third world cultures are often backward because of their corruption. In such cultures, wiliness and cunning and deception are the foundations for survival. I recall a Rwandan citizen in the NEW YORKER saying wistfully to the American journalist, \\"You people from the West are so HONEST.\\" So this book should help if you're dealing with a band of gypsys. (Or the Clintons!) But not when dealing with everyone.<br />Yes corrupt environments exist for sure! And advice from this book will certainly help in some situations in \\"honest\\" cultures. But really this book is largely about HOW TO THRIVE IN CORRUPT ENVIRONMENTS!<br />I live in Newport Beach, California, which is very affluent, and I know some very very wealthy people AND MANY OF THEM ACCUMULATED THEIR IMMENSE WEALTH THROUGH HONEST NON-DECEPTIVE MEANS. Not all, of course, but certainly some. <br />I like to think the authors of this book wrote it as a guide for SOME situations, but not all. Sort of the HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE for when dealing with the Corleone family.	2002-02-14

Franky, I'm a Beatles freak, and got the book just to read the chapter about Mia's experience meditating with the Beatles at the retreat in Rishikesh, India.

If you don't like the simplicity and &quot;fable&quot; quality of the book then you should stay away from all the Rich Dad books. Most of the techniques are very simple, but often simplicity is the best thing. I'm a literary writer and film maker, and admit to artistic snobbery that sneers at &quot;salesmanship.&quot; But I have to pitch my movie ideas and, whether I like it or not, that is &quot;sales.&quot; So, while part of me fought this book, the rest of me embraced it.	2002-01-31

If a lot of what he recommends here isn't already instinctive in you, you probably weren't meant to be an entrepreneur. He goes on endlessly about how you should be as silent as much as possible in negotiations. I went into negotiations after reading that thinking that's what I'd better do. Then I realized that's what I'd been doing the whole time without having to be told. An arrogance bleeds through the lines a bit too often. And being a sports agent, to me, is about as frivolous a profession as there could be. When I first heard the term &quot;sports agent&quot; I literally thought it was a joke. Bill Murray said the reason Mike Ovitz failed as an executive at Disney is, &quot;He went from a simple commission business as a talent agent to the much more complex business of Disney. That's why he failed.&quot; And McCormack runs a talent agency, basically. And a lot of readers will probably be involved in much more complex businesses, for whom his advice will be dubious at best. But with those major reservations, I still think it's a book worth reading.	2002-01-24

I read the hardcover version, and only got the paperback version after seeing that it has 30 additional pages added on. Well, if you've read the hardback version GET THE PAPERBACK VERSION, TOO, ANYWAY! The added chapters are worth it. The added chapter about Clinton's history as a rapist is astounding. I thought I knew all about that aspect of his history. And while Hitchens doesn't include the rape of Eileen Wellstone that got Clinton kicked out of Oxford that I've read of elsewhere, he includes the rape of a lawyer and an attempted rape of a San Francisco radical activist that I hadn't heard of before. And he documents well the rape of Juanita Broaddrick. One of the wonderful things about the book is that Hitchens has ready responses for the type of defenses and attacks Clinton-lovers bring up to counter points made by Clinton's critics. Anyway, my main point of this review is, again: even if you read the hardcover version of the book, BUY THE PAPERBACK VERSION, TOO, ANYWAY.	2002-01-24

I like the immediacey of collected interview quotes, so like the way this book was presented. It's an interesting look at Mailer's life. The bit that impressed me most, was the example of the liberal elite giving a free pass to Mailer for committing a violent crime because he was one of theirs. When Mailer stabbed his wife, sending her to the hospital for a good stay, and himself to an insane asylum, the New York liberal elite pretty much excused Mailer for his behavior! The cocktail party talk about Mailer in Fifth Ave apartments was that Norman must have been a little upset, etc. He was in their clique so it was okay! It was a total duplication of the liberal elites' excusing of Bill Clinton's raping Juanita Broaddrick (read Christopher Hitchens' book NO ONE LEFT TO LIE TO for more on that). Hitchens interviewed three women who independent of each other said Bill Clinton raped them. But the liberal elite excuses Bill Clinton because he's one of theirs! I can't help but think that being a member of the liberal elite is like being the member of a cult. Anyway, it's stuff like this that makes Manso's biography of Mailer worth reading.	2002-01-19

Something that should be standard practice should not have to be applauded! But the liberal press were such Clinton groupies, the truth was so hidden or distorted so often, this book is indeed one to be applauded. Aside from Clinton's sins being revealed, this book gives insight into the minds of the &quot;enablers&quot; who let Clinton get away with his crimes, or who looked the other way or defended him once they were committed. An excerpt from the book describes such Clinton supporters perfectly: &quot;I have known a number of people who work for and with, or who worked for and with, this man [Clinton]. They act like cult members while they are still under the spell, and talk like ex-cult members as soon as they have broken away.&quot;	2002-01-18

What Goldberg says in this book has gone on so long and been so glaringly obvious, that an insider a long time ago should have broken ranks as Goldberg has. The closest we've had until now is Tom Wolfe. But he's not exactly an insider. However, better late than never. I don't even have to click down (so I won't even bother!) to know that a lot of reviews below are one star reviews written by the very type people Goldberg is writing about. Their comments surely only further the points Goldberg makes!! The book does suffer from an often hysterical tone, that Goldberg's critics will surely point at to dismiss the entire text of the book. I'd have preferred him to have been a bit more even-tempered in his presentation. But what he presents is true. I fear, though, he's preaching to the converted. Let's hope this book results in some real and lasting change in journalism becoming more objective! But let's not hold out breaths, either! I'm thrilled this book is a bestseller. Dan Rather's vanity will probably never recover!	2002-01-10

A previous review below mentions the reader's disappointment that Goldberg violated his contract by writing his WSJ op-ed piece without prior permission from CBS. But not mentioned is Goldberg's very reasonable response, when called on this by a superior: &quot;I reminded him that others, including Dan Rather, had written controversial op-ed pieces without getting approval, and nothing ever happened to any of them.&quot; What Goldberg says has long needed saying.	2002-01-10

Frankly I'm kind of annoyed that this book was available when I was in grammar school, but I was taught math using the old tired and tedious methods we all know and hate. This book was published in 1966 and should have augmented, if not outright replaced, many math books in every classroom. This book should be a perennial bestseller. Even if you're a math whiz, this book will make you an even greater whiz.

Anyway, the story's sort of amusing. But the postmodern injections of Amis' own personal anecdotes (in a FICTION novel!!!) are jarring and out of place. Amis has confessed to egomania, but just because it's there, doesn't mean you have to display it. Some passages in this book are first rate, though. The plot can basically be summed up by Gore Vidal's famous line: &quot;When a friend succeeds, a little something in me dies.&quot;	2001-12-26

But I do think that just because a man is a billionaire, that his opinions elsewhere are not necessarily right. My philosophy professor in college said, &quot;Einstein was a genius at physics, but was a lousy philosopher.&quot; So Soros doesn't necessarily have a lock on the &quot;fate of the world.&quot; I read a book by a Robert Ringer that predicted the collapse of Western Civilization in the 1980's...that didn't happen. So I am not necessarily convinced with Soros' dire predictions.<br />And when he relates how his financial activities that hurt other people were not immoral, because, &quot;If I had not participated in this activity, someone else would have,&quot; I have to question how moral he is! You could take that down to the level of &quot;Well, SOMEONE was going to steal that unlocked bicycle outside Denny's, so it might as well have been me. And since it was going to get stolen ANYWAY, my stealing it wasn't immoral.&quot;<br />But there is definitely a lot of worthy food for thought in this book, so I do recommend it.	2001-10-26

I recall a &quot;20/20&quot; program where they put hidden cameras on a man and woman who were beautiful, and on a man and woman who were plain, and sent them out for job interviews WITH THE SAME RESUMES. The attractive man and woman got MANY more job offers than the plain pair. And these were not fashion-model jobs, but stock-brokerages etc., <br />I used to work in a plastic surgeon's office. One woman brought her baby in to have a cleft-lip repaired. The mother used to sit and read magazines in the waiting room while the baby cried next to her. After the baby's lip was fixed, and he now looked like a normal baby, that mother never touched a magazine in the waiting room, but cooed and cuddled him the whole wait. <br />BUT if looks were everything, how come John Lennon and Paul McCartney both in 1969--when John and Paul were arguably the most desirable men on the planet--married Yoko Ono and Linda McCartney?! Yoko and Linda were not that attractive!! But they snared two Beatles. I mean, I'm a nobody, and I don't think I'D even go out with Yoko or Linda. To each his own! So looks matter, but they ain't everything.<br />Anyway, this book delves into the appearance aspect of our species in an accessible manner, and I recommend it.	2001-10-17

My only complaint is the scene where Frederic Henry shoots and kills in cold blood two officers who are running away, going AWOL. But they are not in combat. They are in the middle of nowhere, so what's the real harm in them running away? It's a rotten, cold thing for Henry to do in that scene, and F. Scott Fitzgerald advised Hemingway to cut that scene. Hemingway branded Fitzgerald a wimp for wanting to cut out the violence, and left the scene in. But I think Fitzgerald was right. It's a brutal act, commited by a character that does not exhibit brutality elsewhere, and so doesn't fit. The rest of the book is great, though.	2001-10-14

So, from my admittedly naive perspective (knowing little military history), Hanson makes a convincing argument that Western cultural values are at the foundation of Western military victories over the millenia. I, personally, am fascinated by how seemingly incidental cultural values can have huge impacts on entire eras, countries, economies. So this book was of particular interest. I DO know a bit about business and management, and the same examples that almost invariably result in big BUSINESS successes, are the same ones Hanson claims lead to military victories, (individuality, relatively boudaryless hierarchies, freedom), so from that perspective, his claims make a LOT of sense. And I found of PARTICULAR interest, the chapter on Vietnam, where he claims the war was easily winnable. He takes a VERY politically incorrect view of the Vietnam war, for which I'm sure he'll get MAJOR flak. I, personally, found his take on the war refreshing, and even daring. Again, I don't know enough about Vietnam to judge whether his arguments are wrong or right. But he DOES back up his conclusions with statistics, facts, and quotes from those directly involved. A worthwhile read.	2001-10-04

This book reminds me of a guy in my fraternity who told me that it would be REALLY hard for me to get a date with a certain beautiful girl, because HE had courted her for 6 months, and she had never gone out with him, despite all his efforts. Despite his pessimism, this girl went out with me the first time I asked her! Terry Allen's business life is filled with fitful success, and a lot of failure. And he assumes your record of failure as an entrepreneur will duplicate his. He gives the old bromide, &quot;An entrepreneur works any 24 hours he wants to.&quot; (Few things are as tiresome as the entrepreneur-as-martyr.) So he assumes that EVERY entrepreneur is going to fail for years, and work all the time, before victory by attrition. One of my best friends from high school started a business right out of school...it did $1 million in sales its first year. He was on the FORBES 400 list eight years later with a net worth of over $1/2 a billion. He succeeded immediately, without experiencing failure, and he succeeded BIG. He also had a lot of free time off this entire time. Another friend of mine became very wealthy very young, and lives on a giant estate in the South of France. And he averages about 6 hours of work a day, not including the months he takes off to stay in his mansions around the world. And he is not retired. I know from my friends that you can become a very successful entrepreneur without killing yourself work-wise, and without failing over and over. Just because Terry Allen messed up so much, and had to declare bankruptcy twice, doesn't mean you will. He's a bizarre source to give &quot;advice&quot; it seems to me. Another entrepreneur who didn't fail repeatedly, and didn't wait years for success to finally hit, is Michael Dell. He started Dell Computers when he was 19 out of his dorm room, and did $6 million in sales its first year. Dell Computers grew and grew, with only a few slips, making him a billionaire while he was very young. He's been a billionaire for awhile, and he's STILL young. I saw him on PBS recently, and he says his work hours are about 8:30 to 5:00. These are his hours as CEO of a global, multi-billion dollar corporation!! NO CASH, NO FEAR has an occasional good piece of advice. But you'd do better to read Michael Dell's book DIRECT FROM DELL.

But the recent attempt at a John O'Hara revival failed for a reason. He's not that good. If you've read one O'Hara story, you've read them all. O'Hara's same obsessions are played out in every story. His two obsessions were 1) Status  2) The obsession with and assumption that if a male and female are left alone together, one will immediately try and jump the other's bones. Maybe I've led a dull life, but I've actually been left alone with girls and women when neither I nor they tried to bed the other. The other thing is O'Hara thought he was one of the greatest writers ever...but, by his own admission, was not that well read. He mainly read Hemingway and Fitzgerald over and over. Not bad role models at all. But O'Hara famously said in a review of a Hemingway book that Hemingway was the greatest writer since Shakespeare (suggesting, of course, that O'Hara was the SECOND greatest writer since Shakespeare!). But O'Hara once responsed to a critic who said his writing resembled Tolstoy's (pulEEASE!) that, \\"Gee, I've never even READ Tolstoy.\\" Now how could O'Hara say Hemingway was the greatest writer since Shakespeare when O'Hara had never read Tolstoy?!!! Even ego-ridden Hemingway admitted Tolstoy was a greater writer than himself. And how can a literary writer dare sit down to write when he hasn't yet read the master, Tolstoy. O'Hara was okay, but not great. Yeah, no wonder that revival attempt in the mid-90's flopped.	2001-09-25

I was interested how he enabled a big company like GE to grow year after year, and his methods were worth reading. I have to say that the methods he used for the company to grow and stay flexible are methods I've read in a number of other management books. So I didn't really read anything NEW. But it was worth reading to see those methods tested and see them pass the test. Welch doesn't have much subtlety in his personality, nor does he seem to be introspective at all. That makes much of this book seem like a long sequence of big bland bromides. Not much RESONATES in this book. But men of action often are not deep thinkers. That's what makes them men of action. If you liked this book, I would also recommend Richard Branson's LOSING MY VIRGINITY and David Mahoney's CONFESSIONS OF A STREET-SMART MANAGER.	2001-09-24

But the author just uses the genome foundation to write often arbitrary essays on human beings. It's not really as advertised. And he's really opinionated at times. He makes the claim that lactose tolerant groupings of people WILLED their genes to become lactose tolerant. (I'd like to will my DNA to need no sleep...)That's a really outrageous claim. And in the final chapter, 22, on free will, he is so adamant that parents have NOTHING to do with how a child develops emotionally, that it is all PEER pressure and genes that shape a child...he sounds like a parent who has problem children and is desperate to point the finger at anyone but himself. He sites a study that showed STEP-children of abusers did not abuse their own children, showing that abusers got the tendency to abuse from their abusing parents only genetically. Okay. But what about the link between people suffering from multiple personality disorder invariably being the victims of child abuse? Is multiple personality disorder purely a genetic phenomenon? Mr. Ridley would argue it is. But the evidence is that multiple personality disorder is a result of abuse. I mean there is BROAD and solid documentation of parents shaping a child's emotional life. If parents didn't, then we should never feel sorry for orphans. But the author SINCERELY claims that children shape the emotional lives of their parents more than the other way around. The fact is the human childhood is so long, compared to other animals, BECAUSE the child needs shaping by his parents. And when that shaping goes awry...the parents can be to blame. Chapter 22 basically gives parents permission to be really really really lousy parents, and not to feel bad...because if the kids end up in rehab: hey, you had nothing to do with it! You can beat your kid daily, but if he grows up to have no self-esteem...it's not your fault! Isn't that great? Not to get too dramatic--well, I have already--but the final chapter was a little reckless! But, hey, the rest of the book has some fascinating stuff. However, as there is junk DNA in our genomes, there are junk paragraphs in this book.	2001-09-07

Cliches often are cliches, though, because they're true. If you've never read a business book before, then this will be an eye-opener. But he basically recites everything you've already learned in your Peter Drucker books. And if you haven't read Peter Drucker, then you should read him before you read this. The chapter on hiring people is very good. It doesn't really deal with &quot;speed&quot; as much as the title promises, although it does deal with it. A better book about fast companies is IT'S NOT THE BIG THAT EAT THE SMALL, IT'S THE FAST THAT EAT THE SLOW. I thought that was a much better book about quick growth. But this isn't a bad book at all, and has much to recommend it.	2001-08-30

So are a lot of other pieces here. The &quot;My Three Stooges&quot; piece is a bit much, though, where he knocks Mailer, Updike and Irving for criticizing A MAN IN FULL. For one thing, it WAS a very flawed novel. The other thing is he keeps getting in digs about how old the three men are, WHEN WOLFE IS IN THE SAME AGE RANGE AS MAILER AND UPDIKE. And Wolfe is a LOT older than John Irving! Irving is in his 50's, whereas Wolfe is in his 70's. So who is Wolfe to call John Irving old? I found that part of the essay, frankly, bizarre.	2001-08-28

But when he approaches certain scientific areas, he goes off the rails! He compares the old probablity example of &quot;could a million chimps at typewriters randomly type the great works of literature over a billion years? No,&quot; as an argument for why evolution could not randomly occur. Well, evolution did NOT randomly occur. Molecular structures can result from basic rules of inanimate matter that set the foundations for organic matter to evolve (such as carbon molecules). Ringer also makes the claim that &quot;there are no intermediary stages between species in the fossil record&quot; as further evidence that evolution may not have occurred. But there ARE intermediary stages in the fossil record. I'd point you to intelligent websites that shows this, but Amazon.com doesn't allow--understandably--other webite addresses in these reviews. Okay, the other bit of silliness of Ringer's is when he tells of a doctor who could find a cure for a disease with a special &quot;alternative medicine&quot; diet, and the American Medical Association barred him from promoting his discoveries because he was a &quot;threat&quot; to doctors. Well, this guy was obviously a quack, and the doctors were just ignoring his research because it had a flimsly scientific basis. The doctors weren't some conspiracy to bury this guy's useful findings, because he was a threat to them. How could he be a threat? They could have just adopted his discoveries and cured their patients with it, charging fees. He wasn't a &quot;threat&quot; to them. So, anyway, when Ringer steps into the realm of science, he is hardly &quot;rational&quot;, even though the whole point of this book is to promote rational thought. But the rest of the book, as I said, is a decent tome of common sense advice. When he gives advice on how to run a business, etc., he knows what he's talking about.	2001-08-26

And, frankly, it's refreshing to see a guy whose first business was instantly successful, and that he started in college. So many business books are by men who had many businesses fail, and had long apprenticeships before finally hitting it big after much struggle, and tell you you'll have to suffer the same to get to the top. Dell shows it's possible to be successful right out of the starting gate. And I saw Michael Dell interviewed on PBS recently, and it was refreshing that, still as CEO, his work hours are about 8-to-5, 5 days a week. My dad was a workaholic...but he never got rich. So it's nice to see you can own and run a multi-billion dollar company and have a balanced life, too. Michael Dell doesn't seem to display--(maybe I'm wrong)--the predatory, bullying behavior of a Bill Gates. Could it be that he's a nice guy that finished first? I hope so!	2001-08-01

I didn't get the impression he has as bloated an ego as others have suggested. I found it a readable, human relating of his life. He is pro-Clinton I think largely because he's had social contact with Clinton. Clinton phoned him up to say he was going to run for President. Surely Tobias' relishes that. I think Clinton is a scum-bag. So I part ways on Tobias about him. Tobias has his vanities. He's upset with ...bias. But he's obsessed that none of his lovers be more than 5 years older than he. But isn't that anti-age prejudice? He admits he's super-picky about who he considers for lovers. But isn't there prejudice there, against people with no social stature and ugliness? Or whatever his standards are? If you want to be treated equal, you've got to treat others equal. Or not. But it is good manners. Anyway, this is a decent work. I'd hoped for a bit more about his career. I ended up skimming a lot of the... trauma pages as a result. Although I admit I didn't realize before how being... can alter every moment of your life!

Not just for the story of murder and forgery in the modern day...but for the history of the Mormon church. Joseph Smith originally intended THE BOOK OF MORMON to be a novel, that he hoped would make him some money. When people mistook it for real scripture, he was shocked, then thought he could make even more money this way, starting a religion. After the religion got going, he had dissenters assassinated. I had no idea the Mormon Church was based on such a flimsy, corrupt, foundation. As flimsy and corrupt as Scientology. Give the Church of Scientolgy 150 more years, and it will be as respectable as Mormonism. It's as like if the readers of THE CELESTINE PROPHECY believed that was truth, and its author as a result started a religion. The truth of Joseph Smith is almost as riveting as the truth of Mike Hofmann, the forger and murderer in the modern day, who is the main focus of this book. Hofmann said he and Josepth Smith were very much alike. He may be more right than we'd like to think. Not just a page-turner, but an eye-opener.	2001-06-26

The writing is really school-boyish. Brando dictated his memories into a tape recorder, and APPARENTLY Robert Lindsey honed the prose into shape. But I can't see much honing that was done. Lindsey has written great nonfiction books like THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN and A GATHERING OF SAINTS. He's a first-rate writer...but he didn't seem to apply much of his expertise to the words in this book. Having said that, that as reticent and important an actor as Brando wrote his autobiography, is amazing, and worth savoring. Many of the anecdotes are amusing and interesting.

I have to say, I was wondering if some of it was made up when I read it. That he alone got Christopher Boyce to confess to robbing banks seemed a little too easy. Maybe he did. But, actually, I didn't even KNOW Christopher Boyce (the  Falcon &quot;spy&quot; in the movie FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN) had escaped prison and robbed banks, so was interested in that section of the book for that. But I thought Pascucci was spot on when he states that Boyce didn't sell secrets to the Soviets for idealogical reasons, as he claimed, but because Boyce is a purely immoral sociopath. The one problem I really had with the book is Pascucci states so blithely how he would sign his own search warrants, without ever getting a judge's approval, so he was making all these illegal searches, but figures the ends justifies the means. Uh, the laws were written for a reason. That he so cavalierly forged search warrants--and he does it throughout the book--appalled me.	2001-06-25

Capote is one of my favorite writers, so I thought I'd love this book. But I didn't. It played up Capote's frivolity and pettiness, and did not include enough of Capote's brilliance as a writer, nor his generosity. And the cutesy chapter summaries &quot;T.C. finds love, etc...&quot; are so silly and pointless, and don't come off at all. That tone trivializes a great American writer. Capote interviewed over 400 multiple murderers, to name one very unfrivolous thing he did in the course of his work. He wasn't all masked balls and dancing at Studio 54.

The NEW YORKER piece I hadn't, and enjoyed him giving them a proper skewering. The THREE STOOGES piece was a bit much, though. First off, A MAN IN FULL was a very very flawed novel. And the idea that criticism by his contemporaries was soley jealousy is self-serving. The other bizarre thing about that piece, is that Tom Wolfe goes on and on and on and on about how old Mailer, Updike and Irving are, NEVER MIND THAT TOM WOLFE IS IN THEIR SAME AGE GROUP.

And if you've never read his collected letters, then this will be all new to you. Good for the Hemingway-phile.	2001-05-22

Men I admire like Mario Puzo and producer David Brown counted him a great friend, so he must not be as bad as I think. I know someone connected with one part of this book, who said that it's garbage the bit she knows about. So It makes me wonder how much else in this book is fabricated. But on its own terms, it's not a bad Hollywood read. But I'm not surprised to see that it's out of print (in book form), either.	2001-05-22

But what is great about his one, to me, was that Allen analyses WHY we should do what he recommends. He has analysed how the human mind thinks, and what it will respond to. He sets forth a lot of &quot;simple&quot; things, that once they are pointed out to you you think, &quot;of course!&quot; but that you never figured out on your own.

That's the greatest description of most liberals I've ever read, &quot;liberal herd.&quot; And this coming from a liberal writer. I'm not crazy about George W.

Original in that it relates how the world is not fair, and that you should get on the side where the advantages are. (A lot of business books try and rationalize how poor people &quot;deserve&quot; their poverty. This book says, &quot;Be rich. It's better.&quot;) He sets forth the idea that we are leaving the industrial age, and entering the information age. If you don't believe him, read a book he recommends &quot;The Worldly Philosophers : The Lives, Times, and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers&quot; -- by Robert L. Heilbroner. At least the first part. It paints the economic stages of human history, and may make what Kiyosaki sets down here more comprehensible.	2001-05-16

He's ridiculously dramatic when relating his personal life, and his bleeding-heart-liberal moments are almost laughable in their (unintended) schmaltziness. And he is so opinionated about films, that, if you've seen the ones he's talking about, may scratch your head about the certaintly of his wrong-headed opinions. Despite those flaws, the book is very entertaining. And it inspired me to rent the movie he voted for the Cannes jury prize award (I won't say which one and give the surprise away), which, indeed, is a great film.	2001-05-16

Books	5	0	2	N	N	Good	This is a flawed book for sure, but it is so REFRESHING to see someone set down so HONESTLY the nature of making money, etc. Most rich guys writing about making money, rationalize wealth as something that is their due, something they deserve. &quot;The world is a perfectly balanced place&quot; kind of junk. Kiyosaki says the rich have advantages that they don't necessarily deserve. The laws were made by rich people, for rich people. So, if that's the reality, why not try and be one of the rich? It was great to read such forthright truths.	2001-05-16

But one thing I like about the screenplay version of TERMINATOR 2 is that it includes additional scenes, etc., that didn't make the final film. The orignal version of AMERICAN BEAUTY has the drug-dealer boy friend being framed for Spacey's murder, and also Spacey actually has sex with his daughter's friend. They changed those things for the movie, and I would have liked to have seen the alternate versions, even if as an appendix at the end. But nice to have the script nonetheless.	2001-05-13

But what has happened since his &quot;influence&quot;? THE NEW YORKER went from publishing often 2 stories an issue, to one story. ESQUIRE often doesn't publish any short fiction at all anymore. MADEMOISELLE stopped published short fiction ever. Maybe Carver actually killed the short story in American lit, because he bored everyone to death.

Most criticism of this book is hysterical, by people who desperately WANT for there to have been a conspiracy. I did read Patricia Lambert's book FALSE WITNESS, which is a fantastic companion book to this one--for one thing she actually interviews the boy who was molested by Jim Garrison, an incident Posner only refers to in passing in this book--and she has some fair criticism of CASE CLOSED. But even if her criticisms are accurate, they aren't enough to bury this book. Vincent Bugliosi said &quot;evidence is like a rope, not like a chain. If the link of a chain is broken, the whole chain breaks. If one of the strands of a rope is broken, the rope will still hold together.&quot; Even if a chunk of the evidence in this book were disproven, the other evidence is SO overwhelming, the conclusion would still be the same of Lee Harvey Oswald as a lone gunman. This is a brilliant book: a masterpiece of both objective analysis and history.	2001-05-09

And then they didn't quite make it. It's a slight book, of course. Each model has filled out a PLAYBOY Playmate type questionaire. But I loved it soley because the book includes among the male models ANDY WARHOL!!!!!!! Isn't that great????? Warhol became a fashion model in his last years becaue &quot;it was the thing to do.&quot; His manager was furious, since Warhol was being paid an hourly modeling rate to appear in ads, when he could have gotten a much bigger endorsement rate. But Andy was having fun. Anyone who remembers flipping through GQ and ESQUIRE in Andy's last years will remember seeing him in fashion ads. That Andy was included in this book shows the author/publisher had a sense of humor. Warhol himself once said a clerk in a shop looked like he recognized Warhol. And Warhol thought, &quot;Oh, he recognizes me as an artist.&quot; Then the clerk said, &quot;Weren't you the model in that Barney's ad?&quot; Warhol said that &quot;it made my day. It made my month. It made my year!&quot;	2001-05-03

He was a loser who lived with his mother, who was also the biggest of winners as the most successful American artist of the 20th Century. He was an icon of the sex and drugs and never-trust-anyone-over-30 era of the 60's...who never did drugs and never had sex, and became a star in his 30's. He was outrageous and shy. Rarely smiled, but had a great sense of humor. People put him down...but what contemporary artist today has REMOTELY the type recognition he had/has. Oh, Andy!!!	2001-05-03

Probably a psychopathic man (to read more about this breed, read WITHOUT CONSCIENCE by Robert Hare). Armand Hammer was so ego-ridden, he was always having some book published about how wonderful he was. So it's great to have a book to counter his propoganda about himself. People--especially Americans--love a success, and often willfully overlook the rotten ends the successful person went to to become successful. As was the case with Hammer. A vain vain, conscience-free man. This book was both nauseating and fascinating to read.	2001-05-01

It does have Hemingway's quirks. For one thing he misleads the reader into thinking that Fitzgerald never helped him edit THE SUN ALSO RISES. But that's Hemingway's ego not wanting to acknowledge a competitor. Fitzgerald DID in fact help Hemingway edit SUN, and on his advice, Hemingway cut a long section about Brett Ashley's background, that the book started with, and started it, instead, with the background on Robert Cohn. And Dunc Chaplin, the baseball player wasn't even in Paris when Hemingway says he was with Fitzgerald when they met. He also cuts people down, and to mitigate his bitchiness toward them, he goes overboard in his praise of Ezra Pound, as though to convince the reader that he wasn't all bitchiness. These aren't really criticisms of the book, they are actually part of it's catty charm. Hemingway's humor comes through, in probably the only book of his that shows humor other than THE SUN ALSO RISES. A great memoir. One of the best.	2001-04-30

The greatest film critic of all, Pauline Kael, said Stone was a lousy screenwriter, and she's right. And Oliver Stone's response at the end of the book to Gerald Posner's book on the JFK assassination CASE CLOSED (that proves convincingly that Oswald was a lone gunman) is just absurd!! Every sin Stone says Posner committed--and in fact did not commit in most cases--Stone committed a million times more in JFK! I've rarely seen greater hypocrisy than I saw in Stone's Posner piece.

Brando is a good storyteller, and tells some good stories in here. Grobel does preface the interview with phone call transcripts of him talking to Brando, and his secretary. And I know someone close to Brando, and some in the Brando camp felt some annoyance that Grobel taped the phone conversations without saying they were being taped. A bit presumptuous.

Morrison was a bigger student of poetry, but Paul's the better Poet. Granted, Paul has had more decades to his life to read and write poetry, which cetainly is relevant. But Paul's actually a decent poet. I just read a line of Paul's &quot;The critics don't like this poetry.&quot; I haven't read any of the criticism. But I think it's decent poetry. Yes, in a perfect world you'd be buying a volume of a starving young (or old) poet, instead of this one.

Teaching a psychopath to reform would be as futile as trying to teach a gold fish to tap dance. In that alone, I think this book is invaluable. It helps you identify psychopaths, and lets you know that the best thing is to just stay clear, if possible.	2001-04-25

He's built up an almost billion dollar business. I will say that in another book, he said he takes only 3 day vactions. That if he took a 2 week vacation &quot;I'd be so worried about my business at the end of the second week, it wouldn't be worth it.&quot; And he promotes working long hard hours. But I know more than one filthy rich self-made man, who are not retired but active in their businesses, who nonetheless do NOT work long hard hours year round, and take as much as a month off straight, while their businesses hum along nicely without them. I would say McCormack is failing in his methods of getting results if he can't at this point take long periods of time off, without worrying about his business. Richard Branson is active in his much larger Virgin empire, but he takes weeks off to go on those balloon expeditions of his. What is he doing right that McCormack isn't?<br />An example: In the book TIME TRAP (a time-management book I highly recommend) the author sites a salesman who made two goals for the next few years. The goals were to, each year, 1) double his income 2) double his vacation time. (!!) And the salesman succeeded, so that he doubled his income, as well as his vacation time, so that in the third year he had a lot more money, plus 6 weeks in vacation time. THAT'S what I call getting results!!!!<br />Harvey Mackay in one of his books sites a saleswoman he hired, who told him she worked 20 hours a week at her interview. Mackey told her, &quot;But your resume says you did $2 million in sales at your previous job.&quot; She said, &quot;I did. You can phone them and ask.&quot; Mackay did so, and they confirmed what she said. Mackay says to the reader, &quot;So I don't care HOW many hours a week she works, with those kind of results.&quot;<br />Maybe it's the nature of a service business (which is what McCormack's management company is): you can't let a factory stamp out widgets while you do somethingelse. You have to keep cracking the whip, or inspiring your subordinate agents, if they are what make-up your company. If that's the case, I'll avoid service businesses.	2001-04-23

I think such writing is the equivalent of ham acting. Henry James once criticized Tolstoy for writing too straight. But I can't stand Henry James, because of his jungle of verbiage. So if you love Henry James, you'll likely like Chabon. But his writing is definitely not for everyone. BUT, writers, especially literary writers, are famous for being bitter. Much has been written about the anger and bitterness of writers. So I would like to commend Chabon on the humanity and gentleness he brings to his characters. One of my mother's friends knew Arthur Miller, who always spouted leftist politics, and saving humanity. But she found that he actually treated people (humanity) like garbage one on one. Chabon seems to have a kindness that I doubt is reserved for just the page. There is too little tolerance and kindness in this world, so, even if I don't like the writing, the fact that such qualities come forth in this book make me not want to dismiss the collection entirely.	2001-04-19

O'Toole basically writes two parallel biographies, one of his childhood AND ONE OF ADOLPH HITLER'S adult life!!! Has this ever been done before? So you get to read about what O'Toole did and what Hitler was doing about the same time. It's amusing, and interesting. I did have trouble with some English slang. A weird book, I think. But I liked it. Peter O'Toole is my favorite actor. But I still think you'd enjoy it if you're not a big fan.	2001-04-15

It's written in a hip, quickspeak, that is too oblique to grab you. It's like reading Derek Taylor's memoir of his time with the Beatles, where he tries so hard to sound hip-literary, he completely buries what he's writing about. Oldham was intimate with the Stones. He's a witty guy in interviews. This is a fat book, but very little in it that's intereting. After I bought it, I read it once, skimming a lot of it, and donated it to the library. It does obliquely confirm that he and Jagger had a gay affair. In the bio JAGGER UNAUTHORIZED, that author makes the claim that Oldham and Jagger slept together. In Stoned, Oldham says, &quot;Me and Mick got as close as two men can possibly get,&quot; which to me confirmed the rumor. And Oldham set Keith up with his girl friend, as Oldham thought, &quot;Keith should go out with something other than his guitar.&quot; That's about all of interest about the Stones in this book. It's as disappointig as Peter O'Toole's memoirs.	2001-04-15

I was frankly appalled at so many people shrugging off O.J. Simpson getting away with murder, and shrugging off the rape allegations of Juanita Broaddrick against Bill Clinton. And Ringer addresses this problem (using, incidentally, Clinton and Simpson as illustrations) with going through life seeing immoral people get away with murder. There is much much more in this book, also things I'd been thinking about. If you take what he says to heart, you'll make your life, and those around you, better.	2001-04-13

It's an inspiring book, that gives you faith in human nature...all you have to do is appeal to peoples' best impulses to get them to perform well and enthusiastically (the MANAGERS had to rescue a union organizer from the WORKERS, who wanted nothing to do with unions. Imagine that! WORKERS being hostile to the union representative, and MANAGERS, rescuing him from a hostile group!) This may be the greatest business book ever written, frankly!!

You do have to take on faith a lot that their conclusions are the correct ones, but they seem to have put a lot of study into it, so it is almost certainly worthy information. If you've read a lot of management/business books, you'll see a lot here that you've read before. But you will also read new ideas. The authors are self-deprecating, admitting that they thought their studies would produce different results, and relating the results they DID find, that gives you confidence that they were not superimposing theories on what they observed, but observed things objectively. So I highly recommend this book, as it could literally be worth a billion dollars to you!	2001-02-09

The tone is not that dissimilar from other Grisham novels, and it is still a thriller (probably the best thriller I've read since Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE) involving a murder, which is very Grisham. And it takes place in the South. So I recommend it highly.	2001-02-06

Yes, Nixon should have been removed BUT HE SHOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE BEEN HEARD DURING AN IMPEACHMENT HEARING instead of being manipulated into resigning by Al Haig. But Al Haig was frightend about what would come out about HIM in an impeachment hearing, so manipulated Nixon into resigning. Despicable. Just this week that I write this,  a defamation suit regarding this book against G. Gordon Liddy was dismissed by the judge. So the truth of this book has been held up in a court of law. It's one of the most incredible books I've ever read.	2001-02-04

He is a liberal who in this book refers to &quot;those on the Left who saw the menace of Clinton, and who resisted the moral and political blackmail which silenced and shamed the liberal herd.&quot; WHICH SILENCED AND SHAMED THE LIBERAL HERD. That about sums up the bizarre defending of Clinton by the left, despite all the evidence of Clinton's corruption (much of which is spelled out in this book). Most liberals have a double standard (as Hitchens point out, originally Al Gore used Willie Horton against Dukakis in the 1992 primaries. No liberals blinked at that. But when Bush used Willie Horton against Dukakis...suddenly it was racism. What hypocrisy!!) A great book.	2001-02-01

I was impressed to find I'd been in some of the towns George visited in Illinois. His sister Louise really helps the author a lot, so it's &quot;from the horse's mouth&quot;. It is also quite well written. The fascinating thing about the book is it's George in the USA only 5 months before the Beatles were to explode in the USA. He even does some minor publicity for the group, and, believe it or not, Ringo was going to come with George until he learned Louise was preparing some publicity things for George. And Ringo just wanted a straight vacation. So George's brother Peter came to the USA instead of Ringo. A really fun book to read.	2001-01-31

But I would like to address the LSD bit in the book. In the book the Beatles, especially George, make LSD sound really attractive to take. So I would just like to quote from John Lennon's own primal scream therapist, Dr. Janov (as quoted in the Winter 2000 issue of MOJO): &quot;LSD is the most devastating thing for mental health that ever existed. To this day, we see people who've had LSD, and they have a different brain-wave pattern, as if their defenses are totally broken down. It stays. I think Timothy Leary destroyed so many people by touting LSD. It's a very, very dangerous drug.&quot; After reading the Beatles ANTHOLOGY I thought taking LSD might be a good idea. So I'm sure others have, too. So I wanted to put Janov's--John Lennon's own therapist--opinion about the drug to discourage any other impressionable readers out there.	2001-01-20

Edie was sort of vacuous, but nonetheless interesting in her recklessnes. Although she is surprisingly articulate in her oral passages. More than you would expect after reading about her. This frankly, I don't think, is an inherently interesting story, so Plimpton and Stein are to be commended for the way they put this oral history together. Hollywood has been talking ever since this book was published of making it into a movie, but it hasn't happened yet. I'd like to see it!	2001-01-10

He was a winner/loser, daring/timid, a man who was an icon in the drug-crazed 60's and 70's, who never did a nonprescription drug himself. A man who epitimized the 60's generation who hated their parents...but Warhol lived with his mother. Warhol was unique, and that's what make these diaries worth reading.	2001-01-10

Even if you're not interested in the craft of acting, but do have an interest in Shakespeare, I highly reccomend this book. And it is written without any pretension. Obviously the name &quot;Shakespeare&quot; in our culture can carry as much snob appeal as the name &quot;Gucci&quot; or &quot;Hermes&quot; and a fair amount of snobbery is often attached to Shakespeare because of it. But this book comes from a pure love of Shakespeare, so you don't feel you are reading something that is &quot;good for you.&quot; He is made enjoyable. As the authors point out, Shakespeare ran the Globe Theater for profit, so had to appeal to the masses to get them to buy tickets. And so he was likely not a snob, and should be (I think!) approached as these authors approach him. This book is an absolute treat.	2001-01-04

It could have been called &quot;career and business tips,&quot; which is basically what it is. McCormack's writing has gotten better since his earlier books, so I found this one good on that account. His tips have a bit more depth here, too. He mentions how his 2nd wife has helped him learn to &quot;stop and smell the roses,&quot; and perhaps that's why this book seems less &quot;combat&quot;-like than some of his past books. Plus, his arrogance, that would bleed between the lines in past books was, thankfully, missing. (For example, in earlier books he said, &quot;I made a lot of money at a young age, so I never resented others who did,&quot; not considering that perhaps some readers are young and broke, or old and broke, and might resent HIM. And also he said, &quot;99% of people should work for someone else,&quot; which conveniently puts him in the elite 1%, and, never mind that through most of history, until the industrial revolution, most people were self-employed.) Anyway, this book is readable and helpful, with some tips I don't think I would have seen anywhere else. He does reuse anecdotes that he uses in other books, but I didnt' mind. If you want a general career-tips book, this is as good as any recent ones I've read recently.	2001-01-01

McCormack is a lawyer-turned-businessman, who built a business from scratch that placed him on the FORBES 400. So if there's a businessman who knows legal matters enough to help the average businessman, he's it.

But it's easier to impersonate Brando (I can!) than act like him. And when Harris writes on his own, in the novel itself, it fails miserably. The character changes and plot are/is SOOOOO drawn out, the story could have been told in ten pages. Harris headed the UCI writer's program, whose reputation became so golden during his tenure, and when I read this book, I was shocked at how bad a novel written by a man who headed one of the most lauded writing programs in the country could be. Maybe that's why I think Michael Chabon's--a famous graduate of the program, and Harris' student--books are so bad. I saw Harris talk about SUITCASE at UCI, and he came across as extremely arrogant. But he wasn't talented enough to be as arrogant as he was...which is often the case, though. The second tier of status in any pecking-order will be snobbier than the top tier. He mentioned over and over how he got his first short story accepted to ESQUIRE at age 20. But Hemingway said that it's best if a writer doesn't publish for at least 5 years, otherwise he might level off craft-wise at the level he reached when he first got published, and not evolve past that. Maybe that was Harris' problem. He got published too young, and never felt the need to write better than he wrote at 20. I weak book in almost every way.	2000-12-22

I'd rate it higher, but for the whole legal disclaimer bit that says, &quot;this is a work of imagination&quot; etc., and is oblique in how the Lennon diaries were used. So you're uncertain whether what your reading is true or false. Obviously a lot of it is true, as Rosen admits to using other sources than the diaries. But, that aside, it is an interesting and well-written book. And one extreme but perhaps fair point is John Lennon's demons, and self-proclaimed--in his PLAYBOY interview--violent impulses. John Lennon in this book is madly jealous of Paul Simon and Paul McCartney for being bigger solo successes than he is. He is happy when McCartney gets thrown in jail in Japan. And the end bit gives an oblique comparison to John's killer...that if Brian Epstein had not come into the Cavern Club and discovered the Beatles, and Lennon had stayed a nobody, Lennon might have reacted with the envy his killer had toward him, toward someone else who became a big star. John's killer was jealous of Lennon...Lennon was jealous of Simon and McCartney...and what if Lennon had gone absolutely nowhere, and stayed in Liverpool? As he said in Hunter Davies' biography, &quot;If not for the Beatles, I might have ended up like my father,&quot; a failed bum. Just like Lennon's killer. That's an extreme comparison. But As McCartney said in the expanded Davies' book, &quot;Ever since John died, he's become Martin Luther Lennon.&quot; This book shows the anger and jealousy and pettines of Lennon...which makes him less than saint-like...but nonetheless human, and somewhat endearing because of it. A good book to be read with a pinch of salt.	2000-12-13

But they bite. McCartney does not have artistic talent. A celebrity painting makes one groan anyway. But I had to admit after viewing Anthony Quinn's paintings and Tony Bennett's paintings, that they were actually quite good. (Even Tony Curtis's paintings aren't bad, in a hotel-room-art kind of way.) McCartney doesn't have it. And the interview with McCartney in front of the book is pretty bland. So the book isn't even worth getting for that. Of all the talented artists alive now who will die unknown, and here's an untalented artist getting national exposure. Oh, well, that's art and commerce in the age of celebrity. McCartney is a talented MUSICAL artist, of course, and should not have strayed from that.	2000-12-12

Hare's book indirectly explains Clinton's personality well, and also the personalities of those who let people like him get away with their corruption, and excuse him, and &quot;shoot the messengers.&quot; This is a very important book, because none of us will escape psychopaths in our lives, whether it's being victims of someone in your family, or someone in the White House, or the CEO of a company you own stock in.	2000-11-24

My favorite observation of Wolfe's, though, is that for poetry to be acceptable in literary circles these days, it has to be obscure, oblique, and hard to understand. Poets are upset these days that they aren't famous like Robert Frost was. Well, that's why. Wolfe is refreshing, to say the least.	2000-11-16

With all the Clinton scandals that have gone on, and Clinton stayed in the White House, reading this book makes Nixon's transgressions seem positively quaint by comparison. This book had its effect in its day, but with the more recent publication of SILENT COUP that reveals that Alexander Haig was Deep Throat, and Woodward's disingenousness about the whole affair, and that John Dean was actually behind the break-in to get an address book of prostitutes' names that had his wife's name in it from the DNC, this book is like reading a pre-Columbus book about the earth being flat. It's out of date. Read it to see what affected the country, but not for its now unfactual facts. If you want to know about Watergate, read SILENT COUP: THE REMOVAL OF A PRESIDENT.	2000-11-12

Well, this book is just a bunch of events that coalesce vaguely into a narrative arc...and it's a masterpiece.

This book and THE TIPPING POINT seem to present firm evidence that humans have become &quot;civilized&quot; away from the environment we are emotionally wired for. We are emotionally wired to deal with small groups (THE TIPPING POINT stresses 150 as the maximum number a group should be), and to have no one have a lot more materially than the rest of us. Envy, violence, etc., did not/do not exist in small hunter/gatherer groups. We are economically and population-wise at the point of no return. It's a shame. But there was a time when humans were not violent, etc., in human history. Before &quot;civilization.&quot; Machiavelli in THE PRINCE says that, &quot;War is the normal state, peace the abnormal state.&quot; It's the normal state in an abnormal world. It's a shame we can't return to the world we were wired for. The only thing I'm truely grateful for in modern-society is anesthesia. I'd hate to live without that. But every thing else I could do without, if it also meant doing without genocide and murder and rape etc. A brilliant--I would say necessary--book.	2000-11-03

Some of them have been updated, and I enjoyed reading the updates (the piece on Robert Noyce and Intel has been updated since its 1983 publication in &quot;Esquire&quot;). Some had been published before that I had NOT read. I'd been dying to read the piece on the &quot;New Yorker&quot; after reading ABOUT it. And I really loved it!! The &quot;New Yorker&quot; is so revered, it's delightful to see Wolfe give it some well-deserved and high-spirited criticism. And then some pieces are published here for the first time (I loved the &quot;Rococo Marxism&quot; piece.) &quot;My Three Stooges&quot; does smack a bit of &quot;me thinketh thou doth protest too much&quot;, because Updike, Mailer and Irving had a point. (A MAN IN FULL was a flawed novel). But they are more deserving of Wolfe's criticsim than he is of theirs. I didn't need to read &quot;Ambush at For Bragg&quot; again, having read it in &quot;Rolling Stone.&quot; But the &quot;re-runs&quot; were worth having, if it meant having the new and unread stuff. Wolfe is one of the greatest things we've got going in the writing world, and proof of that fact are in these pages.	2000-10-31

There is advice from famous people, too, like Gene Autry and Lawrence of Arabia. Some reviews here have stated how &quot;old&quot; some of this advice is, since the book was published a long time ago. But if you study Buddhism and such things, you'll see that most of this advice is actually thousands of years old! (Carnegie himself quotes Jesus advice to &quot;Have no thought for tomorrow&quot; as in don't worry about the future so much...so that is thousands of years old, too.) This is a very readable book, and helpful, and has advice helpful for even those who don't worry that much.	2000-10-28

He only really enjoys his free time. That's refreshing honesty. He points out how he made a lot of money in projects that took little effort.

I once read F. Scott Fitzgerald in a letter giving advice to a young writer, &quot;It probably isn't a good idea to expand your vocabulary past a certain point. Because then you'll be tempted to use all those long words, and they will weigh your writing down.&quot; I was astounded to read a legendary writer like Fitzgerald giving another writer advice to NOT acquire as big a vocabulary as possible. But this book--to me--shows how absolutely correct Fitzgerald was. Chabon himself once said, &quot;I have a big vocabulary, and I like to use it.&quot; This book could have used a judicious editor.

At the trial, a witness who was not in the book, testified that she saw Swango inject poison in a patient, and that he then literally stayed in the room for 2 hours to watch the patient die, even though he had responsibilities elsewhere in the hospital. It seemed this was the most damning testimony that Swango couldn't maneuver around, so, to avoid a death sentence, Swango pled guilty in exchange for life-imprisonment. The judge then said that when serving his life term, Swango should never be in charge of prison food. (Smart judge!)	2000-10-02

O'Hara famously called Hemingway the greatest writer since Shakespeare. But O'Hara once said he never read Tolstoy. How can you call a writer the greatest since Shakespeare when you've never read Tolstoy? O'Hara mainly read Fitzgerald and Hemingway over and over, and I think his work suffers for his not have read more broadly. &quot;Appointment in Samara&quot; is very good at contrasting status--something O'Hara was obsessed with--in an American town.  But I find O'Hara's dialogue--that he gets so much praise for--dated. Whereas Hemingway's dialogue in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;--written BEFORE &quot;Samarra&quot;--does not look dated at all now. O'Hara famously wrote his fiction quickly. It has that feel to it in spots. In the 90's there was an attempt at an O'Hara revival. Well, that revival fell flat. I can see why it did fall flat. He wasn't that terrific a writer. But, this book is pretty good. (I don't understand the last passage of this book, that conversation. Who are those people talking, and what's the point of it?)	2000-10-01

It is a little biased, but, frankly, John and Yoko always went on, as George put it, &quot;that we were idiots and only he and the wife had a clue.&quot; McCartney points out how Yoko had a big retrospective show, but since there wasn't enough work for a retropsective, she had to quick make some!  (Some career!) And that the other three Beatles were billed for furthering Yoko's ambitions, like this gallery show. Perhaps the three Beatles could have been more receptive to Yoko, but John and Yoko could have been better-mannered themselves, and this book points that out. Also, it was refreshing for Paul to admit that he likes fame. Rather than the b.s. boo hooing that fame is all a burdern. He relates in here how he went in disguise by himself through France for 2 weeks, and got sick of it toward the end, and remembered why he wanted to be famous, so appeared in public as himself again, and was glad to be recognized. A good book.	2000-09-30

It took Stanley Booth more than ten years to write this. I think that if he'd gotten the text down sooner, the feel would have been more urgent. Some of the feel and memories I think dried up by the time he finished it. But a decent read for any Stones fan. And I liked how Mick was embarrassed when someone called him on his stinky feet, and how he acted shy singing in front of Stanely Booth. He can sing in front of tens of thousands, but to sing in front of one person he knows gives him stage fright. Ahhh, Mick, I luv ya yer vulnerabilities!	2000-09-27

If you love florid writing, this is your dream. There is no one more florid than Michael Chabon. Jonathan Braine in his book on novel writing, said that in his highly regarded novels he tried never to use an adjective. Chabon LOVES those adjectives. Hemingway in &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; relates advice given him (I think by Ezra Pound) to use adjectives very sparingly. There is Hemingway heeding advice that Chabon fails to. Oh, and Chabon loves cliches, too. But he's no Theodore Dreiser whose over-all impact transcends the clumsiness of some of the word-for-word writing. I want to like Chabon. I really do. I think he portrays characters with kindness and sensitivity, when so many writers--like Tom Wolfe--traffic mainly in brutal and/or shallow portraits of people. I mean, I imagine Chabon makes for a great friend! But the way he delivers those characters makes me grind my teeth. The &quot;NY Times&quot; raved about this, so Chabon will shortly become THE literary dude of the moment. And, again, if florid writing, and purple prose, and adjectives and cliches are your thing, by all means click that shopping cart!!	2000-09-27

It was originally published as a limited edition leather-bound book that Harrison autographed each copy of (like his LIVE IN JAPAN book, that costs about $500 and each of which he autographed, and BLINDS &amp; SHUTTERS, that the Stones and the Beatles wrote notes for, and were autographed by some, and are available here at amazon.com.

But the examples are anecdotal,  and they could have been chosen to further the authors' point. Were the  companies chosen to further the 22 laws, or the other way around? If the  laws are immutable, as they claim, then this is a first-rate book.<br />A lot  of what they claim has been expressed in other books I've read, including  Peter Drucker: such as, keep your product line down to a few items,  managers should be in the trenches, not their executive dining room,  etc.<br />So, I haven't tested what this book advises, so can't say &quot;It's  great&quot;, but if these laws are immutable, then this slim tome could  literally be worth billions of dollars to you.	2000-09-19

Pete's is still swept back in the greaser style. It shows he was  not in sync with the others. (One other book by a Beatles photographer  relates that John told the photographer, &quot;The reason we got rid of  Pete was that his mother was too pushy.&quot; That's the only place I heard  THAT explanation).<br />For Pete to say he was a better drummer than Ringo is  delusional. I mean, could the Beatles have been BETTER than they were? Pop  music is not about who can play technically better, but how personalities  mesh, and Ringo's certainly meshed better with George, Paul and John than  Pete's did.<br />BUT, one thing this book shows is what garbage the complaints  were--especially by George and John--that fame and fortune are curses.  Yeah, they met violence as a result of fame, but they complained about fame  and fortune before the violence. <br />The most telling point is when Pete  Best tries to kill himself by turning on the gas in his place. His mom  comes in just in time and saves him. She said, &quot;You can't let the  Beatles success lead you to suicide.&quot;<br />Did any of the Beatles--those  with the fame and fortune--ever try to kill themselves?? No, it was the one  WITHOUT the fame and fortune who tried to kill himself. That's the main  point I liked that this book made. It puts the lie to that constant  complaint you hear from stars, &quot;Oh, fame and fortune is a curse.&quot;  Yeah, right.	2000-09-04

Hitchens doesn't overlook ( as so many liberals  do) in this that Clinton was going to 1) smear Monica Lewinsky  slanderously, until the stained dress came to light 2) Bombed that Somalia  factory as a distraction from the Lewinsky affair, when there was no  evidence that there was any chemical warfare production going on there (Ken  Starr spend $30 million? How much money was spent bombing that  pharmaceutical company?) And there's a lot more in this book, too. Anyone  who thinks Clinton's reputation will be a good one in the long run, should  consider that President Warren Harding's supporters accused his detractors  of being a &quot;conspiracy.&quot; Historians NOW unanimously agree that in  fact there was no conspiracy against Harding. That, in fact, the Harding  adminstration was a corrupt one. That will ultimately be Clinton's legacy,  too. Hitchens just has a brain enough to realized it NOW. I hope Hitchens  writes a lot more books!	2000-08-27

Capote was famously charming in life, and his charm translates to the page, for this  is one of the most charming books I've ever read. While I did not like the  recent movie version of this book, I would like to relate that the director  chose to direct it after he asked a movie-friend, &quot;What is the  greatest novel you've ever read that has never been made into a  movie?&quot; The movie-friend said, &quot;THE GRASS HARP.&quot; That  movie-friend had taste in books. There are rumors that Harper Lee never  wrote a second book after TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, because Truman Capote more  or less wrote TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD for her! And without Capote by her  side, she couldn't really &quot;write&quot; another book. A GRASS HARP has  the same kind of charm that MOCKINGBIRD did, so that story is almost  believable. (Capote was a close friend of Harper Lee's since childhood, and  was the prototype for the character Dew in MOCKINGBIRD.) THE GRASS HARP is  a famous book, but not as famous as it should be.	2000-08-24

The writing is too  self-conscious. The symbolism is heavy-handed (the broken sun-glasses  representing the protagonist's view of life being altered. Contrived!)

Well, now it's here, and it was worth the wait. Ryan has a lot  to deal with, and there are enough subplots and characters to fill a  Russian novel. You may have trouble keeping track of the characters and  subplots, but it's worth the effort. This is the best thriller novel since  Craig Furnas' THE SHAPE, and I hope Harrison Ford will be still young  enough to play Ryan when they make THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON into a movie. (I  can't help but think Clancy waited for the presidential campaigns in real  life to start up to publish this book, to give an indirect boost to the  Republicans. But that's speculation. I don't mind if he did, though.) A  rivetting read.	2000-08-24

I sympathize with the author complaining to the teacher,  &quot;But it's taking so long!&quot; It took years for him to become a Zen  master in archery. I think a good, if oblique, companion piece to this book  is THE USER ILLUSION, that explains how the mind works in a  conciousness-vs.-unconsciousness way. We have tens of thousand of bytes of  information entering our brains every second, but our consciousness only  registers up to only 30 bytes! That's a lot of information being absorbed  by our subconscious! What the Zen discipline does is try to open up the  mind to working with all those subconscious bytes. The week I write this  (Aug. 23, 2000) the &quot;New Yorker&quot; has a good article by Malcolm  Gladwell about when pro athletes choke. Basically their conscious minds  take over too much. I'd read that article, too. Anyway, this book is very  readable, very accessible, and makes me feel like a spiritual wienie since  I'm so far beneath such mastery of my own mind!	2000-08-23

Lawrence	Books	5	10	17	N	N	good	I found this extremely readable, and written clearly (a relief after trying to plow through T.E. Lawrence's own murky 7 PILLARS OF WISDOM, a  book he himself did not like after he learned that good writing is clear  writing). I wouldn't have, and a lot of you reading this, wouldn't have  come to this book without the movie, so I would like to mention some things  that the movie was wrong about, according to this book. 1) T. E. Lawrence  did have to execute an Arab with his pistol, but he DID feel remorse about  it and did NOT experience a perverse pleasure at it. 2) He was not  homosexual. He in fact asked a girl to marry him, who turned him down. It  was standard in that era that an educated Englishman still be a virgin in  his mid-20's, and the only reason he stayed a virgin until his death in his  40's was that he was raped by those Turks (as is obliquely referred to in  the movie), and as a consequence was (tragically) repulsed by physical  human contact thereafter. So he became, as he himself described it, &quot;A  lay monk.&quot; A first-rate book for anyone interested in the heroic  Laurence. (I say heroic because after taking Aquaba, he was up for a  Victoria's Cross, England's highest military honor. But he needed an  English witness to the event, when only Arabs witnessed it. So he did not  get a Victoria's Cross, AND LAWRENCE DIDN'T CARE. He perhaps, then, wasn't  as vain as the movie portrayed him to be, either.)	2000-08-23

Goldman is too dramatic and weepy. His  modesty is so ridiculously schmaltzy, as to be laughable! And his trying to  pass off his success as a novelist at such a young age as somehow  unforunate is an insult to anyone with talent who never got a lucky break.  And, I'm sorry, while I think he has written wonderful screenplays, the ONE  totally original produced screenplay he wrote (THE YEAR OF THE COMET) stank  (despite what he argues about it in this book!). His good movies were  either from historical ideas (BUTCH CASSIDY, A BRIDGE TOO FAR, GHOST IN THE  DARKNESS), or adaptations of others peoples ideas (WALDO PEPPER was the  director's idea) other peoples' books (HARPER, ABSOLUTE POWER) TV shows  (MAVERICK), or his own books. That perhaps is not a fair criticism.  &quot;Marathon Man&quot; was his original novel, from which he adapted a  screenplay. And it's a great flick. But I do think he should have written  at least one good original screenplay, that STARTED as a screenplay, to be  preaching so bluntly to other writers. (And the original screenplay he  includes in the book is terrible!) But, he obviously has talent as a  writer. So he is definitely worth listening to. I read ALL THE PRESIDENTS  MEN, and that Goldman was able to carve out a brilliant screenplay from  that busy book, is to be commended. Regarding Goldman's reference to  critics and the British in this book, I would highly recommend Goldman's  book THE SEASON (that is a brilliant book). He expands on his take on both  critics and the British in the chapters &quot;The Approvers&quot; and  &quot;Snob Hit.&quot; And as far as his thinking directors are overpraised,  here are two quotes from good directors backing him up: Billy Bob Thorton  said, &quot;The writer creates the whole story. The actors bring the  characters to life. The cinematographer shoots it. The composer does the  score. A middle-manager comes in to organize these people, and suddenly  it's a Joel Schumaker film.&quot; Middle-manager! I love it! David Lean  said, &quot;I never thought of myself as an artist. I always thought I was  just the fellow who ORGANIZED the artists.&quot; This book is definitely a  mixed bag, but I do recommend it.	2000-08-23

But rock doesn't require &quot;literary&quot;  writing. And I don't agree with the Stones-in-decline take that he asserts  through much (with the exception of a live show) of his Stones piece.  (Blasphemous as it may sound, I think the 1960's were the Stones WORST  period, with the immense exception of &quot;Beggar's Banquet&quot;.) I  think he called Sid Vicious correctly. Johnny Rotten to this day can not  admit he was wrong in kicking Glen Matlcock out of the Sex Pistols. But  Kent's piece portrays Vicious as the pathetic, talentless bully he was. And  I think Kent's piece on Kurt Cobain is the best I've read. Cobain was a  hypocrite. A massive hypocrite. (Okay, so I also think Nirvana was the most  over-rated band of all time. Give me the Foo Fighters any day). I was so  pleased to read Kent's piece on Cobain...the truth of the man was finally  being told.	2000-08-22

It's one of those pulp books that get churned out quickly, in  case the pop sensation it's about fades before the book hits the shelves.  But if you know nothing about this band, this a decent place to start. I  went to the same high school (Corona del Mar High School) as Mark McGrath  and Stan, so, aside from loving their music, I have a sentimental feeling  for the band. (I graduated just before their freshman year, so missed them  by a year, so never got to pass them in the school halls). It's funny to  read, though, that Rodney played Shaka in &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; for  5 episodes because I knew in high school the guy who replaced him as Shaka:  Philip Paley! Which means, too, I'm afraid, that Rodney is older than he  lets on! I don't care. I love Sugar Ray!	2000-08-21

Then the next year (since the  Stones made it so fast) he was playing in those same clubs, and those same  women who treated him like garbage were now laying themselves at his feet.  He said it messed with his head to find out how truly shallow women can be.  So if you can get past the basic premise of this book, that women can be  disgustingly shallow and love a famous man whom they would detest if he  weren't famous, then it's readable and entertaining. The author made it  with Jim Morrison and Mick Jagger, and I'm a Stones and a Doors fan, so was  interested in those two stories. And I'm a Beatles fan, and she talks to  George Harrison, so that was fun. I have to say, the author shows you don't  have to be beautiful to nail the biggest stars. Pamela Des Barres is okay  looking, but I ain't no rock star, and I've rejected girls that had her  level of looks. So she must have charm to have attracted these stars. (Of  course you don't have to be beautiful to get a rock star, if you look at  Yoko Ono and Linda McCartney.) Anyway, Mick Jagger (according to the book  JAGGER UNAUTHORIZED) says about women over and over, &quot;All women are  groupies. All women are groupies.&quot; The Stones have been knocked for  writing songs that are disdainful of women. Maybe they have reason to be.  But if you're into classic rock, this is a book for you.	2000-08-20

But Douglas writes over and over about how these men went violent because their dreams were not happening.  Their careers were not flourishing, etc. Now, I'm probably the only person  when I was in school who did not have a midlife crisis at age 16 because he  realized he was not going to be a pro athlete. When I asked fellow-student  after fellow-student what they were going to do when they finished with  high-school and college, I'd hear, &quot;I'm going into sports  medicine&quot; or &quot;I'm going to be a sports broadcaster.&quot; After  hearing that from the millionth student, it dawned on me that none of these  students wanted to do those things. They actually wanted to be  pro-athletes. But, already, at high-school age, they knew  Michael-Jordan-type glory was not going to be their lot. So they were  aiming for a career AROUND sports. These fellow-students of mine's dreams  were already being shattered at age 16. But none of them picked up a gun,  and went shooting victims from a tower! John Wilkes Boothe shot Lincoln  because he was not as successful an actor as his brother. But there was  something MORE that was wrong with him. Perhaps he was a psychopath. I  think that is a great weakness with this book: that John Douglas gives  &quot;normal&quot; reasons for an abnormal mind violently flipping out. I  don't know anyone who isn't insecure, or hasn't had some disappointments.  But they don't go shooting up a McDonald's. Douglas should have written  MORE about WHY these people act violently in the face of what are actually  very common-type frustrations, and less about the frustrations themselves.  I find that a MAJOR flaw with this book. But other than that major gripe, I  think it's an interesting and educational read.	2000-08-19

But I'm appalled at how many pages he gives to the basic idea of mentally joining opposites, so one sees  the world more holistically. A decent point. But he says, &quot;You should  not see things as feminine or masculine,&quot; and expands on that. And he  lists all these opposites, one by one, page after page, that you should see  as one. He could basically have said in two pages &quot;See the world as  yin and yang&quot; like the Taoist symbol, and not belabored it so  extensively. The rest of the book has good points. But it is basically  watered-down Abraham Maslow, from his book, TOWARD A PSYCHOLOGY OF BEING.  Maslow says it better in that book.	2000-08-17

But she almost seems to believe she did nothing wrong. I mean, a girl who's slept with older married men would  be labeled not innocent...but she seems innocent in the way that she's too  stupid or self-absorbed to realize that maybe, just maybe, she's done  something wrong. Maybe she read Helen Gurly Brown's SEX AND THE SINGLE GIRL  too many times. And a lot of criticisms can be leveled at Linda Tripp. But  read Christopher Hitchens' book NO ONE LEFT TO LIE TO.  He was approached  by a Clinton subordinate, and was told about this girl Monica Lewinsky, who  was fantasizing about Clinton, and was stalking Clinton. Clinton was  starting a smear campaign against Monica Lewinsky, making her out to be a  delusional nut case. But then word of the stained blue dress came out. And  Clinton was stuck, because there was direct DNA evidence that Lewinsky  wasn't lying. So the smear campaign was stopped before it was really  started. BUT LINDA TRIPP TOLD MONICA TO SAVE THE BLUE DRESS!  What if  Monica hadn't? Where would she be now? smeared as a liar and a nut. So  Linda Tripp saved her butt, boys and girls. Yes, she taped their  conversations. But it's not all black and white.

Good God, does he love his  own opinions! He reminds me of Geraldo Rivera here: they both talk about  all the women they used to sleep with, pretending to be ashamed and  repentant, when the subtext the whole time screams, &quot;Ain't I a  stud!&quot; They are pretending to be &quot;confessing,&quot; when all  they're doing is bragging. He takes Clinton to task, but he also accuses  Americans of being too puritannical. (The French think we are too  puritannical about Clinton. But then the French said, &quot;In France,  Watergate would have been forgotten in three days.&quot;) And read NO ONE  LEFT TO LIE TO by Christopher Hitchens. You'll see that Linda Tripp saved  Monica Lewinsky by taping her and urging her to save the blue dress. The  Clinton White House was just starting on a smear campaign accusing Lewinsky  of fantasizing it all, and stalking Clinton...when that blue dress  appeared, that made the campaign stop before it started. It's absolute  sacrilege to say so, But Linda Tripp saved Lewinsky's butt. Not the opinion  in this book. Eszterhas reminds me of Norman Mailer. He's a dirty old man  who pretends to be preoccupied with sex for intellectual reasons...when in  fact he's just a lech. Read Harry Stein's HOW I ACCIDENTALLY JOINED THE  RIGHT WING CONSPIRACY AND FOUND INNER PEACE before you read this one. It  gives the best take on Clinton I've read yet.	2000-08-16

I only read the stuff I was  interested in, but there was plenty of that (especially the George  Harrison, Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger profiles).

If his key-board playing was as awkward as his writing, the  Doors never would have made it. There are bits of info of interest to Doors  fans. But I got sick of Ray knocking John Densmore. (I personally liked him  knocking Oliver Stone. Stone committed serious libel with the movie JFK,  and I think in a just world, should be rotting in jail now for it, or have  had to have made a big settlement.) I saw Ray last year give an intimate  performance at Muldoon's Irish Pub in Newport Beach. He played Doors riffs  on the piano. Told stories about Jim and the Doors. And it wasn't much  publicized, so he performed to a small crowd. It was a real treat. And he  did knock Oliver Stone when he talked. But he praised John Densmore. His  book was just out, and I wonder if he'd gotten flack for being mean to  Densmore in the book, and was making amends. I was cringing when he  mentioned Densmore, because I thought, &quot;Here come the insults.&quot;  But he was actually nice about Densmore when he spoke.

S. Grant once said, &quot;the best man for the  job doesn't go after the job, he waits to be called.&quot; This book  affirms what I've long thought, that people like Bill Clinton and Richard  Nixon, who were desperate to be president, so that they lied and cheated,  etc., to get that power, are the LAST people who SHOULD be President (or  CEO or whatever). Those who WANT the power are psychologically sick in some  way. And Clinton and Nixon should have both gone to prison. They both broke  the law. Psychopaths LOVE having power, and both Nixon and Clinton  displayed strong psychopathic characteristics. This book gives one some  faith in human nature because it shows that the best way to motivate humans  is to NURTURE them and give them FREEDOM. That if allowed, they will be  GOOD and PRODUCTIVE. There is a worthwhile insight on almost every page of  this book. And Maslow had an IQ of 195. So he was no idiot.	2000-08-12

It's so refreshing to find someone who sees the  reality of Clinton. Someone who doesn't shrug off criminal behavior because  &quot;the economy is doing well, and he's a Democrat.&quot;  (Hey, under  Mussollini, the trains ran on time. Does that mean he was a great leader,  too??) Imagine Hitchens finding Clinton despicable because he raped Juanita  Broaddrick? How can liberal supporters overlook that Clinton is a rapist,  or so distort Broaddrick's story in their minds that they convince  themselves that it can't at all be true (despite corroborating witnesses at  the time of the rape). How can they overlook that Clinton had a Sudanese  pharmaceutical company that had NO chemical warfare manufacturing going  on--as evidence has since proved, as is shown in this book--just to  distract people from the Monica Lewinsky scandle? People are upset at how  much Ken Starr spent? How about how much bombing a Sudanese factory costs  of your tax money! THANK GOD Christopher Hitchens doesn't overlook these  things!! (I would suggest Clinton supporters read the book WITHOUT  CONSCIENCE By a Dr. Hare about psychopaths, and how a common occurrence is  people SUPPORTING them even after their criminal actions have been pointed  out. And Clinton displays overt qualities of a psychopath.) And to those  reviewers below who think Clinton's reputation will be a good one in the  long run: Remember President Warren Harding? At the time of his corrupt  adminstration--with its Teapot Dome scandle and all--HIS SUPPORTERS ACCUSED  HIS ACCUSERS OF BEING A CONSPIRACY! Just like Clinton supporters today.

People mention Capote's  IN COLD BLOOD in previous reviews, and Wambaugh used that book as a model  for this one, and even used Capote's release forms to get interviews.  Wambaugh could not get the surviving cop to tell the story so that Wambaugh  could write the book. When Wambaugh told him about this book idea, and how  it wasn't going to happen, Capote encouraged him to keep at it. So, with  Capote's encouragement, Wambaugh finally got the surviving cop to  cooperate, and the book got written. The whole subtext of the book is what  I find fascinating, and that is: the surviving cop, who could not help his  partner being killed, felt guilt that destroyed him emotionally. But the  actual murderer and his partner felt no guilt whatsoever. Psychopaths can  not feel guilt, even after they've murdered. The innocent man felt guilty,  and the guilty men felt innocent. It's an incredible and wrenching and  tragic contrast that underlies this whole book. I recommend it.	2000-08-07

To the reviewer below that accuses Tobias of bragging about his &quot;vast fortune,&quot;:  the title of the book is meant IRONICALLY. It's like calling a bald guy  &quot;curly.&quot; Tobias obviously has money, but as he put it in his  column recently, he's a &quot;minor millionaire&quot; which in the new  world of billionaires might make a millionaire think he doesn't have much  to brag about. And I don't see that Tobias brags at all: what makes his  writing so funny, is he is a master of self-deprecating humor. He puts  himself down a lot in endearing and funny ways. So those who think he's  arrogant, etc.,  here, must have minds that aren't very good at  comprehending subtleties in life. This is mainly a collection of previously  published articles, which results in some dry patches, depending on your  interests, but I think you'll find a lot of it worth your time.  And, hey,  I'm a heterosexual who always votes Republican and I STILL love Tobias'  writing (a gay man who is treasurer for the Democratic National Committee,  or whatever the heck that organization is called.)	2000-08-07

I would like to mention, though, that the &quot;feelings of unreality&quot;  chapter is a little misleading, in that it suggests that the feelings will  fade faster than they actually might. Weekes suggests feelings of unreality  (also known as depersonalization neurosis) will fade in a few months if one  remains active, despite the symptoms. (Remaining active despite the  symptoms is the key.) It tends to take longer than a few months, and the  symptoms tend not to fade, but lift in &quot;layers.&quot;  The symptoms  will fade only very little, but then there will be a dramatic thinning of  the symptoms all at once! It often takes a number of layers to lift before  you are back to feeling normal. So don't get discouraged if you haven't  seen progress despite being active. Because tomorrow may be the day when a  layer lifts! Anyway, this book is very helpful for people. I would like to  mention that the comedian/actor Steve Martin (as he's related in a 1980  &quot;Playboy&quot; interview and elsewhere) suffered from panic attacks  for years when he was a writer for the &quot;Smothers Brothers Show.&quot;  He wouldn't go to movie theaters for years out of fear that he would suffer  a panic attack in the theater. But then he read up on panic disorders, and  was able to cure himself of them. He was cured of them so totally, that he  was then able to go on and become a top comedian and then a movie star. If  Steve Martin can cure himself of a crippling anxiety disorder, then so can  you! And this book should help.	2000-08-07

It's the  system's fault, Man! Blah, blah, blah. This book probably never would have  seen print if introduction-writer Norman Mailer hadn't supported it. Norman  Mailer famously stabbed his own wife badly enough to hospitalize her (but  she didn't press charges). I wonder if Mailer's excusing Abbott's behavior  was an indirect way of excusing his own behavior? So Abbot stabbed a waiter  and ended up back in prison. As an example of his lack of a conscience,  consider what he said on &quot;Current Affair&quot; when asked if he felt  remorse: &quot;I don't think that's the proper word. Remorse implies that I  did something wrong. IF I'm the one who stabbed him, it was an  accident.&quot; He &quot;justified&quot; murdering the waiter/actor by  saying &quot;He had no future as an actor--chances are he would have gone  into another line of work.&quot; Abbot had told the victim's wife in court  that her husband's life was &quot;not worth a dime.&quot; If you do read  this book and somehow find yourself sympathizing with Abbot, I implore you  to read WITHOUT CONSCIENCE, THE DISTURBING WORLD OF PSYCHOPATH'S AMONG US  by Robert D. Hare (where I got the above quotes of Abbott's). It will  reveal to you what psychopaths like Abbott are really like. It may even  help you escape, unscathed, psychopaths you run into in the future.  (Psychopaths number 2%-3%of the population, so chances are you will run  into one sometime.)	2000-08-06

If all that some reviewers think should  have been included in it had been included in it, it would have been as  thick as the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary.&quot; And there is  repetition, but it is through repitition that one learns and absorbs  things. Your piano teacher doesn't tell you to practice your scales once,  and then try a Bach concerto right away. Let's face it, it's often that you  learn something only after your sick of it! I think that was the author's  intention in repeating many points over and over. I do think that those who  liked this book would like another book titled MILLION DOLLAR HABITS by  Robert Ringer.

Warhol is one of the few &quot;serious&quot;  artists of the 20th Century who had a great sense of humor. It comes across  in this book. The title is meant ironically, so for those upset that it  doesn't have more depth, are missing the entire point of the book,  methinks.

You rarely run across someone who was an old conservative, and is now a new liberal. As the old joke goes, &quot;If  you're under 30 and a conservative, you have no heart. If you're over 30  and a liberal, you have no brain.&quot; Harry Stein managed to develop a  brain. And Stein does a fabulous job of de-glamorizing the  French view that we are just being puritannical in our judgement of  Clinton. And Americans are so in awe of the French sensibility, that a lot  of us let that cow us. But Stein lived in France for years, and he gives  VERY good reasons for why we should not give a whit of credence to their  moral attitudes. There is some overly right-wing sentiment in this book,  that annoys less fanatical Republicans like me. But overall, I was truly  grateful to come across the breath of fresh air that is this book.	2000-08-02

A lot of it is how to run a business, but, as he says, when you invest in a stock, you're investing in a business, so you better know how to run a business, so you can identify a good stock.  One thing I, personally, found helpful--and not everyone will relate--is  that Kiyosaki used to be painfully shy. I've got a shy streak. Kiyosaki  became rich despite his shyness, by overcoming it to a large degree, so  maybe there is hope for timid folks, too, of becoming wealthy. (I saw  Kiyosaki yesterday on &quot;Oprah&quot; and he still has some shyness in  him, that I found endearing...and he is still filthy rich.)	2000-07-29

It's Puzo doing what he does best: making you, emotionally, such a part of a gangster organization, that you actually sympathize with them. They are corrupt, but  within that corruption, have a code they live by. And that is, perversely,  admirable in a way. Talk about cultural relativism! Anyway, this was  probably the best thriller-read I've had since Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE.  Puzo was one of my favorite novelists (he was a gent himself, which made it  that much easier to like his writing), and I was truly saddened when he  died. Even if you're waffling about buying this book, I recommend you do,  because, sadly, there ain't gonna be no more Puzo books after this one.	2000-07-22

Humor comes forth. But the others have that incestuous  MFA-writer's-program-graduate feel to them. They are precious, politically  correct, and rather dull. And they hardly ever have endings. They just kind  of peter out. Perhaps that's being &quot;literary&quot; by not using  &quot;standard&quot; endings. But stories that look like a last page is  missing, are not to be recommended, and I don't recommend this tome.	2000-07-21

I  read the first book, and this book, and like them both as READING  experiences, but I think a lot of them are perhaps garbage, and even if  they are true, are not going to broaden your soul as much as you might  think or have been led to believe.

It holds information that  might in fact change your life.

Not that that in itself is a  sin, but he's so darned SMARMY about it! Ugh! The author of Paul  McCartney's authorized biography MANY YEARS FROM NOW, Barry Miles, knows  Paul McCartney probably as well, if not better, than Fields knows/knew  Linda and Paul.

It's politically incorrect, so the knee-jerk liberals (like those here who gave it one star) won't like it. Reality is reality, whether you like it or not. And this book presents the reality of  what works and what doesn't. I would recommend reading Eric Fromm's  &quot;ESCAPE FROM FREEDOM,&quot; too, because some points that are  incorrect in this book, you can see corrected in that book. But most of the  points made in this book are correct. Just as a child's parents can make or  break his life emotionally, so can culture make or break a country's  economic and political life. Harrison is dead wrong in some of the details,  but his overall point is dead right, and it's refreshing to see someone  make it.

It paints the picture of why liberal activists are so often not benevolent, but selfish, sometimes psychopathic. People with huge egos  like to pat themselves on the back, which is what fuels their activism:  selfishness NOT selflessness is what so often fuels the public liberal.  Einhorn is a (very) extreme example of that. Sometimes the scum, and not  the cream, rises to the top (as Einhorn did for a time). France should be  ashamed of themselves for harboring him. To read more about psychopaths (of  which Einhorn almost certainly is) read the nonfiction WITHOUT CONSCIENCE.  Reading that book will help you spot true evil before it happens.

Which is  why this book is to be commended. It's honest, and daring. I love Africa,  lived there for a time. And you can still see the beauty of it, and still  say &quot;It's a MESS!&quot; Corruption bleeds (which is why we shouldn't  be so cavalier about corruption in the Clinton White House, just because  the Dow Jones is high. Corruption is contagious.) For Keith Richburg to say  he's glad his ancestors were brought over as slaves, because it meant he  got to be an American rather than an African is a VERY controversial thing  to say. Which is why I applaud Mr. Richburg for having the courage to say  it, and for writing this book.	2000-05-05

Some people aren't aware that some people have no consciences. Joseph Wambaugh's THE BLOODING is a great true-crime book about a psychopathic killer in which, when the judge is sentencing the killer at the end, he  tells the killer he hopes that the killer will, &quot;Listen to your  conscience, and feel remorse, as you sit in your prison cell in the coming  years.&quot; But as Wambaugh points out, this judge had it all wrong. This  killer could NOT feel remorse. But instead, would likely sit in his prison  cell reliving his murders with RELISH. And psychopaths are at all levels.  Juanita Broaddrick gave believable information that Bill Clinton had raped  her. And he has a history of lying, as well as sexual aggression. But  Clinton supporters say, &quot;Oh, SHE's lying.&quot; And it is this type of  letting-the-psychopath -off-the-hook that lets them thrive. (And in case  there are any Clinton supporters reading this, Dick Morris wrote in his  diaries of Clinton, &quot;He is incapable of feeling any compassion for  others.&quot; Very psychopathic.) Don't let them off the hook! My family  has known three highly educated, polished, psychopaths. All three impressed  us with their initial charm. After the first two burned us, but didn't  manage, to their regret, to ruin our lives, we met the third one. After his  charm impressed us, we became alert to the fact that his charm was a little  too slick (we knew to watch for this trait after the first two  psychopaths). And we assessed--before we were aware of his having done  anything bad--that he was a psychopath. Eventually it turned out we were  right: he WAS a psychopath. Things he had told us were monstrous lies  (about being an important professional, about having relatives in positions  of power...all lies). He wrecked someone's professional life badly, albeit  temporarily, whom we knew and respected. So keep your eyes open. It is  possible to spot them before they strike. (Which doesn't mean you can STOP  them from striking.) Just very difficult. This book should help you spot  them.	2000-05-03

But Mailer's obsessions get in the way. He likes to dramatize things, and he is obsessed with sex. So Maria wasn't a virgin when she married Oswald, but gave the impression she was: gee, I bet that's a lie a woman has never told before! And Oswald was  still a virgin at age 17. Well, in the 1950's that was probably true of  most 17 year olds! If not over 50% of them, then close to it. And Mailer  makes Oswald sound freakish because he was still a virgin at 17. That's  what I mean about Mailer's obsession with sex (...). So here's a  violent man writing about a violent man, which I find questionable. Mailer  got access to files in Russia, because a go-between told the Russians  Mailer &quot;was America's Tolstoy.&quot; Tolstoy probably turned over in  his grave when those words were said! But if you want to learn more about  Oswald, this book is right up your alley.	2000-05-02

Read SILENT COUP to learn that John Dean was the orchestrator of the Watergate break-in (rather than a victim of it). John Dean said Gordon Liddy was lying about Dean's  role in the break-in. Liddy (as he relates in the introduction of a recent  edition of his autobiography WILL) told Dean to sue. Dean sued. And that  was just what Liddy wanted. Because in a courtroom, Liddy could force Dean  to admit that BLIND AMBITION was filled with lies and falsehoods. Dean did  admit it, but blamed the lies in BLIND AMBITION on his ghost writer!  That's the type man Dean is. Read SILENT COUP for the full story on Dean's  involvement in Watergate.	2000-04-29

From reading the  prose in this book, Bloom never could have written a sonnet or short story  worth a damn. And he's so in love with his own opinions! This book is good  just to look at for the list of important works (although some items I  don't think should be on the list...What in God's name is Gore Vidal doing  on it!  Ugh! ). But I read Harold Bloom, and get the same feeling when I  watch Keanu Reeves in a movie: &quot;What in God's name is THIS person  doing at the top of their professional heap.

Hemingway could write a fine sentence. He wrote some fine stories.  Those fine stories are in this truly fine book. Reading these stories is like catching a fine and fresh trout when fishing  an Idaho stream. Or like downing a fine absinthe after soaking up the oil  on your plate with a fine piece of bread as you look the pretty girls over  at the other tables, as you sit in a clean well-lighted place on the Rue  Jacob in Paris. Or like being a matador pulling a cape over a bull's fine  horns as the bull tries to gore you, but you are too quick and brave for  this fine bull, so you come through the bullfight undefeated, after which  you cut off the bull's ear and present it to Lady Brett Ashley sitting in  the stands.

I reread and reread how he explains that the conscious brain perceives things a half second after they happen, and back-peddles so  it perceives them in real time.

Sad how Mick and Keith dominated things, as when Bill would contribute a bit to a song, and Mick would say, &quot;I wrote that!&quot; And they would call Bill selfish,  when, Who was really being selfish? But Bill Wyman is obsessed with 1) How  much money was in his bank account at any time, and 2) How many women he  slept with. For one thing, he had other things besides his bank account  (car, house), so to try to convince the reader he was broke is a JOKE! And  he, like all men who've slept with thousands of women, assumes everyone  will be impressed with that fact, and not think the man might be sleazy, or  have a psychological problem at the root of such promiscuity. Bill is so  proud that he slept with a lot more women than Mick and Keith. Whoopee,  Bill! If Jagger and Richards had been bedding as many women on tours, as  you were, instead of writing songs in their hotel room, as they were, there  would have been no Stones songs to record!

But since it is  made up of chunks of info, you can't help but find some that will be informative. I personally prefer books by Mark  McCormack, since he built his business up to $700 million. Mackay isn't at  that level. I'll take advice from a champion. And Warren Buffet never  invests in commodity companies (like envelopes), since they depend almost  solely on price competition. Mackay admits that his envelope business  depends on &quot;razor-thin&quot; margins. &quot;One company's envelope  isn't that different than another's,&quot; he writes. (Buffet likes to  invest in brands, like See's Candies, where people aren't going to care  about price so much. So, right off, if Mackay is such a smart business man,  he'd have stayed away from a commodity business). And, since envelopes IS a  commodity business, Mackay really has to know his customers, so as to  manipulate them into buying from him. To do this, he has his subordinates  find out personal, nosey info on his customers. I'd stay away from Mackay  as a customer, because I wouldn't want him trying to find out if I were a  member of Alcoholics  Anonymous, as he does try to do. (I'm not a member of  AA, incidentally!) And another question he asks his employees: &quot;Is  this customer a college graduate? If not, is he insecure about not having a  college degree?&quot; I mean, buy envelopes from Harvey Mackay, and you've  got an FBI file made up on you! No thanks!

One section that fascinated me was about being efficient with time-management. Drucker sites FDR's aide Harry Hopkins as being so sick during WW II, that he literally could only  work a few hours every OTHER day. But that he got MORE work done than  anyone in wartime Washington. Because he was efficient. Winston Churchill  called him, &quot;Lord Heart of the Matter.&quot; I know workaholics who  emotionally deprive their families, but take a martyr-like pleasure in  their workaholism. And, yes, sometimes they are very accomplished. But I  also have a friend in the South of France who is filthy rich, and lives on  a huge estate, and made all his immense wealth on his own. And he still  works full time. And he rarely works more than a six hour day! And  sometimes much less than that! After reading this book, I realized he is  just very efficient. Another good book is Robert Ringer's MILLION DOLLAR  HABITS. He relates how he used to be frustrated to see so many people work  fewer hours than he, but make a lot more money. Then he read a study that  showed the most successful people are not workaholics: they are efficient.  THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE lets you learn new and helpful habits.	2000-04-13

I would like to counter a point made in the March 20 review below, that comments on how Goldman takes credit for the &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; screenplay, that Affleck and Damon won  Oscars for. Goldman is JOKING! He's being SARCASTIC! I don't know how you  could think he was being serious!  He says, (when being unsarcastic)  &quot;I worked one day on the screenplay with them, gave them my opinion  about a section, and that was that.&quot; Apparently some in Hollywood  didn't think two young upstarts could write an Oscar winning screenplay, so  said Goldman must have written it. Goldman is making a JOKE out of that  rumor. Read the section again. GOLDMAN IS NOT TAKING CREDIT, but the exact  opposite. And as far as the bitter tone, Robert Redford said this:  &quot;All writers have a lot of anger.&quot; It's hard to avoid among  literary persons. And I'm glad he takes digs at others in the industry in  this book. Writers are so important to movies, but they are treated like  they are worthless (compared to directors and stars), and have little  power. The one place they can vent their spleens is in books, and I'm more  than happy to see them let off some steam, while entertaining me at the  same time.	2000-03-24

She was beautiful, and I would have loved to have been one of  those matadors she had an affair with!  A good, undemanding Hollywood book  to read.	2000-03-20

Wambaugh has afascination with sociopaths, because they feel no guilt, and Wambaugh, who was raised as a Catholic, thus had guilt hammered into his head, can't comprehend feeling no guilt, so is fascinated by them. Such fascination helped makes this a good book.	2000-03-19

And I recently saw Ringo Starr in concert, and he was much more charismatic than  I thought he would be (and I'm a Beatles NUT, so I didn't think he'd be  boring!).

Any little scraps of clippings on them or interviews, he'll put it between covers, which has often resulted in some lousy books. (That he's a lousy writer doesn't  matter with this book, as it is a collection of previously published  interviews). And in this book are a lot of interviews the diehard Beatles  fan will have read elsewhere. But, like a good pack rat, there ARE some  interviews, and some very good ones, that you likely have not read before,  of the Fab Four. So, if you are an obsessive Beatles fan like myself,  there's enough good stuff (along with the bad) in this book, that I  recommend it. It's a bit thicker than most of the author's books, so you  get a decent collection of interviews.	2000-03-17

I had, though, seen their video &quot;25 x 5&quot; and thought it cheating to reproduce in this book quotes that I'd already seen them say in that video.  But most of the quotes are new. And seeing all they've done on the road,  singing to stadiums full of people, made me sometimes think as I looked  through it that that is the only life worth living. I've seen the Stones  live, and when they come out, it is such an adrenaline rush that goes  through the audience. Can you imagine the adrenaline rush of the guys on  stage!	2000-03-13

It's not an admirable, mix, and it's a mix that comes across on every one of these pages. I was especially apalled at the way he dismissed  Mick Jagger, and is snotty toward him, saying the Rolling Stones were  jealous when the press paid more attention to Trump, when they played one  of his casinos. Trust me, it's Trump who was feeling jealous of them. And  Trump should remember that businessmen are not remembered through history.  Artists (and military men) are, and the Stones music will be listened to,  and Mick Jagger long remembered, long after Trump is long forgotten.	2000-03-12

This gives a good profile of the average multi-millionaire, and lets you know what to emulate in your attempts to get where they are. That good grades do not equal financial success in the  future I know well, because one of my best friends from high school made  the FORBES 400 list. When I first met him in high school, I asked him what  grade he was in. He said, &quot;Well, I'm supposed to be a junior. But my  record is so bad, I think I'm technically still a sophomore.&quot; (Hardly  the sign of a good student!) As far as good SAT scores not guaranteeing  future wealth: this same friend of mine--when applying to a college that  wasn't hard to get into--knew he wasn't &quot;smart&quot; enough to score  well on the SAT's, so he had his more academic brother take the SAT's for  him (they looked a lot alike). As a result he got into the college he  wanted to...and then dropped out...and went on to become worth more than  1/2 a billion dollars. These are the types that appear over and over in  these pages. (Although I have to doubt that millionaires are consistently  ethical, as this book claims. My friend illegally had his brother take the  SAT's, and my friend also was my only friend in high school that went  around stealing car stereos). That's my one complaint about the book,  having people THEMSELVES say that being honest was part of their success.  How many dishonest men say they are dishonest?  That's for others to  decide. And we all know of robber barons in history who ended up filthy  rich, by being dishonest. But everything else in this book is helpful, and  well worth reading. Hey, reading this book may mean the difference between  being rich and poor. In that case, it's probably worth the purchase price.	2000-03-11

If you can't comprehend marginal characters, you're going to just be turned off by the characters in this play. But they are desperate characters, and unforgettable  characters. Tennesee Williams' big flaw for me, was that he wasn't really  able to comprehend affection in romantic relationships, but only lust. When  Stanley talks about getting &quot;them colored lights going&quot; again  when Blanche moves out, Williams reveals that he can't comprehend  three-dimensional romances. But that is the only flaw in the play, and the  rest of it is truly brilliant. You do need an attention span to read this,  since plays are basically made up of long speeches. I once rented the  Brando-film video to watch with a friend, and he looked at me like I'd  forced him to eat sawdust. His idea of drama was a Jon Claude Van Damme  film. So, if your idea of entertainment is mainly dopey action films and  MTV, stay away. But if you have patience, and a love of intense literature,  you'll take an emotional journey when you experience this play. (The Brando  movie has a relatively happy ending, but the written play, that Brando  starred in on Broadway, has an unhappy ending. They both have their  strengths, so I'd recommend you see/read both endings).	2000-03-09

Envy is envy. It helped me feel a little less lonely, reading of others who are envious. One of my best friends from high school took his company  public a few years ago, and it made him worth over $500 million!  You don't  know envy until that has happened to a friend of yours! (Luckily--for my  mental health--his company got in big trouble shortly after, and his wealth  shrank. He's still worth tens of millions...but that isn't as bad as when  he was worth hundreds of millions). So I know envy! And this book helped me  a bit with it. A good literary novel that deals with envy is Martin Amis'  THE INFORMATION.	2000-03-09

Parts of it I'd already read, as excerpts in &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine before this was published. But there is plenty new, even for &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine subscribers. He  tells wonderful anecdotes about working with Clint Eastwood and others, and  how he once stood next to Sylvester Stallone by a swimming pool, to find he  is little over 5'5&quot; (! ). And of course, there is plenty about  screenwriting. He includes an unfinished screenplay toward the end, that he  has other successful screenwriters critique, some of whom do it brutally!  (But the screenplay has so much that is inept about it, I just wonder if  Goldman's writing chops are gone. In his 1969 book THE SEASON, about  Broadway, Goldman wrote about two critics who were about Goldman's age now,  and he thought their best days were behind them, and wondered if they  shouldn't have been &quot;put out to pasture.&quot; Well, now that  Goldman's that old, he might not like it so much when I say perhaps he  sould be put out to pasture, too. That might sound harsh, but read his  partial screenplay in the book. For one thing, he names a male character  Shirley! ). Anyway, the non-script parts of the book are first-rate, and  some of them movingly personal. This isn't as good as its prequel, nor  could it be. But Goldman is a true insider, and tells secrets of all types  that few people have, and even fewer people are willing, or able, to tell.	2000-03-09

It flushed out some of the info about the Sex Pisols for  me. Perhaps I'm the audience it's best for. I don't know much about the  Pistols (though I love their music), and from this I learned about them.  The negative reviews below seem largely by those who know a lot about the  Pistols already, up to every obsessive detail, and wanted to know stuff  besides them.

I'd read elsewhere about Jim's gay  experimentation, but this book spells it out more, and reveals that someone  who had a gay dalliance with him blackmailed him. Max Fink, Jim's lawyer,  was who he confided in regarding this stuff, and it was touching that Jim  wrote to Max that he was &quot;the father I never had&quot; (since Jim's  dad was always away on a navy ship). Any Doors or Jim Morrison fan will  find the new revelations in this book of interest, as I did.	2000-02-18

It was painted with a bit to broad of a brush, and I would have liked McCormack to have been a little more detailed in spots. And one thing he advises is  pushing yourself while watching the clock...and some of this book has a  hasty feel of someone pushing (for instance, he refers to Clint Eastwood's  movie &quot;Magnum Force&quot; as a WESTERN! Most movie goers know that  &quot;Magnum Force&quot; was a modern-day cop movie. That's one example of  sloppiness that shouldn't have gone past McCormack's nor his editors'  eyes.) But  McCormack has built up his business from scratch, to a $700  million business (privately held, too, and not an overvalued public  company, like so many internet companies). So many advice books are written  by people who aren't accomplished themselves, and so you can be reassured  that THIS advice will likely work! So it is good advice, and I'm going to  study the book much in the future.	2000-02-18

I found the bits about Jim that I hadn't seen in other biographies the interesting points. There have been suggestions about Morrison's gay experimenting in other  books, but this book gives a bit more detail about the circumstances under  which they took place. Also, why he hated his parents: he said he once told  his mother when he was a boy, that he had been molested, and she didn't  believe him, and he hated her after that. The book isn't that well written,  but the author did research where other Morrison biographers haven't, and  it's those new facts that make this an interesting read.	2000-02-09

I think THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV a masterpiece, and it is also  about a murder. But CRIME AND PUNISHMENT doesn't deserved its classic  status. And Nabokov detested Dostoevsky, because he didn't like the idea of  characters coming to spiritual awakening through horrendous acts. And,  while I think Dostoevsky was a better writer than Nabokov thought he was,  that's one of the problems I had with this book: In the end you're supposed  to feel uplifted by         Raskolnikov's &quot;awakening,&quot; but all I  could think was, &quot;But the guy murdered two women! He should be drowned  in the river he is standing near!&quot;	2000-02-09

The charisma of his personality translated to the page.

And  Capote's interview with one of the Manson family is fascinating, in that it  relates a different (than Bugliossi's), and believable theory for why the  Manson murders went down.

And for a bio that  suggests it will deliver new stuff about Jagger's sex life, it is ineptly  researched. This bio says, basically, &quot;there have been rumours of  Jagger having gay affairs, but there is no evidence of it.&quot; Well, I  have an old &quot;Interview&quot; magazine that includes an interview  Jagger gave when promoting his first solo album. And in that interview  Jagger admits to having had a number of gay dalliances. None of them  serious, he points out. And he laughed about it. No big deal. Which it  isn't.

But I happened across it  in a library, and, unlike his radio interview, the book is actually a  reasonably sober, even-handed telling of his working for the Lennons  (without such insane theories, thankfully). There are a few spots where you  wonder if Seaman is exagerrating or withholding information to suit his own  purposes. But overall it gives an interesting take on Lennon. Lennon is  kind of pathetic in spots (his subordination to Yoko's will at times makes  you wonder how much individuality he got when he left the Beatles. He might  as well have stayed with the Beatles, for all the &quot;freedom&quot;  leaving them gave him.) If Seaman is right, it looks as though John and  Yoko were headed for a divorce just before he was murdered. John relates to  Seaman that when he was a boy, he witnessed his mother Julia serve as a  prostitute for men on occasion. And John, even though, or because of, his  preaching peace and love, admitted to Seaman that he had fantasies of  crucifying women and disemboweling women. He said in a &quot;Playboy&quot;  interview that &quot;It's the most violent people who go on about peace all  the time.&quot; Well, he may have reformed his violent actions (he used to  beat his first wife, he and Cynthia both admitted), but he still had  violent thoughts. Unpleasant insights like this, as well as some pleasant  ones, into Lennon, make this a worthwhile book for the diehard Beatle fan.	2000-01-10

Power over you and me. Those who think this book is slanted against Hillary: Granted, there are sarcastic comments  between the facts that mar its otherwise objective tone. But the facts  themselves are indisputable! Hillary Clinton said under oath she never did  legal work on Castle Grande or Madison Guarantee...then those  files that  magically appeared on a table in the White House showed that she HAD done  such legal work! She committed perjury, boys and girls. If you or I had  done what she did, we'd be reading this website from a computer in our  prison cells!  And it's not the only time she committed a Federal crime.  Read the book to find out the other times. Clinton said at his inauguration  that his administration would be &quot;the most ethical in the history of  the republic.&quot; That was his first lie, but certainly not his last, as  President of that same republic.

CATCH 22 is a funny novel. LUCKY JIM is amusing, and made me smile, not laugh. But it is also brilliant. One of the best novels I've  ever read.	2000-01-06

And it was not even close to the finest  thriller I've ever read. The plot is thin, and strung together. Granted,  the writing itself is good, but it didn't accumulate into a satisfying  whole. Not nearly. I'll stick to Frederick Forsythe thrillers.	2000-01-06
2692249:US	50424562	R24YS5YLEQS6V1	0671625365	179223441	Confessions of a Street-Smart Manager	Books	5	3	3	N	N	First-rate	This a readable book by a very successful man, who shares the basis of his success (and of others he's worked with, including Norton Simon). He is a noncomformist in a business suit, who has questioned orthodoxy and the  status quo, to the benefit of his bank account. I'm surprised it is out of  print, because it deserves to be the business classic that the lesser (but  still valuable) WHAT THEY DON'T TEACH YOU AT HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL is.	2000-01-05

And Crichton is ripping himself off here. JURASSIC PARK and THE LOST WORLD  were fish-out-of-water-in-another-time (so to speak) books. Crichton  directed the movie &quot;West World&quot; and THAT was a  fish-out-of-water.... movie (suburbanites in the old west). And here it is  again. I wouldn't mind Crichton mining the same vein, if he did it  successfully. But since he's failing at it (&quot;Westworld&quot; was his  only successful attempt at that plot, I think), he should try a different  plot on for size.	1999-12-31

Not everything in here is accessible to everyone--what if you have certain severe health problems--but for a lot of people, it should prove a practical guide to attaining things in life you  need in the pursuit of happiness. The best testimonial I can give for this  book is that I once saw Robert Ringer himself in the Fashion Island  shopping mall in Newport Beach, Calif., with his beautiful mulato  wife...and they looked very very happy.	1999-12-26
