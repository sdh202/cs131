1288559:US	50200864	R2KFB0B6HYB7ON	0786710861	880123332	Spook: A Nameless Detective Novel	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Nameless Returns Gloriously	Bill Pronzini's Nameless series of detective novels is perhaps the most underappreciated series in crime fiction history.  It has been running since Nixon was operating a recording studio in the White House, and SPOOK is entry number thirty in this unique literary achievement.  Mr. Pronzini almost chose to end the series with his previous Nameless novel--BLEEDERS.  He didn't, and I am certain every reader, writer, and member of the worldwide mystery community is grateful.  I know I am.<br />SPOOK adds fresh twists to the Nameless series.  Nameless is back, arranging for his semi-retirement with the same moral and ethical anchors that have been hallmarks of this character since the 1970s.  He has given Tamara Corbin a full partnership in their agency, and they've hired a new operative Jake Runyon, a man with a troubled past.  Kerry and their recently adopted daughter, Emily, are on hand preparing to celebrate Christmas.<br />Subplots abound, yet the main storyline is engrossing.  Nameless is hired to discover the identity of a murdered homeless man.  The story involves long-buried crimes, and Mr. Pronzini uses Tamara's and Jake's narrative voices, in addition to the classic voice of Nameless, to tell the story.<br />SPOOK is full of surprises and marks a privotal point in the Nameless series.  I am thrilled that the series continues, and I hope that this book finally gets Nameless the wide public recognition/readership the character deserves.  Wouldn't it be nice if TIME or NEWSWEEK paid homage to Bill Pronzini at this point in his career?  It happened once to Ross Macdonald, as well as certain other crime fiction authors.	2002-12-30

I am genuinely impressed by Andy Straka's A KILLING SKY, though, initially, I expected to be disappointed.  After all, his debut novel, A WITNESS ABOVE, was simply stunning, and I doubted if he could follow up such a strong work (nominated for an Agatha) with an equally well-written work.  His storyline also appeared to be lifted from the headlines (Clinton or Condit, take your choice)with the vanished daughter of a philandering politician taking center stage, and his series set-up bears a strong resemblance to the Spenser series with its literate PI, enforcer-type sidekick, sophisticated love interest, and a pet featured prominently in the story.  Finally, having met Andy Straka at a recent mystery convention and having participated on one author panel with the man, I am quite impressed by Mr. Straka as a person and a writer.  I didn't want to be disappointed by his sophomore effort so I delayed reading A KILLING SKY.<br />My mistake.  In A KILLING SKY, Andy Straka pulls everything together perfecly.  Falconry is Frank Pavlicek's trademark, and it is featured prominently.  He clearly distinguishes Frank from Spenser, Toronto from Hawk, and Marcia from Susan.  His development of Frank's daughter Nicole into a well-rounded sidekick-type character is also a unique touch.<br />The tale he tells, he tells well.  The politico Drummond is no Clinton or even a Condit.  The story takes several unexpected turns, and the writing is first-rate.  A KILLING SKY is a giant step forward for this new mystery series.  I am hoping for many more Frank Pavlicek mysteries.	2002-05-12

Career changes are iffy moves at best, but Rod Norville has made a wise choice retiring from the Silicon Valley techno-wars to write fiction.  His debut work, MOONSHINE EXPRESS, simply shines.  I salute Mr. Norville upon the dawn of his great new career.<br />Categorizing this novel is difficult.  While it seems to be written as a young adult novel, it is also an extremely satisfying adult read.  MOONSHINE EXPRESS tells the story of a thirteen-year-old who is coming of age in Florida in the early sixties.  Rob is the novel's protagonist, and Katie is Rob's childhood playmate who is well on her way into evolving into the boy's romantic interest.<br />Rob and Katie are two admirable young people from opposite ends of their town's socio/economic spectrum.  Rob's father has become the town drunk since the death of Rob's mother.  Katie's father is a doctor who is also the owner of the key business enterprise in their town.  Rob and Katie discover a moonshining operation, and the plot steams forward from there.<br />Norville's story accurately captures his setting's time and place.  He captures the attitudes of the people of that era.  I heard echoes of Faulkner in Norville's view of the South, and I believe this book will be an excellent addition to any school library, young person's bookshelf, or adult's reading list. <br />It is a fabulous work for a first-time author!	2002-05-02

Though countless PI authors (I know too well of what I speak) have been compared to the giants of this genre, giants with names such as Hammett, Chandler, and Macdonald, Estleman is the writer of our time who holds the best claim to a seat at the table with these immortals.  His PI creation, Amos Walker, remains as contemporary as the Rust Belt yet as classic as a Model T.<br />In SINISTER HEIGHTS, Walker is hired by the youngish widow of an automobile industry pioneer to locate the illegitimate heirs to her late husband's furtune.  She claims she wants to do right for these offshoots of the family tree, and Walker's investigation lands him in the middle of a complicated plot that moves fast and doesn't stop.  Murders and other crimes soon follow.  Estleman takes his reader on a joyride around post-industrial America, complete with Cayman Island bank accounts.<br />As Robert Parker did in his recent POTSHOT, Estleman features many secondary characters from past Walker novels.  This element gives SINISTER HEIGHTS a nostalgic feel for the experienced Estleman reader and adds an enormous depth to his story.  <br />SINISTER HEIGHTS is among Loren Estleman's finest works.	2002-03-18

Parker largely reinvented the mystery sub-genre of the tough-guy private eye novel.  He showed us all how to update this traditional American prototypical character for today's sensibilities, and Parker's Spenser has earned a place among the most popular of our age's PIs.<br />As does his beloved Red Sox, Parker sends a fresh Spenser mystery onto the field of play every year.  Each spring, Spenser seems like a championship creation.  Every novel is consistently thrilling, witty, unpredictable, and, in the end, a bit heartbreaking.  This series is obviously written by a Red Sox fan.  One knows when they begin that in the end all will not be idyllic.<br />WIDOW'S WALK fits this Spenser mold perfectly.  Parker is amazingly consistent.  In this novel, Spenser is hired by Rita Fiore (an series semi-regular)to help build her defense for her client Mary Smith.  Mary's husband, Nathan, of Mayflower lineage, is murdered.  Mary, his much younger and terribly unfaithful, widow is everyone's, including Rita's, favorite suspect.<br />Spenser springs into action.  Pearl the Wonder Dog is on hand.  Susan is here, and, of course, so is Hawk.  WIDOW'S WALK has all we have grown to expect from Parker's series.  The witty dialog snaps rapidly throughout.  Parker's social observations are astute.  The true origin of the crime rests with a real estate scam.  As one reads WIDOW'S WALK, one has to hope that this year the Red Sox will actually find a way to win the World Series in October.  The last time Parker's team won it, the Series was played in September.<br />WIDOW'S WALK is an excellent novel.	2002-03-18

Ms. Anderson has taken the police procedural into the Twenty-First Century with this unique mystery merging a traditional fair-play whodunit with a police procedural and updated with the technology of the World Wide Web.<br />Claire Jenson is a downstate Illinois widow who is faced with another loss when her daughter True is murdered in the big bad city of Chicago.  Chicago detective Marty Slade is assigned to the case, and he soon begins to become absorbed in the homicide investigation.<br />In many ways, MURDER ONLINE is a perfectly structured mystery.  Ms. Anderson presents the set-up in the opening chapter.  She introduces the major characters early on and begins the development of her varied subplots, immediately hooking her reader into her novel.  Her novel ends with a cleverly dangerous plot climax.<br />There is a suggestion of romance between the widow and the detective.  There are sibling rivalries between the murder victim and her sister that may have contributed to the murder.  The suspects all appear on stage in one guise or another.  The clues are provided, yet they are only obvious in retrospect. The multible themes are well developed.<br />A central focus of MURDER ONLINE involves the dark side of the Internet and its chatrooms.  Claire takes it upon herself to hunt down her daughter's murderer in cyberspace.  Ms. Anderson presents a disturbing picture of Internet stalking as Claire and Marty eventually uncover the identity of True's murderer.<br />When her reader finishes this novel, Ms. Anderson has certainly made her point about the disturbed people who can lurk among the strands of the World Wide Web. There are definitely sick people out there, shielding their identities and committing disgustingly harmful acts via their Internet hook-ups.<br />I read this book in one sitting, and I certainly recommend it highly.	2002-01-19

The stories in this collection feature the &quot;first&quot; cases of many of today's leading sleuths.  Unlike many short story anthologies, there is a great range in tone and subject matter in this FIRST CASES volume.  Some stories are cozies while others are hardboiled.  All fit somewhere across our genre's spectrum.<br />I was pointed to this short story collection by my favorite mystery bookseller.  I told her I needed a fresh text for this upcoming semester's course on writing mystery short stories that I regularly teach in the California State University system.  Students in that class usually have a wide range of writing interests, and FIRST CASES--VOLUME 3 provides models that can apply to their varying literary efforts.  It features stories by Tony Hillerman, Gar Anthony Haywood, Laura Lippman, Lawrence Block, Maxine O'Callaghan, and Anne Perry, among others.  There is even a Talmage Powell story dating from the mystery genre's pulp fiction years.  I am quite pleased with this collection, and it is now among my course's required texts when this semester's course begins soon.	2002-01-06

Bill Pronzini dedicates BLEEDERS to himself &quot;without whom this series would never have been written.&quot;<br />As in the recent Nameless mysteries, Nameless is showing his age and his maturity.  He is realizing that, while his work is important to him, there is more to life than merely running his PI agency.  He is married now, of course, and he has an adopted daughter he acquired in the previous novel.  His family responsibilities are becoming more and more important to him.<br />The plotline of this story involves a grifting scheme that leads to murders.  It nearly costs Nameless his life, too.  As with all Pronzini works, the book moves far beyond the mystery genre and addresses serious moral themes.  As always, Pronzini is a moralistic writer in the best senses of the term.<br />The plot works fabulously, and the characters seem realistic.  The interaction between everyone on stage couldn't work better.  In the end, Nameless realizes his name is Daddy.  It is bestowed on him by his adopted daughter, and he decides to make certain major life changes.<br />While it is suggested throughout the work that BLEEDERS may mark the end of this long-running series, I hope the series continues.  Bill Pronzini, in my opinion, is the finest mystery writer of his generation.  The influence of this series will long be felt in the mystery genre.  His Nameless character may now be Daddy to a little girl, yet he has always been the father of the private detectives created by those of us who have begun our writing careers in recent years.	2002-01-03

With this edition, I particularly enjoyed the deailed census data as well as THE WORLD ALMANAC's thorough coverage of Major League Baseball.  This year's news photos were excellent.  So was the coverage of the events of September 11 and its aftermath, a story that was still evolving as the almanac was being prepared for publication.  All in all, THE WORLD ALMANAC 2002 is a extraordinary work.	2001-12-10

Jacob is the upstate New Yorker who has finally struck it rich as a writer by peddling an embarrassing script to Hollywood that was made into an even more embarrassing movie.  He'd spent decades writing artistic works before his sudden wealth, yet now he doesn't even mind having writer's block.  He keeps himself busy solving murders.<br />Jacob, fortunately, has many homicidal friends.  In this fourth series book, Jacob and some fellow parents are attempting to convince the principal of their local elementary school to establish a gifted and talented program.  The principal ends up dead, and Jacob realizes he must solve the crime.  He is the individual most thoroughly acquainted with this dead principal's society.<br />Mr. Witten achieves an ideal tone in this light-hearted mystery.  I enjoyed the way he handled his various suspects, especially the single-mother initially arrested for the crime.  Mr. Witten has spent some time around public education, and he knows the school environment well.  He skewers the education bureaucracy with expertise, and his repeated comments about America's obsession with standardized tests are perfectly accurate.  Every teacher I know who has read THE KILLING BEE agrees with those views.  The various teacher-types and parent-types were fun to watch, as was the odd school board member who had more than his share of hidden secrets.<br />All in all, I believe THE KILLING BEE is Matt Witten's finest book yet.  His plot is first-rate, and his recurring characters are enjoyable as Jacob juggles crime solving with family responsibilities involving a wife and two children.  This book could not have been a more enjoyable read.	2001-11-30

With her sixth Lupe Solano mystery BITTER SUGAR, Ms. Garcia-Aguilera keeps her reputation improving.  In this novel, Lupe finds herself hired by an old friend of her father's.  The expatriate Cuban sugar planter wants Lupe to investigate the details of a business proposal involving sugar plantations that had been held by his family for nearly two centuries before Castro's revolution.  A homicide soon occurs, and Lupe finds herself dragged once more into an adventure suited perfectly for a contemporary American woman with proud ties to her Cuban roots.  As always, Lupe and her supporting characters are major attractions of this series.  Ms. Garcia-Aguilera's presentation of the minlging of cultures in the Florida of today is another treat I especially enjoy.  BITTER SUGAR is among the best of the Lupe Solano series, and I recommend it heartily.	2001-11-28

Mari Ulmer's MIDNIGHT AT THE CAMPOSANTO is a perfect example of the unique voices now appearing in the mystery field.  Ms. Ulmer has written a terrific book.  It spins a tale as good as any being published by the big houses today, yet it also features elements that would never appear in the books of America's major publishing houses.  Her protagonist, Christina Garcia y Grant is an admirable creation, as are Christy's supporting characters.  Ms. Ulmer's story reveals a deep and thorough understanding of the mixture of cultures that has occurred in northern New Mexico.  Her plot moves swiftly, twisting and turning as her story progresses.  Her dialog snaps to life from the printed page.  Her characters are fully realized, yet it is her setting and that setting's cultural depth that made MIDNIGHT AT THE CAMPOSANTO such a fulfilling read for me.  Ms. Ulmer knows what she is writing about, and she writes as well as anyone working today.	2001-11-26

Lorie Ham, her Alexandra Walters series, and her new THE TROUBLE WITH TENORS proves this point perfectly.  Ms. Ham has created a fresh mystery series with a unique perspective.  Her protagonist, Alex, is a Christian singer and a single mother.  The novel is set against the backdrop of a gospel music convention in a town in California's Central Valley.  Alex's ex-husband is in town for the convention, and he wants custody of their child Jessica.  Alex lets her ex know she will do anything to stop him from stealing her child and soon the ex ends up shot dead.  Ms. Ham spins a great mystery tale from there, piling on suspects with good reasons to want the victim dead.  The plot is filled with action, and Alex's boyfriend, a PI with Mafia connections, plays a major part.  While Alex and many of her associates are Christian, their religious beliefs do not dominate the story.  Their faith merely makes up elements of their characters.  THE TROUBLE WITH TENORS is a terrific new mystery by an up-and-coming author.	2001-11-25

The governor orders speed traps all over Tangier Island.  In retaliation, Tangier Island's residents decide to withdraw their piece of paradise from the commonwealth.

I try to read widely to discover which books succeed and which books fail. ...  Mr. Borovik's THE HIDDEN WAR succeeds.  It provides a view of a superpower befuddled in a war with an impoverished nation that failed to understand the basic truth that poor countries must always let the superpowers have their way.  THE HIDDEN WAR reveals the Soviet government's confusion with its war and its aims in that land now called Afghanistan.  It reveals how Soviet soldiers lived, fought, died, and felt during that national misadventure.  There are obviously echoes from another superpower's misadventure in another chunk of Asia--to the south and to the east.  This book is important.  It needs to be read by anyone really wants to be an informed citizen.	2001-10-10

Yes, Sierra Lavotini is on the case, and this case is loaded with fun.  There is even a little fun for Sierra to share with her detective friend John Nailor.  FILM STRIP is a fun read and sassy read, if you are looking for a fun and sassy read.  Even Fluffy has a good time.	2001-10-10

Gavin Kelly is the military man in one of America's most unusual military adventures.  One of the men under Kelly's command shoots a Somali a short while after their unit lands on the shore.  Kelly must decide how to act and what to do.  This is a serious story that also explores the problems of contemporary military action by a superpower in the developing world.  It is a morality tale for our ambiguous age and an important book now more than ever.	2001-10-09

In many ways, Perez-Reverte's latest novel is a modernized take on the MALTESE FALCON.  Manuel Coy, a sailor drifting aimlessly, attends an auction where he witnesses Tanger Soto, a beautiful blonde working for a Madrid museum, win the bidding for a 17th Century atlas that may reveal the location of Dei Gloria, a legendary Jesuit ship sunk in 1767 by pirates seeking its priceless cargo of emeralds.  A ruthless contemporary band of crooked salvaging pirates are also seeking the ship for their far less noble motives.  Coy enlists on Tanger's side, and a romance develops amid the danger as the various characters pursue the sunken treasure.  I recommend this book highly.	2001-10-01

I genuinely enjoyed Stephanie Laurens' ALL ABOUT PASSION.  Gyles Rawlings, an honorary Cynster, decides that the time has come for the Fifth Earl of Chillingworth, himself, to marry.  Living in Regency England, he elects to marry for dynastic reasons, not love.  He selects a distant relative named Francesca whom he believes will provide him with heirs yet not engage his heart.  To the best of his knowledge, she is supposedly a docile blonde who will honor her obligations meekly and not trouble his soul.  This dynastic marriage is arranged, sight unseen.  Upon his wedding day, he discovers he's contracted to marry the wrong woman.  The Francesca he has mistakenly agreed to marry is a passionate woman who will challenge his heart.  The other woman was her cousin with the same name.  Sexual tension saturates this work, and Gyles finds himself reluctantly drawn to his wife and her loving passion.  Things don't work out exactly the way the Earl planned, especially when Francesca's life becomes threatened.  ALL ABOUT PASSION is a fun read.	2001-10-01

In case you don't remember, Jesse is the former LAPD officer who was fired for drinking on the job and landed as police chief in a crime-challenged Massachuetts town.  Basically, think of Jesse as Spenser with a drinking problem.  This time, a body of a teenaged girl is found, and Jesse investigates her murder.  The investigation leads him into the world of child exploitation.  Subplots include Jesse adjusting to his new life and re-adjusting to his old ex-wife.  Parker has another winner here.

Vachss tells a noirish tale concerning Burke being hired to find Rosebud. Rosebud is no sled.  She's the missing teenaged daughter of an oddly secretive and chemically-burdened family.  Drugs, pain management drugs, also play a part in the novel's second plotline, and eventually the two stories converge.  Excellent read.

In this new novel, Rei, a Californian-born yet Tokyo-based antique dealer, accompanies a valuable collection of kimonos for display at a D.C. museum.  Upon arrival in Washington, Rei finds nothing but trouble.  Hugh Glendinning, her old lover, descends upon her at a social function, complicating her current relationship with Takeo Kayama.

Assistant District Attorney Alex Cooper finds herself involved on a deeply personal level in the homicide investigation into the death of Lola Dakota, an abused wife who was also a brilliant university professor.  While Lola refused to cooperate with prosecuting her husband for domestic abuse charges while she was alive, her death changes things.  The husband becomes Alex's prime suspect, but he seems to be in the clear because he was arrested a short time before the killing.  The chief clue is a paper with the word &quot;deadhouse&quot; and a series of numbers scribbled on it.  The deadhouse turns out to be an ancient hospital where smallpox victims once went to die.  Ms. Fairstein steams onward from there, and THE DEADHOUSE is a fabulous read.  I recommend it highly.	2001-09-30

Fortunately, it appears now that our nation has dodged that bullet on this occasion, but this book is a must-read work.  The journalists who collaborated on GERMS present frightening details involving the possibilitiy of biological warfare in our modern age.  They also report on our government's attempts to prepare for and, we hope, prevent such an attack.  We are living a new age.  Warfare will not be what we have witnessed in the past.

His plot, with a surprising twist at the end, is first-rate.  His characters are believable.  His setting is too perfect.  I recommend A MAIDEN'S GRAVE highly.	2001-09-18

Reeve, a respected journalist, has done some magnificent research here.  In THE NEW JACKALS, Reeve clearly explains the methods of our world's leading terorrists, their backgrounds, their motivations, and why they are a genuine threat to our way of life.

Jack is now in his thirties, and he's left the LAPD.  He's living in western Wisconsin where a horror story is occurring.  A serial killer is butchering children and dining on their bodies.  Jack has no specific memories of the Territories (from THE TALISMAN), but we all know that King and Straub are too talented of professionals to let this poor fellow be.  Jack finds himself roped into the investigation and haunted by wide-awake dreams and half-memories of the Territories.  You can guess where this book is heading--straight to the top of the bestseller lists.	2001-09-17

Having spent some time in her first career as an internist, Tess Gerritsen puts her medical kowledge to good use in this thriller.  A serial killer strikes Boston, and a detective named Thomas Moore (called by some Saint Thomas because he is faithfully mourning his deceased wife) begins his investigation.  This serial killer is no Boston Strangler.  He butchers his victims with expert medical knowledge.  The press labels him The Surgeon.  While doing background research, Moore discovers that a serial killer in a distant city operated in a similar manner years earlier.  That killer was finally stopped when he made a run at the wrong woman, and she shot him.  Dr. Catherine Cordell, that woman, now practices in Boston, and the current killer seems to be working his way closer to Catherine.  Catherine knows it.  So does Saint Thomas, who is becoming emotionally connected to Catherine following his lengthy period of mourning.  It soon becomes obvious that Catherine's assistance will be necessary to stop The Surgeon's butchery.  She is buried under fear of this copycat killer.  Or is killer really a copycat?  THE SURGEON is a thrilling thriller.  Read it soon.	2001-09-16

Phillip Margolin is moving onto your turf, and Margolin's THE ASSOCIATE is a magnificent legal thriller.  This novel centers on Daniel Ames, an associate at a preppy law firm.  Dan has working class roots, and he's assigned to sort through reams of legal documents before his firm's client turns them over to the other side.  Dan's firm is representing a drug company, and the lawsuit implicates one of the company's drugs as the cause of horrible birth defects.  While a letter surfaces that seems to indicate his client's guilt, Dan isn't quite so sure.  As in any good legal thriller, motive,opportunity, and means become key questions, and other crimes, including homicide, occur.  Margolin has a winner here.  I recommend it heartily.	2001-09-14

We all have dreams, and that dream is one of mine.  GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN is a multi-layered novel dealing with the African-American experience during and after the massive migration of African-Americans from the rural south to the urban north.  He has fully fleshed-out characters, a sophisticated plot, and a narrative vocie perfectly suited to his subject matter.  Seldom has a better book been written.

THE BLUE LAST is Ms. Grimes's current work, and it has a fascinating premise.  Over fifty years ago, was an identity switch perpetrated during the chaos of World War II?  Jury investigates.  The usual characters are on the scene.  There are some clever sub-plots.  The main story takes several unexpected twists and turns.  THE BLUE LAST is a winner.

Mr. Wright tells the story of Bigger Thomas and the world of poverty, discrimination, and desperation in which he is trapped.  When he murders a white woman in a moment of panic, there is no way for Bigger to escape his doom.  NATIVE SON takes on what America was like in Wright's time, an America eerily similar to the America of today in too many ways.	2001-09-14

Dad never mentioned the quasi-police state the populist governor established while he ruled Louisiana.  While in college, I first read Robert Penn Warren's fictionalized treatment of the founder of the Long Dynasty.  ALL THE KING'S MEN tells the story of Willie Stark, an initially idealistic small-town pol who learns how to win big by losing first.  Jack Burden, Stark's idealistic hatchetman, narrates the tale and shows the reader how Willie becomes slowly corrupted by wealth, power, and ego.  I've read this book many times, and each time I find myself fascinated by the moral ambiguities of the Stark character.  Willie got into politics to do good.  Even at the end, he still believes he is on the side of right battling the forces of evil.  In his novel, Robert Penn Warren wrote, I contend, the most perceptive biography of Huey Long ever written.  ALL THE KING'S MEN is a literary landmark of the last century.	2001-09-14

I realize I'm a biased reader, though.  Jack made me some money.  During the years Jack served as CEO of GE, I did hold some stock in his company.  That stock did okay while he was in charge.  But, so what?  His book is still an enjoyable read.  He tells how he succeeded in business by really trying.  He stayed out of the pack and rose to the top.  As an economics instructor, I found his observations about corporate culture and suggestions about managment style well worth the price of the book.  He talks about some of his correct decisions as well as some of his mistakes.  He reveals quite a bit of personality.  I enjoyed this book.  For an icon of contemporary American capitalism, Jack Welch is living a fairly interesting life.	2001-09-12

I think highly of all of his works, and I consider his ADVENTURES OF AUGIE MARCH among his finest novels.  To some degree, I suppose because of its title, I've always considered this book Bellow's 20th Century version of Mark Twain's 19th Century THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN.  Augie March has also consistently reminded me of Tom Jones (the Fielding character, not the Welsh singer).  Bellow's novel follows the picaresque adventures of a young man searching for a worthwhile fate.  His adventures are believable, honest, and often hilarious.  THE ADVENTRUES OF AUGIE MARCH is a landmark of 20th Century American literature.	2001-09-11

He vanished from the mystery world, yet now, over a decade after vanishing, he has returned with his North Carolina-based series starring police officers Cuddy Mangum and Justin Savile.  FIRST LADY is as well written as his previous novels.  It is thoroughly contemporary--a bit hardboiled and noirish with violence and sex.  There is political corruption, odd characters, official manipulation, and sensational crimes.  Our protagonists are flawed characters though good men.  Cuddy and Justin are searching for a serial killer known in the media as Guess Who.  Malone's plot is well-paced.  His story seems believable.  FIRST LADY is a fine work--well worth the long wait.	2001-09-11

In her latest novel, IN A STRANGE CITY, Ms. Lippman plants her protagonist, Tess Monaghan, in the middle of a contemporary mystery story that is a pure tribute to Poe.  A murder occurs during the observance of Poe's birthday at the great author's tomb when two cloaked Visitors show up with roses and cognac to serve as the Poe Toaster.  A shot is fired.  One toaster dies.  The other flees.  Tess witnesses the homicide and soon finds herself involved in other Poe-esque plot elements.  The story includes multiple murders, a woman buried alive, and still unanswered questions involving Poe's life.  As usual, Lippman's writing is first-rate and her beloved Baltimore is rendered perfectly.  IN A STRANGE CITY is Lippman's best book yet.  Read it.  You won't be disappointed.	2001-09-11

I've read it several times since then, and I grow more impressed with the novel each time I read through it.

It tells the tale of a troubled family--the competing egos, ambitions, delusions, and escapes of the varied family members.  It is largely based on O'Neill's family.

Mr. Molotsky, a semi-retired newspaperman, spins a wonderful tale about the history of our national anthem.  This book is light.  It is a popular history.  It is amusing, yet it is most enlightening.  Mr. Molotsky presents a history of the War of 1812, which led directly to Francis Scott Key's composing of the poem that became the song.  He discusses the American invasion of Canada (yes, we did invade Canada) and the burning of Toronto (then York) that led to the British infamous torching of Washington (I bet that was in your history books).  He also paints a portrait of Francis Scott Key (a distant relative of F. Scott Fitzgerald whose masterpiece THE GREAT GATSBY was briefly called UNDER THE RED, WHITE, &amp; BLUE--which I used for the title of this review) who reluctantly joined the militia during the war.  Mr. Molotsky additionally explains the compostion of the poem, its linkage to a British drinking song, and its evolution into the national anthem with the final two words &quot;Play Ball!&quot;  THE FLAG, THE POET, &amp; THE SONG is a informative book.  It is well-written.  I recommend it highly.	2001-09-10

In fact, we shared the same table at the awards banquet at the last Bouchercon and then had drinks together afterward.  After coming clean with my bias, I still freely admit that SIMPLE JUSTICE is one of the finest mysteries published in recent years.  Mr. Wilson takes a flawed character, Benjamin Justice, a reporter who slipped up a bit on journalism's ethical standards and hence blew a Pulitzer Prize, and gives Justice a chance to begin to reclaim his life and his reputation.

While the plot requires a major suspension of belief--that any publisher would search out the author of a slush pile partial manuscript who had only signed the work with initials--this thriller reads well.  Maris Matherly-Reed is the editor who is so taken by a novel's prologue that she hunts down the initials-only author.

The text itself is a great read, and when it is properly staged, the play is spectacular.  For those of you not familiar with THE MOUSETRAP, the plot involves a classic cozy murder mystery--perhaps the classic cozy murder mystery.  The characters are well-drawn, and my wife even verbally gasped when she first saw the play's final plot twist.  Great work.  I hope it survives forever.	2001-09-08

At the funeral of a murdered friend, three women are reunited.  As a foursome, these women, then girls, grew up in working class Philadelphia during the 1950's and formed their own drill team that they named The Justus Girls.  They were best friends then, and they promised to always be there for one another.  As time passed, they grew apart.  Together, the quartet experienced most of the diverse elements that impacted America in general and African-American women in particular over the next few decades.  Through flashbacks and memories, Lambright allows the reader to experience the women's experiences.  While they band together at the funeral to discover what actually happened to their murdered friend, they discover much much more.  The reader does too.  I recommend this book highly.	2001-09-07

(Modern Library College Editions)	Books	5	12	21	N	N	Tell Us About The South, Mr. Faulkner	A California author with my debut novel in its initial release, I have always been facinated by ABSALOM, ABSALOM!  I realize I'm an easy mark for this book.  My Southern roots run deep, though my mother's side of the family.  She grew up in a small town in Alabama, and I've always read Faulkner, to some degree, to gain insights into my late mother's life experiences and background.  I believe ABSALOM, ABSALOM! is William Faulkner's strongest work, but there are many works that one could claim is his strongest.  He is the greatest American writer of all time.  ABSALOM, ABSALOM!, on one level, deals with the story of Thomas Sutpen and his attempt to build a dynasty on Sutpen's Hundred.  Sutpen was born poor,and he dreams of greatness.  He establishes a plantation.  He desires sons to carry on his legacy, yet his sons impact his life in unexpectedly tragic ways.  On another level, Faulkner deals with the issues of race, exploitation, and slavery.  Sutpen's first wife has black blood.  His son by this woman, hence, has black blood.  Sutpen repudiates both and that repudiation comes back to haunt him.  On a completely different level, Faulkner deals with Quentin Compson, a grandson of one Sutpen's friends, who uses this story to reconcile himself to his past, his life, and his history while he is a student at Harvard.  And ABSALOM, ABSALOM! keeps growing deeper and deeper with significance on top of significance atop significance.  Better books have been written in human history--perhaps three or four.	2001-09-07

Upon release, the critics hated it.  Everyone else loved it.  Most of those who loved it, bought it.  I remember reading it in high school to impress a certain longhaired blonde.  She wanted to go East to college because that was where Jenny went.  I would have accepted Harvard, had Harvard had the wisdom to accept me, yet I ended up in Claremont.  LOVE STORY tells a simple story of undergraduate love.  Oliver's a rich jock.  Jenny is a musician on scholarship.  Oliver's relationship with his familty is strained.  Jenny is close to her father.  We all know what happens to Jenny, yet the book endures better than the tear-jerker movie.  While the film is perhaps a victim of the fashions of its time, Eric Segal's language remains contemporary.  LOVE STORY still works.  I recommend it highly.	2001-09-07

FALSE CONCEPTION is one of my favorites.  In this book, Tanner finds himself entangled in a case involving surrogate parenthood.  A wealthy couple, unable to have children in the traditional manner, decide to take the surrogate route.  Their surrogate mother, who seemed to have checked out solidly in advance, disappears early in her pregnancy.  Tanner finds himself searching for the missing woman and uncovering secrets about everyone involved in the situation.  FALSE CONCEPTION is a well-plotted topical book with vividly drawn characters.  I recommend it highly.	2001-09-07

THE BOURNE IDENTITY is one of Mr. Ludlum's best.  The plot begins when a man, shot and left for dead, is rescued from the sea.  He has no memory, yet he attempts to discover his past.  He learns he is a trained killer and killers are now hunting for him.  They'd like to see him dead.  The plot spins on from there, and the plot is one of Mr. Ludlum's best.  There's some romance.  There's some danger.  There's some action.  There's some adventure.  THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a terrific novel.  I recommend it highly.	2001-09-06

It is well known that Hooker had a most difficult time finding a publisher for the original book.  The manuscript went through numerous revisions, found a home in a publishing house, and became a key part of American folklore.  This book provides the original version of Hawkeye, Trapper John, Hot Lips, Radar, and most of the rest of the gang.  There is more of Maine in these characters here than there is of Hollywood or Manhattan.  Hooker's version is less political than the movie and far less socially correct than the latter years of the television series.  While I personally prefer those golden latter years of the TV series, I still find this novel extremely enjoyable.  Without this book, the great film and historic series would have never existed.  American popular culture would much poorer if that were so.	2001-09-06

Ed McBain, the celebrated mystery writer, was a teacher back when he wrote this book.  Evan Hunter is, as we all know, Ed McBain's actual name.  I suspect he based his Richard Dadier character on his own experiences.  Dadier is an idealistic young man with his first professional job as an English teacher in a working class high school.  Dadier does his best to reach his students, yet the challenges are great.  This book is a classic, and it still applies to teaching these days.  I truly wish Evan Hunter would return to THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE.  America needs its best and its brightest in our classrooms.  As I can attest to from my experience, one can teach students and write mysteries without sacrificing either career.	2001-09-06

As a mystery author with my debut novel in its initial release, I have been waiting quite awhile for Susan Isaacs to write another mystery featuring Long Islander Judith Singer.  It's been twenty years since Judith's last appearance in COMPROMISING POSITIONS, and LONG TIME NO SEE is well worth the wait.  Much has changed in Judith's life since she solved that dentist's murder.  She's raised two kids, become a widow when her husband died as a marathon man, and earned a Ph.D.  While she's teaching college, she remains essentially unfulfilled.  Then former investment banker and current Long Island housewife Courtney Logan is murdered.  Courtney, everyone's idea of a perfect soccer mom, turns out to have had some secrets.  Her husband, Greg, is connected to the mob through his father.  When Phil Lowenstein, the late Courtney's father-in-law, offers to hire Judith to investigate the death, Judith is more than ready, despite a warning from the police detective who is her former lover, to take on the case.  Judith launches her investigation, and Ms. Isaacs spins a fine tale.  It is an enjoyable read, and I can barely wait another twenty years for the next Susan Isaacs mystery featuring Judith Singer.	2001-09-06

William of Baskerville is sent to a monastery during the 14th century to investigate the death of a monk.  While he is investigating that death, several other deaths occur.  Before you know it, you are reading one of the best mysteries written in the last quarter-century.  Eco captures the time and the place of his story perfectly.  He knows his history.  He knows the church of his chosen era.  His characters are perfectly rendered.  He knows his people.  His plot is magnificent.  He knows how to tell a story.  THE NAME OF THE ROSE is a mystery like few others.  Excellent beyond belief.	2001-09-05

If his book was fiction, it would be classified as gritty noir.  It is, unfortunately, nonfiction.  Mr. Pron, a dedicated true crime reporter, presents the facts about Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo's horrible crime spee.  In LETHAL MARRIAGE, Mr. Pron pulls no punches.  He even provides pictures.  He tells the tale of these two unquestionably sick individuals as they victimize people unfortunate enough to become their victims.

The novel deals with Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus investigating a complicated series of crimes.  There are no easy answers here.  Computer fraud may be involved. Adolescent angst may play a part.  The aftermath of the Holocaust could be another contributing factor.

I am glad she has resumed writing them, especially TOTAL RECALL.  In many ways, TOTAL RECALL is Lotty Herschel's book.  Lotty is V.I.'s friend and mentor.  Lotty is the closest thing to a mother V.I. has.  In several chapters, Lotty takes central stage and returns us to those horrible days of Holocaust.  In time present, a man named Paul Radbuka has surfaced making startling claims regarding his conection to Lotty and her companion, Max.  V.I. begins to investigate this man and his claims at the same time she is involved with an insurance investigation involving a black man named Aaron Sommers.  As the story progresses, the reader learns much about Lotty, her past, and the horrors of Nazism.  Ms. Paretsky also links Holocaust reparations to the issue of reparations for slavery.  TOTAL RECALL is an excellent novel addressing some most serious themes.  Excellent book.	2001-09-05

As Dad always put it, he served in the army with Doug MacArthur.  Growing up and hearing tales spun by my friends' fathers who fought their war in Europe, I always felt a bit uncomfortable because my Dad merely jumped from island to island in the South Pacific with the army air corps.  The story Hampton Sides tells in GHOST SOLDIERS is one of the stories I grew up with.  Dad and his war buddies from the Pacific Theater would recount this story as if they actually participated in this celebrated mission.  They didn't, but I'm glad I sat around and listened.  Sides brings back some memories with this book.  It reads well, and it captures the mood of the times perfectly.  It tells the story of America's daring rescue of POWs in the Philippines.

As one would expect, there is a humorous edge to this story.  Judith Singer is a Long Island housewife who becomes obsessed with solving the murder of a local man about teeth--I mean town.  He was murdered after having bedded half the women Judith knows and propositioning the other half.  Her husband discourages her investigation, but she pursues it any way.

David Halberstam's OCTOBER 1964 is one such book.  I loved this book despite the fact that my taste in baseball teams swings most often to the likes of the Red Sox, the Cubs, and the Angels.  While my personal teams figure out new ways every season not to bring home a World Series crown, the Yankees and the Cardinals of 1964 represent two of the great championship teams in baseball history.  Each, also, repesents much more than merely a team or a city.  In Mr. Halberstam's book, the Yankees represent the Establishment.  They are used to winning.  They are securely implanted in America's moneyed and white power structure.  It is expected that they will win because they have won so often in the past.  The Cardinals represent change.  The stars of the Cards are black--Gibson, Brock, and Flood.  They are the rebels.  Later in his life, Curt Flood became the man who challenged the baseball's reserve clause in court.  Flood lost his case and his career, but he revolutionized the game.  David Halberstam, one of journalism's best and brightest, brilliantly weaves the history of these two very different sports teams into the time period in which they faced off against each other in the battle for the championship of the world.  OCTOBER 1964 is a great book.  We know in 1964 that the establishment was still hanging on securely in power but that the rebels were gaining strength fast.  Yet we do know which team won the World Series.  You can look it up.	2001-09-02

Ms. Grafton was the event's keynote speaker.  I was one of a couple of dozen other author-presenters.  Sue Grafton is the reigning queen of American mystery fiction, and G IS FOR GRAFTON proves that point conclusively.  In this book, Natalie Hevener Kaufman &amp; Carol McGinnis Kay have written a biography of Ms. Grafton's lead character, Kinsey Millhone.  Kaufman and Kay had Ms. Grafton's cooperation in preparing this work, and they have done a terrific job.  Everything you ever wanted to know about Kinsey but didn't know enough to ask, is covered here.  Kaufman and Kay have achieved a remarkable accomplishment.  This book is must read for any serious Grafton fan or informed reader of the mystery genre.  I especially enjoyed the &quot;photographic record&quot; of Kinsey's life, including snapshots of her home, her offices, her car, her jogging path, and several other scenes from Santa Teresa.  G IS FOR GRAFTON is a great book.	2001-08-31

While I am a mystery writer, I almost always cite J.R.R. Tolkien as an important early influence.  I remember being in the eighth grade, reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS along with a group of close friends.  These were fascinating books then, and they remain so today.  In high school, a familiarity with THE HOBBIT really impressed a certain young lady I had grown interested in.  These books are wonderfully written stories with strong ethical codes embedded within them.  I still find myself occasionally re-reading them, and my teenaged children have all found copies of this set given to them for special occasions.  You can't make a mistake in reading Tolkien.	2001-08-31

While taking a break between my first book (now in current release and recently sold to a Japanese publisher for translation/publication) and my second book (now in preproduction), I read Tom Nolan's ROSS MACDONALD.  Ross Macdonald is perhaps the mystery writer who has had the strongest influence upon my writing, and I spent approximately a month closely reading this overwhelming book.  Mr. Nolan spent the better part of two decades researching this bigraphy, and his dedicated efforts clearly show in this work.  Nolan traces Macdonald's early life, his education, his military career, his sometimes stormy relationship with his wife Margaret Millar, his years of work at mastering his craft, his family troubles, his eventual fame, his societal and political interests, his dedication to certain causes, and the tragically early end to his life.  In short, this book tells you everything you ever wanted to know about Macdonald but didn't know enough to ask.  While reading this book, I made mental notes of a some minor details I desired further elaboration on.  Fortunately, several months later, I found myself seated next to Tom Nolan at the LA TIMES Festival of Books.  It was a pleasure to meet such a kind and generous man.  Mr. Nolan is as fine a gentleman as he is a writer, and he had answers to all the questions I still had about the great author we both admire.  ROSS MACDONALD is an extraordinarily well-researched work written by a man with a thorough mastery of his material.  I have never read a better literary biography.	2001-08-31

I doubt if I'll be writing my series in a half a century, but I'm glad McBain is still writing his.  Astonishingly, each 87th Precinct novel seems fresh and inventive.  MONEY, MONEY, MONEY is no exception.  Steve Carella and the boys (as well as the girls) remain as vibrant as they did when this series first began back when Eisenhower was president.  In this fifty-first 87th Precint novel, a woman is found dead in the Grover Park Zoo.  She turns out to be an ex-military flygirl who has found herself a fulfilling civilian career as a drug pilot.  Steve and his associates (mainly Fat Ollie Weeks) follow the money, and McBain's plot spins upward from there.  There's a secondary plot involving a terrorist plot, and, of course, the personal problems and concerns of the series characters also play a major part in the story.  MONEY, MONEY, MONEY is a fine fifty-first entry in this series.  It is one of the best fifty-first novels in any mystery series ever written.  Get this book and read it.	2001-08-31

MIAMI TWILIGHT is Tom Coffey's second suspense novel. It tells the tale of Garrett Doherty, a public relations man. Garrett is a good man who tries to be a good man. He is married to a fine woman, and he is dedicated to his work. He is a company man, as some good PR men are, and at a business party, a seemingly casual conversation leads to a series of tragic events in a number of different lives. Coffey populates this work with realistically drawn characters, and his plot is swiftly paced taking several unexpected turns. His writing is flawless. MIAMI TWILIGHT is an excellent book.	2001-08-30

G. Bruce Knecht's THE PROVING GROUND tells one of the most exciting sea stories of recent years. Knecht's book, nonfiction, provides an up close and personal report of the disastrous Sidney to Hobart Yacht Race in 1998. Knecht examines the obsession of many of the competitors and tells of one the most tragic competitions in modern sporting history. Over one hundred yachts sailed from Sidney, yet less than half that number reached Hobart. Six sailors lost their lives, and dozens of others needed rescued from the sea. Adverse weather caused the disaster, and Knecht tells this whale of a tale of eighty-foot waves wiping out numerous competitive crafts. Knecht also presents the pressures of competition, the drive of several crews, and the reactions of many individuals to various forms of stress. This book is an excellent one.

ALL THE DEAD WERE STRANGERS is a solid thriller. Ethan Black's third novel (following THE BROKEN HEARTS CLUB and IRRESISTIBLE)deals with terrorism, the government's attempts to battle it, and a top-notch mystery story. Black's Conrad Voort, an NYPD detective, is passed a list of people around the country with connections to terrorism. Some are dead, perhaps murdered. Others include Dr. Jill Towne, with whom Voort becomes taken, and Frank Greene, who is hoping to blow up a nice chunk of New York City. A shadowy Saudi businessman/terrorist, Abu Bin Hussein, also plays a part in this story, as do numerous government operatives. Black has a well-plotted--topical and timely--story. His characters are well-drawn, and his writing is excellent. ALL THE DEAD WERE STRANGERS is an excellent suspense novel.	2001-08-30

David McCullough achieves this goal brilliantly in JOHN ADAMS. McCullough's book is thoroughly researched, insightful, and finely written. It is also perfect for today. After all, John Adams was the first president from New England who became the father of a future president. JOHN ADAMS presents a John Adams who was not eager for a political life yet accepted the obligations that came with his time. His accomplishments are well known. He defended in court the unfortunate British troops who suppressed a Boston street riot that has gone down in history as the Boston Massacre. He became a leader in the revolutionary movement for freedom from Britain, though to some degree a number two player to a number of other more prominent individuals. He was one of the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence, though he was clearly a number two to Jefferson. He became a diplomat and the first vice president--another number two. He served as the second president of the United States. In 1800, upon his electoral defeat, he created the key American political precedent of a peaceful transfer of power. John Admas may have been destined in life to play a number two part in many key events in U.S. history, but McCullough's JOHN ADAMS was a number-one quality individual. I recommend this book highly.	2001-08-25

This mystery is a thoroughly enjoyable novel. It involves the world of illusion in an age when illusion was taken quite seriously indeed. Carter performs a magic trick involving President Warren Harding merely hours before that president dies. To certain government agents, Carter becomes a suspect in Harding's odd death. Again, this novel is a fun read. The characters are well-drawn. The world of magic and magicians is convincingly rendered. The plot is swiftly-paced, and it takes some unusual twists. Gold's writing is wonderful. I recommend this book highly.	2001-08-25

Robert Massie has achieved this basic literary goal masterfully in PETER THE GREAT. In this well-researched and informative volume, Massie tells the tale of Peter the Great, his country, European culture, and his historical era. Massie presents Peter in human terms with characteristics that are often contradictory. On a much more important level, this book presents Massie's view of one of the key eras in Russian history. Peter's era provides many crucial elements of the cultural underpinnings of one of the mightiest nations in the modern world--cultural underpinnings that must be understood by every thoughtful and informed individual.	2001-08-25

The literary selections he has included in THE BOOK OF VIRTUES aim to provides examples of traditional values--values such as friendship, courage, and compassion.

Reading Ambrose's take on George McGovern and his heroic air crew, I now understand my father's dedication to that man's presidential campaign.

Mr. Enger's novel is a tale of genuine family values and the overwhelming power of faith.  Reuben is an asthmatic boy who would not be alive if his father had not, in the name of God, commanded him to breathe as a newborn.  Jeremiah Land is the simple though faithful man who performed that miracle and who his son Reuben believes is capable of anything.  When Reuben's brother Davy kills two attackers who were threatening the Land family, he is charged with murder.  Some people see him as a hero.  Others view him as a cold-blooded murderer.  On the day of his trial, Davy escapes.  With the FBI in pursuit, Jeremiah loads his family in  their Airstream to find his son first.  What follows is an amazingly plotted novel, packed full of references to literary works and American legends, and an inspirational tale of the power faith can have in people's lives.  Fabulous read!	2001-08-23

Clive Cussler's sixteenth Pitt adventure, VALHALLA RISING, involves the sinking of the world's most celebrated new cruise ship.   Dirk rescues the most of the passengers, but the inventor of the ship's revolutionary engines drowns.  Our hero saves Dr. Egan's beautiful daughter Kelly, and soon Dirk and Al Giordino are attempting to foil a plot to corner the world's oil supply.  By the way, Dirk also finds time to save Kelly from a second brush with death, discover the remains of an early submarine, and prove the Vikings landed on the Hudson.  VALHALLA RISING is a fun read, though I used to buy my son the latest Cussler to read on cruise ships.  I doubt if I will with this one.  I'll let him read VALHALLA RISING on dry land.	2001-08-23

Her creation, Sharon McCone, revolutionized modern mystery fiction.  McCone broke the old stereotypes.  She became the first human private eye.  She is also the oldest sister of all those women private eyes practicing today.  MCCONE AND FRIENDS is a short story collection with an unusual twist.  Ms. Muller provides unique perspectives on McCone by allowing her supporting charaters to tell some of the stories in this collection.

Bragg's book is a biography of his maternal grandmother--a man he never knew yet grew to love through his research.  My fascination with Bragg's book began on largely personal terms.  Bragg's story of his grandfather could have easily been a story about my grandfather.  Charlie Bundrum was born early in the last century and lived a hardscrabble life in the South.  My maternal grandfather was born at about the same time and lived his entire life in Alabama.  Charlie fought the good fight, and he struggled valiantly against poverty.  He never got too far from it, but he did the best he could.  Married at 17, he supported his family and planted the roots from which future generations grew.  Charlie died young--at age fifty.  My grandfather died in his thirties.  Both men were survived by remarkable Southern women.  Charlie's daughter gave birth to Rick Bragg.  My grandfather's depression-era orphaned daughter gave birth to me.  Once I read AVA'S MAN, I acquired a knowledge of what my mother's life in her youth was possibly like, and I began to understand her lifelong reluctance to discuss it in detail with any of her California children.	2001-08-22

I especially enjoy using his chapter on corporate criminals where I get a chance to point directly at students (who are wise enough by then to know they are supposed to agree with their instrcutor's positions which are routinely in sympathy with Mr. Moore's) who are using products produced by these &quot;criminals.&quot;  Mr. Moore's ravings about NAFTA may be growing old in some parts of this nation, but not at my school--rural and Latino--that is less than a mile from one of the &quot;NAFTA HIGHWAYS.&quot;  I treasure the memory of the day when a state senator came to speak to my class and found himself peppered with questions drawn from material in this book.  I recommend DOWNSIZE THIS! highly, as I do Michael Moore's films ROGER AND ME, CANADIAN BACON, and THE BIG ONE as well as the video sets of episodes originally produced for his two television shows.  I only wish he'd collect more of TV NATION onto video.

I've been reading her books for years.  We live in the same general vicinity, and we've met occasionally on the mystery convention circuit.  Ms. Fowler's books are uniformly well-written, and MARINER'S COMPASS has an unusual twist.  While the quilting angle is still here, Benni Harper, Ms. Fowler's former cowgirl sleuth, finds herself confronted with an unusual mystery.  She inherits a house and all the earthly possessions of a man she has never met, provided she meets the odd condition he has set forth.  She must live in the house for two weeks.  Upon her taking up residency in the house, she finds herself forced to unravel a mystery.  She discovers that while she never knew Jacob Chandler, Chandler knew her frighteningly well.  While Ms. Fowler's main story is fresh and innovative, MARINER'S COMPASS continues developing her excellent series.

The story centers on a successful businessman Jack Vermillion who has a son prison.  He wants to help his son as much as he can, and he attempts to cut a deal with some law enforcement figures he shouldn't have trusted.  He helps to set up a Federal bust of a client named Earl Pike for gunrunning, yet the attempted arrest results in Federal agents getting killed by a sniper.  Vermillon, not Pike, finds himself charged in the shooting because a prosecutor wants to make his rep bringing down Vermillion and confiscating everything he owns under asset forfeiture laws.  As Vermillion struggles with that situation, Casey Spandau, a police detective is attempting to uncover evidence in a frustratingly difficult to solve homicide case.  Earl Pike is her prime suspect.  Plot lines converge, and the good guys learn the importance of questioning authority. Stroud has written a fabulous thriller here with BLACK WATER TRANSIT.	2001-08-20

Sharon McCone is certainly her most famous lead.  There are also some books with Elena Olivarez or Joanna Stark in the lead.  Each series has its own tone and subject matter, perfectly appropriate for each series.  In POINT DECEPTION, Marcia Muller has either written a magnificent stand-alone thriller or a solid debut of a new mystery series.  POINT DECEPTION is basically a police procedural starring Deputy Sheriff Rhoda Swift.  She is haunted by a mass murder dating from the start of her career and as the anniversary of that murder rolls around a New York writer named Guy Newberry shows up to write about the unsolved homicides.  More deaths occur in time present, and Rho wants to solve all of the crimes.  Rho Swift is a complex character.  She carries this book, and she could carry a series.  The plot is complicated yet believable, and Ms. Muller's writing is up to its usual highest standards.  We have a terrific book here.	2001-08-20

STEPPIN' ON A RAINBOW is no exception.  I'm not Nixoning you.  Kinky's new adventure involves the disappearance of Village Irregular Mike McGovern.  McGovern was in Hawaii to work on a book, and he disappears as he is strolling down a beach.  While at first Kinky finds better things to do than worry about his missing McGovern, it is not long before everyone's favorite Texan-New Yorker/country-and-western performer/mystery author/sleuth assembles the rest of his Irregulars for a Hawaiian romp.  This Kinky outing has everything the experienced reader expects in a fresh Kinky.  It is well written with sharp humor lying over a basic humanity.

On the same Sunday that Ms. Woods organized a Mystery Writers of America function honoring Anthony Boucher, STORMY WEATHER received TWO SEPARATE HIGHLY POSITIVE reviews in the LA TIMES.  This follow-up to the critically acclaimed INNER CITY BLUES concerns the death of a pioneering African-American filmmaker.  The novel deals with serious racial issues within the Los Angeles film community and within the LAPD.  It additionally deals with the hardships any woman detective must endure to pursue a career with the LAPD.  In STORMY WEATHER, Ms. Woods continues to develop her Charlotte Justice character.  Detective Justice continues dealing with past issues such as the deaths of her husband and child.  Charlotte is also struggling to continue building a relationship with her doctor boyfriend.  In STORMY WEATHER, Paula Woods attempts to tell a complex story on several distinct levels.  From this author's perspective, Ms. Woods is entirely successful.	2001-08-20

I graduated from Claremont McKenna College at a time when the Straussians were battling for their intellectual position that great thinkers must be understood as they understood themselves.  They argued for absolute standards and the importance of great truths in the traditions of Western Civilization.  Allan Bloom, Saul Bellow's good friend and fellow scholar at the University of Chicago, served as the basis for the novel's central character, Abe Ravelstein.  Bloom was one of the leaders of the Straussian Movement, and Claremont McKenna College was where the Straussians held their California foothold.  We were all required to read Bloom's books and hear him speak every time he was in town.  I am fascinated how this purely intellectual figure has been transformed by his pal Saul Bellow into the complex fictional character who is the title character of this novel.  This book is fascinating to me for largely personal reasons dealing with my undergraduate education.  It is also a fine novel, one of the best Bellow has written in recent years.  I am amazed at the huge popularity of this book among the general public.  I doubt if any contemporary author other than America's greatest living literary giant, Saul Bellow, could have accomplished such an achievement.	2001-08-19

Freedman's tale of Fritz Tullis.  Fritz is a man who was born on third base and who is in danger of getting picked off before he scores.  His roots are as establishment as they can get.  His mother is a Maryland patrician, and he was, until he had an affair with the wrong woman, a respected history professor at the University of Texas.  After losing his job, he returns to his family's Maryland estate, drinks too much, chases convenient skirts, and takes up birdwatching.  He becomes fascinated with a whooping crane.  One hungover morning, as he is searching for his favorite member of that endangered feathered species, he witnesses a murder on a neighboring airstrip.  It turns out the airstrip is owned by an undersecretary of state with a checkered past.  The victim turns out to be a Russian diplomat.  Fritz decides something has to be done, and he finds his efforts assisted by a beautiful Harvard academic with a famous film star's name yet her own deep secrets.  BIRD'S-EYE VIEW is an enjoyable read on many levels.  I recommend it highly.	2001-08-18

I teach high-risk students in one of the most impoverished schools in the United States, not in the United Kingdom.  I am an author--my debut mystery is in its initial release.  With those disclaimers in place, I want to clearly state my unequivocal admiration for TO SIR, WITH LOVE.  It is a must-read book for any teacher worth her classroom.  It tells the tale of Mr. Braithwaite and his struggles to teach poor teenagers on the verge of adulthood in one of the poorest neighborhoods of London.  His story rings true.  Being a non-Latino teaching Latino students, I understand the racial tensions in the story.  The difficulties in getting students to focus on goals more distant in the future than the upcoming weekend are also painfully true.  The need for creative and heartfelt approaches to these educational challenges is additionally made clear.  And, of course, the inspirational tone of the book is exactly what is needed in this day and age.  TO SIR, WITH LOVE should be more widely read than it already is, and I hope every teacher has similar inspirational tales to tell, as does E.R.Braithwaite and this reviewer.	2001-08-18

While it was once said that Mr. Kerouac's work was not writing--it was typing--that statement does not give ON THE ROAD and Mr. Kerouac fair shakes.  This book and his works defined the Beat Movement.  They captured a sense of an entire generation.  They have had a major impact on American letters and intellectual thought.

This anthology features big name authors such as Lawrence Block, Robert B. Parker, Michael Connelly, and Thomas Perry.  The collection covers the subject of baseball from a variety perspectives ranging from Little League to the Majors and from benchwarming little boys and baseball parents to historic superstars and sports agents.  Highlights include &quot;Harlem Nocturne&quot; by Robert Parker, a story featuring some fellows named Rickey and Robinson and &quot;Pick-Off Play&quot; by Troy Soos starring his series character baseball journeyman/everyman Mickey Rawlings.  I recommend MURDERERS' ROW for any mystery reader interested in baseball (as all good people are).	2001-08-18

In my seldom humble opinion, I consider it superior to the Robert Redford movie, though I loved the film.  The novel is darker than the motion picture.  The book ends differently than the movie.  In THE NATURAL, Mr. Malamud creates a modern American myth with suggestions of links to the Arthurian Legend.  Hobbs, the eventual star of the New York Knights, is the flawed hero born with the potential to be the greatest who ever was.  This story tells the tale of his hardships, his heroic accomplishments, and his larger-than-life failures.  I loved the way Malamud mixed actual baseball lore in with the invented events of his story, but I don't want to give away too many more specifics in the fear of ruining the novel for people who haven't yet read it.

I love the way Ms. D'Amato effectively works the criminal use of the Internet into this police procedural.  Danni Gaston, a young daughter of two celebrities--an entertainer and a politician--is abducted from a church.  The snatched child appears on the Internet a matter of hours later, and the kidnappers demand the release of a web-terrorist.  Police detective Polly Kelly is given the task of solving the crime and finding the child.  Kelly finds herself pressured by a camera webcasting Danni's every move as well as the child's deteriorating condition.  Ms. D'Amato has written a fine book with a realsitic setting, a highly contemporary plot, and realistically drawn characters.  It is a fine read.	2001-08-13

In DESPERATE MEASURES, Barbara Holloway finds herself at first in opposition to her father, Frank.  Gus Marchand is murdered, and there are two suspects.  Frank's client dies mysteriously, yet Frank does not want the blame for the Marchand homicide to be placed on his client.  Barbara's client, for awhile, remains nameless.  She is highly protective of the man who turns out to be Alex Feldman, a horribly disfigured man who had been previously accused of stalking the murdered man's teenaged daughter.  The plot grows complicated, and Alex is obviously carrying secrets.  Shelley, an associate of Barbara's, sees beyond Alex's disfigurement and into his heart.  Yet the murder must still be solved.  Great book.  One of Wilhelm's best.	2001-08-13

His B&amp;B needs constant maintenance and many more guests.  He does have a lovely maid named Elise, but unfortunately, a one of his few paying customers ends up murdered at the top of the lighthouse.  As the experienced reader expects, the police can't get their act together so Alex and Elise launch their own investigation.  Guess who solves the crime?

Kris Nelscott has set her novel in Memphis in the days surrounding the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.  She takes this factual historical mystery and superimposes her own fictional historical mystery on top of it.  A intriguing technique in itself, but she doesn't stop there.  She introduces a strong potential series lead in Smokey Dalton.  In this book, a wealthy woman named Laura Hathaway wants to learn why her mother left Dalton some cash in her will.  Dalton realizes this gift is the second significant contribution to him from the Hathaway family.  Previously, an attorney delivered him a check from the Hathaways but refused to tell him why.  Soon, Mr. Dalton and Ms. Hathaway join forces and launch their joint investigation against the backdrop of a city divided along racial grounds in one of the most chaotic eras of recent American history.

They first must apprehend some satanic child-killers and then attempt to help Savich's possibly suicidal sister, Lily.  Lily has her share of problems, including a deceased child, a husband whose nothing but trouble and a handful of art forgeries, but she also finds romance with an art broker named Simon Russo.  Lots of action.  Great characters.  A twisting and turning plot.  Catherine Coulter has written a masterful book here, as she nears her fiftieth novel.

Alaska is a grand land (I was recently there to appear at Anchorage's LEFT COAST CRIME mystery convention) and Ms. Simpson makes the most of her setting.  Liza Romero captains a freighter that services the islands south of the state capital.  Along this stretch of water, strange events begin to happen.  Among these strange events, healthy whales are beaching themselves.  The wildlife expert, Henry Sizemore, who investigates the cause of the beached whales apparently drowns in an accident.  So launches Liza Romero's second mystery.  Liza remains a strong character in this new novel.  Newcomer, Scott Beringer also proves interestingly conflicted.  The most fascinating elements of SOUND TRACKS, though, are the ecological underpinnings of this story.  SOUND TRACKS is a terrific follow-up to Ms. Simpson's stunning debut, CROW IN STOLEN COLORS.	2001-08-12

In my opinion, Ford's INDEPENDENCE DAY is the finest American novel of the nineties.  In this work, Ford brings back his everyman, Frank Bascombe.  As with Updike's Rabbit in RABBIT IS RICH, Frank has acquired wealth.  He has quit sportswriting, and he is currently peddling real estate.  Of course, his ex-wife is now married to a richer man, and Frank is still struggling to cope with his contemporary life.  His friends, his lover, his business associates all play their parts in his life.  As the holiday weekend approaches, Frank plans a trip with his son to the Hall of Fame, in the hope of helping his troubled boy straighten out.  Events intervene, and Frank again finds himself fighting to cope with his role in this world.  INDEPENDENCE DAY is Richard Ford's masterpiece.	2001-08-12

ALWAYS A RECKONING is a book that I keep on my desk in my classroom.  These poems are heartfelt and they reveal much about this humble man and his life in the South as the South began to change.  I will often read selected works from this book when we cover the electoral process and civil rights.  These poems are honest and well-written.

All of his collections are excellent.  WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOVE is among his best.  Carver can pour more felt life into a few thousand words than most of us other writers can do in tens of thousands of words.  These stories--some odd, some simple, all minimalist--showcase Carver's talent as well as those in any other collection.  If I could have ever learned to write short stories as powerful as Carver's, I likely would have never begun my successful career as a novelist.	2001-08-12

He is middle-aged with a fractured family.  He has an ex-wife.  He has a roommate, of sorts.  He has some acquaintances he finds convenient to call friends. He has a girlfriend who works as a nurse.  Frank has given up his youthful aspirations to be a serious novelist.  He now works as a sportswriter.  He's a sportswriter in the same way Willie Loman is a salesman. THE SPORTSWRITER is about contemporary American life, and Ford does a brilliant job with his material.  I recommend this book highly.	2001-08-12

I would've voted for him too, save for the fact that Fred Harris dropped out of the race long before the California primary.  He would've gotten my first ever vote (see, I'm not THAT ancient!), but now I get to vote strongly in favor of his first mystery novel. COYOTE REVENGE is set in Oklahoma during the Depression.  Times are tough for everyone, especially Hoyt and Inez Ready.  Someone shoots them and then burns down their home.  Two years later, the mystery is still unsolved when their son, Dub, dies under dubious circumstances.  Dub Ready was sheriff, and the sheriff's job then goes to Okie Dunn, a friend of Dub's who recently returned home after dropping out of law school.  Okie begins to investigate the deaths, and the investigation produces some interesting answers.  Fred Harris has written a terrific historical mystery here, and it captures its time and place perfectly.

The book opens with a disturbing scene from our contemporary promised land--talented people of diverse nationalities who have immigrated to America holding immigrants' dreams close to their hearts have been reduced to picking up trash along a California roadway.  HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG centers on Massound Amir Behrani.  He is a former high-ranking Iranian officer who left his homeland for political reasons.  He arrives in the United States, full of hopes.  He is willing to work hard to achieve his dreams yet he finds his expensively printed resumes and job interviews in well-trimmed French suits, produce no suitable opportunities.  He sinks most of his money into a high-priced apartment with elaborate furnishings in the hope that his daughter will find an acceptable match in marriage.  Once she marries, he buys a house at auction.  The house's previous owner, Kathy Nicolo, wants to desperately keep her home.  Problems arise.  Kathy and Behrani repeatedly conflict over this house.

During some free time, Tom suggested I take my daughter to the Sixth Floor Museum, a Dallas museum concerned with the JFK assassination, as is Mr. Sawyer's novel THE SIXTEENTH MAN.  My daughter and I enjoyed the museum, and I have since enjoyed Mr. Sawyer's novel.  It is a fascinating tale of two interlocking stories.  In 1963, PI Charlie Callan, while working a domestic surveillance case, finds his life endangered when he is linked to a certain murder-conspiracy.  In time present, sixteen male skeletons are discovered by researcher Matthew Packard.  Fifteen are ancient, more ancient than any human remains ever before found in North America.  The sixteenth is recent, and Packard finds himself suddenly plunged into a dangerous world of fast-paced action and life-threatening twists, surprisingly linked to the JFK assassination.

While I have never been any closer to Vietnam than Honolulu, GOING AFTER CACCIATO captures the insanity of America's Vietnam experience for me.  Good men fought the Vietnam War for what they thought were the correct values, and good people opposed the war because of what they thought were the correct values. Tim O'Brien brings these contradictory values to life in this work.  Cacciato deserts his jungle post in-country with the intention of walking over 8,000 miles of land to Paris to get those infamous peace talks moving forward.  The men of his squad pursue him, soon beyond the world of factual reality.  They go on a surreal journey across Asia, Middle East, and Europe, raising more questions than they answer.  GOING AFTER CACCIATO is Tim O'Brien's masterpiece, a landmark in contemporary American literature.	2001-08-10

I enjoyed CORELLI'S MANDOLIN upon its first release, and I am certain I will enjoy the upcoming motion picture.  In this novel, Louis de Bernieres has created a romance set against the backdrop of a horrific war.  Dr. Iannis practices medicine on a Greek island, and his daughter, Pelagia, is engaged to a young fisherman named Mandra.  World War II disrupts their ideal life.  The Italian's invade, and Captain Corelli arrives with his mandolin.  Mandra flees to join the partisans, and the good captain becomes romantically interested in Pelagia.  Complications arise.  This book has heart.  It is a fabulous read.  As Antonio Corelli in novel replies to &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot; by shouting &quot;Heil Puccini!&quot;, I have to add &quot;Heil De Bernieres!&quot;	2001-08-10

Richard Brautigan's suicide nearly two decades ago haunts American literature almost as darkly as Hemingway's does from four decades ago.  In AN UNFORTUNATE WOMAN, the reader can see where its author is heading.  I'm glad this book has finally found print, but I'm sad knowing full well how the life of one of my literary heroes will soon end.  Brautigan's final work tells, in journal form, of a man's journey following the hanging death of a friend.  In some ways, it's a typical, rambling, fun Brautigan book.  At certain points the man shines like he did at his best.  It's the Sixties and Seventies all over again.  At other points, sadness takes over, as one can see a magnificent talent fading.  AN UNFORTUNATE WOMAN is a book I'm glad I read, and I would freely recommend it to everyone.	2001-08-09

Jance's Joanna Brady novels.  In PARADISE LOST, Ms. Jance adds complications to her Arizona sheriff's life.  Joanna is adjusting to a new marriage, building a dream house, and dealing with a daughter who is growing up too fast.  During a Girl Scout campout, Joanna's daughter, Jenny, and one of the daughter's friends sneak off to sneak cigarettes.  They find a body.  Sheriff Brady starts investigating the murder, yet she is also concerned with her daughter's misbehavior.  Then the daughter's friend turns up dead, and Joanna worries that Jenny may be the next victim in the killer's sights.  Throw in a subplot involving Joanna's suspicions involving her new husband possibly having an affair, and you have a top-notch mystery here.  It may be titled PARADISE LOST but it is actually, for the reader, PARADISE FOUND.	2001-08-09

With SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS, Mr. Patterson not only stretches.  He writes a brilliant book.  The set-up is simple.  Katie Wilkinson, a book editor, finds herself dumped by Matt Harrison, a poet.  As a parting gift, Matt sends Katie a diary his first wife, Suzanne, kept for their son, Nicholas.  In this diary, Suzanne tells how she gave up an exhausting (and rewarding) career in urban medicine following a youthful heart attack.  Suzanne opens a family practice on Martha's Vineyard and finds happiness as well as love with a housepainter who develops into a famous poet named Matt.  Katie reads this diary and comes to a better understanding of many diverse elements in life.  SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS is a terrific book.  James Patterson knew exactly when to seek a change of pace.	2001-08-09

Stephen Crane's RED BADGE OF COURAGE was a standard part of my course's curriculum every year.  It is a classic, and it deserves to be one.  It tells the tale of The Youth who goes off to war imagining war to be a glorious encounter with nobility on all sides.  As he endures his first battle, he learns otherwise.  There has never been a better book written about the American Civil War, or was that war called (as my mother, an Alabama girl, referred to it) The War of Northern Aggression.	2001-08-09

DREAMING OF BABYLON is the perfect send-up of the mystery genre (in which I write serious books).  A CONFEDERATE GENERAL FROM BIG SUR captures the Sixties spirit as well as any other work of the time.  THE HAWKLINE MONSTER is a fabulously fun read--whatever a gothic western happens to be.  All these books are clever, playful, well-structured, and brilliantly done.  My only regret is that Richard Brautigan himself cut his career tragically short nearly two decades ago.  Take advantage of this collection to enjoy what we can still savor of the great writer's talent.	2001-08-09

While this is an epic work of fantasy and I am a mystery writer, I recall reading this book when it first came out.  When I saw it in reprint, I picked it up and read it again.  THE TALISMAN, opening near a silenced theme park involves the journey of a thirteen-year-old across America and into another realm attempting to save his dying mother.  The prize in crucial to Jack Sawyer, yet his journey is even more meaningful.  THE TALISMAN is a groundbreaking book, and I have never been able to tell which parts were written by which writer.  Steven King and Peter Straub are both brilliant here.  Magnificent all around!	2001-08-09

It is a collection of short stories with varied subject matter, diverse settings, and a variety of themes.  While one repeatedly hears about how the art of short story writing has died, books like RETRIBUTION prove such statements are false.  Short story writing is alive, well, and going strong.

The novel takes on advances in medical technology and mixes that topic with an odd assortment of characters.  A television reporter loses a hand on camera to a circus lion.

There is no debate involving Louisiana.  James Lee Burke is clearly the master, and I believe A MORNING FOR FLAMINGOS is Burke's strongest work.  Dave Robicheaux is left for dead during a prison escape, yet he doesn't die.  He ends up back on the New Iberia police force going after a drug-kingpin named Tony Cardo.  Clete Purcel tags along to guard Robicheaux's back, and they wouldn't mind catching up with the man who nearly killed Robicheaux.

While the novel is disguised as a crime fiction work, it is much, much, much more.  It opens in a courtroom and involves a murder trial.  There is an unsolved mystery at the heart of the story.  It tackles the issue of racism and the sad chapter of American history in which loyal Americans were interned simply because of their ethnic heritage.  Additionally, the novel deals with the concepts of loyalty and honor as felt by the leading characters.  SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS is also a love story (complete with a triangle), but most of all Guterson's writing captures the atmosphere of his story's time and place with perfection.  SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS is one of the strongest books written in the last quarter-century.	2001-08-08

At one recent convention, I was sitting on an author panel discussing &quot;The Private Eye.&quot;  Following our presentation, a reader in the audience asked us to trace the development of the modern private eye.  I fielded that question and explained that Raymond Chandler's THE BIG SLEEP is one of the crucial developmental steps along the way to the private eyes contemporary authors write about today.  In THE BIG SLEEP, Chandler started with a pulp magazine character-type and transformed that character-type into a Romantic hero--the modern urban knight-errant.  He took Hammett's tough guy, kept him tough yet gave him heart.  THE BIG SLEEP tells a complicated tale in a complicated fashion.  William Faulkner, when he was scripting the classic Bogart film, claimed he couldn't comprehend the plot.  I've always assumed Faulkner was joking.  The story can be comprehended by even small minds, like mine.  The story involves murder, blackmail, gambling, a family of great wealth, self-destructiveness, and other standard plot fixtures of detective fiction.  Most importantly, this book marks the debut of Philip Marlowe.  Without Chandler's Marlowe the mystery genre would not be what it is today.	2001-08-08

It is a historical novel set in a time period we would all recognize as modern.  The story takes place early in the 20th Century.  It involves a young woman who struggles to deal with all of her society's restrictive expectations upon young women in that era as well as with her own personal desires for her life.  Amanda Starkey is a Lutheran girl who finds herself forbidden from marrying a Catholic boy in rural Wisconsin.  She becomes a nurse in Milwaukee, and she finds herself seduced by a man into what was then considered dishonor.  She returns to the family farm where a number of family members die--some from the influenza epidemic sweeping the world.  Caring for her drowned sister's child becomes primarily her responsibility, even after her brother-in-law returns from WWI.  As the story progresses, there are many questions that need to be answered and once the answers arrive, they are most enlightening.  DROWNING RUTH is a terrific first novel.	2001-08-07

It has all the elements of a classic mystery.  Its leads are two hungry reporters who risk their lives to expose governmental corruption.  There is a powerful villian in opposition to our heroic journalists, and some courageous indviduals in control of the newspaper who support the reporters when it would be easy to throw them to the wolves.  There is even a shadowy character who hangs out in parking lots and passes on crucial information to our leads.  If this book was fiction, no one would believe the plot.

It is a fresh mystery in many ways, yet it is also as frightening and chilling a story as one would ever want to read.  Alison Carter, a thirteen-year-old, vanishes in late 1963.  George Bennett, a young detective, is given the case to investigate.  He finds that he is not merely confronted by the mysterious disappearance of a young girl.  He is also confronted by Alison's hometown itself, the village of Scardale.  Scardale is an insular village along the moors--a village that is in most ways isolated from the modern world.  The people of Scardale seem to close ranks against the police officer.  Scardale's residents include several likely suspects, and Bennett must figure out whether a series of other disappearances has anything to do with his case.  This puzzle element of the mystery is merely one part of Ms. McDermid's brilliant novel.  Once the case is supposedly solved, other questions arise decades later.  A PLACE OF EXECUTION is one of the most original mysteries I have read in a long time.  It deserves the awards it has been receiving.	2001-08-07

Kate Chopin's THE AWAKENING was not only banned.  It was also suppressed for many years.  I cannot understand why.  THE AWAKENING is a beautifully written book dealing with a woman, Edna Pontellier, and her desire for emancipation.  Edna is dissatisfied with her role in her society, and she takes positive steps to change it.  While THE AWAKENING may have pushed the envelope for its time, that was no excuse to ban and suppress it.

Those readers expecting to find in this book the famous Holmes line about the dog that didn't bark will be disappointed.  That nonbarking dog isn't here.  It's in one of the Holmes short stories.  What we have here is a moody work set among the moors with a strong and obvious Gothic influence upon Doyle by the mystery genre's founder, Edgar Allan Poe.  Holmes and his supporting cast are all in fine form.  The plot works, as does the setting and the tone.  THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES has endured.  It will continue to endure in the future.

I never realized its impact on me until a reader recently commented to me about how my debut book also centered on a disintegrating dysfunctional family, mentioning THE SOUND AND THE FURY by name.  Telling the tale, at least on the surface, of the Compson family from the various perspectives of the final generation of what was a once-great Mississippi family, Faulkner's masterpiece addresses all types of ultra-serious questions and themes.  Whether the portion of the novel focuses on the character of Benjy, Quentin, Caddy or Jason, Faulkner continues making his points.  It is unbelievably powerful.

It has now been fifty years since THE CATCHER IN THE RYE was first published, and Salinger's story of Holden Caulfield rings as true today as it ever has.  Holden's angst-filled voice remains heartfelt and honest.  It is a book that everyone should read at least once.  It should be read several times. It is a masterpiece, and Salinger should be proud.  I am certain he is.  Now, if he'd only agree to go on a book promotion tour.  There is no better way to see America and meet the American reading public!	2001-08-06

The vendetta defense pinpoints exactly one of the major ambiguities within enigmas within this legal thriller. Pigeon Tony Lucia, Judy Carrier's client, has killed Angelo Coluzzi, and he freely admits his crime.  As he is willing to tell everyone, the murder was payback for decades-old crimes committed against Tony's family.  Judy has to devise a legal defense for Tony, a good man who has done wrong, perhaps.  The swiftly-paced plot is complicated by a romance for Judy and death threats against Tony, Judy, and others.  This novel succeeds on many levels.  It is a winner.	2001-08-05

Ms. George was an excellent and entertaining writer, and MURDER DIRTY BOOGIES WITH ELVIS proves my point perfectly.  All of the elements of Ms. George's works are here as the murder of an Elvis impersonator must be solved.  This book is well-written, with a twisting plot and a light tone.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and only wish there were more of these books to come.	2001-08-05

As a crime fiction author with my debut novel in its initial release, I am quite impressed with John Grisham's new novel, A PAINTED HOUSE.  While there are no lawyers anywhere in sight in this story taking place in rural Arkansas, there are some crimes and needing-to-be answered questions in this book.  Grisham also touches on the theme of racial interaction between Mexican migrant laborers and poor whites (a theme familiar to my readers).  For the most part, Grisham uses A PAINTED HOUSE to evoke a time and a place.  He also makes good use of his youthful protagonist.  He achieves what he sets out to do, and he does it effectively.  A PAINTED HOUSE is, perhaps, John Grisham's strongest book yet.	2001-08-05

Published originally over four decades ago, it captures its time and its place with utter accuracy yet the novel still applies to our society that has been transformed in many significant ways since Rabbit Angstrom first appeared on the literary scene.  While he is destined for greater material success in Updike's later Rabbit novels, Rabbit is a salesman living a marginal life with an alcoholic wife in RABBIT, RUN.  Brilliant prose stylist that he is, Updike spins a winning story about these characters, and it is a story that will seemingly survive upon the American literary landscape for as long as there are readers of fine books.	2001-08-05

In MAGGODY AND THE MOONBEAMS, Ms. Hess proves my point perfectly.  Arly Hanks is chaperoning a group of teenagers who are on a repair mission to Camp Pearly Gates.  Those of us who have read our share of Arly's adventures know well that complications will arise.  In this book, Arly finds herself tangling with the Moonbeams, an all-female cult whose members are often mistaken for aliens.  As Arly attempts to solve the murder of a moonbeam member, Ms. Hess tells her tale in her usual hilarious manner.  MAGGODY AND THE MOONBEAMS has everything we have grown to expect from Ms. Hess.

She manipulates her cousin Vinnie into letting her give the bond recovery business a try.  She has to bring in Joe Morelli, an ex-boyfriend from her teengirl years.

At one recent Texas appearance, a woman asked me about the titles I considered the most significant in American noir fiction.  James M. Cain's DOUBLE INDEMNITY was the first novel I mentioned.  It tells the tale of Walter Huff, an ordinary good man who suddenly goes extraordinarily wrong.  Phyllis Nirdlinger wants to get rid of her husband, and Walter, a insurance peddler, shows her how to maximize her (their) gain.  To succeed, they need to fool Huff's insurance company, Phyllis Nirdlinger's husband and daughter, and the daughter's boyfiend.  Along the way, DOUBLE INDEMNITY becomes a chilling morality tale, not to mention Cain's masterpiece.	2001-08-05

THE NAKED AND THE DEAD is one of those books.  This novel, one of the first books to emerge from the second world war, instantly established Norman Mailer as the leading writer of his generation--a title he, more or less, still holds today.  It tells the tale of the greatest generation in their greatest hour.  It presents war in powerfully truthful terms.  It also presents its characters in human terms with human concerns.  Mailer did everything well in THE NAKED AND THE DEAD.  Few authors, myself included, have seldom come close--though most of us do know how to correctly spell a certain word.	2001-08-04

During that hour or so, one person after another asked Mr. Bishop to sign TEQUILA MOCKINGBIRD, most praising the title.  The book does have a great title, but it is also a fine mystery.  The plot involves the murder of a member of LAPD's anti-terrorism unit, and Fey Croaker's search for the truth.  The plot takes many unexpected twists and turns, and soon Fey is struggling to protect Los Angeles from an international terrorist attack.  Paul Bishop is a pro, and TEQUILA MOCKINGBIRD is a top-notch book.  There is much to savor in TEQUILA MOCKINGBIRD in addition to its clever title.	2001-08-04

THE SUN ALSO RISES is one of those books.  I read it first as a teenager.  I then read it six or seven times for courses as an undergraduate and a graduate student at Claremont.  THE SUN ALSO RISES tells the story of the Lost Generation.  It is Hemingway's career-defining novel as well as the novel that captured like none other the lifestyle and concerns of his American expatriot associates.  Jake, an emasculated World War I veteran, narrates the story.  Jake is in love with Brett who perhaps loves him in return, yet their love cannot be consummated.  Robert, ostensibly Jake's best friend, and Frances, Robert's girl friend, are on hand as Jake and Lady Brett struggle with their problem.  Mike, the Lady's fiance, also finds his place in the story.  Hemingway, working at the top of his talent before his persona began to envelop his writing, presents the moveable feast of Paris and the bullfighting life in Spain.  While THE SUN ALSO RISES is far from politically correct, it is a groundbreaking novel that still speaks to people today.	2001-08-04

She decides on the changes she wants, and she goes out and makes them.  She even meets the man of her dreams, yet by then she is in severe personal danger.

In DEAD SLEEP, Greg Iles tells the story of photojournalist Jordan Glass.  Jordan discovers her twin sister's face in a portrait of a dead woman.  The sister has been missing for over a year, and she is assumed to be the victim of a serial killer.  Strangely enough, the other women pictured in the exhibit's other paintings are also missing/dead.  John Kaiser, FBI agent, drafts Jordan into helping the Feds find the artist.  There are also suggestions that there may be a linkage to Jordan's father's disappearance in Vietnam decades ago.  With DEAD SLEEP, Iles has given us another first-class thriller.  Great work.	2001-08-03

The story in CANE RIVER stretches out for over a century in Louisiana.  It shows how these women in this society managed to endure and prevail, yet it also shows some unusual perspectives on racial injustice.  It doesn't pull any punches or sugarcoat reality.

Oops, that transfer proves to be a mistake.  Rachel discovers a poaching operation backed by the Russian Mafia.  Her discovery leads to murder, and we all know who plans to solve the murder.

THE GODWULF MANUSCRIPT marks Spenser's debut.  In his spare time, his hobby is woodcarving.  He also likes to cook--which is handy because Susan Silverman struggles to boil water.  But that doesn't matter here because Susan isn't yet in this series.  Neither is Hawk or Pearl the Wonder Dog, but Spenser's essence is the same as it is in Parker's recent works.  In THE GODWULF MANUSCRIPT, Spenser is hired by a college to recover a stolen manuscript.  A murder occurs, and a stunning coed is the obvious murderer.  Obvious is not alway correct, and Spenser proves that simple truth true, not for the last time.  THE GODWULF MANUSCRIPT marks an auspicious debut for Spenser.  While some of the trappings and the supporting cast have changed as Robert B. Parker has developed his series, Spenser remains true to his inner soul.	2001-08-03

He wants to take it easy and attempt to come to terms with what he views as his past failures in life.  He finds himself roped into playing goalie on a local hockey team, and that involvement leads to a number of complications.  This book has a twisting and turning plot that deals with the hardships of Native Americans, drug dealing, domestic abuse, and a number of other wrongs.  It is a serious book with serious concerns.

In THE BLACK DAHLIA, Ellroy takes personal possession of the famous murder of Elizabeth Short, a Hollywood hopeful.  The torture/homicide actually happened in the late Forties.  It remains unsolved as of today.  Ellroy blends the actual known facts with his fictional creations involving the case.  His book centers on two obsessed LAPD detectives searching for the murderer.  To some degree, his fictionalization of the Black Dahlia case is highly personal, involving speculation upon events in his own life.  THE BLACK DAHLIA is Ellroy's master work.  It succeeds on all levels.	2001-08-02

It established the tone for the series, and THE CAT WHO COULD READ BACKWARDS is a top-notch cozy standing purely on its own.

It is written in deceptively simple English--perfect for teenagers still struggling with their second language (or third language for youths who first learned to speak an indigenous native language).  It tells the tale of a girl named Esperanza as she learns about life growing up in Chicago living in a house on Mango Street.  In a series of powerful vignettes, Cisneros reveals the truth about the girl's life--a truth that Esperanza has not quite yet realized.  While the book has a focus on a Latino girl, the book is universal.  You don't have to be a Danish prince to be touched by HAMLET, and the same is true about THE HOUSE ON MANGO STREET.  The vignettes illustrate Esperanza's life, learnings, and yearnings.  They reveal her dreams--dreams that reach far beyond Mango Street.	2001-08-01

Levinson among my friends, I freely admit that I might be biased here.  Regardless, I believe THE JOHN LENNON AFFAIR is Mr. Levinson's strongest work.  As I read the previous statement, I realize it is quite strong.  After all, Mr. Levinson's previous mystery, THE JAMES DEAN AFFAIR, camped at the top of the LA TIMES Bestseller List so long that everyone stopped counting the weeks.  In THE JOHN LENNON AFFAIR, Mr. Levinson draws upon his vast experience in the recording industry to give this work's backdrop a realistic feel.  Being of the generation that can tell you what I was doing when I heard John was shot--listening to a Wings LP--I enjoyed the novel's opening sequence involving the events immediately following John's murder.  Mr. Levinson then brings us to the present day and involves his series characters Neil, the journalist, and Stevie, the soap opera star, in a complicated scheme involving a music festival.  The festival is being held in John's memory in a small desert town near Palm Springs, yet not all with the festival is on the up and up.  The plot twists and turns.  The characters are loads of fun.  The Gulliver-Marriner divorce continues to stumble along; their divorce seems not to be finalized.  The dialog is crisp.  The setting is so realistically rendered that I instantly identified the actual locations in the fictionalized locales.  THE JOHN LENNON AFFAIR is a top-notch mystery, Robert S.

The Prime Minister secretly requests that Alex Plumtree of Plumtree Press publish CLEANSING.  CLEANSING seems like a total mismatch for Plumtree.  Plumtree is among the most respectable British publishers and CLEANSING is a highly controversial and sensational work.  Once the book's publication is announced, Alex Plumtree finds himself entanlged in all sorts of troubles--some violent, some legal.

The cleverness in this work doesn't stop with the title.  While Ayelet Waldman's tone for the most part is light, she addresses some serious themes here.  Her sleuth, Juliet Applebaum, L.A. public defender turned stay-at-home mom, represents many contemporary women juggling the various facets of their overcrowded lives.  Ms. Waldman has given us a first-rate mystery involving the disappearance of young Fraydle Finkelstein.  She draws vivid contrasts between the worlds of conservative Judaism and Applebaum's liberal Hollywood style.  All in all, Ms. Waldman has written a fine book here.  You won't fall alseep reading THE BIG NAP.	2001-07-31

Detective David Dean has left his home in Pennsylvania to recover from gunshot wounds.  He finds trouble follows him to scenic Colorado, and TIME TRIAL is a fast-paced and complex thriller.  I recommend it highly, as I do the other works by Ray Derouin, a talented writer, as well as a charming and interesting man.	2001-07-30

Le Carre takes the complex issues involved in the Middle East and personalizes these issues with an intricate plot and vividly drawn characters.  He makes the underlying and conflicting truths beneath this permanent international hotspot comprehensible to all who read his novel.  Charlie, a beautiful actress, is lured into participating in a mission to entrap a Palestinian terrorist.  Le Carre avoids simple answers and presents the views of all sides fairly.  LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL is a terrific book, one I always recall when there is additional senseless violence in that most unfortunate world region.	2001-07-30

I re-read Mr. Michener's ALASKA to help me prepare for my journey.  ALASKA, while a work of fiction, is amazingly informative and educational.  James Michener is a masterful story teller, yet he always gives his reader a thorough feel for the setting he is writing about.  In ALASKA, Michener covers that vastness we know as Alaska--from its earliest history to its present day challenges.  When I arrived in Alaska, I felt most comfortable in that unique state because I had just read this book.  It is a master work.	2001-07-29

I freely admit to this bias, but I still assert AND THE DYING IS EASY provides an excellent introduction to contemporary mystery short fiction.  Some big names are featured--Dana Stabenow, Max Allan Collins and Tamar Myers among them.  Some reasonably new authors are also featured.  There is a wide variety of story types in this collection--some as cozy as cozies get while others reach the level of gritty to the extreme.  Various authors use historical and contemporary settings.  I particularly enjoyed Matt Witten's, Andy Straka's, Sam McCarver's, and k.j.a. Wishnia's tales.  AND THE DYING EASY is such a fine introduction to short form mysteries that I, in my role as university professor, have made this book part of the assigned reading for my writing short mystery fiction course this fall at California State University.	2001-07-29

It is the most successful suspense/thriller series of all time--if one doesn't count Homer's heroic epics which are still in print a few millennia after they were written--and the series is still going strong in Raymond Benson's capable hands.  He was a Bond scholar before he began writing these new Bond novels, and he gets Ian Fleming's characters and attitudes correct.  NEVER DREAM OF DYING has everything one has grown to expect from a James Bond book or film.  There are super-villians, exotic locales, glamorous women, and a spectacular conclusion.  Read it and enjoy it.	2001-07-29

I thought then, and I still think today, that MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is the perfect classic mystery.  Christie created a murder in a stranded railroad car--a murder her sleuth Hercule Poirot must solve.  She has a classic collection of suspects, and a crime supposedly impossible to commit.  Poirot, of course, solves the crime, and I still admire this book decades after I first read it.	2001-07-29

I was sitting next to the current Edgar Award winner when a member of the audience asked us about the orgins of the present day fictional private eye.  I fielded the question and replied that the modern private investigator began with Dashiell Hammett.  While Hammett's Continental Op came first, Sam Spade in THE MALTESE FALCON defined literature's private eye for all time.  THE MALTESE FALCON is the defining book in mystery fiction.  It is required reading for any serious student of the mystery genre.  What Hammett did in this landmark novel, we have all been merely building on since.  THE MALTESE FALCON is the crucial book in the mystery genre.	2001-07-29

He transformed fiction with a focus on the shadowy world of espionage from the James Bond fantasies into a much fuller and realistic form of literature.  I believe THE PERFECT SPY is his best book.  Magnus Pym, a British agent, has vanished, and the search for the man ranges throughout America and Europe.  The most fascinating element of this novel concerns the exploration of Pym's personal past.  This book is excellent.  It is John Le Carre at his best.	2001-07-29

Even though SHATTERED may be his last book, Mr. Francis has not lost his touch in over forty full-length works.  All of his standard elements are here.  There is the horse racing backdrop.  There is a decent man who finds himself forced into reluctant heroism.  There is evil that must be defeated.  In SHATTERED, Mr. Francis introduces us to glass-blowing.  Gerard Logan is a close friend of Martin Stukely, a jockey who died in a bad fall a Cheltenham.  Gerard is beaten terribly in his glass-blowing studio.  A gang is responsible.  The gang includes the daughter of the late Martin's valet, and they are convinced that Gerard has in his possession a video tape.  The gang is willing to kill Gerard to get the tape.  The story flows from there, and it features a fine romance between Gerard and a policewoman.  SHATTERED is a winner.  I hope Mr. Francis writes forty more novels, though we all doubt if he now will.  If SHATTERED is the end of his career, he has ended on top.	2001-07-28

In this fourth outing,PISCES RISING, Elizabeth is mourning the death of her lover, and she becomes involved in investigating homicides that occur on an Indian reservation.  Gambling issues play a major part in this novel, as does Native American beliefs.  Ms. Lawrence tells a fine tale with a swiftly moving plot and fabulously drawn characters.

While it features Quinlin, a recovering alcoholic detective, and his partner, Paul McCarren, investigating the death of an investigative reporter with an Eastern Establishment background, Swindle's most impressive strength comes from his knowledge of Texas.  He renders the ambience of his setting as few other authors do.  His plot is also swiftly-paced with the powerful Colter family apparently involved in the crime.

The husband has served time in prison, and he blames his wife for the conviction.  Carmen fears her husband plans to pay her back for what has happened.

John Walker is drafted from his routine job by a shadowy Max Stillman to investigate insurance fraud against McClaren Life and Casualty.  Together, the men track their prime suspect ....

If it isn't the finest novel ever written (which I've been known to argue it is) or the finest American novel (which again I've been known to argue it is) or the finest Twentieth Century novel (which, you know the drill), it is the finest crime novel ever written.  I read this book annually.  Many other crime fiction writers do the same.  THE GREAT GATSBY is perfectly constructed, with ambiguities within enigmas, as it recounts the Jazz Age, capturing that era's ambience splendidly.  It is a crime novel, yet, as with the best crime novels, crime does not dominate the entire book.  At one level, it is the story of a poor boy who dreams of becoming rich and marrying an American golden girl.  On another level, it is the story of the American upper crust personified by that golden girl and her polo playing husband.  On still another level, it is the story of a young Midwestern gentleman who matures into genuine manhood one summer amid the parties and social events of East and West Eggs in Long Island.  It is the Tale of America.  No one has told it better than F. Scott Fitzgerald, either before or since.  Ever.	2001-07-26

In this most recent Dirk Pitt--the sixteenth, I believe--he is taking on an amoral outfit that calls itself The Fourth Empire.  Pitt enlists a beautiful expert in ancient languages to assist him in his battle with evil, and the action never stops to catch its breath.

I was not aware of this follow-up novel, THE DEADLIEST ART, until I read a glowing review of it in THE LA TIMES. Now that I've read this new work, I can attest that that wise TIMES critic was correct. THE DEADLIEST ART is a winner. In this novel, Michel Danton is back on the scene. He is preparing to marry Jennifer Bowen, the American professor who saved his life in Bogner's previous book. Events intervene. An acid-scarred body of an American junior golfer is found on a beach and other murders occur. The police begin their investigation, and Bogner presents flashbacks of the criminals in alternate chapters. The flashbacks begin in Venice Beach in California, near my home turf. The story works. Bogner captures his settings pefectly. His characters are vividly drawn. THE DEADLIEST ART is an excellent crime fiction work.	2001-07-23

The mystery begins routinely enough with Travis, a former cop, coming out of retirement because of the recent murder of a woman whom he suspects is the victim of a serial killer who got away when Travis was still on the force. From that seemingly routine launch, the plot moves swiftly and unexpectedly. Birtcher writes tough prose and captures the essence of a tough world. ROADHOUSE BLUES is contemporary noir at its best.	2001-07-23

In FATAL VOYAGE,Tempe Brennan, a forensic anthropologist, is serving as a member of an investigating team searching through the remains of a plane crash.  Complications arise.  No signs of two passengers can be found, and an extra body seems to be at the crash site.  Tempe finds her professional reputation challenged, and she finds herself involved in crimes stretching back decades.  Ms. Reichs keeps her plot moving swiftly, and her characters are interesting and vividly drawn.  FATAL VOYAGE is another terrific book written by Kathy Reichs.	2001-07-23

Kay Scarpetta is a marvelous creation, and in this novel, Kay struggles to resolve numerous unresolved issues.  Her therapist puts it that way, as will the typical reader.  THE LAST PRECINCT grows directly out of the events of Ms. Cornwell's most recent novels.  This book has everything the Cornwell fan has grown to expect from Kay and the series.  All the usual characters are on hand, even a certain deceased man, in a certain way.  The plot twists and turns, and THE LAST PRECINCT is a winner.	2001-07-22

In DEMOLITION ANGEL, Crais takes a break from Elvis.  Following the recent trend of many male mystery writers, he selects a female for his protagonist in this non-series novel.  Unlike many men writing women, Crais creates a realistic and multi-dimensional character.  Carol Starkey is a scarred woman--both physically and emotionally.  Her lover was killed in an explosion, and now years later, she is still struggling to deal with her life.  Booze and drugs help her get through most days.  In DEMOLITION ANGEL, she finds herself involved in searching for a homicidal maniac in an investigation her life and experience has prepared her for in a way no one else's has.  DEMOLITION ANGEL is an awe-inspiring novel with a true winning lead.  Great book.	2001-07-22

At one of my early bookstore appearances, a noted bookseller drew my attention to Peter Moore Smith's RAVELING.  The bookseller was correct.  RAVELING is a extraordinary work.  It deals with a disintegrating family.  Pilot is the schizophrenic son.  Pilot's older brother, Eric, is a prominent neurosurgeon.  Twenty years earlier, Fiona, the little sister, disappeared.  The novel deals with the relationship between the past and the present as well as Pilot's constantly fluctuating boundary between illusion and reality.  It addresses cruelty and abuse and the complex relationships within the Airie family.  RAVELING is truly a masterpiece, deserving of the recgonition it has received.	2001-07-21

I was glad I did.  Stan Jones has a terrific book here.  His protagonist, Inuit Alaskan state trooper Nathan Active is a winner.  WHITE SKY, BLACK ICE succeeds on many diverse levels.  It tells a first-class story.  It creates vivid characters.  It captures the ambience of the Alaskan Bush.  The book made such a strong impression on me that I agreed to travel to the Alaskan Bush as part of the following year's Left Coast Crime convention in Anchorage.  WHITE SKY, BLACK ICE is a fine book.  Stan Jones should be deservedly proud of his accomplishment.	2001-07-21

Written by Tess Collins, a coal miner's granddaughter, THE LAW OF THE DEAD gives the reader a taste of life in Appalachia.  Set in Contrary Kentucky, the book features a strong female lead.  Alma Bashears was born and raised in Contrary, yet she relocated to California.  Now she is home in Appalachia, relearning her old turf, and dealing with a series of seemingly random acts of violence.  This novel succeeds on many levels.  Terrific plot.  Memorable characters.

Nancy Pickard does break with our patterns in THE WHOLE TRUTH, and she succeeds masterfully.  The book opens with the conviction of Raymond Raintree for the murder of Natalie McCullen.

In CONSPIRACY OF PAPER, Mr. Liss takes his readers on a tour of early 18th Century London.  His protagonist, Benjamin Weaver, is a Jewish former boxer who describes himself as a &quot;constable for hire&quot;.  The possibly accidental death of his father, from whom he is estranged, leads Weaver immediately to two clients who hire him for quite different purposes.  As Weaver pursues his cases, he exposes the 21st Century reader to life in England three hundred years ago.  We see how the London stock market worked.  We visit the worlds of boxing and of brothels.  We observe Weaver's struggles with descrimination.  All in all, a fine first book.	2001-07-18

He is a lawyer turned bagman who is killing time on Christmas Eve awaiting his partner in crime.  They have embezzled enough cash from their employer to fund a new life.

No one writes comic caper books better than Mr. Westlake.  After Dortmunder's first attempt at crime in this novel ends in a bungled burglary, Andy Kelp approaches Dortmunder with a unique offer.  As part of a complicated scam to gain control of an Indian casino, Dortmunder is asked to remove a long dead body from a grave and replace it with the equally-dead ancestor of a woman fashioning herself as Little Feather.  Fitzroy Guilderpost arranged this scam over the Internet, and the story takes wild and hilarious swings from there.

We frequently serve as members of the same author panels, and I am always proud to be part of the same panel as Ms. Grady.  MAXIMUM INSECURITY is a terrific debut novel, and Matty Madrid is an amazing creation.  Matty is true to life.  Ms. Grady has a thorough understanding of the Hispanic culture of northern New Mexico.  Matty accurately reflects her time and place.  In MAXIMUM INSECURITY, Matty is hired to investigate the murder of a prison inmate.  That murder proves to be merely the tip of an enormous iceberg of corruption.  During the course of Matty's investigation, the reader learns much about this young woman PI and the world in which she operates.  MAXIMUM INSECURITY was most deserving of its Shamus Award nomination.	2001-07-17

It may be, but his novels are also extremely fun take-offs on the mystery genre.  SPANKING WATSON is a perfect example of a mature Friedman masterpiece.  Its plot is a pure invention--Kinky wants a Watson and he manipulates a situation to force each of his Irregulars into auditioning for the role.  The invented situation becomes threateningly real, but that danger doesn't stop Kinky or his hangers-on from going through their usual motions.  SPANKING WATSON has everything one expects in a Kinky Friedman, for better and for worse.  I'm not Nixoning you.	2001-07-17

In THE DEADER THE BETTER, Leo Waterman attempts to determine what actually happened to a friend of his whose death in Steven's Falls has been ruled a suicide.  He drags together an odd group of characters, even odder than usual, to assist him in his effort, and Rebecca Duvall is on the scene to what she does as well as any girlfriend in mysterydom.  The book has a swiftly-moving plot and a truly-rendered setting.  It is most deserving of its recent Shamus Award nomination.	2001-07-12

Someone is killing off &quot;smooth&quot; jazz musicians.  All right, so those folks perhaps ought to die, but Horne needs to catch the killer anyway.

His choice of Leslie Charteris, once an actual passenger on the Hindenburg, as a sleuth was a masterstroke of brilliance.  The novel's use of a historical situation and actual people's names was deftly handled.  Collins has built a crisp mystery in a realistic-feeling setting.

STRIP TEASE is one of Hiaasen's best.  A reluctant stripper and a unique cop join forces in this novel to nail a corrupt congressman and solve the heroine's child custody problems.  Hiaasen has his usual fun with Florida's lifestyle and social/environmental problems.  His biting satire may seem too tough, but one has to remember this state's role in Bush v. Gore.  Don't let the infamous film scare you off from this fine book.  There is no Demi Moore in these pages, yet there is plenty of terrific writing.	2001-07-12

While Travis McGee is always Travis McGee, I always contend that CINNAMON SKIN is the best work in MacDonald's colorful series.

First, let me admit to being biased.  I recently appeared in Alaska as an author at the Left Coast Crime mystery convention that Sue Henry had a major part in arranging.  I also had a room at the Anchorage Hilton with a spectacluar view of the genuine Sleeping Lady.  My view of that mountain was nada compared to Sue Henry's Alex Jensen novel SLEEPING LADY.  Ms. Henry's scenic descriptions are unequaled in contemporary fiction.  She also knows her territory--Alaska--well.  By reading these Alex Jensen books, one learns what our last frontier is all about and what one needs to do to survive in that rugged land.  The plot twisted and turned to the last page, and I felt the mystery was handled excellently.  I am enjoying how Ms. Henry's characters are growing with each book.  All in all, SLEEPING LADY is a terrific novel.  If you've been to Alaska, as I have, you will love it.  If you haven't been to Alaska, you will love it even more (and also add that great state to your travel plans).  I encourage everyone to read Sue Henry's SLEEPING LADY.	2001-07-10

She's in Mississippi, and she has finally accepted a promotion.  She also finds a dead prom queen.  We know she will struggle to solve this homicide.  The mystery is first-rate, and Ms. Barr continues with her excellent character development.  Her scenic descriptions shine, as does her descriptions of contemporary life in Mississippi.

I felt then, and still feel today, that GUNS AND ROSES marks a remarkable debut for Ms. Cannon's new series.  Roxanne, her travel guide sleuth who happens to be a former cop, is a winner.  Irish Eyes Travel can eventually feature mysteries set anywhere in the world.  In this series debut, Roxanne is confronted with crimes (including murder) as she leads a tour group through colonial sites in Virginia.  I thoroughly enjoyed her story, and I've recommended the book to a number mystery readers groups to whom I've spoken.

SUGAR HOUSE is Lippman's first hardcover mystery, and it is a fabulous novel.  Lippman's protagonist, Tess Monaghan, agrees to her father's request and attempts to identify a nameless dead girl whose murderer himself was murdered.  To accomplish this task, Lippman takes us on a tour of the Atlantic coast.  Tess journeys from her usual stomping grounds of Baltimore to Annapolis, Philadelphia, and Maryland's Eastern Shore.  Lippman continues to develop her Tess character, as well as several supporting characters.  SUGAR HOUSE's plot is first-rate, and Lippman's writing is smooth.  It is difficult to believe that it has taken five paperback books for Tess to reach hardcover.  SUGAR HOUSE is a great mystery, and I recommend it highly.	2001-07-06

In this debut adventure for his PI, Duncan Sloan is given the job of tracking down a gang of thieves who withdrew a gay millionaire's sperm deposit from a sperm bank and used it to impregnate a woman from a trailer park who is dreaming of a big score from her maternity.  The noirish plot grows wilder from there, and you need to read STREET LEVEL to believe it.  Keep in mind it's set in Florida.  It's a great debut mystery.  I recommend it heartily.	2001-07-06

In ONE VIRGIN TOO MANY, there is one corpse to few.  Falco, the first-century Roman sleuth in this fine series, returns from his African adventure with the resources to move his family into a more comfortable living environment.  When his brother-in-law stumbles across a body that disappears before it can be identified, it is up to Falco to solve the murder.  With his ironic view of the world and his snappy patter, the emperor's spy proves he is up to the task.  He discovers how the dead man is connected to a six-year-old who is in line to be a vestal virgin.  His dealings with a former vestal virgin nearly costs him his life.  ONE VIRGIN TOO MANY has everything we have grown to expect from the work of Ms. Davis.  Her imperial Roman setting is believable.  Her characters are intriguing.  Her plot is well-paced.  ONE VIRGIN TOO MANY is one of best in the Falco series.  I recommend it heartily.	2001-07-06

First of all, it introduces a winning amateur sleuth--Skye Denison.  This protagonist is a contemporary every-woman, someone who is doing her best to do well in life on many levels--despite hardsips she encounters.  Secondly, Ms. Swanson provides realistic insights into public education.  She hits that social institution right on the bull's-eye.  Thirdly, her tone and attitude is perfectly suited for the contemporary cozy-type mystery.  Finally, MURDER OF A SMALL-TOWN HONEY has a fabulous mystery plot at its heart.  It is a solid debut of what I hope will be a long line of Scumble River Mysteries.	2001-07-05

Her freed slave/sleuth Benjamin January reluctantly agrees to return to Simon Fourchet's plantation to bring an end to the sabotage of the plantation and the reprisals Fourchet and his henchmen are inflicting upon their slaves.  SOLD DOWN THE RIVER is an effective book.  It is a horrifying book.  Ms. Hambly has done her research, and she pulls no punches.  In SOLD DOWN THE RIVER, she clearly presents the horrors slaves endured during that era of American history.  Along the way, she tells a first-class tale centering on a top-notch mystery.	2001-07-05

His Nero Wolfe series shows us all how a master works.  FER-DE-LANCE was the first book in Stout's lengthy series, and he had all the elements of his series in place when he wrote this excellent mystery.  He combined the softer classic tradition, personified by Nero Wolfe, with the tougher hardboiled tradition, personified by Archie Goodwin.  They work together in this novel to solve this homicide, as they will in dozens of future novels.  His famous list of suspects with their lists of peculiarities are introduced in this novel as are the tensions between Wolfe and Goodwin that will play out for decades.  FER-DE-LANCE is a classic of American mystery fiction.	2001-07-05

It showed me how powerful mystery writing can be and led me to my writing aspirations in this literary field.  BLACK MONEY is among my favorite Macdonald books.  It's an updated version of THE GREAT GATSBY, moved to the southern California coast.  Archer is hired to investigate a young man who arrives in an affluent coastal city presenting himself as an aristocratic Frenchman.  He wins the heart of the most desirable maiden in town, and people are suspicious about this aristocrat's background.  Archer investigates and uncovers to sorry truth about several different people.

Set in Scottsdale, it marks the literary birth of Lena Jones--the newest female PI in the long and distinguished line launched by Marcia Muller over two decades ago.  Lena Jones knows little about her personal history--as a small child a bullet erased her memory and landed her in a series of foster homes.  This case, a mystery involving the art world, gives Lena hope she might discover the truth about her actual identity.  It also involves the murder of one of Lena's close friends.  There are plenty of suspects ranging from the victim's husband to artists, family members, and professional rivals.  In addition to the mystery elements, the novel presents a realistic picture of life in modern Arizona ranging from its deep native cultural roots to its contemporary urban sprawl.  All in all, DESERT NOIR marks an impressive and auspicious debut for Betty Webb.	2001-07-04

As an American of Japanese heritage living in Tokyo, Rei provides unique insights into both cultures.  In FLOATING GIRL, Massey weaves many subplots together while focusing on the Japanese fascination with animation--manga.  A man Rei meets is murdered, and a manga artist may hold the solution to the crime.  With FLOATING GIRL, Massey continues to take giant strides forward as a writer--braving new frontiers in her mystery sub-genre.  FLOATING GIRL is a solid effort, and I recommend it highly.	2001-07-04

I first read it too many years ago upon its initial publication, and I try to re-read it annually.  It captures the environment of Southern California in a way few other works do.  Telling the story of a young man who comes to Huntington Beach in search of his missing sister, the novel becomes a morality play featuring surfers, bikers, and cultists.  The plot takes many unexpected twists and turns.  The characters are memorable.  The setting is dead-on.  Great book.  If you haven't read TAPPING THE SOURCE, do.  Soon.	2001-07-03

He is undeniably prolific, and his works are always of top quality.  THE LAST DANCE proves my points perfectly.  It is McBain's 50th 87th Precinct novel, and all the usual cops are on the scene doing their things.  McBain shows them living their lives and performing their jobs.  THE LAST DANCE is the police procedural at its best.  It's a great novel in a great series.  Ed McBain's work is unbelievable.	2001-07-03

I have been reading his Mickey Rawlings novels since the beginning, and I wrote an early critical essay about them that appeared in Mystery Reader's Journal.  Since the publication of that essay, Soos has written two fresh Mickey Rawlings mysteries, and HANGING CURVE is easily the strongest in the entire series.  HANGING CURVE lands Mickey, our journeyman everyman, in St. Louis where he is playing for the Browns and tangling with the KKK.  He's attempting to solve a murder, a lynching, amid the racial turmoil of the Roaring Twenties in America's Midwest.  As always, the mystery elements of these books are terrific.  Another crucial element of these novels is the historical backdrop that Soos paints with his words.  His history is painstakingly researched and utterly accurate.  In HANGING CURVE, Soos presents an era with social problems of which many people may be unaware.  On all levels, HANGING CURVE is the best mystery Troy Soos has written so far.  Great book, whether or not you love baseball (as you should).	2001-07-02

Coben has been guest of honor, toastmaster, charity auctioneer, and particpant on the most popular author panels.  Coben's rise to the top of the mystery world began with this book--DEAL BREAKER.  It introduces Myron Bolitar, his sports agent protagonist.  DEAL BREAKER also sets the tone for the most successful new series in mystery fiction to commence in recent years.  If you like your mysteries fast-paced and witty, DEAL BREAKER will be for you.  It is a terrific book, and it launched a spectacular series.	2001-07-01

He has been guest honor, toastmaster, charity auctioneer, and participant on the most popular author panels.  His recnt work, TELL NO ONE, perfectly illustrates the reason for this fine author's enormous popularity.  TELL NO ONE, a stand-alone thriller, involves a man named David Beck who has rebuilt his life following the murder of his wife, who also happened to be his childhood sweetheart.  As David continues to attempt to move on from his great personal tragedy, suggestions arise that unanswered questions involving his wife's death can still be answered.  David sets out to answer those questions in this most fulfilling thriller.  TELL NO ONE is a great book, and Harlan Coben proves his literary range stretches far beyond his popular series set-up.  I recommend this book heartily.	2001-07-01

Walter Mosley is one of the major talents in the crime fiction field, and his debut mystery is a terrific book.  Easy Rawlings is a landmark character.  Mosley handles his post-war Los Angeles setting better than any other author I can recall.  This book could have been written by Raymond Chandler had he focused on an African-American protagonist.  This book deals with California themes as well as Ross Macdonald did at his best.  DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS is a contemporary classic.	2001-06-30

It is simply too perfect.  Set against the backdrop of the Los Angeles civil disturbances of the too recent past, Woods creates a perfect heroine for the police procedural of today.  Charlotte Justice is struggling with emotional baggage, yet she is trying to move on with her life.  She suffers from various types of discrimination as an LAPD officer, yet she is dedicated to her work.  In INNER CITY BLUES, Detective Justice is faced with a baffling case mixing her personal past, the murder of her husband, with the racially turbulent situation in Los Angeles following the Rodney King verdict.  Charlotte Justice is a convincing contemporary woman with internal struggles and external challenges.  Ms. Woods captures her setting perfectly, and her plot is swiftly paced.  INNER CITY BLUES is an excellent book, most deserving of the recognition it has received.	2001-06-30

Warshawski's Impressive Comeback	Being a mystery writer with my first book in its initial release, I fondly recall reading Sara Paretsky's V.I. Warshawski series to see how a star of crime fiction developed one of the top mystery series of our time.  Then, V.I. vanished.  After approximately five years, Paretsky has written a fresh V.I Warshawski mystery, and HARD TIME is as impressive as her earlier works.  V.I. and her supporting cast have aged, and Murray has switched from print to television journalism.  Murray's career evolution indirectly lands V.I. at a celebrity party that launches this adventure.  There is an automobile accident, police abuse of power, corporate corruption, and V.I. standing up to the powers that be.  She lands in prison, and our dog-loving detective uses that opportunity to expose more crimes.  HARD TIME is a fabulous book, capturing Chicago and its environs in a way few other authors do.

It deserves this honor.  THE BOTTOMS will likely be Joe Lansdale's breakthrough work.  It transcends the mystery genre.  It marks fresh ground for Mr. Lansdale.  THE BOTTOMS deals with a series of murders during the depression.  It is told from the perspective of a child who observes his father attempting to solve the serial murders that begin with the murder and multilation of a black prostitute.  The narrator and his brother are the ones who discover this initial victim.  While the mysterious Goat Man plays a significant part in the plot of this mystery, so does the KKK.  The issue of race relations and the value of human life are important themes in this work.  THE BOTTOMS is a terrific novel, and it is most deserving of the honors it has received.	2001-06-29

Amos Walker is a masterful creation, and A SMILE ON THE FACE OF THE TIGER is a masterful work.  In this novel, Walker is hired by a New York publisher to hunt down a paperback mystery writer who will not allow his fifty-year-old classic to be reprinted.  Along the way, Walker discovers the author's reasons and undercovers sordid truths about race relations in America.  Estleman has dealt with Detroit's history thoroughly in past works, and he has also touched upon the interesting literary history of paperback pulp fiction.  Mr. Estleman is at his most effective here in A SMILE ON THE FACE OF THE TIGER.  It is a great book, and I recommend it highly.	2001-06-29

Hastings and his wife travel to a New Hampshire bed and breakfast where a series of homicides immediately begin to occur.  The local police, in the manner of the long history of cozies, mishandle every clue.  Hastings finds that he must solve the crimes in this well-plotted mystery.

He does it all within (and occasionally without)the mystery genre, and THE BURGLAR IN THE RYE is among Block's best Bernie Rhodenbarr books.  As always in a Bernie book, Block's tone is light and the mystery is fun.  For those who are not yet familiar with Bernie, he is a used book dealer who is known to moonlight as a burglar.  In this adventure, he's hired to steal letters written by a literary recluse before the letters are auctioned.  We all know the literary figure is based on a certain real-life author the moment we see the title of Block's novel.  We also know Bernie will become a murder suspect during the course of the caper.  We know too that the best cop money can buy will be investigating the crimes.  While these elements are obvious from the start, the book remains a fun and light read.  It's a good book, and I recommend it heartily.	2001-06-28

He was a member of the author panel I was moderating, and his debut mystery, BUTTERFLY LOST, had just been published.  BUTTERFLY LOST features Laura Winslow--a Ritalin-abusing, cyper-hacking, half-Hopi--protagonist.  BUTTERFLY LOST is a remarkable book because, at least to this reader, David Cole gets everything right.  His work with Native American groups has provided him with the thorough cultural knowledge he presents in his book.  Laura's computer expertise is completely convincing.  David Cole knows well of what he writes.  His plot is fast-paced and complex.  He knows the Southwestern turf well.  I cannot remember reading a more impressive debut novel.

Many of the supporting characters could also have been lifted from the classic John D. series.  SILVERSWORD opens with a shooting in San Francisco, and the plot moves swiftly from there.

Over the course of nearly two dozen books, Muller has allowed Sharon McCone to grow up and mature from a quasi-counter-culture twentysomething woman working as a PI for a nonprofit San Francisco legal clinic into the fortysomething owner of her own private investigation agency.  Muller has pulled off this transformation more convincingly than I have seen in the works of any other mystery author.<br />In LISTEN TO THE SILENCE, Muller adds fresh twists to McCone's background.  Upon the death of her father, McCone discovers why she is the only child in her family who appears to be Shoshone.  The reason is simple and obvious.  She was adopted by the McCones and her birth family's roots rest on a Native American reservation.  McCone's discovery of her adoption launches her on one of her most fascinating investigations.  I found this book engrossing, and I was once more amazed at how Marcia Muller manages to add new facets to one of the classic characters in contemporary mystery fiction.

Having appeared on the same Bouchercon World Mystery Convention panel as Ms. Marcuse when our debut novels were in initial release, I eagerly awaited her second novel.  GUILTY MIND is her second mystery, and I found it an extremely good read.  As with her first book, Ms. Marcuse captures the ambiance of the urban lifestyle of New York City.  She also continues developing her protagonist, Anita Servi.  The plot in this work revolves around the murder of her babysitter, a murder in which Anita's husband Benno becomes a suspect.  With questions of Benno's possible infidelity dogging her, Anita, a social worker, investigates the crime and undercovers all sorts of other suspects.  GUILTY MIND is a fabulous second novel.

Several other writers were on that program, and P IS FOR PERIL perfectly demonstrates why we were all so thrilled to have Sue Grafton as our keynote speaker that day.  In her latest Kinsey Millhone novel, Grafton has Kinsey hired by the ex-wife of an elderly doctor who has been missing for a number of weeks.  The physician's current wife thinks he may be dead.  While Kinsey is attempting to uncover the truth about that man's disappearance, peril cuts close to home.  She becomes involved with a pair of twins who most likely murdered their parents.  She discovers the truth about the twins, yet she also discovers she is more seriously entangled with them than she had first imagined.  Grafton's P effort is one of her best.  Her complex plot is swftly paced, and her characters continue ringing true.  It is hard to imagine how Ms. Grafton will surpass this book's quality in her Q Kinsey Millhone mystery.

Corral plays a small part, I am very much aware of the complex relationship between western and mystery fiction.  Several leading mystery writers--Loren Estleman, Elmore Leonard, and Bill Pronzini immediately come to mind--also write western fiction.  In GUNMAN'S RHAPSODY, Robert B. Parker takes on the task of writing a western.  He succeeds masterfully in his effort.  With echoes from his Spenser series echoing throughout his story, Parker's Wyatt Earp is a man who adheres to his own strict personal code of what he considers honor.  Once he arrives in Tombstone, he finds himself falling hard for a beautiful showgirl, Josie Marcus.  She's the lover of Johnny Behan, an Earp political rival, and this rivalry eventually leads to the legendary shootout.  All the usual suspects--Doc Holliday, Bat Masterson, and Johnny Ringo--play their parts in the story.  Along the way, Parker presents his interpretation of American society at that point in history.  He presents a largely lawless Tombstone split along Union/Confederate and townfolk/rancher grounds.  He shows people attempting to live their lives as they best can with the values they hold.  I have always enjoyed the Spenser series, and I enjoyed GUNMAN'S RHAPSODY.  I continue to be amazed by Robert B. Parker's writings.  He is a master working at the top of his form.	2001-06-04

A WITNESS ABOVE marks the introduction of Frank Pavlicek.  He is a Virginia private eye with a failed marriage who left the NYPD under questionable circumstances.  He is attempting to build a new life as a private cop.  His passion is falconry, and his hunting bird discovers a dead body.  Evidence indicates a connection between the victim and Frank's teenaged daughter.  The swiftly paced plot never slows from there, and Mr. Staka as written a terrific book.  It is a great debut novel.  I welcome him at the dawn of what will become a great career.	2001-06-03

MIDDLE OF NOWHERE is a strong entry in Pearson's popular Lou Boldt series.  A policewoman is assaulted during a blue flue wave, and Lou is determined to discover the identity of Maria Sanchez's attacker.  As Pearson continues the sub-plot strands that have made this series so popular, Lou struggles to solve the Sanchez assault as well as a number of other crimes, leading to additional violence.  MIDDLE OF NOWHERE is a fine book, and I continue to learn much about mystery writing by observing the way Mr. Pearson develops his plot and handles his characters.  MIDDLE OF NOWEHRE is an excellent read.	2001-06-03

In this mystery, Ms. Christmas brings her two series leads--Lady Margaret Priam and Betty Trenka--together for the first time.  By having these ladies join forces, Ms. Christmas creates an adventure that is a thoroughly entertaining read.  Each lady remains consistently in character as they solve a murder involving high-tech computing and the New York social elite.  I enjoyed this book completely, and I recommend it highly.	2001-06-03

While there were all types of debates about representative authors of other mystery sub-genres, there was no debate at all about the darkest of mystery's contemporary noir writers.  With NEVER COUNT OUT THE DEAD, Boston Teran continues to own the noir writing field.  Telling a tale of haunted and tragic characters, Teran's prose jumps off the page.  His complex plot weaves the present with past and creates a tough story of violence, manipulation, and ruthlessness centering around John Sully and Dee Storey.  If you enjoy the darkest of crime fiction, NEVER COUNT OUT THE DEAD is a book you will love.	2001-06-03

Her works are set in Miami, the Florida equivalent of my multicultural home base.  <br />Garcia-Aguilera's protagonist is Lupe Solano, the daughter of wealthy Cuban exiles.  Her father dreams of sailing his yacht home to his native Cuba following Castro's demise.  One of her sisters is a thoroughly modern nun.  Her other sister is a single mother of two.  Her assistant is her cousin Leonardo, a bodybuilder.  Her lovers are varied and numerous.<br />In BLOODY WATERS, Lupe becomes involved in the search for an illegally adopted child's biological mother.  Garcia-Aguilera's plot takes many twists and turns and becomes one of the most sophisticated first mysteries I have read in years.  It is a terrific book, and I recommend it highly.	2001-05-06

I explained that the exuberant woman was Lauren Henderson, the creator of Sam Jones.  My friend was not familiar with Ms. Henderson's work so I went on to give him a brief explanation of Lauren Henderson, Sam Jones, and Tart Noir.<br />BLACK RUBBER DRESS marks the literary debut of Sam Jones--Ms. Henderson's sassy and sexy artist/sleuth.  It also marks quite an updating of your traditional British cozy.  Actually, it invents a new sub-genre that has become known as Tart Noir.  Sam Jones is Miss Marple for our time.  She engages in casual sexual and drug use while she winnows a large field of suspects down to the actual killer.  This book is a magnificently fun read.<br />As with all Sam Jones novels, style matters as much as substance.  Sam is a true original in mystery fiction.  She is a strong, hip, and witty protagonist.  Tart Noir is one of the freshest breezes to hit crime fiction in decades, and BLACK RUBBER DRESS is one of the best examples of this sub-genre.	2001-05-06

Being a southern California-based mystery writer who has read everything Ross Macdonald wrote several times over, I was thrilled when I first heard about Tom Nolan's new effort.  Nolan's last book was the authoritative biography of Ross Macdonald, creatively entitled ROSS MACDONALD: A BIOGRAPHY.  It won last year's Macavity Award, and it should have swept the other awards.<br />STRANGERS IN TOWN is Nolan's remarkable follow-up to that magnificent biography.  It features three previously unpublished Macdonald short stories.  The stories cast new light on Macdonald, his writings, and the development of his unique talent.  Being well-versed in Macdonld's works made it possible for me to spot numerous parallels between the short stories and Macdonald's Lew Archer books.<br />While I enjoyed reading fresh works by the man I consider the greatest mystery author of all time, my favorite parts of the book were Nolan's lengthy and perceptive introduction to the collection as well as his shorter yet insightful introductions to each story.<br />STRANGERS IN TOWN is among the best books I have read this year.  It provided me with the final inspiration I needed to finish my second mystery novel.  Thank you, Tom Nolan.	2001-05-03

They deal with a territory similar to ours in many ways, yet their works have twists that distinguish the Florida works from our California mysteries.<br />Edna Buchanan is among the best of the southern Florida mystery writers, and YOU ONLY DIE TWICE is among her best works.  I love this book.  The body of a woman washes up dead, and Britt Montero, ace crime reporter, is off on her latest adventure.  The woman was supposedly murdered ten years before by her wealthy husband.  That man was convicted of the crime and is awaiting execution when his supposed victim rides the tide ashore.<br />All of the usual atypical elements of Buchanan's works are featured here.  The plot moves swiftly and veers in odd directions.  The dialog is crisp, and Miami continues in its spectacular supporting role.  New light is cast on Britt's romantic and family relationships.  This book is perfect!  Bring on the next!	2001-04-29

This week, following the revelations by the former Senator Robert Kerrey of his haunting tale from his service in Vietnam, I read O'Bien's book once more.  IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS survives the test of time.  It remains a brilliant work by one of the giants of contemporary American literature.  The ambiguities involving the disgraced political leader, the disappearance of his wife, and America's role in Southeast Asia continue to resound as powerfully today as when the novel was first written.  It is an excellent book, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.	2001-04-28

Being a debut mystery writer who splits his time between the Palm Springs area and the Southern California Orange Coast, I found myself instantly linked in the minds of many booksellers and book readers with another mystery writer, Barbara Seranella, who splits her time in a similar fashion.  Having been a devoted reader of Munch Mancini since her debut, I was pleased by the comparison.  Having recently read Ms. Seranella's latest novel, UNFINISHED BUSINESS, I couldn't be more pleased.<br />UNFINISHED BUSINESS continues the adventures of Munch Mancini, one of the stronest female protagonists in contemporary mystery fiction.  Munch, automobile mechanic and limousine driver, finds herself entangled in a murder and a rape-torture, and she tries to help her long-time friend Mace St. John investigate the crimes.  Along the way, Munch is threatened and becomes concerned with the safety of her adopted daughter.  She also must sort out her feelings concerning her current romantic interest.<br />UNFINISHED BUSINESS is an excellent book.  Barbara Seranella keeps her plot moving like a speeding locomotive.  She continues developing original characters in unique ways.  She captures in prose the Southern California lifestyle like few other writers working the turf today.<br />I recommend UNFINISHED BUSINESS without any reservations.  I am ecstatic that a geographical coincidence has gotten my work linked to hers.  Read UNFINISHED BUSINESS today!	2001-04-23

Having been a devoted reader of his Kenzie-Gennaro novels, I was extremely pleased with the comparison.  Now having read MYSTIC RIVER, I couldn't be more pleased.<br />MYSTIC RIVER is a masterpiece.  While MYSTIC RIVER remains noirish like his previous books, this stand-alone novel marks a gigantic leap forward for Lehane's writing career.  This book is the complex and densely-plotted story of three men who knew one another as boys.<br />As a youth, Dave Boyle got into a car while his friends didn't.  Upon his return, he was different and that difference destroyed his friendship with Sean Devine and Jimmy Marcus.  As adults, Sean's a policeman, Jimmy's an ex-con, and Dave's struggling through life.  Their lives are disrupted by the murder of Jimmy's daughter.  Following the homicide, each man must confront a past he is not eager to face.<br />Lehane works his story masterfully, showing once again why he is considered a true master of contemporary noir.  I recommend MYSTIC RIVER highly, and I hope readers keep comparing my work to Lehane's.	2001-04-23

We all knew that Shannon was as fine a writer as any of us, and we also knew that Shannon's strongest Jack Liffey novel was next in line for publication.<br />With THE ORANGE CURTAIN, Mr. Shannon proves his previous publisher wrong and his current publisher the luckiest publishing house on the face of the earth.  Shannon has switched publishers, shifted from paperback originals into hardcover, and delivered a masterpiece to the mystery reading community.<br />Jack Liffey, former aerospace worker, continues his new career of hunting missing children.  While his formerly comfortable life is gone, Liffey continues to hold onto his innate humanity.  This humanity is one of the ingredients I enjoy most about this series.<br />In THE ORANGE CURTAIN, Liffey's task is to locate Phuong Minh, a Vietnamese bookseller's daughter.  During his search, Liffey finds himself tangling with gang violence, corrupt politics, and the ethnic tranformation of contemporary Southern California.  Little Saigon exists in Orange County because of America's Southeast Asian adventure and echoes of that war from a third of a century ago reverberate throughout this novel.  During the course of his story, Shannon delivers explosive action, social observations, and humor as he builds to a magnificent climax.<br />As a mystery writer who deals with similar themes in similar Orange County settings, I can vouch for the fact that John Shannon has mastered his material.  He has gotten it right.  THE ORANGE CURTAIN will likely be his breakthrough book.  Shannon deserves it.  His readers deserve it.  Justice is done.	2001-04-14

Jefferson Parker.  As the author of a recently published mystery set in Orange County, I had the privilege of speaking to our Balboa Bay Club audience immediately before Mr. Parker.  During my talk, I stated that Jeff Parker is the author who has taught all the rest of us Orange County mystery writers how to write about our unique region of Southern California.<br />SILENT JOE continues to prove my point.  It is a marvelously complex mystery that is Parker's strongest book to date.  It will move him securely into the major league of crime fiction writers with the likes of Sue Grafton, Robert Crais, Sara Paretsky, and Robert B. Parker.  In its complexity, it even reminds me of the works of the genre's immortals such as Hammett, Chandler, and Macdonald.<br />Joe Trona was scarred for life by an acid attack at the hands of his biological father.  He is adopted and nurtured by Will Trona, a local politico.  When Joe grows up, he aspires to a career in law enforcement.  He works in the Orange County jail and moonlights as driver/bodyguard for Will Trona.  Will Trona is murdered.  Joe wants to avenge the murder of the man who contributed the most to the person he has become.  During his investigation, Silent Joe finds himself entangled in the kidnapping of a tycoon's daughter, the murder of two Latino immigrants, and a political corruption scheme.  He uncovers long-bured secrets involving Will and himself.<br />SILENT JOE is an extraordinary work by an extraordinary author.

During my talk, I stated that Jeff Parker is the author who, through his writings, has taught all the rest of us Orange County mystery writers how to write about that unique region of Southern California.<br />I believe Parker's RED LIGHT proves my point perfectly.  While continuing the story of Merci Rayborn, first introduced in Parker's BLUE HOUR, this novel captures the essence of the Orange County social milieu excellently.  While spinning a tale involving Merci's inner struggles as she continues to mourn the death of her former partner and father of her child, raise that child, and build a romantic relationship with a fellow officer, Parker manages to show his readers what it is like to live in the Orange County of today while reminding those same readers about life in Orange County during those years not too long ago when the county was dominated by political extremism.<br />In RED LIGHT, Merci is confronted by the murder of a young prostitute.  Her current boyfriend may be involved in that murder.  The murder may also be linked to a similar murder of a prostitute back in the sixties.  A number of people important to Merci may be connected to that previous homicide.  Merci has to discover the truth and decide how to react to that truth.<br />RED LIGHT is an extraordinary work by an extraordinary writer.  It fully deserves all the recognition it has received, including its recent EDGAR nomination.  With every book he writes, Jeff Parker continues to show the rest of us Orange County mystery writers how to write about Orange County.  Great book!	2001-04-11

As an author of a recently published mystery, I genuinely admire the work of Robert B. Parker.  After nearly thirty Spenser books in as many years, Parker's Spenser series remains consistently fresh, and, in Potshot, it gets even better.  In this latest novel, Spenser is Spenser, with his  unique style, wit, and attitude.  He is hired by a lovely widow and sets his sights on cleaning up an Arizona town.  To accomplish his goal, Spenser enlists the help of a number of supporting characters from recent books.  Parker's sidekick concept is a stroke of brilliance by a master of the mystery genre.  Potshot has everything that his readers have grown to expect from Spenser and then some.  Parker and Spenser keep walking the walk and talking the talk.  Fast plot.  Clever quips.  Social observations.  Well-researched ambience.  I hope my work can remain as solid as Mr. Parker's after my next thirty books!	2001-03-19

I believe this novel is one of his strongest in recent years.  As always, Hillerman captures the essence of the multicultural American Southwest with its ongoing blending of cultures. He also presents the cultural depth of the indigenous cultures that reach back to before recorded history.  The plot involves the robbery of a tribal casino and the events that stem from that crime.  The legendary Joe Leaphorn, bored in retirement, is drawn into the investigation as Jim Chee finds himself involved in investigating the case.  All the expected characters appear in the novel, and Hillerman does an excellent job of allowing these characters to continue to grow even after so many books stretching over so many years.  Leaphorn is adjusting to his new life, sans his job and his late wife.  Chee is putting his latest romantic disappointment behind him.  Both men are experiencing fresh romances in their lives, and their friendship begins to reach new levels.  As he allows character, plot, and theme to play out, Hillerman tells a fabulous story.  Hunting Badger should not be missed.  It is one of Tony Hillerman's finest.	2001-02-04
