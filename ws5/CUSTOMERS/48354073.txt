If you want to understand the IRA, the bombings in GB and Belfast, and the current difficulties of negotiating disarmament, this is a good place to start.<br /><br />However, unfortunately, the characters are overblown to the point of becoming positively silly - this is history as soap opera.  At the center, you have Conor:  not only is he a stunningly handsome and totally dedicated revolutionary, but he is a poet as well as blacksmith of genius.  He falls for a protestant (forbidden!), then a fellow catholic, while attracting a chief protagonist rich woman admirer whom he uses.  Then there are the evil aristocrats, etc etc.  (One of them is jealous of his wife's obsession with her father, yet doesn't bring it up for over 30 years and instead tries to destroy her covertly, all because she called to her father while giving birth and not him. Whew!)  This greatly detracts from the quality of the reading experience and simply isn't believable after a while.  There just isn't any subtlty in it.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there are moving parts of the story, and I learned a lot of history - or at least was provoked.  REcommended with these caveats in mind.	2005-09-25

Indeed, this book tapped into my sense of wonder as few have in recent years, the mystery of life and how our beliefs shape our world as we struggle to make sense of it all and move ahead.  As such, this book for me was a complete success, just a delight to experience - I could suspend my disbelief and simply savor it, hooked into the characters, their issues, their compromises and little triumphs.  That makes for a superior novel.  It tickled my imagination and gave me images that I will never forget, no matter how weird or unbelievable some of them might be.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.	2005-09-24

So far as it goes, this is a useful message, but I must say that - in spite of the veneer that cognitive neuroscience offered by the authors - there is nothing very original in this book.  It does have exercises to think beyond one's standard views and some advice on advancing revolutionary ideas into an organization, but I feel that the reader can find these types of suggestions in innumerable other books already available.  THe only difference is the vocabulary employed here (\\"impossible thinking\\" rather than \\"paradigm shifting\\" or \\"thinking out of the box\\" or \\"tapping creative blah blah\\") and, of course, the way it is written (which isn't bad).<br /><br />As such, I can only tepidly recommend this book.  Moreover, at the risk of sounding arrogant, I am used to thinking out of the box already and so did not need any of this.	2005-09-19

While Wills has been criticized as a non-specialist in these reviews, in many ways I found that an asset in this book.  It is beautifully written - he has a uniquely clear and flowing style of writing that is a continual pleasure for me - and as he presents the essence of the many subjects he wishes to cover, he rarely gets bogged down in detail.  In addition, many of the things that he investigates are wonderful surprizes for non-specialized readers such as myself (e.g. that the body of St. Mark was stolen by Venetians and set up in a shrine to establish the legitimacy of the city's unusual political culture).<br /><br />THe book is organized in several theme sections.  First, in Imperial Disciplines, there are the historical origins and unique structure of this Renaissance state, which allowed it to escape the power struggles that dogged medieval Italy, i.e. unlike the innumerable city states re-fought the same territorial battles every generation under different egomaniacs.  Second, in Imperial Personnel, Wills looks at the various members of society, from the frozen aristocracy (built on the expectation of duty rather than priviledge) to the workers who made the city's arsenal such as great and unique strategic asset as well as the \\"outsiders,\\" such as the Jews (the word \\"ghetto,\\" we learn, was coined for Venetian brass foundaries); how the state functioned, who held power and how it was exercised (in a diffused bureaucratic balance), are expertly described while avoiding the heaviness of a comprehensive history.  Third, in Imperial Piety, there is the religious iconography and ritual, which in part allowed Venetians the sense of legitimacy they needed to defy Rome and the Pope over centuries.  As I am quite ignorent of Christian history, this was fascinating and valuable for me, e.g. that St George was a Christianized Hercules, who also \\"fought\\" the many plagues that inevitably arose in the Venetian environment.  Finally, in Imperial Learning, there is the Renaissance scholarship that came late to the city, and how it altered the art, politics, book scholarship, and the like - all set in geo-political context.  Throughout - and sometimes with too much descriptive detail for me - Wills interprets the art and architecture of Venice in light of these themes.  The result is simply dazzling, in my view, a masterwork by a great populariser and philosophical moralist.<br /><br />At any rate, this was exactly what I was looking for, and from reading many of WIlls' books, what I expected.  It is not for graduate-level academics, but rather for those well informed on European history who are curious to learn more on Venice.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.ng, there is the Renaissance scholarship that came late to the city, and how it altered the art, politics, book scholarship, and the like - all set in geo-political context.

There is no reporting in it whatsoever and even the ideas covered (or concluded?) are obscured by jargon and, well, rather poor writing.<br /><br />The story itself is relevant for business analysts, activists, and interested observers.  In 1996, after consultation with the British government, Royal Dutch Shell decided that it would dispose of a massive oil storage and loading platform (Brent Spar) at sea.  While the method represented a new way of decommissioning such a platform, it appeared both scientifically and environmentally sound as well as cheap.  What Shell managers did not count on was the campaign that GreenPeace developed against the company that was based on some dodgy conclusions:  not only did the group call for a massive boycott - mostly in Germany! - but activists occupied the platform and were repelled (on TV naturally) by water cannons.  The result was the worst kind of brand trashing that is imaginable for a major corporation, while GreenPeace gained huge publicity for its cause of environmentalism (and fundraising therefor).  SHell may have had the science right, but the way it dealt with the crisis as GreenPeace engineered it was utterly disastrous.  Eventually, Brent Spar was recycled on shore and SHell admitted activits to its panels for consultation, widening the voices heard as well as attempting to re-vamp its decisionmaking process (making it more centralized and hence less dependent on local technocrats).<br /><br />Now that is pretty interesting stuff.  Alas, this book is precisely the wrong place to learn about it!<br /><br />Not recommended except for political scientists in the author's peer group.	2005-09-08

WHat this requires, the author argues, is a willingness by companies to look for new solutions (in product design, the creation of both traditional and information infrastructures, the involvement of potential consumers, and the like) rather than merely adapting products that were developed for other markets.  While simple, there is much merit to this approach, which should empower the poor to get involved in the economic system as well as generate returns for companies.<br /><br />WHile I cannot do justice to Prahalad's model, which is presented in the first part of the book, there is much of it that deserves scrutiny.  He argues that corporations need to adapt many of their basic methods and assumptions to these markets, throwing out many aspects of the conventional wisdom.  FOr example, corporations must be willing to offset lower-profit margins with the huge potential demand that underdeveloped markets exhibit - this turns competitive advantage on its head, as many corporations would seek to get out of such \\"commoditized\\" markets once profit margins per product begins to drop.  Corporations must also spend more time educating potential consumers in such areas as personal hygiene, which requires partnerships with health officials, etc.  (That was to promote handwashing as a way to prevent diarrhea, which is a major killer of children in the 3-W.)  While his ideas do not add up to a coherent model, they are diverse enough to be useful to those who are contemplating market entry in 3-W countries.<br /><br />The second half of the book has case studies that illustrate Prahalad's ideas.  This was a far weaker part of the book:  the stories are rather poorly written, often the concepts that drive the businesses are unclear, and even the explanations (of what the core innovations were) are hard to follow.  Nonetheless, there are many interesting nuggets of info in them, if the reader has the time to plow thru them.  There is also a supplemental cd-rom, which I found almost completely useless for those who want to get at the ideas quickly - they are amateurish and do not encapsulate the book's ideas independently of the book's text, but rather supplement it.  And poorly at that.<br /><br />Finally, while I am sure that these stories helped a lot of people, nothing is put forward to argue that the cases are anything more than isolated incidents - is this really significant, I wondered?  How will it diffuse in the overall economy? When?  What else must be done?  These macro-questions are wholly unanswered and yet, I feel, crucial for anyone who might want to get involved in this approach.<br /><br />REcommended as food for thought.are hard to follow.

White was entirely self-made, an energetic and talented man who had some luck but mostly worked very hard.<br /><br />Although many journalists came to scorn White for his nostalgic style late in life - rightfully in my opinion - there is no doubt that early on he was a great reporter of courage and idealism.  You see him begin reporting for Luce (and Time) while on a fellowship in China, fresh out of Harvard, when he got into the innermost circle of communist leaders after becoming disillusioned with Chiang Kai Shek.  There he met Mao, Zhou EnLai, and scores of others who would go on to great power - the reader feels like he gets to know them personally.  He then wrote a bestseller on the experience.<br /><br />In a typical move that showed his nose for a great story and a pioneer of in-depth investigations, White then moved to Paris, where he chronicled the post-war reconstruction under the Marchall Plan.  He then returned to the US and started his outstanding series on US elections, the Making of the President.  After losing a job at Colliers, and at great financial risk, he made his living almost entirely from books.<br /><br />This is a amazing and trailblazing career, thick with historical detail, but this book is also a memoir that lets you in on what made him tick:  he witnessed his father beaten down by the Depression, but heard from him that China would have a revolution that would change the world.  This was the source of his original inspiration for China.  There are many asides that are both charming and fascinating, such as the time he lost his virginity in China, but also about how he works and what he remembers of certain scenes, such as the moment Zhou EnLai got him to eat pork.<br /><br />Warmly recommended, in particular for aspiring writers (like myself when I read it!)..	2005-09-05

What is odd for me is that he acts like the the true import of these ideas was uncovered by him.<br /><br />What he explores are how ideas catch on (or \\"tip\\"), which he likens to an epidemic.  First, there is the law of the few, that is, only a handful of people are the source of some new fashion or fascination (e.g. using hair stylists to disseminate ideas of women's health to heir clients).  Second, these ideas have a certain \\"stickiness,\\" some quality to them that makes them stick in our minds in exceptional ways (e.g. the Wendy's ad with \\"where's the beef?\\").  Third, the ideas appear in and are influencd by a certain context (e.g. the poor neighborhoods in Baltimore, where syphalis was spread).<br /><br />Then, Gladwell argues, there are three types of people who are the actors in tipping points:  1) connectors, who know the right people to tell in networks of their creation; 2) mavens that thrive on finding and passing on special knowledge; 3) salesmen, who are uniquely qualified to transmit their enthusiasms (or what they are selling) with emotion.<br /><br />That is it for the ideas, and Gladwell writes about them beautifully.  The rest of the book is filled with examples from these phenomena, often reported in wonderful detail that is both quirky and informative.<br /><br />As a business writer, I can say that there is not much new in what he has to say.  We employ these notions in our study of marketing, though sometimes under different names, such as \\"buzz\\" marketing.  What Gladwell has done is articulate them better than we have for a wider audience, and that is exactly what a great journalist/populariser should do.  While his tone as a \\"discoverer\\" was off-putting to me, perhaps it is because I am a bit jaded by my profession as a business writer.<br /><br />There is also a lot of speculation on psychology that the reader can agree or diagree with, such as Gladwell's contention - now popular with congitive neuroscientists - that peer groups influence the develop of a child's personality more than parents.  I admit, as a parent, that I find that ludicrous, but then I am biased I suppose.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very interesting read that I would recommend warmly.

Wolf is a good writer, has worked in international organizations on economic development issues, and is currently economics editor of the Financial Times.<br /><br />He really goes over the basics here, without excessive resort to math, from how the global economy works, why it in his view is best, and what should be done to improve its performance.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is that Wolf acknowledges rather than glosses over the problems of inequality, the corruption, poor performance, or deformation of certain international economic institutions, and the critiques of the young.  While his tone is sometimes defensive (he despises Naomi Kline and the young anti-globalists), he makes an honest attempt to argue that there is amply room for improvement in the way the political economy is run.<br /><br />Wolf's views are very close to my own, so what I got from this book is a solid overview of the issues as they stand at the moment.  I did not need convincing, so this may be more useful for those who are asking basic questions and are more open-minded than myself.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-09-02

Unlike Hibbert's more superficial (and better knwon) The Medicis, the author had gone directly for original sources as a scholar rather than secondary literature as a hack.  The result is a wonderful read, if at times a bit difficult for the assumptions it made on knowledge of the history and governmental mechanics of the papacy, the unification of Spain, etc; there are also quotes in Latin, Spanish, French and Italian that are not translated, and I for one do not know those languages well enough as a would-be scholar.  But he can also tell a very good story.<br /><br />The tale of the Borgias was quite surprizing to me:  I had assumed that they were the same as other powerful Italian princes of the era, rising through business and/or the military seizure of territory as condottieri.  Not so!  They were Spanish and rose from obscurity as a direct result of gaining the papacy - as a compromise candidate between the factions of Venice, Florence, and Spain.  The first Borgia pope (Callistus III) then appointed many of his relatives to positions of temporal and religious power, where they enriched themselves and learned the ropes in the most brutal of apprenticeships.  Then, with the second pope (ALEXANDER VI) - whose illegitimate, sociopathic son Cesare (by a well known courtesan while he was a prominent Cardinal!) served as the instrument of his will - they made a remarkable rise, only to witness their empire collapse like that of countless other princes, in part due to the vindictineness of Julius II (yes, Micelangelo's patron for the Sistine ceiling).  It is utterly fasciniating in the hands of this master writer, with such characters as Lorenzo de Medici, Alfonso d'Este, Fra Bartolemo, Louis XII of France, and Machiavelli.  Moreover, the author openly defends the Borgias and argues that many of the stories about them were sleazy propaganda from their enemies that failed to comprehend their progressivist attempts to unify Italy (Cesare acknowledged he was a tyrant because he had to remove tyrants).<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This isn't easy reading, but it is accessible enough to the interested lay reader, a seriously meaty history, and wonderfully informative and beautifully written.t attempts to unify Italy (Cesare acknowledged he was a tyrant because he had to remove tyrants).

Perhaps my expectations were too high - this is supposed to be one of America's most distinguished novelists - but I did not find this engaging, perceptive, or poignant in the slightest.  It is occasionally funny, but more because of grotesque and exaggerated circumstances than because of any subtle ironies.<br /><br />I mean, the guy was horny, had a weird mother, and married a nerdy academic while writing.  THere are transsexuals and all sorts of unrealistic characters.  Beyond feminism, it also doesn't reflect the historical period (Vietnam, race riots, etc.) so doesn't evoke the panorama of American life.  This was profoundly disappointing to me.  I guess I expected something deeper and more perceptive and thoughtful.  This was none of those.<br /><br />Not recommended, except for slapstick laughs.	2005-07-25

Revel writes with an astonishing lucidity and clarity about one of the great diseases of nationalism in the industrial era, totalitarianism.  In a nutshell, Revel argues that the monopolization of the media and the means of enforcing obedience (in lieu of maintaining safety and liberty) represents the great temptation for tyrants who wish to change societies quickly and on a mass scale.  While Revel does not add much in terms of academic theory to this debate, his book adds journalistic detail and lucid arguments in a way that is easy to read for those interested but not ready to crack Hanna Ardnt's big books on the subject.  Revel's treatment was also politically relevant, as the time in which it was written there was still much debate about whether the USSR was better equipped to help more people more quickly than were liberal democracies.  This book does not have the biting sarcasm and cynicism of his wonderful Without Jesus or Marx, but it offers a more focused and coherent argument against this brand of dictatorship.<br /><br />REcommended as a cautionary tale as well as an interesting view into the Cld War mentality as it was in the 1970s.	2005-07-25

As a financial advisor, Bernstein knows all about the former, which he can explain in layman terms to the latter.  The result is a truly brilliant book.<br /><br />According to Bernstein, our notion of risk occured in 3 stages.  It began in the 16th C, when Renaissance mathematicians turned their attention to Earth, a major departure from the preoccupations of philosophers since antiquity, who studied the motions of the planetary bodies as the only measurable regularities in nature.  The new guys studied dice and other games of chance as well as bookkeeping and the insurance industry (i.e. useful to the rising bourgoisie).  This represented a revolution in our notion of fate, he says, as the future was regarded more as something human beings could master and manipulate regardless of their birth station, etc.<br /><br />FOr the next 200 years, Bernstein reports, mathematicians attempted to measure, with rapidly evolving tools (physical and conceptual), what they believed could be \\"known\\" with certainty.  Pascal and Fermat formulated the general rules for the calculation of probabilities, which was the first real step in the science of risk management, that is, recognising that math rules could guide decisions about the future.  Bernstein argues that this signalled the birth of the modern era, in which rational planning replaced mystics and numerologists.<br /><br />This was the golden age of classical statistics.  First, researchers examined what could be inferred of the whole from a limited number of observations (statistical inference, as in vote sampling today).  Then, they turned their gaze to uncertainty, which they might estimate.  This resulted in Bayes' theorem, which incorporates intuition into the equasion.  THe bell curve was also discovered.<br /><br />I found Bernstein's third stage the most interesting, i.e. post-WWI.  This was a time when the confidence in Western rationalism came into question, not only whether we operate logically but if we even come to the right conclusions when armed with the \\"required\\" information.  At this time, the science of risk breaks into a number of competing schools, whose arguments are mutually exclusive, including game theory.<br /><br />FInally, Bernstein offers up some surprisingly skeptical financial advice.  Investment professionals, we learn, rarely do consistently better than random choices (!) and if they develop a system that works, it will quickly become obsolete because others will copy it.<br /><br />This book is an extremely useful review of the complicated, sometimes arcane techniques that many of us sweated through during late nights a grad student toil.  I hated every minute of it, but in Bernstein's hands it is indeed facsinating and written with a remarkable clarity.  Berstein makes a lively case for the judicious use of this risk-analysis techniques - we should take them into account even if we fail to follow them rationally.  His book is a useful primer for investor caution, i.e. quantitative techniques are useful but should be questioned continually.  There are also innumerable fascinating asides, in which personal details of the mathematicians are examined with humor and psychological depth.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.is was a time when the confidence in Western rationalism came into question, not only whether we operate logically but if we even come to the right conclusions when armed with the \\"required\\" information.

I liked Ellie, the chief protagonist, who was psychologically complex and a striver for discovery - she had a funny relationship with her father and step father, which influenced her ability to get close to men, perhaps focusing her on the search for intelligent life.  Of course, she makes a great discovery and then fights the bureaucracy to get a chance to travel to the new beings with the technology that they transmit.  Then of course there is the journey and the disappointing reactions of mankind, etc.  THis is a solid and believable plot.<br /><br />That is fine so far as it goes.  Somehow, it just felt static to me, rather than pulsing with the life that a novel by Octavia Butler or even Frank Herbert does.  Perhaps it is because I regard the best hard scifi as genuinely great novels that I found this so mediocre.  The characters are more vehicles for ideas than living beings, perhaps, or they just weren't all that interesting outside of their amazing adventure.<br /><br />Tepidly recommended.

Along the way, he influences Nietzsche, who was his acolyte as a young man.<br /><br />The ideas are indeed very fun.  At first, Wagner was a kind of utopist anarchist and took part in the revolutions of 1848.  He believed that art could fundamentally change society for the better, and that human life was perfectable through politics.  Free love and the destruction of convention were the rule here.  It was at this time that he conceived the Ring and wrote its entire libretto.  His revolutionary involvement led directly to his exile in Switzerland, where he met Nietzsche and the two began long talks on art and life.  This was when Wagner discovered Schopenhauer and disengaged from his earlier activism in favor of an almost buddhist detachment.  While he never changed this attitude, he did decisively influence Nietzsche, whose later philosophy is largely a rebellion against Wagner and Schopenhauer.  This is a lot of meaty fare to cover and I greatly enjoyed it while getting a wonderful perspective on the work of this truly unique artist.  While he kept the first two operas of the Ring, his philosophical shift influenced his artistic conceptions so deeply that he wrote the music to the last two parts of the Ring with far greater emphasis on the music.  He saw the myth in a new way, and (unconsciously) consistent with his early intention on another level, while contradicating his earlier writings on what it meant.  That is what a genius does.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in spite of this great illumination into the development of one of the greatest artists of all time, I grew very tired of Magee's pretentions at being a philosophical writer.  In my reading, his work simply reeks of a kind of Oxbridge intellectual snobbism in only the way a Brit can show off his erudition.  I know too many guys who speak like he writes, so this is perhaps just a personal bugaboo of mine.  Nonetheless, Magee's reasoning should become a must-read amoungst Wagernian devotees, and he is recognised as a very good scholar on Schopenhauer.<br /><br />Alas, there is also the \\"rigor\\" of Magee's reasoning, which I found equally tedious (as a non-philosopher).  There is a massive section on why Nietzsche turned against Wagner in later life, in which he finally concludes that Nietzsche was insulted by Wager's inquiries in his masturbatory practices (!) and also how Wagner destroyed a career path (in music!) that Nietzsche might have taken.  Then, there is a long appendix on Wagner's anti-semitism, which I could barely skim.  Only an over-the-top intellectual could think he needs to logically reconcile all the stuff he tries to, such as how a genius like Nietzsche could fail to grasp the genius of Wagner's later operas.  I think that humans are illogical hypocrites too busy to lead their live and reconcile thier every utterance and judgment with total logical cogency.  I mean, contrary to several anguished British academics that I know, I have never found it \\"shocking\\" that Nazis liked high culture and yet could be sadistic savages.<br /><br />So I feel ambivalent about this book.

Just the chapter on his step-father - an angry, brilliant, difficult man - is worth the price of admission.  Beyond the black experience, everyone who has fought with a tough dad will empathise with Baldwin.  Then there is a piece on living in France as a young writer, again it is unbelievably dense, funny, and moving, a true masterpiece of the genre of autobiographical essays.  His style is so cool and clear, so icily brilliant, that any aspiring writer can study the style, as did I.<br /><br />This book, in my opinion, has Baldwin's best work in it, of a quality that earns him a place in the literary canon.  The essays really are far far better than any of his novels, in my opinion.  While some of them are less than excellent journalistic pieces (A Fly in the Buttermilk about school integration), the best ones are, well, the best.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.	2005-07-13

Having been seeded long long before, this colony had lost touch with the home world and developed a culture of its own, highly civilised and quite benign - they are peaceful and pursue their pleasures in an open and innocent way.  However, underneath their oceans, an incredible transformation is taking place, perhaps one of the most significant in the history of the human race.  Then the fleeing ships arrives, shaking things up with new ideas and desires.  While avoiding spectacular adventure, this quiet novel is quite fascinating and chock full of intricately related ideas and systems, which are what Clarke portrays the best.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.

I can't say that I got much of anything out of this book, but as far as it went it wasn't too bad. What she is trying to do is portray her affair as a good rather than a dishonorable or bad thing.

While it has much in common with the radical critique of capitalism in No Logo, it is more focused, the reporting and research are far better, and the conclusions are more balanced.<br /><br />As I see it, Schlosser makes a number of interesting points:<br /><br />1) fast food companies, with McDo in the lead, pioneered marketing to kids, perhaps establishing brand loyalties and eating patterns by the age of 2.<br /><br />2) The hire adoloscents, who are easier to control and at lower wages than an older and more permanent work force; hire turnover is used to cut back benefits, etc.  The system in the restos is highly regimented for efficiency and control.<br /><br />3) The business model is the franchise, which allows the creation of semi-independent businesses with federal subsdies and at low risk to the massive corporations that help them while allowing them the freedom to be entreprensurs (i.e. to work extremely hard and pay royalties).<br /><br />4) The food, virtually all of which is processed and hence loses flavor, would taste bad if not for chemical additives for smell, etc.<br /><br />5) The supply system is increasingly subsumed into absolutely massive industrial combines that promote the use of unskilled labor, creating a new immigrant industrial underclass with high injury rates and few benefits.<br /><br />6) The industrial methods, in particular in slaughterhouses, create an ideal system for the transmission of dangerous new pathogens via contamination with excrement, etc.  They are also fed meat products from other animals.<br /><br />7) The USDA is weakened and virtually industinguishable form the meat industry.<br /><br />8) The fast food industry has become a symbol of US power.<br /><br />9) While the link to obesity is not scientifically proven, fast food companies contribute to the rise in numbers of, well, fat people.<br /><br />Each of these points can be criticised, in particular as some companies - like McDo, in my opinion and as implied in Schlosser's - manage these issues better and with genuine concern for health and safety in many instances.  While I recognised many inaccuracies (McDo burgers are not artificially flavored, for example), my lack of knowledge makes it hard to evaluate many of these points, which as a reporter stimulates me to inquire and learn more.  (Indeed, from what I have learned of McDo, I have more repect for the company than if I read only this.)<br /><br />Moreover, the problems do not necessarily originate with the fast food companies themselves, but reflect deeper trends in our societies, which the companies accentuate and exploit but do not create exclusively on their own (e.g. the paving of nature areas for malls).  This is all stimulaitng and gets the reader to deeply question what we are doing.  I find disturbing that, as Schlosser contends, we pay less for many things because the costs are reflected elsewhere in our society and economy - this is a disturbing trend, as refected in Walmart forcing their workers to rely on medicaid at taxpayer expense.<br /><br />Schlosser offers some specific suggestions, including a ban on advertising to kids; encouragement of unionisation; and enhancing USDA and consolidating food-industry regulatory agencies.  It is worthy to consider them.<br /><br />Politicaly speaking, Schlosser also arrives at some useful conclusions.  Fast food companies are businesses and hence will respond to consumer pressure.  THe businessmen that run them are smart and will make changes in their practices faster than legislators can.  FInally, that means it is up to us to choose what kind of society we want to have.  I have seen all of these trends operating at McDonald's - it has the market power and uses it when it sees it as necessary.  This is enlightened self-interest, which means that the market is a useful tool for changing a society and can be used judiciouslyby protesters, though in itself the market has few values beyond profit-seeking.  Schlosser is right to advocate for this kind of pressure and approach for change in my opinion.<br /><br />Warmly recommended. Overall, this is truly a superb book that will get readers to ask themselves lots of questions.society and can be used judiciously by protesters, though in itself the market has few values beyond profit-seeking.

What makes it very fun is the way he critiques the ideas of others while telling stories and analysing their perspective.  If you want a critical vantage on sociobiology, this is a great place to start.  You can also read a wonderful review of Turning Point by Frijof Capra, which Gould finds wanting because it is full of assertions that are ultimately unproven.  I would agree, but I did see a lot of merit in Capra's ideas of holistic science as well, which represented a precurser to complexity theory.  Then there is Gould's trenchent critique of Jeremy Rifkin, whom he says lacks integrity because of his scientific sloppiness and the tendentiousness of his many errors - interesting because one would imagine they would be on the same side on many issues.  Through it all, Gould appears as a tolerant spirit, advancing his perspective while respecting that of others with a critical gaze.<br /><br />Of course, there is Gould's inimitable style:  so graceful and flowing that each is like a succulent hors d'oeuvre or some variety of Turkish delight.

Though it is somewhat dated, this book will set the standard for every deep inquiry into how McDonald's operates.  It is simply a remarkable story.<br /><br />In 1954, salesman Ray Kroc had traveled from Chicago to San Bernardino, California to visit a local restaurant, which was called \\"McDonald's Famous Hamburgers\\".  Its owners had bought 8 of his Multimixers; with five spindles, he calculated, those Multimixers could churn out 40 milkshakes every few minutes.  Why, he wondered, did they need so many?  Arriving just prior to the restaurant's opening, Kroc parked his car outside, and waited for customers to arrive.  What he saw left him thunderstruck:  it was like an assembly line for food that was affordable, good-tasting, and fast.  The restaurant was also very clean, the service friendly.  Kroc spent that evening with the owner-creators of restaurant, Mac and Dick McDonald, discussing the mechanics of their system.  The following day, with a business plan in his mind, Kroc secured the exclusive right from the McDonald brothers to franchise their fast-food system in the U.S.  Irrepressibly optimistic, Kroc was 52 and a veteran of several ventures in the food industry.<br /><br />McDonald's was not the first fast-food restaurant chain:  there was A&W Root Beer, Dairy Queen, and scores of others.  Each depended on the use of the automobile, in which suburban families could travel to obtain a convenient and inexpensive meal in a clean setting.  As part of the contract with the McDonald brothers, Kroc had agreed to follow the basic model of their original restaurant, though changes could be approved in writing.  (That would prove an enormous problem later on.)  Where Kroc differed from his competitors was in the franchise system that he created.  His approach was long-term, based on what he judged to be equitable relationships with suppliers and the owner/operators of McDonald's franchises. Not seeking to make a quick profit, he charged relatively lower startup fees from carefully selected franchisees.  Kroc's business model included:<br /><br />1) A gradual, restaurant-by-restaurant expansion to maintain control over restaurant standards and design;<br /><br />2) Owner/operators who were expected to act as local entrepreneurs and were directly involved in the management of the individual restaurant;<br /><br />3) The development of supplier relationships based on trust and the promise of future growth together;<br /><br />4) A relentless focus on experimentation to enhance operational efficiency;<br /><br />5) Consistent training and monitoring of personnel to maintain the company's philosophy of QSC&V (quality, service, cleanliness, and value).<br /><br />Profits of the McDonald's chain came as a direct percentage of its franchisees' gross sales.  While certain aspects of the model were tweaked - from the early 1960s, corporate revenues came to be based largely on leasing fees from franchisees on McDonald's property - Kroc's basic structure and practices survived.  As Kroc wrote:  \\"My belief was that I had to help the individual operator succeed...His success would insure my success.\\"  The same logic applied to his suppliers.<br /><br />For their part, McDonald's competitors tended to treat their franchisees like captive customers rather than trusted partners.  For example, Dairy Queen and Tastee Freeze became suppliers to their franchisees, forcing them to buy equipment and other products at a profit for the corporate offices, in effect creating a structural conflict of interest.  Not only did this divert the attention of the central headquarters from maintaining the quality and operational efficiency of their restaurants, but it frequently led to price gouging for less than optimal equipment, which undermined the loyalty of franchisees over the long term.  Moreover, they sold \\"territorial franchises\\" for huge initial profits to local businessmen, relinquishing control over large geographical areas, which often led to the neglect of standards and brand consistency.  Finally, their relations with outside suppliers tended to be short-term, based more on cost savings than on quality or innovation within the system.<br /><br />Over time, the McDonald's chain grew up as a kind of ecosystem or coalition of partners, in which the interests of its members - the central headquarters, the owner/operators, and the suppliers - coincided over the long term.  Suppliers were also encouraged to innovate:  to perfect the pre-frozen french fry, for example, Fred Simplot invested over $3.5 million (!) of his own funds; as a reward (upon success), the Simplot Company grew into the world's largest supplier of potato products.  In the same way, it was owner/operators who invented some of the most popular new menu items, including the Big Mac, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich, and the Egg McMuffin, which eventually were offered in all McDonald's restaurants.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book does not go much beyond this promising beginning.  While this made for a cohesive system that was self-reinforcing and -improving, it also complicated the task of managing it from the national headquarters of the McDonald's Corporation.  For any new policy, McDonald's execs have to convince franchisees and suppliers that it is in their interest to implement it.  As the saying goes, \\"if it doesn't happen in the restaurants, it doesn't happen.\\"  For years, the company reacted to outside pressures, though this is now changing with new proactive policies.<br /><br />Furthermore, as McDonald's grew into the world's largest restaurant chain and indeed into a cultural force, it became a lightening rod for criticism.  The accusations of activists have taken a heavy toll on the McDonald's brand.  For example, McDonald's had become a specific target of anti-globalist vandalism during the 1999 meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle.  Other critics included Jose Bove, the organic farmer who achieved world renown for his role in the destruction of a McDonald's restaurant in the French countryside.  Finally, for many the moniker \\"Mc\\" had become synonymous not only with low quality and cheapness, but also with the American form of capitalism.  This represents a reversal of the wholesome, family-oriented image that the company had long nurtured.<br /><br />The company is struggling to deal with these challenges to its brand at the moment.  Even more important, the company's strategy for growth - just planting more and more restaurants - has ceased to function as well as it used to:  there are too many McDo outlets so they compete with eachother in addition to other brands.  Now, the company is attempting to attract new customers and get old ones to buy more at each visit.  While this is working with menu changes for healthier fare (which mothers, many of whom did not like the old menu, feel good about buying when they come with their kids) these issues represent major challenge for the future, in particular the distrust of the brand that has become almost visceral.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this book covers the basics, to about the mid 1980s, with genuine excellence.

It is fascinating in that you see how influence and genuine good intentions can lead to disaster and alienation when you are dealing with different cultures.  The specifics are well known:  during the COld War, Iran and the SHah were seen as US allies.  However, Iranian society was also seeking to evolve in its own ways, hence the early revolution with Mossadegh that was overthrown with the help of the CIA; while a tactical victory, the underlying process of change could not be entirely thwarted.  The Shah then believed he had a free hand to mold the society as he saw fit, with full US support.  We viewed him as an indispenable ally, and so trusted him while lending economic support. Of course, the Shah had his own designs, including the founding of OPEC, obviously not \\"in the interest\\" of the West.  Then, with his new-found resources, the Shah was like a kid in a candy store, going bananas buying weapons systems - Kissinger saw him as a \\"regional policeman\\" - while repressing his people.  All the changes happened too fast, and the backlash of fundamentalism was the result.  Rubin's perspective demonstrates that chaging someone else's society is a perilous undertaking.  This is a relevant message today.<br /><br />Rubin writes well and does a wonderful analysis of all this, which makes this a great cautionary tale for naively good intensions interlaced with geo-politics.  While the book ends at the time of the Revolution, it is a superb introduction to the politics and history of Iran.<br /><br />Warmly recomended.	2005-07-05

It is a wonderful example of a mediocre novel that really truly came to life in film, and in the many knockoffs that it spawned, but itself fails to measure up.  I simply did not find it an engaging read that transported me to another time and universe with its own rules, which was what I had hoped for.  Now, I try to read these classics naively and on their own merits, and I must say that this is one of the more disappointing experiences I have had.

However, what I do know is that it is splendidly written in a quirky style, which I studied when younger, and the stories are full of psychological depth and personal reflection.  While I find her plays and scripts somewhat shallow with easy-to-label characters, I admit that I liked this book as a fully realized work of art.<br /><br />While I do think it matters if she consciously fictionalized her life, whatever the facts this is a good read.  I will leave it to scholars and critics to hash out the debate.<br /><br />There are many memorable scenes that live in my mind:  her floating in a storm and remembering an incident of killing a snapping turtle, with reminiscences of Hammett as her great love.  The scene wanders into a rumination of death and loss, which I thought was real literature.  Of course, there is the story of Julia, but there are many other notable scenes, like Hemingway competing with Hammett over his sppon-bending abilities.  It is also a window into the past that is vividly rendered.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.	2005-07-05

He was one of the first \\"intellectuals\\" who I dutifully followed like I did Rock Stars once their original groups broke up:  once I found something good, I sought more and was continually disappointed.  That is not a criticism of the plays as they are here, but of the man in a wider context.<br /><br />No Exit is a great masterpiece of European literature, with echoes of modernism, surrealism, and the theatre of the absurd.  I did not think it was all that deep, but it is a wodnerful theatrical experience and full of potential for later analysis.  Like the best of Brecht, the viewer is left in a state of conflict and ferment, ready to talk after the work of art is over.  Sartre's work meets this standard, and is very close to first-rate literature.<br /><br />Warmly recommended as a quintessential link in leftist, existential literature.

It is really brilliant stuff, and instructive.<br /><br />My 6-year old son just can't ge enough of the Lorax.  Beyond the fact that it is stimulating for him to read, he is wondering about the messages in it.  It makes me happy and gratified to watch his mind develop.  THere is no better source, I think.

The German is fairly easy, with plenty of dialect thrown in.<br /><br />The reader can really get a sense of the age of belief in ideologies as overarching solutions to complex historical problems. But there are also great characters in this, ranging from Max Weber railing at the need for democracy during WWI and various leftist leaders to the hilarious criminals Toller met in jail. It is extraordinarily vivid and economical in expression.<br /><br />Recommended warmly for anyone who loves history.  I do not know if it has been translated.	2005-07-01

As far as it goes, this is very interesting and brilliantly described.  However, it does not cover la guerre subversive, or guerilla wars, as we saw in Vietnam and are seeing today in Irak with the suicide bombers.  While this might be called a war of attrition, it does not really fit into the framework that Mearsheimer presented, as the country is already occupied and there is no front.  While I enjoyed the analysis of the three types above, what I was looking for was the uncovered type.  Nonethless, this is an excellent book and well worth the read.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-06-30

While he has told it like a one-year trip, in fact it is a distillation of 14 years experience.<br /><br />The book is distinguished in several respects.  First, the photography is wonderful - just it is worth the price of admission.  Second, there is the story of working there as a scientist, in particular the work underwater.  It is really fascinating and full of quirky tidbits, like mummified seals thousands of years old or the faulty insulation of some fish.  Third, there are the personal tales of what it is like for the residents, and they are harrowing not in any adventuresome sense, but in the psychological demands placed on them.  Women beware of living there with so many hungry males!<br /><br />Warmly recomended.  It is also beautifully written from a stylistic standpoint.  Truly a mini-masterpiece of the genre.	2005-06-27

It is at once a manual on military strategy, on effective management of his troops, and on the psychology of the enemy.  But it is also a history, with smatterings of anthropology, sometimes our only source on a vanished pre-Roman way of life in what became France.  Finally, and most difficult to grasp, there is a political subtext, in which Caesar is communicating with both allies and rivals in Rome, advancing his career while advising future leaders on proper conduct.  Why did he mention certain things?  What did he omit?  What political image (or self-consciously enduring myth) was he creating for himself?  There are few antique documents as fascinating and to boot it is a literary masterpiece of clear exposition and rapidly moving narrative.  Once you read it - and it must be read carefully and with references to other sources - you will have no doubt that Caesar was one of the greatest leaders of all time:  afterall, his name is the basis for Tzar as well as Kaiser!<br /><br />Then there are the details.  What stick out in my mind are individual tales of bravery as well as foolishness, rendered in detail as vivid as a novel, and the ever-present possibility of failure or even disaster from which Caesar always manages to pull victory at the decisive moment; of course, there are the many instances of brutality in a time of different standards of military conduct.  Then there is the siege of Alesia.  To protect his troops and starve out the enemy (and the charismatic Gaul, Vercingetorix), Caesar at Alesia had in a matter of days not only to build a surrounding rampart facing in, but also one facing outwards (14 miles in curcumference!), to ward off the last-stand of the bravest of the Gauls.  Finally, to break the spirit of small revolts after Alesia, Caesar cut off the hands of all the Bellevoci who took up arms in a desperate, last gambit that Caesar feared would repeat itself in innumerable city-tribes as his consulship ended.  It worked.<br /><br />And there are many characters who figure later in the great civil wars that destroyed the last remnant of the Republic: Brutus, Labienus, Mark Antony, and Cicero's brother Quintus Tullius. You get glimpses of them as men as well as military leaders who later opposed Caesar.<br /><br />As with much in Classical Civilization, the more you know the more you love it.  And the more this period of diversity looks like a metaphor, or example, for the present.  There is a good reason why the educations of scholars in the humanities (as well as in the sicneces) and diplomates began with the Classical era - read this and see how relevant it still is, in light of the War in Irak.  This is one of the most important documents from the period.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  If you are predispoosed, it will influence the way you think of contemporary events..

One thing that is really great about this book is the method:  in an afternoon, you can create a series of flavored oils and vinegars and the like, which you then combine very quickly in different ways with fresh ingredients.  If done right, in spite of its common elements, each recipe has a unique taste and the variety of fresh ingredients gives it whatever flourish you require.  That being said, this is a book specifically designed for the American pallette and is not authentically Chinese, which ranks as one of the most subtle and diverse in the world - this is not a snobby criticism as I love this Americanized style, just a statement of fact.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  You will not be disappointed. Also a great gift book.	2005-06-11

Though a history buff, he was thrust into power with little preparation and after virtually no contact with FDR, whom he served as VP for only 3 months.  That Truman then achieved greatness and made astonishingly wise and shrewd decisions is rightfully the stuff of legend.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though this volume is thick enough to stop a bullet, I was continually diappointed with it.  Rather than concentrating on the events that threatened to engulf Truman, McCullough undertakes the task of promoting him as a downhome, commonsensical kinda guy who exemplified some American ideal, i.e. that allowing someone from the heartland to take over government was a really good thing.  I found this approach sentimental, defensive, and superficial, like a Ron Howard version of a very complex man.<br /><br />I would have been much happier if the book covered Truman's momentous decisions is greater detail.  To mention a few:  the use of the atomic bomb in Japan, the defense of Europe against communism (both militarily and economically, in opposition to the isolationism that was creeping back), the beginning of \\"loyalty\\" requirements in the government (and his failure to fight Joe McCarthy), and the Korean War (a \\"limited war\\" that did not seek \\"total victory\\", setting a new precedent).  Instead of exploring these with any depth - and they dominated American politics and diplomacy for the next 50 years and even do today - McCullough briefly mentions them and then asserts that Truman pretty much did the \\"right thing\\" in his homespun wisdom and simple faith in himself and the American system.  That is not good enough.<br /><br />What we get is a sanitised version of Truman the man, as he coped with these challenges.  Unfortunately, I didn't get the feeling that I was learning much about him, except that he was perservering, modest, and naturally wise.  You get no real window into his mind and very little of the dirt, except to justify that he somehow grew beyond it (which apparently he did):  but he was a machine politician from the notoriously corrupt Pendergast Kansas City, his lack of education may have led him to make some serious misjudgments whose consequences we may never be able to judge. and he showed serious signs of cracking under the stress of it all.  In a nutshell, McCullough liked him too much and hence lost the critical distance that a serious biographer needs.  This feels almost like a work of propaganda, or a PR effort rather than a genuine work of scholarship.<br /><br />Perhaps the work of Robert Caro has set the bar too high for every biography that follows.  Or perhaps McCullough is a reflection of the American self-satisfaction - the softball approach that perpetuates nostalgia for a time that never existed - that so grates on more skeptical Europeans.  Alas, I found this biography mediocre, just not meaty enough.ith these challenges.

For four years prior to that interview, I had been steeped in the literature on the \\"competitiveness question\\" - first as a graduate student at Harvard, and then in Washington, DC, as a Senate staffer.  I can say, without hesitation, that this is one of the best books that came out of the debate on what to do about the apparent economic weakness:  it is a pure statement on \\"strategic trade policy,\\" in which political negotiation was called for in addition to economic competence.<br /><br />Now, nearly 20 years after that time, I can assess this book in a new way.  Japan is no longer the juggernaut we imagined it to be:  it is now in our eyes, a beleaguered backwater, and many of the advantages we imagined it had are now seen as liabilities, perhaps even fatal ones, i.e. government-business collusion, mutually supporting conglomerate arrangements (Keiretsu), career advancement by seniority, etc.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Prestowitz argued that Japan has an unstoppable system based on the power of protected cartels.  With an inaccessible yet dynamic internal market in which to test new products, it could export the things it developed at a huge discount to it competitors, in effect eroding or destoying their industrial capabilities; Japanese consumers did suffer in the short term, but the cost was compensated for in the growth of industrial power over the long term. As such, the liberal economic system that the US had could not - and would never - be able to compete.  The only course, Prestowitz argued, was political negotiation of trade quotas.  I still believe that there is much useful in this persepctive and some truth, as evinced in the growth today of India and China.<br /><br />However, with regard to Japan, subsequent events have proven this wrong on two counts.  First, technology evolved that offered the US distinctive advantages:  the Japanese could only copy products in relatively static markets, in particular in analogue electronic devices.  They lost the digital revolution, decisively, even though they still make great cars.  Second, as the system grew very large and rich, its actors became corrupted and began to strive to preserve wealth rather than create it in new markets.  So the Japanese economy lost much of its dynamism as priviledge was preserved for the big few at the expense of smaller, hungrier firms that might create jobs and opportunities.<br /><br />I am glad to say that I did not get the job in Prestowitz's new group, the Economic Strategy Institute.  Instead, I went to Japan to learn how it did things and in the process I became a writer and journalist.  As events show, Prestowitz's approach was quickly surpassed by new and unforeseeable developments.  I learned far more by leaving DC and going to Japan - even if what I found was disppointing, I made my living debunking myths about Japan for several years, and this book is one of the things I tried to debunk, not for its political economy arguments, but for other assumptions it made.<br /><br />That being said, Prestowitz is a smart guy and latched onto new things to talk about, and has done very well for himself.  He is a great DC careerist and typical of the place.  This book made him famous and so is an interesting study in DC careerism.<br /><br />Recommended as a bit of history.  Take the ideas with a grain of salt, until the next juggernaut emerges, that is.  Then perhaps we can dust it off and employ its ideas once again.in particular in analogue electronic devices.

Stone approaches it all as both an intellectual and reporter, doing trench work on his beat yet reflecting with the depth of a real thinker, almost a contemporary historian.  His voice is unique and his emotions always ring true.<br /><br />I pulled this volume off of my father's shelf and was immediately engrossed in the vivid writing and evocation of the period.  Stone was writing for his independent newsletter - he refused to do the lecture circuit to pay his bills, preferring to stay in DC in order to do what he saw as his job of seeking the truth - and it was required reading for anyone interested in national security policy for nearly 25 years, to the late 1960s.  It is extremely stimulating, the product of an acute mind and a writer of great talent.<br /><br />Stone is open-minded and rarely does any ideological bias show itself, in spite of his earlier leftist leanings.  It is ridiculous to accuse him of being a Soviet spy - his review of the USSR on an independent trip there was that it was \\"not a good society run by honest men.\\"  The difference is that he really went there to see for himself and left with no illusions.  Also, at times he grudingly approved of Eisenhower as a promoter of peace, and saw through the charm of JFK to the traditional conservative who was underneath.  His is a uniquely independent voice.<br /><br />But his reporting forays into the national security state are perhaps what had the greatest impact.  He would often scoop reporters on the major papers with his revelations of underground nuclear testing and similar findings.  This is really great stuff, irreplacable part of our history by one of the most important independent actors who refused to join the establishment.  We are all richer for his life work.  He was a loyal dissenter, a critical patriot, which sadly would seem impossible in the DC of today.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.patriot, which sadly would seem impossible in the DC of today.  <br /> <br />Warmly recommended.	2005-05-30

If only for that, it is worth the read of anyone who is interested in understanding business or the fast-food industry.  For all his earthy common sense and lack of formal education, the system that Kroc set up can only be described as a work of genius.  Afterall, MCdonald's at the moment has surpassed Coca Cola as the most recognized brand in the world:  it serves nearly 45 million people every day, commands unparalelled influence in every related industry, and often serves as the symbol of the US itself.<br /><br />THe great strength of this book is that you get Kroc's view of what makes himself tick:  he devoted himself relentlessly to a single business purpose within the capitalist system, was open to suggestions from talent that he cultivated regarding that purpose, and adapted it as he needed to thrive.  It is a remarkable story of a man who re-made himself many times, and began what became the McDonald's corporation in his 50s!  You simply have to respect what he accomplished at a time when most men would have given up.<br /><br />The pillars of his business model are well known:  1) it is more an ecosystem of separate companies that grow together with long-term bonds of trust and the highest standards of professional conduct; 2) it pursues operational efficiency while refusing to compromise safety and cleanliness; 3) it is adept at finding innovations pioneered by both its suppliers and owner-operators and then disseminating them into the system; 4) it sticks to its core competency - hamburger and fries - and with few exceptions listens to consumers.  That is about it, really, in an idealist version, but it explains why the company's many competitors failed to grow as big and fast.<br /><br />During the process, furthermore, Kroc did not go for making a quick buck - by selling franchise rights for a killing or gouging his owner-operators by monopolising what supplies they had to buy from him - and focused instead on treating his suppliers and owner-operators fairly, reasoning that if they could thrive, so would he.  No other fast-food chain did that.<br /><br />Of course, as an autobio, Kroc focuses far more on the bright side of what he has done.  He does not ask himself any hard questions and comes off, not surprisingly, as distrusting of the motives of his critics as well as the legitimate concerns of many intellectuals and political activists.  While open-minded, we see, he was myopically focused on refining his business model and hence unaware of his impact on the wider society.<br /><br />Moreover, except for some quotes and quirky details, the business issues are also covered better in McDonald's Behind the Arches, by John F. Love.  But then, both are authorised versions of the McDonald's view.  The reader will need to look elsewhere for more thoughtful critiques.<br /><br />Recommended.

Thus, there is an element of luck involved, in that he was stationed in Japan after the war, but it can't hide the fact that this is the product of a mediocre mind.  Christopher asks none of the hard questions and never probes below the surface of Japan - the superficial facade they present to foreigners, or \\"tatemae\\" - and so it fails miserably.  Instead, the reader is served up the most traditional exoticisms that have long been de-bunked, ridiculously romanticised notions that anyone who has lived in Japan comes to see as patently untrue.  But then, Christopher never seems to have questioned any of it.<br /><br />I have read a lot of books on Japan, and this one is one of the worst by far.

The ideas of these men - and a few women - are evoked briefly as are vivid portriats of their personalites.  There is, for example, Robert Oppenheimer and the ups and downs of his tumultuous career.<br /><br />While this is fun to read, it is very broad and general.  If you want more on anyone or any subject from a scholarly point of view, you will need to go to a more detailed source.  That doesn't change the fact that this is a great overview and can serve as the beginning of a lifetime of study on these creative and influential people.

According to Stiglitz, they blindly apply their economic ideology with virtually no regard to nurturing the institutions that would be vital to overseeing and managing the free markets that they wish to promote.  While I cannot say from experience in DC whether he is correct, if he is it is a truly shocking indictment of the way that free-market policies are imposed on the developing world - their way of doing it all, Stiglitz claims, is unbelievably crude and naive, often in their ignorence they do far more damage to complex societies than helping them to make a difficult transition.<br /><br />Put simply, Stiglitz argues that the IMF purebreed economists need to think more like the political economists at the World Bank, where - surprise! - he fought the IMF for many years.  Rather than blindly pursue their mathematically rigorous visions, he argues, they should nurture a wider array of institutions with greater patience ove rlonger periods of time than the shock treaments popular today.  I admit that I do tend to side with Stiglitz's ideas and it what he says is true, it is truly pathetic.<br /><br />Unfortunatly, Stiglitz writes in a monotonous style that repeats many of his arguments verbatim in successive chapters.  In spite of that, his perspective is so important that it deserves careful scrutiny for anyone interested in the economies of the developing countries.<br /><br />Recommended strongly.	2005-05-23

I feared that he would take an obvious side, and hammer it into the ground.<br /><br />What I found instead was an absolutely and scrupulously fair interpretation of what happened in the McCarthy era and why so many good and talented people betrayed their erstwhile friends.  Navasky approaches it as the worst kind of personal moral dilemma:  how can you save your career and not betray your deepest personal (and sometimes still political) allegiances.<br /><br />The cast of characters comes predominently from the truly first rate, for example Jerome Robbins or Elia Kazan.  Navassky shows how the struggled with their decision to name names, often convincing themselves that they had to do it to be an ethical person and good american, and then - to his great credit - he explores the shattering psychological repercussions that ensued.  These actors in the drama are very human and caught in a dilemma so terrible that I pray I never will face a similar choice.  Rather than seek a few weak bad guys, it is an indictment of an entire political system and policial era.  Even if you are not convinced by his argument, the reader feels compelled to reflect on it.  I certainly did.<br /><br />Warmly recommended as a profound inquiry into moral choice, placed vividly in historical context.  This is a masterpiece.	2005-05-06

This book is an absolutely magnificent tableau of American politics in all its complexity and ambiguity.  Lukas investigated the lives of three families in a fundamental controversy on the future of America:  forced school busing.<br /><br />The first family are brahmans, from Harvard Law and straight into the Mayor's office in a moment of idealism that would forever change his career.  He is a mechanic of political change, who is trying to lead a good and honorable life.  Then there is a working class Irish family, from the other side of the tracks.  The widowed mother becomes a great adversary of the process underway, in no way racist but opposed for very practical and personal reasons to forced busing.  Finally, there is a black family, struggling to get by amidst dashed hopes and pathological mental illness, the supposed benificiariers of a great social experiment.  The portrayals of these lives - all real and thoroughly investigated by an absolutely first-rate investigative journalist - are beyond novellistic realism.  The personalities are so vivid and well drawn that it is simply astonishing.<br /><br />Then there is the wider political/historical milieu, Boston in the early 1970s.  Lukas stops at nothing to create a composite picture:  there is the mayor Kevin White (whom I was astonished to learn was considered by Jimmy Carter as a running mate in 1976), Ted Kennedy, and scores of others including the archdiscese and various minor politician-demagogues hoping to make a career out of the crisis.  The portrait is as beautiful and detailed as the Sistine Chapel, exposing the best, the worst, and the unexpected in American politics of the period.  Lukacs' talent to do all of this is simply extraordinary.  Late in the writing, I learned, he had to throw out one of the three families and begin the entire process over again in the name of thoroughness.  No wonder he won a pulitzer.<br /><br />This book also spoke to me personally.  I was in Boston for part of the time, in the very neighborhood where the brahmans lived as a personal social experiment, and I witnessed many of the events as they unfolded.  Lukacs' evocation of it all struck me as entirely accurate, pitch perfect to where people were coming from and what they hoped and feared.  As such, this book is a crucible of the American race conundrum, a turning point of the greatest political import, perhaps equal to the Vietnam war protests.<br /><br />And the writing!  It is elegant and clear beyond imagination, approaching what I would call genius, the product of an unusually driven mind.  The characters are so vivid that I will refelct on them until the day I die.  This is destined to become a classic, like Tacitus or Thucydides - the quality is truly that high.  I have read HUNDREDS of political-historical books, and this one ranks as near the top as a handful.<br /><br />Recommended as a true must-read.  Get it, make the effort, for an excpetional reading experience.t of the time, in the very neighborhood where the brahmans lived as a personal social experiment, and I witnessed many of the events as they unfolded.

I was thoroughly engrossed by the book and greatly enjoyed the pictures.<br /><br />It was, of course, written in celebration of the company at the 50th anniversary of the first Kroc McDo in Des Plaines, Illinois.  From that point, as we know, the company grew into one of the most potent cultural forces in the world, which this book chronicles.  THere are no startling revelations, of course, and hence the book is not at all critical.  The reader will have to go elsewhere for that, and much of its substance can be found in \\"Behind the Golden Arches\\" already.<br /><br />But what you get is a detailed explanation in vivid portraits of the usual McDo structure:  the corporate offices, the owner/operators, and the suppliers.  Each is like a leg on a stool, and operate largely as autonomous companies in a shared ecosystem.  That is a key to the McDo success story, as they have incentives to work together, but must be painstakingly convinced to do so:  the corporation cannot order them around.  That makes change difficult, but when it occurs, very deep and longlasting.  Then there is the history of the US, even when there are painful memories such as the Vietnam War, and how it inter-related with McDOnald's growth.<br /><br />THere are many odd facts here, such as WIllard Scott, who was the first Ronald McDOnald on DC TV.  But there are also the many experiemnts that led to the current menu and cultural \\"message\\" of the company.<br /><br />This is a feelgood volume, to be sure.  But it is fascinating, well written, and beautifully illustrated.  With all the criticism of this massive company, this is fun.<br /><br />Recommended.  But if you want to delve very deeply, you must look elsewhere.	2005-05-04

It is very fun and as far as I can tell, a very accurate reconstruction of the time.  What is most interesting is Vidal's take on it, that is, that Christianity would turn out to be the worst thing that ever happened to Western Civilisation and this was the last opportunity to snuff it - rather than as the inevitable positive outcome.  That took guts to write, in particular in the 1960s when it was published.  His take is simply wonderfully jaundiced.<br /><br />This is also a good place to learn about Rome and what was going on at the twilight of the Western Empire, with its power struggles, multiple religions, and decadence.

Alas, while it tries to address this agenda, there is very little of substance here beyond some rather simplistic assertions of how and why this was done.  Sure, math has creeped into most academic disciplines, from hard to social sciences, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be questioned, which the authors fail to do.  As such, what you get is a series of exmaples, none of which I can even remember, some assertions of philosophical relevance, and then not much more than simple convenstional views.<br /><br />For example, even the title attests to the authors' superficial treatment:  Descartes is portrayed as the source of much of the revolution of the physical and other sciences, folllowing his \\"vision\\" of unifying the sciences while lieing in an oven to keep warm.  Well, I think even that view can be challenged:  many scientists I know, while acknowledging his contribution to math with coordinate geometry, would argue that Descartes philosophical writings in fact had little impact on the direction of science - one even told me that it was the French intelligensia that hoped to claim responsibility for the sci revolution then underway.  (In this view, the real hero would be Newton.)  THe authors' probe none of that.  Nor do they question the usefulness of what I see as an overapplication of math to many disciplines, such as political science and even economics in some cases, which may be revealed as little more than academic fashions in the future.<br /><br />That makes this book the conventional view, over lightly.  Not recommended.  Mathematicians may like it, but critics of math will not.	2005-04-22

Finally, I was in a place where I could, so I turned to the various preparations that I could find.<br /><br />This short book was indisputably one of the best, and it doesn't shy from bold pronouncements and interpretations.  Lee is a classical scholar of great learning and brings together a huge range of sources in this 100plus-page book.<br /><br />First, he gives a synopsis.  Then, he interprets it, with full awareness that the reader may disgree.  While the content is covered by other reviewers here, I wanted to say that this added immensely to my experience of this uniquely complex work of near-modern art.  Plus, it is aimed that at erudite admirers, but to those (like me) desperate for an anchor as I approach the unique intensity of Wagner.<br /><br />While it relies a bit too heavily on depth psychology, which places this interpretation at a certain time, it is never dogmatic and addresses many of the other philosophical ideas that underlie it.  This is my only caveat.  Truly great works of art are re-interpreted by every age, and this one will be too.  In addition, it cannot be the only source one approaches - you need to listen to the music as well, so this is one supplement.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.	2005-04-21

What happened is an intersection of arrogance, greed, and stupidity that is unprecedented in my research and reading experience on business.  That is easy to get.  What is hard to comprehend is how it went on for so long - with so many willing accomplices in outside firms, from Andersen to Merrill Lynch - and the precise financial and accounting techniques that were employed.  As such, I think this story is an indictment of the entire establishment of people who think and write about business, myself included.  Let's admit that we didn't see this one coming and didn't ask the right questions!<br /><br />As a first-rate reporter, Eichenwald takes us through the entire story, offering up personal details that allow the reader to imagine that they enter the heads of the people involved.  It is a tour de force, with ample documentation to back up every reconstructed conversation, and beautifully written.<br /><br />The story that emerges is that once Ken Lay left the confines of a stodgy business - natural gas pipelines - he got way way out of his depth.  His company evolved into a trading conglomerate, and not even its competitors clearly understood how it was making money.  At first, it did well, growing to become one of Wall Street's darlings and even a major political player.<br /><br />But underneath, lots of things were going wrong.  FOr starters, much of its profits came from an accounting redefinition (mark-to-market), in which the company was allowed to book profits for deals immediately - based on the company's own estimates (!) - and regardless of cash flow in subsequent years.  That made dealmaking the road to profitability, creating what can only be described as an elaborate ponzi scheme:  to show a profit, the company had to strike more and more deals, even as its cash position was precarious.<br /><br />Then things got worse.  Many of the deals that Enron made were simply bad and not checked out in any serious way (with proper \\"due diligence\\").  In other words, decisions involving hundreds of millions and then billions were made off the cuff in areas that the executives were almost entirely ingorant, like electricity plants in India, water futures, and of course, the broadband internet.  This resulted in a huge array on non-performing assets.  In spite of this, the way to advance in the company remained to make deals regardless of their quality.<br /><br />SOmewhere along the line - possibly when Rich Kinder, one of the original top execs, left - management lost control of the situation.  This is where Andy Fastow - the great villain of the book who was also catastrophically stupid, to put it mildly - was appointed CFO, turning an oversight office into a profit center!  No one thought to question him as he created accounting schemes that allowed the company to report huge profits by shunting non-performing assets into secretive \\"partnerships\\", all while enriching himself and several conspirators.<br /><br />To keep banks and accountants on board, Fastow played hardball, threatening to cut them out of hugely profitable deals if they refused to play along, and most of them did play along while complaining that it was sleazy and then doing nothing to stop him. (FOr this complicity, many of them paid later in prison sentences as well as the demise of Arthur Andersen.)  Fastow also got dissenting analysts and even Andersen acountants off the Enron account if they dared question the company's postion, ruining their careers.  It is only the beginning of the human suffering that resulted from the company's eventual collapse.<br /><br />Skilling and Lay, according to Eichenwald, kept themselves blissfully unaware of this situation as they went about their roles as corporate celebrities at the highest level.  This is a failing so blatant that it is beyond catastrophe.  They are the fools of the title, if you can believe that they weren't in on the whole thing.  Indeed, the company had no business strategy or business model!  In retrospect, there appear, according to the author, to have been many in the organization who worried about its practices, but their advice was eith systematically ignored or dismissed by those who were compromised.  But in my view, even the most self-serving fool should have recognized the blatant conflicts of interest - Fastow was CFO as well as the manager of off-account funds, which meant that Enron often did business with itself, as customer and purchaser, with all transactions booked as profits for hefty fees for Fastow and his helpers!<br /><br />As told, the story is truly rivetting and a fascinating look into the roaring 1990s.  However, Eichenwald refrains from both adding analytical context and offering his opinions on the protagonists.  That means that this book strives for pure reporting rather than the eloquent moral commentaries of a David Halberstam.  I think that that lessens the import of the book significantly, though others may prefer it that way.  Moreover, occasional value judgments did slip in, in such comments as Eichenald's assertions that \\"even a baboon could have made money on the deal.\\"  After all the work he did, he cannot but have reached his own conclusions, which by force influenced his writing - so why not be open about them?<br /><br />In spite of these criticisms, this is wonderful reporting and lively writing.  Warmly recommended.d no business strategy or business model!

It follows his career from his origins as an undistinguished Army officer to the most presigious cabinet post (the Sec. of State) with dreams of the Presidency.<br /><br />What so outrages Morris, who is essentially a conservative, is the way Haig got there.  The most important step in his career was his assignment to the WHite House.  What he did there was make sure that he was present whenever Nixon would wander into the situation room, usually at 2 am or some crazy hour, always to find Haig.  THey would chat, and eventually, with a lot of brown-nosing, Haig finagled a political appointment and slowly worked his way up - not by any competence or expertise, but by sheer flattery and the willingness to wait all hours just for a shot at Nixon's ear.<br /><br />Morris then attempts to demonstrate, I think effectively though opinions may differ, that Haig rose in spite of a mediocre mind and blatant over-reaching ambition.  We witness Haig and all his political missteps until he gets fired from the Reagan Administration.  Indeed, Morris states that he wrote the entire book as an indictment of a political system that could allow such a man to advance the way he did.  While I agree that Haig is as shallow as he appears in this book, I must say that I have sympathy for someone with such naked drive - you gotta make it somehow, and that was how Haig did.  There are a lot of others like him in DC:  they are called sycophants.<br /><br />This is pretty strong stuff.  Unfortunately, Haig and his views are not quite  interesting enough to merit an entire book, at least in my view.  So a lot of it is pretty boring,like Haig himself - this is real insider DC bureaucratic stuff.  It is of very limitied interest to poli-sci students or those curious about politics.<br /><br />Recommended for serious polical junkies with these limits in mind.	2005-04-11

While I am not someone who is that into philosophy, Kaufmann writes with the most astonishing clarity and lucidity, explaining where they advanced certain notions related to the unconscious as well as how much they really accomplished in the advancement of knowledge.  I admit, I will never read most of this stuff in the original text, so I needed someone who would explain it all as Kaufmann did.<br /><br />Nietzsche comes off the best, as a kind of prototypical explorer of the mind and its unconscious imagery.  He is perhaps the only one of these writers whom I would want to study in depth.<br /><br />Heidegger, on the other hand, is subjected to withering criticism.  In my reading, the basis of his analysis is that Heidegger is in fact a rather minor philosopher, who was elevated by the need of post-War Germans to have a great one.  In other words, his cult is pure fashion and nationalism.  Kaufmann in my view does a great job of demolishing the academic pretensions surrounding Heidegger - what undergraduate hasn't seen a number of his peers carrying around some fat book by Heidegger, implying that beyond other mortals he is up to reading it all and \\"getting it\\"?  Kaufmann also highlights how truly awful most writing is in philosophy, which is what puts me off of it.  Nonetheless, I must admit that I cannot evaluate what Heidegger accomplished and frankly will never take the time to do so.<br /><br />The bottom line is, Kaufmann shows great courage, even audacity, in his critiques of contemporary philosophers.  Recommended warmly as a fascinating read.	2005-03-28

That's this Nixon	In spite of the positive views of this book expressed here, I admit that I found it weak and diasppointing.  Not only is Crowley fauning and seemingly incapable of asking any of the difficult questions, but the way that Nixon prattles on diminished him in my view far more than it rehabilitated him.<br /><br />I have always thought that Nixon and LBJ were the last truly interesting presidents we had - each presided over watershed moments in American political history, each aspired to accomplish some great things.  While some posturing was inevitable, their presidencies were far more about issues than the PR puffery we get today.<br /><br />The fall of Nixon is one of the most momentous occurences in US history.  How, I always wondered, could such an exceptional, talented, and intelligent man make such catastrophically bad decisions?  What in the end did he learn from the debacle and what lessons does he have to offer us?  What are his real views on the course of US history?  On contemporary politics?  Has he come to view it all in a non-partisan manner?<br /><br />Rather than take any of these things on - Crowleys pretentions notwithstanding that she is recording his \\"talking to history\\" through her - we are served up dish after dish of self-serving arguments by Nixon. Even worse, in my reading, what he is most concerned about is getting treated with the proper dignity and respect (by current politicians) due to a former president, the achievement of which he devotes most of his fading energies. Not only is that boring, but it is pathetic how baldly he goes about worrying and complaining about how he is treated in trivial ceremonial events.  Or he gloats about Clinton's problems.  Rather than an elder statesman with something to say, he comes off as a wounded narcissist with an appallingly narrow vision.<br /><br />I am not and never was a Nixon hater.  Indeed, with a few glaring exceptions, I admired his diplomacy and the many things his administration did to implement the commitments of the Great Society in practical ways.  He was a great politician and an American original.  What I got here undermind that perception, I am sorry to say.<br /><br />Crowley in my view is a sycophant, pure and simple.  Nixon saw this in her and used her, allowing his most self-serving arguments to gain full flower in the hands of a 20-something recent college grad.  She fails to challenge him on anything and is wholly uncriticial, perhaps lacking the depth to do so.  There is not a dash of irony or self-awareness in any of it.  Both she and Nixon should be ashamed at this.<br /><br />This is a lousy book, just a whitewash.  Nixon comes off very badly, if you read the subtext, in his last opportunity to come clean about his many mistakes and offer perspective on a remarkable life.  He barely even admits any regrets, except as it relates to how he will be remembered, that is, he failed to reflect deeply on himself and learned nothing.<br /><br />Not recommended.Society in practical ways.

The story involves a very interesting history of the science as well as the reactions of the beef and fast food industries.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the disease appears to be caused by an improperly folded protein (a \\"prion\\"), which when it enters the bloodstream can multiply and eventually turn the host's brain into mush, with horrible consequences of course.  What the authors highlight is that the mode of transmission appears to be ingestion of these bent proteins, principally from infected cows, years if not decades before symptoms appear.  They also stress that the manner in which cows are raised in industrial agriculture makes transmission far more likely:  they are directly fed ruminants (leftover cow remains that cannot be eaten by humans), thereby transferring the prions on a massive scale.  Humans can then eat them and perhaps become infected by BSE.<br /><br />After this fascinating and beautifully writtern history, the authors then explore what should be done.  While some ruminant feeding has ceased, they argue, the actions of beef producers are both too little (because they are voluntary) and inadequate (because they allow certain forms of ruminant, such as blood, to be fed to cows today).  This part of the book is pure advocacy and, I believe, effective in arguing that all ruminant feeding must cease.  While I cannot weigh in on the science, it really got me to think in a more informed way.<br /><br />Recommended.  This could become a far greater debate if, it turns out, a lot more infected beef-eating Americans are found.  The authors stimulate debate.	2005-03-09

Written by a professor in an obscure vocabulary that reeks of self-appointed elitism, it develops a convoluted argument against McDonald's as a cultural force that is subverting the polticial process in America and even the world. He claims that a burger is not just a burger, but instead eating one is a political act and even a religious ritual without offering anything in support of such claims except his weird academic discipline.<br /><br />While I find much of value in such radical critiques as No Logo or Fast Food Nation, which in spite of their excesses explore very worthy questions, this book is simply off the deep end.  Even worse, though the author claims he has done field research in conversations with people queueing at McDonald's, the book is really pure academic indulgence in the form of an incestuous group that reads and supports eachothers' writing - and perpetuates a common vacabulary.<br /><br />These views are so outrageously silly and incoherent that it is hard to believe someone can make a living by writing - and teaching - about it.  For example, he argues that in enticing kids into the McDo world, the company is decisively damaging the child-parent relationship because kids will nag their parents to get burgers.  Well, my kids do, but we set limits on them anyway - once a week or less - and they forget about it immediately.  What is the big deal about that?<br /><br />Moreover, the author is baffled that the people he interviews in line get angry when he implies they don't get the dangerous \\"politics\\" behind the act of getting a burger, ie support of a global capitalist system, etc etc.  Gosh, maybe they are just in a hurry and don't want to listen to the weird trip that some high-fallutin intellectual tries to impose in them.  Why, I wonder, can't a person just like the burgers without becoming a sop to \\"hegemonistic\\" big capital?  Afterall, the ultimate consumer control is just deciding not to buy them - and lots of us do so.  Whether he likes it or not, that option exists.<br /><br />I wish I could say that I learned something useful from this book, but I didn't.  Instead, I waded through such phrases as:  \\"When consumers are in hermeneutic freefall, they are set up for advertisers poised to insert corporate consumption values into the vacuum left by the dissolution of previous beliefs.\\"  If this guy is trying to connect to the public, he's got a LONG way to go.<br /><br />If I could put his argument in a nutshell, it is that McDonald's is both a (\\"modernist\\") corporation that seeks operational efficiency with ruthless rationality and a (\\"post-modernist\\") manufacturer of culture that speaks to our unconscious needs.  In a confusing age (\\"hyperreality\\"), he argues, the company strives to be a place of stability and value for customers that fills an existential gap in their lives.  By extension, he claims, just going there co-opts us all into its \\"hegeomonistic ideology\\" of global capitalism and hence is inherently political.  This is strong stuff with a ton of questionable assumptions built in.<br /><br />The author never, so far as I can tell, approached anyone inside of McDonald's - the supposed evil cabal that is seeking to dominate the world through the insidious exploitation of our children - preferring instead to create the most ridiculous of caricatures.  For example, he claims that McDo's early managers were supposed to be uniform anti-intellectual automatons, that Ronald McDonald is actually a reflection of Ray Kroc's right-wing ideology, etc.  This type of analysis is not only inaccurate - Kroc preferred diversity of opinion and cultivated it - but it is about as sophisticated as a maoist comic book.<br /><br />The factual inaccuracies are also legion, such as the author's claim that Kroc hired only men as managers - one of his key executives from the beginning was a woman - or even the date that Kroc gained complete control.  While these are details, they signal a sloppiness with how he deals with the company that should make the careful reader suspicious.<br /><br />At the heart of all of this, in my view, Kincheloe confuses riding the wave of economic forces with the underlieing causes of socio-economic transformation.  McDo rode the wave of suburbanization and the development of industrial-style fast food - it didn't invent the wave, yet it exploited it better than did the other fast food chains.  It does have an impact on our culture, to be sure, but I don't think its influence is much larger than deciding to buy a burger once a week or once a day.  Furthermore, there is an unproven assumption that once set in childhood, eating patterns will never change.  Again, this pathetically exagerates the impact of the company:  I used to eat a burger a day, and now I don't.  I bet there are a lot of people like me - our tastes evolve. Duh.<br /><br />However, what the author totally misses, in my opinion, is that McDo is in fact a relatively responsive corporation that is learning to listen to its critics.  It is beginning to work with some NGOs and corporate watchdogs, and will evolve.  Sure, a lot of it may be enlightened self interest, but would it be better if the company ignored its critics?  I think that how McDo responds to situations is more than just cynical ploys to fend off lawsuits, though I suspect that that opinion is too nuanced for those who want simple enemies.  THere are people who care in the company - it is not a monolith of greedy exploiters of children as Kincheloe would have us belive, but a living institution that can strive to change for the better.  Why should we not take the company at its word, that is, look at what it says it is trying to do and then make it live up to those ideals?  While many would regard this as naively optimistic, the only thing I have to say is that as a reporter I have observed that such corporations do exist and I believe that McDonald's is striving to be one of them.  That doesn't mean these companies always do the right thing and that things shouldn't be better, but there are smart people in them who want to and are working within the system to change them - they can be allies to corporate critics, if we choose to work with them rather than automatically against them.<br /><br />So, I would not recommend this book.  Look elsewhere for useful critiques of capitalism and burger empires.  THere are many books far more worthy of thoughtful examination.hile these are details, they signal a sloppiness with how he deals with the company that should make the careful reader suspicious.

This is one of the few descriptive histories that does, in my reading experience.  I was utterly spellbound by the story - of a driven and talented black man who killed to defend himself and became a national figure during his trial - and enveloped in a narrative of both literary beauty and moral power.  It is superlatively written, erudite, and thoroughly American.<br /><br />The story begins with a young doctor, who buys a house in a working class district of Detroit.  With the combination of fear that real estate values will fall and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in reaction to the new cosmopolitanism emerging in the Jazz Age, his neighbors gather into a mob to eject him - violently.  But he is ready to defend himself with great courage and pride, and does so when the police fail to act.  An apparently innocent man is killed, the doctor is arrested, and a complicated legal and political process begins.<br /><br />The tableau that the author paints is richly textured with historical background and a cast of remarkable characters.  He begins with a history of the failure of Reconstruction through the industrial revolution of mass manufacturing in the post World War I era.  It is rivetting and evoked with great depth and literary elegance.<br /><br />The personalities involved are unusual and first rate.  There is Ossian, the doctor, whose psychology is intricately portrayed.  Having witnessed a racial lynching in Florida as a boy, from a peasant family, he reaches the highest level possible for his station in 1920s American society - a professional doctor in Dubois' \\"talented tenth\\" who studied in Europe - and was determined to impress his young wife (and his peers) with his self-serving resolve.  So against the advice of many and with the shallow promises of help from his colleague-peers, he bought a house in the white district and stuck to his guns.<br /><br />Once the \\"self defense\\" incident took place, the NAACP got involved.  There is James Weldon Johnson and his remarkable publicist, White, who saw the case as a way to test the American court systen to advance their race; it was a spectacular predessessor to what culminated in the 1950s.  Both of them are unique for their talents - Johnson was a songwriter of Broadway hits and White wrote a bestselling novel in two weeks between journlist jobs - and devoted to advancing their race in a typically audacious American way in the courts.<br /><br />Then there are Ossian's lawyers, first of all Clarence Darrow, but also many others, who challenged the legal apparatus as they enhanced their celebrity.  I knew very little about Darrow and the others, and each mini-biography was revelation - and indeed an inspiration - to me.  The case was of great legal significance, and the narrative loses nothing of its flow in the recounting of it.  Finally, there is a good followup to what happened to all the characters, including the enigmatic Ossian, which adds additional perspective.<br /><br />In sum, this is an absolutely first-rate book, a masterpiece of history investigation and, even better, plain good storytelling.  I will never forget its depth and I hope the author continues.<br /><br />Highest reccomendation.ook place, the NAACP got involved.

It begins with the ancient Greeks and their Ventian counterparts during the Renaissance(!), and progresses to the present-day crisis in the accounting profession.  Brewster writes about it all as clearly as a professional writer-reporter would, which is enjoyable considering how many dry and self-serving academic books there are on the subject today.  While he does not add anything all that original about the present time, his book does convincingly demonstrate that AA was not any worse than the other firms, though with a series of missteps and its involvement with Enron it made itself, in Brewster's words, \\"an ideal target\\" of the government.  But all the big acct firms desired to make money from their insider knowledge:  they lost their ideal of public service, i.e. guarantors of the underpinings of the capitalist system.  This bears out my own research and as such is an extremely useful book for anyone attempting to put this arcane and vital-for-capitalism discipline - accounting - in context.<br /><br />Recommended as an ideal introduction to those who are interested.  Admittedly, that is a rather important caveat.	2004-12-19

Bloch sets out to change the impression of chemistry as a dull discipline - with great success.<br /><br />The story of biochemistry, as he tells it, is full of riddles and surprises.  It began in 1897, when Eduard Buchner ground up yeast cell with sand, plugged them into a bottle, and woke up to find the cork had popped out during the night.  Seemingly so banal, this discovery overturned the \\"vitalist\\" notion of the processes of life, that they could operate solely in intact, living cells.  It proved, instead, that cell physiology could be studied as purely chemical reactions.  The next 50 years, which Bloch describes as the Golden Age of biochem, witnessed the discovery of enzymes and other molecules behine innumerable chemical processes.  And the methods that scientists used were similar to those of Buchner:  grind up cells to free their chemical constituents, and then attempt to predict their behavior under a variety of conditions.<br /><br />Among the many notable repercussions of these experiments was the development of the science of nutrition - by isolating, purifying, and uncovering the molecular structure of amino acids, fatty acids, and vitamins.  Once identified, researchers could experiment to find what combination led to better health.<br /><br />But Bloch doesn't stop with these, and many similar, observations.  In a series of delightful extrapolations, he explains why domestic cats need to hunt (they can't synthesize the amino acid taurine, so must find it in the meat of animals who can); how dark latin venetians used soap to bleach their hair blond (a hydrogen peroxide reaction that sunlight enabled); or the reasons that Amerindians ground corn meal on limestone (they needed a certain chemical added to corn to avoid developing bari bari).<br /><br />Bloch also offers glimpses into the unknown, areas that are not yet explained but hold promising applications.  The list is so long that the book must be read:  they include the potential uses of thalidomide, insect secretions that might protect us, and the like.  It is truly dazzling.  What you get is a personal portrait of a vital field that the author, a Harvard Nobel Laureate, helped to create.  The writing is also clear and vivid, never dry.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.into the unknown, areas that are not yet explained but hold promising applications.

While there is occasionally a sense of victimization running through it - the authors all worked for AA or were affiliated with it - it does not stop them from hard-hitting analysis of how a company declined from iconic status as a standard-setter to one that was, well, slowly corrupted and traducing its values (like, the authors contend, all the other big accounting firms).<br /><br />What this book adds is an analysis of how AA's governance evolved, from a tightly controlled firm with a charismatic leader to a global, highly decentralised one that was impossible to govern.  This was a slow, evolutionary development with consequences that no one could have foreseen.  Slowly, values eroded, a culture came undone, and the result was, in many cases, a naked scramble for money.  In essence, accounting became a doorway to far more lucrative consulting arrangements, and so AA began increasingly to cooperate with those it was supposed to audit as a public service and with independence and integrity (as it clearly did in the past when the firm stood for something).<br /><br />Where this book is weaker is on the wider context of the economy, which the reader will have to seek elsewhere.  Moreover, while the SEC scrutiny - and the indictment that killed the company - may have been unfair, there were so many scandals developing that at least one firm was slated to take a fall.  It was AA, as it turned out, somewhat a scapegoat in which many many good people got hurt, but still, in retrospect, it looks very very bad.  I cannot feel outrage at its demise, though I do feel sympathy.<br /><br />Recommended for specialists.  This ain't pleasure reading, but the story is one that needs to be told as an ethics case study.	2004-12-01

Ka, the poet protagonist, goes to the town as a journalist, but like all poets his motives are deeply personal and particular:  he is seeking love.  What he enters is a political inbroglio so complex that it is far beyond anything he could imagine, let alone fathom.  Through it all, after a four-year draught as a political exile in Germany, his muse returns and he begins to write.  The result is a novel that does what the best of Naipal does: illuminate a place and time with vivid and unforgettable images.  This novel will shape my perceptions of Turkey for the rest of my life.<br /><br />The cast of character is truly dazzling.  In addition to Ka, there is a kind doppelganger genius, Blue, who is a religious fanatic accused of murder and a great seducer of women and youth.  These two enter the most subtle of conflicts, mixing personal motive and political purpose.  Then there are struggling youths, who wonder what it is all about while seeking some firm ground for their ambitions and talents, which are wasted in the backwater town on the border with Russia and in decline from the times when it was a bustling crossroad.  Finally, there is the family that Ka attempts to enter, which is broken from divorce and failed hopes.  These characters are so real that it is simply painful to behold.  And there is so much about the plight of modern Turkey, with its warring ethnic groups, identity confusions (is it European or Muslim?), and the all-powerful \\"repulbican\\" Kemalist state, which does not hesitate to use violent force in its secular mission to meld nationalism and democratic values.  The depth here is truly Tolstoyan.<br /><br />Then, there is the plot.  While I do not want to reveal anything here, it involves unexpected violence and repression as a reaction to young women who want to (illegally) wear head scarves to state schools and a large number of whom are committing suicide for mysterious reasons.  Ka walks into all this, declaring his love and grasping, in perhaps his last opportunity, for personal happiness - his political ideals are long given up and even ironic now.  His fate is out of his control.<br /><br />Pamuk is brilliant in his use of themes, which he weaves into a labyrinth that will occupy the time of many a PhD student seeking to unravel them.  It is extraordinarliry rich, involving artistic longing, poltical power, egotistic narcissism, and the search for love. There are plays within plays, with a dramatist who wants to influence the political fate of the nation, and Ka's adoptive family, who in themselves are leaders and social harbingers.

However, the book is less about the moral or political debate than about the impact of the \\"new media\\".  Fortunately, given his credentials as a contributing editor at WIRED, it is not another hack essay full of silly utopian predictions.  Instead, it is a thoughtful, provocative, and deliciously sarcastic take on the information revolution and its self-proclaimed critics.<br /><br />Katz argues that the traditional media, from the NYT to CBS News, are under assault from a wide variety of new into technologies and new formats such as talk radio or Larry King Live.  And, he believes, it is presumably Gen X that is taking the lead.  The new media are not only democratic but highly interactive, offering anyone with an opinion an opportunity to communicate with millions instantly.  There are the principal reasons, Katz believes, that the old-style media are slowly losing ground: their audience will no longer accept elite judgments about what is news and what is not.<br /><br />This frightens a lot of people, the \\"mediaphobes\\".  Parents fret that the internet exposes their children to pornography and offers of sex from predatory strangers, satanic cults etc.  Katz argues that the attempt to shut down these media is an admission of fear, ignorence and simple laziness.  This allows opportunistic demagogues, like the gambling-addicted William Bennett, to blame the media.<br /><br />It is a great delight to read how Katz demolishes the demagogues calls for techno-restrictions and censorship as attempts to avoid the real issues, which are complex social choices in the end.<br /><br />Katz' remedies are sober and simple:  parents should lighten up and get involved in the new culture and media with their kids.  This means rational discussions, negotiation, judicious limit-setting, and basic trust in our children.  In this high-tech age, the old-fashioned wisdom of these suggestions is refreshing.<br /><br />But Katz book offers more than that.  Unlike the bland, old-style media he criticizes, his book is passionate rather than dryly \\"objective\\" (presenting both sides of view as if each were equally legitimiate, which is such a bore today).  Nonetheless, he never goes overboard - he is outraged yet does not need to create political strawmen to trash and blame.<br /><br />Also, there is a book within a book, looking at Thomas Paine as a new-media man of his age.  This was a fascinating analysis that made me want to learn much more about him.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.

It was also a country in transition into a world industrial power, and the focus of the story is the Columbian Exposition, or Chicago World's Fair.  A subplot, the horrible underside that accompanies the work of genius and audacity, is the story of America's first identified serial Killer.  The reader really feels like s/he is a witness.<br /><br />One the one hand, you have Daniel Burnham, an architect and organizer of genius, who is collaborating with Olmstead in the design and building of the Exposition.  They want to top the French and the Eifel Tower, to be sure, but they also want to do something entirely new and befitting of an emerging world power.  The succeed, of course, against odds so incredible that their work is perhaps as great as those of the archtects of Athens and Rome, all in record time and in marble as well as steel.  It is truly spellbinding and offers brilliant tidbits of analysis, which can only stimulate the reader to turn to other sources.<br /><br />Then there is the semi-fictionalised killer, whose cruelties transfixed America and dimmed the national tendency to unending self-congratulation.  The reader experiences the hidden terrors of two murderers, in fact.  It is a profound look at who we as human beings really are.<br /><br />The book is also written with exquisite clarity and has the unity of a novel, which is beyond the talent of most academic historians.

Books	5	24	26	N	N	final work of a great humanist	Ever since I tried to read it in college, philosophy has repelled me, or rather, I was unwilling to make the effort to get through the classic texts because they were so poorly written and abstruce.  Nonetheless, I always felt that this area was a hole in my learning and that I should have made more effort in it.  As such, it was an enormous pleasure to find Kaufmann:  he writes with an enormous clarity and grace, and to my delight, he is as disgusted with the poor writing style of modern philosphers as was I.  And he had the authority to say it, which I could never claim!<br /><br />This volume introduces the reader to three great minds, which Kaufmann sees as leading to the great psychologists if the 20C.  First, with Goethe, we find a man who broke new ground in the investigation of human psychology, bringing a poets depth and eloquence to bear.  It is so exciting and well written that Kaufmann makes the reader want to learn German and then specialize in Goethe. He is seen as an ideal of bringing poetry to the study of the mind, a tradition that waited until Freud to be renewed.  Second, he examines Kant, whom he respects but sees as a rather dry intellect, and alas, as the one who began the tradition of sloppily and hastily written modern philosophy.  But his critique goes much farther than that as we see Kant turn the mind into something abstract, immutable, and that neither evolves nor reflects the context into which it is born.  This sets philoophical inquiry into psychology, in my interpretation, on a long and infertile road that took the poetry out of the study of the mind.  Finally, with Hegel, Kaufmann sees the reintroduction of certain notions of evolution and context, but still in a way that lacks poetry.<br /><br />This is a fascinating interpretation and it is so beautifully written that many will enjoy as did I.  Warmly recommended.	2004-10-23

As with Vietnam, this book is permeated by his personal experience as a young reporter full of ambition and working hard to find a story.  The story here are the young people, who appeared as if out of nowhere in Tenessee, and entered history with their courage and dignity.<br /><br />What distinguishes this book from others on the civil rights campaign is its focus not on the most visible leaders of the fight - ML King, Malcolm X, and Medgar Evers - but on the students who served as foot soldiers and then leaders in their own right.  These were young people whose names are not household words, but whose courage and action did as much to change American society and politics as King and the others.  It is a truly amazing and inspiring story, as they started in Nashville with solid training in Ghandian non-violence techniques and then went into the deep south, where they were beaten and threatened with a viciousness that shocked the world.  In the process their audacity not only pushed a reluctant and cautious MLK to greater ambition, but they matured as political actors and many went on to outstanding careers as politicians, teachers, and preachers.<br /><br />Halberstam delineates how their non-violence and charismatic dignity in the face of these threats dovetailed with the development of television, broadcasting the brutality of the old south into the living rooms.  It was this combination - a mass movement addressing centuries-old injustices, the bad-guy thugishness of their primitivie adversaries, and TV's images - that culminated in the Civil Rights and then Voting Acts of 1965.  It is a fascinating analysis of how politics was changing at the time.<br /><br />But Halberstam doesn't stop there:  he also chronicles the  aftermath, when new \\"separatist\\" leaders emerged, like Stokely Carmichael, who split the extraordinary unity of the movement for more selfish purposes.  He also evokes the deterioration of the inner cities as the issues shift to the far more difficult and ill-defined challenges of poverty and personal identity.  It is the other half of the story - the disappointing aftermath - when lesser politicians took over and disillusionment set in after a series of terrible assasinations.  Perhaps it was inevitable, as the society digested such fundamental change and moved on to the Vietnam war period.<br /><br />Most interestingly, Halberstam follows many of these students leaders through their entire careers, which serve as the vehicles to portray the issues in the paragraph above.  We see some of them unable to sustain the intensity of their purpose, sometimes degenerating into self-destructive paths or irrelevancy as single mothers, demagogues of questionable sanity, and drug abusers.  But there were many who became great leaders, entering politics as congressmen and demonstrating that the right to vote really did change America into a more inclusive society, or becoming business men - they were able to participate fully in an integrated society, the first generation of blacks to do so.  These individual portraits are masterpieces of depth reporting and the humanistic impulse, which are the hallmarks of Halbertam's unique voice.<br /><br />This book rises to great eloquence, his best since B&B.  Warmly recommended as one of the best books I read in years.kes the deterioration of the inner cities as the issues shift to the far more difficult and ill-defined challenges of poverty and personal identity.

She chronicles the company's history of high standards and then analyses how these values were gradually traduced by greedy partners, who wished to transcend their status as \\"mere accountants\\" and enter the big leagues of consultants.  Essentially, to gain extremely lucrative contracts with such then-giants as Enron, AA lowered what were supposed to be independent auditing standards - this is the most basic conflict of interest and eventually it led to the collapse of Enron and then AA under criminal indictment.<br /><br />That is it.  You can tell that in about 20 pages, at most.  So to fill up the rest of the book, we are offered extremely dull anecdotes by Toffler, who is variously shocked, disgusted, and sometimes coopted in a corrupted culture of sleazy money-grubbers.  While she is too honest to be called selfserving in this book, she is not interesting enough to merit 240 pages.  OK, it is a bit interesting to learn what they do in those accounting/consulting groups, but again it does not merit an entire book in my opinion.  Nonetheless, her co-author, Reingold, is a good clear writer.<br /><br />That being said, now that I have read a good many sources on this book, there are gaps that must be filled elsewhere.  The authors completely missed the structural questions - that the partnership had grown so big it may no longer have been governable - and fall back on simplistic explanations like \\"greed\\".  There is no sense of evolution, of how small decisions added up to something fundamental over the long haul.  I can onlyh guess that the authors were ignorent of this.  It also alrgely neglects the changes in personnel, in particular the purges that weeded out a huge number of experienced partners in favor of rainmakers who could bring in clients.<br /><br />Recommended tepidly.	2004-10-19

I bought these in French, and studied the language - it is the best portrait of the Parisian intelligencia and middle class that I know, at least for the 1970s.  There are snapshots of life in here that are so intimate, so crazy, so realistic and yet full of satire, that they live in my mind as only the greatest writer can accomplish.  So much of it is an instant of dialogue (looking through the calender at what days are vacations; a chance meeting in a restaurant), a few seconds of someone as they get through the day (trying to put in contact lenses, stepping in dog mess), a scene in a couple's life (a quickie while watching TV, fantansies of breaking up) - the list could go on and on.  Yet these images stick with me as I get through my day, like the freelancer who submits somethign to an editor, who appears sympathetic and then puts her work right in the garbage after saying, \\"I can't promise anything...\\"  It is truly brilliant stuff, from a maladjusted observer and incredible artist of the mundane.  And each panel contains the most deliciious ironies, a comic perspective that thrusts everything into perspective at the end.  Bretecher is as good as Robert Crumb.	2004-10-19

As long as the reader is intelligent and willing to put forth the effort, he/she can gain a solid understanding of basic scientific research and where it appears to be headed.  The link, as the subtitle attests, is the impact of quantum physics on all the branches of science.  While the coverage of the physics is superior to that of molecular biology, the reader gains a vocabulary and conceptual tools for reading that can serve as an essential stepping stone for other, deeper and more specialized sources.<br /><br />This book initiated a long inquiry into science writing that influenced my career as a writer and it continues to serve as a source of inspiration for me.  Though the book is nearly 20 years old, I still refer to it for direction and the basics for many of the subjects I approach.  It is, of course, dated and cannot be taken as gospel in many subject areas, but its solid basis remains extraordinarily useful.<br /><br />The writing style is also clear and somewhat spare, never descending into the idiotic hype that became so popular in the 1990s with Wired. As such, Feinberg presents an unadorned analysis of the state of the art.  It is totally fascinating.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.	2004-10-18

Rather than write software that inevitably bogs down both in unforeseen real-world situations and from sheer volume (and unintended catastrophic breakdowns), Caudill argues that neural networks can evolve by experience and be trained, i.e. learn.<br /><br />The neural net, as I understand it, is a series of circuits that are conditioned to the things (\\"trained\\") by repetition of action.  So they can change the way they do things and supposedly \\"learn\\" as time passes.  My roboticist friends explained to me that they make \\"connections\\" similar to those that are made in the human brain.<br /><br />Where they will end up is unpredictable - they are still extremely limited machines and like traditional AI devices cannot function outside of rigid environmental confines - Caudill speculates that they will evolve into human-like complexity of mind.  A real mind.<br /><br />This enters the realm of sci-fi, I hate to say, and even quotes sci-fi for the conclusion.  Well, maybe.  Maybe not.  The human brain is the most complex object in the known universe:  they are 100 billion cells or so, and they are interconnected into networks that are the means by wich our minds function.  That network is what Caudill expects will form.<br /><br />Recommended as one point of view.  It is well written and interesting.	2004-10-13

It works great in physics, as Newton domonstrated, but less well in other disciplines such as biology and psychology.  For example, molecular biologists have isolated DNA, but have yet to adequately explain embroyonic development, protein folding and other riddles.  To overcome these shortcomings, many are calling for a theory of complexity, which should focus on systems and the dynamics of development where order appears to organize itself from a bewildering number of interacting factors.<br /><br />Gell-Mann argues that rather than replacing reductionist methods, complexity theory complements that approach.  The quark is the simple and universal, the jaguar the complex.  He suggests that between these two exists an unbroken chain.<br /><br />Gell-Mann attempts to make his contribution with teh \\"complex adaptive system\\" that \\"acquires information about its environment\\" and indentifies \\"regularities in that information\\", which are then condensed into a \\"schema\\" or \\"model\\"; these latter are \\"non-static,\\" and unlike a quark can evolve.  Each complex adaptive system contains three strands: 1) basic rules; 2) frozen accidents; 3) a selection process.  For example, language has genetically inherited cognitive capabilites with certain quirky attributes that persist and yet can change as the individual must describe new phenomena.  A lot of the book is devoted to finding and explaining similar examples.  It is a panoramic and entertaining excursion through human knowledge, if a bit cursory.<br /><br />Gell-Mann also hopes to guide scientists into a more holistic and cross-disciplinary approaches.  With its focus on historical development and links between the simple and complex, the study of complex adaptive systems, he argues, may be the spur required to stimulate such approaches, briging physics, chemistry, biology and even the social sciences.  This is what he is doing at the Santa Fe Institute.<br /><br />At its best, the book is a window into a great scientific mind, with fascinating mini-essays on state of the art science.  Unfortunately, Gell-Mann is an uneven writer.  Many passages are impenetrable to lay readers like myself.  At a deeper level, he fails to critique the vague research agendas of the complexologists, who have been ridiculously popularised in such enues as Wired.  Even the complex adaptive system may say too little about too much.  Through it all, Gell-Mann maintains his pose as a total pedant.<br /><br />REcommended.

In exchange for allowing the company to check his work for accuracy and proprietary disclosures, Werth was admitted into the inner circle of the company, with both executives and scientists, for four years.<br /><br />Werth offers masterful descriptions of both the science and the intricacies of the busisess deals.  The work is similar to that of Tracy Kidder in \\"The Soul of a New Machine\\" and, in my opinion, of the same quality.<br /><br />At the center of the story is Vertex's founding visionary, Joshua Boger, formerly a researcher at Merck.  He reasoned that instead of screening soil samples and insect secretions in a hot or miss approach in thousands of petri dishes, he could design drugs atom by atom to bind to - and thus inactivate - molecules instrumental to the disease process.  In theory, these drugs would be without side effects:  because of the precision of the design, they would adhere to their target alone, allowing beneficial enzymes of other chem reactions to go on unimpeded.<br /><br />Boger's first target molecule was FKBP, which he believed was a crucial agent of the immune system.  By blocking it, he hoped to prevent the host's body from rejecting transplanted organs.  While Boger was out raising money (eventually reaching $60 million), Vertex's researchers hunkered down to isolate and analyze  FKBP, whose molecular mechanic remained poorly understood.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what happened is a great example of the difficulties in marrying business to cutting-edge science:  after over two years of pushing themselves to the brink of nervous collapse, Vertex scientists found difficulties with FKBP.  Even worse, Boger's arch rival, a prof at Harvard, discovered why.  The prof beat VErtex, Werth argues, because he remained outside the venture capital game and could thus concentrate totally on the science and could openly collaborate with them rather than hide proprietary results.<br /><br />Nonetheless, driven and confident as ever, Boger turned his scientific team onto the new problem.  Thru all of this, Boger comes off as a fascinating character:  the son of a suicide, he is unshakably convinced that he can bend nature as well as the business world to his will.  The reader sees what lies behind the herculean efforts of him and his team.<br /><br />Warmly recommended as a rivetting tale of human endeavor that embraces the true complexity.and could thus concentrate totally on the science and could openly collaborate with them rather than hide proprietary results.   <br /> <br />Nonetheless, driven and confident as ever, Boger turned his scientific team onto the new problem.

Fox is what I call a biozealot, that is, a radical activist that opposes the development of biotechnology, any industrialization, and even bio-medical research that uses animals.  Rather than seek common ground or take a measured evaluation of what pharmaceutical companies and the governments are attempting to do - and what their concerns are - they prefer blanket, moralistic, and utterly unnuanced condemnations.<br /><br />This book is a sloppily researched and less well written version of what Jeremy Rifkin does better.  Yet both men are intolerant, misleading, and I suspect, ignorent of what positive things are being done.  Instead, they lump everyone together into a cabal run by the \\"petrochemical-pharmaceutical industrial complex,\\" which they charge wnats to dominate the world's genetic resources, etc.<br /><br />I would say that these are worthy concerns, but not in the hands of these men.  Fox and Rifkin refuse to make common cause with those within government and industry who are concnerned about the same issues and who are attempting to do the right thing.  Thus, if you want more even-handed treatment, you must go to other authors, such as Walter Anderson and Jack Doyle.<br /><br />I learned nothing from this book.  It is repetitive - often lifting whole paragraphs verbatim in subsequent chapters! - and ultimately dishonest.	2004-10-07

The authors see three ways that things get decided, and when observers confuse them, dire consequences may follow. First, there is the rational-actor who does things for explicit reasons, as if there were one decisionmaker who controls everything from conception to implementation.  Second, there is the political decision, often made for purposes of manipulation rather than for stated goals and hance are harder to read.  Third, there is bureaucratic decison-making, according to which actors on the ground carry out orders in the way that they are trained (i.e. by standard operating procedures, or SOPs).<br /><br />Basically, in my reading, they argue that these modes were mixed in the Cuban Missile Crisis - the US thinking that there was a (rational actor) policy to militarise Cuba with nuclear weapons when in fact much of the provocatively appearing construction was due to SOPs of the military who installed the missiles. Thus, the US had less to fear, but its political reality made an over-reaction inevitable.<br /><br />Now, these are very useful distinctions and the analysis is interesting.  However, they do not make for very interesting reading or very good history.  That makes this book a slog, which limits its appeal to academics rather than the general reader.  I read this for a class - otherwise, I would never have gotten through it.<br /><br />Recommended on balance, but go elsewhere if you are looking for a good story rather than a rather staid acadeimic analysis.	2004-10-07

Alas, I was sorely disappointed.  Not only are many of his observations bizarrely irrelevant, but he really didn't understand the field he was entering and was completely ignorent of the rich academic literature easily available.  His perspective as a financial journalist did him little good in this instance.<br /><br />Teitelman argues that the source of R&D finding has a decisive impact on emerging industries and to prive it he examines two examples (biotech and microelectronics).  In the days before venture capital, he argues, large corporate- or government-funded projects with deep pockets and long-term horizons developed most new technologies.  Just as Dupont took MIT research to develop synthetic fibers, so the government funded radar electronics, which catapulted Raytheon into world dominance.  Smaller entrepreneurs and inventors were blocked by conservative bankers from becoming major players.<br /><br />But by 1960, early venture capitalists began to fund tech startups; they carefully chose their companies and stuck with the entrepreneurs, which generated some phenomenal successes, such as Digital Equipment Corp.  Always a herd animal, Wall Street took notice as traditional blue chip stocks were becoming too expensive for small investors, eventually resulting in a flood of high-tech stock issues.  At first, many gadgets resulted, such as consumer micro-electronics, computers, and software.  However, the individual attention of the original venture capitalists was replaced by colder calculations of profit in the short term.  Once an industry matured or failed to pay off, they cast around for the next new thing - it was more superficial and less successful in generating new tech industries.<br /><br />So far, so good for the history.  But when the time for prescriptions comes, this book is sadly lacking in any practical advice whatsoever.  His advice is vague and off base, and he wanders into advising that an \\"ecology of technology\\" should develop, but he never defines it.  The shallowness of this reflects Teitelman's choices of source materials, which is truly appalling:  he acts as if George Gilder and John Kenneth Galbraith are the only people who have written about making profits from science!  This is so strange and ignorent that it defies belief - it is a caricature of a foolish amateur in a highly developed academic field and the result is barely at the level of a C- undergraduate term paper.  Even the examples of industries are misleading:  had he chosen aeronautics, IBM, or xerox - all of which represented iffy bets on new technologies - his conclusions might have been different.  Finally, Teitelman fails to address innumerable questions of the greatest importance, such as the value of Japan's reverse engineering of US innovations or the debates in DC about how to allow government-funded scientists to enter business with their ideas.<br /><br />Not recommended, except for the history.the history.

525863:US	48354073	R1IAU5T2MSJCZ0	0517102943	679377355	The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany	Books	5	10	14	N	N	massive work of scholarship, by an eye witness	I have looked at this book on my shelf for over 35 years.  It is so massive at 1,150 pages - I think it could stop a bullet - that it has intimidated me. So, in a moment between jobs, I took it on: it sets, in a word, THE STANDARD for all subsequent histories of one of the darkest chapters of the 20C. This is brilliant and will survive as a classic of the genre of first-rate history as written by a reporter who was there.<br /><br />The first 1/4 of the book is about the rise of Hitler. He was a bum and dreamer in Austria, had a galvinising experience as a corporal in WWI, and linked himself to bizarre and parochial right-wing nationist groups in the 1920s, which were terrible years of crisis in greater Germany. Shirer brilliantly delineates the stages of this, as Hitler stepped to the stage of an obsure Bavarian group of about 30 fanatics, to become the indisputed leader of Germany by 1933. This was a work, in a peculiar period that was not as cosmopolitan as today, that was political genius. Shirer demonstrates, without depth-psychology vocabulary, how Hitler felt what his generation suffered deeply and then articulated it in a political format. This is truly brialliant scholarship and, at times, great writing.<br /><br />The next quarter of the book is devoted to diplomatic history, from the audacious triumphs of Hitler (Munich, etc.). While it loses its psychological acuity, the international context - and what a dictator could at the time accomplish in it - comes to the fore. It is an entirely different set of circumstances from today that involved Mussolini, the weakness of Chamberlin's England, and the neutral US. While there is much about the character of the actors, such as Germany's foreign minister Ribbentrop, who is characterised too frequently as an arrogant mediocity. This is where Hitler gains parts of Poland, the Sudeten, and Austria bloodlessly.<br /><br />Then comes the last half of the book. This makes for dreary reading in two ways. First, with the Blitzkrieg and the industry to support it, Hitler is momentarily triumphant. He takes France and Norway and the low countries with extraodinary speed, shocking a world mired in economic depression. This new war tactic involved tanks, airplanes that dominated the airspace to cut supply lines and communications, and quick movement of troops by rail or truck as they overwhelmed their confused adversaries by encirclement. As a fully developed system, it was a totally new form of warfare, and it took the great power France by surprise.<br /><br />Second, once Germany attacked the USSR, the war became one of attrition, a more traditional form along the lines of WWI. The USA entered and the vast resoures of the USSR created the traditional nightmare for Germany of a two-front war. It became a question of resources then, and Germany was essentially lost. The unbelievably vast machinery then set itself in motion to smash Nazi Germany, and it was then, as de Gaulle said, only a matter of time.<br /><br />So the last 1/3 of the book is about Nazi Germainy's mistakes and collapse. It is dreary reading, and has an inevitability about it that makes for boring reading. This was a slog and I have had enough of German history for at least two years!<br /><br />Shirer also covers what happended in Germany and then in the occupied countries. It was ugly and so well known that I will not go into it here except to say that modern Germany is no longer so parochial and this kind of thing can never happen again.<br /><br />Shirer is not perfect. His work is bound to its time, the 40-60s. He calls the SA, for example, \\"homosexual perverts\\". This is a traditional view of the times, but it dates the book. Nonetheless, this work sets the standard for all follolwing scholarship, and that makes it a classic. His writing style is clear and very personal.<br /><br />All is all, warmly recommended as a great work of scholarship, with many personal asides that add character and honesty t the work.

For more than 2000 years, philosophers and scientists have attempted to use symbolic logic to investigate the structure of language and, by extension, the human mind.  Our speech and thought processes, they believe, operate according to underlying rules that are rigorously mathematical.  Devlin argues that this approach is a dead end and that we should pursue new avenues of research.<br /><br />Much of the book is a critique of symbolic logic.  Invented by Aristotle, it was merged with algebra and became a branch of mathematics and its most recent applications have been in artificial intelligence (AI) as well as the liguistic of Chomsky.  What these disciplines have in common - what is \\"cartesian\\" about them - is their attempt to \\"captur[e] patterns of reasoning...in a pure fashion, isolated from context\\" and even meaning.  In this view, computers are the perfect logic machines, processing info by manipulating symbols without understanding what they are doing.<br /><br />The failure of AI to meet its original goals demonstrates, in Devlin's view, what is wrong with this approach.  AI (or an \\"expert system\\") lacks common sense, whatever its daignostic capabilities, and cannot make judgments when unforseen or ambiguous situations arise.  Consequently, AI cannot operate outside extraordinarily narriow confines and hence are unreliable in many applications.  Computers have also failed to produce a human-like language.  This is proof, Devlin says, that the human mind is more than a logic machine (\\"Smart meat\\" as the WIred crowd might argue) that acts according to rigid subsystems of logical rules:  context and meaning matter.  These arguments are convincing and cogently argued.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Devlin's arguments of where to go from there are far weaker than his analyses of past failures.  The last third of the book is a loose jumble of idaes and speculation.  He wants to create  a \\"soft math\\" to incorporate context, meaning, and the qualitative into the study of the human mins, but does not get beyond saying we need it.  THis is a research agenda, but too vague to be of much use in my opinion.  Of course, maybe I am expecting too much and his next book will cover that!<br /><br />Unfortunately, his writing style is repetitive and gets bogged down in elaborate proofs and thought experiments - just the type of arcane stuff that keeps (or bars) many of us from reading more by academics.<br /><br />So this is a mixed bag.  The ideas on the human mind are well worth the effort, but getting through it is not fun, at least for me.f the human mins, but does not get beyond saying we need it.

Broad reports on how the mysteries of the deepest oceans are opening up to our eyes with mini-supersubs, sonar devices, and robots.  Much of this revolution is due, he says, to the end of the Cold War, which allowed us to put them to scientific rather than miltary purposes.<br /><br />The world they discovered may harbor the most diverse forms of life on the planet, in environments hostile beyone imagination.  Broad introduces us to an incredible gallery of exotic creatures, from hypothermophiles - bacteria that live in lava-heated water of 400 degrees F - to countless species of squid and manowars.  Braod also accompanies treasure hunters as they explore for ancient artifacts and rare minerals.<br /><br />THe book is part history, part primer in technology, and part environmental tract, and the skill with which Broad combines these concerns whows why he won the Pulitzer twice.  It is also poetically written.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.  This book can ignite the imagination for a lifetime.	2004-09-06

The hubble telescope was the most complex piece of scientific equipment that was ever built to operate off of Earth.  From its initial \\"mistake\\" in a poorly honed hyperbolic mirror - its \\"correction\\" became a major media event that nearly busted Nasa's budget - to the innumerable failing subsystems in constant need of adjustment, its success is something of a phenomenon.<br /><br />But a success it indisputably was, one of the greatest in the history of human endeavor and easily the equal to, say, the creation of the Gothic cathedral.  Images from the telescope have become so uniquitous, such as its use as background in Star Trek, that we would be shocked if they disappeared.  Of course, the advancement of virtually all fields of astronomy that it spawned will enrich us forever.  Not only can we plumb the composition of stars and search for planets more accurately, but such scientific givens as the Hubble constant are coming into question with the precision measurements not coming available.  Even amateurs, if they come up with an interesting proposal, can get a crack at making scientific history.<br /><br />Peterson and Brandt cover these developments competently and clearly, with gorgeous photos throughout the book to add to its wonder.  While they do not cover they public policy angle alll too well, the science is enough (even if it gets a bit too gee-whiz for my taste at times).<br /><br />Warmly recommended.	2004-09-06

Davies is one of the great popularisers who NEVER indulges in hype or wild speculation, but instead sticks to the science.

It is largely a history of how consumer electronic products have gradually become more sophisticated in their design from the early 1980s or so.  Breaking them down by product category, it also offers a thumbnail sketch of the business considerations that went into some of the decisions.  I wanted more depth, to be sure, but I enjoyed the reading of this immensely as I am a certified design nut.  If you are a scholar looking for something more exhaustive, I don't know where to send you.  It is very nicely written and the illustrations are gorgeous.<br /><br />Recommended.	2004-09-02

It does not go into excessive scientific detail, but explains the gist in a truly masterful popularization.  I am sure that scientists will find the treatment too light, but for the general reader it is perfect in my view.<br /><br />Newton essentially created a new kind of mathematics, which came to be known as calculus.  It involved the use of infinities to describe certain shapes and so was a great break with previous mathematical assumptions.  In what can only be called a work of genius, Newton then applied this mathematics to the motion of the planets, positing the force of gravity as the explanation for why it all held together.  Newton also did fundamental experiments in optics, which reflected his remarkable ability to observe and record/descirbe what he saw in scientific language.  Gleick also explores Newton's involvement in strange strains of mysticism, a remnant of the middle ages and unlike the Enlightenment with which he came to be associated.<br /><br />On a personal level, Newton was a solitary man with no apparent romantic relationships.  Gleick does not speculate on is sexuality and avoids other areas about which we cannot know.  Late in life, he became rich as a controller of the currency for the Crown.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  Gleick is a science writer of great talent.	2004-08-26

I greatly admire the other volumes of the series, not only for their value as iconoclastic evocations of American history, but as novels in themselves with vibrant and fascinating characters.  Vidal is, simply put, one of America's greatest living artists.  His voice is unique and unmistakable. In other volumes, his personal views are hidden and cryptic, which is great fun as the reader is kept guessing.  Alas, in this one, I found his views to be baldly plain and that the characters were used as vehicles to serve these ideas.  This terribly weakens its value as a work of art.  Instead, it often reads like one of his essays.<br /><br />In my reading, Vidal is arguing that FDR saw WWII as the only way to stay in power, a life-saving decision as there was nothing else of intimate value in his life.  To do so, he took a giant step in creating the \\"national security state,\\" which upon his death in office an unwitting Truman completed.  Now in my view, this is a simplistic reading of a bewilderingly complex period, a watershed if you will.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Vidal succeeded in getting me to question my assumptions, and that I think is of the greatest value and the unique contribution that an historical novel can relate.  That saved the reading experience for me, which was more wooden than Vidal's previous accomplishments.  Perhaps it is Vidal's talent that got him to create this as a crucial moment in American foreign policy, in which our involvement in such places as Irak are under scrutiny and our ideals are distrusted by the very allies that are supposed to benefit from them.  It is an age of the most profound disillusionment and Vidal is providing the art that reflects this period.<br /><br />Finally, the swansong machinations of the Sanfords are wonderful to follow.  Also, the fate of Clay - the JFK-like villain of \\"Washington, DC\\" - is also advanced.  It is a fitting conclusion to one of the great cycles of novels of this age. There are, of course, many hilarious moments in which the manners of the ruling class are dissected and exposed for questioning.  In his hands, their vanities are so human, and this is a good thing.<br /><br />Warmly - and this time cerebrally - recommended.ycles of novels of this age.

It has great scholarly value in that its suppositions are based on documents that were unearthed by the Freedom of Information Act from the FBI and other groups that investigated the shady dealings of the Soongs for various American politicians.  The result is a convincing argument, in my view, that:  1) the Soongs (with few exceptions) were brutal thugs bent on power and money with little regard to the welfare of the people of China; 2) General Chiang was from the start the creature of the Green Gang gangsters, the only constant loyalty he exhibited in a life of sleazy vacillation; 3) many Americans, from the Luces to Wilkie (thought not FDR or Truman), were their dupes.  Because of the new documentary sources, this argument gains new relevence here with all the new proof.  It is both sad and pathetic to see how Americans deluded themselves, eventaully at the cost of millions of Chinese lives, to pursue the crude PR illusions that the charming Soongs and Chiang Kai Shek spun.<br /><br />Only one of the three Soong sisters comes off well.  As they said:  \\"one of them loved money, one of them loved power, and one of them loved China.\\"  It is a truly devastating indictment.<br /><br />There are a lot of things that this book is not, and one of them is a \\"balanced view\\" that advances counter arguments for the other opinion, that is, Luce's and others like him.  As such, it will appear biased to some.  It also does not present a general view of the historical period, which if the reader lacks one would make it far less valuable as an intro to a complex period in China's development.  That menas this book is really in the province of scholars and their arguments, which are beyond my interest in many respects.  Finally, this is also not an in-depth psychological biography.  You don't feel like you get to know who they were and why the acted the way they did.<br /><br />Recommended for all serious students of China.

The book is so spare that it is hard to understand the horror without reading it so slowly that you are practically reading it aloud.  There are really vivid characters in it, who evolve in just a few paragraphs, a truly masterful encapsulation.  While there is nothing particularly remarkable about his writing style, Wiesel has created a classic here that will stand the test of time.  It is so scary and devastating that I will never forget it.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.	2004-08-24

From a charmed life as a screenwriter, she fell to the bottom more quickly than she could have imagined possible.  I found this to be the least successful of her series of memoires, in which she re-made herself and re-entered the spotlight as a good if not truly distingusihed writer.  However, the topic is more focused than the other volumes, in particular focusing on the travials of her friend, Dashell Hammett.  This is very moving.  In fact, I found the best part of the book was the introduction by Garry WIlls, who is a truly first-rate political writer.  His depiction of the time, made more vivid by his self-identification as a conservation, is chilling and comic at the same time - he recalls how Ayn RAND said that any film with Russians even smiling was propaganda and hence punishable by law!<br />Recommended, but there are better and far more comprehensive histories of the period.	2004-06-22

This book, written in response immediately following the 9/11 attacks, demonstrates that she has lost none of her political passion.  It is as if she vomitted it all out in a single sitting, which is not too far off the mark as she says she lived on coffee and didn't sleep for weeks while she wrote.<br />On the one hand, there is her outrage at what occured, not only with the Muslim world that spawned such dangerous fundamentalists, but also at the reactions of the politicians in the West and in particular in Europe.  All I can say is that her condemnations are not terribly nuanced:  there is no acknowledgment of moderate moslems and no patience with the all-too-human hypocracy of the \\"critics\\" of the US.  While this is rather tiresome after a while, it should not overshadow the fact that her perspective and experience as a celebrated journalist are indeed unique and penetrating.  But her rhetoric all too easily soars to excess.  In a diatribe against colored immigrants in Italy, for example, she flatly charges that they don't work much, that they routinely indulge in sexual assault, and that they cannot be absorbed into Italian civilization but will instead destroy it.  That is certainly not racist, but there is real bile there.<br />On the other hand, she gives some wonderful glimpses into her mind and its development, from the moral integrity of her parents to her meetings with such world leaders as the Dalai Lama (he gets an A+) or Yassar Arafat (D-).  In a way, I wish that she would write a memoir.  Also, she lets on that she has terminal cancer, that she loves New York, that America is the guarantor of the West's freedom.  It is a good performance and highly interesting.<br />I read this in Italian and really enjoyed the language:  vivid and full of bite, very useful for the development of vocabulary.<br />Recommended.	2004-06-16

Unlike his other books, which all to often get lost in sensuous detail, this one is a perfect balance of analysis and portraits of the quirkiness of the human condition.  In other words, you get a flavor for the vast array of people involved, while the narrative follows well trod lines.  It is an immensely complex story.  The result is a masterpiece and truly great.<br />Schama's take on the Revolution is that what happened was far more richly textured than the crude class-based analyses that have held sway for too long.  In what I believe is a convincing performance, he shows that not only was (the politically inept) Louis XVI pursuing many progressive agendas for change, but that it was the aristocrat-intellectuals who formed the basis of the Revolutionary leadership and not bourgeois or working class heroes.  What made it so violent, in this reading, was the collapse of the old order and then the struggles that ensued for the control of the instruments of military and police power.  It was the birth of the popular army, he concludes, and not the abstract ideals enshrined in official propaganda, that was the real legacy of the Revolution and the basis for Napoleon's later military dominance.<br />What makes it all such a watershed event was that it was the first example of the passions unleashed by nationalist fanaticism:  the jacobans led directly to the communards and then the more purified revolutionary violences of fascism and marxist-leninism.  Reading of the horrors of the Terror, this is also convincing (and frightening).<br />One of the greatest pleasures of this book is the personalities that Schama describes in loving detail, as they appear and re-appear at crucial moments.  You get the heavyweights Lafayette and Talleyrand, but also innumerable lesser known characters, whose lives and fates the author takes to symbolise the Revolution's legacy.  If you know Paris, you learn who a lot of the people were whose names are on the streets and the institutions, such as Necker and de la Tour du Pin.  That made it especially fun for me, but that is personal.<br />That being said, the book is occasionally uneven.  Though Schama tells a great story in the most elegant of prose, there are sections that read as if it were written too fast.  Moreover, the story is so complex that some basic details, such as what the people in the various factions actually thought and stood for, are lost or obscured by the endless succession of stories.<br />Warmly recommended.the people were whose names are on the streets and the institutions, such as Necker and de la Tour du Pin.

I just found this novel kind of wierd, and then the apocalypse was sudden, etc.  There are many of Vonnegut's typical themes:  socially inept people (&quot;losers&quot; in the glitzy American sense) who gain positions of influence/power in obscure places and try to do good, banal science that started out inadvertantly and became very deadly, and speculations about how people should treat eachother.

Duhamel follows his career from his origins as a center-right politician under the 4th Republic to the Presidency as a leftist in the 5th.  Along the way, the reader gets to know him in his full ambiguity and complexity.  FOr example, though a conservative of the center right, once political institutions changed fundamentally in the (presidential) 5th Republic - ending his career as a rising minister in the legislative regime of the 4th - Mitterrand read some left-wing political philosophy and concluded, \\"there are ideas and everything here.  I can win this.\\"  He then did, bcoming president - possibly the most powerful position in any Western democracy - nearly 20 years later.<br /><br />But his political strategy is not all that is here.  I learned  innumerable things that I didn't know:  he was a connoisseur of Romanesque church details, which he surveyed when he got the chance during political junkets.  Or take the existence of his secret second family, which he housed at taxpayer expense in a public chateau and that attended his funeral along with his legitimate family.  But his political legacy is also covered well, in the ways in which Mitterrand expanded certain freedoms and encouraged the development of alternate centers of power to the presidency.

Sometimes I get tired of how many pathetic characters there are in Nabokov's novels and that was the case with this one; it is set among the emigre set perpetually mourning the loss of tzarist Russia, which is of limited interest.  Moreover, for sticklers (and lovers) of Nabokov's inimitable style, this is a translated work and as with virtually all of the others, something is lost - I found it very flat, almost two dimensional.<br />Recommended tepidly, but true Nabokov devotees will probably like it.	2004-05-25

Gould's writing is so masterful and clear that it is simply stunning to read.  Gould comes across as a great humanist, respectful of the points of view of others - even the Creationists - and erudite in only the way a lover of knowledge can be.  I have studied his writing style for years:  it is elegant, spare yet sensual, and continually reformulates ideas is new ways, that is, rarely repetitive.  Unlike his later essays, which covered quirkier details in increasingly lugubrious attempts to get at the broader notions he cherished, these essays are fresh and light, in my view amoung the best of the entire series.<br />As an introducer of popular notions and as a scientist, I believe that Gould will be remembered as a genius.

This book was a big deal in my early teens.

I read it over and over, the first book I ever savored, the last time in 1973.<br /><br />In a way, I wish I hadn't re-read this.  What I see today is a mediocre novel of some substance but ultimately a flimsy reading experience.  The writing is weak, the tone and message feel dated, badly at times.  I suppose I wasn't surprised to be disappointed, since in many ways I read for a living.<br /><br />The book is about Billy Pilgrim, an everyman trying to make a life in his own bewildered way, thrown into WWII as a boy and brought haphazardly  through life as an &#34;unstuck&#34; time traveler, forever re-visiting the past and future of his life.  There is a science fiction aspect to it, also very weak when compared to the greats in the genre.  As a time traveler, he develops a weirdly passive philosophy, basically letting things happen because they must, which is very close to his experience of life.  It's fun in a 1960s kind of way, but appears superficial now.<br /><br />The novel is non-linear, all over the place and attempting advance several narratives at one time; as such, it develops little in the way of emotional involvement, giving it a superficial feel with 2-dimensional characters and an almost idiotically naive pacifism reflecting American angst about the Vietnam War.<br /><br />In the end, I think this is a kid's book, a kid in the 1970s.  I do not think it is a novel that will intrigue anyone beyond scholars of the 1960s.  That is how I recommend this.	2004-05-20

It is a typical frivolous 70s-style story, posturing as a more genuine 1960s anti-establishment statement but really just baldly commercial.<br />The plot is full of characters that are 2-dimensional sterotypes, from the neurotic Indian advertising artist to the guru in the desert.  With its breathtaking pretentions, it is not even as good as a TV sitcom.<br />Not recommended.  Watch Mork &amp; Mindy or re-runs of the original Saturday night live instead, if you want a genuine 70s experience.	2004-05-19

While the story is centered around the development of the Steel industry in the Ruhr Gebiet in Germany, it is also about German history - from its beginnings with the &#34;forest mythology&#34; of the Roman era - all the way up to the 1960s.  Unusual for historians, Manchester also has a wonderful grasp of character, which the Krupp family supplied in many, many bizarre variations over several generations.  The result is a read of the greatest quality.<br />Most important, there is the empire of Krupp, as built up by Alfred.  At 14, he inherited a steel company that had dwindled under his father's inept management to 5 employees.  By sheer grit and a genius for profitable technical innovation, he built it into a vast conglomerate so powerful that it could literally make empires fall.  In particular, the company specialised in the development of weapons, from breach-loading cannons to early prototypes for tanks.  He even created a cannon (the Big Bertha for his wife), braced along the side of an entire mountain, that could hurl projectiles deep into France from German soil.  The details are fascinating, with graceful descriptions that translate their engineering details for laymen.<br /><br />Alfred controlled everything, from scribbling rules to govern the work force with a pencil nub to relationships with the various ministers of war throughout Europe.  There are hilarious scenes where he dines once a year with Bismarck, a great personal friend, and their hysterical laughter at the latter's remark about Napoleon III of France (&#34;Eigentlich ist er dumm&#34;).  His drive was so unrelenting that his many failures, such as an early insult to a crucially important aristocrat in the defense ministry (creating a problem for himself that lasted 30 years), took an enormous personal toll - he spent days in bed, depressed and immobile after a failed sale, and his family was a horrible mess.<br />A large part of the book is about his search for an heir who can run the family business.  Here too, the characters are remarkable and often as hilarious or pathetic as their continuing genius for business.  One of them was a notorious homosexual, who created an entire bacchanal in a Southern Italian castle for young boys, shooting fireworks for every climax, and when it was discovered - it was illegal in Germany - he committed suicide.  You also witness the family energy dissipating until the last generation, when it became a public company with the appointment of Berthold Beitz.  (Here there is some personal pique in the author, who writes that the last son, also gay, was &#34;an indolent fool.&#34;)<br /><br />The tableau is so rich that it covers the many moral ambiguities of the times, such as supplying rival powers who would turn Krupp weapons on eachother, including enemies of Germany, and of course the Nazi period is examined.  Through all of this, the Krupp do not come off well, even using slave labor by Hitler's victims.  (The only criticism I have of the book is the excessive coverage of the Holocaust, which occupies several chapters of personal stories, indicting the last Krupp who was briefly imprisoned and then released to run the company in the 1950s.)<br />As a business writer, it was a great pleasure to read such a rivetting business story.

I think that this has happened with John Cheever, from the retrospective praise of his work to our fascination with his bisexuality and persistent alcoholism.  Indeed, his personal demons are far more interesting than his prose.<br />While I read isolated stories in mags and liked them, reading them in a lump like this makes his weaknesses seem very plain indeed.  His stories almost all revolve around a common plot:  things in the suburbs don't turn out the way we want, and most often, a lot of alcohol does little to soften the blow of deteriorating reliationships, alienated children, and nothing to do in retirement.  When you read 20 stories like that in a row, Cheever appears as a feeble writer indeed.  This a throwaway magazing writing, not some timeless achievement that should enter the pantheon.<br />Not recommended.	2004-05-14

While it is very interesting to trace how their minds developed - how they mastered and began to question the works of the masters of antiquity in a manner far more daring than the scholars of the Renaissance - it is so encylopediac that it impedes the narrative.  In other words, I got bored and literally set it down for years.  However, this is the work of a first-rate historian and so may have been too sophisticated for an amateur like me.  (I like history, but this guy has READ EVERYTHING in the original, which I cannot.)  Once I picked it up again, I did indeed enjoy it.  Rather heavy handedly, Gay argues that what they concluded was that Christianity was a fiction and could not be true.  Readers should know this.  While I am somewhere on the spectrum between atheism and agnosticism, what I interpreted as Gay's atheism is even a bit too much for me.<br />I learned an immense amount about this period here, perhaps the most pivotal of the modern world.  While a bit much, if taken in the right way it is a great guide to many of the debates that continue to this day and that originated with these intellectuals.  However, I look forward to the next book, which is about what they did in a practical institutional sense rather than what and how they thought (covered by this first volume).<br />Recommended, but it is serious scholarly study rather than vacation reading!	2004-05-11

In an instant, I was transported into the sad yet zany and hopeful world of Maggie:  she meddles and fumbles, but has a good heart and never really messes anything up seriously.  All of these lives are displayed with an arresting charm, through illusions, lost hopes, and the real value that there can be in a marriage that lasts in spite of all its frustrations and even its mediocrity.  At least for me, this is very very moving and nakedly realistic, even wise.  It is also charming in Tyler's hands and often comic without ever traducing the realism.  Indeed, this novel has all of the virtues that &quot;Amateur&quot; lacked and I think it is a far better performance that addresses many of the same realities - just with characters that are more likable, more interesting, more fun.<br />Warmly recommended as a masterpiece of the mundane.  Tyler makes Baltimore - of all places! - immortal.  I loved it.	2004-05-11

Not only was it viewed as a peripheral Cold War conflict, which encouraged the US to support notoriously corrupt and brutal regimes, but it was also a series of extremely complex dynamics in small sovereign nations that virtually no one knew much about.  El Salvador, along with Guatamala and pre-Sandinista Nicaragua, was one of the worst countries \\"down there.\\"<br /><br />This book offers an intimate portrait of a gathering revolution, cataloguing the injustices and casual brutalites in a frightening indictment.  The bottom line is that a layer of evil people simply must be swept away and the US has no business standing in the way of it.  In other words, it is the classic argument for \\"indiginous revolution,\\" dismissing the claims of cold warriors that the revolutionaries are communists supported by Moscow, etc.  While this is only of historical interest, it is a useful case study of misguided policy, which we would do well to study today.<br /><br />The stories in the book are truly horrible.  One young army officer, for example, raped a young aristocrat but was let off from prosecution because he appeared \\"promising.\\"  As scary as they are, I have since discovered that some of them are inaccurate.  For example, the future president of El Salvador, whose name I think was Napoleon Duarte, was reported to have been tortured and that the tips of his fingers on one hand were cut off during interrogation.  It turns out that he lost them as a construction worker.  This diminishes the credibility of the book somewhat, but it is still very powerful.<br /><br />Recommended for a look at the COld War mentality and as a guide to the self-deception that can go on in Washington DC.	2004-05-10

The other stories are lifted from her novels in truncated form, kind of pasted in to inflate the size into a book rather than the single story of the title; this is a bit cheap.<br />Nonetheless, the quality of the Djinn story is simply exceptional, a five-star performance that is perceptive, funny, hopeful, and sad.  The protagonist is a middle-aged divorcee, whose entire life is displayed in a single magical instant that transforms her - but not her fate.  The images are fabulously well drawn, unforgettable really, and will remain engraved in my memory for the rest of my life.  Moreover, the subtlety of the encounter with the supernatural is full of delicious ambiguities and a peek into the fantastic that is one of the best I have ever encountered.  I loved it, laughed, and felt wonder all at the same moment.<br />So I would warmly recommend this book, so long as the reader knows that the rest of it is somewhat disappointing.	2004-05-09

It is the story of a woman on a search for her child in an alien environment, where she amazes people by killing a running chicken by grabbing its neck, allowing herself to be seduced by an ex-husband, and finally putting herself in danger.  While what is happening is under-stated, it adds up to a bunch of scenes that I just found confusing and not too interesting.

Early on, he set out to be an independent intellectual, constantly learning and living in his \\"own way.\\"  He succeeded, in spite of the odds, on the terms that he set out for himself.  This was deeply inspiring to me, and it turned out that despite the surface differences of interest, Alan Watts had a lot to say about the choices one makes in life and how to go about living.<br />The book is also filled with details that are as fascinating as they are hilarious.  A friend of his youth made a pilgrimage to a famous and ancient monastery, which he discovered was \\"an elaborate homosexual organization.\\"  Though he lacked a university degree, Watts was allowed to study at Northwestern, which he described as \\"the type of place where philosphers worked from 9 to 5.\\"  Later, in LA, he hung out with Aldous Huxley, experimenting with hallucinogens, beating drums all night long, and listening to the incredible rhythm of that brilliant man's speech, which he says arrested all conversation in entire restaurants.

He is a kind of spiritual mentor to a new species of humans, perhaps the only survivors - besides his mysterious presence - of some plague or war that completely wiped out modern civilisation.  Along the way, he is harassed by genetically engineered beasts with frighteningly enhanced characteristics as well as his memories of a hard life with little love.<br />This sense of mystery, and the revelations that eventually build a fairly complete picture of what might have happened, make this a rivetting and fascinating read.  The novel pulses with life and despair, very realistic psychologically in my opinion, which is what the best science fiction can do (such as the incomparable Octavia Butler).  Though some reviewers have criticized her avoidance of explaining more completely the characters of Oryx and Crake, I think that she leaves just enough unsaid to stimulate the imagination; I liked what she left out.  I simply could not put the book down and read it late into the night, aided by jet lag insomnia.<br />In terms of the science in the book, Atwood makes a very good and consistent interpretation of trends that are visible now.  While I am more skeptical about how soon (if ever) genetic material will be decifered in a truly engineerable way - the public is largely unaware of how crude most biotech experiments really are -  her vision is most definitely worth noting:  it is thoughtful and alarmingly human, if hyperbolic to the point of satire.<br />This is the first book I read by Atwood. I must admit that I find her writing style uneven:  clear and vivid, by somehow lacking fluidity and elegance.  But she is a very powerful novelist and visionary and I will definitely read more.<br />Warmly recommended.br />Warmly recommended.	2004-05-06

Bush	Books	4	49	64	N	N	not that I needed convincing, but this is a GREAT indictment	For the first time in my life, I feel true fear for the future of American democracy, and it was this book that made me look this question in the face.  Dean argues that Bush and his minions are systematically undermining the institutions and practices that we have taken for granted since at least the early 1950s:  American politics, we believe with ardent complacency, are inherently self-correcting and will eventually eliminate the rare excesses like the McCarthy era or the Nixonian dirty-tricks campaign.<br />It ain't necessarily so, Dean argues with great, great power.  Dean makes a compelling case that this administration, through a combination of arrogance and demagogy in the political advantage it has taken of the terrorist crisis, is unprecedented in its attempts to subvert the constitution.  This could change the very structure of American institutions, restricting our civil liberties in perhaps fundamental and permanent ways.  At the very least, this argument deserves serious consideration by all of us rather than uncritical acceptance by Bush haters or casual dismissal by Bush lovers.  Other reviews have covered the details of his arguments so I will not reiterate them here.<br />While acknowledging the dangers, Dean is relatively sanguine about the future of American democracy.  Bush has made so many enemies, he argues, that once a scandal truly breaks, Bush's fall could be extremely brutal.  And a scandal, in his view, is an inevitable accompaniment to the mediocrity and sloppiness that the excessive secrecy of the Bush Administration nutrtures.  I hope he is right.<br />Recommended for anyone concerned with the direction of the country.  One very good thing about this book is that it is written at a most inclusive level, so many basic things about American history and how our institutions function are explained clearly and succinctly, which should stimulate appetites for more.  This is a great service, in my opinion.	2004-05-05

In a perfect economy or detail, the curious reader can explore the modalities of all these disciplines as they are practiced today.  It is useful and indeed fascinating.  I know of no better source for those interested in these issues.<br />For example, according to Heskett, there are product design companies that rely on single maestros - designers celebiritries such as Philippe Starck.  Then, there are team-based groups springing up in the US, like IDEO, that can design anything very quickly on demand, from toothbrush handles to Palm Pilots.  Finally, there are sepcialised design groups within corporations, some of which act like consultencies that have to bid for business in competition with outside competitors (this occurs in Philips).  Heskett does the same for graphic design, public relations, etc., so there is much here for those seeking specific answers to certain questions as well as a larger contextual overview.<br />It is nice to find a design book that is not a picture book, but one based on content and analysis.  I will consult this for years to come for its holistic perspective on the multi-faceted disciplines that make up &quot;design.&quot;<br />Recommended warmly.	2004-05-05

There was young love and then some deeper love, in spite of all the senseless agitation and petty fighting.<br />Unlike her previous novels, with their wonderful humor and tragedy in the mundane, none of the characters are endearing or interesting.  Beyond his grocery store, the husband admits to himself that he has no interests, no friends, and is unhappy in his rigid routines from always preferring meat and potatoes to his hatred of travel.  In contrast, his wife is very social, loves to cook, expresses her anger immediately rather than stew in it interminably, and is dying for variety as life passes her by.  As a couple, they never develop common interests and never seem to accomodate their differences, living instead with raw, oozing wounds.  It all adds up to a distressingly bleak and realistic portrayal of the nihilism at the center of so many marriages.  Quite simply, these people are pathetic together and there isn't much that is funny about it.<br />That is about it.  I do not mean to say that this is not a good novel. Tyler has great talent. However, beyond the many insights in it, I did not find any pleasure in the reading.  Moreover, the frame of the novel is a straight narrative over 50 years of so, shifting personal perspectives; this is not too imaginative.<br />Recommended for serious Tyler fans and lovers of dreary marriage fiction.	2004-05-04

She did one thing, over and over, refining it over a long and productive career at Pratt, in Brooklyn. As such, I believe that it would best be used in the classroom, rather than as a simple read for those who want to understand modern design.  Being ignorent about issues in studio design - really doing it, rather than observing it like I do - I got a lot out of it.  But I will need to refer to it and read through many more times to truly absorb the exercises.  For what it is, the book is a masterpiece as an exercise in visual thinking and the method left its imprint on many of the greatest American designers from before WWII to the 1980s.<br />Recommended, but for designers rather than design critics.	2004-05-04

They all want to own him in some way, which simply doesn't make sense as there is nothing interesting about him whatsoever.  He just blunders on, into greater and more improbable situations, none of which I found funny in the slightest.  It is like reading a novel by Eugene Ionescu, without the humor and surrealism.<br />In other words, I just didn't get it and don't think it is worth the effort.  I would never have gotten through it except for the fact that I grabbed it for a long flight and had nothing else to read.<br />Not recommended.	2004-05-03

You get a kind of blow by blow report of Clinton's tumultuous first year in the White House with virtually no analysis and context, but instead just raw description.  I was appalled at how much trash was in it.<br />The one nugget I took away was that in that first year, Clinton spent too much time chatting with aides due to his &quot;lack of discipline&quot; and enjoyment of exercising his mind with the extraordinary grasp he had of policy.  But there is no exploration of his character, and indeed ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the details of the policies he was attempting to advance.  As such, this book is like so much election journalism of today:  covering the horse race but not the issues.<br />Not recommended, except for academics doing deep research.	2004-04-04

Stories are also interwoven in the book is a useful and interesting, indeed fascinating, way and greatly add to the text rather act as filler.  Indeed, this is one of the few biz books I know that is worth reading all the way through, whereas most can be digested solely from reading the cover blurbs or at most the first chapter.<br />Simply put, Collins et al advocate putting the right people in the right place (&quot;on the bus&quot;), then carefully developing a simple and utterly clear vision of where to go (&quot;hedgehog concept&quot;), and finally to make incremental steps that add up into major breakthroughs (&quot;moving the flywheel&quot;).  Time and again, I have seen this pattern in the great companies that I have been in, from China and Italy to the US:  you get a great leader who is tough yet fair and self-effacing, who develops a common vision through trial and error, and then people join in of their own accord and work extremely hard to realize their common vision.  This book offers a framework to analyse these ideas systematically and I will use it for years to come.<br />Highly recommended.  However common-sensical this all may sound, everyone can learn from this, particularly in the detailed stories, but also in the lists of ideas.	2004-04-02

Well, this is one book that I think is really excellent - for content, for clarity, for sincerity, for the stories reported in it.<br /><br />When I plow through a business book, I try to see if I can remember the central ideas, the essence of what the author has to say from the mass of details and stories that make up every business book.  Most often, they are appalingly banal and pathetically over-applied, touted as able to solve just about every problem, in particular if a fee is paid to the authors to come and talk about it in person.  I was preparted to treat this book the same way, and was simply delighted to find a truly excellent and useful book.  And gee, I am glad that I can get inspired by a book in my chosen field, rather than bored!<br /><br />As I see it, this book has three principal ideas.  First, we must think of organizations and their missions as complex systems rather than as conglomerations of isolated problems.  It is pitch for the development of a holistic view - how everything interacts and what factors act upon what other factors.  This is an analytical tool that can pinpoint what should be done, breaking mental habits of looking only at the bottom line of sales revenues, for example, rather than the need to provide better service or delivery times.  Second, employees must be empowered to make their own decisions locally, requiring honesty and openness throughout the organization as standard practice.  This enables them to question and learn, not just individually but as part of a unified team, hence the subtitle of a learning organization.  Mistakes are part of this process and should be allowed as valid experiments.  Third, the task of a leader is to design an organizational system within which this can all be accomplished.  Rather than control all decisions in a centralized manner in accordance with a rigid plan, the leader must develop a vision of where they organization should go and then allow his employees to pursue that vision as a team with great autonomy.<br /><br />I have wanted to read this book for almost ten years.  It was first pointed out to me by a remarkable business leader in mainland China, Zhang Ruimin, the founder of the Haier Group, as a seminal text for him.  He said that he had built a learning organization in accordance with Senge's prescriptions, and after so many years, I see that indeed he did.  What this book did for me was to give me a better idea of Zhang's mind and what went on in it.  But it has also given me a clearer idea of many other remarkable entrepreneurs whom I have had the pleasure and honor to meet over the years in my work.  As Senge explained, these men had a vision, but used the gap that existed between their vision and current reality to inspire their workers to achieve remarkable things.  And they created self-reinforcing systems to do so.<br /><br />Another fascinating aspect of this book is that, in spite of being nearly 15 years old, it felt fresh and its examples did not feel stale and in need of updates.  Many books that old extoll Japan as the model to emulate and explain why that country does everything better than everyone else. Just take a look at Porter's books! While this book has some examples from Japan, it does not fall into that trap - for me, that means its analyses have stood the test of time.<br /><br />This is one of the best business books I ever read - and I have read way way too many of them!  Warmly recommended.n, the leader must develop a vision of where they organization should go and then allow his employees to pursue that vision as a team with great autonomy.

It is also a fascinating experiment in expanding the literary vehicle, adding the dimension of the cards - functioning as kind of symbolic building blocks as well as a springboard for association - that creates a parallel narrative to the gorgeous descriptive power of the work.  Calvino, I feel, has created a work as complex and rich as the best of Nabokov.  As with all truly great novels, there is a great deal left unsaid, that the reader can mull over if she so chooses.  While the vocabulary was very difficult for my primitive Italian, it was as beautifully written as Calvino's other work.<br />Warmly recommended.	2004-03-17

The author's approach - it was really a family enterprise based on the 250-year old letters his father found from a direct ancestor - is to paint a wide tableau of the era from the point of view of two young and doomed lovers.  Though this may sound melodramatic, it is the perfect vehicle for an incredible historic narrative, one of the best I ever read.<br /><br />Andrea Memmo is the scion of an ancient Venetian family, destined by blood and talent to become one of the most powerful politican-functionaries of a dying republic.  Memmo is steeped in the ideas that were \\"in the air\\" of the Enlightenment and reform, mentored by some of the most brillant men of the era, and friends with such colorful figures as Casanova and Denon, the later founder of the Louvre for Napoleon.  Also witty and handsome, he seemed destined for greatness from the youngest age.  Then he met Giustiniana, a semi-aristocrat whose mother was Greek and whose father was of \\"solid stock\\" from Britain, and Andrea's life took an unexpected turn involving passion, secrecy, and impossible hopes; she was one of the great beauties in the British expatriot circles.  However, by tradition that extends to the Venetian bureaucracy, Memmo must marry a \\"correctly\\" aristocratic woman by family arrangement.<br /><br />The author does a brilliant job of placing these two in the context of the times.  As the reader, you sympathise with the concerns of all the protagonists, from Andrea's familial obligations to Giustiniana's difficult mother who wants to avoid unneceassy prying into her murky past.  These are not two-dimensional characters, but full-bodied people trying desperately to control their destinies while falling prey to their weaknesses and vanities.  The vagaries of many intersecting careers of the protagonists and their friends are examined with perfect detail and brevity, an additional window into the life of the times and an exquisite treat.  From Venice, the reader is taken on a tour of the major European powers of the time, following Giustiniana and her family as they try to make their way in the decaying world of the old regime and unable to find a suitable place for themselves.<br /><br />While Memmo more or less fulfills his destiny, it is Giustiniana who emerges as the most original person in the book.  Her desires and career, from searching for a rich aristocrat to marry to her later success as a pioneering writer, are as facinating as they are reflections of what a troublesome person she must have been, always stepping into a hornets' nest of conventional expectations but somehow emerging admired and the nucleus of a salon that she built through friendship and talent.<br /><br />There is not a single boring page in this book, and it is written with a subtle elegance that covers what is happening in the 7-years' war to the rumblings of the French Revolution and the demise of the Venetian Republic, of which Memmo might have become the last Doge.  It all adds up to a masterpiece and is based on the personal correspondence of the lovers that were assembled from many different sources.<br /><br />I read this in Italian, which was very difficult as there are long sections from the letters in the Venetian patois of the time.  But the clarity of the writing is truly luminous.  I only hope that the writer will produce more.  He is truly first rate.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.onal window into the life of the times and an exquisite treat.

This book covers the basic basics of American history, both in fact and with some interpretation.  While I tire of the ga-ga patriotism on every page - the author repeatedly says that US history is the most interesting ever, that the country is the most accomplished, etc., etc. - it is constantly stimulating for us and a source of discussion in my household.<br />Oddly, the book does not indicate what level of reading it was written for.  I wanted to find something comprehensive and solid yet entertaining, which was NOT to be found in the children's section so I had to go to the adult history section.  It was for my daughter, who is in third grade in Europe, and who needs to learn some American history because we are moving to the US. It is truly ideal for that. However, I believe that it is far much more advanced readers, prehaps middle school.  Also, though written in 2001, it was not updated for 9/11 in spite of some coverage of terrorism.  It has been nice to see that my daughter is skeptical of the incessant claims of American exceptionalism, which comes out in our discussions of the book.<br />Recommended, though it verges on jingoism and blind patriotism that in the end appears parochial to me.	2004-02-20

Often, you can get something that works well, but is ugly; conversely, you can get something that looks great but doesn't really work.  The great service of this book is that Prof. Norman creates a useful framework to categorise and analyse these things. It is thoughtful, often funny, and in my experience covers the field accurately and concisely.<br /><br />First, according to Norman, there is the behavioral level, that is, how the thing functions.  This is how many people, in particular Americans, approach the objects that they buy:  if it works and is durable yet not expensive, it is a good deal.  Second, there is the visceral level, which is the (perhaps innate and genetically programmed) reaction that a buyer had to the appearence of something bought.  It is about beauty, the appearence of safety, and the like.  Third, there is the reflective level, which includes the personal associations of the consumer as well as the intended subtexts that a designer might attempt to incorporate.  THe latter two are more favored by the design-loving cultural elites in continental Europe, and they are prepared to pay a lot for them as well as discard still-usable goods for the latest fashion.  It is an entirely different mentality and linked to personal pleasure and a sense of emotional satisfaction that come from these objects, which blur the line of design and art.<br /><br />While all products reflect these three levels, more often than not one is favored by any given firm in the product design process.  Target goes for level one with its cheap and useful products, but with Graves' and Starck's designer goods is attempting to appraoch the other levels.  With its ironic and - let's admit it - obscure products of the Droog design Collective, the reflective level is favored; for example, its very ugly &#34;dresser&#34; (actually separate drawers lashed together with heavy straps by the consumer) is supposed to remind us of moving and even nomadic life.  While I enjoy the idea of these Droog subtexts, I would never want to have one in my house. In contrast, Alessi combines beauty and reflection in some of the best household objects currently manufactured, but they don't always work well; for example, the Starck lemon juicer is beautiful and evokes almost a haunting feeling in some, but you can't really juice lemons with it; or take the (functionally more successful) Mami pots series:  they are gently curved, evoking the clay pots of the Italian grandmother's hearth (or even a breast) and yet are simply beautiful.  You can't do much better than this in terms of quick analysis with a clear framework.  There are also some flashes of humor in the book, which helps it to move along.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there are many long sections where Norman goes off on tangents that I found uninteresting.  Sure, he speculates on innumerable product design possibilities, which may or may not interest (many of them felt like filler to me).  But what really bored me was the academic tone of the book, which skims along psych research and in particular cognitive psych.  While is makes it more academic, in my opinion it addes nothing to the design insights in the book, which was why I for one bought it.<br /><br />Many of the reviewers here were hard on Norman for his last two chapters on robotics and artificial intelligence in computers.  These are not my field, but I think that his choice to include them is legitimate in that both areas will certainly become a frontier of design in the near future.  I got some useful opinions out of it in that I thought about how frustrating computers are and how they could be better.<br /><br />Recommended with these caveats in mind.

There, he finds a hilarious panoplie of characters, from lice-infested peasant marxists to the hyper-intellectual young co-leader.  Each person is rendered so vividly - and if you have ever lived in Italy you recognise the types - that the novel is extremely dense and pleasureful.<br />The plot is fairly simple:  a young boy from a chaotic household has to flee after being arrested for stealing a pistol from his sister's German \\"client.\\"  (He was trying to impress the ineffectual drunks in his usual hangout, a smoky and dilapidated bar, and then gets caught up in the resistance.)  All the time, he is lonely and desperately seeking a special companion, someone to love and take care of him.  It is not a heroic tale, but one about what it was really like in the resistance:  more about the pauses and boredom, the bad food and promiscuity, the strange thoughts by men risking their lives for murky as well as clear-cut causes - the socialist revolution or to rid their countryside of the Germans who steal their cows.  This is a new and fascinating view, told with great wit and style.  This is the first novel I read in Italian, and its vocabulary is difficult but wonderfully succinct and clear.<br />Warmly recommended.	2004-02-11

Only the last was a true industrialist, while the first two were inventors who more or less failed to capture the full value of what they created.  The field of battle was was between direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC).  Jonnes also attempts to evoke the era - one of huge transition, both technological and social/organizational - in which they lived.<br /><br />The best things about this book are in overview and context.  I learned about the business environment and practices during the Gilded era, which was indeed extremely interesting and useful for my current project.  This is well researched and clearly written.  Moreover, what each of these individuals faced - their frustrations, ambitions, motivations, and methods - are also examined in some detail.  While I know a lot about Edison from previous research, this was a gold mine of info on his principal competitors, Westinghouse and Tesla, whose technology (AC) won the battle to become the standard of wire-furnsihed electric power.  Edison was an incredible inventor, but his obstinancy for sticking to what he created led him to bypass AC for the less workable DC (this is a pattern that led him to many strategic mistakes thru his career).  Tesla was an eccentric visionary and loner, who made great discoveries early on only to get mired into megalomanaical schemes during the last decades of his life.  Westinghouse was a true &#34;broker of innovation&#34; - finding and using talent with great efficiacy - and in many ways a brilliant pioneer of corporate and industrial organization; he was also a decent man with populist ideals in a time of ruthless exploitation and manipulation.<br /><br />However, this book failed for me on many counts.  First, it did not go into enough technological detail for me - I still don't understand the difference between AC and DC from a scientific point of view.  Second, I did not get much of a feeling for a story (billed on the cover as a titanic struggle) that was unfolding:  instead, the book jumped around and got bogged down in certian details, such as the grizzly chapter on Edison's promotion of an AC-current electric chair (to scare the public) or the maneuvering that preceeded the COlumbian Exposition.<br />Third, and this is a very personal perception, I did not like the way that Jonnes writes.  While her book certainly was not as dry or lifeless as so many academic studies tend to be, I felt she was straining to write as eloquently as McCullough or Schama, which I believe is beyond her talent.  This criticism may come from writing 101, but she uses too many adjectives.  Waves of panic are &#34;ungulating,&#34; electicity is &#34;ethereal,&#34; etc., each time failing to find &#34;le mot juste.&#34;  I really don't mean to be a snob about this - she is a better historian than I ever could be - but her writing style irritated me several times on every page.<br /><br />Recommended with these caveats in mind.much of a feeling for a story (billed on the cover as a titanic struggle) that was unfolding:  instead, the book jumped around and got bogged down in certian details, such as the grizzly chapter on Edison's promotion of an AC-current electric chair (to scare the public) or the maneuvering that preceeded the COlumbian Exposition.

One or two like this are OK, but when you read them day in and day out like I have to, the formula wears very very thin indeed.<br />I was looking for information on Thomas Edison, in particular how he built teams and what his leadership style was.  While there are some useful nuggets of information in this book, I was very disappointed at how little about Edison there was to find and how much about what McCormick calls post-corporate America (i.e. the old \\"new economy\\") and other rather banal ideas.  Moreover, absolutely nothing that the author says is footnoted or documented in any way, so the reader never knows what he is basing his conclusions or assertions on.  That is not second rate - it is third rate scholarship and unacceptable from any academic yardstick.  Finally, the farther you get into the book, the less there is about Edison and the more off-hand advice and even simple (very conservative) economic ideology there is.  I have seen similar ideas many times before and was not interested in hearing them reiterated in what I consider a less clearly written style and a less cogent manner.  FInally, the examples that he trots out are already badly dated:  Enron, for example, is touted as a superior post-corporate company because of the way it manages \\"creative\\" employees (I don't think he meant accounting); so is Sun Microsystems and many other info-econ companies that have seen near-catastrophic declines since the publication date of 2001 - it is so superficial that you have to wonder if there was any real thought behind any of it beyond the usual business-school shlock!  As such, this is conventional wisdom from BEFORE the stock market bubble burst.<br />Not recommended if you are a serious reader of biz lit or economics.  There are far, far better sources on Edison that are more clearly written and whose scholarship is impeccable, such as Israel's masterful book (Edison A Life of Invention).  The material on the new economy is so outdated - hense so appallingly misguided - that it is almost embarassing, and this is only two years after publication.better sources on Edison that are more clearly written and whose scholarship is impeccable, such as Israel's masterful book (Edison A Life of Invention).

Jehl is totally admiring of the man, indeed loves him as a father and remains as awestruck as the day he met &quot;the inventor of the phonograph.&quot;<br />At its best, the book makes the period come alive with personal details of Edison's greatest achievements and a sense of how he did what he did.  (It was largely through outstanding teams, an uncanny sense of intuition in technological questions, and harder work than anyone dared imagine.)  In addition, the reader gets to know the characters who worked in the Menlo Park facility, which was the prototype of all modern industrial research labs and phenomenally productive. You get technical details as well, which underline the achievements in all their complexity and audacity.<br />However, there is no doubt that this is an authorised version:  Jehl wrote it as a living exhibit in the reconstructed Menlo lab that Henry Ford financed.  As such, it is totally fawning over Edison and glosses over or entirely ignores anything unpleasant about him, which severely restricts its accuracy and usefulness to the casual reader.  FOr a blanced view, the reader must seek the excellent bios that regularly appear.<br />This book is for scholars - a must as all the bios I know are based in large part on it - but also for history buffs and Edison lovers.  (I read it for a writing project and found many details that I will use.)  It is also splendidly written.  Warmly recommended with these caveats in mind.	2004-01-28

It is extremely interesting as a showcase for his thoughtfulness and what goes into the design process at Philips, from electronic minaturization and city lighting to ethical concerns about the environment and even the concerns of developing countries and their (unprofitable) needs.  I was truly rivetted by much of it, and saw certain areas of design I knew in new ways while learning about others.  The Second volume, FACTS, consists largely of beautiful photos of his group's products.  At the very least, I will consider Philips products first now, as I know some of what is behind them.<br />I would recommend this book to any design student:  Philips is not just about profit, but about much much more.  Marzano really gets you to think about both how and why products are designed the way that they are and, by extension, we can imagine the type of society and culture that we want in the future.  It is a tour de force.  As thought, this is truly outstanding and stimulates the appetite for further inquiry - just what a student needs.<br />That being said, there are many things that the book is not, about which potential readers should know.  Marzano does not go into how his design group fits into Philips - as I understand it, it is autonomous from the business units and must sell its ideas to them and I suspect that lots of his ideas get lost in the brutal translation to profit-seeking manufactures.  Morover, Marzano evokes rather than systematially develops or analyses his concepts; this is not necessarily a criticism, but the reader will have to seek them elsewhere for more consistent treatment.  Finally, Marzano also gets into the public policy arena - arguing that designers should try to communicate their progressive ideas to politicians - which I found a worthy thought but rather vague and even naive on his part.<br />Warmly recommended.	2004-01-10

Overall, I must say that it was an absolutely excellent holiday book as well as chock full of useful ideas for my scholarly purposes.  This is an extremely difficult balance to strike and Israel has done it better than I thought possible - I was prepared for a long dry slog and instead found a great and exciting story.<br />Edison, Israel argues, was not just a lone little-educated tinkerer of genius as he is often portrayed, but the creator of the prototype for the modern corporate research lab - he knew how to find talent, how to organize it to get the most out of people, and how to beat the competition by both speed and in the creation of entire new systems of technology. He also knew how to manipulate the media and build on his fame, creating a myth to which he had to live up. That being said, he had a pitch-perfect intuitive sense not only of potential new markets, but of how to create technical solutions to exploit them.  He learned from his failures and strove to apply his less-successful inventions elsewhere, often to great effect.  Taken together, this was true business genius and Israel explains it all succinctly, including the exposure of Edison's many weaknesses in management and his financial affairs and his many flops (such as the mining experiments that nearly bankrupted him).  Furthermore, the basics of his major inventions - improvements to the telegraph and telephone, the light bulb, commerical electricity generation systems, to mention a few - are covered with competence, always with an eye to the management of it all and what it took, all of which are of great use.  This adds up to a masterpiece of scholarship and popular writing in my view, crossing a plethora of disciplines in very readable prose and at a good pace of storytelling.<br /><br />However, there are many things that make this a challenging read and in some ways disappointing.  Even though I know a lot about science and engineering from my own writing, I found the many passages explaining the nuts and bolts of his inventions hard to follow and ultimately rather dry.  If the reader is not interested in these highly technical details, he can skim them without losing the narrative thread.  Moreover, Edison as a person does not always come thru, though really he was his work and not much else.  You also do not learn much about the fate of his enterprises or even his personal financial fortune after his death, which is also a part of his legacy that should be explored.  Finally, Israel addresses somewhat rarified questions in the concluding chapter regarding whether Edison was a &#34;scientist&#34; and how industrial research was changing (developing specialties that required far more education than inventors of Edison's &#34;heroic invention&#34; epoch) to make the emergence of generalist, self-taught inventors like him far more difficult and with limited horizons; while I enjoyed this a great deal, it is of limited interest to those who were never steeped in &#34;science policy.&#34;<br /><br />All in all, highest recommendation.

Schama, in my reading, wanted to cover the whole of a unique humanist culture - tolerant, intelligent, united by outside threats and not so much by Calvinism, and loosely structured in the era of absolutism.  Focusing largely on paintings, prints, and writings, Schama offers a dazzling tour - the only trouble is, he seems to want to cover everything, and in the process the thread of narrative is lost from the very beginning in all the luscious details.  While it is far better than Landscape and Memory in terms of unity of theme, there are long passages where it is near-impossilbe to tell where schama wants to go or what he really has to say.<br /><br />At its best, the book offers lovely descriptions of such varied subjects as midwives, a brief fascination with beached whales, sex, diet, and charity, to name just a few.  Many of the details along the way that need explanation are very briefly referred to, such as the 80-year War of independence from Spain, the difficulties with France as Louis XIV sought to expand his national territory, and the fabulous technological achievement of reclaiming much of the land from sea silt.  The reader is treated to a grand political experiment along with the art.  WHen I next go there, my experience will be immeasurably enriched.<br /><br />However, at its worst, Schama appeared to me to be showing off his erudition, which is truly incredible and hence describing way way too much while not covering more of the basics.  While this certainly points to the weaknesses of my own education in history, I doubt that many readers would know the mechanisms of Dutch economic superiority or why the Tulip mania could occur there and not in Antwerp or Venice.  Instead, for example, Schama devotes over 30 pages to describing how much they ate, drank, and smoked referring innumerable obscure artists and interpreting all of the details of composition and subject matter in individual works.  Yes, the prose is luminous, but why so awfully much??!  It is really more of a multi-layered essay that will have to be re-read, if the reader has time and the will to invest in it.<br />Moreover, the end of the book is rushed and becomes less and less coherent at the moment when the reader is hoping that it will somehow get all tied together with an overview.  The references in the last 100 pages become more obscure and recondite, requiring ever greater knowledge on the part of the reader as explanations disappear.  And the epilogue did absolutely nothing for me and was for the most part incomprehensible.<br /><br />Recommended with these caveats in mind.  It is not for beginners!

His characters (and his analyses) brim with the most total alienation imaginable, with the strong dose of narcissism that comes along with slef-declared geniuses.  The protagonist of this novel is a bored scholar, researching an ancestor.  He is incapable of love and in the grips of a depression and loathing that fill him with waves of nausea.  That is it in this novel!  There is meaning in nothing. The only thing I felt reading about these sick people was nausea - and boredom.<br />In writing a negative review of such a famous novel, I know there will be lots who disagree, but I am sick of novels like this that are held up by a national cultural establishment as \\"great,\\" i.e. enhancing their international image, rather than works that should be read more openly and naively.  You can tell the difference in so many media:  look at Michelangelo and you immediately feel his genius, whereas if you fail to perceive the artistic \\"value\\" of many contemporary works, you are condemned as lacking the finesse and brains to see what you are told to see.<br />Not recommended.  This is the ideal novel for a high school student to read ostentatiously, exhibiting some kind of \\"depth.\\"	2003-12-10

Murakami does that for me with Japan, where I lived for 2 years.  He portrays that strange country as utterly lacking in inspiration, brutally crushing to any spirit of individuality, and full of cruel and meaningless obligations imposed from above.  It is, in my view, unerringly accurate and perceptive, while deeply sad as I knew many people like those here but who would never be capable of articulating their ennui.  These stories perfectly blend mundane detail with horrific violence and nihilism, in a mother who decides she longer needs to sleep to a man who has quit his job as a legal clerk walking in his backyard.  The reality behind these characters and scenes - so black and yet so apparently normal - are believable to anyone who has lived and worked in Japan, though certainly not to tourists or other casual observers.  As such, I believe that Murakami has done for modern Japan what Balzac and Zola did for 19th C France:  the quality is that high, as is the irony and humor that permeates his work.  I loved it, but it takes a strong stomach.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-09

It involves corruption, intimidation (legal, employment/career, and physical), and simple standard operating procedure that allows the elite to (apparently literally) get away with murder.  The authors refer to &#34;the chokers&#34; (les etouffeurs) who maintain this apparatus that pays them off, employs them, and keeps them in power without too many irritating questions.  It is indeed an extremely bleak assessment of modern France as in thrall to an interlocking &#34;nomenclatura&#34; of polticians, bureaucrats, and the press.  Anyone who talks is intimidated and crushed - in most cases.<br /><br />For example, in the mid-1980s, when it became apparent that blood provided to hemophiliacs (to enhance their blood clotting factor) was tainted with the AIDS virus, it was known that the bureaucrat in charge was in cahoots with the blood companies.  Together, they had refused to use an available technology to superheat the blood, thereby destroying the virus, for business reasons and simple laziness.  The top journalist - of Le Monde - was directly in the pay of this group (for PR services) as a supplement to his income, apparently a standard practice among French journalists that is akin to the &#34;speaking engagements&#34; that some American mega-journalists do.  The legal apparatus was afraid to touch the issue, and meanwhile thousands more were inflected via transfusions.  Finally, some people spoke and it became one of the biggest scandals of post-war France.  This is a truely shocking and horrible story.<br /><br />Similar stories can be told about Mitterrand's secret second family (housed at taxpayer expense in a chateau), Giscard's diamonds (from the cannabalistic dictator Bokassa), a long-ignored though well known ring of sex abusers of chidren in Provence, and payoff scandals like that of the recent Elf trial.  Of course, what the reader wonders is what stories don't get told and what impact it all has on the political process.  It is a very ugly picture.<br /><br />If you are not quite sure what events the above paragraph refers to, you are forewarned about the knowledge level required for this book.  Hundreds of recent events are referred to with little explanation - I was educated at one of the top political science schools in Paris and not even I was certain what such phrases as the &#34;Balladurian debacle&#34; should evoke.  In the same way, names of media and political personalities are reeled off in such rapid succession that it made my head spin.  Thus, you must have read the French press regularly over the last 30 years or so.  That limits the audience, to say the least, but it is very very interesting indeed.  I gained a completely different perspective on a country I know very well (and love and hate), including how the institutions work and how people manage their careers, often those of individuals that I watched on TV and whose books I read.<br /><br />That being said, there is a relentless quality about the outrage in this book that is tiring.  It is 500 pages of denunciation, laments, and righteous anger.  It reads much like a book by Seymour Hersh, which is akin to whipping a subject so hard and long that it is reduced to sludge.  Moreover, the title &#34;Omerta&#34; refers to the behavior of the mafia in S Italy, which keeps people silent through both kinship loyalty and naked fear - people can get shot in broad daylight and no one will talk.  I think this overdoes it a bit, but that is a subjective judgment.<br /><br />Recommended warmly for specialists in and lovers of France.

Late in a successful life with a happy family, Styron was afflicted with a serious depression and nearly killed himself.  He describes it with such anxious clarity that it is almost unbearable to read if you or someone close to you has suffered like this.  He recovers, of course.<br />What is lacking in his story is a clear understanding of what it may have meant - why he became so depressed at that time in his life.  Instead, it is viewed more as an illness that attacked him from the outside, though he does acknowledge some personal issues obliquely.  And a large part of his cure is finding the right kind of medication, with talking therapy as an adjunct.  This was disappointing to me, as I think that there must have been issues that meant something throughout his life and in the immediate circumstances that set it off.  Instead, it appears we are to believe it is more genetic than environmental.  Perhaps it is, but I would have preferrred more introspection and as such felt this was superficial.  However, this is my bias.<br />Recommended as a starting point.	2003-11-26

The talent of these writers, in my opinion as a writer, is better than that of any other travel writers I know, indeed better than many journalists.

It is hard because most of them were micro-economists who lived in a world of utility functions, game theory, and loops of mathematical logic - just the kind of stuff that puts many off (like me) of &quot;public policy&quot; as an academic field that is dominated by economists who are little more than self-important if intelligent twits - with no practical wisdom whatsoever.<br />However, this group was important because they were trying to encapsulate nuclear weapons into their rationalist methodologies.  Kaplan's book is the ideal companion to Freeman's Evolution of Nuclear Strategy, which is so dry by comparison and yet covers the strategy better.  It is a fun read, though a bit overwhelming to get through as there were SO MANY of them.  (There was an added interest for me, as I knew some of these characters as a student and was unimpressed with them as thinkers while respecting their impact on public policy.)<br />Whoever thought that microeconomists following their threads of logic could have had such an enormous influence on military strategy.  I never would have!  If I understood it, what they did was link military considerations into a mathematical methodology that could be studied and discussed and that offered conclusions - or predictions - if (tortuously) followed to their end.  This helped military planers get a handle on these issues and (perhaps) to think more clearly.<br />Much of quality of this book is due to the fact that Kaplan is a really good reporter and not an academic who is just shuffling papers.  He got out and talked to a lot of these guys, though none of them appear as particularly sympathetic characters to me.  Amazingly, he used this book as his PhD disseration at MIT in poli-sci.  You gotta respect him as a writer.<br />Recommended as a colorful view of some weird thinkers who had enormous influence on our lives.w of some weird thinkers who had enormous influence on our lives.	2003-11-22

Forgive my naivete, but it also exemplifies why academia is viewed by so many as a boring world of, well, extreme experts of recondite trivia - even when it deals with the potential destruction of industrial civilization.  In my view, this book utterly fails to cross over to the interested non-specialist or those who are not writing a dissertation but just want a good read.  I never would have cracked this if it wasn't for work.<br />That being said, the book summarises an absoulutely enormous amount of scholarship and the thinking of the mysterious &quot;wizards&quot; who argued in little offices in the Pentagon for this type of bomb, that type of missile or artillery shell, and this type of treaty.  Fortunately, a lot of this is now more history with the end of the Cold War and the arms race, but it still appears like a bizarre parallel universe of microeconomics applied to massiave destructive capabilites with a cold rationality and words like &quot;deterrence&quot; and &quot;mutual assured destruction.&quot;  Alas, very little of the political context or the human drama is covered in its quirky detail, so don't seek that here.  The prose is clear, if a bit like a massive vanilla milkshake when you read it in one sitting (as I had to).  I learned from this, but simply did not enjoy it past the first chapter or even the introduction.  The achievement is inarguable, but this book is like a tough home work assignment in undergraduate school.<br />Recommended for academic purposes, but not for the interested layman.	2003-11-22

Though it is very difficult to get into - in the original v1 there is a long abstract section on gulags as a sewage system in turbid prose - once the reader gets swept into thos narrative of suffering there is no other reading experience like it.<br />Solzhenitsyn spent his youth as a gulag prisoner for having criticized Stalin on a postcard.  V1 covers his arrest and interrogation and transport into despair and disillusionment.  What he experienced, from his start as a strong and idealistic young war leader, can only be described as hell on earth.  Only Hitler's death factories could compare, and yet Stalin's slave labor camps were being held up as marvels of social policy and redemption.  The cruelty of treatment, the insights into the astonishing characters around him, and the compilation of other people's stories - Solzhenitsyn describes his experience as only one gulp from an ocean of bitterness and shattered lives - are unequalled in the modern literature on totalitarianism.  My experience was to be utterly transported into this realm, to look at my life and values and think about what mattered most to develop within myself.  No other book ever had a deeper impact on me.  That makes this, in my opinion, essential reading to understand the last century at its very very worst.<br />The second volume follows Solzhenitsyn as he becomes a hardened and grief-stricken prison slave, indifferent to whether he is killed by a stray bullet during riots and abandoning his faith in communism.  A central pert of the book is his religious conversion - the only one I ever read about that I truly understood on an emotional level - at the deathbed of perhaps his greatest freind.  V3 covers his relesase from prison and his attempts to rebuild his life.<br />All three volumes offered to me the experience of living totally outside of myself and in the reality of a totalitarian state.  I first read these in EUrope when they appeared, and the debates on the merits of the communist sytem were very much alive at the time.  Now they are only of historical interest, but I still think they are must reading for anyone who wants to understand the worst of one of the most tumultuous centuries in the history of mankind.<br />Highest recommendation.he reality of a totalitarian state.

When I like a book by the Nab, I absolutely love it as masterpiece of quirkiness and bizarre obsessions, if always devoid of much normal human emotion.  This book is truly different from anything else I know if his:  the character is cold and calculating, quite uninteresting and lacking in charm and learning.  Bored with his life and hating everyone in it, he is planing the &quot;perfect crime&quot; to liberate himself.  While there are games within games - just how perfect is the crime? - this horrible guy simply appeared horrible and boring to me, and I never really enjoyed his stream of thoughts and plans.

And the inside is similarly grotesque, with a series of ape and pig embryos preserved in formaldahyde stare out or grin at us, images of urban apocalypse in response to 9/11, etc etc.  I do not like the images and do not get what these young artists are trying to do, without forgetting to mention what movement they might represent, if any.<br />Fabrica is a wonderful place near Treviso Italy, which Benetton has set up as a talent forge - everyone who gets a position there must be under 25, so the place buzzes with youthful energy and iconoclasm - from which the company can draw but more for generating experiments in multi-media.  So it is very interesting for me to see as a business writer - a company has the elan to sponsor this kind of thing.

First, its words are as important as its images - there are real substantive ideas that are well expressed and not just adjuncts to nice photos, which in my opinion is the disease of many design \\"books.\\"  Second, it is a critique of both modernist and post-modernist design movements.  THird, it offers a manifesto for a new consumer-oriented movement that is unlike any other that I am aware of.<br />Droog is an informal grouping that started out Dutch and has expanded to include some of the best young designers in the world.  The movement it represents and propels is a rebellion against the overly ornate and scultped perfection that past industrial and architectural design saw as an ideal. Instead, Droog designers are out to entirely re-make the design process:  rather than aesthetic taste (or abstract functionalist ideals), their approach is more conceptual, poking fun at overly serious or bourgeois design, while critiquing modern society and staying ecologically aware.  From \\"Less is More\\" to \\"Less is a Bore,\\" Droog wants to say \\"Less and More.\\"  This certainly would appear difficult to comprehend, but this book lays it out very clearly for anyone who knows the history of design and the various movements.<br />To accomplish their vision, Droog designers take old objects and re-cycle them by giving them new meaning; purposefully introduce flaws, uncertainty, and direct consumer participation into the design process; and employ both old and new technologies in novel ways.  All the while, there is an undertone of irony and chance at what they do, with many objects turning out unique and unreproducible in larer scale production.  To sum up, Droog has created a kind of conceptual art for consumers, much like Duchamp and the Dadaists did for modern art, taking the observers' interest away from the appearence of the object in favor of an idea behind it.<br />Time will tell how well they succeed.  Apparently, Droog does turn a modest profit.  The kind of things they produce are chairs woven entirely out of high tech fiber and dipped in expoxy to keep their form, a \\"dresser\\" of old drawers that the purchaser must band together by a movers' strap rope (adding anything else they may desire to it), and a bundle of ordinary lightbulbs forming a chandelier that resembles a bouquet of flowers.  This results not in traditional beauty, but highly provocative and thoughtful products. For myself, I am uncertain if I like - or would want to own - what they turn out, but their vision and methods are fascinating and at present one of the greatest influences in the design world.

For myself, I am uncertain if I like - or would want to own - what they turn out, but their vision and methods are fascinating and at present one of the greatest influences in the design world.  So for design lovers and professionals, this book is a must have.<br />Recommended warmly - for the interested.	2003-11-04

Throughout, the approach is eclectic and ranges over an unusually wide range of subjects, including anthropology and psychology, history, technical engineering, and political science.<br /><br />In a nutshell that oversimplifies, Scully argues that before the Greeks (and in the Americas to today), architecture emphasized man's links to the earth, reflecting natural forms and consciously forming a part of a landscape/environment larger and more powerful than themselves.  The Greeks, with their temples and the anthropomorphic sculpture that were an integral part of them, glorified the view of man as a actor of accomplishment and greater power, though still in thrall to nature.  THe Romans refined this vision, but with Christianity began to build temples that were walls against the encroaching world and the barbarian chaos that was approaching.  THen, with the Gothic era, the power of kings was brought to the fore, which continued in the French gardens of the (Baroque) absolutism period and symbolised the belief that nature could be controlled by strong central authority.  Meanwhile, the Renaissance architects and in particular Palladio re-introduced the individual as an actor within (and aesthetically designed to fit into) an urban context, leading directly to the development of private homes and eventually suburbia.  Later, the internationalist/modernists broke these moulds, producing huge buildings that fit neither the landscape nor the human context in which they were built, e.g. the faceless skyscrapers that destroy neighborhoods and disregard their impact on others.  This, in Scully's view was hubris that was dangerous and ugly. Finally, Scully concludes that there are signs of a movement back to nature that will incorporate many of these ideals.<br /><br />The level at which this book is written is quite high, perhaps at the graduate level.  I believe that to truly appreciate the book, the reader must know - or independently acquire while reading it - a great deal of historical knowledge, including the history of architecture.  That makes much of the book hard going, and there were sections that lost me.  I did not always agree with his interpretations, but they were always stimulating as a new way to view things.<br /><br />While there are too many holes in my own knowledge to judge what Scully has done here in any scholarly way, the book is a truly vast synthesis of knowledge, a life's work of interpretation and visits to great monuments all over the world.  Personally, as I live in Europe, it was a fantastic pleasure as I have visited many of the scenes he chose (Lindos, Versailles, Bomarzo, for example) and wondered about many of the issues Scully discusses - hence, his essays solved many mysteries for me while making me hungry to learn much much more.  Architecture will never appear the same to me again:  I now have gained a wonderful reference point from which to depart and it was this book that gave it to me.<br /><br />Finally, Scully's writing style is truly superb.  His book is not at all pedantic, but exudes a love for his life's work that I found charming and modest.  He must have been a great teacher.  Nonetheless, the quality of many of the photos left much to be desired.<br />Warmly recommended, but expect to work to get through this.at there are signs of a movement back to nature that will incorporate many of these ideals.

Not only does it evoke a sense of mystery in life and the sacred in late antiquity, but it turns an utterly bizarre plot into something totally believable.  The result is a profound and inspiring meditation on life.  I felt wonder, repulsion, and a desire to learn more - there is nothing more that a reader could hope for in an historical novel.<br />The plot revolves around a banished sybil, who has lived in seclusion for so many years with her retarded son that she has become a legend in the towns nearby.  An ordinary man condemned to immortality seeks her out, and they recount to eachother their life stories.  The reader feels what it was like to live then, how religious beliefs shaped their lives and world view, and how in that seminal era the gods may indeed have erred.  I was totally awestruck at the way that it made me feel.<br />Highest recommendation.	2003-10-17

At the same time, those who convince themselves that they appreciate it in the correct way can lord it over the rest of us naifs.<br />After having heard about this book for years from a dear Stein-devotee pal, I gave it a try.  I must say that, not only was I disappointed in the so-called language experimentation, but I was just plain bored.  I did not find the characters interesting; I did not get taken into their world view by the stream-of-consciousness writing style that is Stein's trademark; I did not feel like I learned anything.  What truly convinced my pal that I am an artistic philistine - and I guess I am in her measure - is that I vastly preferred The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas, which was written for a popular audience (this is, clearly written and not with all the obscure and in my view idioitic word play).<br />Oh well, this review will no doubt get many \\"unhelpful\\" votes, but then, at least I looked at it honestly and and naively and gave it the effort an avant-garde classic deserves.  NOT RECOMMENDED.	2003-10-13

Over 500 pages, you witness the aspirations and grotesque decline of a working-class family into alcoholism, promiscuity, and violence.  It is so awful, the blows so continual and harsh, that only the most committed of readers will be able to get through it.  But for those that do, I believe there are great rewards.<br />On many levels, this book broke new ground.  First, it is a clinical dissection of the progression of alcoholism, based on direct observation by Zola and scientific research, describing not only its symptoms in gory detail, but its impact on a family.  Second, it was one of the first attempts to portray the working class realistically, rather than as a sterotype of inferior crudity or romanticised as noble savages.  THis spawned an entire genre of socially relevant novels and is a great contribution.  Third, it introduced an entirely new vocabulary into French art, that is, the gutter argot that the Academie Francaise condemned as unsuitable.  Taken together, these are remarkable acheivements.<br />While I hesitate to reveal the plot, I assume that most readers will know it in outline.  It involves a good person - a hard-working laundress with dreams of running her own shop - who marries a neighbor a few weeks after her lover leaves her with two children in Paris. For many years, things go well:  they love eachother, work very hard and save money, and live cleanly.  THen, after a terrible accident, the husband begins to drink, which initiates a downward spiral that is so painful to follow:  his work suffers, then his marriage, and finally his health.  The laundress, who is so sympathetic and full of hopes, is simply crushed under the burden of supporting everyone financially and emotionally.  SHe wants to do what is right and fails utterly, helpless to halt the destruction she is witnessing.  In addition, her many enemies, such as her spiteful in-laws and neighborhood gossips, add cruel twists to her decline.<br />The heroine's misery and debasement are monuments to naturalist realism, through which Zola aspired to show things as they really are:  there is none of the growth and romantic redemption that one expects in Anglo-saxon novels from the same period of the late 19C.  On a broader longitudinal scheme, the novel also shows the backgrounds of two of Zola's most important characters, the half-siblings Nana and Etienne, who are the central characters in two truly great novels that follow (Nana and Germinal).  FInally, it adds a crucial dimension to the portrait of 2nd-Empire France, that of the working class.<br />Recommended as a truly historic novel.  However, the reader is warned that there is little pleasure in store.d neighborhood gossips, add cruel twists to her decline.<br />The heroine's misery and debasement are monuments to naturalist realism, through which Zola aspired to show things as they really are:  there is none of the growth and romantic redemption that one expects in Anglo-saxon novels from the same period of the late 19C.

Well, it was just as good as when I was in high school, perhaps even better now that I know history better.  This book opened an entire world to me of historical novels and stuck so vividly in my mind that it has been a basic pole of comparison ever since.  The setting, of course, is in the waning days of Imperial Russia around a murder trial of a good man that is based purely on anti-semitism.  It is still one of the best - great personalities, vivid historical evocations, and extreme subtlty all rolled into one.  The artistry of this novel and its luminous prose ranks it up there with Yourcenar's finest works of historical fiction - the quality is that good.<br />Recommended for the parent hoping to introduce a child to the wonders of history as well as to the adult in search of a great learning experience.	2003-09-19

Starting with the dawn of civilization (in what is now Iraq), Glancey takes the reader on a tour of human history from the angle of what we build to worship, work, and live in.  THe basics are covered extremely well, providing a context for further research.<br />Glancey writes with grace and clarity, dividing each major movement into regular cuts of two pages, each with brilliant images.  While this format shoehorns things into categories that are a bit too sharply delineated, that kind of reductionism is a necessity in this kind of survey.  In the latter part of the book, some of the distinctions appear artificial, but then we are in a period where no dominating style - you get post-modern, decontructivist, and organic, etc. - has emerged and the author had to make some decisions regarding how to put them in the format.  To his credit, Glancey does not ignore the exceptions and quirks.<br />One thing I enjoyed about the book is that Glancey does not shy away from making strikingly loud judgements, many of which I did not share.  Corbusier, he writes, &quot;was the most inventive and poetic architect who ever lived.&quot;  Now that is strong stuff and I would never have expected it in a routine survey! (While I can respect and understand what Corbusier did, I don't love it like Glancey.)  But that is what makes this book more than a run of the mill overview - it adds flavor and stimulates.  Also, while international, because Glancey is a Brit, much of it focuses on Britain and contemporary Europe, which provides a valuable contrast to more US-centric views.<br />Recommended.	2003-09-08

It has some good stories that support the flow of ideas, of which there are very many.  THe way that it is written makes this a very difficult book to get through if you are looking for a straight read, which I was.  I did not enjoy reading it, but will go back to it when the right question arises.

Rather than a portrait of TJ that delved into how his personality influenced his political life and choices, this is purely about his psychological makeup. It has very little about the times and context he lived in, which left me quite bored.  Instead, the reader is treated to the debate on his relationship with the slave woman who bore him so many children, what impact the loss of his wife had on him, etc. Indeed, I was looking for something on the level of Young Man Luther by Eriksen, and this falls so short of that mark that it is awful by comparison.  As such, you have all of the flaws of psychohistory - that we can never really understand someone's psychological makeup who is long dead - and yet none of the advantages of Eriksen's approach, which did treat the historical context while being so splendidly evocative about life in general.  Brodie apparently just doesn't have that kind of depth.<br />Recommended only as a useful perspective for specialists who might benefit from this kind of speculative enterprise.  I do not believe that many general readers who want to know about TJ's life and times would enjoy this.	2003-09-04

As far as I can tell, Brookhiser has done no new research, questions nothing, and is content to assume Hamilton was a brilliant, competent, and good man who helped to forge the force for the good that America would become.  While I learned some interesting biographical details, I could have gotten them from any other biography.  Moreover, Brookhiser does not have a nice or very clear writing style - the tone of the book is rushed, somewhat repetitious, and boring.  It was easy to skim for facts and offered no original pleasures.  As such, I thought it was a real dud.<br />If these criticisms don't matter to you, then you might find this book satisfactory.

It is a great pleasure to read something by this disillusioned man that can surprise me:  I have read most of the novels in his American Cycle and (with the exception of his \\"Lincoln\\") was growing tired of his cynicism.  Well, I picked up this one - its theme is the corruption of the Gilded Age and its plot revolves around the stolen election of 1876 - and was delighted to learn that Gore Vidal genuinely cares about how the US democracy works/worked.  Moreover, this is a wonderful accomplishment by a novelist at the height of his powers, one of the best of the series.<br />The protagonists in the story are Charlie Schuyler, from \\"Burr\\", and his incomparable daughter as they wend their way into the New York and Washington \\"City\\" of the Gilded Age.  While blatant corruption is corroding the foundations of the Republic, Charlie is wined and dined by the politically indifferent rich as a celebrated political writer (on Europe) while he seeks to find a suitable mate for his recently widowed and now penniless daughter.  As a courtiers at the court of Napoleon III, they fit in brilliantly as Charlie attempts to find any writing work he can; the subtleties of the behavior of the ruling classes come across as both comic and sinister, but also realistic.  It is a brutal indictment of decadence at the Centennial of America that gets worse and worse as the machinations of stealing a presidential election are revealed.  Though it is from an observers eyes, which is consistent with the style of most of Vidal's series, political events take much more of the center stage and as such, there is a great deal of history to learn (of which I for one was largely ignorent).<br />As a novel, this is also great fun.  It is written in the form of a candid diary by Charlie, who is making notes for future books he is imagining as he observes unfolding events in real time.  The characters he comes in contact with are fabulously well drawn.  First, there is Samuel Tilden, one of the few truly decent men to appear in any of Vidal's work (and a loser, I note).  Then there is the apparently corrupt President Grant and his cronies who are indisputably corrupt along with all of the top politicians in DC.  And of course, there are the journalists (including a brilliant, hilarious, and yet sad cameo portrait of Mark Twain), some of whom are idealists and most of whom are simple opportunists.  Finally, there is the birth of the fictional Sanford clan that re-appears in Vidal's later novels.  An unexpected twist in the plot also reveals the weaknesses of Charlie as an observer, which adds a whole new dimension to the novel that shocks the reader into reassessing everything (s)he has read.

So long as you embrace the complexity and can live in another world, the full version is utterly rivetting to read.<br />Everyone knows the plot in outline.  A gifted and yet simple sailor, Dantes, is the victim of a conspiracy involving thwarted love, greed, and unbridled ambition. By eliminating him, three men get what they want and move brilliantly into the rapidly changing and corrupt French society.  They forget Dantes, who is isolated in despair in a notorious political dungeon, the Chateau d'If.  While in prison, he meets an Italian savant who tunnels into his room and who teaches him the entire pantheon of classical knowledge, which he memorised as a tutor to princes; he also harbors a secret about an immense treasure on the island of Monte Cristo.  Dantes escapes, finds the treasaure, and sets about creating an elaborate series of traps to wreak vengence on the three men who condemned him.  This occurs in about the 1st 250 pages of the book. At this point, after doing some good for a family that had tried to help him, Dantes' interior dialogue - so vivid as he figures out who betrayed him and learns to hate them while learning the love the Italian savant as a 2nd father - becomes silent to the reader.  What Dantes then does is insinuate himelf into French high society, creating relationships with the 3 men and their families with a cunning that can only be called genius.  This takes place over about 700 pages and is an indictment of the society that Dumas despised.  Though the Count is falling in love, his hatred is so implacable and cold as to render him an automaton of vengence.  Then, in the last 3rd of the book as the train of destruction he created is set in motion, Dantes is again reborn as a man who can feel and reflect on what he has done.  It is a moving apotheosis of redemption and regret.<br />What is so amazing about the story is that, as outlandish as some of the plot twists and coincidences are, the reader is (or at least I was) swept into a fast-moving narrative that is irresistably readable.  In doing so, Dumas helped to spawn an entirely new genre of novel:  the psychological thriller, or adventure that provokes reflection and awe. Its depth is beyond a simple swashbuckler.  Its world is complete in sumptuous and realistic detail while remaining too fantastic to believe.  Its characters are so complex and yet such romantic ideals as they evolve.  Moreover, there are also a number of symbols throughout the book, evoking Christian and pagan themes, so that the book can be interpreted on a number of levels.<br />This is one of the best novels I ever read and certainly Dumas' best.  Though it took me an entire summer to get through it, I will never forget it.  For those of you who read French, Dumas' language is stunningly clear and graceful, while using a vocabulary that is easily accessible.

Instead, it is a disjointed series of well researched stories and anecdotes - there is no attempt at analysis or to relate them to trends that contributed to the present state of America.  Absolutely none, when the stories beg for them and could have been analysed with a little more effort.<br />Moreover, I read the book on travel and while I enjoyed it on a long train ride, I remember virtually nothing now - that is a sure mark for me of the fact that this is more fluff than real historical writing.  This is one of my tests for meatiness:  if I remember a lot and feel like I need to learn much more, I feel the book is a success.  Well, this one fails on both counts.<br />Recommended as throwaway entertainment.  If you want real history, look elsewhere.	2003-08-05

You get a near-totally jaundiced view of our American mythology and sense of uniqueness, all from the point of view of our so-called greatest scoundrel since Benedict Arnold.  This perspective is so funny and enlightening that just that alone is enough to recommend the book.  (Vidal describes George Washington as having the &quot;hips and bosom&quot; of a woman, portraying his poor soldiering and yet brilliant engineering of his public image; Jefferson is a shifty though shrewd hypocrit and manipulator of genius; and Hamilton is a monarchist and proto-Napoleon.)<br />But this novel is even better than that kind of satire:  I studied its structure and characters in far greater detail this time around, and came to believe that the historical details obscure a truly masterful performance by a modern writer.  The narrative moves on two levels, including the present when a young writer begins to take down Burr's memoires and of course the past career of the charming and much vilified man.  In many ways, the characters are more multi-dimentional than in many of his other novels.  And this novel is also the start of a kind of longitudinal Balzacian literary experiment in which the reader sees characters and their descendants re-appear to make their mark over 150 years.  After all these years of being a fan, I realise that I have perhaps under-estimated Vidal as a writer!  I am now prepared to go back to the others in the series for a second read.  It is so rare to meet a contemporary American novelist whose work ages so well.<br />Warmly recommended.	2003-07-26

Feynman	Books	2	58	68	N	N	scraping the bottom of the feynmaniana barrel	This book is yet another posthumous compilation of Feynman's musings.  With each successive book - starting from the wonderful transcriptions of Leighton, Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman - they have been declining in quality for years.  Well, this is a hodgepodge of paper scraps and even raw oral interviews that have been thrown together to exploit just about the last drop of these kinds of things, and I can say that I don't think the process should continue.<br /><br />There are some amusing things in this book and some interesting details, but there really isn't anything special except for the fact that Feynman enjoys the personality cult associated with a zany physics genius.  He was an original character and, in physics, a truly great thinker.  But that doesn't make every last little thing that he ever said or scribbled down interesting, except to uncritical devotees who live with the fantasy that everything he said was better than worthwhile.  Indeed, if you know about something in great depth he writes (well talks) about, his views appear as superficial as the rest of non-specialists on the subjects.  Where he is truly interesting in on physics, mathematics, and science - and the overwhelming majority of what he produced on those subjects is already available.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book, except as a source of Feynman trivia if that is your bag.  Indeed, I had heard most of these things before - either in films about the man or from his earlier writings.  As such, that makes this book the crassest attempt to commercially exploit the legacy of this great man yet again.  If such a thing were possible, the editor should be ashamed.	2003-07-16

Instead, it is an extremely dense essay by an original novelist on what makes India what it is:  chaotic, without a sense of historical continuity - his contrast with the European narrative that moves from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance/Reformation and Enlightenment to the industrial democracies is absolutely fascinating and yet deliciously succinct - and struggling to forge a modern identity in the post-colonial independence.  What the reader gets is an interpretation, the details of which (s)he must fill in or debate oneself.  Naipaul even does brilliant literary criticism of contemporary Indian novels in this book to shed light on his ideas, which as anecdotal and quirky as they are are always interesting.  Disagree we might, but he stimulates even in error.  Even after almost 30 years from its original publication, this essay is worth the read, if only to explore the reasoning behind rejecting it (I couldn't totally).<br />Warmly recommended.	2003-07-12

I am a longtime Nabokov fan and have read most of his books as well as several biographies and literary studies on the man.  The only conclusion that I can reach is that, in this novel that followed the huge success of Lolita, Nabokov somehow lost his self-critical facility and wrote it faster and with far fewer drafts, convinced by the critics' pronounements that he was a genius (and he certainly was) and hence couldn't go wrong.  This is what many of his critics and academic specialists say about this book - that it is sloppy and indulgent, and certainly nothing like his best work - and for once I completely agree with them.<br />Now a lot Nabokov devotees make fancy arguments about how this is his ultimate acheivement, a kind of cryptic Finnegin's Wake that engages the reader into a curious notion of time, etc etc.  Well, apart from my own idolisation of this fabulous writer, I really did not see anything to justify this in this book, unless you like such banalities as &quot;I don't analyse, I describe&quot; or Van Veen putting on sunglasses and wondering if the tint influences his sense of time.  Alas, a simpler explanation is that, in a fit of self-intoxication, the Nab got lazy with this book and simply blew it.<br />With all due respect to one of the greatest writers of the 20C, this book is too long, many of the scenes ring hollow, and the story is really strange.<br />Not recommended.	2003-07-04

THere is virtually no analysis, only poorly documented anecdotes.  SOme of them are very good - the chapter on the export of ice from New England to the Caribbean will stick in my mind for the rest of my life - and some much less.  From the reviews, it would seem that people liked Boorstin's approach very much.

Even better, the psychology of the characters is so finely drawn that it begs to be read again from cover to cover.  Things are never neatly and unrealistically resolved, but continually appear in their full ambiguity, so much like real life.  While not exactly a historical novel that depicts a period with total accuracy, it is one of the first great psychology novels ever written, and indeed is in a league with Stendhal in that respect.  As this has been extrensively reviewed, I will leave plot descriptions to others.<br />This is a classic that truly lives up to its reputation.  Highest recommendation.	2003-06-21

It is written in absolutely luminous prose, with a clarity that can only be called perfect.  As he travels with the geologist, ideas keep cropping up that are explained and examined, sometimes adding historical context, such as the long passages on Agassiz.  I enjoyed the flow of the narrative and it held my interest completely, indeed I was in awe of his writing talent.<br />In my reading, there were two principal scientific ideas.  First, McPhee lets the geologist question the pervasive acceptance of plate tectonics, that is, how it is now the first explanation that geologists seek to advance, which may mean that they do not seek alternative explanations when appropriate.  More specifically, the geologist accepts the theory for oceanic plates, but not the land/continental versions.  She chafes against the preference of many young geologists to create micro-plates for every new unexplained phenomenon, a kind of reductionism that may be similar to that used by proponents of &quot;heavenly spheres&quot; to explain the motions of the planets prior to Kepler and Newton.  Second, McPhee goes over the notion of glacial ice flows and what they explain about the current landscapes.  As I was quite ignorent of these theories except in the crudest outline, I learned a lot from this.  What I cannot do is evaluate whether, after 20 years, this book is outdated, which it almost certainly is.<br />Beyond those 2 issues, the reader also gets to know how geologists work and think, which was equally fascinating and pleasurable for me.  THere are long passages on a technique that the geologist developed - using the teeth of long-disappeared marine worms to date and evaluate the conditions of the sediments in which they appear - that are clearly explained.  Nonetheless, the level of the reasoning and vocabulary can at times be technical and was sometimes beyond my level:  those &quot;teeth&quot; above are called conodonts, which I happened to know about from a Gould essay; otherwise, I would have found use of that word confusing, as I did many others that are explained perhaps once.  THat made the book quite dense and necessary to re-read in certain sections, which is not a criticism so much as an indication of the experience the reader should expect.<br />Warmly recommended.l and was sometimes beyond my level:  those &quot;teeth&quot; above are called conodonts, which I happened to know about from a Gould essay; otherwise, I would have found use of that word confusing, as I did many others that are explained perhaps once.

Of course, his world of appearences comes crashing down on him when the going gets rough. ALong the way, there is lots about post-War American society as well as the ravages of aging.<br />Unfortunately, given this great premise and the inexplicable fact that it won a Pulitzer, this novel fails on many levels. First, it is written in a rambling, almost stream-of-consciousness style that is distracting but also totally failed to envelope me in its rhythm and world-view. It is personal taste to a degree, but I simply did not like it much. Second, while the tragedy is piercing and frightening to any parent, the novel keeps leaning towards melodrama without quite wholly falling into it. I mean, the guy could appear to have a charmed life without marrying a former Miss New Jersey and then suffer from something less than his beloved child becoming a fanatic political murderer. Life is hard, illusions are shattered, and falls are brutal by far less than all Roth's soap-operattish exaggeration. Third, the only truly three-dimensional character is the Swede, the paragon who crumbles under all the pain. You see him from a lot of angles, whereas the women remain the merest caricatures, peeping into his constructs and illusions without gaining much real life throughout. Even his brother is in the end easy to label as the angry-brother-become-arrogant-surgeon as is his harddriving-poor-immigrant's-son father. And none of these characters, not even the Swede, is rich enough to live on in my imagination.<br />WHile I was disappointed in these problems, which I believe make this novel mediocre, there were many interesting points, but again they tend to be personal and I don't believe would carry over for most other readers. I lived for a time in the New Jersey he describes and travelled often through bombed-out Newark, about whose history Roth informed me in the book.  I also very much enjoyed the stuff about the glove industry, but then as a business writer I admire business owners. Moreover, I knew people like the Swede and Roth makes a convincing case for the confusing anguish they feel when things go very wrong. Plus, as I said, it brings the parent's ultimate fears for their kids to the surface. Finally, there is the panorama of American life, which Roth succeeds in evoking, but again that can be viewed as parochial and of little interest, say, to my European friends, most of whom did not like this novel.<br />In balance, I did enjoy this novel and it got me to think, but I expected a far, far better performance.

The basic plot is about a marriage in crisis, but every time the reader thinks (s)he knows what's going on, more surprises - all horrendous and shocking - are just around the corner.  Alliances and new life commitments are made and re-made in every chapter, to the point that just about every combination is eventually tried and tested and rejected, without ever reaching an equilibrium.  The narrator is constantly confused and yet slogging ahead (with the help of a lot of drink) and trying to find a safe love along with total love, perhaps from more than one woman.  The whole thing reads like a relentless parlor comedy, and often feels unrealistic, but the purpose of Murdock seems to be to get the reader to reconsider his/her life while laughing and yet horrified at the actions of the characters.  It is, in my view, an exquisite balance of pain and ironic humor, a masterwork really.  It also highlights how different the cultures are that share a language across the Atlantic:  Brits really do have extremely different ideas about how to behave, including staying polite and nice in the face of the cruellest spousal betrayals and hypocrisy, though there are small eruptions of erotic violence.  THe ending is just as confusing and unexpected as the rest of the book, and the trajectory that the characters will follow is totally unpredictable, which means they are vivid enough to live in the readers' mind.<br />Warmly recommended.  THis can be read and re-read with profit, and I certainly will.  It is a great gift book for the discerning reader.	2003-05-28

His sarcasm is so biting, his vision so clear - if often dead flat wrong as when he predicted the Soviet Union would win the cold war - that I have been entertained as much as I have learned from reading his books and columns.  His is a truly great writer.<br />With this book, you get to know that man and his times.  WHile brilliant and capable of incredible discipline, he lets on that he was not a serious student and hence was not made of the stuff of academics.  Because I like him, I enjoyed learning all the details of his life, from his beginnings in Marseille, to his entry into the Ecole Normale - where Sartre and Aron studied with many of the most eminent French writers of the 20C - to his briliant career as a journalist.  He did very interesting things, from introducing Luis Bunuel's Mexican period to a mass audience to helping the writer of Papillon to become a household name in the 197os to hanging out with opium smokers in the Hotel Regina in the 1950s (the first hotel I stayed in in Paris and so a special treat).  Of course, he was also in the French resistance in a minor way!  You read of the genesis of his many books, which included philosophy, lit crit, political polemics, gastronomy, and many other subjects.  Then there is his combat as an editor of the distinguished weekly magazine L'Express with the ideologically rigid extreme left, which he takes up with the most remarkable gusto and humor.<br />This can serve as a history of the political ideas of the second half of the 20C with a perspective that many Americans will enjoy, admire, and undersatnd, which these days is more difficult than one would care to imagine.  I read in on moving back to Europe after an absence of 15 years and enjoyed every single page.<br />Warmly recommended.	2003-05-28

Walter Lippman was the first modern journalist of the US: in a time of parochialism, self-congratulatory muckraking, and yellow journalism, he had an internationalist perspective and strove to introduce the American people to new ideas. At the same time, he was deeply interested in the currents of virtually all major political movements in America, and he studied and then participated in them as an opinion maker. What is truly remarkable about the book is the way that Steel recounts the elements of these movements - encapsulates them in brilliant and stimulating descriptions - in paragrpah after paragraph on the development of Lippman's restless and omnivorous mind. He starts with the muckrakers and Lincoln Steffens as well as Wilson's ideas on the League of nations, moved through the implications of Freud for public policy, to the New Deal (and the ideas of Keynes), the Cold War, and his last great battle on the Vietnam War. But as Lippman looks at each of these problems, he also critiques them, probing for their limitations before moving on to the next great movement. The result is an absolutely first-rate intellectual history of about the first 70 years of the 20C, which in my opinion were far more interesting than the remaining 30. With each movement, at least for me, I wanted to learn more, to go back to the sources and other histories and biographies. Finally, there are also fascinating anecdotes of his intereactions with the great politicos of his time, from his dismissal of FDR as a mediocre thinker to a screaming argument at a party with Dean Acheson over the COld War - \\"it was two titans facing off\\" - to the bitter obsession that LBJ developed about him in the 1960s.<br />Of course, Lippman had a charmed career and sprung from an elite background. This made him somewhat insensitive or disinterested in some developments that hurt people, from the Ku Klux Klan to the McCarthy era. Nonetheless, as Steel points out, in his conservatism he also reflected the most popular opinions of his time, which is the reason he was so relevant.<br />Steel also gives us a portrait of the man, and it is charming and admiring. His father was a slum lord, of whom he was ashamed and Steel speculates that Lippman's life was a search for a better father figure in American politicians. He also had an empty first marriage, which he abandoned when he fell in love with his best friend's wife, renewing his life in middle age and breaking a number of 1950s taboos. THe portrait is quite moving.<br />This is a truly great book, and I hope that it will be viewed as a classic someday. I learned an immense amount and felt hungry for more, which is my principal criterion for true excellence in writing.<br />Highest recommendation.conservatism he also reflected the most popular opinions of his time, which is the reason he was so relevant.<br />Steel also gives us a portrait of the man, and it is charming and admiring.

Though not exactly chronological, the stories in this volume tend to occur later than in the first volume and are often longer, which is understandable given that Julius Caesar and Alex the Great are covered in this volume.  THe stories are also more intricately interwoven - you get lives that overlap, such as those of Brutus and Caesar, with slightly different takes and details in each one.  The upshot of all this is that the serious reader will need to keep this around as a reference, going over the text again when some question of detail comes up or to refresh one's point of view.  Plutarch's take on things is very different from that of many authors:  he is a pro-aristocrat conservative and admiring of martial prowess, yet pro-Republican.  Once again, the reader really needs to know the historical context before undertaking this. It is not at all introductory.<br />Warmly recommended.

Only Edmund Wilson, whose erudition as an autodidact was unsurpassed in his time, could have pulled this off:  the ideas and inspiration pulse with life on every page.  You get to know Marx, ENgels, and scores of other characters intimately as they dream of building a socialist order that would fundamentally re-order society and its economy.  WHile I was never a sympathiser for communism, this most certainly gave me a feeling for the seductive beauty of the dream.  THere is even a forward by Wilson, who admits to being overly optimistic, that what he chronicled with such excitment actually led to &quot;one of the most horrible tyrannies in the history of mankind.&quot;  THis is intellectual history at its very best, freed in the hands of a master writer from the pedantry and puffery of academia, and unflinching in the audacity of its partisan interpretations.

It has beautiful pictures and a dense-looking text, so I thought it was well worth the price.  Well, I was sorely disappointed, now that I have read it carefully.  To boot, I don't remember much in terms of ideas and I finished it last night!  What I had hoped was to gain knowledge on the context of recent developments in Italian design - why is it so great, what does it reflect, and what are the forces behind it.  Alas, this book offers virtually none of that.  Instead, the reader finds an abstruce and poorly translated text that is full of overly intellectualised statements in the fluffy style of Italian writers.  We are advised \\"a transverse reading is recommended\\" and other breazy observations that are utterly banal, like technology drives design.  ...Moreover, many of the objects in the book are from the mid-1980s and stop about 1995, which badly dates the book even thought it wasa published in 1999.<br />Not recommended.

I got to know a bit about the politics, and in particular the insidiousness of the Berlusconi politico-business machine, as well as a bit about the culture, such as why their television programs are perhaps the worst in the developed world. There is also a lot about the Italian penchant for wild conspiracy theories in a very interesting investigation into the many unexplained acts of terrorism of the last few decades.  However, while there was nothing patently wrong in it that I found, the more I read the less I felt like I was learning - that is an odd feeling, but the author starts to repeat himself and meander into more and more personal stories that lack relevance, at least for me. (Did I really need to know that his \\"favorite student\\" at the Univeristy came on to him in the spring by pumping her hips in her chair?) In addition, as I am not a soccer enthusiast, I grew very bored with the large amount of coverage the sport got as a \\"reflection\\" of the culture.<br />While Jones has a pleasant writing style for a journalist, when he attempted to expand his good - though definitely throw-away - articles into a book, his talents appeared to fall short to me. At the end of each chapter, for example, he adds some silly observation that leads to the theme of the next chapter, which becomes a very tedious and contrived device.<br />This is a good intro, just not that good.

While the objects should certainly be able to speak for themselves, and they do, their age and what they meant at the time of their invention need far more explanation than is available here.  Indeed, many pages have only a paragarph or less of text, a mere supplement to beautiful photos.<br />That being said, I learned a lot about the early history of industrial design from this book, from its origins as a reaction to the drab and near-featurelessness of early efforts to mass manufacture everyday objects to the abstract philosophy of the constructionists and the heavy duty functionalism of the Bauhaus.  The longest treatment is rightfully reserved for Bauhaus and its immediate predecessors in the Werkbund, all Germans who were attempting to systematically merge artistic expression with the demands of industrial production, thereby creating a new movement.  These developments are covered to a near-acceptable degree, but the language is confusing and often abstruce or cryptic and hence hard to understand.  THe text also assumes a lot of knowledge and hence is not introductory, though at least it does not get lost in academic jargon.<br />I got the lightest introduction to the early history of industrial design in this book, but obviously I wanted more.  I guess I will have to keep reading.  Also, the Art Deco movement, which is a French/American development from the same period and largely a reaction to the utilitarianism and minimalism of the Germanic schools, is mentioned in a single paragraph and hence left completely unexplored.<br />One thing that really struck me was the direct line of continuity with much contemporary design.  There must be subtle differences that I hope to discover later, but it made a lot of what I admire now look derivative.

After having read McCullogh's splendid series on Rome, I turned to this fat, dense book with great expectations. I was not disappointed: the stories are endlessly fascinating, from their basic details on ancient history to the bizarre asides that reveal the pre-Christianised mind-set of the author.<br />Like all great books, this one can be read on innumerable levels. First, there is the moralising philosophy that is perhaps the principal purpose of the author to advance - each life holds lessons on proper conduct of great and notorious leaders alike. You get Caesar, Perikles, and Alcibiades, and scores of others who are compared and contrasted. Second, there is the content. Plutarch is an invaluable source of data for historians and the curious. Third, there is the reflection of religious and other beliefs of the 1C AD: oracles and omens are respected as are the classical gods. For example, while in Greece, Sulla is reported as having found a satyr, which he attempted unsuccesfully to question for its auguring abilities during his miltary campaign in Greece! It is a wonderful window into the mystery of life and human belief systems. That being said, Plutarch is skeptical of these occurances and both questions their relevance and shows how some shrewd leaders, like Sertorious with his white fawn in Spain, used them to great advantage.<br />Finally, this is a document that was used for nearly 2000 years in schools as a vital part of classical education - the well-bred person knew all these personalities and stories, which intimately informed their vocabulary and literary references until the beginning of the 20C. That in itself is a wonderful view into what was on people's minds and how they conceived things over the ages. As is well known, Plutarch is the principal source of many of Shakespeare's plays, such as Coriolanus and Julius Caesar. But it was also the source of the now obscure fascination with the rivalry of Marius and Sulla, as depicted in paintings and poetry that we still easily encounter if we are at all interested in art. Thus, this is essential reading for aspiring pedants (like me).<br />Of course, there are plenty of flaws in the work. It assumes an understanding of much historical detail, and the cases in which I lacked it hugely lessened my enjoyment. At over 320 years old, the translation is also dated and the prose somewhat stilted, and so it took me 300 pages to get used to it.

It assumes an understanding of much historical detail, and the cases in which I lacked it hugely lessened my enjoyment. At over 320 years old, the translation is also dated and the prose somewhat stilted, and so it took me 300 pages to get used to it.

What is written is sloppily researched and there are frequent mistakes that are appalling:  Ideo, for example, is repeatedly called Ideo Europe.

However, I was not satisfied with the level of detail of each story:  not only did each case study make it appear that an optimal design was acheived, but it undercovered the human and organizational dramas that underlie such design processes.  In many instances, there is a whiff of the true complexity and it made my mouth water, but then didn't go deep enough.  As a result, the whole process comes off too logical and rational, too panglossian if you wish.<br />From my own experience, I know that the design process is far more difficult than the reader would glean from the book.  Designers, like artists, are high strung people who live for and in their work - if you criticise their work, you are criticising them personally and they react.  Their egos are as big as their talents.  Bitter fights result with engineers and the holders of the corporate largesse, the purse strings that make or break an experiment.  THere are difficult compromises, often political, and plenty of ongoing acrimony. How should they be handled and nurtured?  Does a separate group need to be insulated?  Should they just grow up or would that kill part of the creative process?  None of this is sufficiently covered in this book and they all represent key management issues.  Moreover, there is not enough about the companies in the book - who they are, what they believe in terms of philosophy, how they calculate and market themselves.<br />Nonetheless, the stories are exciting and the photography is excellent.  Certain common techniques also emerge, such as the importance of rapid prototyping and marketing shortcuts that don't ignore cumstomer needs but rather find way to tap into new ones.  These too are fascinating issues that require deeper treatment.<br />Recommended, but only as a start.	2003-04-10

There are 5 essays, each on a decade of design starting in 1950.  They are succinct, very well written, and interesting in that they look at the more general history of the period as well as covering the design movements.  However, they are so short that you can read them all in a single sitting, which is what I just did.  As I am quite ignorent of design history, it was extremely enlightening for me - I now feel ready for a bigger meal.  It was the ideal preparation for a project I am embarking on on design.  Furthermore, there are wonderful photos and features on many famous objects, all of which have solid descriptions of what the design innovation represented and what is new about them.  All in all, it is a masterful book even if I expected just a bit more.<br />Recommmended to beginners in the field and as a reference.	2003-04-10

In a word, these have been the best and most fascinating continuous historical novels that I have ever read. As with friendships, of course, they age: there is no question that McCullough has said her piece and done her thing and this is where it should stop: while the section leading to Caesar's assassination is wonderful, the aftermath in which the assassins are hunted down systematically or simply self-destruct has the feel of too abrupt a summary. Perhaps after a certain time her imagination will replenish itself, and a new series will follow.<br />At the heart of the novel, in my reading, Caesar has taken on too much even for a man of universal genius (military, political, rhetorical, and in governance) and is exhausted and almost tired of living. As he deals defeat after defeat to his old foes, whom he hopes will survive to offer him an opposition that can strengthen him and help him refine his ideas, his vision for Roman society remains unsurpassed and more far-seeing than everyone else. He is also searching for an heir and communing with (the ugly) Cleopatra, who comes off as an intelligent, if rather conventional and brutal autocrat. He challenges her to think more broadly of the future, and attempts to transmit much of his vision to her in the few spare moments they have to talk.<br />Then, as Caesar returns to the wreckage and chaos of a Rome rent by decades of civil war, he confronts the mismanagement of less gifted and visionary men in a towering rage, which makes him take on the enormous task of setting the capital back on its feet and creates new enemies. He is disappointed that no one of the stature of Cicero or his old Boni adversaries emerges. In McCulloughs' view, Caesar is the last great republican of a growing empire that requires autocracy to function with its immense size and complexity.<br />Caesar's heir, who uses his inherited \\"godhead\\" with ruthless shrewdness, is a very different man: he is as cold-blooded as a cobra, vengeful rather than offering clemency to his Roman foes, and full of patient guile (\\"he doesn't need to die yet\\"); he is sickly rather than robust, and while handsome lacks the sexual magnetism of his mentor. While hardly a military genius like Caesar, he grows into political manipulation and subterfuge at an extremely tender age, which remains unexplained. The portrait is truly fascinating, a taste of the new system of government to come, but it is here that McCulloughs' energy begins to wane. The reader, at least in my case, cannot understand what he is planning and why he acts as he does in many instances. Thus, it is just the lightest taste of what this man will become and do.<br />There are a number of personalities that continue to develop in this volume, most of whom meet their fates with all of the brutality one might expect from a semi-savage society. The reader sees Cicero, Brutus, Mark Anthony, Cato and many many others in novel and wonderful interpretations, all of it stimulating the desire to learn more. Sometimes melodramatic, McCullough has done her homework with the historical details and it is a feast for the imagination. While the finishing chapters are too brief, the writing remains solid, if unexceptional. This is not high literature, but very very good storytelling. Finally, through this coverage of politics and personalities, McCulloguh brilliantly succeeds in portraying Roman society in great depth, from the intrigues of the Forum to the mismanaged and brutalised subjects in the provinces.<br />I will miss this series very much, but it was time for it to end, at least for now.

The frame of the story is from the point of view of a maid, whose family has fallen from relative affluence and hence she was forced into degrading labor in spite of her considerable intelligence.<br />The sensibility is extremely delicate and prosaic, in that what the maid worries incessantly about are everyday battles for status within the household with children, another maid, and Vermeer's spoilt and narrow-minded spouse. Indeed, the maid's world, while complete in all its distressing detail, is petty to the point of boredom for the reader, or at least for me. Because her personal freedom and possibility were so sadly limited, I could not identify beyond a certain point with her anxieties and hopes as she was forced into a succession of servitudes and humiliations. Moreover, there is not a single jot of humor. Nonetheless, late in the book, her relationship with Vermeer becomes very interesting indeed, as he puts her into a painting as a model for a rich patron - the psychology is subtle and far-reaching. The reader also gets some perspective on the tensions between Catholic and Protestant groups that persisted even in the tolerant cities of Holland.<br />Recommended, but tepidly.	2003-03-11

Not only does he have fascinating insights into science, but each of his books is a literary event of exceptional clarity, with elegant yet distinctively quirky prose and humor. Reading his books, I think, is like drinking truly fine wine, each sip to savor and each vintage subtly different.<br />This book covers a revolution that Gould argues was hidden from the public, that is, the complete reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale, which is the most important Cambrian fossil bed ever to have been found. In my reading, there were two fundamental ideas Gould wanted to get across: 1) that, with explosions of new forms of life that follow grand extinctions or leaps in evolutionary development, there is actually more rather than less diversity in basic forms; 2) this fact flatly contradicts our assumptions that life \\"progresses\\" by becoming ever more complex (and to some, evolutionarily superior, culminating in man). What Gould says is that, if you rewound the tape of life through all the contingencies that led to homo sapiens, it is more likely than not that we would never have existed. He would, in other words, remove us from the inevitability of occupying the apex of life's hierarchy.<br />For anyone familiar with Gould's essays, which I believe rank as works of genius in the genre of science popularization, will recognize these themes. What sets this book apart is his systematic, highly technical argument from the evidence of the re-interpretation. Much of the revolution depends on the numbers of joints in fossil legs, rendering them different than all the insect species that evolved from different ancestors, and other minutiae that Gould describes with peerless elegance.  As such, I believe, he has succeeded in producing that most difficult of books: hard science for specialists that is also intended for the interested (and persistent) lay reader. This is a true virtuoso performance that is an incredible pleasure to read. As always, the persona he presents in the book is wonderfully companionable and open-minded.<br />As a reporter of science, I was surprised to learn that Gould was disdained by many of his colleagues at Harvard and the wider Cambridge area as having fallen behind the more mathematical and progressist-evolutionary approaches that have taken over the field of paleontology and biology. As I understood it - and this does not fully do justice to the objections of these scholars to Gould - they seemed to feel that he was wrong when he argued that many attributes did not have meaning or evolutionary significance and hence all should not be treated as such (i.e. catalogued ad infinitum in a scholastic manner that ignores certain assumptions). Instead, in my reading, Gould argued that, when catastrophic changes in the environment killed off huge numbers of species, the traits that allowed some to survive were usually evolved for other reasons and were perhaps redundant or useless at the time of the event. This book makes the most detailed case for Gould's position on these issues. I happen to believe that Gould is correct and that the vogue may one day shift back in his direction, i.e. become less determinist.<br />Warmly recommended.read.

As such, it offers a fascinating look into a medium that was evolving and how a group of great innovators molded the process.<br />Creating great comedy is not just about funny guys doing strange things. As with all true innovators, great comedians also tend to be members of great teams. Their goals are similar to those of visionary businessmen, scientists, and designers: they want to achieve something revolutionary and they want to advance their careers and, by extension, make money. That is why Your Show of Shows, a 1950s American television comedy series starring Sid Caesar, offers fascinating lessons on one of the most successful creative teams in TV. Not only did Caesar's writers challenge the standard practices of a new and rapidly evolving industry, but they did so consistently over a number of years with seemingly impossible deadlines every week.<br /><br />How did they do it? In a nutshell, Sid Caesar put a group of phenomenally talented writers into an empty room and let them be themselves while offering subtle, if occasionally brutal, hints at how they should work together rather than directing (or \\"micro-managing\\") them. Caesar nurtured an environment to spawn creativity and he had a great producer behind him who knew how to line up corporate support. Amazingly - and typical of the audacity that went into this show - the first few shows were aired without sponsorship and yet were unprecedented in their production costs.<br />The group included Mel Brooks, who went on to create a number of pioneering comedies. Woody Allen also got his big break as part of Caesar's team and later came into his own as an Oscar-winning scriptwriter and filmmaker. In addition, there was the celebrated producer, director, writer, and comedian Carl Reiner (creator of The Dick Van Dyke Show) as well as Larry Gelbart, who created of the M*A*S*H television series and the Broadway play City of Angels. Finally, prior to becoming one of America's most successful Broadway playwrights, Neil Simon began his writing career on the Caesar show. In spite of their huge egos and now-famous eccentricities, this group worked as a team, sometimes offering solo performances, but always as a part of something bigger than themselves alone.<br />These personalities stand out in the book, in all their quirkiness and egotism and talent. The pressure on the team was enormous: not only would they have to meet the highest standards of sophistication, quality, and originality as set by Caesar and Liebman, who did not want the ordinary slapstick that was popular then, but every week Caesar and the other performers would have to entertain a live audience during a 90-minute, nationwide broadcast. Caesar describes it as putting on half of a Broadway play - new - each week, and doing it in real time. As such, it is also a facinating study of leadership, even if by a comedian.<br />Nonetheless, there are long sections of descriptions of the shows' content.  I found that boring, but it is a matter of taste and what you are expecting.  I was looking more for a histrry of TV and how an innovative team worked, and I got it in this book very satisfactorily.

Unfortunately, while the content of it is utterly fascinating, the way it is written - or translated - leaves much to be desired: the style is flat and dull, frequently unclear, and simply a chore to plod through.<br />That being said, it covers the flowering of Athens as an imperialist democracy after the defeat of the Persian invasion that briefly united Greece. In the wake of the peace that followed, Athens used the Delian League to create an empire, drawing enormous wealth into the city state and dominating innumerable smaller states, eventually threatening the hegemony of the Spartans in the Pelopponesus. By developing a naval empire, the Athenians needed to enlist the loyalty of lower classes to man the boats and serve as hoplites, which encouraged the development of direct democracy.<br />Meier meticulously covers the details of these developments in a masterful synthesis of scholarship - it is a kind of updating of the Kulturgeschichte of Burckhart and is very valuable. THe reader is treated to the unique characteristics of Athens as well: it was in an era before there were \\"specialists\\" and so everyone was expected to participate in the city's governance, sometimes by elections and sometimes by lot; for historical reasons, Greece had lacked heredity kingships (and empires) to fall back on, preferring instead to guard the independence of smaller and more directly governable city states.<br />What was particularly interesting was Meier's portrayal of the excitment - the sense that all boundaries were crumbling - that permeated Athens of this period. In this he is certainly correct: we see the rise of Perikles, the great Greek trajedians, the beginning of modern philosophy, the flowering of artistic realism, and new forms of architecture. Meier views all of these developments as of a living organism, mixing political history with art criticism and long interpretations of the contemporary events that the dramas may have been referring to. In spite of these achievements, Meier also studies the fatal flaws and contradictions of this democratic experiment, in Athens' need to subjugate others in the name of democracy, the tendency of the citizens to indulge in excess and sudden blame, and the rise of demagogues. Thus, the portrait of the city is very well rounded. From that point, Meier moves to more military history, chronicalling the catastrophies of the Peloponessian War in painful detail. It is here, really, that the notion of the West and Europe were born.<br />However, it is amazing to me that the book is so poorly edited. The prose is leaden and utterly lacking in style, as in so much of the academic tradition. But the content is so interesting and compelling that it kept my interest through 600 pages.

Alas, though Bennis is a brilliant man and great expert on leadership, his book fails on many counts.<br />First, throughtout the text, the ideas are not that well delineated. So you get lots of stories that are often  intersting and fun, but you wonder why all the details are included.  Second, I didn't see what the book really adds:  sure leaders can be both remarkable and difficult; sure, some teams are extraordinary; sure, we could use more great teams.  But how do you do it?  THe book doesn't provide much on that as a practical guide (its third failing).<br />Nonetheless, I thought this book was very well written, which is almost certainly Bierderman's contribution.  ALso, it is fun to read the stories on their own.  Finally, the sumup chapter has useful ideas (and frankly, it - just 15 pages - is all that you would need to read if you don't find the stories inherently interesting).<br />Tepidly recommended.	2003-02-08

Much of that is very abstruce and admittedly over my head - I was reading the book in preparation for a writing project I am embarking upon on the company.<br />That being said, the images are fantastic and you get to know a lot about the company and the incredible family that founded and still manages it. It just isn't easy to read. Thus, I would recommend this book for those who want to know very deeply about this unique company, which is probably the best design firm for household goods in Europe if not the world.

It is written by an independent scholar with a quirky, yet erudite, point of view who writes very well, with the Cartesian clarity that we expect of French intellectuals.<br />I found it absolutely fascinating, as he explained the politics that gave rise to the astonishing building projects that involved entire communities for centuries and whose artisans are, with the exception of Villard, wholly unkown. Gimpel then goes through the crytic notebook of Villard - the only true record of the era's methods besides the works themselves - deciphering it for non-specialists like myself. In his view, built during a late-medieval economic boom, the cathedrals used a new kind of geometry and practical experimentation that foreshadowed the discoveries of the Renaissance.  Some would even argue that the gothic cathedral architects and builders presaged the scientific method that emerged during the Enlightenment.  Gimpel provides plenty of fodder for that interpretation.<br />Warmly recommended.	2003-01-22

It takes up more or less a few decades after the retirement of one of the greatest businessmen of the 20C (TWatson Jr.), when the business had lost its way and was under attack by extremely nimble rivals.<br />Gerstner took over the failing, almost bankrupt, company and both re-made its startegy and culture, re-focusing it on customer needs and re-engineering it (i.e. laying off an awful lot of people). In this book, he tells the outlines of how he did it, which is indeed extremely interesting. In particular, he stresses that while a strategy is needed, implementation of it is far more important.<br />Unfortunately, he does not go into enough detail for the reader to fully understand what he faced and how he did it. Neither the technology nor the brutal methods he had to employ were adequately addressed, at least for me. I read it carefully and did not feel I had had quite the full meal I expected. The reader also gets virtually no insight into what makes Gerstner tick, other than that he \\"wants to win\\" with passion. THe book was also entirely written by Gerstner; his style is competent, if somewhat like a business memo: good analyses are \\"actionable\\" and effective actions are \\"impactful.\\"<br />Nonetheless, this is a very good primer on basic strategy and organizational behavior. He has lots of valuable advice to give and pinpoints many important issues. I will keep it and return to it.<br />THere were some things that I found questionable and surprising, if also unintentionally revealing. FOr example, he made IBM both an honest broker in offering comprehensive technology-based business solutions - for the first time, its employees could recommend the hardware of competitors if they better suited the customers' needs - while another part of the company continued to strive to produce the best hardware. This flatly contradicts both what Porter advises and Gerstner himself argues elsewhere in the book regarding the self-reinforcing compatibility of the elements of a business strategy and makes me question if Gerstner really thought it all thru. In addition, he astonishingly posits that Japanese business reporters are the best in the world, when in fact - and I worked in Japan for Nikkei, a leading business news wire service - they are merely part of the PR apparatus of firms, reporting verbatim what they were told to report by companies!

What it offers is an interesting interpretation of the Spartan warrior elite, which is well done but in my view excessively limited.<br />Pressfield's goal was, of course, just that: to show what it was like to fight a crucial battle in a war that was without a doubt one of the most decisive and significant in history - without Leonidas' strategic victory - they battled to the death but helped to inspire the Greeks to unite and win the greater war - Athens may never have flowered, developing not only democracy but also philosophy, theatre, and classical art and architecture. That is my beef with this book: virtually none of this, which was brewing below the surface, is covered except as an afterthought. As such, you get to know the Spartans in the most positive light possible - excessive in my opinion - and very very little about far more significant though embryonic currents.<br />Nonetheless, what Pressfield wanted to do he did very well. REcommended.	2003-01-06

It is far more limited geographically in that about 90% of it is about France and it is also edited rather poorly: many of the chapters are chock full of vague generalizations that require far more historical knowledge than I had to evaluate them (my failing, perhaps, but also an indication of the level of the book). Finally, many of the chapters were far less fun than the ones in the previous two volumes.<br />That being said, there are absolutely wonderful nuggets embedded throughout the book. This is, afterall, the era when the individual emerges en masse from the \\"community\\" mentality of the middle ages, as the absolutist state (and its embryonic legal system) replaces the more relationship-based bonds of feudal communties. This had innumerable consequences, including the development of public schools on a widespread basis and a sense of justice as administered by the state rather than by a feudal lord who demanded personal loyalty.<br />THere are also many episodes within this that make for great reading. For example, there is a whole chapter on the development of accepted manners for the middle classes and even below, based on those of the court but also on books on etiquette such as one written by Erasmus himself, which astounded me as I learned its various editions were influential for over 300 years on wuch topics as acceptable table manners. THere were also chapters on charivari - a kind of moralistic razzing of newlyweds that combined extortion and youthful exuberance, carried out as they were (sometimes for months) by amoral thugs! Even the notion of childhood - of the child having a distinctive personality with his/her own requirements and needs - was developed in this period. ANd of course, there is the growth of the practive of friendship by choice, so rare in the middle ages, rather than via kinship ties or feudal obligation, which had subordinated most feelings to the survival of the extended clan.<br />Nonetheless, these delightful chapters are buried in many dull and poorly written ones that were a terrible slog to get through. I was very disappointed by this, having loved the volumes on the ancient world and the middle ages. Perhaps it was marked by the death of the founding editor. I will try the later volumes, but worry they will not measure up. The title is also misleading: this volume is less about the Renaissance than what followed, that is, the period of religious wars and the development of absolutism.<br />REcommended to those willing to make the effort, but not for the casual reader.ival of the extended clan.<br />Nonetheless, these delightful chapters are buried in many dull and poorly written ones that were a terrible slog to get through.

THis is a long book, 900 pages in the French version, but I sliced through so fast that I was sorry when it ended.<br />The plot outline is simple. The four musketeers - for there really are four - want to help the queen in her love for Lord Buckingham of England. All the rest is intrigue and adventure related to that. But the episodes are so funny, the chemistry between the characters so subtle and realistic, that it makes for a truly great read. Indeed, the characters of the musketeers are so well drawn, their inter-relations so complex, that a film or even a miniseries simply cannot do it justice. The glimpses at historical personnages is also fascinating, from Richelieu to Louis XIII. Finally, you get a flavor for the Paris of that epoch, with the rumbling of the religious wars in the background.  But this is not a dark book, Like the Reine Margot:  it is a great frolic of brotherhood and good guys and bad guys.  Taken for what it is, it is one of the greatest.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-12-07

The interaction of these groups, which is one of my specialties as a business writer, is extremely complex. What is the problem? What should be done? Realistically, what can be done? These are the questions I wrestle with and that I sought to have answered in this book.<br />Unfortunately, I did not find them covered very well and far too many issues receive only a partial treatment. For starters, Schoenberger does not really define the problem with clarity or consistency. At one point, he goes into the universal declaration of human rights and then into a long chapter on China and whether companies should pull out to protest the repressive regime. There is also a long chapter with a vague political history of Burma that goes into far too much detail to make his point that MNCs, in pulling out, had an impact. But China is too big for any one company to affect much, and too important as a potential market as well, so that is not a realistic or even meaningful option in my opinion - a mosquito can't attack an elephant. At another point, it seems to be the working conditions in factories that concern the author. As such, the book kind of flails around from issue to issue without very clear criteria as to what he is looking for and what would be a good outcome.<br />Then, there is Schoenberger's choice of Levi-Strauss as the anchor for his story. Now that is an interesting company - it really tried to implement practical ethical practices and/or codes throughout its long history - but I wonder if it was the right choice. While Schoenberger used it to illustrate that there may be unreconcilable contradictions between the demands of profit-making and behaving ethically, I am not at all sure that Levi-Strauss is really at the cutting edge of the implementation of global corporate codes. There are other companies, such as adidas-Salomon AG, which are addressing precisely the questions that Schoenberger sees as problems at Levi's: namely, transparency, credibility, and the balance between using human rights as a crude marketing ploy and really trying to have a positive impact. I witnessed how adidas was, in my opinion, successfully dealing with these questions: that company produced reports that were honest about what areas needed improvement and hence were not a simple PR whitewash. That represents real progress and something new, at least to me, and Schoenberger did not seem to have any inkling of these things, which were under development while he was writing this book.<br />Moreover, Schoenberger did not successfully get inside Levi's in any deep way, so he has written as an outsider who lacks direct and intimate access to the top thinkers there. That means that, in spite of the legitimate distance that reporters need to maintain from their subjects, many of his conclusions are far more speculative than he lets on. For a reporter, he did far too little reporting.<br />It was very interesting to me to read on things that I myself investigated here. There is a chapter on Sialkot, Pakistan, which I visited to investigate an initiative to eliminate children from soccer ball manufacturing. Well, Schoenberger covers it very very poorly and fails to ask the right questions: for him, child labor is simply bad but it is hard to get rid of. What I saw was that it was an economic necessity to some families for kids to work - and they wanted to - and the introduction of the program, which was a good one and sincerely well intended, had many side affects that were unforeseen, such as eliminating many women from the work force (due to local custom, they had to work in their homes and hence couldn't travel to the regulated centers in outside towns that the initiative established) and the rise of a new black market that paid less well than it had before because middlemen claimed they took on extra risk. Yet Schoenberger reports on none of these ambiguities, preferring to fault the program's design for poor monitoring of the results. That, in my opinion, is bad reporting and it made me suspect everything else he wrote.<br />The author is quite hard on NGOs, such as the Clean Clothes Campaign and its shoddy methods, and yet seems to be arguing that they are necessary, if weaker, counter-weights to MNCs. This is a difficult area and far more needs to be written about it. As I see it, corporations need to work with them constructively or they risk becoming pawns in a much larger game, as did Nike which is a favorite \\"whipping boy\\" of the NGOs. Schoenberger also fails to cover the media's role adequately, as fashions come and go very quickly and corporations can be attacked ruthlessly regarding conditions that they were not responsible for creating, though may have been abetting indirectly.<br />Futhermore, the author's writing style bothered me.  He often employed this kind of over-heated rhetoric - too many adjectives! - that got in the way of the content.  This is a matter of taste, of course, but it is not elegant or cooly written.<br />For me, the usefulness of the book is that it filled a number of gaps in my knowledge and many readers, both generalists and specialists, would benefit from learning about those. But the treatment is flawed and incomplete, in particular regarding what corporations are actively doing to address the problems he raises.<br />Recommended with caution.re because middlemen claimed they took on extra risk.

Indeed, they have raised pride, scorn, and sarcasm to such high art. But they were also great pioneers, from the political caricatures of Daumier to modernism.<br />Germinal was one of the first truly excellent muckraker novels, exploring the complex tableau of oppressed workers in early industrial society. THough there is some excessive melodrama in the characters, they open a world that few would be able to know without direct experience. We should never forget how new this was, how much of a pioneer Zola was. It is a huge success.<br />But the novel also stands very well on its own. The writing is austerely beautiful, textured to feel as dusty and cold as the mines themselves. THere are realistic good guys and bad guys, highly complex characters who enter into difficult fights, who were types that Zola largely invented and that have been copied many many times. On every page, I wanted to find out what would happen to them, how they grew or died, where they were from. I hoped for them, pitied them, and hated them and even wept from them in the climactic ending when a glimmer of humanity transcended the class struggle for just a moment.<br />I was fascinated and repelled by the world Zola recreates, which has been my reaction to French culture throughout my contact with it for the last 34 years!	2002-12-07

A few truly excellent books come to mind, such as Rhodes' Making of the Atomic Bomb or Halberstam's Best and the Brightest.  This book is indisputably of that caliber and every page exudes the love of the author for its subject.<br /><br />Huntford tells the story of the conquest of the S Pole as a race between Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen just prior to the outbreak of the First World War.  On innumerable levels, the book is utterly fascinating:  as pure adventure, as a contrast of extraordinary personalities, and (my purpose in reading it) as a management challenge.  It also has plenty on the historical context, set against the beginning of the decline of the British Empire at the same time that a Norwegian nationalism was being forged.  It was also the last great exploration that was done largely without higher technological vehicles such as airplanes and land rovers.<br /><br />On the one hand, there is Scott, the quintessential bureaucrat of the British Navy:  he is most comfortable in a huge hierarchy that lends him indisputable authority and is driven by a smoldering ambition and hopes to advance himself via the discovery of the S Pole.  He is exceedingly rigid, arrogant yet painfully insecure, and pathetically unsuited to command.  His failure to learn, in part because he is more comfortable at a desk with books than in observing real life, eventually leads to the ultimate failure.  Nonetheless, he embodied a certain British romantic ideal, which he consciously cultivated:  the heroic explorer who takes great risks for the sake of discovery and national glory.  With his remarkable physical stamina and literary gifts, he created a legend for himself that his ambitious widow spent a lifetime advancing.<br />On the other hand, there is a consummate professional explorer, Amundsen, who decided at age 15 that he would master Arctic travel and live the life of a discover.  Amundsen systematically learned how Eskimos lived, from their primitive technology (perfectly adapted to the polar climate) to their languages, and apprenticed to the greatest arctic explorer of the age (Nansen).  He was also a shrewd and natural leader, able to lead a &#34;happy ship&#34; without rigid hierarchy of command.  It is a case study in highly capable management of a monomaniac, and as we should all know, he succeeds (I give nothing away here).  This book explains why in wonderful detail.<br /><br />The reader really comes to feel that he knows these men by the end of the book.  At every step, we witness a subtle psychology emerge.  Genius though he might have been, Amundsen made plenty of mistakes and lived a lonely and unhappy life, much like a general who spends years, or even decades, planning a decisive victory that is decided in only a few hours of combat and then feels hollow.  Scott, for all his disorganization and petty egotism, was better with the media and more in sych with the expectations of his times, which explains why his story of a noble failure eclipsed that of Amundsen for so long.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.

To my amazement, I have not tired one bit of this series and simply couldn't stop reading this one.<br />In this volume, the author concentrates on Caesar's action and military techniques and they are indeed fascinating. For example, in the siege of Alesia, Caesar faced threats from within the citadel and from far vaster forces without, at his flank.  SO he built a kind of defensive/offensive plankway - a ring around the citadel that could be attacked and defended from both sides and starved the occupants out while holding off hostile reinforcements.  This was totally new in military history, as McCUllough explians in vivid detail and action.  Though I have never been one to enjoy military history, I found myself cheering for Caesar and in awe of his creativity.<br />Much less is devoted in this volume to who Caesar was and why he did what he did, which were explored in the earlier volumes. Nonetheless, the personalities of his assistants - the cruel Labienus, the indolent yet growing Anthony (and his huge crotch) and at least a score of others - come through in great detail and with remarkable historical accuracy. The reader is treated to how Caesar managed them all. THe counterpoint of this volume is Pompey the Great, whose flaws and pretentions are magnified with age. While I was less convinced by this portrait, it is still very interesting. FInally, the portrait of the Gauls (and their brash leader Vercingetorix) is very well drawn and informative, as is the portrayal of the young Cleopatra struggling to maintain herself on the throne.<br />As I have said before, the measure of success for me is that I want to go back to the classical sources to learn more. Warmly recommended, both for the action and for the learning about vanished worlds.	2002-12-02

You have Sulla, who has suddenly become very ill and aged, in the ascendant; his soul sickness comes to full flower here with his power, which he wields with the most chilling ruthlessness as he attempts to return Rome to an earlier age. Then, there is the young Julius Caesar, whose star is just beginning to rise and whose character is utterly unique and fascinating. (There is an hilarious episode where he is captured by pirates, whom he seduces with his wit while telling them he will return and crucify them, which he subsequently does.) The narrative shuttles between the two rather disjointedly, in a time of change as the Roman Republic breathes its last.<br />Despite this disjointedness, I enjoyed this novel as much as I did the previous ones. Indeed, I was enthralled as I experienced the history of Rome, which I have studied my entire adult life, in a new way. This is one of the best series of historical novels I have ever read and I can't wait to read the next ones in the series.<br />I believe that McCullough achieves her ambition of making as complete a portrait of an age as can be done in fiction.

This is more important, the author asserts, than trying to resolve the issues that are discussed, debated, and argued about. In other words, he argues that it is far more important to be nice, to avoid being defensive or sarcastic, to avoid stonewalling and the like.<br />While this may well be an important insight and may predict the prospects of couples facing divorce, I believe that the issues matter in marriages and thus that this advice only gets a couple in trouble part way there. THere are also exercises, in which couples can check their cognitive styles and try to adjust them.<br />REcommended with these limits in mind.	2002-11-26

THis is the episode of Caesar's career that he spent mostly intriguing in Rome: it is about how politics were run then, who the personalities were, and all the ways in which he enjoyed and used women. It is a matter of taste, but I enjoyed it as much as the earlier volumes. While the author goes a bit too much in the everyday detail at times, this is an absolutely superb place to learn about ancient Rome in the twilight of the Republic.<br />Caesar is the sun around which all the characters orbit as he takes the reigns of power into his hands to do things that no one imagined possible. It is a portrait of genius, at times a bit too superhuman, but then he is unequalled in so many ways by anyone in the modern world. He has not yet made his greatest military conquests, but is positioning himself, which is a political struggle against a bizarre spectrum of natural enemies.<br />The portrait of roman society also gains wonderful detail, in particular the role of religion in everyday affairs. Caesar becomes a priest, but as a source of power and as a way to stabilize his finances, which are perpetually in disarray. There are some hilarious episodes with the Vestal Virgins, forced circumcisions, and arcane battle between members of aristocratic families. Also, McCulough does not shy from giving an iconoclastic interpretation of Cicero as a vacillating and cowardly prig, however brilliant his self-aggrandising writings were; he in many ways is the most interesting character of this volume.<br />Warmly recommended as among the best historical novels you can find and certainly one of the most distinguished series ever written about Rome.  McCullogh has again done her homework and you can tell it is a work of love.	2002-10-31

He came recommended as a truly unique voice, with the additional interest of being a Turk steeped in the mores and traditions of his country and yet able to view them with some satirical distance.<br />SO I was very happy to discover this volume and was not disappointed.  It is a first-rate historical novel set in the Ottoman Empire during the beginning of the Enlightenment in Europe.  Without giving away any secrets, the plot follows a young Venetian university graduate who is enslaved and given to a Turkish savant, who wishes to learn from him as much as he can.  From the most horrible humiliations and labor, the young Venetian rises to the top of Ottoman society, all the time battling to maintain an identity independent from his owner.<br />The historical details are fascinating and often very funny.  The reader witnesses the limits of proto-science in a more of less Medieval Islamic culture, which is viewed as half magic but also as full of potential power.  Then there is the Ottoman court, in which the slave and his owner become key players through guile and some scientific accomplishments, in particular during the plague.  The intrigues are full of tension and mystery, a world glimpsed but not wholly explained in a perfect balance of novelistic art.<br />Finally, there is the inter-play between slave and owner, a conflict that is brutal and terrifying and yet a rare treat for the reader.  The psychology of this conflict, I found, is extremely profound and realistic, showing the effect that each had on the other as the years passed.  It is also full of surprises.<br />Highest recommendation.	2002-10-29

This book had the pretention of covering 3000 years of human thought in 400 pages.  I found the plot rather dull and full of unabashedly two-dimensional characters (mere props to the supposesd discourse that was going on) and the coverage of philosophy so standard and without character that it felt like I was reading &quot;cliff notes.&quot;<br />Coverage of anything that I knew well was a disappointment.  The one chapter on the Middle ages covers 1000 years and barely even mentions the achievements of scholasticism, which arguably became a pillar as important to modern science as Kepler's discoveries.  OK, you can't cover everything, but that points to the deepest flaw in this book:  it is far too ambitious.  As such, this is a book for yuppies who want to feel like they are learning something and being significant by reading about an entire epoch in a half an hour.<br />Not recommended.	2002-10-23

Groves, the Manhattan Project's Indispensable Man	Books	3	22	26	N	Y	good, dry scholarship	This biography fills a significant gap in the historical record:  behind the incredible scientific and engineering triumph of the Manhattan Project, there was a master administrator.  Leslie Groves is that administrator, the take-charge guy who knew how to inspire, find competent people to whom he delegated tasks, cajole and bully his way into the historical achievement of the first working atomic bomb.  In this bio, you get to know who he was, how he operated, and what he did.  There is no doubt he was a great and talented, if somewhat unsung, man.<br />Nonetheless, Groves' life and methods are not exactly something that would inspire a lay reader about the epoch.  There are far better books for that, such as Rhodes' Making of the Atomic Bomb, which is the most readable and best reported and researched of the whole shelf of books on the subject in my opinion.  No, this is a book of value principally for specialists in scientific and military history and for atom-bomb buffs.  There was info I needed in it and could only find there, so it was most useful for a scholarly purpose.  But it was not a fun read about a rich time.<br />Afterall, when contrasted to great politicians or scientists or adventurers, there is a reason why very, very few bureaucrats find a narrative niche:  they are simply not as interesting or as comprehensible.  Norris even says as much, when he admits there were not many layers to Grove:  he was a competent and arrogant man, who when given extraordinary authority during the war was capable of achieving extraordinary things.  At the end of the war, he refused to change along with the army and instead retired to a corporate position and as a curmugeon who corrected in excruciating detail the innumerable accounts that kept appearing.<br />I do not mean to diminish Norris' achievement here, only to put it into perspective for prospective readers.  The prose is clear, if a bit lackluster.  But this is very good scholarship and a useful addition.<br />Recommended for specialists only.br />Recommended for specialists only.	2002-10-06

At the core of the book are the three scientists - Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, and  Edward Teller - who had the greatest impact, both from the technical problems they confronted and from the political points of view they advocated. Though a bit rarified in terms of general interest as it focuses on science advisors, this for me was a fascinating recounting of the decisions that led to the arms race and eventually cost $5.5 trillion and produced 120,000 nuclear weapons.  It also evokes with great eloquence the domestic repercussions of the cold war and paranoia of the 1950s.<br />Herken writes well, though at times his style was strange for me.  For example, one person evaluated a speech with a \\"gimlet eye.\\"  (I had to look that up.)  Nonetheless, Herken's writing is dramatic and fast paced, far far better than I would normally expect from an American academic.<br />Recommended with enthusiasm.	2002-09-27

I enjoyed reading it and it went very swiftly, but I was left unsatisfied with both the level of detail and the author's lack of interest in delving below the surface. Indeed, I would have wanted a book at least twice as dense.<br />That being said, the facts of the Medici family are competently covered, from their rise with Cosimo the great banker to their dying out several centuries later in the most squalid and humorous decadence. From rich behind the scenes wielders of power, we watch their fortunes rise and fall until they become petty autocrats in the time of Louis XIV. THese facts were interesting and the writing is competent if unoriginal.<br />Alas, the author does not ask any probing questions and shows little ability to stimulate further inquiry. He barely mentions what constituted the Renaissance, let alone asked what might have caused it, etc. We also get no real insight into why the Medicis behaved in the manner that they did - what their characters and motivations were - and the historical forces they reflected. THis is appalingly superficial.<br />Take this book with you if you are going to Florence and want to know who those Medici people are in the paintings, but go for something else if you want to understand one of the greatest flowerings of human knowledge and artistic creativity since the fall of the ROman Empire.	2002-09-23

I say obtuse because the formal political action takes place for the most part off-stage. Instead, we are treated to an hilarious novel of the manners of the ruling class, as defined by wealth and pedigree. The protagonists discuss the great decisions being made - which led directly to American involvement in the World Wars and later Vietnam - almost inadvertently, as when they are cutting a wedding cake, and purely in reference to their own careers and selfish aspirations.<br />The main characters are extremely good. There is McKinley (a political master about whom I knew virtually nothing and hence learned a good deal), Teddy Roosevelt (a buffoon in Vidal's hands who is also a political juggernaut), WR Hearst (a devourer of anything he desires and self-appointed \\"creator\\" of history), and John Hay (Lincoln's secretary, TR's secretary of state, and an imperialist). There are also the fictional Sanford half-brother and -sister, who appear in his other American novels, who are very funny as they struggle ruthlessly against eachother for the family fortune as well as for the same man. The peccadilloes of finely drawn characters were the stuff that made empires fall and created war, in particular in the Philippines. There are also the Vanderbilts, the Whitneys, and many other giants from the Gilded Age. Finally, Henry James has two brief appearances and goes into long monologues that read exactly like his stuffy prose.<br />In addition to the theme of the rise of the modern media with Hearst's active creation of news - perhaps literally provoking the war with Spain by manufacturing a crisis to sell newspapers - the reader is treated to the technological changes that are going on as a backdrop (electricity and horseless carriages). It is marvelously evocative, particularly as it occurred at the beginning of the last century and inspired a sense of wonder, which is the greatest achievement an historical novel can aspire to.<br />Because he grew up in this milieu (his Grandfather, as one of the first appointed Senators from the new state of Oklahoma, makes a sly cameo appearance) Vidal is most convincing as he dissects the casual vanity of people in power: they are just going into the family business of politics, to which they feel entitled, and are apparently not filled with the ideals that we were taught in school, or so Vidal would have us believe. As a subtle and wholly jaundiced take on America, his is a truly original comic voice and the prose is as luminous as ever. While I disagreed with a lot of it, I laughed at least once on every page and I felt like learning more about most of the characters. That to me is another sign of the novel's success. Nonetheless, now that I have read almost all of the series, I am beginning to tire of Vidal's cynicism. There is something so relentless, even facile, about it that it makes me wonder if Vidal is playing with the reader or if the deficiency of vision is in fact his and not the subjects' he chooses to accuse of hypocrisy and demagogy.<br />Warmly recommended.eless carriages).

And only true political junkies will love it.  I loved it:  it is hands down the greatest political biography that I have ever read.<br />Though I disliked the second volume as too one-sided, in this one Caro returns to the full moral complexity of LBJ in this volume.  I now see the unity of the entire work, as LBJ positions himself to gain power and yet has some genuine progressive desires to improve the lot of the disadvantaged; the second volume were his \\"wilderness years\\" and I will re-read it with that in mind.  While LBJ`s ideals were always in thrall to his ambition, when the former could serve the latter, he did great things and that is what is covered in the 3rd volume.  You really get a sense of how complex men of power are - they can be good and bad at the same time - rather than a caricature or bloodless representative of \\"historical forces.\\"  It is amazing (and inspiring) that an independent work of such magnificent scholarship can be produced outside of academia.<br />The story in this volume is also extremely rich thematically:  you get a history of the Senate, a bird's eye view of the arcane power hidden in its \\"rules,\\" and of course, the great de-blocking of the civil rights reform that had been stalled for nearly 80 years.  There are also a number of fascinating sub-themes, such as LBJ's shameful pioneering of McCarthyite tactics to destroy the career of bureaucrat Leland Olds in the service of Texas oil interests or the depths of depression to which he could fall when his ambitions appeared thwarted or the career of Sen. Richard Russell (he was a racist and yet a man of principle and honor).  But at the center of it all is his genius to take a position that no one wanted and turn it into a new source of power, which he did as Senate majority leader:  it had been, for over a century, a position that brought ridicule on those who tried to exercise power on the unruly collection of individuals we call senators.  In doing so, LBJ fundamentally changed the way that the modern senate functioned, reintroducing discipline through the creation of effective incentives and threats that no one was able to muster before him.  That is genius and Caro explains how.<br />If there are some problems with the book, the majority of them come from Caro's own political biases:  he takes as a given that anything liberal is \\"good.\\"  Moreover, as critics repeat endlessly, because Caro embarked on a vast enterprise with his multi-volume biography (and it will probably take him more than 45 years to complete it), his interest in LBJ verges on obsession and he appears at times as too superhuman to believe.  The book at 1,000 pages is also too long:  I lugged it around on vacation and occasionally tired of the endless stream of examples and detail as the binding began to rip in transit.  Indeed, there are several full books in this volume.<br />Though I have studied politics for over 25 years, there were many, many things that I have learned from Caro's opus and I eagerly await the final volume in the series.  Caro writes with such elegance, clarity, and drama that I am in awe of his literary talents, even if he sometimes goes too far.  This is a masterpiece whose depth is similar to that of the great writers of the past, such as Gibbon or Thucydides.

You have Sulla, who has suddenly become very ill and aged, in the ascendant; his soul sickness comes to full flower here with his power, which he wields with the most chilling rughtlessness as he attempts to return Rome to an earlier age.  Then, there is the young Julius Caesar, whose star is just beginning to rise and whose character is utterly unique and fascinating.  (There is an hilarious episode where he is captured by pirates, whom he seduces with his wit while telling them he will return and crucify them.)  The narrative shuttles between the two rather disjointedly, in a time a change as the Roman Republic breathes its last.<br />Despite this disjointedness, I enjoyed this novel as much as I did the previous ones.  Indeed, I was enthralled as I experienced the history of Rome, which I have studied my entire adult life, in a new way.  This is one of the best series of historical novels I have ever read and I can't wait to read the next ones in the series.<br />I believe that McCullough achieves her ambition of making as complete a portrait of an age as can be done in fiction.

What is so very interesting about it, in addition to Yourcenar's incomparably clear style and mastery of historical detail, is the sense of wonder the reader gains as this man leaves Holland as a stowaway, learns the sailing trade, survives a shipwreck to live in an obscure colony on the N American coast, and then returns to Europe to die young.  The story flows without much pattern or reflection, which is very unlike the author's other historical novels, and the narrator did not become a person I cared about very much.  This testifies to her range and the complexity of characters within her:  she is a first-rate writer.	2002-09-08

I think that it's main problem is that it is a popular science writer who is trying to say something original as well. While I by no means wish to disparage gifted amateurs from pursuing their own investigations, that kind of formula tends to work better when the writer first and foremost a specialist, on the caliber of SJ Gould, which White clearly is not.<br />White's contention, in concentrating on Leonardo's investigations, is that he was in fact acting as a scientist, perhaps the first modern one:  using direct experiment to test theories that he was formulating.  While Leonardo was certainly doing this, it all depends on how you define science.  If it is experimentation to validate and change your mathematical theories, OK.  But if you mean participating in a community that shares a larger theoretical foundation and then communicating your results for a kind of peer review, which Kepler and Galileo did, Leonardo most definitely was not a modern scientist:  he kept his notebooks to himself and feared plagarism almost paranoically.<br />Unfortuantely, White leaves the definition unclear and so turns his book into a strange kind of anacronistic exercise.  If you focus on the work on others, you can argue that many were &quot;the first modern scientists.&quot;  Some hundreds of years before Leonardo, the builders of gothic cathedrals appear to have had geometric concepts (math), which they carved into massive stone by trail and error (experiment), and they also had an overarching highly logical intellectual system, scholasticism, that was adaptive and very rich.  Why not argue that they were the first real scientists?<br />Moreover, it is not even clear that White wants to systematically argue that Leonardo was &quot;first,&quot; but merely that he was a pioneer.  Does it even make sense to argue such a thing?  What does it really add?  We all know he was a genius who was largely self-educated and hence did not share the aristotelian assumptions inherent in scholasticism.  But Leonardo was not systematic:  with the exception of his great anatomical studies, he jotted thing down most things privately and in code, so you really have to interpret a lot of things heavily to find meaning in them.<br />Nonetheless, this was the first bio I read of Leonardo and it was quite interesting.  Indeed, it gave me an appetite to seek  more on him, though I would go for his art and engineering in the next go.  It covers many of the standard details adequately and is written clearly, even beautifully.  When the author speculates, which I think he does far too often, he at least makes it clear that that is what he is doing.<br />Recommended as a starting point.mptions inherent in scholasticism.

After seeing at least five versions of this tale in film - one of my great childhood monster loves - I was happy to finally read the novel. As so often occurs with classics, I was as surprised as I was fascinated.<br />For starters, the characters are far more subtle than any of the film versions: Victor F appears as a brooding and obsessed genius, but also as a great lover of life and nature. The monster, who is an articulate and literate creature who read Goethe, is even more interesting, from his hopeful beginning to his bitter reaction at rejection and his thirst for vengence. His eloquence was vivid and his pain horribly realistic.<br />But the work is also fascinating as a window into the mind of the Romantics, who at once strove to reject the rationalism of the Enlightenment yet reflected it. The creature starts off empty and what it becomes is due entirely to his experience. Knowledge is not always good, etc.<br />Finally, the themes are timeless and full of conflict: creativity giving birth to unimaginable destruction, tampering with nature as its necessities overwhelm even genius, and the like. THe book is a kaleidescope of philosophical reflection. The pain of the creator and the monster alike are inescapably linked like father and son.<br />I did find the style of the book a bit difficult. It is full of florid rhetoric and lengthy circumlocutions, as the doctor and then the monster tell their stories in almost identical prose.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-07-09

There are two strong women at the center of it:  a German immigrant and her daughter-in-law, whom the former's do-nothing, Marxist son abandoned with two young grandchildren.  The reader follows all of their fates over a period of about 40 years, from war-torn London to a fictional developing country near S Africa.  It is vivid and moves very swiftly.<br /><br />The characters are extremely well developed and exist in a kind of static balance even as they change and grow:  there is always at least one angry and presumptuous taker, one giving and loving soul who is saving someone, one person healing and ready to move into a do-gooder role themselves.  Etc. When one leaves the nest, another seems to take her place in rapid succession, and most of them tend to return as if to their own families.  The balance of personalities is well thought out and realistic.<br /><br />What distinguishes this novel from those that are similar is that, rather than romanticizing the characters in some two-dimensional way, Lessing is simply relentless in showing their shortcomings and limitations.  Fate does not deal kindly with any of the characters, though some (not necessarily the nice ones) do better than others; the evil ones rarely get theirs, though they lead rather sad lives, and the good ones must struggle very hard just to tread water.<br /><br />Lessing is also very hard on all the ideologies that are floating through the plot:  she goes after communists, hippies, feminists, the internationalist development elite, journalists, and even Third World leaders.  In other words, there are no simple answers; instead, the questions just get tougher.  While there is a lot of humor in this, it is very dense, a kind of reverse history of idealism, showcasing the self-serving egotism that underlies the motives of virtually all the characters.  What is amazing is how well it succeeds in bringing these ideas to life through the characters, though I found the second half of the book, much of which takes place in Africa, less strong than the first half.<br /><br />Finally, the people are all extremely English.  This means that there are many levels to read the book on, with subtexts implied rather than stated outright.  Far more tedious than that is the patience of those suffering or being taken advantage of:  I wondered what martyr complex led them to tolerate real jerks who turned around and betrayed them in horrendously destructive, cruel, and selfish ways.  (I would have kicked them out without a thought, but then I am only married to a Brit and far less tolerant than she.)  That is the only tedious bit in this truly fine novel.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.rs.

The book is peopled with exremely vivid characters, almost all striving to honor their family in the records that survive.  To Westerners, the view into an alien and vanished worled is as fascinating as it is surprising.  THere are sons who were honored as having true &quot;filial piety&quot; because every day for years they licked the pus out of their mother's wounded knee; the difficult father who ruined the family with gambling and sloth - a typical selfish &quot;Asian man&quot; - only to spur his son to greater effort; the local official who spent a huge part of the family fortune to build a splendid garden for the emperor to see as he passed their home once.<br />Nonetheless, this history gets a bit lugubrious with detail, particularly personal.

It looks at the multi-culturalism wars in the US, sprinkles in some ineresting examples, and then ends.  I don't mean to be glib, as I respect the author and love his writing style and erudition, but that is all that it meant to me.  I can not even remember clearly what his opinion was on multi-culturalism, and I just read it!  The book just kind of rambles and I never understood why the author chose to write about the details that he did.

On one level, you witness every step in her career, from her luck at having a great teacher while her father worked in Tietsen China to her greatest triumphs with Rudolf Nureyev in the 1960s.  She is gracious, humorful, and in awe of her craft and art.  She treats the reader to a wonderful portrayal of her method of creativity:  what she thinks about and feels, the regime of her discipline, and the institutions she became a part of.  This is valuable stuff.<br />On another level, the reader is introduced to a vanished milieau of artists in Europe and the US, which is personal history at its best.  While the politics of the 20C were viewed from the sidelines here, it was fascinating to me to learn what it did to the arts.  There is also Arias, the love of her life, a Panamanian aristocrat who had a strange and dry sense of humor.<br />Warmly recommended for those who love dance history.	2002-07-03

He covers their art a bit but without enthusiasm and instead seems to target their personal foibles and sexual peccadillos, which were many and indeed strange.  This is valid reporting and ceratinly covers a necessary part of the story, but after a while it gets boring. However, in many sections the author speculates in strange ways on details of their intimate life that cannot be known, such as positiing that the origin of O'Keeffe's \\"discreet lesbianism\\" came from cryptically documented (hence essentially unprovable) sexual molestation as a child. If you want to look at the art, you have to go elsewhere.  I enjoyed this as a vacation book but did not learn much from it beyond gossip.	2002-06-29

It is about how a family deals with growing old and growing up, with all the tics of suburban despair, marriage wars, failed careers, and confused sexuality. In other words, it is a modern and realistic novel written in the broad-brush approaches of Balzac and Tolstoy; individuals as well as the broader society are portrayed.<br />WHile I have met people who disliked all the book's protagonists as they made bad decisions and hurt a lot inside, I liked virtually all of them. They are painfully believable and sad in their isolation, which the omniscent narrator presents in a wonderful, shifting perspective that moves backwards and forwards in time and comes to rest on crucial moments of consequence and change.<br />I think that many readers from similar backgrounds will find a lot of themselves in this book and will empathise with the characters. They also grow and evolve in realistic ways through the course of the novel, as their roles shift within the family equilibrium. There are also many funny scenes, however bitter sweet, that can be read on many levels.<br />In terms of my personal preferences, I was happy to observe that this novel does not get into the dreamy \\"surrealism lite\\" that many popular American novelists indulge in to excess, such as Don Delillo.  It is very realistic throughout, even if some of it appears exagerated at times.<br />It is also beautifully written, indeed superbly. In addition, while dealing with a lot of sex, the author masterfully treads the fine line of description and titillation without ever venturing into pure pornography. I found that refreshing.<br />THere are flaws in the book. SOme of the descriptions, as critics noted, are strangely clinical or scientific. There are too many incidents packed into detailed scenes, which can overburden the plot while seeking to advance it.<br />Nonetheless, this novel is achingly close to being truly first rate and I can only anticipate better novels from this talented writer in the future.<br />Warmly recommended.this talented writer in the future.<br />Warmly recommended.	2002-06-28

What is surprising about it is how mundane it seemed to them:  you kill a guy and then have some more pasta.  It is truly frightening in that way.<br />It was fun also to compare it with Scorcese's great film of the same title, which is faithfully mirrored.  The one thing I did not like about the book is the way it was written, like a dialogue of gossipy long-islanders reminising about their childhoods.<br />REcommended.	2002-06-21

Julius Caesar is also a child prodigy in it and the familiar cast of characters from the first volume are back as well.  As far as new characters go, there are the brutal \\"oriental\\" despot Mithradates, Ciciero, and the ambitious Pompey family.  They are all believable and very interesting as well as embodiments of possible roman futures in a way that most history books do not explore.  The characters also evolve, which adds a depth that makes it all the more believable.<br />It is about a very sad era in Rome, with the republican institutions in precipitous decline as powerful generals rise, whose troops are more loyal to them than to the Roman Republic.  The descent into barbarism is horrific and brilliantly delineated by McCullough, who has done a superb job of historical research.  Just as Marius' star is waning - and his decline from the great and far-thinking man he was makes for depressing reading - so Sulla's time has arrived.<br />I do not know of a better way to live in a different era than historical novels.  This series is so masterly, so fascinating in detail, and so fast-moving in plot and action that it is one of the best that I have ever read.  Warmly recommended.	2002-06-19

Many of the reviews of this book here objected to the fact that the narrator is, well, self-important, verbose, presumptuous, and pretentious.  While she may be all of these things, she is a very consistent and believable character, a budding academic trying to understand (and yes, label) the world in her hyper-intellectual way as she moves up from the working class.  Anyone who has spent time on a college campus knows the type, and you either enjoy them or you don't.  I found her very attractive and fun, though not someone I would ever want to become involved with, at least seriously.<br />Through this overly analytic character, we are introduced to life in a exotic backwater, Botswana,  where she is trying to advance her stalled dissertation as well as find some romance.  I found entry into that world fascinating and enticing, something that I will now never do though may have wanted to in the past.  The plot centers on her entry into an experimental community that a brilliant (white) man helped to create and is managing, where women have a larger role than is usual in African societies and where decisions are discussed in a democratic way.  While I have no idea if it is based on a real experience, it really has a lot of insight to offer into life in under-developed Africa.  As superficial as it sounds, it helped me to imagine what was going on in the minds of many in villages I visited in S Africa on a recent project.  I wanted to learn more, which is one of my tests for a good reading experience.<br />The portrait of this community is very dense, subtle, and multi-layered, as much a critique of development specialists and the bubble they live in as a satirical look at professional intellectuals:  the authors are poking fun at her and at academia, rather than espousing her views and recondite perceptions.  Yes, there is a nerdy twit inside the narrator as well (and she is aware of it and revels in it, too).  I found this very funny and laughed a lot as I read it.  Robertson Davies does very similar things and the reader is not supposed to take what he says at face value; what the author writes in not necessarily his point of view.<br />The love story at the center is also very moving, at least for me, if again over analyzed and verbalized to excess.  It describes in wonderful detail the euphoria of the discovery of someone to love, in this case a younger woman with an older man.  Again, I enjoyed it immensely and found it realistic:  we have all been there (hopefully) and it is played out with wonderfully quirky characters.  As the cover said, it is about love at its apogee.  This is the only area in which I thought the author was not constantly poking fun.  It is beautiful.<br />So I would warmly recommend this book, but it is a question of taste.it.

This is one of those books I would recommend.  Instead of overflowing with ridiculously florid rhetoric about recycled banalities and excitement that is simply not justified, this book is based on solid research and is not afraid to offer un-spectacular advice.<br />It is about what the authors call \\"visionary companies,\\" which stand for something beyond just making money and yet are profitable.  They do well, and they do good.  There is no doubt that such companies exist, which I admit in spite of my boredom and cynicism regarding most of the businessmen and \\"business intellectuals\\" that I deal with as a writer.<br />Set up like an academic study, the book is a synthesis of the authors' findings while taking a long historical view of consistently excellent (i.e. \\"visionary\\") companies like H-P, Merck, and P&amp;G.<br />Not surprisingly, these companies do similar things:  1) they have visions and value that they try to uphold consistently throughout the company and to which they stay true over decades; 2) the set incredibly ambitious (and in retrospect realistic) goals that inspire their employees (&quot;big hairy ambitious goals&quot;); 3) they are cult-like in their beliefs in themselves; 4) they allow for trial and error, which lead to \\"evolutionary progress\\"; 5) they hire leadership from within; 6) they cultivate keeping their employees a bit off-balance (\\"uncomfortable\\") as a way of getting them to perform at their best; 7) they make sure that all elements work in concert and are internally consistent and self-reinforcing (&quot;alignment&quot;).<br />That is it for the ideas, which are far more nuanced than the above paragraph.  They could be summarized in one chapter, and the rest of the book is repetition and analysis by example.  The examples are interesting and informative and the ideas, which have all been said before, are good to review in a systematic way.  Very good.<br />These are good and useful ideas, if somewhat banal.  But then, doing business is rather dull for the most part - there are very few exciting companies out there, but most of them are like horribly dysfunctional families.  This is the authors' bid to explain the good few.<br />The tone of the book is rather modest, but the authors do get a bit too wordy and chummy in many instances.

It is doubly remarkable in that it was published in the decade prior to the Soviet seizure of power, which imposed decades of political terror in Russia as we know, and in that France was a well-known member of the left.  Thus, academics rightfully proclaim it as a symbol of the horrors to follow in the 20C.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this book very much.  Not only is its tone self-important with ponderous and ever-present references to classical mythology - the myth of Orestes as well as the bacchantes - but its innumerable references to obscure figures of the French Revolution, in all their historical accuracy, make it, well, just plain boring.  Moreover, the characters appear more like symbols of abstract ideas than flesh-and-blood creatures, and so are both unrealistic psychologically as well as put in situations in which they can carry out long and improbably philosophic discussions.<br /><br />The plot follows the impoverished members of an apartment building during a time of grave threat to the revolution.  There is a fervent young man (a painter and revolutionary fanatic), his missing sister (shacked up with an aristocrat), his simple mother, and an older cynic atheist (an ex-courtier and libertine), who gives refuge to a persecuted priest and innocent peasant girl.  As the revolution takes an increasingly murderous turn, they become ever more intimately involved with each other as vehicles to portray historical events.<br /><br />As such, the book seems to be written for the French high school student, all of whom memorize survey literature from secondary sources to pass rigorous examinations.  This makes them able to spout facts as if they had read widely, implying depth and thoughtfulness that all too often isn't there.  Of course, France obviously has great depth and his historical research is indeed exhaustive, which taught me a great deal.  But the book just didn't make me feel like I was there, which was why I read it.  Instead, while reading I felt like I was studying for a high school exam.<br /><br />As I try to get through the classic authors, I am occasionally surprised at the banality and dullness of some of the most famous works.  Perhaps this is because I read them from a rather na've perspective, open and as if they are not revered for whatever, but just as a pure reading experience.  Thus, my perceptions are personal and limited to my own experience.

According to Halberstam, not only were there new (untested, i.e. risky) technologies available  precision bombs and the B-2 stealth aircraft that could quickly take out the infrastructure with virtually no collateral civilian damage  but there was a new crop of remarkable young leaders who were willing, indeed who felt personally compelled, to take the task on and were not allowed to do so.  Furthermore, the author claims, there was a crusty layer of (often mediocre) leadership below Bush and Clinton, who were wary of entering a new Vietnam (or Somalia), throwing up political barriers and misleading them as to Americas strengths.<br />I was astonished at Halberstams descriptions of the technological advances that had taken place and how Pentagon doctrine had tended to lag far behind:  we can, he says,  now deliver powerful explosive devices within a few feet (!) of their targets, a gain in accuracy over earlier bombs that surpasses several orders of magnitude.  After many doubts and false claims, apparently we are entering the era of smart bombs and Halberstam dissects the debates they engender at the top levels of the military.  This is very powerful stuff and will change our lives.<br />According to Halberstam, the younger leaders, in particular the diplomat Richard Holbrooke and the army commander Wes Clark, had unusual skills and phenomenal brainpower.  They were interesting and very difficult characters  Holbrooke an arrogant, pushy type with too many enemies and Clarke your prototypical Rhodes Scholar super-preppie   who in the end were able to accomplish a great deal, though only after the political fallout of the disaster had become so great that Clinton finally recognized the necessity of action.  As they pursued their policies, both of them set fundamentally important precedents:  Holbrooke helped to expand the role of the US beyond the Weinberger doctrine, according to which only vital threats to the US alone called for serious diplomatico-military commitments; he also negotiated the Dayton accords and helped to bring Milosevic down after the Kosovo bombing destroyed his political base in Serbia.  Under extremely challenging political pressures, Halberstam writes, Clarkes operation was a turning point in the history of warfare, that is, a victory with airpower alone, which ranks with the introduction of tank warfare as a revolution in military strategy.  Clarke and Holbrooke changed forever the way the US could wage war as well as demonstrated what types of diplomacy were possible.<br />As Halberstam points out a bit pedantically, lessons would include:  lack of clear leadership can hinder talented teams from coming together.  Not only are goals undefined, but people cannot gain the mandate and clout to oppose the hidebound bureaucrats who failed to recognize radically changed conditions in the Post Cold War era.  However, Halberstam relates, once Clinton paid attention and accepted the risks involved as unavoidable, Holbrooke, Clarke and others were allowed to do their thing with extraordinary results.  After it was all over, the author notes, bitter Pentagon bureaucrats took their revenge on Clark, getting him fired by subterfuge and ending a remarkable career prematurely.  Halberstam goes into fascinating detail on the politics and clashing cultures of the US military and civilian leaders, both of whom regard eachother warily for many legitimate reasons.<br />Halberstam also goes into great detail about the situations in Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Haiti.  While I had seen the breakup of Yugoslavia as inevitable and full of such deep hatreds that none of the actors came out clean, Halberstam argues that the Serbians were indeed the worst aggressors and needed to be stopped before perpetrating the worst genocide in Europe since WWII.  Here, the reader is treated to the depth of his moral qualms as well as his penetrating questions about what America should do with its preeminent power.  This is not a simple repeat of his Vietnam questions on the inevitability of local revolution, but a far more mature look at a different world, in which the US is the undisputed superpower yet reluctant to use its might.  It leaves readers with many questions to resolve on their own, which is one of the most fruitful things that a great political book can accomplish.<br />One of the marvels of Halberstams reporting talent is that the reader sees policymakers and warriors as real people who are making decisions as best they can and within the limits of their education and outlook.  It is too easy for us to ignore that there are many possible courses of action and many ways that things can turn out.  As a close reader of the political scene, Halberstams view is consistently trustworthy in my opinion.  He seems to me to have a perfect pitch regarding politics, at least in the many areas I followed closely:  I found myself agreeing with his slant on things and hence believing him when he reported on the things I knew less about. It is an ideal book to start a debate rather than the simplistic ideological diatribes that we have come to expect from the so-called pundits.  While this book does not develop the narrative momentum and eloquence that Best and the Brightest does, the author still sets the highest standard for political reporting, an example to which all writers should aspire.

Suddenly there were memoires, fiction, more realistic painted portraits (capturing real character and not just stylized), and sturdier surviving architecture, all of which offer a far more accurate picture of the times than was available during the dark ages.  Piecing all of this together is utterly fascinating, as the reader is treated to detailed analyses of the costumes, customs, eating habits, and concerns that are reflected in them.  You can get a wonderful idea about the texture of everyday life, though more from the standpoint of aristocrats than more common people.<br />Unfortunately, due to the overall goal of the writing on private life, the reasons behind these bigger changes are scarcely mentioned and hence little analyzed. While my disappointment of this reflects my own ignorance of the history of the period, it might also serve as a warning to non-specialists who want to know more.  THe only chapter I found dull was a very very long one on the common themes of literary sources.<br />That being said, the book covers written sources, archaeology, and art extremely well:  they seem to have been converging on the emergence of the \\"individual\\" that occurred just prior to the Renaissance.  It is an amazingly interesting story.  Indeed,  there are so many strands in all of this that I found myself in awe of a period of history that I heretofore saw as far more uniform, as a precursor to the modern era or a disappointing sequel to the astonishing unity and sophistication of the classical era.<br />Recommended.	2002-05-20

He is full of hatred and suppressed violence and, in my view, wholly unsympathetic.

It is a dazzling side glance into the cultural evolution of these tumultuous times with some reference to the larger political context.<br />The distinctions between these cultures are at once subtle and brutal.  First, we view the civitas of Rome, that is, the obligation that Roman citizens felt towards their cities, which involved complex community-oriented mores and expensive public displays that were paid for by private means; aristocratic children, brought up with relatively less sense of their individuality than we enjoy, saw their lives and careers as reflections of the glory of their cities.  The reader is also treated to the way that slaves and families were treated in great detail.<br />Then, in the early Christian era, more privatized cultures arose, first with the increased introspection that the christianization of the empire entailed.  Next, the barbarian invasions - in which nomadic tribes smashed the urban cultures in whose wealth they had wanted to partake - merely accelerated this trend; they greatly valued their possessions, often war booty that they had to carry with them, and hence had little regard for fixed property and its supporting laws that enabled cities to flourish.  Infrastructure and larger communities and political units in this period deteriorated, which severely impacted trade and hence economic welfare.  The standard of measure of a life at that time became purely personal wealth and power.<br />A sub-theme of the book is the influence of monasticism, which created its own closed communities and became the model for family life at the beginning of the gothic era.  Monks and the clergy were the holders of standards of conduct and literacy through this little-known period, and exerted immense influence on the mores of the people who lived nearby.  In all its detail, this was new to me.  Indeed, if it were not for their labors, much of classical learning would have been lost forever.  They are also virtually the only source for information about life in Byzantium.<br />While there is something lost in having so many authors involved in a single volume, the chapters in this book are so long and detailed that they are like self-contained books.  Ample illustrations transport the reader to each era, revealing the mystery of what made us who we are in the west over so many centuries.  Nonetheless, the chapters are uneven.  The chapter on Roman architecture in N. Africa is very boring indeed, and the one on Byzantium is dull as well.  But those on pagan and then Christian Rome are superb, as are those on the dark ages.<br />Finally, this book relies more on written sources than on archaeology, which is a pity in my opinion, as the sources written after pagan Rome are rather formulaic and outright boring in their rhetorical flourishes as you read about them over hundreds of pages.  At times, it reads like a compendium of obscure sources, including exhaustive analysis of funery inscriptions, though that is often what academia comes down to.  Another odd thing is that there are only two pages of footnotes, which are followed by a rather poor bibliography.  While the book is trying to strike a balance between popular and specialized audiences, I would have preferred better info on sources.<br />In spite of these criticisms, there is no question that this book is an ample and fascinating meal.

Either way, the reporting in most of them is bad and conforms more to the ideology of the reporter than to any reality.

It is a design and engineering company in Palo Alto, CA with offices worldwide, that designed the first mouse for Apple as well as an array of products that are working their way into the consumer mainstream (e.g. heart pacemakers, thick-handled toothbrushes, and the Aerobie football).  From Kelley's telling of it, the place is full of creative individuals, healthy competition, and zaniness:  with virtually no hierarchy or bureaucracy, they sit around playing and brainstorming and joking, coming up with innovations in great flashes of insight and lots of hard work.  To put it mildly, I was skeptical:  it sounded like many of the places that mediocre reporters extol as the \\"future\\" of innovative companies with ridiculous regularity and that are merely booster science fiction, complete with its own vocabulary (\\"Think verbs, not nouns\\").  When I went to the company for a writing project, I expected to find the ugly underbelly that went little reported, the \\"reality\\" that was typically hidden from all but those who worked there.  Instead, I was delighted to find that I was being too cynical:  I witnessed an organization that blended talent, discipline, and fun in its own unique way, the secrets of which Kelley attempts to pass on in \\"The Art of Innovation.\\"<br />There are far too many nuggets of wisdom to summarize here.  Regarding traditional marketing, for example, Kelley (and co-author Littman, who has a wonderful, clear writing style) argues that \\"observation-fueled insights\\" - both personal and via tests - will lead to more innovation than merely asking consumers what they like and want.  This is, in my opinion, a fascinating insight that requires far more thought than the reader may imagine.  All too often, market professionals take at face value what consumers say, rather than questioning whether they are trying to please the interviewer or don't really know their preferences.  The key, Kelley asserts, is to anticipate their desires.  He also shares the Ideo experience on the \\"perfect brainstorm\\" - and I watched them in awe myself - as they think outside the normal barriers of out thought.  But there are many, many other subjects, such as their ideas on the control of personal space in the organization.<br />Nonetheless, in spite of their inspiration and irrepressible enthusiasm, Ideo engineers are not dreamers.  They are down to earth businessmen and they know the limits of how far they can go in search of the \\"next big thing.\\"  Kelley continually warms the reader not to get carried away, not to become unmoored from deep-seated consumer preferences:  as he puts it, \\"color outside the lines, but...stay on the same page.\\"  While a hit product combinesgood design and cost-efficiency, he warns, they also need good timing, which is extremely difficult to predict:  you need some luck as well.  In other words, there is substantial risk in what they do, and they fail often.  Interestingly, Ideo employees are allowed to fail so long as they learn thereby to stay at the cutting edge or to take their idea and apply it in some new way in another product.<br />While most business books peter out long before the end - some do not even merit getting beyond the book flap - this book just kept getting better for me.  The concluding chapters were just as interesting as the earlier ones, making new points and offering sound advice rather than merely recapitulating some banality.  For example, at the very end, Kelley talks about one way that Ideo employees try to see the future:  rather than seek to pull something out of thin air, they attempt to find \\"early adopters\\" of cutting-edge technologies that are not yet well known (or \\"distributed\\").  This is a subtle insight that I will study in the years to come.  Indeed, this book seemed better to me on the second reading, which virtually never occurs, at least for me, in the business book genre.<br />Recommended with enthusiasm.es good design and cost-efficiency, he warns, they also need good timing, which is extremely difficult to predict:  you need some luck as well.

I found this book on my shelf and gobbled it up in one sitting.<br />It is the story of Djilas' family in Montenegro, from before the 1st World War until after the revolution that brought Tito to power.  It is truly brilliant autobio and also give great insights into the passions that Tito's death helped to unleash in the region.<br />First, Djilas' family was a kind of local gentry, with leadership responsibilities as well as blood debts to pay.  As a child, Djilis had to worry for his father's life, which was threatened by retribution.  It is hard to imagine how a grade-school kid survived that psychologically whole and in the end was the one to end the cycle of revenge-feuds.  He brings these anxieties to life in chilling detail.<br />Second, there are the destructive impulses - pathologies, really - that infected everything in Baakan life.  This included his father's shame in the memory that he was called on to participate in the massacre of a peaceful muslim village nearby, which is horrifically described, as well as the long discussions with his would-be killers who staked out his house at night.  You will really feel them when you read this.<br />Third, there is the death of Montenegro's independence as a nation, which forms the backdrop to the book.  It demonstrates how shaky the foundation of the nation was and how little Tito did to help overcome these divisions in spite of his caudillo-like rule over almost 40 years.<br />What emerges in this book is how truly great a writer Djilas was, one of the best European writers of the 20C in my opinion.  I could not read it in the original, but the translation is simply wonderful.  SO many phrases combine wisdom and elegant succinctness, such as:  \\"the story of a family is the story of a land.\\"  While he might have been a bit self-serving - he was a dissident who started out as Tito's propaganda minister - Djilas portrays himself as a tolerant humanist and democrat in this book.  His voice will be missed as one of reason for that troubled region.<br />Highest recommendation.

Graham was, of course, one of the great innovators of an entirely new genre of artistic expression, modern dance, and she is very open about her constant struggles and triumphs.  She is a true American original.<br />In this book, you meet St-Denis, Eric Hawkins, and Merce Cunningham, and manz others, all of whom were influences on her and whom she influenced.  They are fascinatingly placed in both personal and historical context.<br />While the content of this book is exceptional and extremely valuable, it is oddly structured, kind of a series of vignettes that are not even broken down into chapters.  This was disconcerting to me and it made the thread of her narrative hard to follow at times.  It was edited by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, opne of her last books.<br />I recommend it to those already interested, but not to those who are not deeply hooked on dance.

You enter a world that is alien and yet so very familiar.  It fills you with wonder and the desire to return to that world and learn more.<br />While I am a bit of a snob when it comes to writing, I was told by so many people that this was a truly excellent novel by none other than the author of The Thorn Birds, which I scorned (without reading it) as cheap melodrama.  So I got it and was not only not disappointed but utterly enthralled from page one.  This is superb and masterful fiction, well researched and full of page-turning action and intrigue.<br />The story takes place in the sunset of Republican Rome, starting in 110 BC, with military threats to Rome in N. Africa (Jugurtha) and from the German hordes to the North (Boiorix).  The main characters include Gaius Marius - a military genius who has seen his public career stalled due to his lack of patrician birth status  - and Lucius Sulla, a poor and debauched aristocrat who will stop at nothing to advance himself.  These men form an alliance that is as complex and multifaceted as it is effective.  Marius' opponents are the good-boy Patriciate, who are for the most part hidebound aristocrat mediocrities undeserving of their birth right to their share in the power of Rome.  But there is also the hilarous Patrician opponent Scaurus, who loathes Marius as much as he loves him and needs his military genius.  Other Characters include Julius Caesar's parents, grand parents, and a host of politicians whose personalities are subtle and beautifully drawn.  This is not melodrama but wonderful storytelling.<br />If you want to know what it was like to live then, this novel will really open that world to you.  The Republic was a democratic experiment - deeply flawed, but with regular and peaceful transfer of power to an ever wider group - that lasted 500 years!  As I walked around Rome recently, I delighted to think about what happened in the places I was walking by, which I learned about from this book.  You get to know the fashionable rich, the declining old families, and the riff-raff of the Subura, where murderers, freedmen, Jews, and actor-prostitutes made their homes together.  You witness the great military campaigns of the time, and follow Sulla as he \\"became\\" a Gaul in order to gather intelligence on Rome's most dangerous enemy yet, each with descriptions of the places that became well known towns such as Caracsone, Toulouse, and Verona.  There is also the cruelty and superstition, which perfectly offsets the iconoclastic and progressive personality of the great (and arrogant) Marius.  It is wonderful and fun and as far as I can tell - as an old college classics major - historically accurate.<br />I give this four stars only because it did not quite pass the bar of true literature for me, as do the great Yourcenar and the consistently excellent Gore Vidal as first-rate historical novelists.  But that does not detract one bit from my enjoyment of the novel.  I will read the rest of the series, for sure.<br />Warmly recommended.was walking by, which I learned about from this book.

It gives details of the ship, keeping its purpose a mystery and developing the personalities in depressingly predictable ways.<br />It is not bad, but it simply fails to meet the mark of Clarke's solo works, which means either that his powers are failing or the co-author is doing the work.<br />If you are a purist and serious sci-fi fan, don't bother with this.  But if you are looking for a pretty good read that continues a story without surprises, this is OK.  But it is only OK.<br />I was profoundly disappointed with this, as with all of Clarke's sequels (with the exception of 2010 Space Od.)  It is simply an insipid logical extension and you feel contantly that the author(s) are groping to extend it in an interesting way.  I wish they didn't write this.

Leonard Bernstein (for music), Stephen Sondheim  (for lyrics) and Jerome Robbins (dance and direction) formed the nucleus, but there were also a playwrite, and other specialists and actors who all collaborated.  The principals took a substantial risk in their budding careers and forged ahead confident of their inventiveness.  The result is Broadway history, which opened the way to treating a myriad of other socially relevant subjects in later years.  Though the music is what is remembered best now, it is truly a multi-media event that was pioneering in its time.<br />I read this because I am writing teaching materials for business execs to study, as a case of effective, if unorthodox, management.  That is only one of the many many levels n which it can be read.  The author offers a wonderful panorama of the dance, music, and acting that was current - and changed by this musical tradegy - at the time.<br />It appears that Garebian used only written sources to write this.  As many of the participants were alive at least during the lat decade, this limits the account in unfortunate ways.  But is it well written and a spur to read more elsewhere.<br />If you are interested, I would recommend this.  If not, go to the biographies of the participants.

THese cities, he argues persuasively, pushed commercial and financial capitalism to new heights, that is, with a combination of banking and control of trade routes, they created monopolies that benefitted themselves largely at the expense of their trading partners.  They did so with a combination of readily mobilisable financial capital, clever warehousing (particularly in Amsterdam, which was like a perpetual market fair) that allowed them to control supplies and hence sell items at the right time for the higest price, domination of shipbuilding technologies as well as naval prowess (i.e. state piracy), and the control of the origin of their supplies, as in the Dutch East Indies for the spice trade.  Braudel argues that it was a conscious policy.  He also deliniates how Spain and then Portugal were beaten.<br />He then moves on to the birth of industrial capitalism in England in the late 18th C, which the loss of the American colonies - and hence ended its military obligations there while trade increased - facilitated.  The great difference here, which he argues is a creative extension of the other long-existing forms of capitalism rather than its true beginning as many claim - was that investment was made in new technologies.  It is similar to what the U.S. and Japan have done as major economic powers with different industrial systems:  the U.S. had the largest national market, while Japan created cartels that could control prices (going after market share rather than immediate profit).<br />Braudel also examines basic questions of how an economy is successfully ?revolutionised.?  What makes inventions take off in one society and not another?  Is it one factor, or many acting together in concert?  In particular, he compares the cases of the newly de-colonised United States and Latin American, in which the former was able to place itself at the center of the world economy and compete while the latter were weak and hence consigned to a subordinate role by the superpower of the day, Great Britain.  He also examines the case of France, which was never able to enter the first rank of commercial and industrial nations prior to the 20C because, he argues, Paris (an administrative and not a trade capital) dominated the country and never learned to respect entrepreneurs.<br />These arguments are truly fascinating and presented with the perfect amount of detail:  not too much as is often the case with Simon Schama, and not so little that only specialists can understand it.  While it is sometimes difficult to follow his thread of logic, there is so much to learn from this book that I will consult it for the rest of my professional life.  As a measure of its interest, I kept a marker in the footnotes, where I loved to look for references on virtually every page.<br />Nonetheless, as a 2000-page book that I loved, I am glad that it is done!  It took me nearly two years to get through it all and I wished at times that it was more succinct.  I found myself fliiping through it to see where illustrations would shorten the text.

Perhaps it had to be written by a woman, who was regarded as the sexual property of a horrible man.<br />The story of how she escapes and frustrates her \\"owner\\" is indeed enthralling, a triumph of human will in the worst adversity.  She hid under the slanted roof of her mothers house for years, permanently injuring her back and watching he children grow up from afar.  It is such a moving story that I imagined turning it into a play, with the narrator reminising of her life while hidden in that cramped space.<br />As this is a memoire, the characters in it are very very real, all too human and without the black-and-white quality of too many novels on this bizarre twist of American history.  While the writing style is so superb that it had to have been edited by an expert writer, the story and voice are so vivid that it must be real.<br />I have given this book to literally dozens of friends, and almost to a one they have marvelled at the depth of the story.  This is the best and most complete account of an aberration in American history of which we all must bear some sense of responsibilty.<br />Get this:  it cannot disappoint.	2002-02-19

It is the closest thing to a tour of hell that the 20C could provide.<br />The story centers around a sensitive and intelligent child, who was left in the hands of a caretaker in the countryside during WWII.  When the caretaker dies suddenly, the child is left to fend for himself in the Polish countryside, where the population is superstitious and poverty stricken.  He lived through a succession of horrors, including beatings, exposure to sex, and threats to his life.  He survives, of course, and makes extremely interesting observations with the clarity - and peculiar warp - of a child.  He also becomes as cruel as his tormentors, but still reachable and able to grow.  It is a glimpse of what that war was like.<br />This makes Painted Bird a brilliant novel, undoubtedly Kozinski's best though also his first.  It is a tradegy that Kosinski lied about his past, perhaps to market the book and also to create a myth about himself, saying that this was autobiographical when in fact he had spent the war in relative comfort with his parents.  When the truth became known, he committed suicide.  But that does not diminish the magnitude of his acheivement here.	2002-02-05

This is the place to find it.<br />The interesting thing is that Lucien is not the principal player here:  it is an equally mysterious mentor, whose identity and methods are revealed as the plot thickens.  Another character is the \\"harlot\\" from the title in English, which misconstrues the character of the novel. She is Esther, who is Lucien's true love, whom he uplifts from prostitution to install as his secret mistress.  There is also Nucingen, the Jewish banker whom Balzac despises (from the novel of the same name), and several wily spies.<br />I must say that, though I love Balzac, this novel wore a bit thin on me:  it has too many unlikely coincidences and is crowned with a cynicism in the surprise ending that stretched way beyond what I could believe, even when taking into account the French judicial system. That being said, Balzac offers a wonderful tour of the underbelly of the life of the scheming courtesan:  without revealing too much of the plot, having given up on art, Lucien is trying to enter the aristocracy as a diplomat with the rank of Marquise.  But to do so, he had to marry the right woman, buy his ancestral grounds,  and somehow pose as a dandy when he is in fact flat broke.  One pole of the plot revolves around the maneuvering of his mentor, who proves himself exceptionally cunning, the other around Lucien's true love.  Needless to say, there are betrayals, hidden enemies, and ruthless manipulations that destroy oh-so-many lives.  In the end, it is mostly sad, except for...well, you have to read it to believe it!  The view of the aristocracy in this one is rather oblique as they play behind the scenes, while I expected them to play center stage.<br />If there is one thing to sum up Balzac, it could be this: there is one chapter entitled, \\"boring chapter to explain four years of happiness\\" in which Lucien in love is portrayed.  When I told my wife that it was winding down, she replied:  \\"don't you mean it is grinding down?\\"<br />As usual, you need a strong stomach for this one.  I got bored by the middle, at the height of all the unbearably sleazy maneuvering, but the last 200 pages really picked up the pace.  To wit:  I enjoyed the characters hurtling toward destruction in this one, which is usually the opposite:  I prefer their hopes and hate their falls, except in the case of Lucien.happiness\\" in which Lucien in love is portrayed.

Now he has a co-author, whom I suspect does most of the work, and then tries to sell these knock-offs by the power of his name.  In the process, he does much to ruin the original concepts.<br />This books brings Rama back, with the promise of explaining what was left the most pregnant mysery at the end of the first book.  He did the same with the Space Odyssey series, though those eforts are far better because there is more of his mind in them.  This book is not without merit:  there are good characters in it, idealism is matched by an equally powerful cynicism, and the story is relatively fun.  But there is no question that it lacks the spirit of the first tome.  The mission goes awry this time, with interesting consequences and some potential for the later books.<br />Get it only if you can bear disappintment and yet must see where they will take it.	2002-01-21

This is indispuably one of the best of Balzac's novels, with clearly drawn characters and grim lives in an inexorable descent to self-destruction, which are the classic Balzac themes.  It explores the life of a libertine as he ruins  himself and his family for the sake of pursuing pretty girls.  Unbekonst to him, he gets help from Bette, a cousin full of secret hatreds and bent on vengence.  It is very sad to read.  One minor character even commits suicide by repeatedly smashing his head into a nail, his only means to finish himself off he could find in his jail cell.<br />So why read it?  Well, again, it is for the wider social portraits that you can find, which are offered almost as an aside.  Balzac in one section explains the politics behind the statues you see all over Paris, which is fascinating.  You also learn of the career of courtisans, as they use their sex to advance themselves.  The book is simply full of these thngs, in addition to the psychology of the many interesting main characters.<br />Also unusual for Balzac is the coherency of the story, which does not degenerate into ramblings like many of his other novels as they weave the tapestry of his Comedie Humaine like so many threads, that is, as vehicles in his vast project to fully portray an entire society with characters re-appearing in different situations and venues throughout his interrelated novels.  The characters stand on their own here and are more clearly drawn.

It is about the building of one of the great American businesses of the 20C, but also much much more:  it is about the conflict of an extraordinarily hard-driving father and his talented though psychologically burdened and rebellious son.  From the beginning, they were at eachothers' throats and never relented in their conflict, even when it became evident that the son's genius surpassed that of his father to build an empire that can only be compared to the accomplishments of the first two Caesars, Julius and Augustus.  The book also covers a good deal of American business history from the great depression to the beginning of the stagnation of the 1970s and early 1980s.  Thus, it can be read on numerous levels.<br />There are so many insights in it that it will bear re-reading for a long time to come.  Watson Jr. was acutely  aware of the cost of success and was brutally honest about his own failings as a manager and family man.  I find myself remembering scenes in that book, running them in my mind as examples from which to learn.<br />Warmly recommended.	2002-01-08

Books	3	5	6	N	N	Useful, if (in appearence) banal and silly	We are in the age of manufactured enthusiasm.  How anyone can imagine that regular work in a business should be stimulating to the point of being really really cool is simply beyond me.  Yet year in and year out, Tom Peters (and an immense cohort of lesser talents) continue to tell us that yes, work can be fun and cool, etc etc.  And he continues to make the really really big bucks doing so.<br />Either Peters is onto something, or we are all fools for treating him like he is.  What I believe is that he has inserted himself into business speak as one of our principal formulators of vocabulary to dress up our normal drudgery as something more than it is.<br />Peters pumps businessmen up, flatters their vanities, and sends them back to the real work with a new vocabulary of \\"change agents,\\" \\"WoW projects,\\" and innumerable other expressions of similar banality.  He tells them that what they are doing is significant and interesting, and that they can make every project into a fantiastical thing that will change the workd as well as enhance their careers.  This boggles the mind, particularly if you have read it more than once in such puffed up venues as Fast Company and Wired, which I believe bring the the profession of journalism to the crudest boosterism, akin to the promoters of primitive Western cities in the 19C America.<br />In Project 50, Peters offers \\"fifty ways to transform every `task' into a project that matters.\\"  They range from \\"reframing\\" the task as it was posed (make it revolutionary) to selling it succinctly (\\"metaphor time!\\") to implementing it (\\"celebrate failure\\"!! as a learning experince and as a useful exercise of thinking \\"crazy\\") to Exiting (\\"Seed your freaks into the mainstream\\"!).  If this does not want to make you vomit, try reading it straight through.  Doesn't it make you cringe?<br />And yet.<br />In my education work with managers whom I sincerely admire and who are undoubtedly highly intelligent and savvy, they gobble this stuff up and use it.  While they disdain much of the ridiulous in Peters' vocabulary (the \\"nub\\", etc.), they find it profitable to discuss these ideas and it inspires them to change.  Thus, I must conclude that there is something is all this hype, something useful that gets pulled out and applied.  I just wish that it didn't seem so trivial and silly, so over the top for people who consider themselves writers.  I saw a group of extremely bright people wave this book like it was Mao's Red Book durin the cultural revolution.  It was stupefying.<br />So I must say:  this book is useful.  I make money from it too.  And it changes behavior, at least in the activities that I have seen as an education professional.  Thus, I must recommend it with a grain of salt.  Don't get carried away, but don't have too closed a mind either.and use it.

While the voice is a bit off-putting, addressing the boy as &quot;you&quot; and then referring to everyone else in the third person, I got into the characters and the scene in great depth.<br />This is a chronicle of several failed attempts to leave a backward and xenophobic village, for a huge ghetto near Johannesburg.  It is painful to read, but very very rewarding and an accurate reflection of the crisis in S Africa today, where the entire society seems to be breaking down in violence, Aids, promiscuity, and rape.  According to my friends here, it is chillingly real and felt so to me.<br />Warmly recommended.	2001-12-03

This is one of the finest novels of the 19C. It chronicles the relentless rise - and inevitable, brutal fall - of a talented and highly ambitious young man during the French restoration. You witness Julian, from his abusive childhood at a sawmill, as he gains the position of a tutor with the local gentry on the strength of his having memorised the entire Vulgate Bible, into the highest ranks of the aristocracy. All around him, there are characters in equal parts fascinating and pathetic, perhaps more interesting than he and yet eventually his victims.<br />The protagonist Julian is at times cold, calculating, shrewd, a fool, and very sad, desperately in need of love. But he is always realistic psychologically and cunning, if lucky and then very unlucky. Julian bursts all of the limits imposed on him and in the process indicts the society from which he sprung and gained. This is utterly spellbinding fiction, into which you can go as deeply as you wish, from simple emotional reactions and an exploration of a rigid society, to structuralist symbolism if that is your bag.  I started reading this in a bout of insomnia and continued, rivetted and repelled, through the entire night.<br />Highest recommendation.	2001-12-03

That is about 1/4 of the population.  By that time, 30% of all children under 15 will be orphans!<br />This book looks at the shape of the epidemic, the causes of its spread in Southern Africa at an unprecedented rate, and possible solutions.  The subject is so alarming and bleak that it is impossible to exagerate.  While it goes a bit too easy on the government's and Pres. Mbeki's personal responsibility in an attempt to avoid controversy, it hits hard nonetheless.<br />I will use this book as essential background in my current writing project.  While I may have wanted a bit more scientific and historical detail at times, this book strikes a superb balance between popularisation, accurate reporting, and a call to arms.  It should serve as a model to the genre.<br />HIV/Aids will kill a huge proportion of the global human populaton over the next 25 years, and will be looked upon as the holocost of the 21st C.  While treatment regimes exist, they are proving inadequate and too costly to halt the disease's spread at this time.  Books like this one are urgently needed.	2001-12-03

The adventure is a crew that goes on board, not knowing what they will find.  What distinguishes this novel, in addition to the slowly unfolding exploration inside the massive space craft, is that the purpose of the craft remains a tantalizing mystery.  This whet the appetite of my imagination as few scifi novels have ever done, leaving a puzzle that the reader can fit together and manipulate in countless ways.  Indeed, for a while in my insomnia, I imagined things about the creators to help me drift off to sleep.<br />Because Clarke strives for such realism, he refrains from making his books into comic-book silly swashbucklers.  I believe that this is why some readers find them unsatisfying.  But if  you are into hardscifi, this is the truly, truly best that you can find.  It places a seed in the imagination that can last a lifetime, the mark of a classic.	2001-11-17

As such, it heaps banality upon banality in the stuffiest and most pretentious pseudo-English intellectual style.  I believe that this is the product of a truly mediocre mind, isolated from the academic mainstream to such an extent that he is unaware that he has NOTHING new to say. His main point is that institutions and politics influence the business environment.  DUH. It would be funny if it weren't pathetic.  In addition, his writing style is neither elegant nor fluid, but flat and dull.

Arising from a family ravaged by alcoholism and abuse, the great beauty Nana becomes a celebrity in theatre and then as the mistress of the high aristocracy and bourgeous.  At her core, she is a devourer, empty of anything but the will to suck whatever she can out of anyone who comes near.  She ruins the fortunes of numerous men with frivolous demands for things she barely wants, and Zola in the process illuminates how they made their careers and were ruined by their appeites for this woman, who becomes an archetypal destuctive force.  It is indeed a bleak and severe indictment of an entire society:  you learn how celebrity worked in it, from the bottom up and back down again.  Her sexuality is omnivorous, the men her willing victims for a mention in the Figaro gossip columns.  (As Zola put, \\"les hommes suivent une chienne qui n'est pas en chaleur.\\")<br />Zola makes for fascinating reading, as does Balzac, for the wider tableau he paints.  The writers are similar, except that Zola was a far more careful writer.  Unfortunately, it is often difficult to find any characters you can like or admire, which makes the cynicism and condamnations overbearing and hard to get through at times.  There are numerous inventions in it that became classic, like \\"blond venus\\" and \\"golden fly\\".  This adds to it as a glorious classic novel.<br />In a wider sense, this is one of the central novels in Zola's cycle on the \\"natural history\\" of an extended family, the Rougon-Macquart.  It is based on a crude kind of Darwinist sociology, a kind of reasoning that was in its infancy when he wrote and which later culminated in Freud and Durkheim.  THat is another level that is quite fascinating, a philosophical cycle of novels mixing biological science and Schopenauer, all deeply pessimistic and determinist.<br />Recommended, but it takes perserverence and a strong stomach to finish it.	2001-11-17

Ever since I heard these stories as a child, I have peridoically enjoyed re-reading them as an adult.<br />This book, I thought, would be another simple retelling of the stories.  Well, I was wrong:  this book is for adults, with its own sense of wonder at the complexity of the classical world's religion and leisure activites.  Calasso mixes the stories with archeology, art criticism, and psychology in what I believe is unique literary experiment.  Even for adults who did not become imbued with these stories early on can enjoy this book and perhaps see what childhood initiates treasure.  That makes it a unique gift book for the thinking adult.<br />It is also fun and easy to read, a lovely tableau painted by a great master.  The descriptions are brilliant and vivid, totally believable as well.  REcommended.	2001-11-12

His books are so finely written, so superby researched, and so subtle and dramatic that he set the standard for the best who were to follow.<br />Childhood's end is probably the best of his earlier books.  Clarke maintains a sense of mystery until the very end, titillating the reader with clues.<br />Without revealing the plot, humankind is visited by enigmatic space craft, perched over the major cities of the planet.  The aliens will not allow themselves to be seen and they let mankind develop more or less as it pleases, though subtly guiding it and rarely overtly.  While reading it, you feel the vastness of the universe and the wonder of existence, which sounds pretentious but Clarke pulls it off.  He also weaves in certain grand themes, such as the unity of apocalyptic visions in the major religions, the complexity of time, and the destiny of the human mind, all of which are inter-linked.  This creates a permanent space in the imagination of the reader, to be nutured for a lifetime.<br />Recommended as a great introduction to the world of sci-fi.	2001-11-10

Its history is peopled by individuals who went on to become great by any world measure:  not only did Mahatma Gandhi pioneer his methods of non-violent protest there, but Winston Churchill first distinguished himself for his leadership qualities during the Anglo-Boer War.  Then there was Nelson Mandela, a man who emerged from over 25 years as a political prisoner without bitterness and ready to help a divided society begin to heal.  And there are scores of others, including the ruthless Cecil Rhodes and dynamic chiefs whose struggel to maintain their culture and independence was doomed. Of course, S Africa set a series of horrible precedents as well:  the refinement of civilian concentration camps at the turn of the century, institutionalised racism, and the heartless exploitation of captive ethnic groups.<br />Unfortunately, instead of telling these tales with drama and flair, this book gets bogged down in laborious descriptions of the recommendations of obscure commmissions, tallying election results, and the complete details of discriminatory wage policies.  Alas, reading this offers about as much pleasure as wading through a Webster College Dictionary page by page.  How can academics turn something so fascinating into a sludge of seemingly disconnected facts?  In the rate moments when I felt my interest rising on a particular topic, the authors abrupty dropped it in the middle and fail to follow it up.<br />Moreover, though it purports to be a modern and updated history, this book stops at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (yes, it gets boring treatment as well) and barely even addresses the twin crises that threaten to rip this fragile new society apart:  escalating random violence and the threat of Aids, which may kill 25% of the population or more in the next ten years.  Can S Africa continue even to exist?  Was all the struggle for naught?  If you are interested in these questions, you have to look somewhere else, I'm afraid.

Its portraits are sharp and unlike any that I have ever read, leavened with enormous subtlety and humor.  This makes it a truly unique read.<br />Interestingly, not a whole lot happens in this autobio outside of personal growth, ambition, and his father overcoming alcoholism.  Instead, the author muses over a rich life that started with an average family.  There are deep relationships and a great deal of love, ruminations over the racism and sensitivity of his southern upbringing, and the outlines of his concerns with art.  It is a bit annoying that he plays the pronoun game with those he loved:  obviously, they were either men or men and women, so why not say it?<br />If you like a measured and calm set of vivid recollections by an individual of great literary talent, you enjoy this very much.

Asimov participated in American science fiction's golden age, helping to convert pulp fantasy stories into realistic predictions of the future based on current science. It isremarkable that he wrote the Foundation while a young man, barely 20 I believe, a work  with grand themes and the cornerstone of his massive and sprawling future history of mankind, which I believe went into more than 50 volumes. The basic plot is that a scientists created a new discipline, psycho-statistics I believe,  that could predict the future behavior of huge masses of humans. He then attempts to<br />mold - or at least influence - man's fate over the next 30,000 years. What is truly amazing is that Asimov succeeds in this and the two following volumes. In a way, he should have stopped here with the series. The ideas are crisp and not yoked into a determined framework, so are fresh with lively characters. Later novels in the series - the overwhelming majority - feel more stilted, bound by concepts more than by a plain old good story.<br />A sci fi classic.	2001-10-30

It is a les full portriat than the first volume, which portrayed Johnson in his full moral complexity.  This volume is at time so black and white - contrasting a bad LBJ to a &quot;good&quot; Coke Stevens - that I worry Caro is losing his touch.  Caro is a brilliant writer, one of the best political historians we have.  While I am critical here, there is certainly much he uncovered as the great reporter we trust, such as LBJ's do-nothing period during WWII, that others missed; as such, this is still first-rate and compprehensive, even if the interpretation is oddly skewed.  I hope that the following volumes will make up for the gaping flaws in this one.<br />Recommended with caution.	2001-10-30

It is a tough, well-reasoned manifesto for the anti-consumerism left of \\"Gen X.\\" If you are wondering what was driving many of those protesters at the WTO and other summit meetings - most notoriously Seattle in late 1999 - then this book is the best place I know.  It is part cultural critique, part economics and social policy, and partly a call to arms. Reading it has helped me to make sense of so much that I thought was simple, nihilistic anarchism.  I was humbled to learn that there is far far more behind the movement than I had granted it.<br />In a nutshell, Klein argues that the \\"superbrands\\" - the huge corporations such as Disney and Nike -  are progressively taking over virtually all \\"public spaces,\\" including school curricula, neighborhoods, and all-encompassing infotainment malls like Virgin Megastores.  THey are doing this in an attempt enter our minds as consumers in the most intimate ways, which Klein and others find unbearably intrusive.  Moreover, she argues, as they subcontract overseas, the superbrands are leaving first-world workers behind while they exploit those in the developing world under horible conditions.  It all adds up, she asserts, into a kind of emerging global worker solidarity that is developing new means (via  internet exposes, protest campaigns, etc.) to push the superbrands to adopt more just policies and practices.<br />What was so amazing and useful for me, as a business writer looking at the same issues, is that Klein so often hones in on the underside of what I think are good and effective business practices:  the development of brand values, globalisation of the production/value chain to lower prices, and the like.  Often I may disagree with her take on things, but she makes too many insightful points to dismiss her and those whom she speaks for.  I came to genuinely respect her as a thinker and writer.<br />Nonetheless, there were numerous omissions, some of which I must point out.  First, while condemning exploitive labor practices in third-world sweat shops (which I do not deny exist), Klein fails to explore what the available alternatives are for these workers.  Well, I went to Pakistan  to examine one of the cases she addresses - children soccerball sewers - and I can say that their alternatives were all too often brick kilns or leather tanneries, both of which were far more dangerous and beyond the reach of international activists because the superbrands have nothing to do with them.  Second, Klein tended to dismiss the efforts of MNCs out of hand, as weak sops designed more for PR purposes than to effect change.  This is true for some groups, but again, while in Vietnam, I witnessed what I regarded as real social progress that came from the actions of a superbrand:  upon hearing the demands and suggestions of a worker-safety inspector paid by adidas, Taiwanese sewing-machine manufacturers were approaching him for detailed design specifications to enhance their safety (driver-belt covers to protect against hand and hair injuries) and he had lots more ideas.  However modest, that is real and concrete progress in my opinion.<br />Moreover, I believe that many of Klein's assertions are inaccurate or unproven.  Is there really a mass movement growing out there?  Is the clever defacing of huge advertisement boards really impacting pubic consciousness? Does everyone perceive the thrust of the brands as intrusive and poisonous? Is the World Trade Organization set up in a way that works in favor of the first world and against the third world?  These are complex and very difficult questions.  Finally, as a passionate activist, Klein rhetoric can get a bit overheated.  At one point she says that IBM \\"otherwise impaled itself\\"; at another that Milton Friedman is a \\"architect of the global corporate takeover.\\"  What do these things mean?  I may regard Friedman as a laughable free-market fundamentalist, but he is only a cloistered academic idoelogue, not a doer of any kind.  Does throwing a cream pie in his face do anything more than shock adults?<br />In spite of these reservations, I can only applaud Klein for stirring up the pot of these issues, which provoke thought and encourage exploration, even by conservatives like me.rd Friedman as a laughable free-market fundamentalist, but he is only a cloistered academic idoelogue, not a doer of any kind.

This one is perhaps even better - certainly more mature - than How to Save Your Life.  I still think that for a hilarious and yet sad reflection of the pre-Aids 1970s and early 1980s, Jong is simply our best novelist.  The psychology, the needs, the pain, and the ironies are so realistically and touchingly rendered that I found myself completely believing in the character.  It is a first-rate effort and a pity that it is out of print.<br />While this is yet another novel about divorce and the search for both perfect love and always-spectacular sex, the protagonist has grown into a kind of world weariness along with her concerns on how to bring up her daughter.  While she is still willing to experiment with guacomole in the nether regions, it is about entering middle age, with the baggage that so many of us carry, and yet keeping one's idealism and hope alive.  The passages on her ex-husband are divinely insightful and comic, from his inability to become independent of powerful parents (and how that hinders his own creative development); I still chuckle about her exmother-in-law - in her quip \\"at least she's s nice girl\\" - \\"demolishing\\" both her son's new girlfriend and his ex-wife in one sentence.  (Isadora \\"marvelled\\" at her effiecincy.)<br />Highest recommendation.	2001-10-17

The author is very very hard on them, while respecting what they contribute.  Then there are the political economists, who believe that history and the functioning of institutions need to be taken into account for a full and accurate picture.<br />This really put things in perspective for me in a clearer way than I knew, and I have been writing about economics for years.  The Gilpins demonstrate why economists need to transcend the basic algebra and esoteric game theory models that obsess them.<br />On the other hand, being a survey means that there is not great depth in the book.  Just when things are getting interesting, the author abruptly moves on to another subject, leaving me frustrated and wanting more, much more in the case of the issues I am currently researching.  Moreover, the coverage of the footnotes is uneven, leaving me wondering what sources the author used.  Gilpin's view, if I read it correctly, is that of a moderate conservative believing in free trade while attempting to take into account the complexity of the issues, such as the failure of the LDCs to develop.<br />Moreover, the Gilpins prove once again that American academics are rarely good writers.  The prose bristles with repetitions and leaden, if clear, writing style.  It made the book a chore to read at times, however useful the content.<br />Nonetheless, this is a useful book, written at the high undergraduate level.  Recommended.	2001-10-11

It was conceived as a modest work of sociology on certain types of tranistion in science - those in the physical or hard sciences - and yet Kuhns conclusions have been taken as a metaphor by everyone from literary theorists to New Age devotees into heavy-duty moral and social relativism.  It is a great example how ideas can escape the control of their originators.<br />Kuhns book is OK, but it is a rather pedestrian read.  He wanted to look at how scientists behaved in the face of new ideas and observations that better described the underlying reality - the truth, if you will - of their fields.  It was intended to be strictly limited to the more provable sciences, which could be tested against predictions.  As far as his intentions went, it is a modest success.  If you want to get into the New-Agey philosophical ramifications, you need to go to less rigorous thinkers such as Foucault and his many copiers or Fritof Kapra.  You will not find them in Kuhns book, which I suspect would surprise many people who talk about him.<br />In fact, the scientists I know dont think much of Kuhns book:  they see it as contributing to the post-moedernist argument that science is simply and exclusively a social contruct; they argue that they are going after far deeper truths - true descriptions of reality be they mathematical or the historical categorisations of the darwininists.  They despise the talk of paradigm shifting, which they believe is built into the scientific pursuit already. I suppose that they are right, though I also believe there is no question that Kuhn succeeded in capturing how they think and act in many circumstances, that is, the old school often needs to die off so that new ideas can gain the status of orthodoxy that in turn will fall one day.<br />I would not recommend this book to the casual reader.

It will (and should) frighten us all into action, and given recent events of Sept 11 and its aftermath - the imminent threat of terrorism that may be biological in nature -  this book is extremely well timed.<br />The thesis of the book is that, for a variety of reasons (lack of political will in the US, economic deterioration in the former USSR, and poverty in Africa) public health infrastructures worldwide are in serious decline at the moment that horrible new diseases (Aids, ebola) and new strains of old ones (TB, whooping cough, diphtheria etc) are emerging.  If these public health infrastructures are not repaired, she asserts, we are in for horrendous trouble.  She may well be right and for this reason, we would do well to heed her plea for renewed investment throughout the world in preventive medicine, epidemiology, and other measures to promote collective, as opposed to the privatized (or \\"medicalised\\") health model.<br />It is easy to dismiss this argument as crypto-socialist,but to do so is a disservice both to the talents of Ms. Garrett and to the idea of public health itself.  To prove her case, Garrett embarks on an historical tour of the public health systems of both the US and the USSR, both of which were pioneers.  The US, in New York but also in Minnesota, developed science-based systems to recognize dangerous contagious agents and to stamp them out via quarantine and later vaccinations and for bacteria, antibiotic treatments.  The statistics speak for themselves and are well documented in Garrett's book.  Not surprisingly, the USSR developed a more coercive and less scientific system, which was in decline before the fall of communism in 1990; since then, it has declined so alarmingly that death rates in the former Soviet republics are twice as high as births!<br />What is needed, she says, is larger investments to maintain the fragile infrastructures of scientists, other health care professionals, and access facilities.<br />The wider landscape she describes - the context of this deterioration - is bleaker and more terrifying than I had imagined possible. It involves antibiotic-resistent strains of tuberculosis and other ancient scourges, an unprecedented Aids epidemic in Africa and Asia, and in the wake of the defunct Soviet biological warfare programs with 30,000 scientists who disappeared - some apparently into the Middle East - the specter of bioterrorism.  (Indeed, some of the Sept 11 pilot-terrorists were getting trained with crop dusters, which could deliver small pox or anthrax to threaten millions.)  We may be approaching the end of an era in which we believed science was triumphing over human disease.  I now fear for my children.  Developments in India (plague) and the Congo Republic (Ebola) are also covered in grim detail.<br />It is here that Garret's argument begins to run into trouble.  What has emerged in the US, she says, is a hybrid of conservative ideology (blaming the victim with claims that health is the individual's responsibility) and a \\"medicalised\\" model whereby we seek high tech, individualized cures to ailments rather than the less expensive preventive cures that the collective public health model offers.  I believe that this is a straw-man dichotomy that oversimplifies the problem, in effect setting up conservative budget cutters to blame for a failure of collective will.  While this is certainly true to a degree, the political and economic dimensions of the problem are so complex that Garrett fails to do them justice.  Moreover, the medical approach is complementary to the public health one.  If the reader want a more realistic appraisal of these issues, (s)he must look elsewhere.<br />Furthermore, there are numerous inaccuracies and errors throughout the book, which damage its credibility.  For example, at one point Garrett states that Crick worked at \\"Oxford University in Cambridge, England\\"!  While this is trivial and an editor should have picked it up, it is symptomatic of the rushed feel to the book, which was obviously written too quickly and perhaps sloppily.  Moreover, Garrett glosses over a number of issues that deserved far deeper scrutiny:  she dismisses the demise of the Clinton health plan in one page (it was simply \\"overly complicated\\"), and rejects claims by the pharmaceutical industry that the cost of drug development is $500 million (because governments fund basic science).  The list of these errors and omissions is indeed long.<br />SO in the end the book is a mixed bag.  For me, it will serve as a treasure trove of information for my latest writing project, but I worry about the accuracy of many of her claims.  It is a very good call to arms for a serious issue and a warning to us all.<br />REcommended with reservation.hould have picked it up, it is symptomatic of the rushed feel to the book, which was obviously written too quickly and perhaps sloppily.

That it is almost certainly the best book on the development of the atomic bomb is in itself remarkable, as the field is already crowded with mediocre efforts.  Rhodes makes an entire era - the first half of the 20th Century - come alive in exacting detail.<br />THe book starts with a ruminating Leo Szilard as he wanders the streets of London, with the concept of an atom bomb germinating in his mind.  His pesonality is so quirky, his propensity to find just the right contact to advance his agenda, make him the ideal vehicle to follow the story of the harnessing of the atom for military purpose.  But to offer a full view, Rhodes starts with the Curies and their milieu, when they discovered radiation - a fundamental new form of energy that could not be explained by chemistry - that was the start of the 20C revolution in physics.  Not only does this story cover such luminaries as Einstein and Bohr, but it includes many others lesser known, who added their discoveries to the pieces of the puzzle that finally elucidated the structure of the atom.  These developments are also brilliantly set in European and American history, where the rise of Nazism renders them frighteningly relevant.  In addition, other issues are addressed, such as the reason for the sudden blossomng of several Hungarian geniuses, including Szilard and von Neumann, who left their homeland for the US.<br />Then Rhodes moves to the practical question of the Bomb's development, which was accomplished predominently by European scientists in exile and some remarkable Americans as well.  Here, you witness Enrico Fermi as he creates the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction in CHicago; the flowering of Oppenheimer's genius for administration; and the efforts that Heisenburg led, and perhaps sabotaged, in Nazi Germany.  Each personality is given the depth you would expect in a historical novel with adventure, such as Bohr's flight from Norway, and the infighting that went on behind the scenes.  It is simply a masterpiece of historical reporting.<br />Though his output has covered many topics, from his personal sexual history to hard scientific topics, Rhodes is indisputably one of America's greatest writers. I was fascinated by this book from page one and even took vacation time so that I could read it in peace while my daughter was in school.<br />Highest recommendation.perhaps sabotaged, in Nazi Germany.

This book has an author of obvious talent, interesting characters and fascinating little-known history, and yet it fails.  I believe that reason for this is that it reads as if it was written far far too fast.<br /><br />It is a story about a vanished world, that of the Gens de Coleur Libre in Pre-bellum New Orleans.  The main character is a talented, blond black boy, who develops a relationship with a man, a successful author who has returned from Europe to open a school in his native city.  The boy is desperate to escape from the provincial town to Paris, which his plantation-gentleman father promised to him and his concubine mother.<br /><br />Is it arrogance or sloppiness that allowed Anne Rice to write this so quickly and carelessly?  Was the editor scared to get her to edit it and re-write it, as she obviously did so brilliantly in her first two Vampire novels?  We may never know.  It is another example of what I regard as a squandered talent.  I will probably not try to read anymore of her books.<br /><br />Of course, if you don't care how well a novel is written, and perhaps my standards are too high, the characters are interesting in historical context.  Unfortunately, it devolves into melodrama.	2001-09-20

It tells the story of Margot and her marriage to the King of Navarre, an ambitious Hugenot in constant danger of assassination. With the backdrop of the religious wars, she finds love in a knight that she attempts to cloister from the dangers of court intrigue. It ends in tragedy, hope, and the promise of further adventure.<br />Based on available historical sources at the time and embellished with Dumas' unique sense of drama, it is a spectacular read, full of danger, sudden developments, and psychological depth. While it may not be as deep as Stendhal's best works, it is absolutely first rate as a historical novel, a genre that Dumas helped to develop.

You also get a wider view of the consequences of their affair on the delicate balance of his other relationships, particularly with his childhood lover.  And the &quot;relations&quot; are handled with extreme dexterity and delicacy, never going for cheap thrills.

As such, there is nihilism at the very core of the book, which Naipaul emphasizes by beginning with a tribe (just a name) whose only existing reference was that it was annihilated during the colonization.<br />And yet, this book is brilliantly written, full of drama of torture and interminable trials, great and bitter ironies that lead to what Trinidad became (or didn't), all of it adding up to a sense of the passage of human life and striving.  I loved this book:  it is a fascinating rumination by a highly talented writer, a dark essay on futility and non-history.<br />It may seem obscure, but then, so is much of the Third WOrld's history.

The characters seem as caught in the strange bureaucracy as does the reader in the seemingly endless text.<br />I still have no clear idea why this novel is supposed to be one of the greatest of the 20c.  While it pioneered a kind of political surrealism, it just goes in circles and nothing is ever resolved. Perhaps its sheer consistency is what makes academics proclaim its greatness.  There is little clear plot and the nothingness of it just goes on and on in a static Angst.<br />If you really read this, you may be as disappointed as was I.  It is yet another example of a &quot;classic&quot; that is unspeakably dull and perhaps over-rated by critics who are as far from the normal reader as an English professor can be from a lover of books.

Indeed, those who disagree with him or look down on him - and there are many at Harvard - sarcastically cite his writing talent as the &quot;reason&quot; for his enduring success!

There is nothing inherently wrong with this, except that it squanders a unique talent.  Perhaps she has said all that she has to say, but I still think she could do much much better.<br /><br />This story is fun if you want simple entertainment:  it has attractive people, plenty of bizarre sex, and an evil entity seeking to merge with a human.

You have a family being bred in thrall to an evil spirit as well as a good man - poor, working class Irish made good - swept into the mix.  At times, it creates a nice atmosphere of terror.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though the book has some of the pretense of aspiring to something more, it fails to do so.  The characters are too one-dimensional, the occult connections so elaborate as to get tiresome, and the circumstances increasingly outlandish, formulaic, and comic-bookish.  This is a pity, but then, she has made her choice.<br /><br />Recommended as a fun way to waste time.	2001-07-20

It was with great delight that I discovered I was wrong:  McCullough really is a distinguished historian and a terrific writer.<br />He made the era from the Civil War to the eve of World War 1 come alive through the story of one remarkable family.  From the standpoint of this rich, elite family, the reader witnesses a panoramic view of the period and all its conventions.  In addition, the author covers TR's psychology remarkably well, from his sickly youth to his acceptance of the banner of family honor when his stronger brother proved incapable.<br />Nonetheless, without becoming overly sanitized, at times I sensed that McCullough presented an overly optimistic view of the Roosevelts, much as does Doris Kearns in her (excellent) books.  TR's sister Bamie, for example, is mentioned as having a sharp tongue that expertly wounded many around her, though McCullough adds that she &quot;never did any real damage&quot;.  How could he know that?  Does it even mean anything to say such a thing?  Moreover, TR's father appears too good and upright to have existed, but then given the Victorian style of positive thinking (and writing), we will never know.  This optimism, I guess, reflects McCullough's temperament.<br />Warmly recommended.	2001-07-19

It is a defining work of modernism, that freakish period of creativity that ended before totalitariansism dominated Europe in midCentury, representing something, some presentiment, that Kafka had the genius to perceive and express.  Kafka's metaphor - of au unhappy and exploited young man waking up and finding (or thinking) that he has become a giant insect - is so rich and bizarre that it will live forever.  The Angst is unbearable, as is the detail of his vision.  It can be read on innumerable levels, which I have explored with each re-reading.<br />He was so proud and ambivalent about this story that, when breaking off his engagement, Kafka is reported to have sent it as an explanation to his bewildered former future father in law, saying simply, &quot;would you want your daughter to marry the person who wrote this?&quot;<br />Another thing about this story is that it is one of the few longer works that Kafka intended to publish.  All of the novels were drafts or exercises.  THis one was finished, and if only it survived, Kafka's reputation for greatness would be secure.	2001-06-26

That makes is a bit dated, but it is still a great assessement of the strnegths and weaknesses of US economy.  For the most part, Krugman was right:  we underestimated our strenghts and over-esteemed those of Japan, as the last decade demostrates.  For an economist, Krugman is a great writer as well, and his irascibility is fun, though not, I imagine, if his scorn is directed towards you.	2001-06-26

This book is so dense with detail and emotion that I was astounded and fascinated on almost every page.  It is simply brilliant, successfully bringing to life a dark and alien period of history.<br />WHile this book, at least in French, is touted as being about a man &quot;between the Medieval Ages and Renaissance,&quot; it is best at chronicling the personal consequences of the religious wars on everyday lives.  Zenon is an alchemist, but above all a tolerant and humanistic physician in an age of religious intolerance.  His caring and vision, after a neglected childhood in a merchants' household, are indeed deeply moving.<br />Zenon is a great original in historical fiction, an intellectual rather than a king or empire builder.  You follow him as he wanders about Europe, learning, teaching, healing, and occasionally loving.  The tenderness and empathy that he feels for those around him reveal the tenor of the times in exacting detail.<br />Warmly recommended.	2001-06-26

In this one, Harrison devlops his themes of clashing specie-civilizations, which are evolving in new directions as the events unfold.  The plot development is brisk, many of the ideas are new, and subtle conclusions are reached.<br />One of the great faults of sci-fi is that authors get too ambitious.  Afterall, they are telling us what the future of mankind might hold, so they tend to megalomania.  Due to his conceptual and storytelling talents, Harrison, like Octavia Butler, pulls it off brilliantly and believably.  His creation of an alternative intelligence - the social dinosaurs - is one of the most subtle and intriguing creations in all of sci-fi.  I have recently read these books over and found them just as interesting and complex as the first go.  If you like this kind of ambitious sci-fi, you simply can't do better than these books.<br />While my partners through the years have laughingly dismissed my love of sci-fi as comic book kitch - and they were usually right! - I must say that there is an occasional book that really has characters worthy enough to enter literature.  In my opinion, the characters in this book are that good.  They grow, they learn, and they struggle.  Their fates and choices are not at all predictable.  It is even moving.<br />Highest recemmendation.	2001-06-26

Why not indeed:  you can't delve deeply enough into these two substantial and complex lives in this context. THere is some useful comparisons made of their careers, but it is way way too ambitious.  While you do get many of the factual basics, which were indeed interesting, neither of these past Presidents comes alive.<br />REcommended only for the facts.  Look for flavor and pyschological depth elsewhere.	2001-06-26

At the time, it was one of those book I just wanted to get through for a grade, but there were details of it I remembered, such as the common practice of sllicing apples into thirds to represent the Trinity.<br />Well, picking up this book to re-read while living in Europe turned out to be a far greater pleasure than I imagined.  Huizinga offers an elegant portrait of an entire era, the Late Middle Ages, in both visual and intellectual detail.  You learn about codes of honor, the different ways in which life was perceived, and the practices of love.  It is beautifully written and vivid.<br />There are limitation to the approach, of course.  It is not about economics or living standards.  It does not function as a survey, and hence the reader must have solid knowledge of medieval history before starting the book.  You will have to get these elsewhere.  But if you come to this book with the right expectations, it is fascinating and wonderful from cover to cover.<br />Warmly recommended.	2001-06-22

They were so convinced of their brilliance and competence that they could not imagine they could make really big mistakes.  And much of that arrogance came from Harvard and old money.<br />What makes this book tower above the rest is the way that you get to know the major players, from McGeorge Bundy to McNamara to Lyndon Johnson.  THey are real people in this book, which brims with the most vivid mini-biographies, fascinating details that make the reader - or at least me - want to dig much much deeper.  The details are often incredible, such as the way that McNamara threw himself so deeply into his work that he nearly had a car accident while thinking about re-making Ford or how Bundy faked, brilliantly, having written a paper in prep school by speaking aloud.  It all feeds into the portrait of a self-satisfied elite that failed.  There is wisdom in the ability to doubt oneself.<br />While one can quibble with many of Halberstams's points and assertions, as historians are now doing, this is a great place to start to learn about modern American history and government.  Its lessons can stimulate a lifetime of study, which it did for me.  This book made such a deep impresion on me that it changed my life.<br />THere is no doubt that this is Halbertam's greatest work.  Highest recommendation.	2001-06-21

Becase of Maria, the half gypsy who may be a budding genius, Rebel Angels is perhaps the most charmng of all.  Maria is beautiful, lovelorn, and brilliant, a wonderfully articulate youth who is discovering her talents.  Her gypsy family is fascinating and very funny.  Then there is Parlabane, the villain tempter, whose &quot;unusual appetites&quot; are as hilarious as they are dangerous.  There are scenes is this one that are destined to become classic, as the knitting needles illustrate.  It is not for the sqeamish, however.<br />The second novel, What's Bred in the Bone, is less about academia and more about the art world over 40 years.  It too is fun, though much sadder than its predecessor.  With characteristic subtlety, Davies' characters manipulate eachother and play games within games, to the extent that if you like this kind of thing you can talk about it for hours.  Finally, the last novel was something of a dud for me, much flimsier than the rest.  I never could get through it.<br />Warmly recommended.	2001-06-21

Unfortunately, in this book he is content to spout back the conventional wisdom rather than do any new reporting.  So what you get is a vivid re-telling of things already known, with his usual depth thrown in.<br /><br />This book covers immense changes, not only in the economy with the rise of fast food, mass retail, hotel chains, etc., but in politics with McCarthyism, the Cold War and its proxy wars, civil rights for blacks, and the wave of suburban prosperity.<br /><br />If this is his worst, it is still very good.  Halberstam is one of our truly great writers.  It is a solid introduction to a formative decade. Recommended.	2001-06-21

It is full of extremely poignant stories, each of which would make for a great film or TV mini-series.  While it sometimes degnerates into polemic, the facts speak so loudly for themselves that they cannot be ignored.<br />I gave this book as a gift to my wife when she was about to emigrate to the US, more than ten years ago.  She gobbled it up and we still discuss it.<br />When I read this book, I wanted to learn more, perhaps read an entire history, about every story or chapter.  THere are fascinating characters that crop up, only to abruptly disappear, and many threads left uncovered.  This is not a criticism, as it is a survey, but it was frustrating.<br />You will not forget this book.  Get it.	2001-06-20

When at last I cracked the cover of this book, I was sorely disappointed at the unbearable pretention and lack of plot in this novel.<br />Stephen Daedalus is a callow snob, whose concerns are so otherworldly and obscure that they feed directly into the most ridiculously romantic and shallow stereotypes about artists as unusual gods.  It is simply a monument to a young's man's egotism and unerring sense of his own destiny.  There is little to learn from all the strange things he obsesses about, his experiences rarely ring true, and there is nothing notable about the writing.<br />This novel is probably coveted in undergraduate lit classes because most of the readers are untested adolescents, who feel they can conquer the world so easily.  Alas, as an adult it is just boring.	2001-06-20

It isn't funny, it isn't fun, and it certainly isn't very original.  Kafka wrote it as an exercise and that is all it should be.  Upon reading it carefully, I can only conclude that perhaps it should not have been published as it simply doesn't stand up to this master's best work.  As such it is really only of interest to scholars.<br /><br />Basically, it follows the journey through America of a clueless twit into a variety of catastrophic misadventures, from getting a maid pregnant without even understanding he was committing a sexual act to losing job after job in New York and environs.  While it does have some of the bizarre atmospherics that Kafka later perfected, the themes in it are not of the timeless horror and angst that later marked Kafka as a peculiar genius.<br /><br />Skip it and go on to The Trial or The Castle.  If you don't know Kafka, start with Metamorphosis.	2001-06-15

Normally, a travel book this old is simply too dated to be of relevance.  Instead, in this book we are treated to a deep meditation on the country with Naipal's novelist's eye and his persepctive as one of the first great writers from the Third World.  Indeed, if you know India, this is a travel book that predates touristic India, and so is an entry into history.<br />But there are so many images that stick in the mind, flashes of humor and melancholy.  I will always remember the pilgrimage he went on to see the &quot;miracle&quot; of an ice formation that appeared every year in the shape of a hindu god, though not in that year; the troubled American girl, Larene, who married a local musician in a moment of passion and was now attempting to ditch him; and the retreat in Cashmere, where Naipal got an incompetent cook fired in a fit of rage that he later regretted.<br />Get it.

If you ever had aspirations (or illusions) of being an artist, you should read this book. Not only is it a fascinating history of post-war modern dance, explaining the genius of Ballanchine and others, but it is an honest portrait of the pain and sacrifice that Tharp and others make to pursue their visions. You get to know that NYC scene of the 1960s and beyond in intimate and unflinching detail.<br />Tharp is a true original, self-made from the bottom up. You really get a feeling for the relentless drive, the long hours of work and experimentation, and the love that drive this artist to create. (At one point, she recounts the stress imposed on her upstate NY house of a dance troupe in its attic!) It offers both great advice and a cautionary tale. I learned an immense amount from this book at a moment - the mid-life crisis if you will - when I was reassessing my life course.<br />By turns funny and sad, this is truly great autobiography. Warmly recommended.	2001-06-11

As so often occurs with classics, I was as surprised as I was fascinated.<br />For starters, the characters are far more subtle than any of the film versions:  Victor F appears as a brooding and obsessed genius, but also as a great lover of life and nature.  The monster, who is an articulate and literate creature who read Goethe, is even more interesting, from his hopeful beginning to his bitter reaction at rejection and his thirst for vengence.  His eloquence was vivid and his pain horribly realistic.<br />But the work is also fascinating as a window into the mind of the Romantics, who at once strove to reject the rationalism of the Enlightenment yet reflected it.  The creature starts off empty and what it becomes is due entirely to his experience.  Knowledge is not always good, etc.<br />Finally, the themes are timeless and full of conflict:  creativity giving birth to unimaginable destruction, tampering with nature as its necessities overwhelm even genius, and the like.  THe book is a kaleidescope of philosophical reflection.  The pain of the creator and the monster alike are inescapably linked like father and son.<br />I did find the style of the book a bit difficult.  It is full of florid rhetoric and lengthy circumlocutions, as the doctor and then the monster tell their stories in almost identical prose.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-06-11

Braudel strikes a balance between these approaches, at one time examining the economic point of view (and related theoretical controversies, such as the ideas of Schumpeter on innovation), while searching for historical examples that support or obliterate them.  He is a true master scholar.<br />This volume adds to the first, moving from living standards to the establishment and functioning of trading and banking systems, both by capitalists (holders of sufficient resources to manipulate markets) and the merchants and craftsmen who operated within these markets.  It is a crucial distinction that demonstrates how simple-minded the ideological argument of &quot;free markets&quot; can be:  the rich can and do design economic systems to function to their advantage.  You follow the development of international trading networks by Italians, Jews and Armenians; the evolution of banking and the handling of paper money; and even the influence of social hierarchies on economic growth.<br />While Braudel concentrates almost exclusively on Europe in this volume, which lessens the universality of his approach, it is utterly fascinating from page one.  The economic systems he analyses were somewhat incomplete, though evolving rapidly.  An additional limit to his approach is the exclusive focus on econimic life.  At times, he views the building of chateaux and the commission of great works of art from the Reanassance to the 19C as a reflection of the lack of wealth-generating investment opportunities during a time of economic revolution!<br />And that is just a few of the issues covered.  Each section of the book is like an essay on some basic economic notion.  As such, the book assumes a great deal of historical knowledge in the reader, though Braudel often explains what he refers to briefly.  For me, this added to its appeal and density, but it is often hard going.  However, the book is leavened by wonderful and fascinating illustrations, which eases the task of getting through it at times.<br />Highly recommended.nsity, but it is often hard going.

It chronicles the relentless rise - and inevitable, brutal fall - of a talented and highly ambitious young man during the French restoration. You witness Julian, from his abusive childhood at a sawmill, as he gains the position of a tutor with the local gentry on the strength of his having memorised the entire Vulgate Bible, into the highest ranks of the aristocracy. All around him, there are characters in equal parts fascinating and pathetic, perhaps more interesting than he and yet his victims.<br />The protagonist Julian is at times cold, calculating, shrewd, a fool, and very sad, desperately in need of love. But he is always realistic psychologically and cunning, if lucky and then very unlucky. Julian bursts all of the limits imposed on him and in the process indicts the society from which he sprung and gained. This is utterly spellbinding fiction, into which you can go as deeply as you wish, from simple emotional reactions and an exploration of a rigid society, to structuralist symbolism if that is your bag.<br />Highest recommendation.	2001-06-01

Instead of a frozen doctrine whose outlines are generally agreed upon as a quasi-religion, Weiner demonstrates how the modalities of evolution - how it actually occurs in nature - are still under investigation.  It is a snapshot of an evolving science, carried out over a lifetime of research by two distinguished scientists.<br />One of the particular things they are attempting to observe directly is a speciation event - the creation of a new species of finch - which we long assumed must take place over geologic time and hence is unobservable.  But in the process, Weiner reviews the notion of evolution, with fascinating tidbits from Darwin's original research and thoughts on these same finches of the Galopagos.  It is a brilliant portrait of the cutting edge in science as well as a detailed review of many basic notions of evolution.<br />It is also a beautifully written book, indeed a masterpiece of elucidation.  And it is all hard science, rather than the pseudo-scientific pap that passes for it in so many popular magazines today.  While its rigor makes the book a challenge to read, it is well worth the effort.<br />Recommended, one of the best pieces of scientific journalism I ever read.	2001-05-29

I must have given this book to over a dozen people.<br /><br />Bradley goes through every incident in the Arthur myths from a startlingly original point of view, mixing pagan mysticism with solid historical fiction, which in her hands is unusually potent. I was utterly mesmerised by this book and simply could not put it down, though I enjoyed it so much I wanted it never to end. Best of all, the characters are not the stuff of comic books, but are flesh and blood people full of pyschological conflicts and their sense of duty. But the mysticism is also entirely believable, a parallel world of fairies and priests that become part of your imagination. I remember, for example, the description of the cynical Morgause, using magic for her own purposes of vision, by sacrificing a human to soar over the country and view of the destruction of the invading Saxons. So vivid, so alien, so believable!  There is also a magical world that is becoming more distant from Pagan Britain, whose time of separating from that we experience on Earth that is described in a wonderful hallucinatory rhythm, some of the most powerful fantasy writing I have ever seen.<br /><br />What is also fun are the twists that Bradley gives the characters, which are too numerous and subtle to enumerate. Arthur is not love-lorn but rather disinterested in Guenwifare, whom he marries out of duty and arrangement. Morgaine, the narrator, is a pagan who wants to preserve the good and honorable order from which she comes, rather than a scheming and evil witch. The list goes on.<br /><br />One of the best.

It is also beautifully written: ironically, though never the recipient of the Nobel prize, Freud did win the Goethe prize in Germany for his writing style.  As Walter Kaufman said so eloquently, with his rich ironies and attention to the individual, Freud offered a way to reintroduce poetry into science.<br />Certainly, much of what Freud thought is now disputed and discredited.  Like Copernicus, whose model of our solar system failed in many respects, Freud also made fundamental errors, in particular his notorious over-emphasis of sexuality and the phallus.  But we do not blame Copernicus for not seeing what Kepler, Newton, and later Einstein discovered:  we value him as a step towards the unknown, as a pioneer, however timid.  Freud will come to be seen the same way, as the discoverer of the unconscious mind.<br />Warmly recommended.	2001-05-25

However, had I not spent some time with one of the protagonists in this book and then a great deal more with his associates, I would never have clearly understood what they actually do and how they work. As it stands, this book offers a quick and dirty intro to the biggest dealmakers of their time. While some background and explanations are offered, it leaves out the gritty details and true complexity of what goes on in these huge and often risky deals. That disappointed me about this book more and more as I delved into my work.<br />Kadlec also adopts a kind of chummy tone with these guys, like they are bar pals as well as subjects for his work, and so you wonder what he may have left out to protect his professional relationships. He barely questions what they do and never really broaches the questions of ethics, as if such considerations don't exist; well, they do, and the people I spoke to were informed and concerned about ethics.<br />So this is merely a superficial trade-journalistic treatment. While this has merit, it is rather more like a vanilla milkshake than the full meal I had hoped for. I wanted deeper info, but then I was preparing to enter on a several-month project about a field I knew little about when I started.<br />The writing is also not very good, and lengthy interviews are included verbatim, which is a shoddy way to beef up the text to little purpose.<br />Not strongly recommended.	2001-05-25

He was my initiation in the endlessly engrossing world of jazz and his strikingly engineered appearence served as a way to distinguish myself from my adolescent peers who preferred rock stars.  I own at least half of the albums he made and still find new things in them whenever I listen to them.  There is genius in what he created.<br />Unfortunately, reading his story in his own words took more away than it gave me.  Miles Davis is, in short, a horrible person:  full of bitterness and hatred, despising women while exploiting them, and narcissistic to his very core.  His views are primitive and bigoted, so politically uncorrect that it demonstrates why PC is not all bad!  He was also wantonly self-destructive and frequently drug addicted, for which he offers neither lessons nor apologies.  The lack of care and humility in the way he reveals all of this is truly stunning and crude, written as it is in a ridiculously self-conscious black jive.  He literally embodies the notion that there is a destructive side to all creativity.<br />That being said, the book also offers a fascinating history of jazz, the major movements of which he changed or affected fundamentally at least 4 or 5 times from 1940 to about 1977.  It was an amazing career, and a great gift to us all.  And in this book, he offers himself up naked and scarred.	2001-05-25

For the last 4 years, I have read and re-read these classic tales with my daughter, who loves them as much as I did.  At 6, she is only beginning to yearn for more complicated sotries and characters.<br />While the stories at times appear a bit dated - they offer a curious mix of colonialism and advice on how to run a pluralistic animal kingdom - they offer wonderful lessons on how to get along with others.  The characters are caring and many of them are somewhat flawed, as they try to puruse principled lives in the jungle.  My daughter mentions them to me all the time when we talk about issues, offering us a common vocabulary and easy way to exlain things.<br />They also are simply very good stories, with adventure, humor, and plenty of good intentions.

Butler's vision of a chaotic LA is truly chilling, from the near-defenselessness of its innocents to the killing fury of its villains.  In a way, it is the most realistic and grim from of all her science fiction, the most likely to happen.<br />It never ceases to amaze me how ambitious Butler is!  In earlier novels, she invents a divide of human speciation as well as a hybrid race that springs from extraterrestrial genetic traders.  At the center of this story is an empath - a mutant whose abilities are not as fantstic as those in Butler's other novels - who embarks on a crusade to found and lead a new religion.<br />Thus, Butler addresses the great themes of humanity with great inventiveness and utterly superb writing.  She is a first rate novelist.<br />Howver, I did find this novel rather slower than her others.<br />Warmly recommended.	2001-05-24

This volume, which covers Johnson to his first failed Senate campaign (to an early talk radio host), is simply the most spellbinding and detailed bio I have ever read, utterly rivetting as Caro explores Texas and then national politics of a bygone era.<br />It is nothing short of the story of a political genius, who rose from nothing on his wits and energy and who had a good side and a dark side.  You feel that the full complexity of the man is contained within, from his bombast and cowardice to his uncanny ability to cultivate power and use his office to advance himself.  It is funny, sad, and the grandest political tableau that has ever been painted I think.  YOu get wonderful flashes of his bravado and humor - &quot;looks like old jumbo here needs a little exercise,&quot; he tells his brother when emerging from a shower - as well as insight into the issues and governmental methods of the time.  There is love (a mistress), disappointment (his loss), abuse (his father and his aides, who had to meet with him while he was on the toilet, etc.), and true caring (for his constituents).<br />If there is any problem, it is that so many threads are unravelled that many of them have to be dropped midway, never to be taken up again.  But then, that is what books should do: make you want to search for more.  And it is projected to reach 5 volumes.<br />One of the best books I ever read.	2001-05-24

When the character is sympathetic or funny, his novels succeed.  But when they are evil or too recondite in their pursuits, they fail, at least for me.<br />While my chess pals love this one, I found it frightfully boring, certainly one of the worst of his novels.  But then, that is really saying that it didn't work for me and is a matter of taste.  I just didn't like the character and didn't care if the end is yet another chess-like trick.  Indeed, the only reason I got through it was my own compulsion to try to read everything that that great novelist wrote.<br />Get it if you like weird chess masters and want to enter the mind of a particularly sick and narrow one.	2001-05-23

Unlike revolutions one and two - the steam engine and then the electric power tools that liberated us from dependence on muscle labor - this time it was the human mind, somehow magnified by dazzling new gadgets and software, that was supposed to generate economic value:  knowledge workers, engineers, and scientists would control data, the structure of matter, and even of life itself for our benefit.  For all its seductive hype - and the cult status of Wired magazine illustrates how extolling the third industrial revolution has become a cottage industry in itself - this vision remains controversial and unproven, now perhaps fatally flawed.<br /><br />In &#34;Building Wealth,&#34; Thurow wanted to examine it all by applying a formula he honed to perfection in previous bestsellers: he articulates, and to a degree analyzes, trends that we find confusing and frightening, tying them together in coherent form.  Only this time, while swallowing the fashionable rhetoric of info-revolution whole, he played a kind of booster who also wants to be a critic.  Barely able to contain his enthusiasm for the enormous fortunes then being amassed in the name of high technology, Thurow was mesmerised by &#34;glittering eye&#34; atop the &#34;wealth pyramid&#34; on the back of the dollar bill. &#34;Wealth,&#34; Thurow writes, &#34;is the only game to play if you want to prove your mettle...If you do not play there, by definition you are second rate.&#34; But he is also worred about the direction of American capitalism, which he portrayed as dangerously imbalanced in wealth distribution and opportunity.  The result is an awkward book that tries to do too many things at one time.<br /><br />Thurow is at his worst as a techno-booster pundit, and in retrospect he appears to have been as gullible as the rest of us.  That makes this book dated - badly.  Moreover, except for some vague references to the growing importance of knowledge in wealth creation, he never clearly defines what is new about the so-called knowledge-based economy. Is it the systematic application of science to business problems?  The emergence of new technologies?  Or sheer computing power? Rather than addressing these questions, Thurow presents a series of faintly illustrative anecdotes, such as the use of seismographic tests in the search for oil, which have replaced the old-style wildcatters who simply drilled holes.  This leaves a huge gap at the core of the book, allowing Thurow to avoid legitimate questions about whether the revolution exists as of yet (it doesn't) or whether the Panglossian visions of the Wired crowd simply conceal traditional, extremely conservative economic views (they do).<br /><br />In addition, the thirteen New Rules of his subtitle fail to add to the text.  For example, Rule One states:  &#34;No one has ever become very rich by saving their money.  The rich see opportunities to work and invest in situations where large disequilibriums exist...&#34; Such observations, which in my opinion are way beneath Thurow's dignity and talent, are sprinkled abruptly throughout the book as if some editor added them to mimic the banality of the &#34;Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.&#34;  It would be pathetic if it wasn't comic.<br /><br />It would have been far more useful for Thurow to step back and ask whether this booster rhetoric is premature or if it is even &#34;revolutionary.&#34;  As events have shown, the industries that techno-boosters celebrated were built on far shakier ground than was commonly acknowledged, even those like Cisco that supplied &#34;Internet plumbing.&#34;  Almost all of those hot new internet companies failed or remain stubbornly unprofitable, some disastrously.  In defense of these industries, techno-boosters invariably (now lamely) argue thatit is too early to judge (or &#34;accurately measure&#34;) these results and that extremely high failure rates are typical of &#34;embryonic&#34; industries.  Which is precisely my point.<br />Even the booming PC and telecommunications industries, which accounted for nearly 35% of the growth in the U.S. economy, were vulnerable. At any rate, an information-technology recession could finally put the sector back into realistic perspective:  it has improved productivity in certain limited applications, but overall its impact has been modest.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Thurow is a very good worrier. Sensing that something may be amiss in the U.S. economy, he returns with conviction to his familiar themes of education reform, the impact of social systems on economic well being, and the need for government investment strategies to create long-term advantages.  Though more traditional economists disdain Thurow's willingness to plunge into messy subjects that transcend their basic algebra, it is here that he has the most to contribute to the national debate.  That glittering eye on the greenback, he says, must be supported by a solid base in the &#34;wealth pyramid,&#34; that is, in order for any economic revolution to take hold, workers have to benefit as well.  Unfortunately, this is not happening.<br /><br />There it is.  I am sorry to say that this is a mediocre book, as I have gotten a great deal from Thurow's perspective in the past.<br />It is now so dated - after only a few years - that I would not recommend it.tely measure&#34;) these results and that extremely high failure rates are typical of &#34;embryonic&#34; industries.

No one defends and explains Keynes as well as Krugman, and his irrascibility is truly a pleasure in the usual rather dry discipline.  He treats us to a tour of recent economic policies and in the process demolishes both monetarism and supply-side economics.<br />Where he goes wrong is in his disdain for politics and the politicos who must sell economic ideas.  Krugman hates these guys, perhaps because he is so impolitic himself that he got pssed over for a plum job in the Clinton Administration.  As such, he denounces them with such fervor that the reader gets tired of the polemmic after a while, which is the only thing that detracts from an otherwise fine book and a masterpiece of the genre.<br />Warmly recommended.	2001-05-22

Today, however, we recognise that this frenzy of activity was both dangerously unprofitable and that the reasons behind it reflected the inability of Japanese managers to question this form of useless competition amoung themselves.<br />The sad thing is that this book was written after the bursting of the bubble economy in Japan in 1990, when so many of our illusions - akin to those that Americans had prior to the puncture of our own \\"new economy\\" bubble - were clearly revealed as the nonsense they were. Well, the authors in this volume apparently didn't learn much from that. Nonetheless, they remain content to spout the same stuff from their secure perches in Harvard and elsewhere. What a disappointment.<br />However, if you want to study this style of reasoning, this is a good place to begin. It is a kind of watered down economics, which focuses on the development and management of technology, by the government or in the private sector or both. This perspective is certainly not without merit, but if you focus on it as a prime cause, you may get off track in the attempt to understand the modern economy. I did.	2001-05-22

While I do not believe it is as good as the ones he has written on India and Islam, it was well worth the read.  What he concentrates on is the struggle of people to realise themselves, to find an identity in the chaos of modern life.  As he sees it, the plight of American blacks is very moving indeed, and beautifully written as always.<br />I think that where a lot of people get critical of this book is that they expect it to be academic and somehow definitive, rather than so personal.  Naipaul is a novelist, so what you get is anecdote and impression, rather than a comprehensive approach. If that is what you expect, this is a very fulfilling reading experience.<br />REcommended.	2001-05-22

Expendable scouts explore potential hive sites concurrently, dancing to communicate their suitability, until, abruptly, the entire swarm flocks into its new home. The locus of decision is a &quot;hive mind,&quot; a dispersed, shifting collection of instincts and tiny decisions that somehow transcends the actions of any individual, even the hive queen. Ant colonies be have similarly - and so do foreign currency fluctuations, the folding proteins that regulate the internal processes of life, and the predator prey struggles that shape global ecosystems.<br />The hive mind is a powerful new metaphor. It's not that scientists failed to notice bee hives and ant colonies before. The difference is that novel scientific tools - chaos&quot; theory, for example, and massively parallel computers - have allowed researchers to study and perhaps harness the unpredictable worlds of highly complex, sell-organizing systems such as the hive mind.<br />In &quot;Out of Control,&quot; Kevin Kelly examines the impact of the hive- mind model as it spreads into the scientific and technological communities. Scientists, he says, are beginning to explore more &quot;holistic&quot; problems, in which entire environments are their laboratory, with huge numbers of interacting factors. Steve Packard, fur example, hoped to re-create a prairie ecology in suburban Chicago, an experiment that succeeded over nearly a decade of false starts. He discovered that the order in which he introduced complementary species - grasses and the insects that disperse their seeds - or the timing of a clearing fire in the aftermath of a drought could radically alter the final shape of his reconstituted prairies. Although this and similar experiments, such as Biosphere 2, are competently explored by Kelly, they have already been described elsewhere numerous times). It is in the realm of technology that Kelly, executive editor of Wired magazine, has something to add. In dozens of interviews with academics and corporate researchers, tinkerer- artists in industrial lofts and even beekeepers, Kelly has uncovered a growing subculture that is systematically exploiting the complex forces of the hive mind, evolution and other self-organizing 8ystems. According to Kelly, their robots and smart computer programs will grow and evolve into useful forms, rendering obsolete all &quot;dumb&quot; manufactured goods, such as today's refrigerators, which cannot adapt themselves to ever-changing human demands. Take the smart office.&quot; an artificial superorganism&quot; envisioned by researchers in the Xerox lab in California. By embedding computer chips in every office system, from books that remember where you left off to lamps and chairs that anticipate your approach, they hope to create a sensory net that would adjust itself t~ your needs and habits. It could, Kelly reports, function as the opposite of virtual reality: Instead of bringing a viewer into a computer-generated world, the intelligence of the computer would extend into the room itself. But the user would have to surrender some control to a machine mind. If you entered the office of a hearing-impaired person, for example, the higher volume might puncture  your eardrum before the room would &quot;adapt&quot; to you.<br />These practical innovations are interesting and might revolutionize our lives. But beyond these relatively simple applications, Kelly's predictions begin to go badly overboard. These machines, he claims, would blur the distinction between man-made and living beings and give rise to a &quot;neo-biological&quot; civilization; as they take over their own reproduction and maintenance, he speculates, they will slip from our control. The task of the 21st century, he writes, is to relinquish this control &quot;with dignity.&quot; This is a frightening scenario, but the reasoning behind it appears lame to me. Despite its lofty goals, artificial intelligence has continually hit dead ends. The snag is that complex calculations take longer -the smarter you make computers, the slower they become. It is simply a copout to say that genetic algorithms or massively parallel computers will somehow allow a fundamental new forms of self-organizing intelligence to &quot;emerge&quot; in some unforeseen and unimaginable way. I do not believe, for example that the realistic computer animation in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; will eventually lead to the &quot;emergence&quot; of living cartoon characters, like &quot;real&quot; Roget Rabbits as Kelly insists.  Nor do I believe, as Kelly posits, that the new wired society will inevitably become more democratic; darker scenarios are equally also possible. Unfortunately, in his highly combustible enthusiasm, Kelly spews countless similar Panglossian predictions that are rather silly.<br />In the end, &quot;Out of Control&quot; is a mixed bag. At its best, it is a gallery of intellectual and technological pioneers striving to infuse the hive mind into our machines. They just might succeed. But at its worst, it reads like a random tour of the Internet, where solid information is punctuated by the musings of isolated nerds.<br />REcommended only with extreme caution.ial intelligence has continually hit dead ends.

WHile it is not a scholarly treatment with footnotes, etc. - it is from essays Wills wrote in Esquire - it is a very humane inquiry into what ambition and power cost the Kennedys.<br />Wills makes one of the most cogent arguments that that family, so obsessed as it is with winning at any cost, is in fact hiding sickness and brutalities from outsiders.  The story is indeed sad, as Wills concentrates on the lesser known characters in teh drama, such as Ted K's ex-wife, who was temperamentally unsuited to compete with this gang.  There is no doubt that this is one side of this remarkable political family.  To his credit, Wills does not let his political predilections intrude too much, but instead explores them as real people.<br />As always, Wills' writing style is beautiful and flowing, a true natural talent.

Take it or leave it, depending on your taste, but I loved it.<br />From my own school experience, I knew lots of kids like this:  they assume the world is waiting for them and make some grim discoveries about how hard it is to make it out there.  For Denny, because the story at school occured largely before the questioning of the sixties, the descent to mediocrity was much much harder.  (The historical asides on Yale in the 1950s are a fascinating subtheme of the book, as is the building of a career.) Many people will experience a kind of Schadenfreude at his story - handsome wonder boy losing - but it was tragic to me.<br />Trillin is a wonderful writer, perceptive and sensitive, funny, ironic.  He deserves his place in American letters.<br />Warmly recommended.	2001-05-14

Often, not even a boss or office rival is as irritating as this cold standard, the product of stopwatch-wielding efficiency experts and industrial psychologists who claim to have a scientific measure of &#34;average output.&#34; In The One Best Way, science writer Robert Kanigel examines the first so-called efficiency expert of them all: Frederick Taylor, the turn-of-the-century engineer and pioneering management consultant.<br /><br />Taylor's idea was simple: break down all jobs into their smallest component tasks, experiment to determine the best way to accomplish them and how fast they can be performed, and then find the right workers to do them. It was called scientific management, or &#34;Taylorism&#34; -- a formula to maximize the productivity of industrial workers. &#34;The coming of Taylorism,&#34; Kanigel writes, took &#34;currents of thought drifting through his own time -- standards, order, production, regularity, efficiency -- and codif[ied] them into a system that defines our age.&#34;<br />Though he had an enormous impact on our everyday lives, today Taylor is little known outside management circles. This is curious: in his own time, Taylor was a world-class celebrity, advocating an organizational revolution that would link harder work to higher wages -- as well as instituting shorter working hours and regular &#34;cigarette breaks.&#34; His books and articles were translated into all the major languages and passionately studied, even in the Soviet Union, as guides to a future industrial utopia; he was, in many ways, Stalin's prophet. Yet Taylor was also reviled as a slave driver who devalued skilled labor and despised the common worker, and he was ridiculed as a failure in many of his business undertakings.<br /><br />Much of Kanigel's book is devoted to descriptions of the shops that Taylor worked in: a ball-bearing factory, a paper mill, and machine-tool plants, to name a few. It's dramatic how different the world he describes is from the work environment of today. Here were no highly educated managers attempting to exercise minute control over relatively unskilled employees. Instead, craftsmen dominated these oily pits -- spinning steel-cutting lathes, constructing elaborate sand molds for machine tools, and maintaining the gigantic leather belts that harnessed the energy of central steam engines.  THis was in many ways the most fascinating part of the book for me:  I learned what people did in the decaying mills that surrounded my New England home.<br /><br />To all but the most practiced eye, such a workplace was a chaotic scene. What the craftsmen did -- and what they were capable of -- was largely a mystery to management, which deprived the managers of control and power, leading to a number of stunningly counterproductive practices. If tool and die makers produced jigs beyond a certain threshold, for example, 19th-century foremen would dock (!) their pay per item -- an obvious incentive for them to slow down. And because ball-bearing inspectors in a Fitchburg mill worked slowly and talked too much, they were forced to put in 101/2 -hour days, without breaks.<br /><br />Taylor witnessed such practices and decided to change them. In one of his most famous experiments, on &#34;Schmidt&#34;, he got a common laborer to double the number of bars of pig iron he transported down a plank each day. All he did was pay the man more, linking higher output directly to higher wages -- hardly a revolutionary thought today. His solution for the gossipy ball-bearing inspectors was to separate them, shorten their working hours, increase their pay, and allow them to relax occasionally; in return, they were expected to work harder, and they did.<br /><br />Once Kanigel establishes that Taylor's method worked well (to a certain extent), the book becomes tough going. Despite his elegant prose, Kanigel's exhaustive treatment of his subject's life and experiments strained my interest. Do we really need to know, for example, that Taylor once spent months alternating the size of coal shovels in the name of furnace-stoking efficiency? Or the entire list of his vacation companions for one summer?  Such biographical detail can add spice to a compelling narrative, but to include them only as an exercise in thoroughness, as Kanigel does, is simply tiring.  Taylor simply is not interesting as a personality.<br /><br />Kanigel also glosses over many important issues. Taylorism really did devalue certian kind sof skilled labor, and the costs have been high. The &#34;Taylorized&#34; doctors of the HMO era, for example, must work with administrators peeking over their shoulders, dispensing pills at the expense of empathy and other unmeasurable healing skills. And once factory workers lost their control and even their comprehension of manufacturing processes, many ceased to  take pride in their work and stopped making suggestions for improvement. This may be one reason why Japanese and European design is often superior to American. Taylorism also spawned the rise of management consulting, with its sham exercises and goals -- often a huge diversion of managerial talent in the name of efficiency. Kanigel, however, largely ignores this darker side of Taylorism; the true impact of his legacy gets lost in the details. The result is a 600-page profile of a narrow and compulsive man with a single, if influential, idea.<br /><br />Recommended, but only for scholars and specialists.elegant prose, Kanigel's exhaustive treatment of his subject's life and experiments strained my interest.

She is a fascintaing character:  taking over the Post after the suicide of her manic depressive husband, she was the one to bring it to greatness.  Not only did she overcame fear and terrible personal insecurity, but with Watergate and the Pentagon Papers she earned a place in history.  That is not bad for an heiress that everyone dismissed as a figurehead when she took over.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Felsenthal brings few new revelations to her well researched and long book.  The facts are there, as is much of recent US history, and this is extremely well covered.  Instead, what she adds is more on the level of back-biting gossip, such as the tales of her dysfunctional children, her fickleness at the office, or her insensitive quips about money (\\"you mean you have to live on your salary?\\" she is quoted as snottily and incredulously asking a reporter.)  At times, the book has the flavor of personal pique:  you can tell that the author doesn't like her subject or resents as her undeserving.<br /><br />Felsenthal even seems bent on undoing the reputation of her star editor, Ben Bradley, whom she portrays as a capable courtier manipulator of Graham.  While this perspective is useful, it appeared biased to me, too consciously against the grain of popular (admittedly perhaps mythic) image.  Essentially, she portrays Graham as a twit who will do whatever the last person with whom she spoke advised, hence Bradley knew to be \\"the last person\\" to speak to her.  I do not doubt that there is much truth to this, but Graham also did come down on the right side when she made the big decisions.  Is her entire image romantic PR puffery?  The author seems bent on convincing the reader that this was so.<br /><br />However, if you don't know the story of Kay Graham, this is a solid introduction.  Recommended with reservation.	2001-05-14

Very sad, the story describes a youth, coming of age, that is set in a deteriorating colonial situation in Vietnam as well as a family in a crisis of addiction and mental illness.  In the larger context, you really get a feeling for what it was like to live there then, as well as of the Asian and French colonial mentalities.  In contrast to many contemporary French novels, which I usually find very difficult to understand given their willful obscurantism, while exotics the characters are very real and easy to identify with.<br />Recommended.	2001-05-14

He wrote it while freelancing at the BBC, just out of Oxford and a fearfully anxious young man.

THe sense of passing life - this time from Roman times - is enthralling and wonderfully evocative.  Lestat turns out to be not such a bad guy, but far more sympathetic once you learn of his anguished background as the rebel of a declining aristocratic family in pre-revolutionary France.  It is so believable!<br />And the amazing images and scenes continue:  Lestat screaming so loudly in a theatre that the audience runs away; Lestat and his friend getting drunk and beating their heads at the realization of the meaningless of life; the oedipal kissing when he turn his mother into a vampire.  The characters in this one are still changing, with facets still being revealed at multiple levels.<br />It all adds up to a sense of wonder, which is Naipaul's definition of a succesful novel.

It is as if you entered 19C New Orleans and then Europe with curious, anguished inhuman observers.<br />This book is so good that it should be considered literature rather than potboiler gothic horror.

However, he usually covers political or social violence, with its chilling though unpredictable inevitability, as a portrait of a local culture.  In Guerillas, he follows the descent of a single sick individual, who covers his insanity with revolutionary rhetoric from another society, that of American blacks of the 1960s.  Though the rhetoric doesn't apply in Trinidad, the underdeveloped society lacks the structures to question it and he is allowed to continue his &quot;activism.&quot;<br />Reading this is depresssing and hard.  THere is none of Naipaul's characteristic humor in it, which provides such relief in his other novels, and there is not a single sympathetic character in it. Instead, we are treated to a gallery of losers and lost people, who come together in confusion and who are too stupid to have much fear.<br />THere are many notable moments in it, however.  THere is a deformed boy, for instance, who when he has money resolves to immediately spend on a movie, For Love of Ivey; as the movie ends - it is a romance in the US that portrays opportunities that Trinidad lacks - the boy feels despair as he hears people sobbing in the audience at their lack of possibility.  This is classic Naipaul, and demonstrates once again the greatness of his talent.  But it is so bleak.	2001-05-10

It is full of rumors, contradictions, and fascintaing stories, which it appears Herodotus didn't much bother to sort out.  He had humor, a gift from drama, and had wandered far aand wide.<br />Nonetheless, this is the sourcebook of a huge amount of classical history, in particular because the Persian empire was not a culture that wrote much.  It is the starting point of much of our knowledge of the era and a priceless point of view, however flawed it is when compared to the methods of modern historians.

And I suppose he was right.  This is a work with a simple plot - a beautiful farmer's daughter yearning to bust out of a boring marriage - that can be read on innumerable levels, which is one of the marks of genius.<br />Emma Bovary appears differently to everyone who reads about her:  as a brutal narcissist, an artist without a medium, an early feminist, a clueless provincial, a great romantic, a unique lover.  Perhaps the only thing that she could not be is a good wife and mother. I have read this novel many times, both in ENglish and French, and its layers and themes continue to peel away, always revealing something richer.  The langugae is simply exquisite, perfectly articulated and as descriptive as Nabokov, yet spare and full of despair.  It is a snapshot of one of the most realistic and complex characters in early modern lit.<br />A must read.	2001-05-08

In retrospect, these fawning books, such as Ezra Vogel's J as #1, appear ridiculous.  Then, as fears of J's superiority mounted, there was a rash of &quot;revisionist&quot; books, which argued that Japan was competing unfairly rather than better.<br />Now that Japan has faded from the scene somewhat, more balanced perspectives are coming out.  Smith's book is one of the better such ones.  Not only does offer it praise of certain companies and their innovations, but it does not flinch when criticizing the grotesque underdevelopment of the political system as well as the stunted individuality - the neurotic underside - of the Japanese character.  Smith demonstrates convincing that there is terrible sickness within, that the country suffers from a &quot;culture of irresponsibility&quot; and that the younger generation may be the one to make reforms - after the older one dies off.<br />It is deeply pessimistic, but for anyone who has lived in Japan, a welcome breath of fresh air:  critical but not a polemic, empathic without scorn.  Recommended.	2001-05-08

I think that we did not want to know about the flaws underneath the facades we constructed, though many of us suspected them.<br />This book takes a good, stark look at the arcana of dealing with Japanese businesses.  It is a world where appearences are more important than realities, where superficial politeness hides brutal power relationships, and where the correctness of routine is more important than the reasons - strategic or otherwise - behind them.  In practical terms, this reveals that what a lot of us thought about Japan in the 1980s was in fact meaningless ritual and blind procedure (following and copying), couched in nice terms (&quot;tatemae&quot;) that so many of us took at face value.  The reality underneath, the uglier side of things, is almost invariably truer than the nicer versions.  And now that Japan is seen as a beleagered backwater, we have no problem believing the worst.<br />That makes this book VERY valuable.  Unfortunately, it is written like an academic business book, which means its style is rather plain, rather than with the vividness of journalism.  But that may be my own bias.	2001-05-08

For example, there is a section on coprolites - petrified dino scat - that goes into what they are revealing about the ecology of the dino era.  In addition, it features a lovely photo of a smiling scientist, as she preside over her coprolites like a baker advertising her wares:  it is funny, informative, artististic.

It is remarkable that he wrote the Foundation while a young man, barely 20 I believe, a work with grand themes and the cornerstone of his  massive and sprawling future history of mankind, which I believe went into more than 50 volumes.<br />The basic plot is that a scientists created a new discipline, psycho-statistics I believe, that could predict the future behavior of huge masses of humans.  He then attempts to mold - or at least influence - man's fate over the next 30,000 years.  What is truly amazing is that Asimov succeeds in these volumes.  In a way, he should have stopped here with the series.  The ideas are crisp and not yoked into a determined framework, so are fresh with lively characters.  Later novels in the series feel more stilted, bound by concepts more than by a plain old good story.<br />A sci fi classic.	2001-05-04

Taking a long view of history, van Wolferen does a better job at demolishing Japanese myths and pretenses than most other writers.  I read this book when I had just arrived in Japan in 1990 - when Japan was in the ascendant with an asset bubble that was far greater than the US one that just burst - and was enthralled and repelled from page one to the very end.  Once I understood what he was saying, I saw how much it explained that hitherto I had found completely unfathomable.<br />Unfortunately, read at one go, it sounds excessively negative and pessimistic:  the Japanese appear feckless and weak, unable to rise above a history of division and obfuscation, etc.  Even worse, as subsequent events have borne out, it appears truer than ever.  Van Wolferen weathered extremely bitter attacks and smears because of this book.  All I can say is, for many who have never lived in Japan, the bitterness of foreign residents towards that myserious country is a puzzle to them: they wonder if it can really be &quot;that bad,&quot; if the attacks and vitriol are &quot;racist&quot; and the like.  To his credit, though he finds little to admire, van Wolferen never lets the tone of this book descend to the level of polemic.<br />While dated now - van Wolferen fretted that the Japanese juggernaut would take over the entire world economy - it is still a great read.  Get it, if you are interested in Japan.  You must know the argument, even if you stridently disagree.	2001-05-03

So this is worth reading, as it reflects the preceptiveness of a novelist at his prime, before he descended into his later curmugeon role who complains excessively of smells etc.  Of particular interest in his essay on the genisis of A Bend in the River, argubly one of the best and most original novels of the 20C.	2001-05-03

You get the most astonishingly vivid portrait of how he thinks (or how he wants you to think he thinks), in an array of beautiful stories and the most vivid of memories.  His views of a vanished Russia and then the emigre community before the Nazis took over are rendered in their full sensuality and comic vision; so are his early years in America. His first experience of writing poetry, in a kind of inspired trance, is destined to become a great classic of literature.  He even write amazing captions to the photos in the book:  I have remembered for 25 years how he described slapping at a mosquito in the night.<br />TO be sure, in spite of being a genius, he views are limited and sometimes stunted.  But he can't be everything to everyone:  if you take what he can give, it is well worth the ride and then some.  I wanted to know what the man was like who wrote Lolita, and this was the best place I could find, even as he manipulates and distorts.  His is one way to measure a life.	2001-05-02

The perfect opportunity came along with this book, which is a rhetorical analysis of the Gettysburg address set in historical context.  Wills offers not only Lincoln through his own words, but a vivid window into a past era.<br />From it, Lincoln emerges as a political genius, who invented an entirely new kind of public discourse with the G address.  Instead of following the current fashion of long addresses, which to his credit Wills does not ridicule, Lincoln write a short piece that would be picked up and repeated verbatim and in the process initiate the healing of the nation.  As part of the context, Wills explains the meaning and history of cemetaries, which is far more interesting than I imagined possible.  But that is part of Wills' remarkable art:  he unearths these things and shows us how they fit together.  And hs writing style:  sheer beauty and clarity.	2001-04-30

When I picked it up, I found myself transported not just to the early Renaissance, but to Greece, where the story begins with Pythagoras and others.  Koestler approached this as a lone intellectual, rather than an acacdemic, which means that he went back and read all the original sources to see things for himself rather than rely on secondary texts. That gave him a vivid feel for what these discoverers thought and did that is sadly absent from most survey histories available.<br />The result is a unique master work, in which you feel you get to know Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo as well as their classical predecessors.  The science is explained as are the dead ends, and some harsh judgements made:  Koestler was not timid!  He also succeeds is putting the discoveries into context, as the standard against which scientific discovery has come to be measured.<br />Though I studied this in high school physics, this is what truly made this period come alive for me.  I will reread this for years to come.	2001-04-30

Clueless about the machinations around him and the pathetic hangers on that want to steal some of his glory, in his poet Burgess paints a disspiriting picture of the 1970s literary  scene in London.

Unfortunately, at least for me, they simply don't have the same comic and bitter vivacity of his earlier work, as they are toned down and moderated somewhat.  I felt that either his energy or his drinking - which he alludes to and which was new to me - has dulled his sensibilities.<br />What is new are some of his stories and a more systematic treatment of the man you get so many fleeting glimpses of in his brilliant essays.  Perhaps there isn't quite enough to him to make this all that worthwhile.  Afterall, he has not had a great emotional life:  he loved a boy when he was 18, who was killed in WWII, and he never really loved again.  Instead, what he seeks is simple sex with no real involvement, and I don't think he understands what he is missing.  That certainly explains the absense of love in so many of his novels, or its continual betrayal in the search for power and glory.<br />Nonetheless, Vidal has had a charmed career, and he built it by himself - &quot;I worked&quot; as he says, in contrast to his step sisters whom he says were 19C women looking for men to support them.  There is less of his famed meanness and combativeness in this memoire and more of a man looking back with pride and some forgiveness.  His essays are more fun, but perhaps less mature.	2001-04-27

For me, this follows a cycle:  1) I gobble them up, 2) begin to tire of them as I find life for me, as interesting as my own experience is, just isn't what it was for them, and then 3) burn out on them for the rest of my stay.<br />When we moved to Italy, I vowed to read only a few this time.  Well, I started with this one and can report that I have reached my third stage already!  The country that Mayes portrays is one of ever-lasting beauty and courtesy in spite of all the hassles of disorganization and dishonesty, which she experienced in spades when trying to renovate a Tuscan house.  She soaks in the sun, always seems to fine the best food, and unearths antiques buried on her property with just about every footstep, or so it seemed to me.  Her time in Tuscany, for it is only during the summer and Christmas break that she goes there, always seems a kind of timeless ecstacy.  It appears as a kind a never-never land that is the oppositie of the mundaneness of her California life.<br />Well, I am sorry to report that I know of no one here - in Italy - who believes anything near her idealised version of our chosen home.  It is an extraordinary hassle to get the simplest things done here, people can be as obtuse and rude as they are anywhere (if not more), and the weather isn't always nice!  The Italians have a talent for beauty, but NOT for organization.  THe proportion of difficult fools, I must add, seems rather high.  And getting paid for what you have done in accordance with a contract!  Now I won't even begin to go into that...<br />While she does explain some of this negative side in her house adventure, I suspect that the limitations of her medium - the travel book - made her need to emphasize the sunny side WAY OUT OF PROPORTION.  OK, she is not a reporter, but people are going to read of her ecstacies and make real decisions.  As such, her rave review of Italy is misleading and a disservice.  For anyone who is contemplating buying a house here, I suggest trying to live her year-round first, to see what it is really like.<br />Don't get me wrong, there are wonderful things about living here. We wouldn't stay here otherwise. It just needs to be balanced better against reality.ve review of Italy is misleading and a disservice.

But at their best, they can provide a new framework and vocabulary to adress complex new issues.  PDP was just such a book on the auto industry, which was in serious crisis in the 1980s.<br />This is one of the first and best books on concurrent engineering (cross functional development) and it sets a very high standard.  It is well written and persuasive.  While some diagrams are overly ambitious - one has 59 arrows and 14 explanatory captions - it rarely gets bogged down in jargon or long proofs.  Upon re-reading it, it does not at all appear out-dated; indeed, their prescriptions appears to have been learned and integrated into many American industries, from autos to computer networks.	2001-04-26

But for anyone who lived in Japan, it is hardly surprising.  There was so much ridiculous hype about Japanese management, science and technology policies and the like by ignorant academics and credulous reporters that it made foreign residents sick with boredom.  Having been steeped in that laudatory literature as a student, I went to live in Japan to learn more, only to find that the Japan I read about simply didn't exist.  For a while, I, like Woronoff before me, made my living debunking that hype.<br /><br />Woronoff wrote this book as a corrective to the hype and mediocrity of such thinkers as Ezra Vogel, the title of whose book Woronoff mocks.  It is excessively combative and personally bitter, as he felt that he was being ignored, but so much that he says resonates with truth for those is us who lived there.  When he wrote it, not many readers wanted to hear it.  Unfortunately, he presses his point so hard and so far that he essentially self destructs in the end, as even a sympathetic reader such as myself got tired of the tone.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I got a great deal out of Woronoff, for there were things that he understood long before others did.  For that, I must thank him.	2001-04-25

There are always surprises.<br />In contrast to the looser Herodotus, his near contemporary, Thucydides sought to record an &quot;objective truth&quot; of the great war between Athens and Sparta, in the 5C BC.  He consulted multiple sources and carefully judged what to include and what not to include, in accordance with his evolving idea of what really happened.  While some of the forms, such as made-up speeches, differ from what we would do today, he set a new standard for accuracy.  THe result is a work of genius, the first serious attempt at writing history rather than merely storytelling.<br />Reading this is not always fun.  There are long sections that are lists of occurences, with references to individuals who appear and disappear without followup.  But there are also penetrating analyses of remarkable characters, such as Perikles, Alcidiades, and other great generals, who became reference points to the present day.  Thucydides also covered political science - how institutions actually functioned - in new ways, with demonstrations of how the unleashing of passions led to their corruption or distortion.  Finally, there are chilling sections with timeless insight in human conduct in war, with the full horror of the breakdown of all order and law.<br />THis translation is also emminently readable, far better than the rigid and more literal one I first read in college.  THucydides is quite eloquent in this version.  There is also a good introduction to put the work in perspective.	2001-04-25

While I dutifully plowed through it, I was depressed by the emptiness and psycholigical terror of just about every story.  THe Novella of the title is a sad journey in Africa made by two residents of a roped-off European area, through the background of appalling civil war that eventually touches them.  They are mediocrities with nowhere else to go, one the aging wife of a has-been journalist, the other a man who exploits poverty-stricken male prostitutes.  THe other stories are similarly bleak.  One tells of a beaten-down man who is trying to help his brother as they struggle to emigrate to England.  Another recounts the misadventures of an Indian man who moves to Washington, DC and marries an American black woman by default.<br />It is a strange collection of stories and travel, a testament to despair and chaos.  Naipaul's other books are better and have far more humor.	2001-04-24

Books	5	3	3	N	N	a great reporter with a long history of China interest	Salisbury's book is so good, his reporting so valuable, that it will provide ample basic information to future historians as they attempt to sift through this period with some scholarly distance.  Just prior to Tiananmen &quot;incident&quot; as it is called in China, he went and talked to the last surviving people who remember Mao and Deng, the two most powerful leaders of Communist China.  It was a unique time, as China was open for just a moment during a reform period before shutting down again after Tiananmen and those people were about to disappear forever.  Salisbury found them and recorded their memories.<br />The result is a masterpiece of reporting, bringing Mao and Deng to life and in detail like no other account that I have read - and I have read a lot of them!  The book concentrates on government and power politics, leaving the details of policies to others, which strikes just the right balance.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-04-24

It makes many of the same points that &quot;Greening AMerica&quot; did, but from the perspective of a European.  Revel believed (rightly in my opinion) that the US was engaged in a fundamental experiment of the kind of society it wanted to be, an impetus coming from the bottom rather than from the top elite.  He took a sympathetic view of the youth revolt in the US, which he saw as far less ideological than their counterparts elsewhere and hence more open-minded and practical.  He may have been right.<br />The particlar fun of this book is the way he punctured European, and particularly French, pretentions to hold a monopoly on the progressive left.  He applied acid sarcasm and hilarious examples of their prejudices against the US, which sound so petty today.  Indeed, he shows them up for the snobs and hypocrits that they still are with great wit.<br />ALong the way, he makes many points that hit home, such as, it is not what is done that is necessarily most important, but the process and ability to change things democratically that is.  That was the great gem of wisdom that I took away from this splendid book, when I read it 23 years ago.  Revel's is a unique and talented voice.  It is a pity more of his books are not translated nto English.  His recent memoire, available only in French, is truly brilliant as well.	2001-04-23

As it turns out, his life was also fascinating:  he was a classmate and best friends with Sartre before becoming his great adversary during the post war debates on Marxism, was in London for the French resistance during the war, and became a television personality late in life.<br />In French, Aron writes with a grace and clarity that are astonishing.

One of the great original voices, Naipaul has a genius for serving up exotic characters and helping us to empathise with them.

At that time, in the wake of My Lai, Watergate, and the Pentagon Papers, the press had revealed to Americans how much we really resembled other powerful countries and the depths to which some of our politicians fell.  Halberstam makes the people who contributed to this collective glory come alive, from Kay Graham at the Washington Post and Buff at the Los Angeles Times to Seymour Hersh and William S. Paley, founder of CBS.  He tells the stories with his ususal high and humanistic style, in an unmistakable moral tone (at one point he laments that the Munsters were created in place of a news program).  He also reviews the presidency and politics from about Eisenhower to Nixon in fascinating detail, with plenty of editorialising, such as Nixon's snubs of his original patrons at the LA Times.<br /><br />It is truly great reading, but in the end there is a bit too much of it.  In retrospect, it also appears dated, and perhaps places a bit too much faith in the press.  For those like myself who increasingly feel that the press is ridiculously focused on personal foibles instead of issues and failed to do its duty during the Clinton scandals - preferring to keep a trivial story alive rather than point out that it has all, like, happened before - they will find little support and that Halberstam had any inkling of when things might go too far.<br /><br />Nonetheless, no one has done a better job at telling the story of the press, in print and TV, than Halberstam.  He also succeeds in putting a great deal of issues in proper perspective, such as the rich careers of Walter Lippman, Teddy White, and Walter Cronkite.	2001-04-23

Regardless of whether a must-read turns out to be right, this category of book establishes a vocabulary and logic of action that people will discuss and attempt to implement for years to come, as did &quot;The Fifth Discipline&quot; and &quot;Reengineering the Corporation.&quot; In contrast, the no-read books, which are far too numerous to count, serve principally as resume builders or as crude promotional plugs for consulting firms. As cynical public relations gestures, the no-reads are entirely derivative, repackaging someone else's ideas while implying that you need to hire the authors to gain deeper insights.  Indeed, what they have to offer can be summarised easily on the book flap, beyond which only captive student audiences or gullible clients would ever venture.<br />&quot;Race for the World,&quot; another in the series of books by McKinsey &amp; Co. consultants on how to operate in the global economy, straddles the great grey area in between these two poles.  The book starts off with a strong analysis of the &quot;transition&quot; economy, in which geographic barriers are rapidly falling before the globalist wave: world's financial markets converging and digital technologies are lowering communication costs; national governments are &quot;under market pressure&quot; to remove the old legal and regulatory barriers to global competition; consumers are gaining unprecedented power, both to find the best prices through some convenient dot.com company and to vote via their investment dollars.  This ongoing race (or &quot;midgame&quot;) will determine which corporations can position themselves to become the &quot;shapers&quot; of the next century.<br />The midgame, the authors assert, offers extraordinary, though rapidly vanishing, opportunities around which to build new corporate strategies.  With their new-found access to foreign markets, corporations can create &quot;virtuous cycles of geographic expansion,&quot; simultaneously increasing their scale of operation, lowering their costs, and using new incoming profits to continue to invest elsewhere.  Finally, by setting up their own networks of information, corporations can take advantage of cross-arbitrage opportunities, that is, buy goods and services from whatever country offers them cheapest.<br />So far so good. While none of this is particularly new or original, it is in the formulation of strategies that the book will stand or fall. According to the authors, global firms must invest in a variety of intangible capital, including intellectual property, talented managers, networks of able partners, and brand image.  If a corporation can integrate these intangible assets into a system that operates as of a piece, the authors maintain, then it will have established &quot;a compelling global value proposition&quot;:  while single elements in the system may be replicable, imitating it as a whole is far more difficult for competitors.  Furthermore, the authors argue, global firms should &quot;control, [though] not own&quot; the value chain, which represents a reversal from the practices once praised in large, vertically integrated firms. Sensible advice.<br />Unfortunately, at this point the authors cross the line that separates lack of originality from banality.  Firms must, the authors solemnly inform us, approach potential deals with the appropriate risk assessment techniques, many of which were developed for investment bankers.  These techniques include:  1) &quot;disaggregating&quot; the many risks involved in large business decisions, that is, breaking them down to examine who bears what risks and for what, etc.; 2) focusing on those risks for which the firm enjoys &quot;familiarity advantages&quot;; 3) portfolio theory, i.e. diversification spreads risks; 4) options theory, or the ability to acquire afirm at a specified date in the future for a known price.  These techniques, the authors conclude, will allow firms to &quot;overcom[e] confusion (lack of necessary knowledge), complexity (unknown interdependencies), and uncertainty (unknowable future events).&quot;  While top executives are perhaps too busy to reflect on these strategies systematically, it is difficult to imagine that they haven't thought about these things already.<br />However, there are deeper flaws at the core of the book.  For starters, the seductive rhetoric of globalism is accepted as a given and fails to realistically anticipate any other contingencies, which is a disservice to business readers. The authors' insistence on proper risk analysis techniques cannot capture these complexities.  Instead, the authors treat us to a simple extrapolation of current economic conditions. It remains unclear whether the current boom represents a structural trend (a &quot;new economy&quot;) or another speculative financial bubble.  Confusing the two can lead to terrible mistakes.  Unfortunately, though its purpose is to devise better strategies for managers overwhelmed by global change, &quot;Race for the Future&quot; offers no useful guidance in this regard.<br />Even worse, evidence that contradicts their vision is ignored. The authors naively assume that globalisation is an unalloyed good, that consumers will prefer cheaper, more uniform goods to traditional indigenous varieties.<br />Many of these shortcomings can be explained by the poorly hidden agenda of the book.  How, one wonders, could four intelligent co-authors ever agree on a detailed analytic framework?  The answer is simple:  the book is part of the McKinsey &amp; Co. publicity machine.  It promotes a company methodology, the conclusions of which come straight from McKinsey &quot;research,&quot; a kind of parallel universe of jargon, anecdotes, and fierce internal competition for attention between young &quot;associates&quot; fresh out of university.  I suspect that, under the steady hand of good ghost writers, &quot;Race for the World&quot; was cobbled together from disparate articles from the McKinsey Quarterly with over-confidence and little critical regard. As a result, the book's &quot;authors,&quot; imbued with the company's mystique, fail to recognise the mediocrity of their ideas and advice.<br />Nonetheless, &quot;Race for the World&quot; is no no-read.  As long as the reader is aware of its limitations, it offers a solid introduction to gung-ho globalism.  While the book contains more than could be written on a book flap, its ideas could have been resumed in, say, one article in the McKinsey Quarterly.e a firm at a specified date in the future for a known price.  These techniques, the authors conclude, will allow firms to &quot;overcom[e] confusion (lack of necessary knowledge), complexity (unknown interdependencies), and uncertainty (unknowable future events).&quot;  While top executives are perhaps too busy to reflect on these strategies systematically, it is difficult to imagine that they haven't thought about these things already.  <br />However, there are deeper flaws at the core of the book.

It remains unclear whether the current boom represents a structural trend (a &quot;new economy&quot;) or another speculative financial bubble.  Confusing the two can lead to terrible mistakes.  Unfortunately, though its purpose is to devise better strategies for managers overwhelmed by global change, &quot;Race for the Future&quot; offers no useful guidance in this regard.<br />Even worse, evidence that contradicts their vision is ignored. The authors naively assume that globalisation is an unalloyed good, that consumers will prefer cheaper, more uniform goods to traditional indigenous varieties. <br />Many of these shortcomings can be explained by the poorly hidden agenda of the book.  How, one wonders, could four intelligent co-authors ever agree on a detailed analytic framework?  The answer is simple:  the book is part of the McKinsey &amp; Co. publicity machine.  It promotes a company methodology, the conclusions of which come straight from McKinsey &quot;research,&quot; a kind of parallel universe of jargon, anecdotes, and fierce internal competition for attention between young &quot;associates&quot; fresh out of university.  I suspect that, under the steady hand of good ghost writers, &quot;Race for the World&quot; was cobbled together from disparate articles from the McKinsey Quarterly with over-confidence and little critical regard. As a result, the book's &quot;authors,&quot; imbued with the company's mystique, fail to recognise the mediocrity of their ideas and advice.<br />Nonetheless, &quot;Race for the World&quot; is no no-read.  As long as the reader is aware of its limitations, it offers a solid introduction to gung-ho globalism.  While the book contains more than could be written on a book flap, its ideas could have been resumed in, say, one article in the McKinsey Quarterly.	2001-04-19

Vidal takes us into the mediacracy age of politics, that transition point when TV personality was beginning to trump backroom dealing as the principal factor in national politics.  Clay, the protagonist, is so Kenndyesque that it is painful to behold.  The backdrop of eroticism in politics is also wonderfully portrayed, as are other human qualities and frailties.  For example, when he writes of a Senator consulting a fortuneteller, you can almost forgive a certain first lady for consulting an astrologer:  it is scary to make decisions.<br />This is interesting as Vidal hadn't quite gotten the tone of his American series yet, but clearly it was gestating in him.  He is one of the best American writers of this century, underrated in my opinion.	2001-04-19

But in this novel, I believe that he sincerely admired Lincoln, which raised his writing to an eloquence that few of his other novels attained.  In addition to his cabinet and entourage, Lincoln really comes alive in this one, as a political genius who used machiavellian means to attain his goal of keeping the US unified.  THere is much humor and wonderful stories of the manuevering that went on behind the scenes, which can be read again and again at leisure.<br />This book was so stimulating and fascinating that it encouraged me to become a Civil War buff.  That is the mark of great historical fiction, that it is a fertile starting point.  But nothing else I read seemed so immediate, so real.  It is so multi-sided that, soon after we met, my future wife and I argued about Vidal's Lincoln for hours.	2001-04-19

It is beautifully written and hilariously funny in places.<br />His early life was rather chaotic, both as a Christian Scientist and because of the ups and downs of his father's business, which meant they were frequently poor and the the children farmed out to grandparents.  What is remarkable is his rise, from voracious reader to first-rate literary talent.  Blocked from admission to university because he was put on a &quot;craft&quot; track in the leather trade, he gave it up and went abroad, the next best thing to a degree.  In Paris as a semi-bohemian, he started writing, which led to jobs and a career.<br />His descriptions are so marvelous that I have remembered some of them for over 20 years.  While a child  writing for public-library event, he said he wrote the words so that they would &quot;burn into the table&quot; (if memory serves!); the essay was so good that the teacher thought he was really a professional writer.  Nothing spectacular, but a first-rate story of coming of age.<br />I recommend it for any aspiring writer who wants to feel that some order might emerge from his/her chaos of early hopes.  ALso for the literarati, it is the emergence of an unusual mind.	2001-04-19

In this book, Yogi puts it all together in a wonderful excursion into his life and mind, and the result is very very fun and funny.  He is really from a less cynical time, when it was easier to believe in heros and you could take things more at face value.

He travels all over the world for National Geographic, taking nature photos as well as reporting on cutting-edge discoveries in the rainforests.  As such, he succeeds at mixing art and science in this book, which is somewhat technical, but explained in clear language that laymen can understand.  THis book changed the way I  saw rainforests:  fully 9/10s of their biota are in the canopy, in the leaves high above, which you would never imagine from the ground.  And Moffet went up there with camera to photograph it with some of the world's best scientists.  The result is absolutely masterful.<br /><br />It is truly a pity that this book is out of print.  I wrote a review of it for the Boston Globe when it came out and later met the author, Moffet.  He was as interesting and colorful as the book, full of hilarious stories of his adventures.	2001-04-19

It is a peculiar mix of cynicism and a sincere tract in favor of psyhotherapy, with one of the best descriptions of a Jungian analysis available in fiction.

Unfortunately, I thought it was really bad, with the worst characteristics of the Romantic style.<br />The book starts off in the sea, with a counter-revolutionary aristocrat about to be delivered to the shores of Brittany.  Then there is a whole chapter where a cannon rips free in the ship's hold, so detailed and melodramatic that it can only be there to symbolise something-everything that will fillow in the novel.  The tone is surrealistic, with moralising asides thrown in as the cannon crushes sailors left and right.  From there, the book just plummets downhill:  it turns out that the aristo's ward, who is as good as he is evil, is the opposing representative from Revolutionary France.  There is also a Revolutionary hanging judge, a guardian of ideology, who just so happens to have been the boy's tutor who loved him as the son he never had.  Etc., etc., getting more and more outlandish as the plot thickens.  There is even a section of dialogue, where the guillotine talks of its task and function, also dripping with the crudest symbolism.  Of course, the end, which I will leave to the reader's imagination, is supposed to summarise how the Revolution ate its own children, oozing with puerile irony.  While there are some good points to the novel - in particular the scenes with Marat, Robespierre, and Danton in debate - they pale in comparison to the ridiculous coincidences and gushing moralistic melodrama.<br />Hugo may be one of the few classic authors who needed films to edit out the poor plot devices he employed.  His work makes great films, but the full novels are simply over the top.	2001-04-18

There are many mysterious references that are explained in later volumes, which serve to whet the appetite.  Benford maintains a sense of mystery and wonder quite masterfully.  In later volumes, it gets deeper and much better.<br /><br />The plot is that a space pilot, Nigel Walmsley, an iconoclastic Brit.  He discovers a remnant of an extremely ancient space vessel, which he disobeys orders to explore.  What ensues is a wonderfully enigmatic encounter with an alien intelligence, whose intentions are not clear, though at times it seems menacing.  The novel leaves many questions unanswered, in such incidents as a beam of energy that affects the way the Nigel can think, somehow changing the organization of his brain; there is also a signal of a change in the human genome.<br /><br />The characters are what makes this writing exceptional, even if their sexual predilections (2 f's and one m) are a bit much after a while.  Benford is a very good writer, one of the best at hard sci fi, but you do feel at times that he is straining to think up what happens next.	2001-04-18

Though it smacks of Horatio Alger at times, it is indeed interesting and fun and stimulates interest to dig deeper.  THe best parts of this book are the history of the US.<br />Unfortunately, when you do dig deeper than she did, what you find is not very pretty: a genius in business, Joe Kennedy was a tough SOB who would fleece anyone to get richer.  Even Kearns has to mention, for example, that he ripped off investors when he got out of Hollywood - ruining many poor people who believed in him - and that his father, a local banker and businessman, burned his account books when he died so that his son would not pursue small debtors he wanted to help out.  The Kennedy kids were thrust into power as instruments of his ambition, and it cost many of them their lives, as we know.  There was a lot of good in them, but they were bred to become powerful, and what they represented in politics had less to do with conviction than as a means of ascent.<br />I learned a great deal from this book, so recommend it.  But it is also sentimental and ignores too much evidence that contradicts her fawning vision of this elite family of voracious appetites.  I suspect the Kennedys recognized Kearns' predilection for nice people and charmed her into willing submission.  Afterall, they are true pols, so they used her.	2001-04-18

THis is a long book, 900 pages in the French version, but I sliced through so fast that I was sorry when it ended.<br />The plot outline is simple.  The four musketeers - for there really are four - want to help the queen in her love for Lord Buckingham of England.  All the rest is intrigue and adventure related to that.  But the episodes are so funny, the chemistry between the characters so subtle and realistic, that it makes for a truly great read.  Indeed, the characters of the musketeers are so well drawn, their inter-relations so complex, that a film or even a miniseries simply cannot do it justice.  The glimpses at historical personnages is also fascinating, from Richelieu to Louis XIII.  Finally, you get a flavor for the Paris of that epoch, just after the religious wars.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-04-18

This is fine, even if it is something of a limitation.  WHile she prefers to avoid the &quot;pathography&quot; genre, unfortunately I feel that she gives people of power a bit too much of a break.  She clearly lives in a different world than Robert A. Caro, who tries to balance the good with the undeniable evil and abuse.  Kearns' world is populated by people of good will, inspiration, and talent; their backroom deals, egotism, and other less appealing aspects are mentioned, but do not seem to infect the more positive sides of their character.  It is one view, and quite valid as far as it goes.<br />ALso, Kearns' personal presence is in this book.  SHe was an aide for Johnson, whom he cultivated and then used to ghost-write his self-serving memoir, The Vantage Point.  So she is well versed in Johnsonia and 60s history and has great stories to tell about Presidential electric toothbrushes and the like.  But you can also tell that she loved the guy - he would even creep into her bed at his ranch, where she describes herself as listening to him instead of you know what.  I think that that great pol seduced her, if not physically then spiritually.<br />Kearns' voice is an important one, as her presence on TV attests. SHe is a fluent writer with a distinctive voice of unwavering optimism.  However, you just have to wonder if she glides on the surface and avoids the tough questions, preferring instead to buy into self-promoting myth.	2001-04-18

It is a true masterpiece of exploratory fiction, from the opening paragraph, &quot;The world is what it is,&quot; to the closing images of moths &quot;white in white light.&quot; Its world is brutal and alien, yet brings out the humanity, vanities, and hopes that all of us share.  As a window into the mind of underdeveloped countries, it is unsurpassed.  It is so superior to Conrad's Heart of Darkness, to which it is so frequently compared, that critics should not even mention them together.<br />The writing is plain, yet elegant, a quiet symphony as it portrays a journey of violence and despair and growth.  Once I finished it, I read it again from cover to cover in a single sitting, transported into these alien lives that only occur in  few novels I have ever read.  As such, it can serve as the starting point of a lifelong inner conversation, the true mark of a classic.<br />This novel was written at the high point in Naipal's career.  He was just becoming world famous and this one cemented his reputation.  It is a pity that his subsequent works never quite matched the sweep and depth of voice in this novel.  Now he is criticized, perhaps rightly, for his sexism, his pessimism, and his petty prejudices.<br />But this novel is one of the best I ever read.	2001-04-17

If so, what will be the cause and how will it happen?  Octavia Butler addresses these questions in this fine novel.  I was about to say that it was one of her best, but then her books usually divide themselves for me into the excellent and the truly outstanding, and there are more of the latter than the former.  The quality of her fiction is better than any scifi writer I have ever read.<br />Her characters, even inhuman mutants, are entirely believable as they embark on the strangest of journeys into the unknown.  And it is so well imagined as to be completely believable.  Usually, I have to fight to stop thinking, &quot;OK this is someone just thinking this up.&quot;  Butler puts you into these fantastic worlds.  So the heroine of this novel enters into a struggle with Doro, the vampiric mind-entity that has bred humans with purpose for thousands of years.  As the culmination of his efforts - a theme in sci fi from Frankenstein but since then never so freshly done as Butler has - she will either grow beyond him or be destroyed.<br />Butler understands power so well, not so much from the point of view of those accustomed to wielding it as from those who must submit or die trying to escape it.  Outstanding.	2001-04-17

Yet within him is a being of extraordinary sympathy and quirky intelligence, which floursihes under Nabokov's comic and tragic gaze.  Only those who come to love him experience the treasure that lies within him, and as he is revealed to the reader, who can fall in love with him or not.  Though very little occurs in this book in terms of plot, Pnin's existence takes on a kind of significance.

While Wills appears to have led a charmed life - breaking easily into conservative journalism and finding love at the same time - it is the essays that are in my opinion the best part of the book.  In them, he argues with great sense about why the lack of hard and unyielding convictions in politicians is a good and useful thing (it is their job to horse trade); and why radical change can destroy more than help (society is like a complex living organism).  I have thought about these simple, pragmatic ideas for years, and he articulates them better than anyone.  The art of politics in democracy is careful change, when society is ready but also when it becomes necessary.  He also takes cynics, like Tom Wolfe, to task for ridiculing the liberal and radical pretentions of celebrities.<br />This is a truly wonderful book, which too few people have ever read, from one of America's best political writers.  It is ironic that, while he identifies himself as a conservative, the drift to the right of American politics in the last 25 years makes him sound more and more like a liberal.	2001-04-17

This trait distingusihed her from her knuckle-walking cousins, the great apes, though she shared their smallish brain.  This irrefutably proved that human ancestors had the ability to use their hands before developing the large brains that made abstract thinking possible.<br />THis is just one of the fascinating hypotheses that this explorer-scientist relates in this book for general audiences.  Paleoanthropologists use the tools of geology and evolutionary biology to study human origins, an approach that has yielded an explosion of discoveries and new techniques that are described in detail.  The authors also present the findings beyond the terrain of paleoanthropology, in such disciplines as microbiology, in which the existence of a genetic &quot;Eve&quot; was calculated, the single common ancestor of all humans of 100,000 years ago.<br />THe authors also tackle such thorny issues as the million year gaps in the fossile record, whether there is such a thing as race, and whether our brain size makes humans unique in the transmission of cultural learning.  Among the book's highlights are the stunning  photos by David Brill, a specialist in human fossil photography.  Many of them depict life size skulls, which evoke the mystery of who we are as they stare back form the page.<br />Although too narrowly focused to become a best seller, this book is a masterpiece of popular science writing that requires no special training to understand.	2001-04-17

It moves between so many subjects - from a German artist parodying Hitler's siegheil to empty fields, Hasidim logging in the woods of Poland dressed in their customary suits, to the Baroque fountains in French parks - that it is impossible to summarise his message, except to say that we Westerners have a changing relationship with forest, rock, and water.<br />I was dazzled by Schama's erudition and mastery of language, as he moved from making connections between Egyptian mythology and the fountains of Rome, or the myth of Robin Hood and rustic Englsh eccentrics of the 19C.  This is a book that enhances one's experience, particularly if you live in EUrope and every day walk by the things that he describes.  For example, I read it while we were living on the edge of Fontainebleau forest, in France, and inside the back cover of the book, I found a map of the forest that included our village of 600!  To my astonishment, I then went on to read that Fontainebleau was apparently the first forest to have marked paths for hikers who visit from industrial cities, a method pioneered by a somewhat loopy bonapartist who had retired to the area, and whom the local authorities watched with suspicion in mid 19C.  For anyone who loves hiking or sitting outside, you will find sections like that that speak to you, that are illuminating in a quirky personal way.<br />However, while these passages are wonderful and fun, for me they did not add up to much of anything beyond anecdotes.  I enjoyed the facts, as a kind of entertainment that passed by as I read on, but they failed to coalesce into any deeper insights.  In that sense, the book came up short for me, though many of the tidbits were indeed delicious.  Rather than traditional history, this book is a huge and sprawling essay, like on of those old-style New Yorker articles that went on and on and on, until the point seems lost in detail.he point seems lost in detail.	2001-04-16

Indeed, they have raised pride, scorn, and sarcasm to such high art.  But they were also great pioneers, from the political caricatures of Daumier to modernism.<br />Germinal was one of the first truly excellent muckraker novels, exploring the complex tableau of oppressed workers in early industrial society.  THough there is some excessive melodrama in the characters, they open a world that few would be able to know without direct experience.  We should never forget how new this was, how much of a pioneer Zola was.  It is a huge success.<br />But the novel also stands very well on its own.  The writing is austerely beautiful, textured to feel as dusty and cold as the mines themselves.  THere are realistic good guys and bad guys, highly complex characters who enter into difficult fights, who were types that Zola largely invented and that have been copied many many times.  On every page, I wanted to find out what would happen to them, how they grew or died, where they were from.  I hoped for them, pitied them, and hated them and even wept from them in the climactic ending when a glimmer of humanity transcended the class struggle for just a moment.<br />I was fascinated and repelled by the world Zola recreates, which has been my reaction to French culture throughout my contact with it for the last 32 years!	2001-04-16

It has it all: characters, concept, and the sweep of time that create that sense of wonder you find in the best literature. I have re-read this novel three times, and each time I find it better than the last: with hauntingly crisp images, compelling and very human issues, a kind of universality that is almost inevitably missing in genre fiction. The most amazing thing is that the reader can suspend his disbelief and abosrb all this weirdness as if it were occuring. And the characters are almost all black, from specially-bred mutant strains in Africa to fugitives from an evil immortal in America.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a wise woman mutant, who was born in Africa.  She is immortal, a shape shifter who can read genetic information by tasting it, and profoundly moral being.  She is approached by Doro, another mutant, who has an agenda into which she might fit.  What follows is an epic battle of wills, from the 17C to the 19C, that changes both of them profoundly.<br /><br />Butler continually grew as a writer, and perhaps was one of the best contemporary novelists in America.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.	2001-04-16

For all 900 or so pages, I was completely absorbed.  Never once did I glumly look at the last page and calculate the percentage of the book that remained.  It is the ideal starting point for anyone wishing to investigate the most disturbing episode of American history, a stepping off point that is also a pleasure to read.  Afterall, what other survey histories won the Pulitzer prize?<br />However, as a broad-brush history, I found myself quibbling with the author's choice of detail in the areas that I knew well.  For example, I would have liked to see more coverage of the brutal race riots that occured in the Northern states, incidents that revealed extremely disturbing fault lines in race relations that persist to this day.  By choosing to neglect this and other details, I felt that the author refrained from contemplating the deeper meaning of the war, even or providing the building blocks to do so.  While interpretation is certainly not his primary task in a survey, it does get short shrift here.<br />Nonetheless, every American should read this book.	2001-04-16

Da's family were landlords, part of the ancient class of scholar functionaries whose livlihood depended on both landholding and passing the Confucian examinations as a way into the imperial bureaucracy.  As that system broke down and terrible upheavals followed, Da's family was humiliated and then brutalised during the Chinese revolution, pushed down to a lower status.  But in CHinese tradition, the family stuck together and continued to stimulate, educate and support its children while struggling to survive.<br />It is a remarkable story, one that reflects what happened to millions of Chinese families in this century.  Indeed, Da's family was lucky in that they were not all executed, as were up to 3 million &quot;landlords&quot; following the 1949 communist takeover.  The story of Da is also timeless, in that talent and hard work can pay off, even in an atmosphere of hatred and suspicion.  Da was also true to his class, which had the advantage of education supported through generations and of gentlemanly assumptions in the ancient Confucian way.<br />Unfortunately, I did not like the tone and style of this book.  Da has written in an almost childish voice and there is something strangely self-serving about the way he dwells on his rise.  While he and his brother triumphed over terrible odds by passing the university examinations, bringing honor and new status to their families, it smelled of inevitability throughout the book.<br />This is not to diminish his accomplishments, which I deeply admire.  Da is obviously a driven man and will go very far, no doubt acting honorably as well.  It is just that a harping presence - like a stream of narcissism - flows throughout this memoire, settling old scores while not quite bragging.	2001-04-12

But when I returned to it nearly 30 years later, this time in the original language, I felt a far deeper sense of awe at the characters and their interactions, all of which lead to their growth, even if in sorrow.  WHile their dilemma is something I will probably never experience, I identified strongly with the characters and their philosophical dilemmas, this time as a middle-aged man whose life course is set and who has his own family and love.  The French is spare, but utterly clear, giving the book a mournful texture in its North African context.<br />The book is so rich that I do not believe one can pin down or define the principal themes:  we all interpret it from the perspective of ourselves and where we stand at the time that we read it and they are ever changing.  I believe that that is what defines a true classic:  it is universal yet endlessly reflects back to the reader's subjectivity.	2001-04-12

Unfortunately, in contrast to her other novels, I found this one rather lugubrious and static, its action stilted.  Fortunately, I perservered, as the remaining novels in the series are utterly superb and up to her usual standards.  This is uusually the reverse:  a series starts out well and then gets over-played, developed beyond the poitn they should have been.

I was completely sucked into the characters, concept, and plot.  The device of the alien child - a hybrid that is different from humans in obvious but also extremely subtle ways - is a unique creation in sci fi.  His journey is fascinating and cruel, which makes a dark philospical statement on human nature.  The dialogue is as excellent as you would expect from any fine novelist.	2001-04-12

WHile reputed to be a classic, I found it not only deadly dull at times, but often unbelievable.  Nonetheless, there is much to recommend it.<br />The main character is a callow Italian bastard-aristrocrat who embarks on a series of catastrophic misadventures only to end up as a pious preacher.  He is mediocre, boring, and unbelievable, particularly in his choices of love.  However, the wider tableau that Stendhal paints is far more interesting:  you see the Napoleonic dream ideal and what it did in conquered areas, you learn how a whily courtesan manages a horrible prince, and see alternatives to the American-money oriented society in 19C Italy.  That is where the real story was for me, rather than in the central character:  he is a kind of vacuum that gets you into fascinating places, from the battle of Waterloo to the fictional prison tower of Parma.<br />It is not Stendhal's best, but you may enjoy it.	2001-04-12

Afterall, Harrison wrote the Stainless Steel Rat series, which is simple swashbuckling sci fi jokes.<br />But when I started it, I was immediately drawn in by the strength of the charaters, writing that was as beautiful as a statue, and unusually well developed concepts.  His skill at plot and character development are wonderful.<br />This is a novel about the conflict between separately evolved intellignent species, which assumes that the dinosaurs never died out in EUrope and have come to colonise the Americas.  The dinosaur mind is so alien, so subtle, so cogent, that I found myself completely believing in it, from the way that they communicated in the day through color changes in their skin (disallowing them to overtly lie) to the cyclical nature of their vision of the universe (the &quot;egg of time&quot;).  Even their science and technology are different:  they grow everything, so feel connected into the web of life in their own way.  Of course, the humans are well developed characters as well.<br />This is a masterpiece of the genre of alternative histories.  I am happy that it is back in print.  Sci fi can be literature in the hands of a skilful writer.  Warmly recomended.	2001-04-12

Alas, when I picked up this book, I found a world of Hitler obsessions, death worries, multiple divorces, sexual blackmail, and toxic waste disasters.  Perhaps there is some satyrical level that I didn't get, but I couldn't identify with any of this.  THe characters are two dimensional and the story is too outlandish to be taken seriously.<br />Is it my imagination, or are contemporary novels supposed to be bizarre?

Her novels get better as the series advances!  Usually, they degenerate, like movies sequels, where you get more of the same as the auteur tries to milk it (Remember that sorry Planet of the Apes?).<br /><br />This is the story of the emergence of the third human sex, an ooloi, the product of genetic mixing with an alien species that has taken over the Earth, saving it from destruction at man's hands.  The ooloi is an extremely dangerous development, a catalyst for genetic manipulation who if undisciplined threatens to create plagues and disrupt entire ecosystems.  In appearance female, the ooloi is extremely seductive and becomes a peacemaker with the human resistance to the aliens, almost a saint.  As weird as it sounds, it is completely believable and fabulously written.<br /><br />Butler develops her vision and concepts, leaving the reader with a feeling of wonder at the universe.  Only the best novelists do this:  her talent goes far far beyond the confines of the sci fi genre.  Indeed, I wonder if she is not revitalising the novel as a form of art, pointing new directions. She deserved her MacArthur prize.	2001-04-12

It epitomises Balzac's greatest themes:  the provincial trying to make good in Paris, the wreckage in the wake of unbridled ambition, and the complexity and brutality of machinations that few come to understand.  Alas, while there are more good guys in this Balzac novel than others, in the latter half of the book the vast majority of them still streak towards financial disaster and their own obscure miseries as they do in most of his novels.  But what a great way to learn about what people used to do in those sumptuous chateaux you see all over France and in those splendid buildings in Paris!  It is utterly spellbinding and a wonderful view of history.<br /><br />If you like Balzac, and I love him, the pleasures are akin to addiction: you know what you are getting into when you uncork that bottle, but you just can't stop yourself and it's great while it lasts.  Every time I crack one of these novels, my wife rolls her eyes because she knows I am going to rant about the hopelessness, foolishness, and pain of these characters over the next few weeks.<br /><br />What can I say?  The 19th Century was the century of the novel and this is one of its best.  Balzac turns the bitterest pessimism into the highest art.  Just be forewarned:  you need to have a strong stomach to get through it.	2001-04-10

Yourcenar chose Hadrian because he was a great leader that pre-dated Christianity, whose mentality is so alien to our own, and spent decades researching and struggling to express her insights in the proper form.  With him, you survey the Roman Empire in its multiple facets, from the excesses of its newly rich to the bloody revolt of the Jews that led to the destruction of the temple of Jerusalem.

From black holes to the big bang, cosmologists have created a new vocabulary that pops in the unlikeliest of places today, far outside of their original and strictly qualified scientific domains.<br />Davies is a rarity amoung popular science writers.  Not only does he stick to hard science without over-simplifying, but he avoids the excesses in speculative claims that boosters foist on the uninformed public.  In clear and concise prose, he examines the cutting edge of the field of time, as framed by Einstein and extended by recent research and observations, with grace and humor.  It is a masterly performance.<br />While he does not avoid the fantastical worlds that may be beckoning, such as a black hole being a gateway to the end of time, Davies never neglects the flip side of such phenomena:  any ship that went into a black hole would probably be crushed or would be unable to communicate what it had found, as not even light can escape.<br />THis also means that, while Davies explains the building blocks of the new cosmology with unusual clarity, he also exposes the flimsiness of its foundations.  We do not know, for example, what constitutes 9/10s of the mass of the universe!  Nor can we explain many of the oberservations of the Hubble telescope, such as the discovery of stars that appear to be older than the universe itself.  Now THAT more is exciting than off-the-wall speculation!  Our theories, Davies demonstrates, are far from complete.	2001-04-10

Of the hundreds of popular science books that I have read, I can say without hesitation that this one may be the worst. And yet its tone is utterly arrogant and self satisfied. It is truly a monument to the author's egotism.<br />Though billed as a science book, there simply is no science in it.  Instead, it is a kind a hagiographic biography of Eric Drexler, who has done nothing but talk.<br />However, if you are uncritically convinced of Drexler's vision, which is nothing if not arresting, you will probably like this book. What it does is seek to elevate Drexler to prophet status before he has accomplished anything but unproven hypotheses at best, and speculation and hype at the worst.	2001-04-09

The authors argue that the reductionist approach to science, which has flourished over the last 300 years, for a more holistic or contrextual approach.  In the reductionist approach, scientists have choped problems into manageable bits - lab experiments or discreet mathematical problems - that eventually they assume will be fit together into a coherent whole.  Nature in this view functions as a vast machine they can reduce and separate into its component parts.<br />TO prove their point, the authors embark on a dazzling tour of biology, chemistry and physics.  But something is missing say the authors.  What we know, they claim, are tiny islands in a sea of ignorance; it is self limiting as the larger questions get neglected.  It is the causes of simplicity, they say - the order that suddenly emerges - that researchers should explore.<br />So, they conclude, it is time for a new set of questions.  Unfortunately, just when we expect something new, it is here that the book gets a bit vague, with the authors falling back on anecdotes and speculation.  They try to coin a new vocabulary (&quot;simplexity&quot; for the old and &quot;complicity&quot; for theirs); offer some diagrams of what they want, including an odd picture of mixing smoke with a unicorn head; and they harp on strange and abrupt conclusions, such as the importance of squid fat to the evolution of the human brain.  But they do not offer a coherent new paradigm.<br />An uneven effort, but fun and very funny at times.	2001-04-09

It is clearly written and covers the essential facts, but it lacks taste and deep interpretation.  In others words, it can be studied but should not be read for pleasure or even intellectual stimulation.  I used it to complete certain gaps in my knowledge of Chinese history, which was necessary and useful, but it just feels so academic and pedantic.  Maybe that is what must happen in most general survey introductions like this one:  it is stripped down so far that it cut not just fat but muscle and bone. In contrast, &quot;The Search for Modern China&quot; by J. Spence is a work of art as well as history, and constantly stimulates the reader to probe deeper, farther, opening a world.

THere is nowhere I know that you can learn so much about what life was like over the several hundred years just prior to the industrial revolution.  Every page has some delicious tidbit that makes readers reflect on their lives.  For the most part, subjects that are usually written about in a dull manner, such as demographic trends or aggregate food consumption statistics, are translated into readable prose.  THus, the book succeeds both for laymen and specialists, a very hard balance to strike.<br />It greatly enriched my intellectual experience.  I read it on an extended trip to China, where it gave me a huge battery of questions to ask about the fields I was observing, the organization of its cities, and even the fashion choices of the people.  On my return home to Europe, it also informed so much of what I thought for weeks on end, as I reassessed my surroundings and even pondered where I fit into society.

Just for fun, I opened it up to peruse it a bit.  And then I became totally engrossed and read it again cover to cover.  THat is the test of a great book:  you can read it again and again and see more each time.Of all of Vidal's novels, this one has the most ideas:  the main character (a Persian ambassador to Athens who despises what he hears Herodotus reading) recounts his meetings with the creators of the several great cosmological systems, that is, monotheism, buddhism, and confucianism, all of whom may have lived within one person's lifetime.  These are some of the principal systems that have undergirded world civilisations ever since.  Vidal recounts them with fascination and acid wit.But that is not all.  At the core of the book is a portrayal of court life at the high noon of the Persian empire, a hotbed of intrigue, fellowship, and sex.  You learn about subject Babylon, Xerxes' alcoholism, and the governance via eunichs from the inner chambers of the queen's harem.  What is most original is that Vidal sets Persian civilisation in stark contrast to the more primitive Greeks, who were enjoying their own golden (Periklean) age. This neatly turns our Western self image of Greek glory on its head, and is hilarious as well as effective satire (though Vidal is so subtle that I may be misreading him here).Highly recommended, the best historical novel I ever read.	2001-04-05

In my reading, Spence explains better than anyone why the Chinese currently prefer stability over democracy and why the country has made a slow and halting entry into the modern world.  While making no excuses for the excesses of the Party's leadership, Spence chronicles the immense change that Mao and his successors initiated, not from the standpoint of solely the 20th Century, but over the last 300 years.  If you are looking for a single book that provides a 360° view of the evolution of this ancient and complex civilisation, this is the book for you.  Spence is also a master of eloquent and concise prose, refreshingly un-academic in tone and yet a brilliant synthesis of contemporary research.	2001-04-04

Once I opened this book, I became so absorbed that it was as if my life was put on hold until I could finish it.

Like the best of SJ Gould, the book has real flavor because its author has a strong point of view; but just Dawkins' writing style - clear, bold, beautiful - should make it a classic of the popularization genre.<br />However, the strong view also points to bias, in Dawkins' case a combination of strict genetic determinism and an obsession with computer analogies.  Frankly, computer simulations and pseudo-discovery stories, which over-rated magazines like WIRED promote and hype ad infinitum, are boring:  so many of these books on &quot;complexity&quot; etc. just repeat the same stuff.

I liked his descriptions very much of vulture flight and other awe-inspiring natural adaptations, but they were the only items that were truly new to me.  Indeed, his Mount Improbable analogy is not as good as the traditional depiction of the tree of life. Better to stick to his earlier classics.	2001-02-23

This is certainly an interesting book:  it gets the reader to re-think his/her place in society and wonder about his/her life choices.  However, as with all attempts to reduce a topic as complex and ever-changing as human nature to a simple formula, its certainties and claims wind up sounding a bit glib, if not arrogant.  Because evolutionary biologists can posit that their discoveries are &quot;scientific&quot; by their choice of a methodolgy, they forget that the answers they find depend almost entirely on the questions they ask. For example, because male fruit flies are promiscuous (i.e spread their DNA), Wright argues that that explains why virtually all men have wandering eyes for the &quot;scarce eggs&quot; of women other than their spouses.  Thought-provoking yes, but, gee, maybe the problem is a bit more complex.	2000-10-10
