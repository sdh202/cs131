This is because it deals with the other world, the world beyond death. That is one of the common truths that keep coming out in interview after interview with living shamans from ten different traditions. Another of these truths is that you don't choose to become a shaman- the spirits choose you. Nor is it a matter of ego, for the shaman seeks to transcend the ego barriers that separate him or her from becoming one with both this world and the next.<br /><br />_The author chose ten modern day shamans that had the feel of authenticity and integrity. That feel comes across in the interviews, for beyond a brief and perceptive introduction, he lets his subjects speak for themselves. As the author states, he didn't select these people, he merely held a vision of the kind of people who he wanted in his book- and they found their way to him.<br /><br />_The range of traditions is broad, but they are all clearly speaking of the same experience- but with differing details and emphasis. It is a truly global sampling: Cherokee and Seneca , Dagara (West Africa), Amazonian,  Kahuna (Hawaiian), Tibetan, Celtic,  Santo Daime,  Mayan,  Apache,  and Australian.<br /><br />_The book is well illustrated with both full-color pictures of the Shamans, as well as of the land to which they are connected. There is a listing of contact addresses to reach both the contributors and organizations. There is a full index.	2005-10-07

However, the world of the early 20th century was obsessed with materialism and effectively ignored this finding. Those few scientists that did review the work came away convinced, more often than not. The problem was that most \\"reputable\\" scientists wouldn't even consider it- a problem that continues to this day.<br /><br />_The author of this pioneering volume was F.W.H. Myers, the cofounder of the Society of Psychical Research. Myers was not some fringe crank, for he was a recognized classics scholar, platonic philosopher, poet, and son of a clergyman. It was Myers who first translated and introduced Freud to the British public. He was also the originator of the term \\"telepathy.\\" He was a meticulous and conscientious investigator. That is what strikes you about the vast compendium of cases included here- they were painstakingly documented, all witnesses were carefully interviewed, and sworn affidavits were obtained. In no way can this be considered a book of \\"hearsay.\\" Myers covered a wide variety of phenomena from hypnotic trance, dreams, possession, mystic ecstasy, telepathy, mediumship, clairvoyance, automatic writing, phantasms of the dead, to actual evidence of the survival of the subliminal elements of personality after death- because he correctly considered them all to be in some way interrelated.<br /><br />_So, in life, Meyers effectively proved survival of the personality after death. But that was only half of his work. Starting a few years after his death his spirit started communicating with widely separated mediums in England, the United States, and India. The result was a huge body of interconnected messages called the \\"Cross Correspondences.\\" This work consisted of over 3000 messages delivered over 30 years, and of such a complexity- and consistency- that they provide absolute proof of the survival of Meyers and several of his colleagues.<br /><br />_So you see, the case for survival of the spirit was effectively made over 100 years ago, but it is still effectively ignored by a mainstream materialist society with its own agenda. But that doesn't make it any less true.<br /><br />_This new edition has an introduction by Jeffrey Mishlove, Ph.D; the foreward by Aldous Huxley; and the introduction to the 1961 edition by Susy Smith.

He isn't alone, for as this book shows over and over, even researchers that wish that there was no survival after death, who can see no logical reason for it, have been forced to conclude on the basis of the evidence that it is a fact. In his introduction to this second edition the author points out that after rereading his work he is more struck than ever by the consistency of the evidence. Case after case reveals a consistent pattern. All I can say is that after rereading it after five years, I still think that it is one of the best-written, most comprehensive books on the subject.<br /><br />_There is an incredible amount of evidence packed into this book. Swedenborg and Steiner (two scientific converts) are examined early on. They keep popping up since there is so much independent verification of their teachings by others. The entire 19th century phenomenon of Spiritualism is carefully reexamined (the Fox sisters, Daniel David Hume, Andrew Jackson Davis, etc.) Then the history and files of the Society for Psychical Research are also covered. This is also true for the Theosophical Society. This continues on to modern day research in out-of-body phenomenon and the near death experience. Actually, there is just so much information here, much of which even I was unfamiliar with, that this list doesn't do it justice. Some might say that he is just rehashing the old material. NO, that is not the case- he is re-examining the old material with a fresh and objective eye. You will be surprised at how much you thought you knew about these cases that is just plain wrong.<br /><br />_The evidence presented in this book should convince any reasonable person.<br /><br />\\"I didn't say it was possible- I said it was true.\\" Sir William Crookes	2005-09-27

Books	5	2	2	N	N	The Universe is full of unreasonable things...	_This is a novelization of the \\"Seeds of Doom\\" episode with Tom Baker (the fourth incarnation of the Doctor.) I hadn't seen that episode in years but in reading the story I could see it perfectly in my mind's eye- there was nothing added nor missing from the original. The wit, and madness, of the good Doctor truly came across.<br /><br />_As for the story itself, it is a cross between \\"The Thing from another World\\" and something out of H.P. Lovecraft. The action starts out at a science outpost in the Antarctic and moves to a great stately mansion in the English countryside. The action doesn't slacken for an instant.<br /><br />_The introduction by Harlan Ellison is especially good. He really \\"got\\" the true character of the Doctor. After all, this is a Time Lord who refused to stand by as a passive, objective observer like the rest of his kind. Instead, he commandeered an old Mk.40 TARDIS and set out on a crusade to protect the weak and innocent from the monstrous and evil. In short, this is The Doctor.	2005-09-26

Books	5	5	5	N	N	Jam-Packed with Fresh Cases	_I admit that I originally bought this book simply because I tend to buy every volume of synchronicity stories that I can find. I certainly wasn't familiar with the Australian author. Having now read it, I can attest that it is the largest collection of fresh cases that I've found in years. This is a gold mine if, like me, you are fascinated by meaningful coincidence.<br /><br />_The core of the book is seven chapters of coincidence files that were sent to the author from all around the world. I have found no overlap here with other published collections. You have case after case, which range from one paragraph to several pages depending on the order and complexity.<br /><br />_However, this book isn't just a collection of individual cases. The first section deals with how to refine and raise one's awareness of synchronicity in their life- without abandoning objectivity. This includes journal keeping to see patterns that would normally go unrecognized. Not only that, but there are chapters on how synchronicity relates to intuition, morphic resonance, probability, numinous numbers, the clustering effect, astrology, time, miracles, same names, and chance encounters. All of these are illustrated with numerous appropriate examples.<br /><br />_The author also includes a detailed study of the uncanny coincidences between the Lincoln and Kennedy assassinations as an appendix.<br /><br />_A second appendix is a scholarly study of psychology and coincidences by Dr. Caroline Watt. This seems to be provided to balance things out in terms of objectivity- yet even this critic finds that there are cases that cannot simply be explained away by chance and selective attention.<br /><br />_This book is both a first rate introduction to the subject, as well as, a treasure trove of new cases for those already fascinated by the subject.	2005-09-26

I really identified with the opening of this story- a teacher with a science degree driving back from a failed interview for a research scientist position finds himself swept into adventure beyond his wildest dreams. Turns out that not getting that job was the best thing that ever happened to Ian Chesterton.<br /><br />_It is fitting that this very first Doctor Who novelization is the one that links his fate with that of the Daleks and their home world of Skaros. It is the Doctor's instinctual opposition to these inconceivably evil obominations that immediately defines him for what he is. This is THE DOCTOR, the cosmic foe of all that is monstrous and evil. This is the Time Lord who saw the suffering and injustice in the universe and refused to remain a detached, objective observer like the rest of his kind.<br /><br />_And so the good doctor, his grand daughter Susan, her tutor Barbara Wright, and Ian Chesterton start on their adventures.<br /><br />_It seems to me that the Doctor need not have dispaired that there was no force in the universe looking out for the weak, the helpless, the innocent. Afterall, SOMETHING seems to guide that unsteerable old Mk.40 TARDIS to exactly where and when it is needed most....	2005-09-24

This well organised and truly encyclopedic guide is clearly worthy of his endorsement. In over a decade of personal research, this is the best single reference work on death and the afterlife that I've found. All the entries are well written, professional, and scholarly. Indeed, just by browsing through this thick volume you begin to see connections between subjects that may never have occured to you before (such as between shamanism and the mystery religions.) The highest praise that I can give this book is that it contained a sizable amount of information that even I wasn't familiar with- definately worth investing in for your library.<br /><br />_After all, what subject is ultimately of greater importance?	2005-09-22

Heck, I could commute....<br /><br />_There is also so much more that is pure Simak here- drinking moonshine with an educated neanderthal, a domesticated ghost, and a cloned saber-tooth tiger, for instance. Of course there is also the idea of reservations for the Little Folk (fairies, goblins, trolls, banshees, etc.) Then combine it all with commonplace instersteller travel by matter transmitter throughout a vast galactic community of intelligent aliens. All this is just the incidental setting for the main plot, which just happens to be very well crafted mystery story.<br /><br />_I believe that I have read just about everything that Clifford Simak ever published, and I would have to say that this little novel is probably my all time favorite.

I had thoroughly \\"gotten into\\" the first two volumes of this trilogy, _Loop's Progress_ and _Experiments with Life and Deaf_, at a point in my life where I identified with the characters- especially with the main character, Jarvis Loop. You see, Jarvis is a garbage man and an intellectual. That isn't unusual though, for the entire world that Jarvis moves through is one of working class bohemians, intellectuals, and mystics. That is what gives it its surrealistic tone, for everyone here is far more than you would ever assume to be living in a working class neighborhood in Erie, Pennsylvania in the 60's- and for me that was refreshing. When I was a kid I wanted to believe that the average people around me were living rich intellectual and artistic lives behind closed doors- that there must be more to them than normally met the eye and ear...<br /><br />This is a place where street gangs of philosophers debate the nature of the universe for years on end while playing cards in attics, where the dead have a disturbing habit of casually crossing the veil between the worlds, where spaceships and submarines are built in basements, where religious statuary routinely moves of its own accord, and even Jarvis' borderline psychotic father takes a year to read and comprehend 200 great books- just to prove that he can. There is a story sandwiched into one of the chapters about a City of Light and a City of Dark that reads like a gnostic creation myth. But there is also so much more going on here in this metaphorical, existentialist, nihilistic, surrealistic stew. At the very least, this trilogy is so unlike almost everything else that you've read that at least you will not be bored. There is just so much here- all of it playing off of each other until the result is a gestalt greater than the sum of the parts alone.	2005-09-21

This strip ran exclusively in the old New York Sunday News from 1952 to 1955. It was far ahead of its time- and one of the best hard science fiction strips ever published. The writer was science fiction pioneer Jack Williamson, and the artist, Lee Elias. Elias had also worked on Terry and the Pirates and he carried over the same highly detailed style into this strip. Volume one has a nice introduction written by Williamson on the history of project.<br /><br />_The strip itself centered around the main character of Mike Flint, licensed spatial engineer and free-lance pilot. Flint is headquartered on Brooklyn Rock, in the new frontier of the asteroid belt- in the year 2191. In fact, the entire strip has the feeling of the excitement of a new, booming frontier- full of post-war optimism for a bright scientific future. Indeed, the freshness of the strip really holds up- it is hard to believe that it ran half a century ago.<br /><br />_An interesting feature is the \\"Space Guard\\" introduced in this series. You can see where it originated from Williamson's \\"Space Legion\\" (a boyhood favorite of Asimov's.) It is also obviously the inspiration for Elias' excellent later work on \\"Tommy Tomorrow and the Planeteers\\" for D.C. comics.<br /><br />_Both volumes are printed in black and white except for the excellent cover art.

It is probably also the best introduction to the true nature of angels. This is only to be expected since Swedenborg spent 27 years of continuous communication and learning with angels and spirits. That is where the teachings come from.<br /><br />_Swedenborg held that all angels started life as human beings. Indeed all human beings are foremost spiritual beings- spiritual beings that subconsciously (and occasionally consciously) intersect with both the physical (neuro-conscious) and spiritual worlds. After death, this spirit is freed from the physical body to eventually become either an angel or hellish entity.<br /><br />_Indeed, his model of existence was that our physical world interfaces with a spiritual world, as well as heaven and hell. The intermediate spiritual world was a place where spirits sorted out whether they belonged in heaven or hell for themselves based on their own natural affinity. Part of this natural affinity is determined by the character that we build on earth through making hard choices. However, those hard choices are frequently guided by the nudges of angels- if we are receptive to such guidance. By the way, we only draw the attention of angels if our motivations are truly unselfish and heartfelt- otherwise there is a vast array of lower spirits that may answer our call.<br /><br />_There is comforting satisfaction to the underlying principle of the necessity of human freedom. Without free will there would be no point to existence. We must decide on our own to build personal characters worthy of being God's helpers. That is why life is set up so that, for most, there is no direct revelation of the existence of the Divine. It would impel people to obey or believe, and there by short-circuit free will. Angels and evil spirits can only offer hints and nudges in most circumstances. However, all power, all existence, flows from God. All the evil spirits in existence are failures- and cannot equal the power of one angel (whose power flows directly from God.)<br /><br />_Then there is also the idea of correspondence- or that all things have their ultimate reality in the spiritual world and not vice versa. Every physical object represents a spiritual one, though sometimes the relationship may not be immediately clear.<br /><br />_While it is true that Swedenborg's revelation did not include reincarnation, his intermediate spiritual world with its interpenetration of the physical world seems to fulfill the same role. It also seems to correspond with the concept of purgatory.<br /><br />So, if the immense size of such works as _Heaven and Hell_ or the complete 30 volume collected works have made you despair of ever comprehending Swedenborg, then try this book. It is truly remarkable how much meaning is packed in 112 pages (including the excellent illustrations by John Flaxman.)d.

While I consider myself competent and blessed at Tarot, the I Ching, Runes, Numerology, Astrology, and Dream interpretation, there are subjects here that I am not comfortable or expert at. However, based on the subjects that I know, it appears that the basics are covered competently in most.<br /><br />_Specifically the book provides short, basic chapters on: Pendulums and Dowsing, Numerology, Domino Divination, Dice Divination, Astromancy, the I Ching, the Tarot, Palmistry, Scrying (crystal ball, sand-pattern, tea leaves, sea shells, liqueur, smoke, and candle wax), and Dreams. As I said before, all you are going to get is the most basic information- a place to start. However, if you have only one reference book on divination, this could serve.<br /><br />_The introductory and closing chapters show the proper motivation of the authors. They believe in an Ultimate Deity. Plus their concept of progressive reincarnation is quite accurate (passing through the barrier between the earth plane and the god plane through birth and death in order to gain and assimilate knowledge and experience.)  It is also emphasized that interference in subject's lives is forbidden.<br /><br />_A few things that I found problems with were what they refer to as \\"Astromancy.\\" As a classically trained astrologer I do not quite see the legitimacy of what they describing here. Also, I noticed that in the extensive scrying section, the oldest method of all, the speculum or mirror, seems to be ignored. But most of all, I wish that the authors would have emphasized the importance of prayer and purification before approaching any sort of reading- you need protection and guidance when opening yourself up to this sort of thing.	2005-09-18

That is because the magic continues undiluted in this volume. This is literally a dream between two covers. So much of what was introduced with promise in Book One is more fully expanded here. I just can't get over the vividness of the images presented in both prose and illustration. This is a book that will literally make you dream in color....<br /><br />_Just in case you aren't familiar with the story so far, this is the tale of Candy Quackenbush from a dysfunctional little family in a dysfunctional little town called Chickentown, Minnesota. Candy is drawn into a fantastic new world of adventure and strangeness called the Abarat. Yet, as strange as this world is, it also seems more and more familiar to her....<br /><br />_By the way, if you think that not too much of importance will happen in the second volume of a four volume series, you would be wrong- dead wrong. As a matter of fact, so many important characters died in this book that I briefly wondered if there would be a volume three. The conclusion is so operatically spectacular that I cannot imagine Barker topping it when he concludes the series.<br /><br />_The author also further develops the metaphysics of his vision here. From what I can tell his inspiration is primarily drawn from Plato. Actually, the Abarat comes across as one of the infinite levels of the astral plane- but one that is coming unglued and increasingly under the influence of dark forces. In any case, I found it a satisfying vision.<br /><br />_Like the original volume this book is a top quality production in every respect: illustrations, typesetting, paper quality, end papers, covers, dust cover, etc., etc., etc.	2005-08-23

While part five, \\"Mystics and Teachers\\", explains individual teachers and movements of modern times: Swedenborg, Blavatsky, Steiner, De Lubicz, Gurdjieff, and Guenon.<br /><br />_Once again, this is no superficial spiritual smorgasbord- having these teachings laid out in a historical sequence actually helps to sense the \\"golden thread\\" that connects all genuine spiritual paths.

Perhaps embroidered visions would be closer to the truth. Afterall, he points out that to value waking reality more than dream is a \\"superstition\\" that he has come to reject. For as you accompany the author through the fantastic landscapes and cities of this quest they come to seem more and more real, more and more familiar.

When it first found its way into my hand I was quite frankly totally read out. I had read far too much recently and the last thing that I wanted to do was start a thick new novel- and the beginning of a series at that. Then I started to flip through it looking at the illustrations. There must have been at least a hundred of them (I've never seen a novel so well and lusciously illustrated)- and they were all so incredibly vibrant and... interesting. I still can't get that image of the lost lighthouse in the midst of the prairie out of my mind's eye. Then I started to read the first page, then the second, and the third.... I had finished by the second day- but I had placed an order for the next volume long before that.<br /><br />_This story of Candy Quakenbush is a rare thing. It bridges the gap between worlds. It takes you from the hateful reality of a dysfunctional family in Chickentown, Minnesota to the indescribable wonders of the Islands of the Abarat. And yet Barker does describe them so well that they seem as familiar to you as they come to seem to Candy (or at least thy do to me.) But then again, the introductory verse tells us of  the author's dream of a limitless book, of new heavens, new states, and of new souls- and how one of these souls used his hand to set them down. Perhaps that is why this book can seem like an experience in lucid dreaming. You never know if the Islands are a new plane of existence, a new dimension... or a dream. However the Abarat must have been gestating in the author's mind for quite some time, for in it I recognize the shoals of Quiddity and the dreaming sea of his earlier works.<br /><br />_This is no more exclusively a \\"children's book\\" than is Harry Potter.<br /><br />_If you are going to experience this book, then you really should read the hardcover edition.

Perhaps this is because Pythagoras was the original western gateway of the perennial philosophy to the West (he had studied with the first of the Ionian philosophers, the Egyptian priests, the Persian Magi, and the initiates of the Hellenic Mysteries.) One of his closest disciples was even a Celtic sage. In any case, the concepts of the immortality and transmigration of the soul, spiritual evolution, the inherent value of Truth and Justice, good stewardship of community resources for the benefit of all, a Golden Mean to all things, seeking harmony with the Divine, divination and the higher meaning of numbers, the brotherhood of all humans through the sharing of a single greater body and soul- all these concepts seem like they have always been a part of me. But, above all, there was the manner that the Philosopher (he first coined the term) found no contradiction between the rational and the mystical. He was great enough to encompass both without contradiction.<br /><br />_This is a well-written and designed introduction to Pythagoras and his teachings. It is divided into four main parts: The Quest for Knowledge (his early years), The Teachings, The Decline of the Pythagorean School, and The Golden Verses. There is no exegesis to the Verses so the reader may like to refer to the work of Olivet after reading them (there are at least two distinct levels of understanding to them.) There are numerous useful illustrations and diagrams, as well as a bibliography for further study. The footnotes are included in an appendix in the back. This isn't the most exhaustive scholarly study of the subject, but it is a very readable and perceptive introduction for the general student. It will remain in my permanent library.<br /><br />_You can't help but find the death of the Philosopher to be especially tragic. After so many years of trying to enlighten the world, he died in exile because of the corrupt connivance of oligarchs and militarists. Yet still his light shines on through the ages- for it is the true soul of the West.Philosopher to be especially tragic.

Such things are of value only if they are obtained in the pursuit of the highest Good. This highest Good is demonstrated to be God. Moreover, Boethius points out that when evil men succeed in obtaining such goals over the righteous, then they cease to truly be men- they are beasts and subhuman. This is a refreshing reminder in the modern world, a world not unlike that of late Roman times.<br /><br />_All happiness, all worth, all reason for being, lies in the One and the Good. Even when we commit immoral acts, it is a result of ignorance on our part in seeking this ultimate goal. Indeed, to turn from the quest of finding the One is to cease to exist at any meaningful level. There is no \\"fire and brimstone\\", or talk of eternal torment in hell here. There doesn't need to be. As long as you willfully or ignorantly stray from the Path then you are in hell. And to not find reconnection with the One and the Good is to cease to exist. All of our earthly existence is for the purpose of reawakening to our true nature. This truth lies within all of us and it is only reached by personal introspection (Know thyself.) Only in this way will we return to the eternal Source that lies beyond time itself.<br /><br />_The consolation of the Consolatio lies in the fact that suffering serves a purpose if it puts us back on the true Path. Moreover, earthly recognition of virtue is irrelevent. God always recognises the man of virtue if the masses do not.	2005-07-31

It was even more of a surprise to find that the novel was written in 1935. It was a further surprise to find that it was written by a newspaperman that had served as an enlisted man in the old 15th Infantry in China back before WWII. Finally, it was a surprise that I actually liked this little book even more than the film.<br /><br />_The story centers around the most unusual circus of Dr. Lao. The good doctor's circus is his own personal world- and seems to obey no laws of man or nature but his own (and that of his junior partner, Apollonius of Tyana.) This is an appropriate partnership, for Apollonius was perhaps the wisest man of the classical West, while Lao, if I am not mistaken, is patterned on Lao Tzu, wisest man of the classical East. Between them, they have assembled a remarkable collection of creatures from all places and times for their little show: a Chimera, a Unicorn, a Sphinx, a Sea Serpent, a mermaid, a werewolf, a hedge hound, the Golden Ass, a medusa, a satyr, a faun, nymphs, a Roc, and much, much more. All of this for the edification of the inhabitants of the sleepy, ordinary, little town of Abalone, Arizona during one hot, dusty August during the Great Depression. Everything is intended to wake the little town from its slumber, for everything reflects the great dance of life in all its appetite and lust, its wonder and terror. Yet, above it all, and in control of it all, are the two great sages.<br /><br />_Many of the inhabitants of Abalone are left in wonder or in denial.

Coomaraswamy would have known.<br /><br />_Guenon points out that the Vedanta is neither religion, nor is it a philosophy, in the Western sense. What is it then? It is a complete way of life. More than this, it is in and of itself, the totality of existence. It is the true Metaphysic. You see, Western thinking always categorizes and systematizes. It views what it studies from outside- and manages to sterilize and kill it. This is why the western man finds it so easy to put aside his \\"religion\\" and \\"philosophy\\" when comes the opportunity for exploitation and war. You cannot put aside the Vedanta, for it is the totality of existence- including you. It is Reality. And the farther you separate yourself from it, the less \\"real\\" you become. The end result of a profane society is a world of shadow with no real substance at all.<br /><br />_The goal of the Vedanta is unity with the Universal. You seek alignment with that which was before all else. More specifically you seek to realize this union consciously, for you, and everything and every being, emanated from this Source. You still contain a Divine spark or seed at the core of your being. You realize this with your heart through Intuition and not through your brain and its lesser form of knowing. The more you rely on the brain and its elaborate ego constructs the farther you stray from the Ultimate Source and Goal.<br /><br />_There are many subtle variations on finding the path back- many schools of Yoga. Just remember, in all of them Yoga still means \\"Union\\"- the goal is the same. To reach it is to rise above caste through transcendence.<br /><br />_If you are already familiar with the teachings of Taoism, Neo-Platonism, or Hermetism then you will digest this study more readily. This is because these other branches of tradition drew from the original Tradition expressed first by the Vedanta.<br /><br />_Anyone that attempts to use the Tradition for profane and veiled ends that ignore the inherent divinity within all beings will no doubt deserve what they will inevitably get.<br /><br />_Note: The translator's name is Richard C.

This is a tale for anyone who has been labeled as \\"different\\" and who has sought to find a place where they might fit in. In this case it is Tod and his pet pig, Otto, from- you guessed it- Kansas. Tod is an orphan, an honors student, a hard worker, and just a plain nice guy. Unfortunately, he has also been labeled as gay. As a result his life isn't worth spit in small-town Midwestern America. Fortunately, everything changes for our hero when a tornado rips through town and drops his Airstream motor home on top of his hateful, homophobic Aunt Eunice. This isn't the only improbable death associated with Tod, for his mother spontaneously combusted, and his father died of an allergic reaction to talcum while changing him. The towns people also notice this chain of unfortunate events and offer to fix Tod's motor home for free- on the condition that he get in it and just keep going.<br /><br /> Along the way, our hero meets up with a strange, but somehow familiar, caste of well-developed characters (yes, they are caricatures, but they are caricatures that turn out to have real depth.) First, there is Fif, the awkward patchwork girl who was beaten up by the local football team and tied to a pole in a cornfield because of her ambiguous sexuality. Then, there is Sinjin, an ex-special forces cyborg that is now more machine than man- and who craves a human heart so that he might once again feel human emotion. Oh yes, there is also Percy the Lion- a self-hating violent homophobic closet-case who lacks the courage to face up to his true nature. Tod recognizes that he was somehow meant to meet up with all these \\"freqs\\" (people who are on a different frequency from the society around them.) So he invites them all to travel with him to the fabulous and legendary New Zirconium City, where surely all of their dreams will come true....<br /><br /> This is a truly clever and original updating of Baum's The Wizard of Oz, but told as if in collaboration with Charles Busch and William Burroughs. I don't see it as a satire of the original, since the original moral is still intact. And it is a moral worth repeating in these dark times, that in a world of repression, conformity, and intolerance there is still hope for the underground of those who are different- the outsiders.<br /><br /> There is another reason why I liked this book.

I remember when there were out-of-the-way clubs and districts where \\"alternative people\\" could meet and unwind (gays, bohemians, artists, intellectuals, pagans, underworld types, street people, etc.) Such places seem to have evaporated under the current atmosphere of social and political oppression- and, yes, you could legitimately call it fascist.

What this book is, is an attack on false, literalist dogma that has so dangerously distorted the true Reality of God for so much of Western history. Let me say that I read the authors' first two books on this subject (more than once), and this third volume is a more than worthy culmination.<br /><br />_The first half solidly deconstructs and demolishes any claim to historical accuracy or legitimacy for the Holy Books of the Jewish, Christian, and Moslem religious traditions. All Holy Books are the work of men, not of God (including Gnostic books, but Gnostics realize this.) Personally, while I was aware of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian sources in the Tanakh, I was amazed to find that it appears to have been compiled as late as the first century BCE- and by the Maccabees in order to justify a rule so ruthless that it would put the Taliban to shame. Nor did I realize that the Romans were actually allies of the Maccabees against their Syrian Greek foes (which explains much in terms of creating a false religion and history for political ends.) An excellent case is also made for the origin of monotheism among the Greeks and not the Jews (read your Heraclitus, Pythagoras, and Plato.)  It is also this first half that emphasizes the difference between the Gnostic and Literalist traditions. The Gnostic is the true and original Christian (or pre-Christian) who sees in Jesus the allegorical ideal of man awakening to his true origin and nature. The Literalist is one who bullies everyone into blind belief in dogmas that obstruct and distort true experience of God. There is an excellent table that spells out the specific differences between the two. As for the critique of Islam, well, how could a copy of a copy of a bad original be anything less than the worst of them all...?<br /><br />_The second half of the book deals with the nature and obtainment of Gnosis. The authors' model holds that Gnosis is a natural state akin to lucid dreaming (dreaming, yet consciously recognizing that you are dreaming.) You experience a shift in consciousness and perspective. Your ordinary world and life does not disappear as you enter some new supernatural state or dimension. No, but your consciousness expands to the point that you realize that your old everyday life, including the your old sense of self, is not the totality of existence. You realize that you are part of a greater \\"life-dreamer\\" which is dreaming both itself, as well as, everyone and everything. You realize that we are all part of this great dreamer and are all connected at this higher level. We are all One. The purpose of life is to awaken and personally experience to this knowledge- this Gnosis. This section of the book points the way.<br /><br />_Having first touched upon the Gnosis over a dozen years ago, I like to think that I possess an intuition when it comes to teachings on the subject. I am not saying that reading this book will get you to the ultimate goal, but it will put you on the right path. It will plant the genuine seeds that will burst forth from dreaming unconscious.thors' model holds that Gnosis is a natural state akin to lucid dreaming (dreaming, yet consciously recognizing that you are dreaming.)

This is better, besides the psychological terror that builds, you have cosmically mind boggling themes of infinite time and space- and the world beyond this world, of which ours is but a pale inferior shadow.<br /><br />_I often wonder just who William Hope Hodgeson was. He was plainly a man of action, that much is clear from his battle with the pig demons, but he was also something more. I wonder what forgotten corner of the Empire he picked up his knowlege of things cosmic and beyond the veil....	2005-07-10

I also cannot believe that it was originally published in 1907. This is because it combines two of my favorite life-long interests: realistic sea stories and weird monster tales. In fact, this book reads like C.S. Forester meets H.P. Lovecraft. Or perhaps it is more like _Mysterious Island_ meets _At the Mountains of Madness_. In any case, I loved it.<br /><br />_Not only is the narrative tight and well crafted, but the technical details are fascinating and accurate. The old fashion style is charming. No one speaks English that perfectly anymore- not even the English. Plus, you can really tell that the author was a merchant seaman in the last days of sail. As for the story itself, it is set in 1757- one hundred and fifty years into the author's past. It is the tale of the strange adventures of the surviving crew of the good ship Glen Carrig after she rips her bottom out on an uncharted rock- and they have to take to the boats. Yet, that rock was the least of the unknowns to put them in peril. They happen first on the unearthly \\"Land of Lonesomeness\\" and its otherworldly denizens. Yet, this is only a practice run for the living hell and stark terror of the \\"Continent of Weed.\\" This appears to be the first use of the Sargasso Sea in a horror story. And Hodgson must have actually been there, for he got too many details right- like the tiny little craps that infest the weed.<br /><br />_If you like this story, then seek out the author's _The House on the Borderland_. It is even more like Lovecraft- but written long before.	2005-07-10

The thing that struck me first about it was that the author \\"Magus Incognito\\" was well versed in classical 19th century Theosophy. In fact much of this book could have come out of a mail order Theosophy course- I know, I've taken such courses. However, there is just enough additional hermetic, gnostic, and alchemical information to make it just a little more. There is nothing really incorrect here, it is just that it is rather basic and sparse when compared to works such as _The Secret Doctrine_ or _Isis Unveiled_. Still, if you are looking for an introduction or review of metaphysical basics this little book will serve.<br /><br />_There is a section on Bucke's _Cosmic Consciousness_ that at least shows that the author was cognizant of the state, even if you are left largely on your own as to how to reach it. You see, that's the core of it- how to quiet, or shatter, the everyday ego so that a breakthrough can be made. Before this, much of the teaching in this book will appear incomprehensible or foolishness. Afterwards, it is self-explanatory and merely serves to validate the breakthrough. Still, to be fair, the author does emphasize the idea that \\"When the student is ready, the Master appears.\\"<br /><br />_From what I have learned of Rosicrucians and Rosicrucian affiliated Freemasonry through out the 18th and 19th century this could pass for \\"authentic\\" teachings. \\"Magus Incognito\\" sounds exactly like a secret name or grade from one of these old lodges. You see, the knowledge possessed by most of these groups tended to be pretty rudimentary. For the most part they recycled the hermetica, basic alchemy, and the mysticism of Jacob Bohme. In light of this, you probably have more \\"secrets\\" here than most of these old lodges ever possessed.<br /><br />_Still, if you define Rosicrucianism as a gnostically inspired spiritual movement that had as its goal reunion of the human spirit with the Divine, then this could be considered as genuine Rosicrucianism.<br /><br />_If I were to attempt to explain why this book remains in print, it would be because it is in public domain with an anonymous author.

The former is characterized by access to visionary realms of consciousness, the latter by the theatrics of deception. A true shaman travels to the other worlds (both higher and lower) to bargain or battle for the good of others, or the good of all.<br /><br />_I greatly admired the author's earlier book _The Shaman and the Magician_ in which he made a compelling case for a legitimate connection between traditional shamanism and western magical practices. In that book he demonstrated that the \\"rising in the planes\\" and path working of the western magus is of a similar nature, if not originally rooted in, the shaman's journey. This current book restates and expands upon that theme.<br /><br />_Part One of this work is entitled Pathways in Magic. It is one of the best, straight forward, and comprehensive descriptions of traditional shamanism. Many traditions are touched upon: North America, Mexico, South America, Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia, Eastern Asia and the Orient, etc. He captures the underlying cosmology, symbolism, ritual, and guides. You find yourself beginning to enter upon the unique mind-set of the shaman. In this first section he also covers hallucinogenic plants (which he holds are by no means essential to shamanic practice.) Since he includes tobacco in the pharmacopoeia (and I do like an occasional pipe) I will withhold further comment.<br /><br />_Part Two brings in the mythology and symbolism of western magic. Here, from the start, we are shown that the Axis Mundi of the Magus, and the Cosmic Tree of the shaman, are one in the same. We are introduced to the basic principles of Kabbalah, as well as, the high ceremonial magic of the Golden Dawn. Between the two, you can see the hermetic, gnostic, yogic fusion behind the traditions. Then he adds such other offshoots as the Enochian system (Dee), the Magic of Atavistic Resurgence (Spare), D.O.M.E. Meditation (Steinbrecher), etc.<br /><br />_Part Three concentrates on the vision quest. This is a highly personal account of the author's own experiences. The technique favored is that of visionary magic centered on Kabbalistic Tree of Life and Tarot symbolism. However, there is an entire section devoted to Michael Harner's famous workshop technique.<br /><br />_All-in-all I find this book an effective and refreshing refutation of the narrow-minded idea that the fusion of too many spiritual traditions is, somehow, no traditional at all. Anyone who holds to such a view knows nothing of the history spiritual and magical traditions in the East, or in the esoteric West. There is a common perennial wisdom that connects all true esoteric traditions of worth down through out the ages and throughout the world.<br /><br />_The appendix gives an extensive section on music for magical visualization. It also includes a brief section of shamanic and magical organizations (though I have always found the true shaman's path to be necessarily solitary.)

They're hitting us everywhere! And they take no prisoners... It's Total War!\\"<br /><br />The M.A.R.S. Patrol series of comic books done by Wally Wood for Gold Key Comics are a guilty pleasure of mine. To understand their appeal you have to understand the time that they were conceived and written in- the mid-60's. Back then, before Vietnam, the U.S. Armed forces could do no wrong. We were the defenders of the underdog- the good guys that never lost a war. Even the favorite toys of little children were war toys- G.I. Joes, Marx Battleground play sets, Hasbro Tommy Guns...<br /><br />What made this series different was its hard edge. Right from the start (0200 Hours on July 5th 1965) the Invaders came out of the sea at Atlantic City, New Jersey, killing everything in their path- men, women, children. This was Total War. For the first time since 1812 the United States of America was fighting for its life on its own soil. We didn't know it then, but the same scenario was playing out all around the world (Moscow, Calcutta, Hong Kong etc.) No one knew who the Invaders were or their place of origin, but it was up to America to take the lead in driving them back to where ever they came from.<br /><br />That is where the new M.A.R.S. units came in. These Marine Combat Teams were intended to be a cross between \\"commandos, paratroops, and guerrillas.\\" Each man was a specialist- combat pilot, armor specialist, demolition, underwater operations, etc. These teams were both our first defense and the tip of the spearhead- trained to meet any challenge, anytime, anywhere- with or without support and reinforcement.<br /><br />The technical detail in these books was especially good. You had such realistic hardware as the OV-10 Bronco and the F-104 Interceptor (this latter plane was never part of the Marine inventory.) On the other hand, you had experimental vehicles like the Piasecki Flying Jeep (never got beyond the prototype stage) and one-man gyrocopters. And then you had inspired inventions such as laser tanks, unpiloted recon drones, and VERTOL jets. The one thing that was kind of irritating was that the infantry weapons seemed to be from WW2: Thompson sub-machine guns, BARS, water-jacketed Browning machine guns, and the old M-6 Bazooka. They did fix this later in the series by introducing the \\"new\\" M-14 and M-79 grenade launcher.<br /><br />One thing that never did sit right was the \\"color coded\\" combat uniforms. I suppose the team members with the forest green and navy blue uniforms were all right, but God save the guys that got the bright yellow and orange uniforms and helmets. Of course, considering that the enemy wore bright purple uniforms, maybe they weren't at that great of comparative disadvantage....you had inspired inventions such as laser tanks, unpiloted recon drones, and VERTOL jets.

Don't get me wrong, I used to read the most graphic and disturbing of the old horror comics and magazines, but the Spectre was something different. On some level I knew that the ghouls, zombies, monsters and vampires in the other mags were make-believe, but the Spectre, well, he was the Old Testament Wrath of God. Even as a boy I knew that He was real....<br /><br />_I found these stories from the early forties were a joy to read. Some of the artwork from this period can be pretty crude by today's standards, but I was pleasantly surprised by co-creator Bernard Baily's drawing. Just about every panel is drawn to a competent standard. In fact there are images, backgrounds, and panel work that are clearly ahead of their time. Some of it borders on the surreal. Even the old over-heavy inking style tends to add rather than detract from the supernatural darkness of the story line. As for the color, it is bright, garish- and perfectly done for stories of this era. I know that many people have a problem with the costume design of the classic Spectre, but for me it works perfectly. The character looks like a fish-white corpse in a shroud- which I remember is one of the things that helped to creep me out as a kid.<br /><br />_However, it was Siegel's writing that makes the character. Here is a spirit sent back to earth to battle crime and uphold justice- until it is totally obliterated from earth. I didn't realize it, but Spectre was called back to the gates of eternity early in his mission because \\"the Voice\\" who assigned him his mission decided that it was too much for one man. Yet, in order to return to earth to save an innocent life, Jim Corrigan refused eternal rest to return to earth to fight evil for eternity. No longer strictly human- and barred from heaven for eternity- by his own choice to protect the innocent. That sums up the isolation and nobility of the character. As for \\"harshness\\" of the techniques that the character uses against the wicked, well, these are the most sociopathic of the old-style gangsters. Nothing less would be justice- and the Spectre as a mind reader knows exactly what these monsters did- and why. One other thing- in the very first story Jim Corrigan goes into the \\"streaming light\\" to encounter a Higher Force at the gates of eternity that sends him back because his mission on earth is unfinished. This was in 1940- long before near-death experiences had been popularized...<br /><br />_The book itself is a thing of beauty with its black leatherette finish; heavy, glossy paper; and high quality printing.

Such things are of value only if they are obtained in the pursuit of the highest Good. This highest Good is demonstrated to be God. Moreover, Boethius points out that when evil men succeed in obtaining such goals over the righteous, then they cease to truly be men- they are beasts and subhuman. This is a refreshing reminder in the modern world, a world not unlike that of late Roman times.<br /><br />_All happiness, all worth, all reason for being, lies in the One and the Good. Even when we commit immoral acts, it is a result of ignorance on our part in seeking this ultimate goal. Indeed, to turn from the quest of finding the One is to cease to exist at any meaningful level. There is no \\"fire and brimstone\\", or talk of eternal torment in hell here. There doesn't need to be. As long as you willfully or ignorantly stray from the Path then you are in hell. And to not find reconnection with the One and the Good is to cease to exist. All of our earthly existence is for the purpose of reawakening to our true nature. This truth lies within all of us and it is only reached by personal introspection (Know thyself.) Only in this way will we return to the eternal Source that lies beyond time itself.<br /><br />_The consolation of the Consolatio lies in the fact that suffering serves a purpose if it puts us back on the true Path. Moreover, earthly recognition of virtue is irrelevent. God always recognises the man of virtue if the masses do not.	2005-06-30

The material that has been abridged was largely unnecessary, repetitious, and unreadable to the modern reader. The translation was based on the Teubner text of C.L. Kayser. There are three pages of very useful maps included in the front of the book.<br /><br />_In the introduction to the main text, the author perceptively points out much of the historical and social environment during which it was written. He emphasizes that it may not be very accurate considering that it was completed in C.E. 220, while Apollonius was generally thought to have left this world around C.E. 98. He also reveals that Philostratus wrote this work under the direction of the empress Julia Domna as part of her famed intellectual circle. It is pointed out that this empress had tried to gain political influence of her own, and when that failed, had brought together a salon on renowned philosophers and writers to influence her society in a less direct way. My own take on this is that this circle invented Apollonius as an example of the \\"ideal spiritual and good man.\\" In a Roman world ruled increasingly by force, violence, and greed, this Apollonius would be the ideal role model. Indeed, that is what you encounter in the book, example after example of Apollonius encountering worldly and wicked men and setting them straight. It is still rather inspiring, even though you realize that this Apollonius is probably a composite character of many philosophical and religious characters of the classical world. This is not to categorically state that there was no original, Pythagorean, named Apollonius that served as the original inspiration- it is just that we do not know how much of the original is still there.<br /><br />_I would like to offer a further insight here. All three Flavian emperors are encountered by Apollonius in his travels. He takes special delight in seeing a remote vision of the assassination of the last emperor of this dynasty, Domitian. Now, being an imperial \\"insider\\" Julia Domna would have known that the Flavian family essentially created Christianity as a new cult to pacify the militant Jews of the first century. By her time, this new Christian cult had spread far outside of Judea and was beginning to threaten other established religions- including the imperial cults of the emperors. By being seen as the opponent of the Flavians, Apollonius was to be understood as the champion of tradition \\"pagan\\" cults and philosophy against the new religion. Apollonius is shown to be tolerant to other religions and faiths- something that Christianity, even then, was not. Perhaps his very name reflected this tolerance and defense of the traditional. This is also no doubt why he visits India during his travels, for even in those days the Vedic tradition was seen as the \\"root\\" of all religious tradition.<br /><br />_In any case, the account is still quite edifying in its depiction of what was considered the archetypical example of the good, just, and tolerant man in the late classical world.light in seeing a remote vision of the assassination of the last emperor of this dynasty, Domitian.

Specifically, in this application, it means knowledge leading to union with the divine.<br /><br />_I read the author's previous book on this subject through at least three times over the years. I found his idea of the gnosis extending through history to the modern day as both valid and inspiring. No matter how overpowering was the dogma and worldly power of the age, a true spiritual path survived in the background down through the ages. A Golden Thread linked these ages. That is also true in this book, for as the author points out, you can start reading at any of the fourteen chapters and still find the Center, for the chapters mirror each other. This is because where ever this thread intersects with an age, that is where the Center is- stringing seemingly disparate and profane history together on a necklace of higher wisdom. All through history has the gnosis flowed, through the Vedists, Kabbalists, Magi,  Neoplatonists, Hermeticists, Troubadours, Knights Templar, Cathars, through individual mystics, to modern day neo-gnostics.<br /><br />_This is no soulless, academic, encyclopedic compilation of gnostic terminology, the inherent meaning of the subject shines through. The meaning of true Gnosis as union with god, or rather, the Divine spark and origin in all of us is repeatedly expounded. Moreover, it is shown that this is why mankind is different from other beings. We come here from beyond to grow through suffering and hard moral choices- and to ultimately awake to our Divine origins. The ultimate reason and purpose of this is that unconscious God may ultimately come to know Himself as conscious God. That was set in place from the beginning.<br /><br />_One other small comment of my own on the gnostic concept of the lesser, deranged \\"creator god.\\" I am not at all sure that at least some of the gnostic writers weren't referring to the Romans here. It is well known that the imperial Romans engineered cults for the purpose of social and political control. The divinization and cults of the emperors are prime examples. They claimed to be gods, demanded worship, and set up false religions to achieve this- sounds like the evil, deranged, lesser god to me, or at least his microcosmic reflection....<br /><br />Oh yes, thanks to this book I now view the character and works of Aleister Crowley with considerably more sympathy and respect.<br /><br />_This is a thick book, but it is uniformly a joy to read.

This is not some wild and sensational account by a fanatic- it is the work of a gifted independent scholar of impeccable character.<br /><br />_First of all, why should we be surprised? The Flavians are known to have originated and supported other cults in the empire. The engineering of religions for the purpose of social control was a forte of the Romans. That's what the new Jesus cult was supposed to accomplish, it was to pacify the messianic Sicarii movement among the Jews with messages like \\"turn the other cheek\\", \\"give unto Caesar what is Caesar's\\", and to respect Roman officials, soldiers, and tax collectors. It was a religion that preached pacifism towards one's rightful rulers- which is how it is still most often used today.<br /><br />_Moreover, the parallels between \\"Jesus'\\" ministry and the military campaign to pacify Judea are just too close. Jesus was Titus Flavius. This meant that the stiff-necked Jewish rebels would be worshipping Caesar- something that they would rather die than knowingly submit to.<br /><br />_Some might find it strange that I would not be outraged by this book. The truth is, I've always had intuitive problems with the historical Jesus. My connection is with the cosmic Christ principle that long predated Roman-imposed dogma.<br /><br />_Upon reading this book I find that I have even less respect for literalist Christians and their social agenda, but I have much more respect for the orthodox Jews that never bowed to the Great Lie crafted for their benefit.<br /><br />_I predict that this book will come to eventually be recognised as the most important piece of religious scholarship of our age.	2005-06-13

Part four was published in two volumes (five and six), so this book is in reality two volumes bound as one. However, Frazier considered part four to be divided into three books (Adonis and Attis in volume one, and Osiris in volume two.) In any case, they are all here in this third edition- revised, enlarged, and unabridged.<br /><br />_This addition to the his great study deals primarily with the tradition of the god-man savior (i.e. the christs that predated Christ.) Throughout the Mediterranean world mystery religions arose that centered on the combined allegorical initiation myths of a lost and resurrected goddess and a dying and resurrecting god-man.<br /><br />_While Frazier does recognize the origination of these myths in connection with vegetation and seasonal cycles, he seems to miss the later symbolism of the higher mysteries- where such god-men represented the planting of the seed of divine consciousness into the world, its trials and struggles, and its return. This was the pattern that all initiates were to follow to awaken to their own origin, true nature, and purpose in life- namely that our spirit descends into earthly existence to grow through struggle and trial, reawaken to its heavenly and immortal nature, and transcend physical death to return to the ultimate source. Still, Frazier does a magnificent job of unearthing and reassembling all the details and interrelationships of the various cults, even if the deeper meaning seems to have eluded him.	2005-06-10

Coomaraswamy would have known.<br /><br />_Guenon points out that the Vedanta is neither religion, nor is it a philosophy, in the Western sense. What is it then? It is a complete way of life. More than this, it is in and of itself, the totality of existence. It is the true Metaphysic. You see, Western thinking always categorizes and systematizes. It views what it studies from outside- and manages to sterilize and kill it. This is why the western man finds it so easy to put aside his \\"religion\\" and \\"philosophy\\" when comes the opportunity for exploitation and war. You cannot put aside the Vedanta, for it is the totality of existence- including you. It is Reality. And the farther you separate yourself from it, the less \\"real\\" you become. The end result of a profane society is a world of shadow with no real substance at all.<br /><br />_The goal of the Vedanta is unity with the Universal. You seek alignment with that which was before all else. More specifically you seek to realize this union consciously, for you, and everything and every being, emanated from this Source. You still contain a Divine spark or seed at the core of your being. You realize this with your heart through Intuition and not through your brain and its lesser form of knowing.

Alot of hack writers have done war stories, adventure stories, and sea stories like these, but in L'Amour's case you know that he has actually been there, actually done that. I've read alot of this author's work over the years, but this is probably my favorite of his books.<br /><br />_Here is a working man that has actually travelled to the rough and wild places in these stories (and when they were much rougher and much wilder.) He has done the hard labor and endured the harder conditions. This is refreshing in a period when it seems that all working people are automatically assumed to be ignorant, if not stupid. Louis L'Amour was a working man that not only loved books the whole time he was working, wandering, and fighting, but he went on to become one of the best-selling authors of the 20th century.<br /><br />_It is funny, back when I first read this book, before I had done most of my own \\"yondering\\", I read them with a sense of awe, envy, and a grain of salt. Now, when I read them it is with a sense of recognition and validation. Yup, I recognise that situation, I recognise that character. He got it exactly right.

True, you can read it as a simple adventure story of life on a turn-of-the-century seal-hunting schooner, but it is far more than this. It is essentially the story of Wolf Larson- and Wolf Larson is the entire mainstream of 19th and 20th century America in microcosm.<br /><br />_Larson is no simple brute. He is, rather, a complex brute. He is a master of men and a master of the seas- but that is ALL that he is. Larson is an intelligent, driven, ruthless master of industry (in this case, seal hunting.) He has succeeded through his own abilities, hard work, and talent- or so he would have you believe. Truth is, brutal backstabbing, deception, exploitation, and disregard for the law has played an equal measure in his rise and dominance. You see, Larson believes in the rule of the jungle. He believes in it so much that he is driven to prove that this is all there is to existence. He must always seek to degrade and destroy anyone who seeks to rise above this state. This is also why he must disregard the possibility of the existence of a human soul. Larson is an intelligent, hard-nosed materialist that simply cannot conceive of anything beyond a social Darwinist hell of survival of the fittest. And Wolf Larson must be the fittest of them all. As much as money means to Wolf, it is really power over other beings- men and animals that means the most to him. Without this power to sadistically degrade and dominate others, the money would have no meaning. Ultimately that explains why he has risen to command his own vessel at all costs- he is a control freak that MUST be in absolute, totalitarian command of his whole world. This is why he only mans his ship with the lowest, most bestial types of human being, and does everything in his power to make them worse- not unlike many modern corporations. This is also why the sudden presence of a higher sort of individual, with ideals that transcend mere survival and materialism are so totally threatening to him.<br /><br />_There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave.<br /><br />_Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle. When he loses his sight and strength, the monsters that he has surrounded himself with turn on him. In the last measure there is nothing great about Larson after all, for in facing death he proves to be a petty, murdering, weakling that would rather take all those around him down with him. It seems that despite his grand pretensions, he was no Lucifer at all, but merely a sick, pathetic, sociopath incapable of making the leap into being truly human.ly threatening to him.  <br /> <br />_There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave. <br /> <br />_Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle.

These foldouts include a detailed cut-away view showing the interior layout of the vessel, additional descriptive views, sail plans (if applicable), actual photos (if the subject is still extant), and an excellent descriptive blurb. All details on the cut-away are numbered and indexed to a list of features. The historical range is from classical Rome to the modern age and includes primarily western warships. The ships described are as follows: Roman Trireme, Viking Longship, Royal Galley, Spanish Galleon, Vasa, Sovereign of the Seas, Victory, Santissima Trinidad, Constitution, Merrimac, Gloire, Warrior, Devastation, Andrea Doria, Maine, Holland VI, Guiseppi Garibaldi, Dreadnought, U9, Leonardo da Vinci, Queen Elizabeth, De Ruyter, Enterprise, Scharnhorst, Cossack, Tirpitz, Yamato, PT109, Iowa, Nautilus, Long Beach, Nimitz, Kirov, Ohio, Guiseppe Garbaldi, and Zeeleeuw.

First of all, why did they choose to include the Merrimac (Virginia) and not the revolutionary Monitor?

This is such a book. I am indebted to P.M.H. Atwater for citing it in her _We Live Forever_.<br /><br />_The first of the five parts of this volume deals with the true nature and structure of both the human body and the worlds in which it functions. The human being is a multi-dimensional entity composed of physical, bioplasmic (etherial), astral, mind (subconscious, conscious, superconscious), and soul bodies or levels. Above all, it is hammered home that the brain is not the mind.<br /><br />_The second section deals with the evidence of survival after physical death. Extremely good, succinct, descriptions are given of eleven types of evidence: 1) historical and religious writings, 2) death-bed, near-death, and out-of-body experiences, 3) apparitions, hauntings, and ghosts, 4) obsession and spirits, 5) spirit doctors, 6) spirit photographs, 7) materialism, 8) reincarnation, 9) space-time relationships, 10) conservation of matter and energy, and 11) communications through mediums and telepathic channels.<br /><br />_Part three gives detailed descriptions of the interpenetrating planes of existence: the physical plane; the low, middle, and high astral planes; the mental-causal planes, the celestial planes, the cosmic God Head, the end of manifest creation, the void of pure consciousness, Nirvana, and beyond.<br /><br />_ The fourth part gives 50 specific questions and answers to the system put forth. This includes the proven path for individual soul development (which agrees with the perennial philosophy and the core teachings of all the great religious founders.)<br /><br />_Now, part five gives some truly mind-boggling examples of communication with the dead via electronic instrumentation. I had read Sherman's work years ago, but this goes far, far beyond. The heart of the historic O'Neil-Mueller communication is included.<br /><br />_Not only did this book strike me as having the \\"ring of truth\\", but it verified so many of my own experiences and conclusions over the years. Perhaps that is why my \\"library angel\\" didn't point it out to me- it was to serve as independent verification.<br /><br />_By the way, there should be a large, full-color teaching poster included in the back that clearly outlines the planes of existence and their nature.

As the book points out, this is one of the largest, smoothest running tranportation systems in the world- maybe that is why it is so little noticed or appreciated. Yet, that makes it no less a maritime miracle. It is a matrix of locks, dams, and channels that creates an eighth sea that rises 600 feet from tidewater to heartland.<br /><br />_Don't worry about the information being too dated. It reflects the heyday of the fleet in the 70's. Most of these vessels are still in service and when it comes right down to it there hasn't been all that much new construction since then. There is a full secion of the great 1000 foot superlakers that were built during this period. The appendix gives a complete listing of the entire fleets of the U.S. Lake Carriers Association and Canadian Dominion Maritime Association up to the late seventies. It should be noted the many, many ocean going vessels of the world that ply the lakes are not listed.<br /><br />_The chapters on the history of Great Lakes shipping from schooners to whalebacks is especially fascinating. It is a pity that so few people know the saga of life on the lakes in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was truly an unique world of its own.<br /><br />_This book is very well illustrated with numerous photos, drawings, maps, and graphs.	2005-06-03

Atwater as one of the more formal, hard-nosed researchers in the area of near-death experiences. This book however, has a much more personal, anecdotal approach. The author goes into detail about her own three NDE's, as well as the experiences of her family and friends. In fact, it was an apparition of her mother in law that encouraged her to write this present book.<br /><br />_There is an abundance of information here suitable to both the novice and experienced reader looking for facts and validation on the subject of death and the afterlife. In addition to the numerous personal anecdotes you have some advanced theoretical models of the nature of the soul and the structure and nature of levels of existence after death. Not only that, but there is also practical information on the nature and practice of prayer, as well as, techniques for easing the passage of the dieing to the other side.<br /><br />_Underlying all is the message that sparks of the Creator exist in all of us, that we are here to co-create in unity with the Mind of God, and that we chose to come to this physical plane to grow through struggle and limitation. It all rings true to me.	2005-05-24

I am glad that I did, for it is a joy to read. My edition has an introduction by pioneering NDE researcher Dr. Raymond A. Moody, where he describes Ritchie's experience as one of the three or four most interesting and well-documented cases out of the thousands that he has studied. In fact, he reveals that it was this experience that first attracted his attention to the phenomenon as a young philosophy student.<br /><br />_This is a classic account of the near death experience. It happened, and was later published, long before such experiences were publicized in the popular media. All the key elements are here: out-of-the-body travel, the being of light, the life review, spirits of different evolutionary development finding their own \\"level\\" with like spirits, the city of light, his disappointment after returning, etc. The \\"real world\\" verifications are especially striking, such as Ritchie recognizing that he was in Vicksburg, Mississippi during his out of body experience.<br /><br />_Yes, the author has a strong Christian perspective, but it is of the best, most open-minded sort. He mentions finding the spirit of Christ in people of all races and religions. I couldn't help note that from the account it is the author that states that the being that he encountered was Jesus - not the being itself. It was obviously a manifestation of the Christ in its most pure, classical nature. However, it is clear to me that such a manifestation of living light from the Source could have also been labeled Apollo or Phanes, depending upon the experiencer's background. In any case, any cultural colorations and additions are in the latter part of the account and can be easily recognized.<br /><br />_As for credibility, the author was an Eagle Scout, college graduate, combat veteran, medical doctor, and psychiatrist. He had no overwhelmingly strong dogmatic convictions before the experience- or apparently afterwards. This is about as credible as you are ever going to find.r apparently afterwards.

You can see the film in your mind. Not only that, but you can take time to really absorb all the intricate details from panel to panel.<br /><br />_I admit that I was a little nervous about how Lucas would wrap up the prequels. I didn't need to be, for this caps them off with the mythic power of the original films. I couldn't imagine a more powerful or fitting close. I sure that Joseph Campbell would have approved, also.

She does an excellent job of examining the historical record to show both that 1) all other religions have their outer and inner teachings, and 2) it is only Christianity that seems to have had its inner teachings purposely amputated. She shows through examination of scripture and the writings of the Apostolic Fathers that such teachings undoubtedly existed. She shows Paul to have been a true Gnostic.<br /><br />_In an attempt to reconstruct the inner, esoteric, teachings she shows that all one can ever really write or reveal are the lesser of the mysteries. These are the allegorical interpretations of the deeper spiritual truths and symbolism contained in the parables told to the masses. These are the truths that would just confuse minds that are not ready for them. It is reflection upon these lesser mysteries and their meaning that may open the door to the divine revelation of the greater mysteries, where the teachers are angelic and Christ is the hierophant.<br /><br />_It is shown that even though an apparent war was waged to expunge the mysteries from Christianity by the Church bureaucracy (who apparently could not, or would not, comprehend them) the tradition never the less survived. The golden chain is shown to stretch across the ages in the teachings of the receptive whether there are attempts to suppress it or not: Pythagoras, Plato, Proclus, Iamblichus, Plotinus, Psuedo-Dionysis, Aquinas, Tauler, Eckhart, Thomas a Kempis, Giordano Bruno, Bohme, etc., etc., etc. In spite of persecution and isolation, the Divine Wisdom, the Gnosis, the Philosophia Perennis, the Theosophia breaks through again and again.<br /><br />_Why is it so important then that the mysteries be restored to the Church? Without them, it is essentially an empty shell. Any good that is done is superficial- if not accidental. Worse, it becomes a barrier to those who seek the reunion with the Divine that all men and women inherently hunger for. When the ineptitude and corruption of a supposedly spiritual institution drives good people away from God then it must be reformed or bypassed.<br /><br />How many priests have been ordained in anticipation of the revealing of the inner mysteries- only to find that no one else in the priesthood knew any more about them than they did....them, it is essentially an empty shell.

Such things are of value only if they are obtained in the pursuit of the highest Good. This highest Good is demonstrated to be God. Moreover, Boethius points out that when evil men succeed in obtaining such goals over the righteous, then they cease to truly be men- they are beasts and subhuman. This is a refreshing reminder in the modern world, a world not unlike that of late Roman times.<br /><br />_All happiness, all worth, all reason for being, lies in the One and the Good. Even when we commit immoral acts, it is a result of ignorance on our part in seeking this ultimate goal. Indeed, to turn from the quest of finding the One is to cease to exist at any meaningful level. There is no \\"fire and brimstone\\", or talk of eternal torment in hell here. There doesn't need to be. As long as you willfully or ignorantly stray from the Path then you are in hell. And to not find reconnection with the One and the Good is to cease to exist. All of our earthly existence is for the purpose of reawakening to our true nature. This truth lies within all of us and it is only reached by personal introspection (Know thyself.) Only in this way will we return to the eternal Source that lies beyond time itself.<br /><br />_The consolation of the Consolatio lies in the fact that suffering serves a purpose if it puts us back on the true Path. Moreover, earthly recognition of virtue is irrelevent. God always recognises the man of virtue if the masses do not.	2005-05-10

It was perhaps the first to bring the idea of continuing communication with a higher power to the attention of the general public. Until this book, the unquestioned assumption was that all such communication had ended in biblical times- and that anyone who claimed differently was obviously mentally unhinged. This book ,however, made a detailed, painstaking study (with personal interviews and case studies) of people in modern times who had experienced the same symptoms of revelation (the Divine Fire.) Steiger interviewed a wide variety of people from respected scholars and churchmen, to everyday housewives and business men, to \\"Jesus people\\" and New Age channellers.<br /><br />_Then he examined the different types of contact and the different contents of the information recieved. He came to the conclusion that while some of the material seemed to come from conflicting sources, the vast majority appeared to be historically consistent in tone and content down through the ages- a universal theme coming from an outside intelligence.<br /><br />_As the book points out early on, why should we think that the era of divine revelation is over? The eastern religious traditions have never made such an assumption. In the Vedic tradition the canon has never been \\"closed\\"- it is accepted that valid revelation continues to this day. Only the modern (as opposed to the gnostic) tradition has slammed the door shut in the face of God. And this seems to have been done more in the name of social control and the protection of a bureaucratic heirarchy than for any valid spiritual motivation.	2005-05-10

Part four was published in two volumes (five and six), so this book is in reality two volumes bound as one. However, Frazer considered part four to be divided into three books (Adonis and Attis in volume one, and Osiris in volume two.) In any case, they are all here in this third edition- revised, enlarged, and unabridged.<br /><br />_This addition to the his great study deals primarily with the tradition of the god-man savior (i.e. the christs that predated Christ.) Throughout the Mediterranean world mystery religions arose that centered on the combined allegorical initiation myths of a lost and resurrected goddess and a dying and resurrecting god-man.<br /><br />_While Frazer does recognize the origination of these myths in connection with vegetation and seasonal cycles, he seems to miss the later symbolism of the higher mysteries- where such god-men represented the planting of the seed of divine consciousness into the world, its trials and struggles, and its return. This was the pattern that all initiates were to follow to awaken to their own origin, true nature, and purpose in life- namely that our spirit descends into earthly existence to grow through struggle and trial, reawaken to its heavenly and immortal nature, and transcend physical death to return to the ultimate source. Still, Frazier does a magnificent job of unearthing and reassembling all the details and interrelationships of the various cults, even if the deeper meaning seems to have eluded him.<br /><br />_This University Books edition contains 15 pages of photographic plates in the front, an introduction by Sidney Waldron, and a full index.

As the author states, we are not on this earth just to have fun- we are here to refine our character, develop our talents, and contribute our unique gifts toward the greater good. Often this means that we are provided with the ideal foe- one that pushes all of our buttons. Instead of automatically striking back, we need to try to find out why this is so. That is why this book is so useful, for it not only lists every known way of trying to deal with another person that you have a problem with, but also with how to try to understand their motives.<br /><br />_Still, to his credit, the author recognizes that there are those that are so unreasonable that we will have no choice but to cut them off- and perhaps warn others. You just don't do this until you have exhausted all other options. Also, it is recognized that it is healthy and normal to have extreme emotional reactions to difficult people (how many authority figures have you encountered that considered your anger a worse sin than the offense that triggered it?)<br /><br />_I've come to the conclusion that the author is correct in his views. There are no coincidences in this life- not if we are sensitive and introspective enough to recognize and interpret them. Plus, the purpose of this life is to learn and grow- and often that means the pressure of conflict. In and of itself, conflict is not good- it is the effort to understand both your motivations and that of others that is of value.<br /><br />_This book isn't a cure-all for interpersonal conflicts by any means. However it is a good basis for a \\"reasonable man's standard\\" to use with dealing with others. Don't be too upset if you encounter people on which the approach simply will not work. Personally, over the years I've notice that there seem to be more and more people who simply cannot see that they are violating other's rights- or they simply do not care. Maybe that is why we are here- to be a thorn in their side....<br /><br />And remember- some people are merely different, not difficult.care.

I am surprised that I somehow missed reading this wonderful little book for so long. Considering the dozens of books that I've read on the topic of NDE's and of continued existence after bodily death it is remarkable that I should only encounter one of the best until last. While it is a slim volume, it covers everything of importance- and with a sincerity and enthusiasm missing in many other books.<br /><br />Specifically, this is a collection of four key lectures given by Dr. Kubler-Ross: 1) Living and Dying (1982), 2) Death Does Not Exist (1977), 3) Life, Death, and Life After Death (1980), and 4) Death of a Parent (1991).<br /><br />All of these lectures interweave and reinforce each other. The key concepts involve the body as a mere shell (or cocoon) that we outgrow to evolve into the next level of existence as a spirit (or butterfly.) The purpose of life on earth is to learn and grow through hard lessons and choices. And the most important lesson of all is that of unconditional love. If you can put this above materialism and ego, then your \\"life review\\" should go well. Oh yes, and nothing in this world occurs by \\"coincidence.\\"<br /><br />I'm inclined to prefer Dr. Kubler-Ross' words precisely because she was not an \\"objective\\", detached, observer. She studied over 20,000 accounts of NDE's, she sat at countless death beds comforting and listening to the dieing, she had an NDE herself, she was actually visited by the spirits of the dead, plus she personally experienced the state known as \\"cosmic consciousness.\\" In my opinion, this gives her words the ring of truth, and a first-hand legitimacy lacking in many other records. Plus, as I read, I quickly came to see that everything she wrote completely agreed with and confirmed my own experiences and conclusions down through the years- before I ever heard of her, or even the subject.	2005-04-27

Since they deal with eternal subject matter there is little chance of them being \\"dated.\\" The common theme running through them all is the deep power of myth on the inner, spiritual lives of human beings throughout the ages. This includes our own age, whether we personally want to admit or recognize it.<br /><br />The Lectures include:<br /><br />1)  The Impact of Science on Myth (1961),<br /><br />2)  The Emergence of Mankind (1966),<br /><br />3)  The Importance of Rites (1964),<br /><br />4)  The Separation of East and West (1961),<br /><br />5)  The Confrontation of East and West in Religion (1970)<br /><br />6)  The Inspiration of Oriental Art (1958),<br /><br />7)  Zen (1969),<br /><br />8)  The Mythology of Love (1967),<br /><br />9)  Mythologies of War and Peace (1967),<br /><br />10) Schizophrenia- the Inward Journey (1970),<br /><br />11) The Moon Walk- The Outer Journey (1970),<br /><br />12) Envoy: No More Horizons (1971),<br /><br />  The reader will recognize much of the subject matter from the later talks with Bill Moyers in the \\"Power of Myth\\" series. All in all there is enough material covered to make this an excellent introduction to myth, true spirituality, and depth psychology.<br /><br />  One of the topics that stuck with me was the fundamental difference in the nature of religion in the East, the Near East, and the West. Traditional Eastern societies were seen as governed by one great cosmic law through which all members were seen to draw their purpose, their worth, their meaning. God was in all things and the divine spark was in all individuals. Union with the divine was possible to those that transcended their ego. In the Near-East human beings (including the King) were seen as the groveling \\"tenant-farmers\\" of God. Men were the slaves of the Gods and could only beg and sacrifice to obtain boons. Man was in no way a part of God- matter and spirit were artificially split (mythic dissociation.) Finally, there was the Greek model- mankind as the rivals and competitors of the Gods. The Greek had turned ego into God, laying the foundation for the total denial of the very existence of spirit. That is, except for the initiates of the Mysteries....<br /><br /> There is a section of reference notes citing sources in the back of the book, as well as, a full index for quick reference.ic dissociation.)

It deals with the temple and the mysteries of the Great Mother- both in history and its rebirth in modern times. The Great Mother (Magna Mater) was also known as Cybele. She was, in addition, termed Ma Rhea (mother of god.)<br /><br /> Her son/consort was Attis- also known as the gentle shepherd and redeamer. Attis died by his own hand beneath the sacred pine, only to be reborn as the daughter of the Goddess. In this way, he/she transcended both death and gender. Following this example, the priestesses of the Goddess (the Gallae) have traditionally been transgendered. This, as well as the simularity between the myth of Attis and their own Christ, earned the followers of the Goddess special emnity from early Christians. However, it should be noted that the worship of Cybele and Attis stretches far back into the neolithic, and is one of the oldest of myths- long,long predating Christianity.<br /><br /> The author is to be credited with resurrecting the temple and the mysteries and magic of the Great Mother. May the Great Goddess protect and guide them on their spiritual path.	2005-04-12

Coomaraswamy and ReneÌ GueÌnon	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Introduction to the Eternal	I am truly glad that I was introduced this marvelous book. This is because my soul has long resonated to its subject- the Philosophia Perennis, or the Perennial Philosophy. Some would say the primary subject of the book is really the lives of the two great metaphysicians and promulgators of the Tradition in the first half of the twentieth century, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy and Rene Guenon. While it does deal with the lives and work of these giants, really, they were \\"merely\\" two of the modern vessels for this eternal Tradition. They themselves assigned the real importance of their work to the Tradition and downplayed any original contributions on their own part. Like all of us whose souls resonate to the vertical path of the Cross, of the World Tree or Axis Mundi, they primarily \\"recollected\\" these teachings in the Platonic or Gnostic sense. Coomaraswamy and Guenon were supremely aware of the true source of their inspiration.<br /><br /> I'm sure there are many modern scholars and materialists that will try to read to this book only to come away with absolutely no understanding of it. That is because all such teachings are presented for those with the \\"ears to hear.\\" If you are ready, then you will intuitively understand what is meant by such terms as quantity and quality, indeed, you've probably known it for many years. Indeed, if you understand what is being discussed here you will no doubt understand the source works with minimal interpretation (the Gitas, Upanishads, the Tao te Ching, the Hermetica, the Gnostic Scriptures, etc.) You will also recognize false and dead academic interpretations of no real understanding.... To the quantitative, empirical, analytical, statistical-minded academics out there this will all be dismissed as self-referencing, hermeneutical, irrationality. However, you will know better in your heart of hearts, for you understand mystical insight and direct intuitive recognition of the underlying values, meanings, and perceptions of things. You know the difference between rational and suprarational understanding. You are steadily ascending the vertical axis of the Cross. You are becoming, through \\"recollection\\", the sage and teacher that you could never find among the sterile, dead ashes of the modern world of scientism.<br /><br /> I personally found it enlightening that both Coomaraswamy and Guenon were initially highly accomplished in the sciences and mathematics.

That is, it reminded me of the sense of excitement that I once felt for the wonders of the earth.<br /><br /> This is not some dry-as-dust history, for you actually feel like you are accompanying Smith on his travels through England as he laid the foundations for the modern science of geology. For that is what William \\"Strata\\" Smith was- the founder of modern Geology, and the first working field geologist. Sure, there had been academic and aristocratic dilettantes working in the field before Smith, but it was he who actually got his hands dirty and climbed down into the mines and canal excavations. It was he who formulated the Law of Superposition, and if I am not mistaken, the Law of Faunal Succession. It was Smith who was the first to actually go out (with a pack horse) and first correlate sections, measure strike and dip, and use index fossils to differentiate strata. And, of course, he was the first to visualise how to depict the three-dimensional structure of the earth on a geologic map.<br /><br /> Anyone who has tried to work steadily in the field will recognize and sympathize with Smith's ups and downs. He rose from very humble rural beginnings to essentially educate himself and then secure a successful and well-respected career, only to end up essentially homeless for a decade and then in a debtor's prison. He saw his work stolen by others. It was only in his later years that his reputation and fortunes were reestablished. Anyone familiar with the oil patch will recognize this pattern.... Oh yes, and the snobbery and elitism of academic geologists for those who actually work for a living will also strike a familiar note.<br /><br /> I have one small complaint with this otherwise excellently written book. The author mentions the Enclosure Acts while trying to explain Smith's village background in the 18th century. He makes it sound like the Acts were instituted by Parliament purely to provide for the more efficient farming, if not beautification, of the English countryside. Anyone who is familiar with Enclosure (and not trying to rewrite history) knows that this was a colossal land-grab by landed gentry to throw the poor off of commonly held village lands. It also served to make the rural poor desperate enough to work in the hellish mines and mills of the early industrial revolution....fficient farming, if not beautification, of the English countryside.

He spent the rest of his life, he was in his mid-thirties at the time, trying to figure out what had happened to him, and if there were any others.<br /><br /> What he found was that such sudden occurances of enlightenment, these epiphanies, had been occuring to mystics, philosophers, writers, and artists all through recorded history. Not only that, but they were occuring with increased frequency as time went on. Bucke concluded that this marked an evolutionary trend. Carried out to its logical conclusion, he postulated that one day \\"cosmic consciousness\\" as he termed it, would be as common in the human race as self consciousness currently is. He based this on the manner in which the ancestors of man slowly climbed from the simple consciousness of animals to an almost universal state of self consciousness.<br /><br /> Having experienced a simular event in my mid-thirties (remember, it happens to varying degrees), I found this book to be immensely personally relevant- as it has proven to be to many of us for over one hundred years now.	2005-03-28

Many people just don't \\"get\\" the constant stream of depression, misery, and atrocity. From the start I saw the underlying truth of the situations, which is the basis of any good creation- comic strip or otherwise. This is an examination of the existential absurdity of modern urban life. This is an ode to the constant stream of irritation and suffering in a totally alienated and alienating blighted urban landscape.<br /><br />  Yet, the completely self absorbed characters of Amy and Jordan aren't all that sympathetic. They are as self-absorbed as all the monsters and sociopaths around them. You get the idea that the only reason that terrible things are happening to them are that they haven't had the chance to do it to others first. The constant theme is that life is an ordeal without meaning or purpose. Even children are sadistic monsters that will torture you if they can. It is repeatedly stated that you can trust no one. When supernatural elements such as the angel of death, demons, or ghosts pop up they are also shown to be just extensions of this same theme.<br /><br />  And yet, it seems to me that there is a lesson here. The universe is largely what you make it- or at least limit your perceptions to see it as. If you choose to see suffering as meaningless then it is meaningless. If your concerns are exclusively materialistic and meaningless then that is how the world will in turn react to you. If you are totally wrapped up in your own self-absorbed little ego then the universe will inflict a synchronistic string of disasters on you, both great and small, until that ego is beaten down- and you see behind it all.<br /><br />  I find it significant that the artist states, as himself, in the last strip of the collection that creative ideas are not invented but exist on other planes of existence and that artists merely connect with them and reinterpret them for a new generation. In that case, what is being connected with here is the upper rings of Hell- and Beyer and Dante are showing us the same thing in their own unique way.<br /><br />  As for the critics of the artist's unique drawing style- it is no more highly stylized and consistent than, say, Schulz work on \\"Peanuts.\\" This book itself has a truly unique design different from any other collection of strips that I am familiar with.

It was perhaps the first to bring the idea of continuing communication with a higher power to the attention of the general public. Until this book, the unquestioned assumption was that all such communication had ended in biblical times- and that anyone who claimed differently was obviously mentally unhinged. This book ,however, made a detailed, painstaking study (with personal interviews and case studies) of people in modern times who had experienced the same symptoms of revelation (the Divine Fire.) Steiger interviewed a wide variety of people from respected scholars and churchmen, to everyday housewives and business men, to \\"Jesus people\\" and New Age channellers.<br /><br />Then he examined the different types of contact and the different contents of the information recieved. He came to the conclusion that while some of the material seemed to come from conflicting sources, the vast majority appeared to be historically consistent in tone and content down through the ages- a universal theme coming from an outside intelligence.<br /><br />As the book points out early on, why should we think that the era of divine revelation is over? The eastern religious traditions have never made such an assumption. In the Vedic tradition the canon has never been \\"closed\\"- it is accepted that valid revelation continues to this day. Only the modern (as opposed to the gnostic) tradition has slammed the door shut in the face of God. And this seems to have been done more in the name of social control and the protection of a bureaucratic heirarchy than for any valid spiritual motivation.	2005-03-24

I find it remarkable that Simak was writing about genetic engineering in 1967. He even nailed the fact that religious and social conservatives would be up in arms over the issue.<br /><br /> Set some five hundred years into the future, mankind has been exploring space for centuries. Yet, remarkably few of the new worlds that have been discovered are suitable for human life. In fact, only the terrible expensive and time-consuming process of terra forming can make more worlds livable for man.<br /><br /> However, genetic engineers have come up with a program to adapt man to fit an alien environment and not vice versa. Humans could be genetically altered to exist under hostile conditions of intolerable gravity, heat, cold, or toxic atmospheres. While they might not look strictly human in the traditional sense, inside they would still think and feel as any other human being might.<br /><br /> Reactionary elements, however, held that this would be unnatural and the results would not be human as much they would be abominations and monsters.<br /><br /> What neither side initially knew was that this experiment had been tried two centuries before- and abandoned. At that time an even more radical experiment had been attempted. Instead of adapting one strain of man to a single hostile environment, a synthetic man (an android) would be developed with an open-ended genetic structure that would be able to mimic the form, and the mind, of any alien life form. It was thought that this would be the perfect tool to infiltrate and study any alien culture. It was also thought that such an open-ended synthetic man could be reused on many different planets. What the bio-engineers didn't realize was that every time such a being took on the form of an alien he would also take on its mind- permanently. This meant that over time many different, individual, alien personalities would share the same brain- a sort of ultimate schizophrenic. Not only that, but these different alien personalities would be able to intercommunicate and cooperate. Plus, at any moment, they could take on their original form once again. That was why the original breakthrough had been termed the \\"Werewolf Principle.\\"<br /><br /> Now, after 200 years of being frozen in deep space, the last surviving experimental \\"werewolf\\" has been found and returned to earth. Yet neither he, nor his rescuers know who or what he truly is. Not only that, but the two alien personalities melded with the original synthetic are a psychic wolf-thing that can even talk to the stars, and a chameleon-like biological computer of near infinite intellect.<br /><br /> The debate over genetic engineering is about to get very interesting....onalities would be able to intercommunicate and cooperate.

While this book is really a companion volume to the author's _Shadow World_ it can easily stand alone on its own merits. One day it would be nice to see both volumes offered in a hard cover gift set, if not a single volume. Taken together, they do seem to form a fitting master capstone for over 50 years of profoundly significant work. Perhaps a three-volume set could also include the author's seminal _Revelation: the Divine Fire_.<br /><br /> Primarily, this book expands the roster of extra-dimensional beings that we share our universe with. In addition to the spirits of the dead, nature spirits, deiform spirits, spirit parasites, and spirit mimics of the previous volume, the nature of the Light Beings are explored. This includes the benevolent entities termed angels, spirit guides, spirit teachers, and celestial visitors or \\"space brothers.\\" Techniques for contact and behavior are included. It is pointed out that such entities should never be either worshipped or summoned- if they respond to this then they are not what they claim to be. Once again, the many case studies that illustrate the bulk of the book are well written and well researched.<br /><br /> There is much more to this book, however: Near-Death experiences, Out of Body Experiences, dream teachings, calling for divine aid, and S-Force energy. The latter (S-Force or supernatural energy) is shown to be related to the Algonquins' Manitou, the Sufis' Baraka, and Plato's Nous. It has been called prana, mana, ki, chi, wodan, ruach, and the Holy Spirit. Only one who truly Knows Himself thoroughly should ever attempt channeling it with their own will. Only if you are so absolutely sure of your deepest motives and motivations that you can whole-heartedly ask to be struck down rather than help to work evil or do harm should you attempt to mold and direct such power.<br /><br /> One of the human light workers in one an included case study points out that we are all spiritual beings and can experience many dimensions- we have a responsibility to get that message out. What we do on earth, it is also pointed out, is our choice, but to deny, ridicule, deter, or prevent that message from reaching others will harm our own spiritual growth. And to advance such false goals as wealth and materialism will make this world an even more evil and difficult place to live. She goes on to say that being indifferent to the needs of others makes us responsible for poverty, greed, and suffering. You seldom find the Truth spelled out so clearly in these modern times....<br /><br /> The concluding chapter deals with maintaining a mystical state of consciousness. It includes William James's four criteria for defining a mystical consciousness: Ineffability, Noetic quality, Transiency, and Passivity. This is important since only one gifted with mystic Union should attempt the channeling of S-force. It can be done.dimensions- we have a responsibility to get that message out.

I was curious as to how close the novelization was to the original- and if it would include any additional information not included in the film as shot. I found it to be extremely close to the film with a few minor exceptions. By reading the story you pick up plot and set details that you might otherwise miss. I have heard people call this film \\"flawed\\"- honestly I do not see where either it, or this book, has any obvious major flaws. They are true classics.<br /><br />One other thing, coming back to this film after many years can change your perspective. When I first saw it in my younger days, the character of Theodore Roosevelt was my clear favorite. In fact, I resented what I saw as the parodying of him in a few scenes. My favorite details were the accurate depictions of historical ships, weapons, and uniforms. I found the unabashed imperialist theme to be thrilling and inspiring.<br /><br />Now, watching the same film three decades later, it is the Raisuli and his people that I find to be the more interesting. The American and European characters seem somehow trivial and shallow in comparison. The Imperial \\"game\\" seems wasteful and pointless. On the other hand, the Raisuli is a man of depth. When he was young and foolish he thought that he could ignore or oppose the will of God. Then, in the living death of the dungeons of Mogador, he was reborn. Even the guards recognized that the Baraka was with him. He wandered alone into the mountains and became Lord of the Riff, true defender of the faith, by divine providence. This is a king in the truest, traditional sense- a man who is one with his people, his land, his God. He fights to free his land of the corruption of the profane outsiders, and those who would betray all in the name of mere money. He is the Lion that represents the heart of the land, fighting against the tide of the meaningless, relentless western wind. In comparison to this, all other characters are as childish, cardboard cutouts of true men.<br /><br />This particular edition contains a large section on the making of the film in the back. Milius talks of his vision for it, and the difficulties in getting it made. There are some interesting anecdotes (like the problem in getting the actual U.S. Marine extras and the Spanish army extras to start off in the marching scenes on the same foot.) There are also individual biographies of the actors playing all the major characters, as well as that of the writer-director and producer. The cover art is based on the original poster art for the movie.to this, all other characters are as childish, cardboard cutouts of true men. <br /> <br />This particular edition contains a large section on the making of the film in the back.

I've lost track of the number of times that I've reread this little book over the years- I know that I've taken it on camping and field trips several times. Simak weaves a feeling, an atmosphere, that is not only believable, but one that you want to recapture again and again. You buy the characters, you buy the ideas, you buy the reality of the surroundings. And that is all the more remarkable in a time-travel story.<br /><br /> Asa Steele was a paleontogy instructor from a small western college- and just about fed-up with it. He returned home to rural Wisconsin on sabatical to think things over- and to investigate what he thought might be the site of a crashed UFO that he remembered as a boy. Like so much else, it was still there unchanged. The fragments that he escavated came back from the university lab as belonging to an unknown alloy with extraordinary properties. Yet there was nothing else that really proved an extraterrestrial origin. That is, until his dog started to bring back dinosaur bones and other artifacts from the gateway that the ship had punched through the space-time fabric....<br /><br />While kids will love this story, it isn't really a child's book. The adult character development is quite good. So are the plot complications (of course the government would try to seize a gateway into the past- to hand over to its corporate masters.) But the theme of unlimited, pristine, uninhabited worlds ready for the taking are what really sets this particular book apart. I know that I would pack up and take off to them in a heartbeat.	2005-03-11

I chose it because it comes from a period before university curriculums were \\"dumbed down.\\" Back when this was written the B.S. was still the terminal degree for most working geologists- you only needed an advanced degree if you were going to teach or do cutting edge research. In any case, this is a very comprehensive study of a type that is superior to most newer books. Of course, as Dr. Pearl points out, you don't just learn geology from a book- it also takes lab and field work.<br /><br />The book itself is organized into the two traditional sections of Physical and Historical Geology. There is also an introductory first chapter on the history, method, tools, and professional path of the geologist.  After that Part One (Physical) is divided into the following chapters: 2) Our Planet Earth, 3) Interior of the Earth, 4) Vulcanism, 5) Geologic Structures Produced by Diastrophism, 6) Earthquakes, 7) Minerals, 8) Rocks, 9) Weathering and Soils, 10) Gravity Movements, 11) Streams, 12) Ground Water, 13) Glaciation, 14) Swamps and Lakes, 15) Oceans, 16) Wind, and 17) Maps. Part Two (Historical) covers: 18) Origin of the Earth, 19) Evolution of Life, 20) Interpretation of Geologic History, 21) Pre-Cambrian Eras, 22) Paleozoic Era, 23) Mesozoic Era, and 24) Cenozoic Era.<br /><br />There are study questions at the end of each chapter, as well a tough final exam at the end of the book. If you wish to use it for reference the detailed table of contents and full index make it fast and easy to look up any topic.<br /><br />Don't worry about the information being dated- Pearl completely reworked this edition to be in-line with continental drift, magnetic reversal, and plate tectonics.<br /><br />Geology is the most comprehensive, practical and useful of the traditional fields of physical science. It is practical because it gives you an intricate knowledge of the composition, structure, and activity of the planet, which is useful in everything from prospecting for mineral resources to siting construction projects. It is comprehensive since it draws heavily from all the other branches of science- chemistry, physics, zoology, paleontology, astronomy, engineering mechanics, surveying- you have to have a familiarity with them all.

In fact, this is the third time that I've found myself rereading it. You could do far worse than to make this your primary reference work on the subject.<br /><br /> The author divides spirit manifestations into the following categories: 1) Spirits of the dead (traditional visitations and hauntings- often involving family members), 2) Poltergeists (violent hauntings that are energized by the psyche of a living human), 3) Phantoms (long term apparitions that become psychic marionettes), 4) Animal spirits, 5) Nature spirits (never human entities- devas, fairies, elves), 6) Deiform spirits (archetypical, god-like beings), 7) Spirit residue (psychic energy or impressions impressed into the natural environment, 8) Spirit parasites (hostile entities, capable of possession, traditional demons, and 9) Spirit mimics (in-between beings of the spiritual no-man's land, tricksters and liars.) Most of these categories are addressed in their own descriptive chapter. Multiple case studies (personally verified by the author) illustrate each phenomenon.<br /><br /> The last chapter is especially useful since it deals with how to personally interact with spirits. The principles are useful and practical: 1) don't ignore your psychic encounters (pay attention- there is usually a reason for such contact), 2) don't take all spirit or psychic messages literally (there are levels of symbolism involved), 3) combine psychic impressions with common sense (some spirits are simply inept, and some are active liars, frauds, and tricksters), 4) and learn to develop your paranormal abilities (the more you practice the better it works.) There are also warnings, tips, and techniques on how to recognize and resist negative entities.<br /><br /> It once depressed me that so many people seemed to regard the existence of the \\"shadow world\\" next to our own as fantasy, superstition, or mental instability. Mr. Steiger's research over the past half century has been instrumental in changing that. In fact, this book cites polls that show that a majority of people accept the survival of the spirit after death- and existence of spirit contact across the veil. The author's daughter is quoted as saying that this is the real importance of such phenomena- they provide personal and reassuring proof of survival after physical death. Some would call that wishful thinking, but I think that it is more in-line with rediscovering eternal Truth.ition, or mental instability.

This strip ran exclusively in the old New York Sunday News from 1952 to 1955. It was far ahead of its time- and one of the best hard science fiction strips ever published. The writer was science fiction pioneer Jack Williamson, and the artist, Lee Elias. Elias had also worked on Terry and the Pirates and he carried over the same highly detailed style into this strip. Volume one has a nice introduction written by Williamson on the history of project.<br /><br /> The strip itself centered around the main character of Mike Flint, licensed spatial engineer and free-lance pilot. Flint is headquartered on Brooklyn Rock, in the new frontier of the asteroid belt- in the year 2191. In fact, the entire strip has the feeling of the excitement of a new, booming frontier- full of post-war optimism for a bright scientific future. Indeed, the freshness of the strip really holds up- it is hard to believe that it ran half a century ago.<br /><br /> An interesting feature is the \\"Space Guard\\" introduced in this series. You can see where it originated from Williamson's \\"Space Legion\\" (a boyhood favorite of Asimov's.) It is also obviously the inspiration for Elias' excellent later work on \\"Tommy Tomorrow and the Planeteers\\" for D.C. comics.<br /><br /> Both volumes are printed in black and white except for the excellent cover art. Only volume one has Williamson's introduction. These two books contain every strip of the entire run.	2005-03-02

I'd have to say that this novelization of the movie is close to the original. In fact, I now know things about the character that never came out before- things that make sense.<br /><br />John Constantine is a free-lance occultist and paranormal detective in the series. Here is more of a supernatural enforcer- he enforces the Balance between heaven and hell. It is pointed out that angelic and demonic forces are only permitted to influence mankind through hints and suggestions, for man has free will and must be allowed to stand or fall according to his own decisions. Whenever a spirit crosses the boundary to directly control, or harm, then Constantine sends them back- with extreme prejudice. His tool of preference is a \\"Holy Shotgun\\"....<br /><br />The thing that keeps this from being just another supernatural slasher story is the metaphysical detail. There are some authentic sources and ideals woven into the story. The ideas actually make you think. For instance, it is stated that God had nothing to do with the making of Hell- it was a co-creation of those spirits and human souls that separated themselves from the presence of God by their own actions. Then there is the concept that the Cosmos runs according to \\"spiritual physics\\" incorporated into its very fabric, and not arbitrary religious laws or whim. Or the idea that lost spirits seem so stupid because they cannot think once they have lost the physical body and its physical brain (they never learned to act from the heart and not the head.) Oh yeah, and finally it is pointed out that the only suicides that end up in hell are those who died in despair (not those with a good or noble reason for their actions.)<br /><br />I know that movie novelizations have a reputation for not being that good, but the author of this one has both a Bram Stoker Award and he was coscreenwriter for \\"The Crow.\\"	2005-02-23

After a 14 year hiatus, Grimjack is back- and he has lost none of his edge.<br /><br />The character of John Gaunt (a.k.a. Grimjack) is a complex one. He is one part film noir detective, one part Venetian bravo, one part western gunfighter- and all with an otherworldly edge. Yet I think the entire character can be summed up by the fact that he voluntarily walked out of the afterlife (or \\"heaven\\") to return to earth to stand by his friends. He did this even though he was warned that he could never return and that he would be doomed to wander the earth in reincarnation after reincarnation until the end of time....<br /><br />Honestly, reading the new introduction and epilog is like a reunion with an old friend. In fact it is told in a manner that seems like Gaunt is talking to you- as well as Roscoe, Jericho Noleski, Blacjacmac, Goddess, Gordon- and Bob the watch-lizard. It was especially good that they decided to bring back the Gaunt incarnation and all the associated characters- I had thought that they were gone forever.<br /><br />As for the reprinted stories that make up the core of the book you get: \\"Zago\\"- the very first Grimjack story (and still one of the best), \\"Buried Past\\" (that introduces Cadre and Pdwyr), \\"Night of the Killer Bunnies\\" (which developed both the humor and humanity of the character), and \\"Blood and Thunder\\" (which ties Grimjack and the Starslayer universes together.)<br /><br />The story both starts and ends in Munden's Bar, where we are told that we are welcome anytime- and to put the drinks on Gaunt's tab.	2005-02-21

Vishnu, the Preserver- he who descends to earth whenever evil is ascendant to uphold righteousness and punish the wicked.<br /><br />Sometimes a visual medium is the best way to get spiritual teaching stories across. In this way the images remain in the mind of the student until he, or she, is ready to connect them to their own life and thereby realize the deeper meaning at a later time. These well-told, well-drawn, full color stories do this with four of the traditional tales of Vishnu from the Vaishnava Puranas: Gajendra, Ambarisha, Vrikasura, and Rantideva. All four stories teach clear, positive, non-ambiguous lessons of what it means to be pleasing, or displeasing, to the greatest of the aspects of God in the Hindu pantheon. Along the way one is also introduced to Brahma, Shiva, Indra, Yama, and other of the devas.<br /><br />These \\"comics\\" are a high quality production and remind me of the old Classics Illustrated series.	2005-02-18

I still get choked up when I think of generation after generation of highly evolved dogs sitting around  camp fires and debating over whether or not the mythical race of gods known as \\"man\\" ever really existed. Of course the same goes for the idea of robots carrying out man's dream of exploring the universe, as a sacred trust, long after men have ceased to be. And of course there is also the matter of the supreme sacrifice of man to ensure that his old companions will develop to their full potential- without human interference.<br /><br />As much as I love Simak's _Waystation_ and _The Goblin Reservation_, this book is probably his masterpiece. It is certainly his most epic, covering so many millenia. I am so glad that Old Earth Books has put it back into print. Here are themes that he would expand in such works as _Ring Around the Sun_, _A Choice of Gods_, and _Special Deliverence_. This is good, because when you finish you definately are left wanting more.<br /><br />I think that it was Heinlein that once said, \\"If you don't like Simak, then you don't like science fiction.\\" I couldn't agree more.	2005-02-17

Coomaraswamy would have known.<br /><br />Guenon points out that the Vedanta is neither religion, nor is it a philosophy, in the Western sense. What is it then? It is a complete way of life. More than this, it is in and of itself, the totality of existence. It is the true Metaphysic. You see, Western thinking always categorizes and systematizes. It views what it studies from outside- and manages to sterilize and kill it. This is why the western man finds it so easy to put aside his \\"religion\\" and \\"philosophy\\" when comes the opportunity for exploitation and war. You cannot put aside the Vedanta, for it is the totality of existence- including you. It is Reality. And the farther you separate yourself from it, the less \\"real\\" you become. The end result of a profane society is a world of shadow with no real substance at all.<br /><br />The goal of the Vedanta is unity with the Universal. You seek alignment with that which was before all else. More specifically you seek to realize this union consciously, for you, and everything and every being, emanated from this Source. You still contain a Divine spark or seed at the core of your being. You realize this with your heart through Intuition and not through your brain and its lesser form of knowing. The more you rely on the brain and its elaborate ego constructs the farther you stray from the Ultimate Source and Goal.<br /><br />There are many subtle variations on finding the path back- many schools of Yoga. Just remember, in all of them Yoga still means \\"Union\\"- the goal is the same. To reach it is to rise above caste through transcendence.<br /><br />If you are already familiar with the teachings of Taoism, Neo-Platonism, or Hermetism then you will digest this study more readily. This is because these other branches of tradition drew from the original Tradition expressed first by the Vedanta.<br /><br />Anyone that attempts to use the Tradition for profane and veiled ends that ignore the inherent divinity within all beings will no doubt deserve what they will inevitably get.s to use the Tradition for profane and veiled ends that ignore the inherent divinity within all beings will no doubt deserve what they will inevitably get.	2005-02-17

What if they were organized? What if they had unbelievable powers, such as the ability to cross between alternate worlds or dimensions at will, or to intuitively reach the absolutely correct answer by intuition or \\"hunch\\", or to telepathically reach out to the stars? Such supermen would automatically try to conquer lesser men, would they not? Or would they do everything in their power to free the rest of humanity from slavery and suffering? Just what would the political and corporate powers- that- be do to keep their power and their slaves? How would mutants undermine the power of these bosses to set mankind free?<br /><br />This is a story of unlimited freedom, of worlds without end, ready for the taking. It is also the story of powerful, benevolent beings that exist only to help those who need that help. Simak sets this optimism off against the far-flung future- of 1987. This is a future of a lop-sided mechanical culture of technology that could provide creature comfort for a few, but not human justice or security for the many. It is a future of hate, and war, and worry. Nothing like the way the world really turned out....<br /><br />Years ago when I first read this novel the uncanny \\"coincidences\\" with my own life gave me chills.<br /><br />But then, there couldn't really be an underground of mutants working to free humanity... could there?	2005-02-17

Indeed, if we were to totally eliminate this censor our brains might very well be overwhelmed by an all-seeing, all-knowing God-like state that we just are not ready to handle either mentally or spiritually. However, it may be that our higher Self (as opposed to our physical brain) is naturally a fourth dimensional entity.<br /><br /> This is the best book on this subject that I have found, it is a step beyond even Rucker's work.	2005-02-16

It is amazing that a simple selection sequence of eight colored cards could reveal so much about internal anxieties, compensations, and conflicts. Yet, there definately is a correlation with these inner states and color preference.<br /><br /> This is probably the easiest of the deep psychological tests to administer and interpret. It is not a game and is not to be used carelessly or improperly. In fact, I first heard about it in graduate school when I overheard one of the psychology professors go ballistic when he found that the undergraduates were administering the test to each other. He wasn't upset because he thought it was nonsense, on the contrary, he was upset because he knew it to be a deep and powerful tool with the potential to do great damage if misused.<br /><br /> One further warning, if you buy an older edition of this book make sure that: #1 the eight cards are included, and #2 that they are not too badly faded.<br /><br /> Oh yes, the text states that this test is still accurate even if you are color blind!	2005-02-16

If one has the left brain traits necessary to grasp the transfinite logic and mathematics, then the mystical implications are ungraspable. And if you have the right brain intuition to understand the mystical implications, then you often struggle with the logic and mathematics. This book requires a reader with not only a first rate mind, but also a balanced one.<br /><br /> To briefly abstract the primary thesis: time is really motion in extra dimensional space. This is profound, for Ouspensky was the first to actually point towards where an actual, physical fourth dimension can be found. Our brains confuse this dimension with time. It can be split off from time with an adjustment, or evolution, of consciousness. You see, this represents the next huge leap in understanding the nature of the universe and reality. Just as Newton's undefined quantity of \\"gravity\\" was shown to actually be curved space, so does Ouspensky show Einstein's undefined quantity of \\"time\\" to be motion through higher physical dimensions.<br /><br /> If you want a book that will challenge you, this is it. One day these ideas are going to shake the very foundations of mainstream science, of mankind's collective view of \\"reality\\"....	2005-02-16

Such things are of value only if they are obtained in the pursuit of the highest Good. This highest Good is demonstrated to be God. Moreover, Boethius points out that when evil men succeed in obtaining such goals over the righteous, then they cease to truly be men- they are beasts and subhuman. This is a refreshing reminder in the modern world, a world not unlike that of late Roman times.<br /><br /> All happiness, all worth, all reason for being, lies in the One and the Good. Even when we commit immoral acts, it is a result of ignorance on our part in seeking this ultimate goal. Indeed, to turn from the quest of finding the One is to cease to exist at any meaningful level. There is no \\"fire and brimstone\\", or talk of eternal torment in hell here. There doesn't need to be. As long as you willfully or ignorantly stray from the Path then you are in hell. And to not find reconnection with the One and the Good is to cease to exist. All of our earthly existence is for the purpose of reawakening to our true nature. This truth lies within all of us and it is only reached by personal introspection (Know thyself.) Only in this way will we return to the eternal Source that lies beyond time itself.<br /><br /> The consolation of the Consolatio lies in the fact that suffering serves a purpose if it puts us back on the true Path. Moreover, earthly recognition of virtue is irrelevent. God always recognises the man of virtue if the masses do not.	2005-02-16

Besides the psychological terror that builds, you have cosmically mind boggling themes of infinate time and space- and the world beyond this world, of which ours is but a pale inferior shadow.<br /><br /> I often wonder just who William Hope Hodgeson was.

It does this by first examining the anthropomorphic manifestation of this center or axis- the World King. This is the True King of the primordial spiritual tradition- the human center through which the highest spiritual Source manifests. In the Vedic tradition this is Manu, the principle of the primordial and universal legislator. This is the being, the cosmic intelligence, that reflects pure spiritual light and formulates the Law (the Dharma) that is appropriate to the current conditions of our world and cycle of existence. Earthly kings have traditionally aspired (more or less) to embody this ideal. It is pointed out that such a \\"Sovereign Pontiff\\" is intended to be a living bridge between man and God (pontifex meaning \\"builder of bridges.)<br /><br /> Unfortunately, it is pointed out that in this Kali Yuga, this Age of Iron, these principles have become diluted and corrupted. Indeed, they are all but forgotten in an age that only worships power, wealth, and pleasure. And as time passes this estrangement from primordial unity grows greater. That is why in this dark time the King (or City, Mountain, or Tree) that represents this Center is said to be hidden (underground or behind a veil.) It is hidden in the sense that most modern men lack the training (and motivation) to find their way back to the ideal of perfect union with the Higher Realm. Yet, a few individuals always arise, by Divine Grace, to pass on this tradition in the form of the Sophia Perennis.<br /><br /> The initial inspiration for this book was the controversy surrounding the accounts of Ossendowski's travels in central Asia. It isn't strictly a defense of this traveler's claims, as it is an interpretation. Guenon points out how the Russian adventurer and soldier, Ossendowski, has apparently misinterpreted metaphorical tales for literal ones. A prime example of this is when he reports that one must reach the subterranean kingdom of Agartha by way of the \\"magic\\" of the OM. The \\"magic\\" that he refers to is the use of meditation as a path to know God. Indeed it is somewhat ironic that he went out of his way to give the Russian's veracity the benefit of the doubt, when he repeatedly refused to do the same for Madame Blavatsky.rtha by way of the \\"magic\\" of the OM.

It is, in my humble opinion, the best single volume on the subject of symbols and symbolism written in modern times.<br /><br />Symbolism is a sacred way of looking at the outer world. It is a way of connecting the outer and inner worlds. A materialist sees, let's say an eagle, and simply sees a bird, while a symbolist sees an eagle and sees a message, a lesson, or a sermon. To the symbolist, the eagle also represents height, spirit, the sun, nobility, power, the lion of the air, etc. The symbolist doesn't totally ignore the materialist and mundane aspect of the eagle, he just realises that there is immeasurably MORE behind it.<br /><br />The introduction of this book is an excellent essay of the symbolist mind-set. It covers symbolism in platonic thought, hermetism, renaissance thought, alchemy, heraldry, dream symbolism, as well as, the views of Goethe, Saunier, Bele, Guenon, Eliade, Scheider, and, of course, Jung.<br /><br />The body of the book is in dictionary form with concise but comprehensive descriptions of topics from a historic and multi-cultural viewpoint. This is assisted by the many excellent line drawings, as well as, two sections of carefully chosen black and white photographs.<br /><br />This is a book of correspondenses, of resonance, of the common rythym that connects things with a higher, sacred place. You learn that there are immeasurable depths to creation- and that you have merely been skipping across the surface of that creation like a stone across deep waters....	2005-02-05

Primarily, this is the story of the education of a Taoist adept and renunciate from willful child to a master who is fully in harmony with heaven and earth. Secondarily, it is a glimpse into the intact monastic community of the Haushan mountains- before its dissolution in the post-Imperial chaos of the 20th century.<br /><br />There is more than a little Taoist wisdom interwoven into the story. Indeed, it is a fine teaching aid. You get a sense of the careful guiding and molding of young Kwan Saihung by the Grand Master. Basic Taoist ethics, meditation, internal alchemy, healing, martial arts, divination, astral travel- are all touched upon. You get a sense of both the mundane and tedious groundwork of monastic life, as well as, the ego-shattering elements of crisis and initiation.<br /><br />The advice concerning the purging of one's ming huan (karma) is especially refreshing in today's world. You came into this world with problems and dilemmas to be met and mastered. You are to burn away all your attachments and worldly goals, purge desire, and satisfy the thirst for knowledge (the exact opposite of the teachings of modern materialism.) You never refuse experience, and you overcome all obstacles that such experience presents. In this way you can leave this word fulfilled and pass to a higher plane.<br /><br />Saihung's anger at the Japanese invasion of the 30's- and his decision to leave the order and fight as a \\"wandering Taoist\\"- is more than a little appropriate in today's world. After years of soul-numbing combat he returned to the monastery. He had come to realize the ultimate corruption of the outer world and the meaninglessness of war. He came to realize that humanity had to work out their own destiny- including war- and that no Taoist (or even the Jade Emperor) could do it for them.<br /><br />2) _Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel_<br /><br />  While reading this second book in the author's _Chronicles of the Tao Trilogy_ it repeatedly occurred to me that it lacked the depth and meaning of the first volume. It seemed to have degenerated to a martial arts morality play. However, having finished reading the last section, I now see that I was wrong. This is even more powerful than the first book, for it is a tale of slipping from the Path of the Tao having once touched upon it. It is a story of striving, falling, and re-ascending.<br /><br />The book starts with some excellent discussions on the nature of Taoism and the Tao. But after that it quickly switches to a description of martial arts training and how it intersects with the spiritual lives of the monks of Huanchan. Indeed, the pride of some of the monks, even the Grand Master, at meeting and defeating any and all challengers seemed very... questionable. Then Saihung was given a quest by the Grand Master- to track down and bring back a former student of the monastery who has gone into the world to become a thief, a slaver, and a murderer. And so he sets out on his knightly quest among the last remnants of the old martial order in a corrupt and decaying society. He travels through both the criminal and martial underworlds to find his quarry. It is along the way that he finds that not even a knight who is pure of heart can use force and killing without paying a heavy inner price.<br /><br />It is after the completion of this quest that Saihung once again leaves the monastery- and finds himself drawn into the same criminal underworld as his former prey. He finds himself drawn by the dark Tao into a life of force, pride, and sensation. He sinks so low as to become an actor in traditional Chinese opera because he is addicted to applause and adoration. It is there that he encounters two legendary wandering Taoist Immortals and realizes the error of his ways. It is in the last section of the book that the most profound lessons come. He sees the proper place of lesser teachings and lesser realities in following the Path. He learns to look beyond mere technical knowledge, intellectualism, and the letter of sacred literature- and to not confuse them with the goal. It is here that he reconnects with the Tao.<br /><br />Once again, after reading this book I have absolutely no doubts that the author has studied with a true Master.<br /><br />3) _Gateway to a Vast World_<br /><br />This final volume of the _Chronicles of the Tao Trilogy_ sees the end of ancient traditions rooted in the Tao- and the planting of old seeds in a new land.<br /><br />Saihung has returned to the great mountain monastery of Haushan. After participating briefly in the new Communist government, he has found that he has no use for the game playing, ruthlessness, and mercilessness of politics. Once again, he has grown world-weary and returned to the life of the renunciate. Only this time the Grand Master refuses to let him stay. With a sense of impending urgency, he tells his youngest student to wander the world in search of experience- and his own destiny.<br /><br />This is how Saihung came to find himself in the America of the 1950's. He had chosen that place because of what he had read in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Pledge of Allegiance. It hit his idealism hard when he found that these ideals didn't apply to people of other races, the poor, the outsiders. Yet, he still stayed on in this strange new land. He found that working in a restaurant wasn't all that different from the daily life in a monastery- if one kept one's interior life centered and focused. He found that this was not always easy in a land so full of violence, hate, and greed. Then, one day the call came from the Grand Master to return to Huashan. When he arrived, he found the monasteries in ruins, the monks scattered, the practice of Taoism outlawed....<br /><br />This is the story of one man's experience on the Way. It is a story of touching on the Source only to have it torn away by the constantly changing currents of the world. Yet, inspite of all the trials, the darkness, and the change, the Way and its lessons remain for the serious seeker to rediscover.

Dreaming is examined from both the point of view of ancient and traditional cultures (Pythagorians, C.G. Jung), and from that of rationalism and experimental science (Aristotle, behaviorists), though the emphasis is obviously on the former and the dream as the gateway to the unconscious- and divine guidance. The approach is cross-cultural and ranges from \\"the shamans of Malaysia, India, or North America; the visionary artists of Europe and East Asia; the traditions of Biblical, Koranic, and classical philosophy; and the ideas of analytical psychology and experimental science.\\"<br /><br />The element that makes this book special (like the rest of the series) is the effective use of illustrations in terms of both quality and quantity. Yet, this emphasis on illustration does not mean that the text has been \\"dumbed down.\\" On the contrary, I think of this as a \\"thinking person's coffee table book.\\"<br /><br />As the text points out, like many ideas temporarily discredited by rationalism, the dream as a voice of inner truth is now being vindicated.	2005-02-03

That is to say that the author has actually experienced the states that he describes and is not merely an academic. This makes it extremely useful to those that are trying to make sense of their own personal experiences. While the book is the outgrowth of a graduate class on Christian Mysticism, the author makes it clear that it could just as well apply to the mystical traditions of any religion ever known.<br /><br />Personally, I am surprised that this book is not better known. When I first found it over a decade ago I considered it a true Godsend (or was it synchronicity?) It has the most down-to-earth, genuine, unpretentious style of any book on the subject that I've found- and yet the author quotes from Bucke's _Cosmic Consciousness_, Tennyson, William James, The Gospel of Thomas, Emerson, the Hermetica, St. Augustine, St. Teresa, Dionysius the Areopagite, Rufus Jones (the Quaker philosopher), Evelyn Underhill, etc., etc., etc. The text itself gives well-organized guidelines that lists specific mystical occurrences, describes methods to attain them, directs the individual towards the methodology best suited to their personality, and gives significant general information to provide a solid foundation for the Great Search. The self-discovery guides at the end of each chapter are especially useful. There is nothing of the \\"fuzzy-minded\\" mystic here (which is remarkable given the difficulty in expressing some of the concepts involved.)<br /><br />There are repeated assurances that you are not alone in your experiences, that most people just aren't going to understand you, and that, historically, you are in good company.

In fact, I have discarded lesser volumes and maintained this one.<br /><br />This one volume covers the formal rites and ceremonies of evocation, spells, alchemy, conjuration, possession, and exorcism. It is very well illustrated with sigils, seals, pentacles, and tools. It is clear to me that much research went into the original grimoires. Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah is a true scholar of the occult.<br /><br />Having said all this, I would warn the would be reader that the majority of this work deals with conjuring supernatural entities and binding them to your will. This is a foolish and dangerous practice. First of all, you are never sure of exactly what you have contacted- no matter what it CLAIMS to be. Secondly, this is a work of ego, an attempt to impose your personal will over the natural order. If your motives are impure or mistaken you risk three-fold retribution back upon yourself. I am not saying that it won't work, but is it worth this price to you?<br /><br />From the text it is clear to me that Shah knew the difference between Theurgia (aligning your will with the Divine will in Its service) and Goetia (using occult power to serve your own ego.) Just be aware of what you are dealing with here, especially in the sections dealing with infernal evocation and demonology. That is why we have free will....	2005-01-23

Examples are used from many different cultures and religious traditions: Christian, Jewish, Sufi, Taoist, Buddhist, Native American, Hindu, etc. The fact that seven paths are delineated is not arbitrary, for seven is the number of spirituality, wisdom, magic, perfect order, and the macrocosm. There are seven notes to the musical scale, seven heavens, seven pillars of wisdom, seven charisms, seven branches to the tree of life, seven sacred directions to the medicine wheel, seven chakras....<br /><br />Path One is the path of earth and home- that of the everyday mystic. This is the nature-centered path of those that see heaven reflected in the natural world.<br /><br />Path Two is the path of creativity and abundance- that of generosity of the spirit. This is the path of tantric yoga, the divine marriage, of losing- and finding- yourself through selflessly giving yourself to another.<br /><br />Path Three is the path of \\"how can I help\\"- the passion to serve. This is the path of selfless service to all of humanity as potential co-creators with God.<br /><br />Path Four is the way of the heart- bridging earth and heaven. This is the inner path of the heart where one truly loves the Divine with all their heart, soul, and mind (bhakti yoga.) The practitioner here literally becomes the meeting point of heaven and earth through pure devotion.<br /><br />Path Five is that of discipline, ethics, and will- thy will, not mine, be done. This is raja yoga- God-Union by following specific moral principles or laws that preserve the community, honor life, and lead to personal growth. It is an attempt to put our human will into accordance with the divine will through discipline and obedience.<br /><br />Path Six is the opening of the wisdom eye- contemplation and transformation. This jnana yoga, the path of insight. This is the path of the dark night of the soul- of deep introspection- and of ego death. Ideally, it is the path of spiritual death and rebirth.<br /><br />Path Seven is the way of faith- paradox and grace. This is God-union given as a gift from above, and not as a \\"reward\\" for works. Paradoxically this deals with both perfect faith in the Divine, as well as, the gift of absolute knowledge in the reality of the Divine.<br /><br />The author points out that no one path is more advanced than another. Nor are they mutually exclusive for one may represent our primary path (the path on which we fulfill our soul purpose), while another is our secondary (that which heals an inner wound and supports our primary.) Our individual personality, stage of personal growth, and cultural background determines what path we are on. Yet the goal of all these paths is ultimately the same whether we call it God-Union, the Great Mystery, or the Tao.the path of the dark night of the soul- of deep introspection- and of ego death.

When I first picked this volume up it was because I saw Neil Gaiman and Clive Barker's names on the cover. Then, on first perusal, I saw that Gaiman had not even written the introduction. Moreover, Barker's only contribution was the frontispiece- a drawing of Death. Nor did I immediately recognize the names of any of the contributors to the collection. I felt cheated. I jumped to the conclusion that this was a hack written collection of short stories intended to exploit the popularity of the Sandman series. I threw the book down in disgust.<br /><br />Then, a little over a year later, I came back to it. Upon actually reading it, I discovered that Gaiman handpicked these stories. Indeed, he actually wrote the brief introductions for each writer and story. As for the stories themselves, there are some hauntingly, lovingly, skillfully, written tales here. What is more important, most of them genuinely capture the atmosphere of the Dreaming from the graphic novels. I could not have been more wrong about this fine collection- it was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />These stories are so faithful to the original that the reader might want to read the entire 10 volume Sandman Library before attempting it. There is much here that assumes a familiarity with the entire series.	2005-01-20

It is also perhaps the best introduction to Jungian analysis itself, for such analysis is essentially educating people to hear their inner voice and follow it with the help of dreams.<br /><br /> As for those who dismiss dreams as trivial things that reflect their own wishes, or worse yet, mere static and ephemera from their daily lives- why then do so many dreams deal with what we hate hearing? Why do dreams carry eternal archetypical symbolism of which the conscious mind has absolute ignorance? No, dreams have a superior intelligence to them that goes far beyond that possessed by the conscious mind.<br /><br />  Dreams take us into mysteries of nature absolutely strange to our rational mind. Thank God, that they do, for our hyper-rational, materialistic, mass-statistical worldview is killing us- both as individuals and as a viable civilization. Dreams are the way that our inner center, our Self, can make connection with our ego consciousness. This connection is always an attempt to tell us how we are off-balance. The central message is always what path that we need to follow to balance and stabilize our personality.<br /><br /> The basic fundamentals of Jungian theory are fully explained in the text: the basic archetypes of the shadow, the anima, the animus, the Self; the concept of complexes; the goal of individuation, etc. The greatest part of the book is involved in case studies of actual dreams, however. While there is a danger of applying individual case studies to other unique cases this danger is pointed out. Every dream is unique, because every dreamer is absolutely unique.	2005-01-16

In a sense this book mirrors the work that he did in his _The Eternal Journey_, for just as that book is an extremely well-structured and organised unified theory of the afterlife, this book is a true unified theory of the way earthly society functions (or malfunctions.)<br /><br />Everything is pretty much derived from his Law of Spiritualty, which states that there is a creator and an afterlife. It is made very clear that spirituality is separate from any particular dogma or church affiliation.<br /><br />The second part of the book points out what has gone wrong with American society, along with steps to put it right based on the Laws expounded in the first half. Using a very comprehensive and well documented rating scale the author ranks societies from high well-being (utopian), to moderate well-being (functional), to poor well-being (stalemated), to minimal well-being (dysfunctional). He places the United States in the \\"stalemated\\" catagory on its way to \\"dysfunctional\\"- unless remedial steps are taken.<br /><br />I found this to be the most satisfying study of social behavior that I have ever read.	2005-01-15

Lovecraft. Then I looked up the original date of publication (1908), which is several decades before Lovecraft published. Obviously it was Hodgson that influenced Lovecraft.<br /><br /> I wouldn't hesitate to call this one of the best otherworldly and weird books ever written. It is not graphic blood and guts splatter- Edwardian gentlemen did not write such [stuff]. This is something far better. Besides the psychological terror that builds, you have cosmically mind boggling themes of infinate time and space- and the world beyond this world, of which ours is but a pale inferior shadow.<br /><br /> I often wonder just who William Hope Hodgeson was. He was plainly a man of action, that much is clear from his battle with the pig demons, but he was also something more. I wonder what forgotten corner of the Empire he picked up his knowlege of things cosmic and beyond the veil....	2005-01-14

In fact, this was the volume that introduced me to the forgotten world of popular 19th century lithographed prints when I experienced a strange sense of deja vu while flipping through it. That is what is revealed here- a forgotten world of America as she saw herself between the years of 1835 and 1907. These prints were sold for as little as six cents apiece when they were first published. They enabled the average man to bring artwork into his home and life at a price that he could afford. Indeed, these prints were the ubiquitous backdrop to the 19th century, since they could be found adorning the walls of barrooms, barbershops, firehouses, and hotels, as well as the homes of rich and poor alike.<br /><br />The book starts with a good concise history of the firm and it's founders, as well as, a brief description of the lithography process itself. Next, brief biographies are included of the principle artists (when the book was first published the author had actually known some of them in their later years.) Then there is a section of brief descriptions of the prints on the included plates indexed by number. There are 192 plates; each containing between one and four reduced sized reproductions of the original prints. Approximately one in five plates are reproduced in the rich, full color of the originals.<br /><br />The subject matter included in this selection is very representative of the firm's output and includes: landscape views, political cartoons and banners, portraits, historical prints, moral and religious prints, prints for children, country and pioneer home scenes, humor, sheet music, Mississippi river prints, railroad prints, horse prints, sporting events, and ship prints. Yet even this is only a small sampling of Currier and Ive's output since they claimed to have produced on average three new prints a week for over fifty years. Unfortunately the company itself did not maintain the most complete record of its own production- unknown prints still turn up to this day.rints a week for over fifty years.

It is inaccurate and an injustice. It is a strange sort of fanatic that hates the inquisition and the witch hunters, as much as he does necromancers and murderers. Kane is in the ancient British and Irish tradition of a man who goes forth to wander the world after he receives the call- guided solely by his deep inner trust in his God. That is why he can walk the dark and wild places of the earth unscathed. That is why monsters and devils hold no terror for him. He simply trusts in the Lord to guide him to where he can do the most good. Kane is a Puritan in the original sense of the word, a single individual that has no tolerance for corruption whether it exists in the World- or the Church. He doesn't preach, for he doesn't need to- his actions, and his sword, speak for him. He needs no priest to mediate between himself and his Creator. Kane has gone beyond faith, for his is the sure and implacable knowledge that God exists. This is what makes him such a dangerous foe- you can't scare him and you can't make a deal with him. He obeys only the inner voice that guides him. I can see why the weak and corrupt would paint such a man as a fanatic.<br /><br />Solomon Kane was Howard's first creation. In my opinion, he was also his best. There is an element present here that is missing from the later characters- something higher.<br /><br />This particular collection includes the later Kane stories:<br /><br />The Hills of the Dead,<br /><br />Hawk of Basti,<br /><br />The Return of Sir Richard Grenville,<br /><br />Wings in the Night,<br /><br />The Footfalls Within,<br /><br />The Children of Asshur,<br /><br />and Solomon Kane's Homecoming.<br /><br />The rest of the tales were published by Bantam Books in _Solomon Kane: Skulls in the Stars_.	2005-01-13

It made me begin to see reality in a new, larger, manner- it began to shake loose my preconceptions. Now, when I review it, I find the concepts to be commonplace. How could I have ever thought otherwise? That's a measure of the transforming process that it began in me. This book will start you on the climb to a new intellectual plateau. Even synchronicity, which I had the hardest time accepting, is now a \\"given\\" for me.<br /><br />Rucker is a highly effective writer- for a mathematician. His prose is clear, readable, and humorous. Plus, he examines the subject from mathematical, scientific, philosophical, and spiritual perspectives. His use of relevant quotes throughout the work is excellent- plus there is a very good bibliography for further study.<br /><br />If you do feel the need for further study (and you will) then try _Exploring the Fourth Dimension_ by Ralphs, or _Extra Dimensional Universe_ by Violette. Then perhaps you may feel up to eventually tackling _Tertium Organum_ by Ouspensky, and _The Multiple States of Being_ by Guenon.	2005-01-09

What struck me most about this book is how non-dated it was for having been written in 1933. First of all, the story starts in Afghanistan during an airlift to evacuate foreign nationals during an anti-western revolution. Next, the main characters are essentially skyjacked to an unknown destination against their will for unknown purposes. As for the characters, they seem very familiar and contemporary also: a world-weary and burned-out government bureaucrat, a gung-ho and impatient young military officer, a business man that has stolen over 100 million dollars from investors through stock fraud, and a fundamentalist Christian missionary that believes in one \\"true\\" religion and holds all others in contempt. There is also the conviction among several of these characters that globally \\"the whole game's going to pieces.\\"<br /><br />However, there is also something hauntingly timeless about this story. It occurs to me that the hidden civilization of Shangri-La is based on the mythical kingdom of Shambhala, where immortal masters live that look after the evolution and welfare of mankind. The great mountain of Karacul that looms over the valley also seems symbolic of Mt. Meru- the axis of the cosmos- and where the gods are reputed to dwell. It is certainly no coincidence that most of the people that find Shangri-La are the world weary- and the journey comes close to killing them. That would seem to be a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment. For this is what the lucky and the worthy find in Shangri-La, all the time in the world, or rather out of the world, for contemplation, preservation of all the worthy attainments of the human race, and the pursuit of wisdom. Sounds pretty close to heaven to me....<br /><br />An interesting side note is the fact that _Lost Horizon_ was the first paperback title ever published by Pocket Books in 1939. This particular edition bears the same classic cover art as the original.	2004-12-29

Such things are of value only if they are obtained in the pursuit of the highest Good. This highest Good is demonstrated to be God. Moreover, Boethius points out that when evil men succeed in obtaining such goals over the righteous, then they cease to truly be men- they are beasts and subhuman. This is a refreshing reminder in the modern world, a world not unlike that of late Roman times.<br /><br />All happyness, all worth, all reason for being, lies in the One and the Good. Even when we commit immoral acts, it is a result of ignorance on our part in seeking this ultimate goal. Indeed, to turn from the quest of finding the One is to cease to exist at any meaningful level.<br /><br />There is no \\"fire and brimstone\\", or talk of eternal torment in hell here. There doesn't need to be. As long as you willfully or ignorantly stray from the Path then you are in hell. And to not find reconnection with the One and the Good is to cease to exist. All of our earthly existence is for the purpose of reawakening to our true nature. This truth lies within all of us and it is only reached by personal introspection (Know thyself.) Only in this way will we return to the eternal Source that lies beyond time itself.<br /><br />The consolation of the Consolatio lies in the fact that suffering serves a purpose if it puts us back on the true Path. Moreover, earthly recognition of virtue is irrelevent. God always recognises the man of virtue if the masses do not.	2004-12-27

In fact, it is probably one of the easiest systems of divination to use- you simply concentrate on a \\"yes or no\\" question and thumb the pages until your intuition tells you to open it. There you will find your answer- and a little bit more.<br /><br />Over the years I have used several divination systems (Tarot, I Ching, the Runes, and a couple more) but I was always curious about bibliomancy. It appears to be a form of \\"controlled synchronicity\\" as valid as any of the others- though limited to the degree of information that it can impart.<br /><br />The book itself is a high quality artifact. You would swear that it is antique leather bound volume at first examination. It is a thick volume, but since it lacks page numbers, I cannot say exactly how thick. I know that people can't seem to keep their hands off of it, so it would probably make a great gift. An entertaining gesture might be to send it to a friend anonymously, to add a little mystery to their lives.	2004-12-21

This is the first of the eight book series based on the Tom Corbett radio and television series of the 1950's. This series was closely based on Robert Heinlein's _Space Cadet_ novel. In fact, the book reads very much like a Heinlein \\"juvenile.\\" The technical advisor on the series was Willy Ley, the German aerospace pioneer and visionary.<br /><br />This book introduces all the major characters from the series Tom Corbett, Roger Manning, Astro, Captain Strong, etc. In fact, it starts off with Corbett's admission to the Solar Academy and his first missions as a member of the Solar Guard. The Guard are the peacekeepers for the three planet civilisation of the Solar Alliance (Earth, Mars, Venus- and also the moons of Luna, Titan, and Ganymede.)<br /><br />I found this to be a truly inspiring series when I was younger- and it is still a good, tight read today.

When this young man died in battle in 1863 he had put down the largest and bloodiest civil war in human history (the American Civil War raging at the same time pales in comparison), he had been made a general and a mandarin, he had married a Chinese princess, and he was interred in his own temple. Perhaps most impressively was the fact that he did all of this while retaining the reputation among his friends and foes of being a man of decency, fairness, honor and incorruptibility. And yet for all this, he is nearly forgotten in both his native and adopted country.<br /><br /> Frederick Townsend Ward's history was erased largely because he was feared by both his Manchu masters and by the European powers that were seeking to dismember China for their own mercenary ends. The author speculates that due to his contempt for the cruelty and corruption of the Manchu's, that had he survived, he might have turned the instrument of his \\"Ever Victorious Army\\" against them in order to restore the Ming Dynasty. Had that happened, the history of China could have far different in the century that followed.  It is clear that Ward found the concept of ending the Empire as unthinkable- which is why the later republic never honored his memory.<br /><br /> One other thing struck me while reading this book: Ward wanted to attend West Point but was not able to obtain an appointment because he lacked \\"connections.\\" In the long run this didn't seem to hurt him too much....<br /><br /> If this story were fiction it would surely be dismissed as too far-fetched to ever be believed.	2004-12-18

This is one of the few books that I have had qualms about reviewing. It is so morbidly fascinating that it is hard to set aside. It doesn't appear to have been written exclusively for psychiatric professionals- the style is too readable and the statistics are too readily useful and understandable.<br /><br /> The first part of the book does a good job in examining the history, philosophy, study approaches, and reasons for suicide. The author makes it quite clear that he does not automatically consider suicide to be inappropriate in all cases, nor does he automatically rule out the existence of rational suicide. There are also an excellent couple of chapters on the subject of euthanasia and its application in other cultures.<br /><br />It is the second part of this volume that has made it famous, or infamous, in the mental health world. While the author clearly states on the flyleaf that the book should not be considered a \\"how to\\" guide, it is difficult to imagine how anyone could not foresee that this is exactly how it could be used. The author devotes a chapter to each and every means of self termination and then sums each up each method with pros and cons (asphyxia, cutting and stabbing, drowning, drugs and poisons, electrocution, gunshot wounds, hanging and strangulation, hypothermia, and jumping.) The chapters give quite detailed descriptions of how to successfully carry out these acts and the odds of your being successful. For instance, not only are you told specifically where to shoot yourself, but also the individual effectiveness of the various calibers of bullet is examined. The old hangman's formula for determining the height of drop for a given weight is included. There is even a table to calculate the exact velocity at which you will hit the ground based on the starting elevation of a jump (he points out as a rule of thumb that a jump of 150 feet on land and one of 250 feet over water is 95 to 98% fatal.) The only thing that makes me think that such a detailed guide is not a how-to book is the fact that he also gives detailed descriptions of the horrible injuries resulting from botched attempts. To be more effective in this respect, perhaps photographs should have been included.<br /><br />If this book keeps individuals from suffering the traumatic effects of botched suicide then it is a worthy effort. Similarly, if it helps those that merely intend a survivable suicide \\"gesture\\" from going too far it will also have served its purpose. There has been a concerted campaign on the part of some mental health professionals to remove this book from circulation. I can't say that I approve of that effort, but I would definitely keep it out of the hands of minors and the mentally unstable.a detailed guide is not a how-to book is the fact that he also gives detailed descriptions of the horrible injuries resulting from botched attempts.

Once again, he has grown world-weary and returned to the life of the renunciate. Only this time the Grand Master refuses to let him stay. With a sense of impending urgency, he tells his youngest student to wander the world in search of experience- and his own destiny.<br /><br />This is how Saihung came to find himself in the America of the 1950's. He had chosen that place because of what he had read in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Pledge of Allegiance. It hit his idealism hard when he found that these ideals didn't apply to people of other races, the poor, the outsiders. Yet, he still stayed on in this strange new land. He found that working in a restaurant wasn't all that different from the daily life in a monastery- if one kept one's interior life centered and focused. He found that this was not always easy in a land so full of violence, hate, and greed. Then, one day the call came from the Grand Master to return to Huashan. When he arrived, he found the monasteries in ruins, the monks scattered, the practice of Taoism outlawed....<br /><br />This is the story of one man's experience on the Way. It is a story of touching on the Source only to have it torn away by the constantly changing currents of the world. Yet, inspite of all the trials, the darkness, and the change, the Way and its lessons remain for the serious seeker to rediscover. One has only to persevere to the edge of oblivion itself....	2004-12-15

While reading this second book in the author's _Chronicles of the Tao Trilogy_ it repeatedly occurred to me that it lacked the depth and meaning of the first volume. It seemed to have degenerated to a martial arts morality play. However, having finished reading the last section, I now see that I was wrong. This is even more powerful than the first book, for it is a tale of slipping from the Path of the Tao having once touched upon it. It is a story of striving, falling, and re-ascending.<br /><br />The book starts with some excellent discussions on the nature of Taoism and the Tao. But after that it quickly switches to a description of martial arts training and how it intersects with the spiritual lives of the monks of Huanchan. Indeed, the pride of some of the monks, even the Grand Master, at meeting and defeating any and all challengers seemed very... questionable. Then Saihung was given a quest by the Grand Master- to track down and bring back a former student of the monastery who has gone into the world to become a thief, a slaver, and a murderer. And so he sets out on his knightly quest among the last remnants of the old martial order in a corrupt and decaying society. He travels through both the criminal and martial underworlds to find his quarry. It is along the way that he finds that not even a knight who is pure of heart can use force and killing without paying a heavy inner price.<br /><br />It is after the completion of this quest that Saihung once again leaves the monastery- and finds himself drawn into the same criminal underworld as his former prey. He finds himself drawn by the dark Tao into a life of force, pride, and sensation. He sinks so low as to become an actor in traditional Chinese opera because he is addicted to applause and adoration. It is there that he encounters two legendary wandering Taoist Immortals and realizes the error of his ways. It is in the last section of the book that the most profound lessons come. He sees the proper place of lesser teachings and lesser realities in following the Path. He learns to look beyond mere technical knowledge, intellectualism, and the letter of sacred literature- and to not confuse them with the goal. It is here that he reconnects with the Tao.<br /><br />Once again, after reading this book I have absolutely no doubts that the author has studied with a true Master.s and lesser realities in following the Path.

I was pleasantly surprised at how smoothly this text flows, but then perhaps I should have expected this from a work so full of the true essence of the Tao. Primarily, this is the story of the education of a Taoist adept and renunciate from willful child to a master who is fully in harmony with heaven and earth. Secondarily, it is a glimpse into the intact monastic community of the Haushan mountains- before its dissolution in the post-Imperial chaos of the 20th century.<br /><br />There is more than a little Taoist wisdom interwoven into the story. Indeed, it is a fine teaching aid. You get a sense of the careful guiding and molding of young Kwan Saihung by the Grand Master. Basic Taoist ethics, meditation, internal alchemy, healing, martial arts, divination, astral travel- are all touched upon. You get a sense of both the mundane and tedious groundwork of monastic life, as well as, the ego-shattering elements of crisis and initiation.<br /><br />The advice concerning the purging of one's ming huan (karma) is especially refreshing in today's world. You came into this world with problems and dilemmas to be met and mastered. You are to burn away all your attachments and worldly goals, purge desire, and satisfy the thirst for knowledge (the exact opposite of the teachings of modern materialism.) You never refuse experience, and you overcome all obstacles that such experience presents. In this way you can leave this word fulfilled and pass to a higher plane.<br /><br />Saihung's anger at the Japanese invasion of the 30's- and his decision to leave the order and fight as a \\"wandering Taoist\\"- is more than a little appropriate in today's world. After years of soul-numbing combat he returned to the monastery. He had come to realize the ultimate corruption of the outer world and the meaninglessness of war. He came to realize that humanity had to work out their own destiny- including war- and that no Taoist (or even the Jade Emperor) could do it for them.	2004-11-29

I had heard about this novel and the rest of the \\"Dark Tower\\" series for a couple of decades but I just never found time to get to them. I now see why King considers the series to be the core of his life's work. There is something mythological here, but not in any contrived and self-conscious way. The author ruminated on this book in his sub conscious for a dozen years before publishing- and that extra time for germination shows. This is no slapped together popular potboiler. King admits that he doesn't elaborately outline and plan his novels in his head, that they just flow through him in the spontaneous act of writing. So what we have here seems to be a direct channeling from somewhere else. I know it seemed familiar to me when I read it, just as Burroughs's \\"Place of Dead Roads\\" and \\"Cities of the Red Night\\" seemed familiar. It also struck me as very similar to the \\"macro dimensions\\" in Gold's _The American Book of the Dead_. It would seem that when we cross over to the worlds that exist beyond this one, we tend to carry the artifacts and landscapes along with us that we are most familiar with- including Gunslingers and the West.<br /><br />As for the world of the Gunslinger, it is \\"passing on\\"- for there is something fundamentally wrong with time and the fabric of existence itself. Everything is decaying and dissolving. The social fabric is unraveling and mutants and dark magicians freely wander the land. The old order of the King of Light and his gunfighter guardians is no more- Roland is the last of them. It is now his mission to find out what is happening that caused his world, and perhaps the rest of existence to collapse. To do that he must find the mythical Dark Tower. And to find that he must hunt down the Man in Black.<br /><br />What struck me here is the timelessness of King's model of the cosmos. We are told of the existence of countless worlds or dimensions. Yet all these worlds are connected by a tower- this is obviously the Axis Mundi, the tree or mountain at the center of creation. It is dark in this case, because this is a vision of a sick, decaying universe. In mythology it is the shaman that ascends and descends this great central pillar to try to bring order and balance back to creation. However, in King's version it is dark magicians that come and go. He even has the subterranean descent before ascension correct.<br /><br /> Oh yes, a measure of the corruption of this world is the hero, Roland, himself. He is the last Gunslinger, the last crusader- yet he is also a murderer and betrayer....<br /><br />Now that I understand the entire series is completed, I look forward to finishing it.mountain at the center of creation.

I found them to be both inspiring and comforting- this would make a great collection of bedtime tales for either children or adults.<br /><br />There is just something consistently inspiring about the Immortals. They all share the same core characteristics: interest in the Tao at an early age, the shunning of fame and fortune, generosity, and the living of simple and unencumbered lives. Even when approached by the Emperor with high position and riches the typical Taoist immortal responds with \\"thanks, but no thanks.\\" And if they do accept the task of advising a great lord for the good of the empire, they get out before the decline and the purges start. Oh yes, and they almost always have an excellent sense of humor.<br /><br />The stories are divided into the Eight Immortals (the archetypical patterns of what it means to be an immortal); the Sages (the greatest of the scholars and patriarchs to achieve immortality- including Lao-Tzu, Chang-Tzu, Wen-Tzu, and the Yellow Emperor); Magicians; Diviners; and Alchemists.<br /><br />If you think that you know something of Chinese culture through chop-socki films and Chinatown, you owe it to yourself to immerse yourself in this book. You'll find yourself much closer to the heart than to the fringes. And there is more than a little Taoist wisdom to be absorbed here.<br /><br />\\"Whether you are a noble or a commoner, rich or poor, famous or unknown- at best you'll end up as a ghost.

(Evans Novel of the West)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Reputation is a double-edged sword	I found this book to be one of the best-written character studies of the gunfighter/lawman on the western frontier. It just doesn't retell the stock tall-tales and legends- it shows the reality of what living a life of constant danger in dangerous places does to a person. The book's protagonist, Clay Halser, is a fictional character, but readers will recognize in his exploits a combination of Billy the Kid, Wild Bill Hickok, and Wyatt Earp. But primarily, Halser is based on Hickok's life. Indeed, Hickok as a character and contemporary shows up repeatedly in the story, which gives it a bit of a surreal edge at times. One of my favorite scenes is Hickok and Halser meeting in a bar room late in their respective careers. Wild Bill tells Halser of his belief in spiritualism and of talking with the dead- an experience that Halser has also shared but tried to dismiss as the effects of drink.<br /><br />Don't expect any overt heroism in this story. Halser is presented as pretty much a victim of circumstances that got caught up in a violent environment that was almost completely out of his control. Yet, since was also an adrenaline junkie, who just couldn't stay on the farm after his experiences in the Civil War, he also eagerly sought out \\"exciting places\\"- at first. You see, at first Halser was the sort of man of action who didn't even think of death or danger when threatened- he just automatically reacted. Later on, largely as a result of keeping the journal that this story is based on, he started to reflect on his actions and mortality after the fact. At the height of his legend he simply became numb- he was a walking killing machine doing what was \\"expected\\" of him. In his later years, he lived in a state of constant anticipation and frayed nerves. That's a lesson that jumps out at you- a man's nerves will only stand so much in a lifetime- and when they are finally shot you NEVER get your old composure completely back.<br /><br />This is also an excellent study of 19th century law enforcement. If the right person was caught and punished for a crime it was almost an accident. All that was important was catching somebody (anybody) and hanging (often literally) the crime on them. The average western lawman was often recruited from the criminal element to protect the rich and well connected from people very much like himself. As City Marshall, Halser kept the drunken and violent of his side of the \\"dead line\\"- and the decent people didn't even want him or his family on the other side of that line. Otherwise Halser saw to it that no one got too out of hand in the business establishments (usually saloons and whorehouses) on his side of the line- and collected a share of the profits to do so. That's another thing that jumps out at you about Hauser- he never really seemed to have much of a sense of, or pride in, protecting the weak and innocent or upholding justice. It was just a job, or an opportunity to relieve boredom by buffaloing and outdrawing other violent men. It was a chance to build on his reputation and legend- which came back to haunt and hound him in his later years. You see that's all he really had in the end to justify and comfort him, his personal legend- and the vast majority of that was based on circumstances out of his control, exaggerations, and out-right lies.<br /><br /> Clay Halser died in a barroom gunfight a worn out old man- at the age of 31.....rcement.

Personally, I thought that the four issue mini-series \\"Saint of Killers\\" deserved it's own separate trade paperback. Lumping the other material in here doesn't really fit or make sense. The story arc works perfectly by itself- hell, it's a masterpiece of graphic story telling. Moreover, you don't need to know anything about the rest of the Preacher series to appreciate it- either before or after. I remember when I first found this miniseries- my reaction was Wow, this is really GOOD! I reread it three times and then sent a fan letter to Ennis (which he probably never got.)<br /><br />What we have here is an interesting union of real world, western myth, and cosmic myth. We never learn the name of the \\"Saint\\", he is always \\"that man\\"- or Sir! We do learn his story though- from Gettysburg to the Llano Estacada- from Confederate cavalryman to bounty hunter. He was a hard man, but a fair one. While he hunted down bad men for bounty (red and white) he never saw himself as any sort of hero. He treated good folk with respect and decency- but primarily he just wanted to be left alone. Then he rescued a good woman from the hands of a Kiowa raiding party- and for eight years he enjoyed a peaceful, full family life that he suspected that he had no true right to. That all came to an end in the Great Blizzard of '86. While he was riding to get medicine for his sick wife and child he was delayed by a gang of murderous scum. He made it back to them too late. Only one thing remained for him- vengeance against those who had kept him from his mission. He tracked them down and got his vengeance- but he knowingly and deliberately killed an innocent soul that got in the way while he was doing so. Before that, his soul had been balancing on a knife's edge- neither a good man nor a strictly bad man- just a hard man. And so he died before killing the leader of the outlaws- and his soul went straight to Hell.<br /><br />Yet, that wasn't the end. So cold was his heart, so perfect was his hatred, that Hell itself literally froze over in his presence. Even the Devil himself couldn't whip the hatred from him. The doors of Hell were frozen shut and the Devil himself was frightened. It was then that the Angel of Death offered to trade places with the newcomer. He would walk the earth harvesting souls and doing God's bidding- when death and Divine Wrath were called for. To this end the Angel's sword was melted down to make two Walker Colts....hatred, that Hell itself literally froze over in his presence. Even the Devil himself couldn't whip the hatred from him.

I was not quite sure what to make of this set when I decided to order it. The deciding factor was seeing Martin Palmer's name associated with it- I knew how he felt about shallow \\"new age\\" exploitation of the Tao and of Chinese culture. My trust in his integrity was rewarded.<br /><br />Before I received this oracle I was familiar the most of the other methods used through the centuries in China: tortoise shell, yarrow stalk, coin, flipping randomly through the classics- but I was not familiar with any fired clay tiles. The text, however, points out that such a method was first used some 5000 years ago. That is what this modern system is based upon- 16 tiles chosen at random. There are two duplicate sets of pieces, one in black and one in slate. The first three in each set are incised with the symbols for Tao, Ying, and Yang- the remaining five are marked with the symbols for water, fire, earth, metal, and wood. All sixty-four possible combinations are indexed with interpretations (meditations, really) in the included booklet.<br /><br />The quality of manufacture is excellent- the stones appear to be made of a high quality ceramic material (no crumbling or flaking), the included booklet is a quality printed hardcover- tastefully designed and illustrated, the bag for the stones feels like red silk (though it isn't) and is covered with gold embroidered dragons, and the black lacquered case appears to be well done.	2004-11-14

Indeed, Lao Tzu was not a Taoist. He did not see himself as the founder of a religion. When it comes right down to it, the term \\"Tao\\" had been in use for centuries, if not millennia, before the Tao Te Ching was compiled.<br /><br />What I found especially satisfying was the connection that is shown between Shamanism (the actual, primordial Siberian Shamanism) and Taoism. You see, the fundamental core essence of Shamanism is belief in two worlds that exist side by side. The spirit world affects our own lesser, material world- and an intermediary is needed to maintain harmony and balance between them. That is also the heart of Taoism- a harmonious union between heaven and earth. Only, in official Taoism, the emperor served as intermediary. Yet the goal of Taoist sage is essentially shamanistic- to obtain union and harmony with the highest, deepest, hidden currents of the universe. When this was achieved, one was in a state of wu-wei, where one's own will and the will of heaven were one and indistinguishable.<br /><br />The other aspects of traditional Taoism are covered- the moral code, the formal liturgy, the quest for immortality and alchemical path, as well as associated later beliefs in magic and exorcisms. The stories of the great sages and immortals are here. So are the foundation myths of the Three August Ones and the Five August Emperors. The various teachers, schools, and canons that developed over the years are briefly outlined. What jumped out at me was the fact that the original, philosophical core of Taoism should not be confused with the formal religion and folk beliefs that sprang up afterwards.<br /><br />Of course, the fact that there has been no emperor, no true mediator, on the Altar of Heaven for a century now makes one wonder about the chaos and confusion of our modern world. It was a basic tenet of formal Taoism that if the Mandate of Heaven was not working, then it could not be Heaven's fault- the emperor must not be harmony of the Tao- or an imposter entirely.<br /><br />I myself await the return of a true Son of Heaven.ntury now makes one wonder about the chaos and confusion of our modern world.

I am soooo glad that this book was finally published- and that it was executed so well! This is more than perhaps the all time best example of personal spiritual exploration by a major writer- it is a storage battery of spiritual energy.

It is a shame that probably not one American in thousand will \\"get\\" it- and even fewer outside the culture.<br /><br />It is obvious to me that Jack understood the Dharma. He also had the concept of Tao intuitively nailed.

It is just the sort of tale that I look for to read before the hearth on a chilly autumn evening. This is a story in the classic tradition of the quest.<br /><br />It starts out in Midwinter in a land where the wolves are truly at the door. Danger threatens, winter lingers on and on, and the peoples of the land have come to doubt that there ever was a time of order and summer- or for that matter if there ever was a great King Silverlance.<br /><br />Yet, in the way of these things, a sign appears, a new star, and the satyr, Byron Thorn, heeds the call to follow. Legend tells that such a sign will herald the return of Silverlance to heal the division and disorder in the land and put things right once again. However, Byron finds that there are those who would keep him from the call- those who have succumbed to darkness, and also those who simply cannot conceive of anything greater or better. Yet Byron finds like-minded companions and helpers who aid him on his path to find the King....<br /><br />If you have a love of fantastic characters then you will find them in abundance in this book. You have satyrs and centaurs, dwarfs and dryads, two-headed giants and dragons, plus much, much more. Nor are these beings mere stereotypes and window dressing. You see that not all wolves are bad, not all centaurs are heroic, not all rulers are wise, nor are all wizards good. Plus, you learn that sometimes even the great king needs the help of the humble if he and the land are to be healed.<br /><br />As for those critics that seem to condemn this work for not being a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" or a \\"Harry Potter\\", I say that this book, and hopefully those that will follow, is a valid vision in its own right. It draws upon the same wellsprings of myth and magic.	2004-10-24

What I can say is that this book can stand on its own as a gripping read that holds your interest. I normally do not read novelizations of films but I bought this one on a whim- and I am glad that I did. The author does a remarkable job of writing battle and action scenes in an exciting and believable manner. Plus, I finished this entire three-hundred and fifty page book in a single weekend without once being tempted to set it aside out of boredom- that is a mark of an excellently written piece of historical adventure fiction.<br /><br />The premise that Arthur and his knights were Sarmatian is interesting. Sarmations (from the Black Sea- Caucasus region) did serve in Roman Albion- and around the Wall. Nor is the idea that Romans would uproot a people and place them on a hostile frontier thousands of miles from their home ridiculous- it was common imperial policy. However, there are some questionable historical inaccuracies- if I am not mistaken, Mt. Baden is far to the south where it strategically protects Cornwall and Wales (the traditional area associated with Arthur.) Plus, the Legions left around 407 C.E.- and the Battle of Mt. Baden occurred about 500 A.D. There is also the little fact that the Saxons were INVITED in by the Romanized Britons to REPLACE the withdrawn Legions. In spite of all this I still found the story to be readable and interesting. After all- research DOES place Merlin in the north- perhaps he was a spiritual/war leader of the \\"Picts\\"...<br /><br />I'm not saying that this movie is exactly anti-Catholic, but the Church is portrayed as the enemy of free will and the chief promoter of serfdom in the coming Dark Age. Arthur is however shown to be an enlightened follower of the heretic Pelagius- and fights with an image of an avenging warrior Christ upon his shield. The rest of the Knights are unabashed pagans. Once again, just to be accurate, the idea that the Pope would be commanding Legions during this period does not seem very plausible- unless you are really talking about the Emperor in his role as Pontifex Maximus....pe would be commanding Legions during this period does not seem very plausible- unless you are really talking about the Emperor in his role as Pontifex Maximus....	2004-10-03

Some readers consider the Green Arrow to be one of the more minor components of the DC universe, in spite of the fact that he was one of the earliest Silver Age characters. This excellent graphic novel should make them re-evaluate his importance. I know it confirms my high opinion of the character. Oliver Queen is the living archetype of Robin Hood in the modern world. With no more than consummate mastery of the long bow he still managed to fight side-by-side with beings of almost inconceivable power as a team member and as an equal. In fact, he was always the moral conscience of the Justice League. This was because he was always, above all, the People's Champion. He actually believed in fighting for the underdog with all his being. You have to admire a character who used his great wealth to first fund the JLA- then give it all away to the poor. This man truly was Robin Hood.<br /><br /> This is a story of mythic proportions. It takes place on both the earthly and supernatural planes- in heaven and hell. You have the classic founding Justice League characters, the new members, as well as the shadowy supernatural figures that skirt the margins of this world and the next.<br /><br />I suppose some readers might find it difficult to follow all the characters and story arcs that are touched upon. I managed to keep track of about 90% of it all. The most important thing to keep in mind is that Hal Jordan, the original Green Lantern, was Oliver Queen's best friend. While Jordan went bad and betrayed everything he once believed in (while almost destroying the universe itself) the friendship with Queen remained- in spite of the fact that the latter was forced to try to destroy his old friend to save the totality of existence. This friendship held firm even after both old friends left this world- for both returned to serve a higher purpose.<br /><br />Finally, it surprised me to find that Kevin Smith of \\"Clerks\\" and \\"Jay and Silent Bob\\" fame wrote this story. If this sort of idealism lurks at the bottom of the slacker soul, then perhaps there is still some hope for the world....sort of idealism lurks at the bottom of the slacker soul, then perhaps there is still some hope for the world....   <br />	2004-10-03

The authors connect two of my primary topics of deep life interest- shamanism and the path of the magus in the Hermetic tradition. I mean, I've always sensed the connection, but I've encountered others that just didn't seem to get it.

It is identified that the Hermetic tradition cannot exist without the foundation of the native shamanic tradition, while the shamanic tradition cannot progress without the projection of the Hermetic. One represents the roots, and the other the branches, of the Great Tree.<br /><br />It was truly remarkable how page after page tied together my own interests, studies, and intuitions- it was almost like one long experience of high-level synchronicity. Of course, the forward and high praise by Gareth Knight should be enough to convince most knowledgeable readers that this book is the real thing.<br /><br />You could do far worse than to make this book both your introduction, as well as, your primary text for the study of deep, intuitive, Gnostic, spirituality. I know that this book will be going into my permanent reference collection.	2004-10-03

I think that means something because I've read most of what he published during his lifetime- I used to look forward to the next book of poems, the next novel, year by year. The posthumous collections have been worthwhile in my opinion. This is all stuff that fits the flow of his life narrative. He needed to get it out; it isn't just filler and rejects. There are enough reminiscences about the old days to hold your interest if that was your favorite period of his life (though he makes it clear that to go out and try to live that way when you've got other options is insane.) Buk didn't have a choice and he points out that he was the luckiest man alive to have survived it.<br /><br />As for this being \\"mellow\\" Bukowski, yes, I think he even uses that term in one of the poems. Plus he clearly let his hatred of his father go. However, he also states that he has never really had any peace in his life. Sure, his cancer took some of the fight out of him, but he never surrendered. He says in one poem that you have to \\"accept terrible reality\\", but that doesn't mean he ever surrendered to terrible reality.	2004-09-15

Some called him a murderer and yet others a holy man. For he wandered the world on his mission to track down and eliminate the most profound metaphysical evil and perversion. And in this mission the laws of mankind meant little to him.<br /><br />Yet not even Van Helsing himself knew his true identity. Indeed, he had no memory beyond the night seven years before when he crawled broken and bleeding through the gates of the Vatican. It was on that night that the Knights of the Holy Order admitted him to their secret brotherhood. And so he became the legend, Van Helsing, trained by monks and mullahs from Tibet to Istanbul.<br /><br />Now, seven years later he has finally been summoned to enter Transylvania, the focus of supernatural Evil in the world. He has been sent to find and destroy Count Dracula, son of Satan, Prince of the Earth, and sworn enemy of human kind. For Dracula has made unholy alliance with the greatest scientific mind of his day, Victor Von Frankenstein- and secret of the life force itself would soon be at the service of the King of the Undead and his unholy spawn.<br /><br />I have not seen the film that this novel is based upon, but by itself this is one of the best supernatural fictions that I have read in years. The writing is tight and skillful- especially the action scenes. This is a big step above the usual quality of movie novelizations.	2004-09-05

For such a small book there is an incredible quantity of wisdom here to contemplate. The essays included in this collection are all from Watt's work in the 50's. It becomes clear that this man was not merely ahead of his time- he was beyond time.<br /><br />The Paradox of Self-Denial: This first essay sets the tone for the collection. It is framed around the intuition that \\"He who loseth his soul shall find it.\\" It is pointed out that the seeker that consciously tries to transcend the world, and his own conscious ego, shall never do so. It is only when ego has truly, deeply, experienced defeat, failure, and despair that true transcendence is ever reached. And perhaps not even then, for it comes from beyond the self and is far from predictable.<br /><br />Become What You Are: This essay deals with the concept of the enlightened man as a mirror. This involves grasping nothing/ refusing nothing and receiving all/ keeping nothing. This is detachment from future and past to live in an eternal Now. We are all centered in the infinite Tao- we have all but to recognize it.<br /><br />The Finger and the Moon: One of his most famous essays, it deals with not mistaking religion for the ultimate goal of religion. Once you cross the river, don't try to carry the raft with you on your back.<br /><br />Importance: Deals with the fact that the importance of things has nothing to do with their permanence or duration. Value is in quality and not quantity. The tiniest part of the universe contains that universe in microcosm- and fully participates in the whole.<br /><br />Tao and Wu-Wei: Watts addressed the concept of Wu-Wei long before it became fashionable. This is what works and moves in harmony with nature without having to be forced. Your heart does this- so would your mind if you let it. You just have to get out of your own way. A life, or a society, totally balled-up in rigid self-control and self-consciousness must eventually fail. Wu-Wei means to live with your center outside of this trap.<br /><br />Lightness of Touch: Deals with not taking the world of Maya, or yourself, too seriously. The real world is the play of the spirit.<br /><br />Birds in the Sky: Describes the path of the sage as paradoxically both in harmony with the world, as well as detached from it (in the world but not of it.) Points out that almost all western thought rebels against this as pessimism and nihilism.<br /><br />Walking on the Wheel: Examines the ideal life as 1) stillness, calm, and immovability, and as 2) dancing with the flow of life. Resolves the seeming conflict as a question of relative perception.<br /><br />The Language of Metaphysical Experience: Examines how modern logical philosophy (scientific empiricism and logical positism) simply ignores metaphysical and spiritual issues as \\"meaningless.\\" Points out that such philosophers have no idea what reality is. Shows how materialists are ego driven types who are driven to order and control- and ignore anything that doesn't fit.<br /><br />Good Intentions: Shows how good intentions in and of themselves are not necessarily good- if they are based on ignorance, laziness, incompetence, or misplaced desire.<br /><br />Birth of the Divine Son: Once again, long before it was popular Watts recognized that the symbolism of the Christ long preceded Christianity. The Universal power of the symbol of Spirit entering into union with matter is examined. Also dealt with is the concept of the Second Birth- of the potential for unregenerate man becoming Christ.<br /><br />Even the cover of this book is a spiritual lesson, with its mirror at the center of the mandala, that we may glimpse our Self at the center of creation.of this trap.<br /><br />Lightness of Touch: Deals with not taking the world of Maya, or yourself, too seriously.

I bought this book because I heard that it was about the decline of the aerospace industry in California and how it affected the family of one engineer. This attracted me first of all because my lifetime dream had always been to work in aerospace, preferably in California. The second reason was that I had never achieved this dream and I wanted some indication that it wasn't all that it was cracked up to be- sour grapes on my part. I came away with conflicted opinions. Deep down I didn't want that &quot;Blue Sky Dream&quot; to be over, to be less than my dream. I recognized my own early upbringing in the tale- the worship of Von Braun, the Chesley Bonestell art, the model planes, Tom Swift books, the electronic kits and erector sets, Lost in Space- all of it. Yet, the overall experience was not exactly nostalgia, or if it was, it was a bitter nostalgia.<br /><br /> The author does an extremely good job of capturing the feelings of the time. I knew exactly what he was talking about. The experiences with the wide open, empty world of the new subdivision was mine (though ours was in a former cornfield and not an orchard.) Also, when things began to turn sour and he realized that paradise wasn't all it was cracked up to be I knew exactly what he was describing. However, perhaps because I'm a little older I also identified with his engineer father. While I never made it into aerospace I did make it into less glamorous engineering projects in equally less glamorous surroundings. You see, the rust belt experience is in many ways similar to that of the blue sky belt- but it hit us earlier and harder. My parents lost that suburban ranch. There were no huge government interventions to buy us time; in fact the government siphoned resources out of the rust belt to build the blue sky belt- continously. To be fair, the author does point this out.<br /><br /> I found the book on the whole to be satisfying- if not optimistic. I recognized the ring of truth here. I also recognized the problems that he was describing, especially the sell-out of engineers and workers by a management with no drive or imagination. He is correct in why there was no peace dividend and no retooling of industry into useful peacetime production. It never happened. Moreover, we are now all freelancers with no security, no benefits, no guidance, and no inspiration.<br /><br /> The book is not totally without hope however. The deep, almost mystic, faith of the author's mother speaks to that. That's the remarkable thing about my experience reading this book, for I saw myself in the experiences and attitudes of the father, the son, and the mother at different stages of my own life. Unlike the author I do not see the inherent incompatibility of science on the one hand and mystic faith on the other. You just have to decide what represents a higher reality, and what represents a lower, you just have to get your priorities straight. Maybe one day the whole country will get its priorities straight too.e problems that he was describing, especially the sell-out of engineers and workers by a management with no drive or imagination.

Somehow I missed this book when it first came out- too much was happening in my personal life I guess. Yet, I'm glad that I waited until now to read it, for it serves to verify much that I came to discover on my own from both personal experience and from reading such diverse works as those of the Taoist Sages and Marcus Aurelius. For this is a book of Great Cycles, rooted in the ancient traditional concept of large and small recurrent cycles to human history, as well as to nature.<br /><br /> This book speaks of the Saeculum, to use the ancient term, the great cycles that stretch approximately the span of one long human life. There have been seven of these in the last 500 years of &quot;modern&quot; history. Each of these large cycles is divided into four parts, or &quot;turnings.&quot; Think of them as generational seasons. And then each of these generational turnings is associated with one of the four classical human archetypes (prophet, nomad, hero, and artist.)<br /><br /> When you examine the individual Saeculi you realize that everything has happened before. Time is neither uniquely chaotic, nor is it linear. The same pattern of growth, maturation, entropy, and rebirth occur again and again. The historical documentation is exhaustive- this book serves the secondary function of being an excellent review of Anglo-American history.<br /><br /> It is more than that, though- it is a predictor of what to expect in the rapidly approaching winter or Fourth Turning. Of course, it now looks like winter came too early, for we are trying to cope with it using the techniques and tools of the Third Turning of unraveling and culture war. What we need are the elder statesman or prophets that have guided and inspired us through all our previous periods of crisis. We need our next generation of heroes to come of age. We need time for Merlin to find and teach Arthur. But first, we need the return of the Gray Champion to herald the age.<br /><br /> One other thing, before one becomes too comfortable with the idea that we've always come out of these cycles stronger than the one before, it is best to reflect that Fourth Turnings mean Total War- and we have nuclear devices and material in global abundance....<br /><br /> By the way, the excellent charts and tables make the concepts in the text very easy to rapidly digest., before one becomes too comfortable with the idea that we've always come out of these cycles stronger than the one before, it is best to reflect that Fourth Turnings mean Total War- and we have nuclear devices and material in global abundance....  <br />  <br /> By the way, the excellent charts and tables make the concepts in the text very easy to rapidly digest.	2004-07-31

I say this in the sense that I wish _Mein Kamph_ would have been more widely read. If people would have been more familiar with the author's ideas it would have averted horrible tragedy, and outright evil, in the world. As Ayn Rand is the author most quoted by &quot;libertarians&quot;, &quot;free-traders&quot;, and advocates of &quot;hands off&quot; capitalism this also applies.<br /><br /> Her philosophy of Objectivism is the philosophy of sociopathy, of the ego freed from the restraints of social conscience. All that is important is gratification of the ego. There is no room for community, no room for humanity, no room for God- the individual ego is God. To the objectivist, &quot;altruism&quot;, lending a hand or doing good for it's own sake, is a dirty word. I have heard a leading spokesman for Rand's philosophy denounce Hitler primariy because he was too &quot;altruistic.&quot; Make of that what you will. In our own time, the proponents of unrestrained corporate power, and of the dismantling of elected government, love Rand. They tell you that only governments can &quot;initiate force.&quot; This is the Big Lie- there is no moral difference between shooting a man and starving him to death through economic control of resources- or controlling people through the threat of it. Rand and her objectivists are usually very adept at formal argument and logic. However, their basic premises are so absolutely inhumane that their arguments are mere castles in the air. Castles empty of humanity and God, but filled with evil.<br /><br /> I sometimes wonder what sort of childhood abuse in her native Russia could have warped Rand so seriously. It is obvious that her philosophy is an extreme over reaction to communist collectivism- in the same way that Satanism is an extreme overreaction to Christian fundamentalism	2004-07-31

Eliot stood to inherit control of the vast family fortune through the Rosewater Foundation (a legal entity constructed to shield that fortune from taxation.) But then Eliot went off to WW2 to become a highly decorated Captain of combat infantry. He served with men from all walks of life. Oh yes, he also accidentally bayoneted a 14-year old non-combatant, and afterwards tried to throw himself under a truck. After this he was never the same, much to his rich and powerful family's distress. While he did come back to graduate from Harvard Law and assume control of the foundation, he started behaving...irrationally. He started to actually use the money to HELP people! He also started drinking, wandering, and visiting volunteer firehouses- among other eccentricities.<br /><br /> Eventually, he ended up in Rosewater, Indiana- a depressed backwater that his family had long ago used up and abandoned to found the beginnings of their fortune. He found the people there to be without pride, without hope, without work. So he opened up an office over the liquor store in order to help anyone who needed his help. The sign on the door said simply, &quot;Rosewater Foundation: How Can We Help You?&quot; So Eliot Rosewater, philanthropist, poet, volunteer fireman, Harvard graduate, and drunk proceeded to help any and all that came to him for help.<br /><br /> Needless to say his family could not allow such insanity to continue. Why even Eliot's psychoanalyst came to the conclusion that Eliot was a pervert. The nature of his perversion being the fact that he had channeled all his psychic energy into bringing Utopia to earth for all those in need. What could be more abnormal in modern, capitalist society?<br /><br /> This is my absolute all time favorite Vonnegut novel- and I have read them all.<br /><br /> Oh yes, it also offers one of the best descriptions of the absurdity and injustice of the class system in the U.S. As one of the characters asks, who does run this crazy country?

All he wanted was to be left in peace to finish his next book. However, strange things started happening- from his discovery of a mouse that was not a mouse, to the visit of an old neighbor that was not a man. Or at least he was not an ordinary man. For as it turned out, neither was Jay Vickers.<br />This is the story of human mutation- the next step in the evolution of the species. What if mutants walked among us already? What if they were organized? What if they had unbelievable powers, such as the ability to cross between alternate worlds or dimensions at will, or to intuitively reach the absolutely correct answer by intuition or \\"hunch\\", or to telepathically reach out to the stars? Such supermen would automatically try to conquer lesser men, would they not? Or would they do everything in their power to free the rest of humanity from slavery and suffering? Just what would the political and corporate powers- that- be do to keep their power and their slaves? How would mutants undermine the power of these bosses to set mankind free?<br />This is a story of unlimited freedom, of worlds without end, ready for the taking. It is also the story of powerful, benevolent beings that exist only to help those who need that help. Simak sets this optimism off against the far-flung future- of 1987. This is a future of a lop-sided mechanical culture of technology that could provide creature comfort for a few, but not human justice or security for the many. It is a future of hate, and war, and worry. Nothing like the way the world really turned out....<br />Years ago when I first read this novel the uncanny \\"coincidences\\" with my own life gave me chills.<br />But then, there couldn't really be an underground of mutants working to free humanity... could there?	2004-07-07

Conway has succeeded in showing the proper, traditional interrelation of Goddess and God. Of course, she also points out the patriarchal distortion of the male and female roles in the mainstream Western religions, which no doubt explains the attacks she has drawn from both Fundamentalists and academics that reject the whole matriarchal/patriarchal approach to history. It should be noted that Joseph Campbell raised the same points about western distortion and imbalance in religion.<br />I cannot think of a better book for focusing on the natural balance of male-female energies in the universe. Conway shows that the true, original God was a complex deity, as opposed to the sterile, one-sided, authoritarian idol that was erected in his place. The original God is examined in all of his aspects: divine child, lover and consort, lord of creation, lord of the forest, hero and warrior, trickster, judge, lord of the waters, etc. The examination of his role as sacrificed savior (long before Christianity) is especially interesting. It is enlightening to find that the concept of double birth is symbolized in Dionysus. He who seeks and finds a true spiritual path is granted a second birth- or is &quot;born again.&quot; These are not separate, distinct, non-overlapping aspects of different &quot;gods&quot;, but are all aspects of the one. Indeed, it is shown that even in individual human beings, not only do we all contain these various aspects, but we also contain all the various aspects of God AND Goddess, for each person is fundamentally both male and female to some extent.<br />As for accusations of errors in the supplemental appendix', anyone can use a bad source now and then. Agrippa's three books are full of such errors, yet no one dismisses them. Just take a look at the excellent and extensive bibliography- Conway is a true scholar of understanding and depth.	2004-07-03

Conway succeeds in connecting it with Celtic culture. She understands the core essence of both subjects. Some readers seem to think that she intended some sort of archeological study of &quot;true&quot; Celtic shamanism. This was clearly not the intent, as is stated in both the introduction and in chapter two, &quot;Shamanism: ancient and modern.&quot; She is trying to introduce people to the SPIRIT of shamanism, and in this she richly succeeds. You have to approach this book with an open mind- not unlike the guided visualizations that form an important part of the text.<br />The goal here is to try to heal modern man's almost total disconnect with the heart of nature- and with the deep archetypical powers. The author is correct in stating that we have cut down the World Tree and blown up the tunnel to the Underworld. This book is to identify and steer the sort of individuals who are born to sense and heal this soul-killing divide. It will point the way to the true teachers.<br />For a change Llewellyn assigned a first rate designer and artists to this book- the cover and interior illustrations and details add and do not detract from the whole. Of course, I may be biased here- the frontispiece is the sacred Oak....	2004-07-03

True, you can read it as a simple adventure story of life on a turn-of-the-century seal-hunting schooner, but it is far more than this. It is essentially the story of Wolf Larson- and Wolf Larson is the entire mainstream of 19th and 20th century America in microcosm.<br /> Larson is no simple brute. He is, rather, a complex brute. He is a master of men and a master of the seas- but that is ALL that he is. Larson is an intelligent, driven, ruthless master of industry (in this case, seal hunting.) He has succeeded through his own abilities, hard work, and talent- or so he would have you believe. Truth is, brutal backstabbing, deception, exploitation, and disregard for the law has played an equal measure in his rise and dominance. You see, Larson believes in the rule of the jungle. He believes in it so much that he is driven to prove that this is all there is to existence. He must always seek to degrade and destroy anyone who seeks to rise above this state. This is also why he must disregard the possibility of the existence of a human soul. Larson is an intelligent, hard-nosed materialist that simply cannot conceive of anything beyond a social Darwinist hell of survival of the fittest. And Wolf Larson must be the fittest of them all. As much as money means to Wolf, it is really power over other beings- men and animals that means the most to him. Without this power to sadistically degrade and dominate others, the money would have no meaning. Ultimately that explains why he has risen to command his own vessel at all costs- he is a control freak that MUST be in absolute, totalitarian command of his whole world. This is why he only mans his ship with the lowest, most bestial types of human being, and does everything in his power to make them worse- not unlike many modern corporations. This is also why the sudden presence of a higher sort of individual, with ideals that transcend mere survival and materialism are so totally threatening to him.<br />There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world, his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave.<br />Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle. When he loses his sight and strength, the monsters that he has surrounded himself with turn on him. In the last measure there is nothing great about Larson after all, for in facing death he proves to be a petty, murdering, weakling that would rather take all those around him down with him. It seems that despite his grand pretensions, he was no Lucifer at all, but merely a sick, pathetic, sociopath incapable of making the leap into being truly human.ening to him. <br />There are moments when one is almost tempted to sympathize with the Wolf as a champion of freedom- until you realize that in his sort of world, his \\"freedom\\" means that everyone else must be a slave.<br />Ultimately, the Wolf meets the inevitable fate in a world ruled like the jungle.

Still, a few rebels escaped in the sleeper ships to found free new colonies- or perish in the attempt. Those few colonies that reached inhabitable worlds and survived were cut off for centuries. It was during these centuries of isolation and freedom that they were able to develop the mysterious mental powers that &quot;civilization&quot; had all but destroyed.<br />Finally, when Pax had been eradicated from Earth by the Federation of Free Men, the rockets began to rise once more. This time they they possessed the faster than light drives that would enable them to make up for lost time. One such ship was the RS-10. This ship and its crew stumbled upon the world of Astra and it's strange, ruthless, degenerate, inhuman inhabitants. The Terrans did not trust these creatures but there was much that they could learn from them. Making a temporary alliance the expedition accompanied the aliens to a strange treasure city to help exploit its wonders. It was there that they discovered that the aliens had good reason to fear going to the treasure city alone. It was protected by Free Men who had arrived centuries before....<br />The classic Ace edition of this sci-fi classic has probably the best painted cover of a conventional space ship that I've ever seen.<br />If there had been no other creator of science fiction and fantasy in the second half of the twentieth century, Andre Norton would have been enough.	2004-06-30

For every single nation-state on earth you have the following data: a brief historical background thumbnail sketch, physical geographic details, people (sociologic data), government, economy, communications (infrastructure), transportation (infrastructure), military, and transnational issues (disputes with neighbors and illicit drugs.) Everything is set out in the same standardized format so that it is easy to make comparisons and contrasts between nations. Even the maps are simplified to include only the primary cities and geographic features, so that you do not get overwhelmed with detail. In fact, that is what this book is all about- fast briefing about the basics of any country on earth without overwhelming you. You won't be an &quot;expert&quot; on the culture by any means- but you won't be embarrassingly ignorant, either.<br />One of the most interesting features of this reference is the Gini index- a quick numerical measure of income inequality in a country (and a good measure of political stability.)<br />Oh yes, since the United States is also covered, this work is also a good indication of how the country (or at least the federal government) sees itself at any given moment.	2004-06-28

It is often dismissed as an absurd cult of exaggerated manners- and an equally absurd obsession with romantic love. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Chivalry was the result of mankind's spirit rising from the barbarism of the Dark Ages. Chivalry was the recognition that men did not have to live as animals. Instead of might being used solely in the pursuit of plunder and power, came the ideal that the duty of the mighty was to defend the weak and oppressed. It was the recognition that women were not mere chattel to be used at will, but were the living embodiment of the eternal feminine ideal. The entire age was the triumph of idealism over a hard, bloody, barbaric world. Rules of honorable conduct were brought to warfare. Indeed, all of society was brought to a hierarchical order patterned after the kingdom of heaven. Everything had its rightful place in a divinely inspired order. Everything was holy and deserving of respect. All men had an honorable place in the world, and duty flowed both from the top down, as well as, from the bottom up. Even the tournament was far more than merely a contest of physical prowess- it was based in the unshakable conviction that no knight who was false could triumph in single combat over one who was true.<br /> This book is an excellent examination both the ideal, as well as the reality, of the Age of Chivalry. It is divided into the following sections: the introduction (by Oxford Fellow Jeremy Cato), The Origins of Chivalry, The Art of Courtly Love, and Chivalry in the Late Middle Ages. The many full-color illustrations are beautiful and jewel-like. The overall effect is that of a hand illustrated medieval book. This is a high quality hard cover. There is an attractive, colorful dust jacket. It should be noted that if you remove the jacket, the cover is illustrated with the seal of the Knights Templar.<br /> This would make an excellent gift book for the idealistic and impressionable. As the book points out, the message of chivalry is somehow irresistible, an ever-receding horizon of hope that survives all the wars and other disasters that mankind has suffered through the centuries. It is a message of nobility of purpose, of respect and compassion for others, and of courage in the face of danger.r the idealistic and impressionable.

I say this in the sense that I wish Mein Kamph would have been more widely read. If people would have been more familiar with the author's ideas it would have averted horrible tragedy, and outright evil, in the world. As Ayn Rand is the author most quoted by \\"libertarians\\", \\"free-traders\\", and advocates of \\"hands off\\" capitalism this also applies.<br /> Her philosophy of Objectivism is the philosophy of sociopathy, of the ego freed from the restraints of social conscience. All that is important is gratification of the ego. There is no room for community, no room for humanity, no room for God- the individual ego is God. To the objectivist, \\"altruism\\", lending a hand or doing good for it's own sake, is a dirty word. I have heard a leading spokesman for Rand's philosophy denounce Hitler primariy because he was too \\"altruistic.\\" Make of that what you will. In our own time, the proponets of unrestrained corporate power, and of the dismantling of elected government, love Rand. They tell you that only governments can \\"initiate force.\\" This is the Big Lie- there is no moral difference between shooting a man and starving him to death through economic control of resources- or controlling people through the threat of it. Rand and her objectivists are usually very adept at formal argument and logic. However, their basic premises are so absolutely inhumane that their arguments are mere castles in the air. Castles empty of humanity and God, but filled with evil.<br /> I sometimes wonder what sort of childhood abuse in her native Russia could have warped Rand so seriously. It is obvious that her philosophy is an extreme over reaction to communist collectivism- in the same way that Satanism is an extreme overreaction to Christian fundamentalism	2004-06-17

I suspect that it shall be recognised as one of the single greatest products to come out of 20th century American letters.<br /> No, I'm not setting Campbell up as a prophet or anything like that, indeed, I suspect that this book's greatness lies in the eternal truths that transcend Campbell's individual personality. He just managed to tap into them- thank God.<br /> The entire work deals with the hero's journey. This is the Monomyth shared by all cultures- and indeed seems to be a direct inspiration from the cosmos itself by way of the collective unconscious. Here we have the eternal cycle of 1) the call to adventure; 2) the crossing of the threshold; 3) the tests, trials, and helpers; 4) the sacred marriage, apotheosis (becoming one with god), or elixir theft; 5)the flight 6) recrossing/ressurection; and 7) the return to society with hard won gifts. He examines all of these elements in depth with a wealth of cross-cultural examples. The first half of the book deals with this cycle on a more individual and personal level (the microcosm), while the second half deals with the greater cosmogonic importance (the macrocosm.)<br /> Now, the really amazing part of all this is that virtually all of it comes across as meaningful, interesting, and totally nonacademic. That's why many academic types hate Campbell, and his mentor Jung,- they know that Campbell's and Jung's works will endure and be read a thousand years from now, while their own monographs will be justly forgotten. There are a lot of mediocre Ph.D's out there that can never forget that Campbell never bothered to get a doctorate, because he considered such degrees to be a worthless and meaningless waste of time....	2004-06-17

If you think that this is just an adventure story with vampires, then you are missing the point. Sure, it works on that level, but intentionally or unintentionally, something much more sinister is going on.<br /> This book was written in 1954, a time when there was general paranoia about communists hiding under every rock. More importantly, there was also a growing fear of the youth subculture and &quot;juvenile delinquents.&quot; When the vampires in this story are described as &quot;pallid, glassy-eyed travesties of humanity&quot; the author is obviously talking about drugged-up kids- either then or now.<br />Combine this with the fact that the hero (the last true man on earth) is described as being middle aged, of English-German stock, college educated, and cultured. In short, he is an upper-class wasp surrounded by a society of vampires (i.e. blood sucking freaks who, in his opinion, contribute nothing to society.)<br />Having said this, I now have to say that this is exactly why people still identify with the main character. In fact, given the mass psychology involved with our current &quot;war on terror&quot; and &quot;war on drugs&quot; I am sure that this novel will enjoy renewed popularity for years to come. Paranoia still serves a political purpose.<br />Oh yes, this book was the basis of the film &quot;The Omega Man&quot;, but a much better version was made in Italy in 1964 called &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot;- it stared Vincent Price in one of his greatest roles.	2004-06-16

In fact, this will be my 77th. This Anything Book has a handsome, leatherette cover with a gilt border. It has a good feel about it and seems durable. The pages are lined- 24 lines per page with a 3/4&quot; margin in top for titles and numbers. The end papers are heavy but plain.<br />My only problem with it is that it is so thin. I know it says it has 160 pages, but even that isn't really adequate. For the serious journal keeper, you no more than get started and you are ready for another. For years the standard was around 190 pages- and I can remember when the average journal was well over 200 pages. Is this being done simply to sell more journals? Or is it possible that most people find it difficult to fill even a thin journal with original ideas and notable occurances and observations these days?<br />In any case, it seems a waste to put so few pages between so fine of covers.	2004-06-16

The AR-7 was a cheap semi-auto .22 survival rifle developed by Eugene Stoner back in the late 50's for the Air Force. The blow-back action was inheritantly prone to jamming. My own weapon would jam if you oiled it too much, oiled it too little- or just looked at it cross-eyed. In a survival situation I would MUCH rather have a reliable bolt action, or even single shot, than a semi-auto that is going to jam at least once with every clip of ammo.<br />As for it being an &quot;Exotic Weapons System&quot;, no matter what you do with it it will still be a .22LR plinker. Even if you alter it to selective fire as the book shows, all you have is a cheap zip gun- which by the way is highly illegal even if it was worth the effort. Dressing up a rifle with military accessories such as a skeleton stock, flash supressor, and pistol grip isn't going to make it more effective. It is like putting several thousand dollars of flashy junk on a Ford pick-up- in the end you've still got a Ford.<br />If you have a real need for an assault rifle, then get a real assault rifle- something dependable. If you need a survival gun then get something reliable (and a .410 is much more useful in filling the pot.) If you just want something cool to plink with then get one of the look-alike .22LR M-16 copies. but don't waste your time and money with this.	2004-06-16

I started reading this book with skepticism. I mean, how could anyone condense the core of Schopenhauers's life's work into a 90 minute (75 actually) read? I mean the _World as Will and Representation_ alone is a mammoth four volumes. And yet Strathern did it.... I don't know if he succeeded with the other volumes of this series, but by god, he did it with Schopenhauer- and managed to throw in all sorts of interesting, insightful tid-bits of his personal life (as well as placing it in the overall context of western philosophy.)<br />For those unfamiliar with Schopenhauer's core ideas they are just this: will is the cause of all things in the universe. Will is the thing-in-itself. There is blind will in \\"inanimate\\" matter and intelligent will in Man. In fact, in man is the will supreme. All nature is an expression of will- and man is a pattern of the universe, greatly reduced. Yet, will to be, will to create, is the cause of all evil and suffering and is therefore to be denied, if not extinguished. In this way, Schopenhauer always reminded me of a \\"cold-enlightened\\" Buddhist of the Theravadan school. However, Schopenhauer did hold that we would be reabsorbed into the great universal will at death- stripped of lesser animal consciousness.<br />By the way, it should be noted that this is all very different from Nietzsche's Will to Power- Nietzsche essentially turned Schopenhauer's idea of will on its head- and then went insane.<br />Oh, by the way, I do not agree with the author that Schopenhauer was a nasty piece of work. He was simply, totally, an original- this creates friction. He was also a completely confident authority that trusted his own intellect and intuition at all times- instead of diluting his ideas will appeals to authority and footnotes. He was also correct that Hegel was a fraud- and that Kant was pure genius.	2004-06-13

This thick little book was based on the Canadian documentary film series &quot;This Business of the Gods.&quot; It is every bit as powerful as the Moyer's series- indeed it is uncannyly simular in content.<br /> The book is divided into eight chapters: 1) Gods, 2)Symbols, 3) Goddesses, 4) Initiations, 5) Animals, 6) Underground, 7) Conflict, and 8) Freedom. In these eight chapters Campbell and Boa manage to cover the essential nature of human life and spirituality. He does this through the medium of myth- and comparative religion. As Campbell puts it, myth is social dream and dream is the individual myth.<br /> There are a few concepts here that more convention religious minds will find shocking, such as the absurdity of looking for the &quot;Holy Land&quot; in some remote part of the world, or that the core mystery of Christianity is to follow the example of Christ- and see through the symbol in order to transcend it.<br /> I've read through this little volume three times now. It is so compact that you can keep in your pocket for convenient moments and almost forget that it is there.<br />  I personally loved the analogy of most &quot;mature&quot; individuals in this society being like people who have spent all of their adult life climbimg to the top of a ladder- only to find that it was against the wrong wall....<br />by the way, 2004 is the 100th anniversary of Campbell's birth. He died on Oct. 30th (my birthday) in 1987.	2004-06-12

Even the cover makes it look like a leather-bound illuminated manuscript.<br />What if Kal-el had landed in England during the Dark Ages instead of America in the 20th century? That is the heart of this tale, as told by James son of Olls. It is the story of a child fallen from heaven and found by simple peasants- peasants that must hide his powers lest there be talk of witchcraft. Then one day, the young Kal would travel to Lexford, stronghold the the black Baron Luthor and his ward, the fair Lady Loisse. The result reads more like a Shakespearian tragedy than a comic book.<br />It all makes sense really, for who else could drive a sword through a stone with his dieing strength?	2004-06-10

Thomas Merton assembled it with admirable spiritual insight and sensitivity. Here is the path of the ancient sages. It is not a &quot;how to&quot; manual, for, &quot;He who knows does not speak, and he who speaks does not know.&quot; And yet, this book somehow indirectly gives you a sense of what it is to be centered in the Tao. You get a fleeting sense of what it is like to live a life of such centerness and simplicity that it is difficult to tell where your own consciousness ends and the currents of the cosmos begin. This is the state of Wu Wei, effortless action in complete resonance with the Tao.<br /> I suppose that what I found so refreshing during this rereading was the confirmation that men of wealth, station, and learning are not to be admired. They are the least enlightened of men. Indeed, the true man of Tao will live humble in simplicity and obscurity- and yet such beings are the true wellsprings of cosmic harmony between heaven and earth....	2004-06-10

All of the old familiar members are here: Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Atom, Martian Manhunter, as well as the \\"associate members\\" from Black Canary to Zatanna. Yet they all fit together perfectly- for this is primarily a tale of teamwork for the greater good. There is no squabbling and conflict of egos here. That is because these are all men and women whose only reason to BE is to help those who need their help. Each individual member has been gifted with powers and abilities that would enable them to easily overwhelm ordinary men and rule as kings or queens- yet none of them would consider such a thing for an instant. Individually and collectively the League stands for liberty and justice. They are altruism, and incorruptibility, incarnate. Their code is simple: Wherever lives are threatened, a champion will fight to save them. On land or sea the rules are simple, those who use force will find it returned in kind- and killing is never tolerated.<br />If the League has flaw, it lies in the fact that they are too powerful, too perfect. Lesser men hold them in suspicion. When a super-plague breaks out in Africa they are hard pressed to maintain their sacred trust in the face of global fury and desperation. And yet they do, for they know that their greatest power comes from the belief that the people have in them as allies and friends.<br />I have read all of the Paul Dini and Alex Ross collaborations. I won't say that this one is my favorite- what I will say is that they are all good.	2004-06-10

That's just it, the only thing really bigger than life is the great City that the novel is named for. It is a magnificent, colossal art-deco Metropolis that looks like the futuristic vision of all the great World's Fairs of the 1930's lumped together. There are monorails, zeppelins, flying wings- even streamlined robots and flying cars. But it is a sterile city- stagnant. There has been no new construction for years. It dwarfs and oppresses the spirit of its human inhabitants dwelling in the shadows. It makes them seem small and insignificant. Every character seems like a stock stereotype from the 30's. There is no originality here. Everything is frozen into dead forms. In the absence of vitality and optimism, the rule of the jungle reigns.<br /> Even the main character, Cosmo Quinn, doesn't come across as much of a hero. In true film noir style he is presented as an everyman (who just happens to be the most famous daredevil in the world) who is caught up in dark machinations out of his control. In fact, just about every daredevil, adventurer, and would be hero-symbol in the city has mysteriously died, disappeared, or been framed and smeared over the years. Most of the story deals with Quinn and his friends slowly (and I mean SLOWLY) uncovering the hidden corruption in the great city.<br /> The one great saving scene in the whole overlong epic is when the disgraced world-champion boxer Kid Gloves fights his way back to the top against a collection of subhuman apes and missing links- and finally a robot. Like John Henry he lives just long enough to triumph over the monsters and machines that symbolize the great social Darwinist hell- only to die of a burst heart at the moment of his greatest glory. Another cliche, but one that actually does manage to make the leap to the archetypical.<br />Of course there is also the strange case of the \\"sleep walkers\\" that defy the physical laws in their slumber- that is never really addressed. It is like they pop up now and then to remind us that there are mysteries that transcend a mechanical, oppressive, sterile existence...that defy the physical laws in their slumber- that is never really addressed.

After I flipped through it, I thought that it was an art book. After I sat down and read it, I knew that it was a holy book.<br />This is the vision of a 54-year-old businessman hooked up to life support after suffering a stroke at the office. He knows that he is dieing, he can look down at his body connected to the machines, but he doesn't care. He is ready to just fade away into limbo. The world no longer holds any attraction for him, for as he states, it was more likely vomited up by the devil, than created by any God. For our hero has never met a man who didn't have a lie on his lips- and pain in his heart. He had never seen a day pass when human suffering didn't scream at him from every corner of the world. It was all meaningless, all for nothing- and he just wanted to turn his back on the whole mess and go.<br />And then with the sight that only comes to the dieing and the dead he saw HER. As his vision slowly expanded to encompass the world he saw her in her multitude of forms. Wherever there were those that were desperate, hopeless, helpless- She was there. Wherever demons and ghosts threatened the sanity and faith of the living, She was there.  As his vision began to roam time itself he saw her descend into the corrupt matrix of matter, of flesh. She was the transcendent principle emanated from the hub of the wheel of eternity- that mankind might never be alone. She was the connection by which the heart might be reunited with what lay beyond that hub. She was known by many names in many lands, but the name that came to his mind was- Mercy.	2004-06-08

Huanchu Daoren was reputed to have been a layman past the age of 60- the time of retirement from public affairs and the closing season of life. Yet one gets the sense that he had been preparing himself for this detachment, practicing it as best he could, for all of his life. As he puts it, retire when you are at the height of your career- and count yourself as a survivor. For this is a book on how to live the most simple, pure, and genuine life even when surrounded by power, wealth, and chaos. It shows how to move among the powerful, the vicious, and the ignorant without losing your center. It even points the Way towards clearing your mind in order to find this center. Once found, the sage is imperturbable. Indeed, the sage is the nucleus around which harmony and natural order coalesce in the human realm.<br />There is an incredible wealth of concentrated wisdom here, verified and filtered by the ages:<br />When the rich and well established, who should be generous, are instead spiteful and cruel, they make their behavior wretched and base in spite of their wealth and position. When the intellectually brilliant, who should be reserved, instead show off, they are ignorant and foolish in their weakness in spite of their brilliance.<br />&quot;Always leave some food for the mice; pity the moths and don't light the lamp.&quot; Thoughts like these that the ancients had are the living, life-giving mechanism of us humans. Without this, we are no more than statues or manikins.<br />When enlightened people are so poor that they cannot help others, if they speak a word to awaken the confused or to resolve a problem, there is also boundless merit in that.	2004-06-07

It isn't that I find it that hard to understand, it is just that it is so dense with meaning that I feel compelled to glean it over and over to see if I missed anything.<br /> The basic premise of the book is that a transcedent God (or Vast Acive Living Intelligence System) not only exists, but periodically \\"breaks through\\" into our own material world \\"the Black Iron Prison.\\" If we are receptive, or desperate enough, it makes itself known (i.e. grants \\"gnosis\\"- the knowlege of the true state of things.) I consider Dick to be an expert on Gnosis, afterall, it actually happened to him. You see this story is semi-autobiographical. Considering the hell that the protagonist, Horselover Fat, goes through in his interactions with a totally incompetent mental health bureaucracy, and a completely dysfunctional social and family life, you hope that it isn't too close to his actual life. Still, it was no doubt this living hell (coupled with his drug abuse) that led to his epiphany. This is somewhat like true shamanic inititiation- the ordeal either kills you, or you break through the veil of this prison world into the \\"real\\" world beyond.<br />Actually, it is the ideas imbedded in this novel that are it's true worth. These are best expressed in _The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick: Selected Literary and Philosophical Writings_. In fact, the included essay \\"Cosmogony and Cosmology\\" is from this collection.<br />One other thing, if you watch the film _The Matrix_ and then read this book, you get the inexcapable feeling that the \\"world behind the world\\" plot line is straight out of P.K.D....	2004-06-06

Rather, Madam Blavatsky's knowlege and intellect humbles me. Take just about any &quot;newly rediscovered&quot; esoteric topic of any worth and you will most probably find it explained in considerable detail in either this work or _Isis Unveiled_. I am dismayed that so few people, or biliographies, give credit to Madam Blavatsky, or to the Theosophical Society that she founded. I guess we are just too &quot;quaint&quot; and &quot;old-fashion&quot; for the &quot;New Age.&quot;<br /> There is just too much encyclopedic knowlege here to simply read through from scratch. You need to work up to it. Try a introductory text like _Ocean of Theosophy_ by William Q. Judge. However, do not be afraid to pick up either volume and simply &quot;browse.&quot; I still do this after all these years- and I am still surprised and amazed at what I find.<br /> One further thing, there has been a considerable amount of character assassination against Madam Blavatsky in the last few years. The authors that have penned these attacks have no understanding of the matters that they address. First of all, no one was a stronger critic of seances than Madam Blavatsky. Secondly, the Society has always held that one should never charge money for spiritual matters. As for the ad hominem attacks that she was grossly obese, well, this is the lowest form of slander and doesn't deserve comment. Simply take a look at any of the surviving photographs to see the truth.<br /> Concerning attacks on Theosophical concepts such as the &quot;seven races&quot; and &quot;seven globes&quot;, just keep in mind that the perenial philosophy holds that the highest part of what makes up a person pre-exists on a higher plane- and will return there after we cross over. Just remember the old gnostic concept of &quot;seven heavens.&quot; Literalism is a mistake in theosophy, just as it has proven in fundamentalist Christianity.	2004-06-05

But then, that is also covered in this story, Siddhartha's father could not protect him from the world, nor could Siddhartha protect his own son when the time came. You've got to go forth and learn these lessons yourself. It is the same archetypical patterns, with variations, over and over.<br /> I remember that when I first read this story it confused me that the Buddha and Siddhartha were two separate persons. Then I came to realise the truth of archetypes, and immortal paterns that resonate in many different bodies at the same time- all seemingly separate, but all really sharing the same great life. All ultimately flowing together to form the great river of life.	2004-06-05

I have always suspected that this penultimate novel of Hesse's plays upon the myth of the Most Honorable Order of the Rosy Cross in certain German intellectual circles. Even today you can get an arguement, either way, about the existance of the Rosicrucians and Christian Rosencreutz. This is fitting, since even the protagonist (H.H.) is left wondering if the League that sent him forth on his quest really ever existed or if he hallucinated it all.<br /> At the begining H.H. has no doubt what-so-ever in the existance or purpose of the ancient League. He sets forth on the journey to the East with his brother members in pursuit of the Tao, Kundalini, and the other Eastern mysteries. In short, they are seeking union with the divine. Even when some member drops out during the quest and &quot;takes the railroad back&quot; to the mundane world, they simply bid him farewell and continue on, unshaken in their own faith. They travel on through time, myth, poetry, and magic towards their goal.<br /> It is at the gorge of Morbio Inferiore that everthing unravels. It is here that the loyal servant Leo suddenly departs and the expedition falls apart in squabbling over trifles. Morbio Inferiore is the dark night of the soul. It is also the historical cataclysm of WW1. You see, before the Great War Germans could still belive in magic, Mozart, and Goethe, after the war all magic and innocence were dead. All that remained was cynicism, machines, and monsters.<br /> H.H. is suddenly left alone wondering if the League ever really existed or if it was a dream. He searches and searches for the lost servant Leo- only to be surprised at what he eventually finds....<br /> Ultimately we end up at the realization that despair serves a purpose in our own journey through life. For if we are still capable of despair then we must still, deep down, still believe in innocence, virtue, and justice. You cannot deeply mourn what never existed- somewhere, sometime!	2004-06-05

This book requires a reader with not only a first rate mind, but also a balanced one.<br /> To briefly abstract the primary thesis: time is really motion in extra dimensional space. This is profound, for Ospensky was the first to actually point towards where an actual, physical fourth dimension can be found. Our brains confuse this dimension with time. It can be split off from time with an adjustment, or evolution, of consciousness. You see, this represents the next huge leap in understanding the nature of the universe and reality. Just as Newton's undefined quantity of &quot;gravity&quot; was shown to actually be curved space, so does Ouspensky show Einstein's undefined quantity of &quot;time&quot; to be motion through higher physical dimensions.<br /> If you want a book that will challenge you, this is it. One day these ideas are going to shake the very foundations of mainstream science, of mankind's collective view of &quot;reality&quot;....	2004-06-05

I also remember the summer that I read the entire trilogy, it was the first time that I was completely immersed in a satisfying, intelligent, alternate reality.<br />Epic, is the only way to describe this opus. Starting in a Galactic Empire that is starting to slip into decline, then on to the monastic settlement of the Foundation and it's mission to preserve the best of the old civilization, then on to the recivilization of the ruins of the old Empire. If I recall correctly, it takes around 1000 years, but without the foundation it would have meant 10 times more chaos and darkness. It is the sense of mission and purpose that holds the whole thing together. And if you like mysteries and surprises, there is the matter of the Second Foundation....<br />Asimov wrote this when he was fairly young. He still had an unshakable faith that science could accomplish anything. Indeed, he saw a traditional clockwork universe that a sufficiently great mind, like Hari Seldon, could mathematically unlock. Later on in his writing Asimov matured- until he saw the galaxy itself as a living, evolving organism- a grand Gaia hypothesis.<br />One other thing, having grown up in New York, I think young Asimov saw himself as Hari Seldon in seeing a decadent and declining civilisation before anyone else.

The term &quot;warrior&quot; is thrown about pretty loosely these days. Not all soldiers are warriors. A modern soldier is a technician trained to obey orders and complete his mission at all costs. He is conditioned to see no humanity in the enemy. A soldier is taught to value pride and glory. A warrior, in contrast, obeys an inner code of conduct above all orders. A warrior sees the common humanity in all mankind- especially in an opponent. A warrior has renounced ego, so pride and glory are irrelevent.<br /> This gem of a book gives the road map of the warrior's path. It is a path that you will probably only recognise if you have already traveled on it. It is more of a confirmation of lessons hard won in the battle of life. No book will magically show you the sacredness, the fundamental goodness, of the cosmos. Only experience, and deep meditation on that experience will do that. To be a warrior is to achieve synchronisation with all that is. Once you have reached this state you are incapable of acting with dishonor. To do so would be contrary to Nature. Moreover, once you have achieved this synchronization of body, mind, and cosmos your will and nature seem to be One. This is when &quot;magic&quot; happens.<br /> So what is a warrior? A warrior is a person without ego, a person without fear, a person who is one with all of creation- and who acts accordingly to redeem the world about him.<br />What is an example of such a person in today's world? Those Tibetan fighters who resisted the Chinese so well and so long were Warriors. Then the Dalai Lama told them to lay down their weapons and fight no more. These warriors would not disobey their true monarch. Nor could they submit to dehumanising rule by communist invaders. To do so would have destroyed their honor. So they voluntarily gave up their lives on their beloved mountains with their weapons by their sides. They did not disobey, nor did they submit to slavery. For eternity shall their names resound in the halls of Shambhala....f Shambhala....	2004-06-05

When time came for me to drastically weed out my library, this was the only book on the subject that I kept. It is a scholarly treatment, but not a mathematical one.<br /> The chapter structure is as follows: 1. Introduction to Geomorphology, 2. Weathering and Mass Wasting, 3. Stream Growth and Valley Development, 4. The Development of Stream Eroded Landscapes, 5. Geomorphic Systems- Theory and Philosophy, 6. Glaciers and Glaciated Landscapes, 7. Wind, Waves, Ground Water, and Volcanism.<br /> All subjects are excellently illustrated by full page portions of actual topographic maps, as well as, crisp cross-sections and diagrams.<br /> This one volume seems to cover just about all the basics of the field. Anything in more depth would probably have to be more of a mathematical/engineering approach. As it is, this slim volume gives a comprehensive appreciation of the structures and processes that form our dynamic, intelligent, planet.<br /> Indeed, not only will you understand the processes that mold the landscape anywhere on earth, but these same principles have been shown to be applicable in the field of planetary geology.	2004-06-05

Rather, Madam Blavatsky's knowlege and intellect humbles me. Take just about any &quot;newly rediscovered&quot; esoteric topic of any worth and you will most probably find it explained in considerable detail in either this work or _Isis Unveiled_. I am dismayed that so few people, or biliographies, give credit to Madam Blavatsky, or to the Theosophical Society that she founded. I guess we are just too &quot;quaint&quot; and &quot;old-fashion&quot; for the &quot;New Age.&quot;<br /> There is just too much encyclopedic knowlege here to simply read through from scratch. You need to work up to it. Try a introductory text like _Ocean of Theosophy_ by William Q. Judge. However, do not be afraid to pick up either volume and simply &quot;browse.&quot; I still do this after all these years- and I am still surprised and amazed at what I find.<br /> One further thing, there has been a considerable amount of character assassination against Madam Blavatsky in the last few years. The authors that have penned these attacks have no understanding of the matters that they address. First of all, no one was a stronger critic of seances than Madam Blavatsky. Secondly, the Society has always held that one should never charge money for spiritual matters. As for the ad hominem attacks that she was grossly obese, well, this is the lowest form of slander and doesn't deserve comment. Simply take a look at any of the surviving photographs to see the truth.<br /> Concerning attacks on Theosophical concepts such as the &quot;seven races&quot; and &quot;seven globes&quot;, just keep in mind that the perenial philosophy holds that the highest part of what makes up a person pre-exists on a higher plane- and will return there after we cross over. Just remember the old gnostic concept of &quot;seven heavens.&quot; Literalism is a mistake in theosophy, just as it has proven in fundamentalist Christianity.	2004-06-05

When it was penned in 1894 this book was unique. This is because prior to that time all books on the subject were traditionlly written in an obscure and metaphorical manner. Bishop Leadbeater changed all that- he took 19th century scientific objectivism and applied it to the most mystical and subjective of studies. The result is a virtual Baedecker (travel book) of the astral realms. As a result this was the first modern English language text to be included in the permanent collection of the Brotherhood. This book opened, and continues to open, doors.<br />Briefly, this little volume, covers: scenary, inhabitants, and phenomena of the astral realm. Since this is the realm most closely in contact with our own it can be a most useful and practical guide book. For instance, you will find summarised here more real facts on black magicians, elementals, shades, vampires, and werewolves than in many thicker, more modern volumes.

I've also heard it dismissed as a &quot;kid's book.&quot; A &quot;kid's book&quot; would not have stuck in my memory for four decades now and provided me with inspiration and a model when I most needed it. A &quot;kid's book&quot; wouldn't have inspired me to stick out high school and college physics and mathematics instead of just throwing in the towel. It was remembering the example of this book, and _Starman Jones_, that got me through Calculus. I just wish the rest of the world would have lived up to the high ideals expressed in these books....<br /> I recently reread this tale after many years. I was amazed at how &quot;nondated&quot; it was. Heinlein has a perfect description of cell phones and cell towers. Something else finally hit me too- this is where Gene Roddenbury got most of his ideas for Star Trek. Heinlein actuallly uses the term &quot;the Federation.&quot; His Interplanetary Patrol is obviously the inspiration for Star Fleet with it's noble ideals, multi-cultural make-up (in 1948), it's commitment to keeping the peace, and it's 100 year record of keeping the peace (a phrase right out of Trek.) The importance of the Academy and its naval style of organization came from Heinlein, the Annapolis graduate. The way that the organization is entirely composed of officers and officers in training- that's also pure Star Trek. Heinlein wrote of all this almost 20 years before Trek aired....	2004-06-03

Nicholas Urfe is a typical, modern, young man. He believes in nothing- not family, not country, not duty, not God, not love. He is an egoist that imagines himself an existentialist. In the isolation of Phraxos he is forced to examine this &quot;self&quot; that is all he believes in for the first time. He finds that there is little or nothing there. This realization pushes him to the abyss. Yet he doesn't even have the strength of will to pull the trigger. This is the final blow to his world, his ego.<br />Enter the magus. This is in accordance with the ancient formula, &quot;When the student is ready, the teacher will come.&quot; Nicholas is now fertile ground with all of his preconceptions about himself and his world broken assunder. The magus now proceeds to introduce Nicholas to the Mysteries. Indeed, the greatest lesson that is taught is that the universe is more mysterious, more timeless, more boundless, more terrible and awe-full than the modern materialist mind can grasp.<br />A clue comes in the early conversation about the novel being &quot;dead as alchemy.&quot; This is irony, you see, not only is Conchis a master alchemist when it comes to the transmutation of souls, but all great novels, including this one, are also powerful works of alchemy.<br />This entry refers to the Spanish language translation of the novel.	2004-06-03

This is one of the few books that I read as a boy that stuck with me all the rest of my life. While I never studied to be an \\"astrogator\\", this book did inspire me to study astronomy, navigation, physics, and calculus. It gave me a dream to build on. You see, the hero, Max, is a poor, rural kid from a highly dysfunctional and abusive family (actually, white trash is more accurate.) Being lower class, Max has no realistic chance of going to college or entering a profession ( a \\"guild\\".) Yet Max not only escapes, he goes on to Captain a starship.

Perhaps it is best that I found it now and not earlier, for it is the supreme example of speculative thinking about the future in my experience. I can't think of another book in the science fiction genre that I could compare it to, for nothing else comes close.<br /> This is the story of a man who takes an evening walk out upon the hills behind his home, only to be seized and swept away by a cosmic vision that seems to span the aeons. At first, he seems to be a single, disembodied point of consciousness with the ability to move at will among the stars. Then, he is drawn to a world of man-like creatures where he comes to enter into telepathic union with one of the natives. He and his host come to explore the entire history of this world before shoving off, together, to explore the other inhabited worlds of the galaxy. They are joined, one by one, by other simular explorers as they come to wander an incredible diversity of inhabited worlds. Slowly, they come to see the larger story of the galaxy, and then the entire cosmos. They see world after world unite into various forms of utopian &quot;world minds.&quot; Then they see these world minds reach across the galaxy to colonise other worlds, and to make contact with other intelligent species. Finally, after aeons of conflict and struggle, all the galaxy is united into one great telepathically linked Galactic Union. Yet even this is but the beginning, for the next step is to make contact with the other galaxies- and with the stars and nebula themselves (for it turns out that the great cosmic bodies of the universe are themselves intelligent.) And when this is accomplished, all three great living super species press on into the higher dimensions of existance to make contact with the Creator himself- the Star Maker....<br /> I understand that Stapledon spent part of his youth in Egypt, that would partially explain the ease at which he spans great extents of time, as well as, the rise and fall of great civilizations. Of course, he was also educated at Oxford, which would explain the simularities to Neoplatonism. At any rate, like the narrator, it is hard to believe that Stapledon didn't experience a vision of Cosmic Consciousness himself to inspire such a magnificently complex and profound work.<br /> Oh yes, this book is not written like a conventional novel. In fact, there is not a line of conventional dialog in it. It is instead, an extremely concentrated journal of idea after significant idea. As for the ideas, not only does the science hold up remarkably well for a book written in 1937, but if you read closely you find hints of the big bang, the holographic universe, morphogenic fields, the multiverse, cybernetic reality, etc., etc., etc. It reads rather like the journal of a classically educated Englishman of before the war.

Not only did it describe experiences that I thought were unique to myself, but I found that there was actually a name for such things- shamanism. I had never even heard the name before. Yet, I knew exactly what was being described.<br /><br /> That's just it, though, this book's importance to me was in its validation of the path that I had already traveled- alone. When I see people claiming that they are shamans, or &quot;neo-shamans&quot;, based on reading a few books or attending a workshop or two, I can only shake my head. I mean, I see nothing wrong with such things, no more than I see anything wrong with dabblers in Wicca, it is just that I don't personally believe that it is shamanism. I don't say this out of arrogance, self-righteousness, or a sense of superiority- it is just that I have found that the transition involved in crossing over to the spirit world is absolutely life shattering and soul transforming. There is a good chance that it may kill you. Actually, in a sense, it does kill you, for to be a shaman means to die and be reborn. It is not the sort of thing that a bored yuppy can do on a weekend to demonstrate his &quot;spiritual sensitivity.&quot;<br />Personally, I think shamans are either born, or they result from a certain type of near death experience. As much as I respect Native American medicine people, I do not think that they have any sort of inside track or &quot;secret knowlege.&quot; Their advantage lies in being outside of the artificial hell of the modern world- and perhaps in having more of an &quot;opportunity&quot; to hit bottom and reflect on it.

If you were born under a flag with less than 50 stars, then this book will speak to you. While it is set in 1920's Illinois, this book resonates perhaps 50 years into the future, and into the past. Alas, I fear that it may resonate very faintly in these &quot;post-modern&quot; times. Still, if your life is rooted in that Golden-Age of small-town, heartland America, you will recognise these scenes, these characters, these feelings. Bradbury is a writer, a poet actually, of the heart and of feelings. Indeed, before I read him I didn't have the understanding or the patience to read poetry. Afterwards I did.

Simak, and then I found this one. A faulty reference lists this as an alternate title to one of his other novels. It is not, this is a totally original work. It is also the work where he perhaps gives human society, and human existence, his most profound examination.<br /> Imagine a world where cryonics, the preservation of the human body by freezing, has become not only the norm, but also the primary reason for human existence. Imagine that one single corporation is in charge of freezing and preserving every single person in the world, until either a cure for their disease- or outright immortality- is discovered. Imagine that people work their entire lives to scrape together the money that the corporation demands for the trust fund to look after their bodies after death. Imagine that some people choose \\"early death\\" so that they can be frozen before they eat into their trust fund. Now, imagine that this is all one giant scam- that no one has ever been revived and no one ever will be. Finally, imagine that you have unwittingly stumbled over this fact- and the corporation knows that you know!<br /> Simak does no less than examine the fundamental obsession of western society with the cult of materialism, science, and progress. The belief in eventual immortality and \\"paradise\\" through freezing is analogous to the average westerner's unshakable belief in physical science. In Simak's tale the vast majority of mankind have abandoned any belief in God or an afterlife because with scientifically induced immortality they feel that they don't need it any more. That is except for a few mavericks and rebels on the fringe of the corporate mega-state- and the system does everything it can to either round up or eliminate them.<br /> A frightening look at what Simak saw coming- a world totally run and ruled by the Corporation.- a world where God and heaven have been eliminated because they stood in the way of increased corporate profits.ed because they stood in the way of increased corporate profits.	2004-06-03

Of course the same goes for the idea of robots carrying out man's dream of exploring the universe, as a sacred trust, long after men have ceased to be. There is also the supreme sacrifice of man to ensure that his old companions will develop to their full potential, without human interference.<br />As much as I love Simak's _Waystation_ and _The Goblin Reservation_, this book is probably his masterpiece. It is certainly his most epic, covering so many millenia. Here are themes that he would expand in such works as _Ring Around the Sun_, _A Choice of Gods_, and _Special Deliverence_.

It has rightfully been called THE sourcebook of western magic (or at least of the Renaissance rediscovery of the Art.). It is recorded that the magus Dr. John Dee always kept a copy open on his desk at Mortlake for ready reference. Even today many of us keep Agrippa's masterpiece out and ready- some for reference, others to merely impress.<br /><br />The basic, uniting principle of this mammoth volume is the Soul of the World. This is the traditional Greek concept (Agrippa was clearly a Neo-Platonist) of an intermediary world-soul that mediates between the One and the material world. This is the basis of all natural magic. This is what interconnects all of Agrippa's vast system of astrology, numerology, alchemy, Kabala, seals, talismans, lists of correspondences, etc. Everything in the cosmos emanates downward from the highest Source. Moreover, hidden currents and vibrations interconnect the lower with the higher in sympathetic union.<br />As much as I value this classic book, if I wanted a single volume for practical use and reference I would probably choose _The Magician's Companion_ by Bill Whitcomb.  However, I would still keep this book in my master collection with the rest of the great source works.<br />Contrary to rumor, there was no fourth book written by Agrippa- the one in circulation is a very old forgery.	2004-05-30

Just in English translation I can see where these teachings transport you to an entirely different sort of mind-set, an entirely different world.<br />Indeed, you will either come to develop a sort of intuitive understanding of the spiritual principles being discused here, or you will simple give up in disgust and dismiss it as meaningless and incomprehensible. Perhaps it is incomprehensible to modern sensibility, but it is far from meaningless. If you are familiar with Plato and Plotinus it will help. I also find that a familiarity with the concept of the Tao helps with understanding what is meant by Kosmos. I suppose that there could be esoteric teachings encoded and hidden in the original text, but personally I find the exoteric spiritual and metaphysical speculations to be quite interesting and valuable in their own right.<br />There was a reason that these teachings were preserved through so many centuries, while so much else was consigned to flames or left to rot....	2004-05-30

While it isn't up-to-date by today's standards (you won't find gadgets like global positioning systems and night vision goggles) it will still give you an idea of how things are done &quot;old school.&quot;<br />The book is divided into seven main sections: 1.The Wilderness (path finding, travel by land, travel by water, travel in winter, provisioning in the field, living in the field), 2.The Sea (diving, offshore sailing), 3.Air (hang gliding, ballooning, parachuting), 4.Emergency (first aid and medicine, survival), 5.Vagabonding (bike touring, vagabonding- i.e. world traveling), 6.Exploring (exploring, treasure hunting, caving), and 7.Miscellaneous (photography.) Between the well-organized table of contents and full index you can find everything quickly.<br />For each topic you get a good general text description, a listing of further sources for detailed information, and section of specific equipment from various manufacturers giving specs., price range, and helpful hints. You've got everything here from pitons to very pistols.	2004-05-29

As the author points out, the majority of people are not metaphysicians or pneumatics. In fact, if you do not accept the basic epistemological premise that there are archetypical truths that are intuitively accessible to the Gnostic, then most of the book will make no sense to you. You must accept the existence of pure Intellect and the faculty of the immanent Spirit.<br /> This volume is perhaps the best summation of Schuon's thought- and of the Sophia Perennis. It deals with the underlying nature of creation- from the Absolute to the Infinite, from Transcendence to Immanence. The inner esoteric core of religion is examined from the perspective of both the traditions of &quot;God become man&quot; (Christianity, Ramaism, Krishnaism, and Amidism) and &quot;God as such&quot; (Abrahamism, Mosaism, Islam, Platonism, and Vedantism.) Yet, it is made very clear that this isn't mere &quot;comparative religion.&quot;<br /> Schuon states that the artist brings the Divine into the world, the mystic reintegrates the world- his soul- into the Divine. In this volume the author shows that he is both artist and mystic, as well as, Philosopher in the highest sense of those terms.<br /> This book reminded me of Guenon's _Symbolism of the Cross_ and _The Multiple States of Being_. Indeed, it was also originally published as two separate works. The current volume is divided into three parts: The World of Principles, The World of Tradition, and The World of the Soul.<br />There is one danger to reading such a book- it awakens you to just how trivial almost everything else you've ever read really is....	2004-05-20

Perhaps this is because it is an explanation, or rather introduction, to the totality of Creation- manifest, unmanifest, higher, lower, and probable.<br /> Here are described the manifest worlds of the material plane (the least part of creation), the higher planes of more subtle states (touched upon in _The Symbolism of the Cross_ as lying along the vertical axis), and all the possible, but unmanifested worlds on any plane (which sounds remarkably like the modern conception of the &quot;multiverse.&quot;)<br /> Yet, it is pointed out that all of this still falls far short of true infinity- it is a small included subset of the unlimited Source.<br /><br /> The human intersection with creation is also covered. This includes hints of &quot;non-corporeal modalities&quot; of human existence and consciousness. This covers simultaneously existing aspects of human consciousness on higher planes, that ordinary waking consciousness is ordinarily unaware of (yet, which comprise the greater part of consciousness.) Above all, it is emphasized that the human state is in reality only one small state of manifestation among countless others. There are an unlimited number of levels in the hierarchy of degrees of existence. Moreover, the human state occupies no privileged place in the ensemble of universal existence- the human state is in no way &quot;metaphysically distinguished&quot; in relation to other states. It just happens to be the state where most of us find ourselves at the present. That is all it is. If there is anything &quot;special&quot; about the human state, it lies in that spark of the Divine that lies at the heart of all of us, where the divine ray intersects with gross matter. And this intersection can occur at any point on the vertical axis of creation. It is also suggested that nonhuman, never human, entities share this creation with us.<br /><br /> All of this is not just idle &quot;New Age&quot; speculation; these are the conclusions of Guenon, the great metaphysician and mathematician.e &quot;New Age&quot; speculation; these are the conclusions of Guenon, the great metaphysician and mathematician.	2004-05-20

After the Great War that ended the first Atomic Age the Priesthood rebuilt the world. But the priests of the Hierarchy weren't really priests, at least not in the old timeless sense. In fact, the first thing a young initiate was taught was that the Great God did not exist- it was just a false idol and technological trick used to control the commoners. For the priests were really composed of all the privileged classes of the old age- the scientists, engineers, managers, doctors, and psychologists. They had banded together to rule the world by fear and superstition. They used the technology that they controlled to force and frighten the common people into serfdom and slavery. Indeed, they had used the Dark Ages as their inspiration and pattern in social organization, costumes, architecture- they even allowed witches to exist and operate as a means to help terrorize the masses. Unfortunately for the priests of the Hierarchy, the Witchcraft was far more than it seemed....<br />It is absolutely incredible that this tight little novel was written in 1943. Just the use of the term &quot;Atomic Age&quot; two years before Hiroshima is remarkable. Then combine that with the fact that Leiber accurately describes atomic power, genetic engineering, cloning, holograms, scientific brainwashing, psychological warfare, and mutually impenetrable force beams that sound exactly like light sabers. This novel was far ahead of its time and holds up as a gripping read even today. In fact, the oppressive elitism that it describes is more plausible today than it would have been in the freer decade of the 40's.	2004-05-08

In fact, the whole time that I was reading this collection I kept asking myself how one writer could have come up with so many original, fresh ideas. Not only that, but the ideas are just so well fleshed out with humor, intelligence, and scholarship.<br />The overall theme of the book is alternate timelines and realities. In fact, Rudy Rucker, the mathematician famed for his popular explorations of alternate dimensions and universes, is co-author of one of the component tales. I just couldn't get over the plausibility, or in the case of my favorite story \\"Campbell's World\\", the desirability of some of these alternate realities. Indeed, if you are like me you will be amazed that so many of your favorite writers and literary figures have been woven into them with such intricate knowledge and believability.<br />First of all, the introduction is written from the perspective of a world where science fiction totally died out in the mid-60's. It really gets you to thinking what today's world might be like without the genre- or the imagination and belief in the future that fuels it.<br />The first tale explores a world where Franz Kafka escaped his existential despair by becoming a costumed crime-fighter in 1920's Manhattan.<br />The second deals with a world where Anne Frank escaped occupied Europe to replace Judy Garland in Hollywood after the latter's early and tragic death.<br />The third chronicles Antoine Saint-Exupery's (the Little Prince) desperate flight from a plague depopulated northern hemisphere to bring H.G. Well's vision of Wings Over the World to actual life in colonial Kenya.<br />The fourth demonstrates the natural outcome of a world where Robert Heinlein succeeds FDR as our first post-war president.<br />The fifth, my favorite, is a deeply thoughtful and moving tale of a world where the shaman Joseph Campbell decided not to teach at Sarah Lawrence, but went on to run \\"Astounding Stories\\" instead.<br />The sixth, written with Rudy Rucker, deals with a world where Burroughs, Kerouac, and Cassidy detect a profound imbalance in the dimensions and unite to rid the world of the H-Bomb and the monsters responsible for it.<br />The seventh tells of a time traveler from a future where WWIII is fought with nuclear weapons - who exterminates Einstein only to see WWIII fought out with conventional weapons instead.<br />The eight story tells of a hell-world where Rush Limbaugh is absolute dictator of the U.S. and Phillip K. Dick must cross over into an alternate reality to set things right.<br />Finally, the ninth tale envisions Theodore Sturgeon as the head of an alien-worshipping cult in San Francisco- where aliens have become an all too real reality.<br />I literally couldn't put this book down, and I haven't been able to get that worked up over a work of fiction in a long time.unding Stories\\" instead.<br />The sixth, written with Rudy Rucker, deals with a world where Burroughs, Kerouac, and Cassidy detect a profound imbalance in the dimensions and unite to rid the world of the H-Bomb and the monsters responsible for it.<br />The seventh tells of a time traveler from a future where WWIII is fought with nuclear weapons - who exterminates Einstein only to see WWIII fought out with conventional weapons instead.<br />The eight story tells of a hell-world where Rush Limbaugh is absolute dictator of the U.S. and Phillip K.

Indeed, the first half largely recounts the workings of EREVNA and its teachings. For those who are unfamiliar with the organization, EREVNA is a essentially an organization founded on Cyprus that seeks to realize and internalize the teachings of the perennial Philosophy (but through somewhat of a Hellenic/Christian filter.) The first half also has some good original sections, such as an in depth discussion of corrupt and immoral spiritual teachers, as well as, an examination of \\"fundamentalist materialism\\" as expressed in such organizations as the \\"Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.\\" Indeed, Markides shows much more fairness and balance in his discussion than such \\"Skeptical Inquirers.\\"<br />It is the second half of the book that really gets into an examination of the mystical tradition within the Eastern Orthodox Church. He views organizations such as EREVNA as representing the equivalent of the Hindu tradition of jnana yoga (the wisdom path to Spirit) while Orthodox Spirituality is more analogous to bhaki yoga (the devotional or ecstatic path.) To Erevra's credit its members hold that any mystical practice that leads to Christ consciousness is authentic religion, whether it be Mahayana Buddhism, Sufism, Vedanta, or Christianity. The Orthodox view is not always so charitable. In fact, much of mainstream Orthodoxy seems to be unfamiliar with its own roots having adopted the arid, rationalistic theology of Western pattern in an attempt to \\"modernize.\\" In any case, the author actually travels to Mount Athos (Agion Oros) to meet and talk with more traditional practioners. He also discovers and briefly discusses the classical spiritual writings known as the Philokalia.<br />The closing section \\"Lifting the Veil\\" is especially good. It deals with the breakthrough of human consciousness in our times, and how we are finally evolving to a point where a significant number of individuals are learning to see beyond the primitive superstition of materialism. He points out that Kenneth Ring calls this the \\"shamanisation\\" of society.<br />This is third time that I've found myself reading this book. If you are primarily interested in the core of the perennial philosophy or tradition I also personally recommend The Only Tradition by Quinn, or Survey of Metaphysics and Esoterism by Schuon.evolving to a point where a significant number of individuals are learning to see beyond the primitive superstition of materialism.

It is inaccurate and an injustice. It is a strange sort of fanatic that hates the inquisition and the witch hunters, as much as, he does necromancers and murderers. Kane is in the ancient British and Irish tradition of a man who goes forth to wander the world after he receives the call- guided solely by his deep inner trust in his God. That is why he can walk the dark and wild places of the earth unscathed. That is why monsters and devils hold no terror for him. He simply trusts in the Lord to guide him to where he can do the most good. Kane is a Puritan in the original sense of the word, a single individual that has no tolerance for corruption whether it exists in the World- or the Church. He doesn't preach, for he doesn't need to- his actions, and his sword, speak for him. He needs no priest to mediate between himself and his Creator. Kane has gone beyond faith, for his is the sure and implacable knowledge that God exists. This is what makes him such a dangerous foe- you can't scare him and you can't make a deal with him. He obeys only the inner voice that guides him. I can see why the weak and corrupt would paint such a man as a fanatic.<br />Solomon Kane was Howard's first creation. In my opinion, he was also his best. There is an element present here that is missing from the later characters- something higher.<br />This particular collection includes the first of the Kane stories:<br /> Skulls in the Stars,<br /> The Right Hand of Doom,<br /> Red Shadows,<br /> Rattle of Bones,<br /> The Castle of the Devil,<br /> The Moon of Skulls,<br /> The One Black Stain,<br /> and The Blades of the Brotherhood.<br />The rest of the tales were published by Bantam Books in _Solomon Kane: The Hills of the Dead_.	2004-04-20

He had been asked to search the planes for the one twin soul to Crown Prince Kaskar- then cause both souls to unite in one body and destroy themselves on an alternate world. He knew that this was an evil act. He knew that both he and those of the old nobility that came to him with this plan would have to answer for it at the end of their days when they faced the Final Gate. Yet Prince Kaskar was a weak and corrupt man who was under the control of dark forces. Kaskar's grandfather had forged Ulad into a bastion of Justice, Peace, and Order in a world of chaos and violence. His father had maintained the realm against this Darkness. Kaskar, however, was of the third generation and lacking in courage, strength, and will. He was a weak soul that had easily become a puppet of hidden Evil- it was the soul of a weakling. Hence, Osythes sought to banish this weak, corrupt soul to an alternate world before the old king died and this abomination could take the thrown. He resigned himself to doing a smaller evil to prevent a far larger Age of Evil.<br />However, when the Chief Shaman found the twin soul that he had been looking for (by searching the worlds in dream trance) it was not at all what he expected. This soul connected to Kaskar belonged to Ramsay Kimble- of the blood of the Iroquois nation. This was not the soul of a coward, but of a hero. Not only that, but Ramsay's blood was familiar with the Big Dream and the Spirit Quest. Such a soul did not have to die locked with that of a weakling- it could cross over to reanimated Kaskar's empty body. Perhaps the judgment at the Final Gate wouldn't be too harsh after all, for the soul, and heart, of a hero far outweighs that of a coward....	2004-04-18

I've listened to a great deal of chant and this recording is special. Perhaps it is because the choir of the Abbey of Hellouin is composed of both Olivetian Benedictine monks and the sisters of Le Bec from the order of St. Frances the Roman. You can find all male chant, and you can find all female chant, but this perfect blending of the two is almost unique.<br />I wouldn't be too concerned with worrying that this is &quot;Catholic&quot; music, for this is Holy music from a time before there was Catholic and Protestant- or Catholic and Orthodox for that matter (though the east does have a separate tradition of chant.) For that matter, the Abbey of Hellouin also includes chant from both Byzantine and Protestant traditions in their ecumenical repertoire- but not on this recording. For that matter, it is pointed out that other religious traditions such as the Tibetan, Hindu, and American Indian all have their own variations of holy chant.<br />This is a coordinated production of not only the excellent recording, but also of a beautifully designed hard cover booklet with a pocket in front for storing the CD. This book is illustrated with well-chosen illustrations of historical paintings, illustrated manuscripts, drawings, and photographs. The general history of chant is covered, but also, the rest of the text is co-coordinated so that you can follow along with the meaning of the music, selection by selection.<br />As for the content, the entire liturgical year is covered: Jerusalem (Urbs Jerusalem, Da pacem, laetatus sum, Ecce quam bonum), Holy Week (Ubi caritas, Ecce vidimus sum, Lamentation, Ecce quomodo), Easter (Haec dies, Victimae paschali laudes), Pentecost (Caritas dei, Alleluia veni sancte spiritus, Veni sancte spiritus), Psalm for the Office of Advent (O Dieu sauveur, Conditor aime siderum, Jerusalem, Aspiciens a longe, Ecce Nomen Domini, Alma redemptoris mater), Mass of advent (Ad te levavi, Kyrie eleison, Universi, Alleluia, Preface, Dicite pusillanimes, Notre Pere.)<br />I could listen to this music every single day.s of advent (Ad te levavi, Kyrie eleison, Universi, Alleluia, Preface, Dicite pusillanimes, Notre Pere.)<br />I could listen to this music every single day.	2004-04-17

When the Terran Confederation finally made the great leap into interstellar space they discovered that they were not the first. They found that the vast Styor Empire enslaved two-thirds of the star systems of the known galaxy, and their inhabitants. The Styor, in spite of their vast numerical and technological superiority, found that it was never worth the effort and losses to try to enslave the upstart Terrans. Yet, they could not ignore the Earthmen either, for they were popping up everywhere. So the Styor allowed the newcomers to operate as traders- an occupation unfit for imperial bureaucrats and warriors. The Earthmen accepted this status, for it allowed them to travel to the enslaved worlds where the Patrol could not yet venture. They kept their eyes open and noted the growing cracks in the decadent Empire. Here and there they could do what they could to widen those cracks.<br />This was the case on the planet Klor, where Kade Whitehawk, Amerindian of the Northwest Terran Confederation noticed that the vast grasslands of that world were distinctly reminiscent of his plains homeland. The enslaved native race of Klor, the Ikkinni, reminded Whitehawk of his own people, the Lakota. They only lacked one essential to fight back against their Styor masters- the horse. Kade could get horses- and if a few managed to slip away....<br />After all, had not Whitehawk's own people accomplished the impossible when they won back their own land from the mechanized civilization that had once tried to enslave them?	2004-04-12

Then he had in reality been forced into that shadowy underground world when no one else would have him. But, he was a cut above the men that he had to deal with- and this inevitably made him enemies. In fact, he had eaten his final meal and resigned himself to meet the assassins that shadowed him. Time spent in combat and in prison had led him to look deeper inside himself than most men ever do - or perhaps should. He was ready to end this travesty of an existence one way or another. It was then that the infamous Dr. Jorge Petronius introduced himself....<br /> The good doctor told Tregarth of the legend of the Siege Perilous- the seat that could judge a man, determine his true worth, and deliver him to his fate. In legend, only Percival and Galahad had ever escaped the judging unscathed. Now it was Simon's term- and he was far from a pure knight.<br /> The world to which he found himself transported was far from a paradise. It was an ancient world truly ruled by sword and sorcery.

However, there is a sizable minority of souls whose focus, and origin, is not of this earth. These are the Earth Angels as Dr. Virtue terms them. They are not here primarily for material and mundane concerns. Rather, they are the light workers put here for higher reasons- to teach, to protect, to heal.<br />This well produced little pocket guide is a well organized introduction to all categories of \\"Earth Angel\\":<br />1) The actual incarnated angels who come from the ranks of the beings historically termed angels (to heal and serve), 2) the incarnated elementals who originate in the realm of nature spirits (to protect the natural realm- and enjoy themselves while doing so), 3) the star people from extraterrestrial, if not extra-dimensional, origins (to heal, help, and keep our civilization from committing species-wide suicide), 4) the walk-ins from many realms (those who take the opportunity to make use of a life and body that would have otherwise been wasted) and 5) the wise ones with old souls and many previous incarnations as sorceresses, priestesses, wizards, or shamans (to teach and practice the mystic and magical.)<br />You know deep down whether your primary focus, your center, lies in this world or the next. Yet, both the test in this book, as well as the nicely done descriptions of each of the specific categories serve as reassuring validation. And there is a reason that so many of us are here at this time. As the author points out, the old systems such as governments, corporations and churches are beginning to fall.

For that is what this excellently crafted novel deals with, the end of that noble service after 1000 years as guardians of peace and order in the First Galactic Empire.<br /><br />It is a time of decadence and dissolution in the Empire. Sector wars are carrying off more and more worlds from Central Control. Individual bureaucrats are usurping their positions to carve out private kingdoms. Only the incorruptible Patrol and its Code remain to stand in their way. Yet, the Patrol has seen better days. Their ships are old and there are no replacements- only cannibalization keeps them running. The supply ships come less and less often. Communications between sectors- and with Central Control itself is breaking down. There are fewer and fewer new recruits. The only thing still as strong as ever is the dedication, honor, and tradition of the Patrol.<br /><br />Specifically, this is the story of the last voyage of the Vegan Scout, Starfire. She was sent on a final, futile mission, along with her sister ships to remap and rediscover forgotten worlds near the galactic rim. In reality, she has been sent out by an ambitious Imperial bureaucrat to die- yet due to their ancient trust and loyalty the patrol obeys. Her Patrol crewmen and elite Rangers (think of them as Marine Scouts, but with finely trained telepathic powers) finally crash land on a world so ancient that all record of it has been lost. But sometimes endings come full circle- and beginnings are found and restored....<br /><br />If there had been no other creator of hard science fiction, or of fantasy, in the second half of the 20th century, Andre Norton would have been enough.	2004-04-03

Drury, an anthropologist by training, makes a solid, knowledgeable case that the \\"rising in the planes\\" and path working of the western magus is of a similar nature, if not originally rooted in, the shaman's journey.<br />First of all, this book gives one of the best in-print descriptions that I've seen of the history and workings of shamanism. He shows that the various global traditions are tied together by an altered state of consciousness in which the practitioner does not merely experience some degree of psychic dissociation, but is also able to retain the ability to consciously interact during this state. In other words, the shaman is able to control the trance dimension and explore the realms of the cosmos that such a state opens for him. This is what differentiates him from the passive medium or mystic- or the involuntary schizophrenic.<br />In terms of historical background, the most interesting fact for me was that Plato drank of the sacred potion at Eleusis and experienced visions that were essentially shamanic in nature. This is how he knew of the Ideal world of the Archetypes- he directly experienced them. Similarly, the most ancient spiritual teachings of the Indian Rig Vedas seem to have originated in Soma induced trance. Mankind's most ancient and respective spiritual traditions are all based in the fact that a shaman crossed over to obtain wisdom- and brought it back for the benefit of all.<br />However, Drury also explains that hallucinogenic drugs are by no means the only way to induce a shamanic quest. Even when they are used, they are no more than a catalyst. The key state can be reached through sensory deprivation, breath control, meditative silence, mantric chanting, drumming- and the near-death experience. Drugs are not necessary- and may even hinder the proper trance state in some subjects.<br />The heart of the book, though, lies in comparing the shamanic tradition with modern magical practice. Drury first shows that modern magic is properly divided between 1) formal ceremonial magic of ritual and invocation and 2) the inner visualization, and deep trance state, of the magician that relies on out-of-the-body voyaging or \\"rising in the planes.\\" It is shown that while the first has many symbolic, vestigial similarities to shamanism (such as the Qabalistic Tree of Life being a symbolic expression of the primal World Tree of the shaman) it is fundamentally different from shamanism in practice. It is pointed out that western ceremonial magic reflects the imbalances of the entire western civilization in that it is all about force and control of higher forces through the will of the practitioner. The shaman does not seek to command or control higher powers. He instead acts as diplomat and negotiator. He acts out of respect and brotherhood and not arrogance and ego. In short, the western magician seeks to distort the natural order by controlling the will of God. This is a total distortion of shamanic practice of restoring the natural, or divine, balance. On the other hand, the trance magician that seeks to journey to the higher planes to interact in respect and harmony does indeed follow in the tradition of the shaman's path.heart of the book, though, lies in comparing the shamanic tradition with modern magical practice.

Now, 26 years later, My current journal is once again an Avenel.<br />Indeed, I purchased my first Avenel blank book some time before I started keeping a regular record simply because I liked the look and feel of it. I felt sure that I'd find some eventual use for it. It has a nice leatherette cover that isn't too far from the real thing. The cover itself is embossed with a gilt geometric-floral Victorian pattern. The end papers are also of an attractive floral pattern. The pages number approximately 192 (which is enough to last me for 3 to 4 month's of journal-keeping.) After well over 20 years the unlined pages have barely yellowed, nor has the leatherette cover cracked. This is a high quality book that should last several lifetimes.	2004-03-24

I found that this book is really a continuation of _Many Lives, Many Masters_. However, instead of focusing upon a single case study, this time the author covers many cases of hypnotic regression. There are several reasons for these regressions arranged by section: healing physical problems, healing relationships, healing the inner and abused child, correcting obesity and eating disorders, correcting substance abuse, achieving mystical or spiritual insights, and regression simply to enrich one's overall experience of the wonder of life. The cases examined tend to be brief but to the point.<br />The last chapter covers the technique of hypnotic regression (both conventional and past-life) in more detail. Additional techniques of past-life exploration are also examined such as dream analysis, meditation and visualization, self-awareness techniques, and &quot;play&quot; techniques. It is significant that the author emphasizes that regression can usually be safely achieved by self-hypnosis without benefit of an &quot;expert.&quot; In fact, the appendix contains the transcript for a self-hypnosis tape (do NOT listen to it in the car!)<br />There are also some more extensive historical and philosophical insights in this book. this includes the fact that reincarnation was initially accepted by the Christian faith until it became the state religion of Rome. Both the Emperor Constantine, as well as the later church hierarchy, rejected the doctrine for political and control reasons. It is also pointed out that an underground of mystical movements such as the Gnostics, Cathars, Sufis, and Kabbalists have always accepted reincarnation as a core spiritual belief (indeed, life hardly makes sense with out it.)<br />One additional note: Dr. Weiss actually found out who the &quot;Robert Jarrod&quot; was that needed his help from his previous experience with Catherine.<br />All in all, I found this book to be even more interesting and informative than Many Lives, Many Masters.	2004-03-19

It is a trim, quality volume with an emerald green cover embossed in gold. The dust jacket is also beautifully done with reproductions from the full-color plates inside the volume. This is a book that will last. There is also a new introduction by Owen Perkins.<br />These are myths that predate those of the Greeks, with power and meaning every bit as great. These are the foundation myths of the Celts of old Briton. They are all here: the tales of the Tuatha de Danann and the Fomors, of Cuchulainn, of Chonchobar, of Conn and Cormac, of Finn mac Coul and the Fenians, and of Arthur himself. Indeed, Squire was one of the first scholars to free Arthur and his knights from the clutches of the Normans and their thieving decedents.<br />The book itself is divided into three parts: 1) an introductory section on the source works, the history of the ancient Britons, and the religion of the same, 2) the Gaelic Gods and their stories, and 3) the British Gods and their stories. There is also section on survivals of ancient Celtic paganism into \\"modern times\\" (i.e. the early 20th century.) A bibliography of source works is included, as well as a pronunciation guide, and a full index. There is a four-page section of full-color plates of marvelous heroic paintings.<br />I've owned and read several newer accounts of these myths (both new-age and scholarly) but this is the one I get down to read by the fire when my soul needs renewal.	2004-03-17

The minute I picked this volume up I knew that it was something special. I have several dictionaries and encyclopedias on occult and esoteric topics but there is just something about this one that I had to have. First of all, as I flipped through looking for the subjects that I am primarily interested in, I found that they were all there. Then, when I looked up a few topics that I had questions about, they were there as well. The definitions were concise, pithy, and to the point. In addition the design of the book is elegant and the accompanying illustrations were selected with taste. The back cover states that this dictionary is a browser's delight- and that is a perfect description. The more I browse it, the more respect I have for the editor's knowledge and perspective.<br />As for the contents, you have literally everything: magical formulae; the nature of spiritual beings; the meanings of signs, symbols, and secret rites; astrology; numerology; tarot; historical accounts of hauntings and psychic occurrences; biographies of leading figures in the field, their lives, philosophies, and writings; religious and esoteric texts such as the Egyptian coffin texts, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Zohar; great legends and myths of the world; folklore from around the world; the nature of transpersonal psychology; and no doubt much more that I haven't found yet. All of it is written with clear focused understanding- and often that little helpful obscure fact that you weren't familiar with.<br />You could do far worse than to make this your primary reference for the mystic, occult, and esoteric. Indeed, I have not seen better.<br />It should be noted that this is a totally revised evolution of the editor's earlier _Dictionary of Mysticism and the Occult_.	2004-03-15

It has a simulated embossed leatherette cover in dark blue with a full color printed insert of the Hindenburg. It is profusely illustrated with many full color and crisp black-and-white photographs and drawings.<br />The first chapter deals primarily with Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin's development of the first practical, navigable, rigid airship in 1900. Also included is a history of experimentation and speculation prior to this date. Early non-German efforts such as the Lebaudy, Nulli Secundus, and America are depicted and discussed. The efforts of Santos-Dumont are examined. The pre-war accomplishments of the German Airship Transport Company (DELAG) are detailed.<br />The second chapter deals with the use of the airship during the First World War. Both the German Naval and Army Airship Services are covered. A detailed account of German bombing missions over England is given. Also included is an account of the long-range relief mission of the L-59 to German East Africa. The British rigid fleet (eight British rigids flew during the war), as well as, the blimp fleet, is also briefly examined.<br />The third chapter deals with between-the-wars development. The chapter starts with the 1919 visit of the British R-34 to the United States. The specifications and histories of the great United States airships Shenandoah and Los Angeles are covered next. The ill-fated mission of the Norge to the North Pole is included. Finally, the construction and magnificent record of the Graf Zeppelin is detailed.<br />The fourth chapter continues on with the world cruises of the Graf Zeppelin. The excellent British R-100 and the troubled R-101 are covered. The construction and operational history of the American U.S.S. Akron (ZRS-4) is examined in some detail.<br />The fifth chapter continues with the career of the Akron. The metalclad ZMC-2 is briefly touched upon. The life and death of the U.S.S. Macon (ZRS-5) is covered. The history of the Hindenberg rounds off the chapter and the book. However, it is pointed out that the Graf Zeppelin II was launched in 1938 (the original Graf was honorably retired in 1937) and took part in military recon missions to probe electronic and radar defenses of Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Netherlands, and Great Britain. A one-paragraph description of United States Navy nonrigid blimp operations during the war is given. There is no mention of post-war developments or missions.<br />All in all this is an excellent one-volume history of pre-WWII rigid airship development. It should be noted that such development did not halt forever at that time, as this book seems to suggest, and that such vessels may even hold some promise for the future.The life and death of the U.S.S.

It has rightfully been called THE sourcebook of western magic (or at least of the Renaissance rediscovery of the Art.). It is recorded that the magus Dr. John Dee always kept a copy open on his desk at Mortlake for ready reference. Even today many of us keep Agrippa's masterpiece out and ready- some for reference, others to merely impress. This edition edited by Donald Tyson is probably the best that has ever been produced. It is clear, clean, and appropriately illustrated. Further, while I usually ignore editor's notes and appendixes in a source work, in this case, they add considerably to the understanding of the work. He even points out errors that have stood for nearly 500 years now.<br />The basic, uniting principle of this mammoth volume is the Soul of the World. This is the traditional Greek concept (Agrippa was clearly a Neo-Platonist) of an intermediary world-soul that mediates between the One and the material world. This is the basis of all natural magic. This is what interconnects all of Agrippa's vast system of astrology, numerology, alchemy, Kabala, seals, talismans, lists of correspondences, etc. Everything in the cosmos emanates downward from the highest Source. Moreover, hidden currents and vibrations interconnect the lower with the higher in sympathetic union.<br />As much as I value this classic book, if I wanted a single volume for practical use and reference I would probably choose _The Magician's Companion_ by Bill Whitcomb (another Llewellyn publication.) However, I would still keep this book in my master collection with the rest of the great source works.	2004-03-11

Yet, there seemed to be so little information available about him, only bits and pieces and rumors- often spread by his enemies. Here is a most satisfying biography that not only gives you a complete look at the Doctor's life, but is also supplemented with a wealth of associated detail and historical background. This book turns Dee from a shadowy character to a real man, a great man.<br /> What comes across is the amazing breadth and depth of Dee's interests and scholarship. He was already famed for his remarkable intellect and ability as a student at Cambridge. At a time when most scholars barely processed a reading knowledge of bad Latin, he mastered classical Greek to be able to read the forgotten works of Plato and Pythagoras. He was a personal friend and correspondent to the great men of the age such as Tycho Brahe and Mercator. Dee himself was famed as a great mathematician in Europe (at a time when simple trigonometry was almost unknown in England.) He was offered high positions at the great courts of Europe, but turned these offers down out of a deep seated desire to raise up his country of birth to be their eventual global equal (at this time England was a poor, backward, weak backwater.) Indeed, the first conception of a British Empire, founded upon a strong Royal Navy, was first expounded by Dee.<br /> John Dee was as close to modern scientist as existed in the 16th century. He independently came to the conclusion that bodies of unequal weight fall at the same rate- before Galileo. He was recognized as England's top expert on optics and lenses. He was recognized as one of the top experts on navigation and chart making of his day. He kept detailed astronomical observations that even Tycho Brahe admired. He based his astrological work upon the heliocentric \\"heresy\\" of Copernicus. He was an expert in geology and ores and leased his own tin mine. He also collected the biggest research library of the age in Mortlake, which was a gathering place of the greatest minds of England and the continent. In short- Dee was a competent expert in several areas of natural philosophy and applied technology. He believed in detailed observation and record keeping- in both natural, and supernatural, phenomena.<br /> The thing is, Dee believed his accomplishments in the more material and practical sciences to be among his lesser accomplishments. Like Newton after him, his real passion was with the deepest cosmic and spiritual secrets. This led to his fame as an astrologer, and an alchemist, and a cabalist. Dee's passion was to discover the ancient, true, original religion of mankind, the \\"prisci theology.\\" That is why he could walk easily among both Protestants and Catholics- he ultimately considered both of their dogma's to be equally absurd. Dee had a much more open mind that the \\"scientists\\" of later centuries- he studied all unknown forces, natural or supernatural. This was why be studied and practiced natural magic (Agrippa's three books were always open upon his desk for quick reference.) He knew that hidden currents influenced the day-to-day world, and he documented his observations even if he couldn't explain them in terms of material cause and effect. This also led to his interest is scrying and the use of natural sensitives to communicate with spirits. It should be noted, that no one at this time doubted the existence of such spirits- it was as self evident as the existence of God. In fact, many powerful lords of the day employed seers and scryers, including the earls of Leicester, Pembroke, and Northumberland.<br /> All in all, you come away with a renewed respect for Dee. You realize that his only fault was to be born in a society of petty, ignorant, lesser men. It was they that libeled and slandered his image and painted him as a superstitious conjuror. Indeed, the only real mistake that the good Doctor made was to outlive his beloved queen and protector.eloved queen and protector.	2004-03-06

This is the third time that I've read this book over the years, and no doubt it will not be the last.<br /> Just because this is a book on reincarnation, and past life regression, many people dismiss it a simple-minded, new age, drivel. I know that I almost did. That would have been an arrogant mistake, and a stupid loss, on my part. Take a look at the author's credentials: a Phi Beta Kappa, Magna cum Laude graduate of Columbia; a M.D. from the Yale University School of Medicine; Chief of Psychiatry at a major hospital; over 37 papers and book chapters published in his field, a recognized expert on brain chemistry. In short, this man wasn't jeopardizing his career to make a quick buck. It pretty well shook his world to the foundations when he discovered that reincarnation and the evolution of the soul were reality. As he points out, until they personally experience the reality of the existence and survival of the soul then most people simply will not, cannot, accept it. Then, once they do accept it, then they find that there are literally libraries full of legitimate research that confirms it all.<br />The main text of the book reads more like a novel than a scientific or spiritual work. The main case that shattered the doctor's previous beliefs is unfolded in exactly the way that it happened to him. The past life hypnotic regression of the subject is recounted practically word for word - including the words of the Masters.<br />What struck me was the agreement of everything that came from the Masters (sages at the highest plane spiritual evolution) with the perennial wisdom teachings that stretch back through all human history and all traditional cultures. It is all there: the fact that we are here primarily to learn and grow; that we are to learn to see the that spark of God in both others and ourselves; that only God may take a life; the importance of harmony, balance, and simplicity; to do good for the sake of good alone- with no expectation of reward; and of course the survival of the soul and the cycle of rebirth and spiritual evolution. Indeed without the latter, human existence would hardly make sense.<br />It all sounds simple, but you only really gain such wisdom by slowly applying and living it- by turning the theoretical into the internalized. This is what you take with you, and what you bring back with you on your next cycle of birth and death- the eternal wisdom that you have welded eternally to your soul by actually living it.urse the survival of the soul and the cycle of rebirth and spiritual evolution.

Take a look at the author's credentials: a Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude graduate of Columbia; a M.D. from the Yale University School of Medicine; Chief of Psychiatry at a major hospital; over 37 papers and book chapters published in his field; a recognized expert on brain chemistry. In short, this man wasn't jeopardizing his career to make a quick buck. It pretty well shook his world to the foundations when he discovered that reincarnation and the evolution of the soul were reality. As he points out, until they personally experience the reality of the existence and survival of the soul then most people simply will not, cannot, accept it. Then, once you do accept it, then you find that there are literally libraries full of legitimate research that confirms it all.<br />The main text of the book reads more like a novel than a scientific or spiritual work. The main case that shattered the doctor's previous beliefs is unfolded in exactly the way that it happened to him. The past life hypnotic regression of the subject is recounted practically word for word - including the words of the Masters.<br />What struck me was the agreement of everything that came from the Masters (sages at the highest plane of spiritual evolution) with the perennial wisdom teachings that stretch back through all human history and all traditional cultures. It is all there: the fact that we are here primarily to learn and grow; that we are to learn to see that spark of God in both others and ourselves; that only God may take a life; the importance of harmony, balance, and simplicity; to do good for the sake of good alone- with no expectation of reward; and of coursethe survival of the soul and the cycle of rebirth and spiritual evolution. Indeed without the latter, human existence would hardly make sense.<br />It all sounds simple, but you only really gain such wisdom by slowly applying and living it- by turning the theoretical into the internalized. This is what you take with you, and what you bring back with you on your next cycle of birth and death- the eternal wisdom that you have welded eternally to your soul by actually living it.	2004-03-04

When Kurtz exclaims &quot;The Horror! The Horror!\\" it is in the same sense that we would also cry out if suddenly faced with the unshielded countenance of God. At the threshold, just before we were either consumed, or absorbed, this too would be our cry.<br /><br />This most remarkable of books is a dissection of the Western psyche. We start with the capital city of the living dead in Europe itself. This is a land of sleepwalkers who have never awakened- they live out their lives spinning castles in the air that ultimately mean nothing. This is the state of the modern Western mind. Theory and profit, but no soul. On the journey down the African coast we encounter the European battleship antiseptically shelling the coast. These are transplanted westerners hiding in the shells of their technological terrors while lobbing shells into the outer world- without really being contaminated by it. Then we reach the coast, where the high ideals preached in Europe are more and more obviously abandoned the farther inland one travels. When the land and the natives become &quot;difficult&quot;, pure force and brutality are used to overcome and destroy.<br /> In other words, if they will not be &quot;westernized&quot;, turned into copies of us, they must be obliterated. Preferably while making us a profit.<br /><br />Kurtz was a strong man. He was ambitious and powerful. Perhaps he kept up the charade of &quot;civilizing&quot; the natives and the land in the name &quot;progress&quot; longer than anyone else. He kept up these empty lies until he penetrated to the deepest core of the primeval jungle. And then, this hollow shell of ideals and greed imploded. You see, as Conrad points out, Kurtz was fundamentally hollow. Yet Kurtz didn't just die, he was too strong. Instead, into that vacuum rushed the primal force itself. Kurtz became what he hated the most- he became the soul of the jungle- because he had none of his own. He became an &quot;animal&quot; in its highest sense, a totally natural man. Indeed he became a natural King, as the native tribes recognized. He and the land were truly one.<br /><br />It is a mistake to judge Kurtz by the standards of the city of the dead. Kurtz and his warriors sweeping across the jungle, taking heads and ivory as trophies, was as natural as lions running down gazelles.... Far more natural than the hypocritical, brutal, soulless, enslavement of the coastal natives in the name of &quot;civilization&quot;....ral man.

This is what results when you forcibly amputate the &quot;Holy&quot; from Holy Russia. This is what is left- ashes, and stone, and zombies. It is a place of the living dead. Even the sadism of the police seems to lack any real animating passion. It is just a job, and if they are not brutalizing and humiliating someone (anyone really) then they aren't doing their job. Nothing personal. Even when the faceless, brutalized masses finally fight back there is no real heroism involved. It has as little meaning as a stampede at the stockyard....<br /> I've heard this book compared to Jack London's _The Iron Heel_ and Orwell's _1984_. I'd have to agree, this is the purely visual expression of the same anti-totalitarian theme. It works. If you really take it in, then it can't fail to give you nightmares. You can tell that the artist was raised under the specter of the Gulag. That's the difference, if an American tried a similar work it would have come across as just another horror show or comic book- a Russian does it and it comes across as a plausible reality. Maybe that explains why this work hasn't found a wider readership in the U.S.- no one wants to reflect on what it represents.<br /> Don't get the idea that this is only about the &quot;Gulagocaust&quot;, for it isn't. It isn't even a condemnation of true socialism, for it is pointed out that the \\"socialist camp\\" had nothing really to do with socialism, but everything to do with camps. As is pointed out in both the introduction and afterword this book is about any system where people are treated as lifeless statistics. It could just as well represent the coming global world of corporate totalitarianism.<br />Reflect on this book two or three times some evening before turning in. If it doesn't give you nightmares then you haven't really been paying attention.<br />How do you know if your society is slipping into this nightmare?

Come to think of it, he is probably my favorite. There is just something so completely unique about his work. The drawing is like the old 30's era animated cartoons, but on acid. The storylines and dialog are somewhere between existentialism and nihilism (must depend on what kind of day the creator is having.) I don't know what makes Kaz see the world like this, but he needs to keep doing it.<br />This collection contains probably his best work: The Tragedy of Satan, Little B*stard, Zak Smoke in the Necronaut, Goodbye Sun, and of course, Sidetrack City.

It is just so perfectly humane. This isn't a &quot;primitive&quot; society- it is just a society that fully conforms to the natural, traditional way that humans were meant to live. You don't get a sense that this society is just copying Native American culture here, on the contrary, you get a sense that these people are being completely themselves in intimate interconnection with the natural world around them. When you do this it just naturally begins to parallel the Native Americans- without conscious effort.<br />It is appropriate that LeGuinn brings up the Tao te Ching in the introduction. This is a way of life perfectly in accordance with the Tao. The first time I read this book I did not yet realize what a perfect symbol the double spiral motif that runs through all the book, all the society, is. I now get it. You slowly spiral in to the center- then you slowly spiral on out- or up.<br /> In spite of the fact that they retain some modern knowledge of technology- appropriate technology- this it isn't a life without work. It isn't a fantasy utopia. Yet, I wouldn't hesitate a second to go there.<br />Another thing, the section on healthy vs. unhealthy generative metaphors for different societies is worth the price of the book alone. Briefly, this compares and contrasts such metaphors as THE WAR, THE LORD, THE MACHINE with those of THE ANIMAL, THE DANCE, THE HOUSE, and THE WAY. It really gets you to think about how the underpinning way that we see the world produces different outcomes.<br />One other thing. I don't think I've ever seen a case where illustrations, maps, songs, poems, myths, tales, etc. all interweave and compliment each other so seamlessly. I didn't think people were smart enough to consciously create a work like this- I'm gratified that at least one person was this smart.<br />I really want to read this again, soon.	2004-02-19

In the introduction, it is pointed out that people in these decades had a special need to believe in a better future, because the present, and immediate past, had been so grim. In the 20's people tried to forget the meat grinder of the Great War, in the 30's they tried to get their minds off of the Great Depression, in the 40's they needed to believe that they were fighting for a better world to justify the sacrifices of the Second World War, and in the 50's there was the Cold War and the Bomb to forget.<br /> These images are strictly pop futurism. Almost none of them came from professional designers or engineers. Many are from advertisements. The rest of them are largely from magazines like Popular Science, pulps, and supplements to the Sunday newspaper. The emphasis wasn't on hard science and practicality here, it was on armchair dreams of a better future. Here you have pictures of personal helicopters and flying cars. There are also picture phones and robot lawn mowers. You have many versions of the house of the future, and the great towering cities of the future. There are bases and colonies in space. Even the few depictions of warfare are of the sanitized and automated sort. This was a bright, clean, colorful future for all (everyone seemed to be at the same upper middleclass level of plenty and comfort- there are no excessively rich or poor to be seen.) You quickly realize that this is where the creators of the Jetsons must have drawn much of their inspiration.<br /> In short, these are images of a time when people still believed in the future.<br /> The book itself is almost all illustration with no accompanying text. You are intended to browse through and get an over all feeling for the spirit of the age, the zeitgeist. There is a short, perceptive, three-page introductory essay to set the mood. It is repeated in both German and French- though you really don't have to read any language to appreciate this collection.<br /> My one small criticism is that the pages are not numbered. This makes it impossible to refer anyone else to a specific illustration.<br /> This is the future that I was raised to believe in- and with any luck it still isn't too late to bring it into manifestation....and French- though you really don't have to read any language to appreciate this collection.<br /> My one small criticism is that the pages are not numbered.

This is demonstrated by the uneducated slave in Meno that is able to independently generate certain mathematical formulas without prior exposure to them. While it is not explored here, this obviously ties in with Plato's exposure to, and acceptance of, Orphic and/or Pythagorean doctrines of reincarnation.<br />The author makes it very clear that this theory was intended to account for only knowledge of the Forms. It was never meant to account for mundane and technical knowledge. Concerning this form of learning Plato was a quite capable empiricist. Recollection, as expounded by Plato, was meant to deal only with philosophical/metaphysical knowledge. Moreover, since recollection was seen as the necessary first stage of philosophizing, then only philosophers (or those well on their way to become philosophers) could recollect.<br />The argument of innate vs. empirical learning is expanded to cover both the ancient world and the present day. A large portion of the second part covers Aristotle's empiricist rejection of his master's thoughts on the subject (which may indeed be the entire origin of the current continuing argument.) The stand of both the Epicureans and the Stoics is presented in the chapters on the Hellenistic schools. The historical development of the arguement is continued on through the present day and the innatism of the Cambridge Platonists.<br />This is a lengthy and exhaustive examination, but it is rewarding to those seriously interested in the concepts of innate knowledge and the role of intuition in metaphysical thought. Secondly, it indicates the existence of the straight jacket imposed by Aristotelian logic upon this subject. In a larger sense, this book points to where modern thinking went astray of its traditionalist roots.	2004-02-09

It demonstrates the debt that western occult philosophy and practice owes to Greek thought. As the author points out you can hardly open any book on this subject without finding Plato and Plotinus on every page.<br /> The history of Greek mystical and magical thought is traced progressively from Archaic and Classical Greece, to the growth of the Mysteries, to the wider Hellenistic period, to Gnosticism, to Middle Platonism, to the Greek New Testament, to Neoplatonism, to the Renaissance, to 19th and 20th century occult societies (Golden Dawn, Theosophical Society, Rosicrucian, Fraternitas Saturni, Aurum Solis, etc.) An especially good case is made for cabalistic thought being as much, or more, Greek as Hebrew in nature.<br /> Yet, in spite of the main purpose of showing Greek influence, the author doesn't hesitate to point out the roots of Orphism and Pythagorianism may very well have been influenced by Siberian Shamanism.<br />  I have only two comments about the content. First, the author does an excellent job of condensing all that is know about the nature of the various mysteries. He also makes some perceptive speculations of his own. However, he misses what has long been obvious to me- namely, that at least at Eleusis, the Greater mysteries involved an induced near death experience in the subterranean chambers. Also, while a comprehensive appendix concerning Isopsephos (numerical values of Greek words and names), I couldn't help but notice that there is no interpretation of 999....	2004-02-07

Of course you can do it alone, as I did, but the author points out that it is nice to have a knowledgeable second party to make sure that you didn't miss something- and that you are truly applying reason and not rationalization.<br /> The use of case studies for specific problem areas is quite informative: seeking a relationship, maintaining a relationship, ending a relationship, family life and strife, work, midlife crisis, the reason for morals and ethics, finding meaning and purpose, and gaining from loss.<br /> The way that individual philosophers and their ideas are introduced is quite well done (theme, refrain, greatest hits, and a thumbnail abstract of their core ideas.) The basics of their systems are outlined nicely, which helps in deciding which to pursue later. I was amazed that so many of the great thinkers that that I had painstakingly discovered over the years were included.<br /> If you would like to delve a little deeper into the various philosophers without tackling the source works I recommend _Basic Teachings of the Great Philosophers_ by S.E. Frost.	2004-02-04

If you are a college educated American and underemployed (i.e. working at a job that does not utilise your specific degree, or ANY degree) then you are far from alone. Over half of all college graduates are in the same boat. This figure is even higher for liberal arts and sciences graduates. You did nothing &quot;wrong&quot;- the economy just hasn't been able to generate enough good jobs since the '60's.<br />A big part of the problem was the high level decision to move manufacturing jobs out of the country. This meant the loss of tens of millions of mid-level management jobs that should have gone to college graduates. The plan in the 60's was for American industry to modernise and automate (and train workers) to overcome low-wage foriegn competition. However, instead of following this government endorsed long-range plan, most manufacturers simply moved their manufacturing off shore to utilise the cheaper labor. This was cheaper and easier than developing efficient high-tech facilities in the U.S.<br />Secondly, there was a complete disconnect between the needs of industry, and the numbers and type of training in the colleges and universities. For the most part business and higher education mistrusted each other and excluded each other from each other's decision making. This resulted in millions of college grads whose training bore no resemblance to the actual practical needs of industry. Nor were most graduates trained to think in terms of starting their own businesses- it was indoctrinated into them that they would naturally work for large corporations that would &quot;look after&quot; their career development.<br />So cheer up if you could never found a job that matched your training. It wasn't your fault. It was a failure of &quot;economic democracy.&quot;	2004-02-01

It's all there: a sensitive, &quot;different&quot;, psychic youngster; the meeting with spirits in the wild early in life; the NDE that opened him up again in adult hood; &quot;Lord Fox&quot; as power animal and spirit guide; the uniting and healing of partial souls; the recognition of a calling; the helping of dead spirits across the veil; even the philosopher father writing about the boundary between the inner and outer worlds fading away. Even the Domus Mundi, the house of the world, echoes Native American teachings about the great circle of the world, of life. It's all shamanism. The main character of Will Rabjohns is a perfect candidate for this calling, for he already knows what it is like to live on the boundary between two worlds.<br />On the other hand the character of Rukenau shows the left hand path- the magus who seeks to force and distort natural and supernatural forces to serve his will. It is the difference between he who serves Balance, and he who serves Imbalance.<br />It took a lot of guts for Clive Barker to write this novel. First of all it lays much of the author's personal life and experience open to the public. Secondly, in writing about shamanism, the vast majority of the general public just isn't going to &quot;get it.&quot;	2004-01-31

Of course you have to suspend belief in certain scientific and geographical principles to enjoy them, but you are more than rewarded by the nonstop action and high adventure. If you ever yearned to explore a strange new world of marvels and monsters, then this is the series for you.<br /> This particular collection republishes three of the seven volumes in the series- including _At the Earth's Core_ which was the first. Pellucidar, in case you are new, is a subterranian world on the inner surface of the earth's crust. This world can be accessed by either drilling through the the crust or by natural openings at the poles. Burroughs inhabited this world with a rich variety of marvels almost around ever corner. These stories are a nonstop collection of survival, exploration, and empire building in strange and savage lands.<br /> If you enjoy this collection then you'll also want to track down _Tarzan at the Earth's Core_ where ERB sends his greatest character into his greatest setting.<br /> These books are especially good for escaping from the dissappointments and frustrations of daily life.

This particular edition is the first to be offered to the non-wizarding public.<br />The introduction covers the classification of magical creatures into beings, beasts, or spirits. The history, politics, and fine points of this division is examined.<br />Next, there is a section on the concealment of magical beasts from the non-wizarding public. This includes the establishment of safe habitats, as well as the use of disillusionment charms, memory charms, and other techniques. The activities of the Office of Misinformation in spreading false information are also examined.<br />The Ministry of Magic classifications of all known magical creatures from XXXXX (known wizard killer) to X (positively boring) are listed and defined.<br />The main body of the reference lists all known magical creatures alphabetically. The M.O.M. classification, physical description, habitat, behavior, and distribution are clearly and concisely noted for each entry.

In my opinion, this is the most accurate and convenient ephemerides in existance (it is based on the newest standards of the International Astronomical Union, as well as, the latest research conducted by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.) It is also computer typeset to eliminate human error. You have all the data you need for planet and lunar node calculation right in front of you on a single page. Plus time is based on midnight and not noon figures, so it saves you a correction in your calculations.<br />Perhaps I am old fashion in my thinking, but if you cannot use an ephemerides and a book of tables to erect a natal horoscope by hand (at least once) then you do not really understand astrology.<br />The introduction for this edition is written in English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian. The tables use standard symbolism that any user should understand regardless of language.<br />As for this volume being &quot;obsolete&quot;, the vast majority of people currently living were born between 1900 and 2000, so this will be a useful tool for many years to come.	2004-01-29

The Sacketts were fenmen (swamp men) eeking out an existance farming the little good land available to them, fishing for eels, smuggling, or going off to fight in the wars. It was the combination of the chance finding of a cache of Roman gold, along with a fight with an arrogant aristocrat, that put young Barnabas on the road to &quot;adventure.&quot;<br /> Fleeing to London, he meets the contacts that he will need to set sail for a new world and a new life. The sword fights, pirates, and sea battles that follow are not what you expect in a &quot;western&quot;, but they are quite good never-the-less. Upon surviving to reach America (after Roanoke, but before Jamestown) Barnabas rapidly sizes up the territory and the inhabitants and resolves to start his family there- far from kings and aristocrats.

A lot of hack writers have done war stories, adventure stories, and sea stories like these, but in L'Amour's case you know that he has actually been there, actually done that. I've read much of this author's work over the years, but this is probably my favorite of his books.<br />Here is a working man that has actually travelled to the rough and wild places in these stories (and when they were much rougher and much wilder.) He has done the hard labor and endured the harder conditions. This is refreshing in a period when it seems that all working people are automatically assumed to be ignorant, if not stupid. Louis L'Amour was a working man that not only loved books the whole time he was working, wandering, and fighting, but he went on to become one of the best-selling authors of the 20th century.<br /> It is funny, back when I first read this book, before I had done most of my own &quot;yondering&quot;, I read them with a sense of awe, envy, and a grain of salt. Now, when I read them it is with a sense of recognition and validation. Yup, I recognise that situation, I recognise that character. He got it exactly right.

I have carefully read it cover to cover. It is one of the best explorations of Renaissance magical practice that I have found. In fact, I have discarded lesser volumes and maintained this one.<br /> This one volume covers the formal rites and ceremonies of evocation, spells, alchemy, conjuration, possession, and exorcism. It is very well illustrated with sigils, seals, pentacles, and tools. It is clear to me that much research went into the original grimoires. Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah is a true scholar of the occult.<br /> Having said all this, I would warn the would be reader that the majority of this work deals with conjuring supernatural entities and binding them to your will. This is a foolish and dangerous practice. First of all, you are never sure of exactly what you have contacted- no matter what it CLAIMS to be. Secondly, this is a work of ego, an attempt to impose your personal will over the natural order. If your motives are impure or mistaken you risk three-fold retribution back upon yourself. I am not saying that it won't work, but is it worth this price to you?<br /> From the text it is clear to me that Shah knew the difference between Theurgia (aligning your will with the Divine will in Its service) and Goetia (using occult power to serve your own ego.)

Richmond was the chief of the Order of the Magi, which he officially resurrected in the upper Midwest in the late 19th century. Richmond was a Civil War veteran who was told of the Order by a mysterious stranger one night while he stood guard duty at Nashville. This stranger told him that he was to be his successor and eventually passed on to him the teachings of the Magi. Further, he told Richmond that he would pass through many battles in the course of the war, but that no harm would come to him. This proved true.<br />This Order of the Magi was the star religion of the ancient Chaldeans. It is said that this tradition existed 20,000 years before the birth of Christ. Indeed it was held that the three Magi of the Bible were members of this order- and that Christ himself later became an initiate. Richmond held that the Order had centers in not only Chaldea, but also Egypt and Persia. Moreover, he held that Pythagoras was a Grand Master of the Order (by way of the Egyptian temple.)<br />This book contains a collection of lectures delivered by Richmond on the history, philosophy, and practices of the Order. An interesting aspect of the Order was it's extensive use of magic squares and playing cards in divination. Richmond seems to have been a natural mathematician of considerable ability (as was also attested by his skill and mathematical analysis of the game of checkers during the 19th century heyday of that sport.)<br />This book was a pleasant surprise- I had thought that the Grand Temple Order of the Magi had once again passed from the memory of the world.	2004-01-26

I've read it through twice now and my opinion of it has not changed.<br /> While the account starts with the finds at Nag Hamadi, Egypt and traditional Gnosticism this book goes for beyond. The author states that he sees the golden thread that connects all great intuitive esoteric conditions. Indeed, he goes on to trace the thread to the Hermetic tradition, the Cathars, the Renaissance Magi, William Blake, the Rosicrucians, Freemasons, Theosophists, The Golden Dawn, and Jung. Some scholars seem to be overwhelmed by this vast chain of interconnection, but personally, I believe that a good case is made. The same perennial philosophy connects all. Indeed, it far predates the period of the traditional Gnostics that the church fought so hard to exterminate.<br /> Oh yes, what is \\"gnosticism?\\" It is intuitive spiritual knowledge emanating from a higher source. It is the knowledge of higher underlying reality coming from higher worlds. It is direct intuitive knowledge, or recollection, of the Divine. Coming directly from Above, by way of Within, it does not readily lend itself to control and censorship by church bureaucracy and its worldly masters.<br /> This edition has eight pages of relevant illustrations in the center section. It also has two excellent appendices showing 1) a historical timeline from 427 B.C. to 1987, and 2) thumbnail descriptions of the contents of all codex's found at Nag Hamadi. There is also an informative bibliography for further study, as well as a full index in back.	2004-01-25

While there is so much more than sun sign astrology to a person's life and chart, it does provide an overview of your general character- your individuality, style, goals, and drive.<br /> Scorpio is the sign of the mysterious, the complex, the intense- ruled by Mars and Pluto. However, it is also the sign of idealism, as well as of birth, sex, death, and regeneration- all the areas where a human being confronts the mysteries of the universe. This might also explain the attraction and ability of Scorpios for philosophy, religion, psychic phenomena, and the occult. At least it seems to explain it in my case.<br /> One other thing- NEVER cross a Scorpio.<br /> The image presented here of Scorpio is a simplistic one. There is much more esoteric material that could have been provided. For instance, there is no mention that the alternative sign for Scorpio is the Eagle (the higher, transformed Scorpio), as well as the Phoenix (the regenerated Scorpio, risen from his own ashes.) Still, while she didn't go into the higher symbols of the transformed Scorpio, she didn't repeat the slanders of this being a \\"cursed\\" sign either. This was especially propagated by the Church since it was Martin Luther's sun sign.<br /> The book itself is divided up into a general introduction to astrology, the planets, the zodiac, the sun sign profile of Scorpio, compatibility of Scorpio with other signs, and birthdays of famous Scorpios.<br />This last is especially appropriate since it makes this colorful little hardcover the perfect alternative to an ordinary, impersonal birthday card.	2004-01-25

After I read it, I wanted to kick myself for not learning more from it the first time.... But then, that is also covered in this story, Siddhartha's father could not protect him from the world, nor could Siddhartha protect his own son when the time came. You've got to go forth and learn these lessons yourself. It is the same archetypical patterns, with variations, over and over.<br /><br />I remember that when I first read this story it confused me that the Buddha and Siddhartha were two separate persons. Then I came to realise the truth of archetypes, and immortal paterns that resonate in many different bodies at the same time- all seemingly separate, but all really sharing the same great life. All ultimately flowing together to form the great river of life.	2004-01-24

In doing so, we see that true Wicca, and other simular traditions, have a legitimate claim to extremely ancient and profound practices dating back to the dawn of the race. The author shows parallels between the beliefs and practices in culture after culture (Mayan, Plains Indian, Siberian, Norse, Celtic, Chinese, Tibetan, Polynesian, Hindu, Greek, Etc.) He then shows connections with more historically recent traditions in Germany, Switzerland, France, Ireland, Italy, England, etc. I found it to be a magnificent and convincing synthesis.<br />I found it especially appropriate that a book about common roots should use the universal symbol of the World Tree as a starting point.<br />The author points out that when a society ceases to listen to the messages of the otherworldly dimension the results are always the same: listlessness, depression, addiction, inhumanity, and general malaise. This is the result of &quot;loss of soul.&quot; It is the natural function of the shaman to maintain the connection with the otherworld and to reclaim lost souls.<br />The next time a &quot;skeptic&quot; tries to minimalise the legitamacy and lineage of your spiritual path, you could do far worse than to refer this book to them. The connection between early Christianity and Shamanism is even explored (estatic states, speaking in tongues, spirit journeys to higher realms, helping spirits, crucifixion on the World Tree....)	2004-01-24

I am glad that I read this book because it reminded me that Anne Rice is not just a great writer of the supernatural and gothic, she is simply a great writer, period. There is nothing of the supernatural here, yet it is perhaps the most horrifying, at least for a male, of any of her books. As a measure of the effect of this book upon me, I kept reading it even after I realised what the main theme was (I had no idea when I started reading.) Not only that, but music is probably the biggest gap in my education- and yet, she not only made me appreciate it, but I actually felt like an insider in that world.<br />For the first time in ages, I actually felt myself totally caught up in the atmosphere of a book. Yet, it is by no means &quot;pure atmosphere&quot;, for there are deep and eternal lessons to be learned here about betrayal, death, worse than death, and.... rebirth and transcendance.<br /><br />If I ever find myself in Venice one day, it will be because of the lasting effect that this novel had on me....	2004-01-24

Reilly- the original &quot;slacker&quot;	Ignatius Reilly was the original slacker back when this novel was written in the early sixties- before there was a name for it. It isn't that he just avoids work for it's own sake, it is just that he just doesn't have the time or patience for what the modern commercial world considers to be work. He has better things to do with his time. You see, Ignatius is a thoroughly medieval man. His is primarily an internal life grounded and centerered in &quot;theology and geometry.&quot; According to these consistent standards, Ignatius' life, behavior, and appearance are perfectly rational and understandable. Unfortunately, Ignatius lives in mid-twentieth century America, a time and place of mind-numbing conformity, intolerance, and efficiency. He is doomed to perpetual misunderstanding and conflict.<br />That is the tragedy to this most excellent of commedies- being an intelligent misfit in a world of mind-numbing conformity. The author choose to leave it rather than conform, while Ignatius found the inner strength to fight and/or disreguard it. Neither let it possess and change them into modern mass-produced robots in the consumer society.....<br /><br />I wish that I could give it 500 stars.	2004-01-24

When Kurtz exclaims \\"The Horror! The Horror!\\", it is in the same sense that we would also cry out if suddenly faced with the unshielded countenance of God. At the threshhold, just before we were either consumed, or absorbed, this too would be our cry.<br /> This most remarkable of books is a dissection of the Western psyche. We start with the capital city of the living dead in Europe itself. This is a land of sleepwalkers who have never awakened- they live out their lives spinning castles in the air that ultimately mean nothing. This is the state of the modern Western mind. Theory and profit, but no soul. On the journey down the African coast we encounter the European battleship antiseptically shelling the coast. These are tranplanted westerners hiding in the shells of their technological terrors while lobbing shells into the outer world- without really being contaminated by it (or so they hoped.) Then we reach the coast, where the high ideals preached in Europe are more and more obviously abandoned the farther inland one travels.<br /> When the land and the natives become \\"difficult\\", pure force and brutality are used to overcome and destroy. In other words, if they will not be \\"westernised\\", turned into copies of us, they must be obliterated. Preferably while making us a profit.<br />Kurtz was a strong man. He was ambitious and powerful. Perhaps he kept up the charade of \\"civilising\\" the natives and the land in the name \\"progress\\" longer than anyone else. He kept up these empty lies until he penetraded to the deepest core of the primeval jungle. And then, this hollow shell of ideals and greed imploded. You see, as Conrad points out, Kurtz was fundamentally hollow. Yet Kurtz didn't just die, he was too strong. Instead, into that vacuum rushed the primal force itself. Kurtz became what he hated the most- he became the soul of the jungle- because he had none of his own. He became an \\"animal\\" in it's highest sense, a totally natural man. Indeed he became a natural King, as the native tribes recognised. He and the land were truly one.<br /><br />It is a mistake to judge Kurtz by the standards of the city of the dead. Kurtz and his warriors sweeping across the jungle, taking heads and ivory as trophies, was as natural as lions running down gazelles....

This is one of the few books that humble me when I contemplate it. Rather, Madam Blavatsky's knowlege and intellect humbles me. Take just about any &quot;newly rediscovered&quot; esoteric topic of any worth and you will most probably find it explained in considerable detail in either this work or _Isis Unveiled_. I am dismayed that so few people, or biliographies, give credit to Madam Blavatsky, or to the Theosophical Society that she founded. I guess we are just too &quot;quaint&quot; and &quot;old-fashion&quot; for the &quot;New Age.&quot;<br />There is just too much encyclopedic knowledge here to simply read through from scratch. You need to work up to it. Try a introductory text like _Ocean of Theosophy_ by William Q. Judge. However, do not be afraid to pick up either volume and simply &quot;browse.&quot; I still do this after all these years- and I am still surprised and amazed at what I find.<br />One further thing, there has been a considerable amount of character assassination against Madam Blavatsky in the last few years. The authors that have penned these attacks have no understanding of the matters that they address. First of all, no one was a stronger critic of seances than Madam Blavatsky. Secondly, the Society has always held that one should never charge money for spiritual matters. As for the ad hominem attacks that she was grossly obese, well, this is the lowest form of slander and doesn't deserve comment. Simply take a look at any of the surviving photographs to see the truth.<br />Concerning attacks on Theosophical concepts such as the &quot;seven races&quot; and &quot;seven globes&quot;, just keep in mind that the perenial philosophy holds that the highest part of what makes up a person pre-exists on a higher plane- and will return there after we cross over. Just remember the old gnostic concept of &quot;seven heavens.&quot; Literalism is a mistake in theosophy, just as it has proven in fundamentalist Christianity.	2004-01-24

This is inspite of the fact that the style is a bit dense for the modern reader.<br />Personally, I have always been attracted to the Stoic emphasis on inner peace and ethical living according to the example of nature and the cosmos. It is not surprising to me that Aurelius was also a great influence on Henry David Thoreau.<br /> I understand that President Clinton cited this as his favorite book, though for the life of me I cannot concieve of him as a Stoic- Epicurian perhaps, but not Stoic....<br /> I was struck by Aurelius's repeated admonition that it makes no difference whether one lives 40 years or 10,000- you will still have experienced everything, for nothing is new and everything repeats in endless cycles. He is right, once you get past 40, these repeating cycles become more and more apparent....	2004-01-24

It is, in my humble opinion, the best single volume on the subject of symbols and symbolism written in modern times.<br />Symbolism is a sacred way of looking at the outer world. It is a way of connecting the outer and inner worlds. A materialist sees, let's say an eagle, and simply sees a bird, while a symbolist sees an eagle and sees a message, a lesson, or a sermon. To the symbolist, the eagle also represents height, spirit, the sun, nobility, power, the lion of the air, etc. The symbolist doesn't totally ignore the materialist and mundane aspect of the eagle, he just realises that there is immeasurably MORE behind it.<br />The introduction of this book is an excellent essay of the symbolist mind-set. It covers symbolism in platonic thought, hermetism, renaissance thought, alchemy, heraldry, dream symbolism, as well as, the views of Goethe, Saunier, Bele, Guenon, Eliade, Scheider, and, of course, Jung.<br />The body of the book is in dictionary form with concise but comprehensive descriptions of topics from a historic and multi-cultural viewpoint. This is assisted by the many excellent line drawings, as well as, two sections of carefully chosen black and white photographs.<br />This is a book of correspondenses, of resonance, of the common rythym that connects things with a higher, sacred place. You learn that there are immeasurable depths to creation- and that you have merely been skipping across the surface of that creation like a stone across deep waters....	2004-01-24

This book, originally published in 1956, was my first introduction to comparative religion. Because the subject is essentially timeless, one could do far worse than to use it as a starting point even today. On the first page of the forward it draws the distinction between prophets and priests, and how both are found in every great religious tradition. I never forgot that. The perspective of the text is to look towards the truly prophetic and divinely inspired in all the priestly religions- to cut through the ossified forms and rituals. Above all, it points out that a worthy God, the true God, must be a God of all peoples.<br />Besides this enlightened approach to the unity of religious traditions, this book serves well in the secondary function as a reference book on the basic core beliefs, history, practices, holy days, customs, and sects of all the principle religions of the world. Well organised into sections on Brahmanic Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese Religions, Religion of Japan, and the Semitic Religions, with a full index, it is easy to quickly look up the detail you need.

I also realised why I have been so strongly drawn to Gnosticism over the years- it was the original faith, a faith hyjacked and perverted by an authoritarian, worldly, imperial, bureaucracy.<br /> There have been many Christs in many cultures: Osiris, Dionysis, Attis, Adonis, Bacchus, Mithras.... The central theme to all their stories was a son of God coming to earth, to learn, teach, and grow before being crucified on a cross of matter, and returning to the place from whence he came. This was also the central mystery in all cases: we are to realise that we too descended from another place and that we are to learn, grow and teach before we return there. This is the great truth to the Christ principle.<br /> How could this truth be a threat to anyone with a spark of spiritual insight?	2004-01-24

Perhaps this is because it is an explanation, or rather introduction, to the totality of Creation- manifest, unmanifest, higher, lower, and probable. Here are described the manifest worlds of the material plane (the least part of creation), the higher planes of more subtle states (touched upon in _The Symbolism of the Cross_ as lying along the vertical axis), and all the possible, but unmanifested worlds on any plane (which sounds remarkably like the modern conception of the &quot;multiverse.&quot;)<br />Yet, it is pointed out that all of this still falls far short of true infinity- it is a small included subset of the unlimited Source.<br />The human intersection with creation is also covered. This includes hints of &quot;non-corporial modalities&quot; of human existence and consciousness. This covers simultaneously existing aspects of human consciousness on higher planes, that ordinary waking consciousness is ordinarily unaware of (yet, which comprise the greater part of consciousness.)<br />Above all, it is emphacised that the human state is in reality only one small state of manifestation among countless others. there are an unlimited number of levels in the hierarchy of degrees of existence. Moreover, the human state occupies no priveleged place in the ensemble of universal existence- the human state is in no way &quot;metaphysically distinguished&quot; in relation to other states. It just happens to be the state where most of us find ourselves at the present. That is all it is. If there is anything &quot;special&quot; about the human state, it lies in that spark of the Divine that lies at the heart of all of us, where the divine ray intersects with gross matter. And this intersection can occur at any point on the vertical axis of creation. It is also suggested that nonhuman, never human, entities share this creation with us.<br />All of this is not just idle &quot;New Age&quot; speculation, these are the conclusions of Guenon, the great metaphysician and mathematician.Age&quot; speculation, these are the conclusions of Guenon, the great metaphysician and mathematician.	2004-01-24

I still marvel at how Prabhavananda and Manchester managed to encapsulate so much of the core content and meaning of the twelve principle Upanishads in such a slim volume. Yet they did- and it works.<br />Of course if you truly understand these oldest of mystical scriptures then you could condense them down still further to:<br />Brahma is true, the world is false,<br />The soul is Brahma and nothing else.<br />Or if that is a bit wordy for you, then you can sum up the Upanishads, and all the Vedas, with: &quot;Tat tvam asi&quot; (Thou art that.)<br />Most people need to work up to the true understanding of these statements with a bit more commentary, however....	2004-01-24

It wasn't until I reread these books that I fully appreciated them, as well as, the sophistication of the author's religious views. All through my rereading I thought that I detected references to Platonism and the Greek mysteries. Then, in the next to the last chapter in the last book of the series was my proof, when Lord Digory says, &quot;It's all in Plato.&quot; I don't know why I was surprised, afterall, Lewis was educated at Oxford and taught at Cambridge- of course he was familiar with the classics. He no doubt was familiar with Clement of Alexandria and his comments that Christianity is in reality &quot;perfected Platonism.&quot; I wouldn't be surprised if he knew of Celsius' comment, &quot;Many of the ideas of the Christians have been expressed better- and earlier- by the Greeks. Behind these views is an ancient doctrine that has existed from the beginning.&quot;<br /> Indeed, scholars have discovered that upon close analysis just about every statement and teaching attributed to Jesus is a paraphase of Plato. I do not say this disparagingly, for it is the point, and the worth, of these books. Lewis is pointing to the underlying truths of all true religion, whether one is talking of Narnia or the ancient mystery religions. This is the cosmic Christ, Christos, or Logos principle of which Aslan is a perfect example.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me, he isn't stating that all &quot;gods&quot; are the same. He makes that very clear concerning &quot;Tash.&quot; What he is saying is that whenever men do honor and worship the true GOOD, they are in fact worshiping the same thing, though they use different names. Indeed, in a sense, there has always been but one true faith in the hearts of all good men, down thru all the ages, throughout all the lands and all the worlds....	2004-01-24

Books	5	0	0	N	N	A book to be read if you survive the first half of your life	It is amazing how few people really grasp the meaning of this book. Nicholas Urfe is a typical, modern, young man. He believes in nothing- not family, not country, not duty, not God, not love. He is an egoist that imagines himself an existentialist. In the isolation of Phraxos he is forced to examine this &quot;self&quot; that is all he believes in for the first time. He finds that there is little or nothing there. This realization pushes him to the abyss. Yet he doesn't even have the strength of will to pull the trigger. This is the final blow to his world, his ego.<br /><br /> Enter the magus. This is in accordance with the ancient formula, &quot;When the student is ready, the teacher will come.&quot; Nicholas is now fertile ground with all of his preconceptions about himself and his world broken assunder. The magus now proceeds to introduce Nicholas to the Mysteries. Indeed, the greatest lesson that is taught is that the universe is more mysterious, more timeless, more boundless, more terrible and awe-full than the modern materialist mind can grasp.<br /> A clue comes in the early conversation about the novel being &quot;dead as alchemy.&quot; This is irony, you see, not only is Conchis a master alchemist when it comes to the transmutation of souls, but all great novels, including this one, are also powerful works of alchemy.<br />This entry refers to the German language translation of the novel.	2004-01-24

Actually, I thought that I was reading fiction based on actual research. Considering the scholarly listing of sources in the back of the book I do not think that I was being too gullible. After all, there actually was a 10th century Arab traveler by the name of Ibn Fadlan.<br />Then I noticed that the story was sounding more and more like Beowulf. In fact, it was like a cross between _Lord of the Rings_ and Beowulf- complete with weapon-forging dwarves in caves. I finally realized that this was what Crichton was trying to do. He was creating a plausible historical verification for the events that occur in Beowulf seen through the eyes of an outside observer. And he did it very well.<br />At first I found the picture presented of the Vikings to be disgusting. They are presented with no redeeming features at all i.e. dirty, uncouth, treacherous, drunken, lascivious pigs. But then slowly, as they travel on their heros' journey to the far north the characters slowly seem to be transformed. Traits such as humor, honor, and courage begin to show through. This continues until the leader of the party (Buliwyn) appears finally not only as the most classical of questing heroes, but also as the resurrected image of Odin himself.<br />One other thing little thing, the monsters of the mist being portrayed as cannibalistic, warlike Neanderthals seems a bit far fetched. After all, it seems that the Neanderthalers were a gentle folk who were probably exterminated by Homo sapiens that were not all that dissimilar from the Vikings....	2004-01-23

That's the marvelous thing about Space 1889, it is such a rich fantasy environment that you don't have to play it to enjoy it. Just running all the scenarios, characters, and details through your imagination can be satisfying in itself. There is also enough concentrated information on 19th military and colonial life that it is a rich resource for constructing your own independent stories.<br />First of all, the entire role-playing series is based upon Thomas Edison discovering a way to navigate the ether currents in the late 19th century, making space travel possible for the Victorians. This causes a rush by the imperial powers of Europe to establish possessions on Luna, Venus, Mars, and Mercury. While the United States has no official imperial ambitions, it also establishes a diplomatic, scientific, and trading presence on the new worlds.<br />The elaborate detail of these books is amazing. You learn so much about 19th century military organization, uniforms, weaponry (both regulars and colonial forces.) All the major powers of Europe, North and South America, and Asia are covered along with native peoples such as the Dervishes, Arabs, Abyssinians, Boers, Zulus, Sudanese, American Indians, Khmers, Afghans, etc. Then the fictional alien races such as the humanoids of Mars, the lizard men of Venus, and the selenites of Luna are covered in equal detail.<br />This book is actually divided into five sections: I. The Rules of War (miniature rules), II. The Road to War (specific campaign rules), III. The Sinews of War (military equipment, including aerial and naval vessels), IV. Army Lists (order of battle for all armies in the solar system), V. Charts and Miscellaneous (charts, designer's notes, and an excellent bibliography for further research.)<br />If you enjoy the Soldier's Companion, then you will also want to obtain Conklin's Atlas of the Worlds, which gives maps and facts about all the geography, flora, fauna, civilizations, and colonial possessions on Mars, Venus, Mercury, and Luna.ain Conklin's Atlas of the Worlds, which gives maps and facts about all the geography, flora, fauna, civilizations, and colonial possessions on Mars, Venus, Mercury, and Luna.	2004-01-23

It is more than just maps, for it is an encyclopedic compilation of geographic and historical knowledge. Of course the world and state maps are also there- and quite detailed and well drawn. However, it is the multitude of specialized maps and charts that really set this reference apart from other atlases.<br />The content includes: Gazetteer of the World, Gazetteer of the United States (listings of cities and their populations- and the map to locate them on), World Distribution Maps (pressure and winds, ocean currents, vegetation regions, climates, population density, occupations, languages, religions), World Statistics (earth and solar system, oceans and seas, lakes and inland seas, great ship canals, principle islands, principle islands, longest rivers), World Distance Tables, Color Map Section (World, Canadian, and United States), Political and Economic Tables of the World, Self-Sufficiency Tables, World Resource Production Maps, Ice Ages and Glaciations, The Geologic Record, etc. The World History Section alone contains many maps on ancient, medieval, and modern history, as well as, detailed maps on United States and Canadian History, World War I &amp; II, and voyages of discovery and exploration.<br />This is the sort of high quality atlas that you will not only use for specific reference for years to come, but you'll also find yourself pulling down just to browse and increase of strengthen your general knowledge.<br />The cover is simulated leather with gilt lettering.	2004-01-23

Of course you have to suspend belief in certain scientific and geographical principles to enjoy them, but you are more than rewarded by the nonstop action and high adventure. If you ever yearned to explore a strange new world of marvels and monsters, then this is the series for you.<br />This particular collection republishes three of the seven volumes in the series- including _At the Earth's Core_ which was the first. Pellucidar, in case you are new, is a subterranian world on the inner surface of the earth's crust. This world can be accessed by either drilling through the the crust or by natural openings at the poles. Burroughs inhabited this world with a rich variety of marvels almost around ever corner. These stories are a nonstop collection of survival, exploration, and empire building in strange and savage lands.<br />If you enjoy this collection then you'll also want to track down _Tarzan at the Earth's Core_ where ERB  sends his greatest character into his greatest setting.<br />These books are especially good for escaping from the dissappointments and frustrations of daily life.

That is because, as the introduction points out, the Native American tradition was primarly a verbal one. This is magnificent, poetic, oratory and needs to be read aloud.

Of course if you have read the Leaves, it is a nice bit of review and recollection. The cosmic consciousness of our greatest transidentalist poet shines through in it's strength, naturalness, and purity. This is not weak and delicate stuff.<br />There are fairly long interludes of nature sounds (bird song, insects, frogs, and running water and waves) and gentle guitar music between the poems, which gives the listener time to get into a receptive frame of mind, and to reflect on what was just heard. The reader, Lyn Dalebout, has a pleasant and expressive reading voice.

While the basic mechanics of meditation technique are covered, the real substance of the book is the devotional passages that are to be focused on. One doesn't merely read through the text in one sitting. These are individual passages that are intended for focused concentration and prayer one at a time. You meditate, dwell on, and feel them. Some of the language may seem a bit flowery at times, but if you focus on the meaning being expressed, then you realize that every single entry contains its measure of spiritual truth.<br />It should be noted that Yogananda makes repeated reference to Christ in the highest cosmic sense.

I was not disappointed.<br />I can't recall a better examination of the topic of prayer, and exactly what it is and how to practice it. The approach is not the convential fuzzy and pious one, for as the author states, there ought to be another word that we can use for prayer, since misuse has given it such a negative connotation.<br />What is prayer? It is stated that it is a yearning of the heart arising from either suffering or love. Whenever we think strongly about a subject we are \\"praying.\\" The process spelled out is Thought, Intention, and Surrender.<br />The book examines prayer across history and across cultures. She even brings in the findings of modern science (including the fact that our concentrated thoughts in the present appear to be able to reach back and influence the past....)<br />Perhaps the most valuable portion of the book deals with how NOT to pray. This can be summed up as: 1) no lip-service prayers (if you don't really MEAN what you are saying, or not concentrating on the meaning), 2) no show-off prayers (prayers to impress or shame others), 3) no harmful prayers (no calling down vengeance or harm on others), and 4) no prayers of worry or doubt (prayer should be positive- and in perfect faith.) I know that I have verified all of these principles in my own life over the years.<br />As a youth I used to think that prayer was a waste of time. Now I know that it is probably the most meaningful of human activities- all else is secondary to seeking connection to the Divine, however fleeting.	2004-01-18

He also used cameras with special film, tape recorders, and other instruments at the sites to see if there were any residual record able effects. While he had a certain amount of psychic sensitivity himself, he usually brought along another confirmed psychic to independently confirm the feelings of both himself and the original observers. In this particular volume the famous psychic and white witch, Sybil Leek, accompanied him.<br />This book is based on two prolonged trips the author took to Ireland in 1965 and 1966. He found that there had been surprisingly little written about Irish ghosts up to that time, and no real serious research attempt. Accompanied by his wife (an artist that provided numerous sketches of the various sites for the book), and Sybil Leek, he criss-crossed the island. Indeed, he saw so much of Ireland that this book has secondary value as a travel guide. He followed up any and all leads that he could find from urban Dublin to the most remote regions of the western coast. The sites themselves range from farm houses to castles, and from tenements to Tara.<br />Holzer has a light, humorous, conversational style that makes his book a joy to read. You actually feel that you are accompanying his expeditions as he goes.	2004-01-16

Even if this little book was totally without illustration it would be a compelling read, but combined with the many, many well chosen full color illustrations it is a true illustrated, spiritual, work of art.<br />The topic is covered in six well-organized sections: 1) What is Heaven Like? 2) The Inhabitants of Heaven, 3) Getting into Heaven, 4) Ancient Heavens, 5) Modern Heavens, and 6) Beyond Heaven. The entire range of human thought on these matters down through human history is examined with an open mind. Surprisingly, at their deepest level, there is much fundamental agreement between the major traditional views of heaven and an afterlife between cultures. Even the concept of the near death experience (NDE) is discussed in terms of what it may tell us of an afterlife. An example of the completeness of the study is the fact that the materialist/scientific dismissal of God and heaven is also examined.<br />The section on ancient heavens alone contains individual chapters on the Nordic and Celtic, Egyptian, Classical Greek, Asian, and Aboriginal afterlives. It is significant that all nearly primal peoples held that death was a spiritual initiation leading to rebirth in another world. We pass from this world of darkness into the other real world of light.	2004-01-15

It is often dismissed as an absurd cult of exaggerated manners- and an equally absurd obsession with romantic love. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Chivalry was the result of mankind's spirit rising from the barbarism of the Dark Ages. Chivalry was the recognition that men did not have to live as animals. Instead of might being used solely in the pursuit of plunder and power, came the ideal that the duty of the mighty was to defend the weak and oppressed. It was the recognition that women were not mere chattel to be used at will, but were the living embodiment of the eternal feminine ideal. The entire age was the triumph of idealism over a hard, bloody, barbaric world. Rules of honorable conduct were brought to warfare. Indeed, all of society was brought to a hierarchical order patterned after the kingdom of heaven. Everything had its rightful place in a divinely inspired order. Everything was holy and deserving of respect. All men had an honorable place in the world, and duty flowed both from the top down, as well as, from the bottom up. Even the tournament was far more than merely a contest of physical prowess- it was based in the unshakable conviction that no knight who was false could triumph in single combat over one who was true.<br />This book is an excellent examination both the ideal, as well as the reality, of the Age of Chivalry. It is divided into the following sections: the introduction  (by Oxford Fellow Jeremy Cato), The Origins of Chivalry, The Art of Courtly Love, and Chivalry in the Late Middle Ages. The many full-color illustrations are beautiful and jewel-like. The overall effect is that of a hand illustrated medieval book. This is a high quality hard cover. There is an attractive, colorful dust jacket. It should be noted that if you remove the jacket, the cover is illustrated with the seal of the Knights Templar.<br />This would make an excellent gift book for the idealistic and impressionable. As the book points out, the message of chivalry is somehow irresistible, an ever-receding horizon of hope that survives all the wars and other disasters that mankind has suffered through the centuries. It is a message of nobility of purpose, of respect and compassion for others, and of courage in the face of danger.the idealistic and impressionable.

This was inspite of the fact that I had followed the former all of my life, and the latter for 15 years of so in both the U.S. distibuted comic books and the original Eagle publications from England.<br />It took Batman being tranported to the Cursed Earth in pursuit of Judge Death to make me see the difference. Batman is the living soul of Justice. He will take Justice over Law every time, even if it means fighting cops. Judge Dredd on the other hand is a living law book. To him the Batman is just a vigilante, another law breaker. It doesn't even occur to him that they might be on the same side. Dredd is just a machine- Batman truly is the Dark Knight....<br />The scene where Batman smashes Dreddd in the face with all his might while shouting, &quot; YOU CALL THAT JUSTICE?&quot;, puts everything in perspective.<br />As a result of reading this book I have even more respect for Batman/Bruce Wayne- but much less for Judge Dredd.	2004-01-10

It works on every level. First of all, the premise of a world where the Eastern and Western Roman Empire never split (because of a common, supernatural enemy) is fascinating. For that is what happened when the East and West were on the brink of schism in the 4th century- the Evil suddenly appeared and turned a former north eastern province into the Empty Lands. For centuries the legions fought a wavering battle with the hoards of the non human (ogres, trolls, goblins, harpies, dragons, banshees, fairies, gnomes, etc.) For over 1600 years the conflict endured between Empire and Evil with no clear victor. And while the Empty Lands lay occupied neither the barbarians of north or east could threaten Rome....<br />That is the world of the hero of the tale, Charles Harcourt, scion of a great house that has stood on the marches of the empty lands for centuries. One day Charles's long lost uncle staggers in from the Empty lands with news of a sacred relic- and of Charles's long lost love. From this point starts a classic tale of the hero's quest into a supernatural realm to win a boon for humankind against the Darkness, and to rescue a maiden from the heart of hell itself.<br />What makes this tale particularly enjoyable is Simak's nod to H.P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu mythos with his incorporation of the Elder Ones.	2004-01-08

It gives out more of the impression of an illuminated manuscript. Every panel is an impressionistic painting. Every single word is actually written in calligraphic script. There are even large illuminated capitals in the corners of most pages. As for the story line, it goes far, far beyond simple entertainment for its own sake. This is a masterpiece.<br />The story takes place in the high Himalayas, twenty years after Dr. Stephen Strange left them to return to the world. Twenty years after the bitter, spiteful, avaricious animal that he once was, was reforged by the Ancient One into this world's Sorcerer Supreme. For as the Doctor acknowledges, the Ancient One saved him by turning an animal into a man, and a man into perfection's image and agent. Now, years after the Master has passed from this plane to become one with All-That-Is, the student returns to his temple to do honor to his memory.<br />The Doctor finds a surprise upon his return, for the master has left a final gift for his student. He takes the gift home to his Sanctum in Greenwich Village to decipher its meaning. Using all of his formitable knowledge and power he tries to discover the secret of the artifact. He almost fails in this until at the last moment of rage and despair a gateway into a new realm of Being was opened to him once again. He discovers once again that God is also a Magician, reality is his trick, and behind every trick is always another higher Reality. It just so happens that this higher reality is the realm of the Lords of Shamballa- and they have need of the good Doctor to bring transformation to the world- at a seemingly terrible price.<br />Reality has more skins than a snake: each skin a new truth, each truth a new illusion. And even a Sorcerer Supreme must be periodically reminded that this world is an illusion, time is an illusion, and the illusion can be transcended!	2004-01-05

The authors demonstrated that there are a large number of \\"uncounted\\" unemployed workers in American society. Indeed, the true unemployment figures may easily be double the official figures- or higher. The main difficulty lies in the fact that the government simply doesn't count anyone as \\"unemployed\\" who has either run out his allotted unemployment benefits, or did not officially qualify in the first place due to gaping loopholes in the system.<br /><br />The authors also examined the huge number of underemployed people who qualify as \\"employed\\" but who are barely earning a subsistence living (usually after losing much higher paying manufacturing jobs.) The actual standard of living of those forced off of the welfare roles and into marginal, low paying employment (often short lived) was similarly covered. The related phenomenon of the \\"feminization\\" of unemployment is identified and examined. Moreover, the idea that older workers were voluntarily leaving the workforce (instead of being forced out due to age discrimination) was also debunked.<br /><br />Anyone interested in, or outraged by, the massive redistribution of wealth in U.S. society over the last two decades, along with political efforts to cover up the fact, will find this study an excellent starting point. It would seem that neither major party really wants the peonization of American society to be closely and objectively examined or addressed.<br /><br />Table of Contents<br />-- Background<br />-- The Discouraged Worker Problem<br />-- The Existing Knowledge Base<br />-- Toward a New Perspective<br />-- Paths to Discouragement<br />-- Profiles in Discouragement<br />-- Coping Without Work<br />-- Viewing Life and Work<br />-- Seeking Work<br />-- Public Policy<br />-- What Are Their Needs?<br />-- How Should They Be Helped?<br />-- Bibliography<br />-- Index	2004-01-03

When time came for me to drastically weed out my library, this was the only book on the subject that I kept. It is a scholarly treatment, but not a mathematical one.<br /> The chapter structure is as follows: 1. Introduction to Geomorphology, 2. Weathering and Mass Wasting, 3. Stream Growth and Valley Development, 4. The Development of Stream Eroded Landscapes, 5. Geomorphic Systems- Theory and Philosophy, 6. Glaciers and Glaciated Landscapes, 7. Wind, Waves, Ground Water, and Volcanism.<br />All subjects are excellently illustrated by full page portions of actual topographic maps, as well as, crisp cross-sections and diagrams.<br /> This one volume seems to cover just about all the basics of the field. Anything in more depth would probably have to be more of a mathematical/engineering approach. As it is, this slim volume gives a comprehensive appreciation of the structures and processes that form our dynamic, intelligent, planet.<br /> Indeed, not only will you understand the processes that mold the landscape anywhere on earth, but these same principles have been shown to be applicable in the field of planetary geology.	2004-01-02

It comes with both a colorful jacket, as well as, an embossed yellow cloth hard cover with the title stamped in metallic blue letters. For an economy edition, this is an excellent effort- perfect for your permanent collection.<br />All the standard characters are here from Dorothy, Toto, Scarecrow, Tin man, Lion, Wizard, Glinda, Wizard, etc. In addition, you are introduced to some of the lesser-known classic characters such as Ozma, Jinjur, the Woggle Bug, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Sawhorse, and the Gump.<br />You can read these stories on many levels. They are not just for children. Most people forget, or never knew, that Baum originally intended it as a political satire (like Carroll's Alice books.) Dorothy is Everyman (or Everywoman) with her simple commonsense wisdom and goodness. The Cowardly Lion was William Jennings Bryant, the populist Presidential candidate who lost to the Republicans. The Scarecrow and the Tinman represented the union between farmers and industrial workers. The Wicked Witch represented eastern corporations and banks. Don't worry if you never saw this- the original message had been lost by the time the movie was made in the late-30's.<br />Read these books- if they still speak to what is good and gentle in your soul, then the real America isn't totally gone....	2003-12-28

All the classic teaching imagery is here: the city of destruction, slough of despond, village of morality, wicket gate, interpreter's house, the cross, palace beautiful, valley of the shadow of death, valley of humiliation, vanity fair, doubting castle, delectable mountains, dark river, and celestial city. Here too are the classic characters from the Evangelist, to Worldly Wiseman, to Faithful Friend. There is a modern updating to the characters and settings, but they are still faithful to the spirit of the original.<br />The remarkable thing about this tale is that it expresses eternal spiritual truths that you do not need to be a puritan, or even a christian, to appreciate.	2003-12-23

What if the eternal balance was determined by the never ending war between... sentient beavers and rats?<br /> This is the great and epic tale of the time beavers, the eternal guardians of the time streams. It is they who maintain and protect the Great Dam of Time. It is this cosmic structure, containing power objects from countless worlds and realities, that regulates the dimensional timestreams. Should the great dam fail, all would be swept away by the chaos that it holds in check. It is within this chaos that the rats thrived....<br />One dark day a party of sappers from the dimensions beyond the dam managed to penetrate the structure and steal three key artifacts. As strange as it may sound, all three artifacts came from an obscure little planet called earth. It is now up to to the legendary Timeguard to recover those artifacts before the great dam fails.<br />Yes, this is a &quot;funny animal&quot; comic book. However, this is the first funny animal comic book of epic and cosmic proportions!	2003-12-23

It was worth the wait. From the start I saw this as the modern equivalent of the work of William Blake (if Blake was alive today the graphic novel would be his natural medium.) It is obvious that this is a labor of love- she wrote, drew, inked, and lettered the whole thing herself. She bared alot of soul here. I just can't understand why there isn't more word of mouth on these books. It is clear to me that they are classics.<br />In the first volume young Lupe attempts suicide out of despair with the world. She finds herself in heaven, then hell. She meets her ex-guardian angel (apparently as much of a misfit as she is.) Oh yes, she also returns to life- meets two types of space aliens. She also encounters demons along the way. It is a rich, complex story (several interwoven stories actually) full of metaphor and deeper meaning. Yet, she also manages to interject humor at exactly the right moments. The narative is extremely sophisticated both in terms of theology and sociology. You certainly won't just whip through it- nor will you quickly forget it.<br />Specifically, part two takes over exactly whre part one left off. There is a chapter by chapter written synopsis of part one so that you can quickly catch up with the story. Lupe's guardian angel Arichel is back (my favorite character), as is the alien prophet, Shandan. Oh yes, Christ shows up just in time to wrap up the story with some satisfying explanations of the way of the world. Not only that, but two additional related stories, &quot;Goat&quot; and &quot;Mother Mountain&quot;, are included.<br />If you've only known Gregory's more humorous work, this epic graphic novel will surprise you. I look forward to the day when the rest of the world discovers it- and I can pull out my well-worn copies and say, &quot;I told you so&quot;....	2003-12-16

The symbols transcend both language and time. There is nothing contrived here. Such a tale could not be counterfeited by a modern mind.<br />At the center of the entire epic is Vainamoinen, the singer at the world's dawn. Here is the archetype for the wizard- the first and greatest among shamans. Before Merlin, before Taliesin, before Math, before Manannan, there was Vainamoinen, Eternal Seer.<br />Something real and vital carries over even in translation. Reading this book on a cold winter's night you can taste the sea and smell the forest. You can identify with the characters even though they have godlike powers, because they also have trades that they live by (Vainamoinen is a boatbuilder, Ilmarinen a smith, Joukahainen builds his own crossbows, etc.) These Godlike beings lived simple lives close to the earth. And simple wisdom is powerful wisdom. Yet, there is also so much more of the old, deep legends and symbols buried in these lines. You can tell that they were preserved long after the long lines of singers had ceased to know their original meanings.<br />The ancient Finns beleived in the power of words, and the greater power of songs. There is still power here. Or as the epic says:<br />Words shall not be hid<br />nor spells be buried;<br />might shall not sink underground<br />though the mighty go.	2003-12-16

Personally, I consider this graphic novel to be the best thing to come out of Marvel Comics in the modern era. It is a morality play- and a very good one.<br /><br />The action takes place in Christ's Crown, a sleepy midwestern town. It is here that Blackheart, son of Mephisto, heir to the throne of hell is reborn on our plane. It is also here that he decides to both depose, and surpass, his father. His strategy is to tempt and corrupt the new breed of hero- those that walk the razor's edge between Light and Darkness in the service of justice.<br /><br />To do this he summons Ghost Rider, Wolverine, and Punisher to town. He does this with notes that promise them secret information on what they desire most. Unfortunately, for him, he has misjudged the men that he has summoned. When they all automatically reject his offer of unlimited power in the service of Darkness, Blackheart then resorts to corrupting the entire town to use against them. Here he makes one fatal mistake when abducts the one innocent, uncorrupted soul in town- and spills her blood while doing so. The heroes fight their way into the heart of Hell itself to rescue the little girl....<br /><br />As Ghost Rider states in the story: It doesn't matter if there is an edge, or if we occasinally cross it. As long as the innocent are protected, our cause is just.<br /><br />The 1991 edition is printed on first class paper in brilliant color. There is an excellent four-panel folding dioramic cover.	2003-12-16

This isn't some dry-as-dust scholarly monograph, but is instead practical, concise, and filled with photographs that are extremely hard to find elsewhere. The photos aren't just of finished ships, either; you have photos of the men actually building the vessels at all stages of construction from keel laying to launching. There is an especially good section on the step-by-step construction of a modern trawler.<br />The history of the local yards is covered from before the Civil War right up to the present day. The section on the WWII years is especially interesting (hundreds of vessels were built: sub chasers, frigates, rescue boats, landing craft, mine sweepers, cargo ships, work boats, etc.) This tradition of building fighting ships continued through the rest of the century with gunboats, aluminum patrol craft, mine warfare ships, LST's, amphibious landing craft, even exotic assault craft for the Navy Seals.<br />Of course, it is the working ships that have been the meat and potatoes of the yards and the maritime economy. Everything is covered from schooners and wood burning tugs to the great 1000-foot ore carriers. Over the years the various yards have produced everything from the finest ocean-going luxury yachts, oceanographic research ships, passenger vessels, ore carriers, heavy lift vessels, salvage ships, fire boats, dredges, ferries, tugs, fishing trawlers and tugs, barges, pushers, etc. Anything that could fit through the St. Lawrence Seaway (and some who could not) has been built here in this community- and still are.	2003-12-04

When it comes to the art of simplifying one's life it would be hard to find a better practical guide. I highly recommend it- not because I followed it to simplify my own life, but because I found that I had already discovered practically every one of the 100 entries on my own. It was almost uncanny that I had come to the same conclusions and techniques in my own quest towards simplicity (life review, discarding nonsupportive relationships, journal keeping, wisdom literature, listening to one's inner voice, reducing media exposure, discarding useless distractions, practice dieing, weekend retreats, etc., etc., etc.) Of course  the author lists Synchronicity as #10, so perhaps I shouldn't have been so surprised. It seems that the universe whispers the same hints to all of us, if we merely quiet down enough to hear.<br />This is not a trivial, hippy-dippy, New Age title. The author is a former business woman. While it is true that she refers to synchronicity, meditation, yoga, runes, and consulting a psychic, she does so not because it is the newest, hip, New Age fad, but rather because it represents an ancient, effective, wisdom.<br />One of the hundred suggestions listed is to take a year off from work and do nothing. This is sound advice- I grew immeasurably when I did this. Be cautioned, however, that the corporate world will never forgive you for this. If you try to re-enter the corporate structure this will be a permanent black mark on your work record. Of course, once you internalise the other 99 tips in the book you will probably never wish to return to the corporate hierarchy anyway....	2003-11-25

The full title of this book is _Five Hundred and Seven Mechanical Movements, Embracing All Those Which Are Most Important In Dynamics, Hydraulics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Steam Engines, Mill and other Gearing, Presses, Horology, and Miscellaneous Machinery: and including Many Movements Never Before Published and Several Which Have only Recently Come into Use. At least that was the full title of the seventeenth edition of 1893; the book itself dates back to 1868.<br />This book is a joy to browse though. It is a little gold mine of ideas for the mechanical designer. Yet, anyone with mechanical aptitude should enjoy it. The many crisp line drawings are presented with a minimum of explanation and no dimensioning. You see, it was assumed back in those days that a person with natural mechanical aptitude could look at a diagram, or a machine, and figure it out. Not only that, but it was assumed that once you had the idea, then you could work out all the details for yourself without having to be told everything down to the last screw size. While there is a descriptive paragraph indexed to every drawing, most of the time you don't really need it.<br />This book comes from an age when engineers and designers had to have the talent and the knowledge to use the mechanical principles of levers, linkages, cams, gears, etc. to produce a given motion- and to link together many such elegant little mechanisms to get a bigger job done- reliably. This isn't done much anymore. Now most machines are huge, cobbled-up, Rube Goldberg devices of pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, screw actuators, or servo motors- all interconnected by electronic controllers. The whole thing is controlled by software of even more dubious reliability.<br /> Up to the &quot;digital revolution&quot;, this book shows how it was always done- it's how I learned it. Of course, once upon a time, a mechanical designer actually had to understand machinery, and the basic principles of physics, and not just how to write code....e code....	2003-11-24

If you've ever worked in old fashion manufacturing then you'll identify with this book. It comes from a time when men with mechanical aptitude could do anything from scratch with a minimum of outside help. Everything in this little book is written with an eye towards specific applications in industry- this isn't empty theory. Indeed, this one book covers just about every practical mechanism needed to run just about any Victorian manufactory.<br /> The first part of the book covers the fundamentals of mechanical design and kinematics. This is done with only simple shop mathematics. Basic definitions and formulas are given. The elements of levers and linkages are covered. Gears and gear trains are covered next. Pulleys and belts are the next subject. This is followed by the windlass and capstan. Variable motion using unusual wheel and gear shapes, sliding linkages, Roemer's wheels, eccentric escapements, etc. is next. Intermittent and reciprocating motion by wheels, geneva mechanisms, mangle wheels and racks, crown wheels, etc. follows. Sliding motion via inclined plane, screw, wedge, and cam is the next area covered (with special emphasis upon the screw press.) Escapements and pendulums of the type used in clockwork mechanisms are next. The following section covers flywheels, centripetal governors, and safety valves. Part One finishes up with mechanisms for modifying or translating motion such as sun and planet wheels, levers of Lagarouse, spiral cams, swash plates, and both Watt's and White's parallel motions.<br />The second part of this book covers a multitude of machines used in manufacturing, construction, and domestic purposes. First come winches and cranes. Next follows pile engines, hand jacks, the patent excavator (steam shovel), railway uncoupling, and dredging machines.  Then a section of machine tools are covered (drilling machines, foot-lathes, punching machines, shears, and sawmills. Next is the smoke jack (a type of hot-air engine.) The common clock is then treated. The following section deals with hydraulic machines from suction pumps to presses. There is a good coverage next of water wheels and waterpower. Screw propellers for ships are then covered, as well as the water turbine. Motion of water in pipes and channels is next. The following section is a detailed examination of machine tools (engine lathes, planers, shapers, slotting machines, and shearing machines.) Textile machines for carding and spinning follow. Riveting machines for boilers and other large vessels are covered. Next we have extensive coverage of steam engines (including slide-valves, boilers, boiler feeders, and pressure gauges.) Then there is an entire chapter on the process and machinery of sugar refining. A full chapter on calculation of work and its hindrance by friction follows. Then comes a full chapter on pottery manufacture. Finally there is a concluding chapter on the theory and practice of metal cutting machinery (mostly lathes, shapers, and gear cutters- the horizontal universal milling machine does not seem to be covered or anticipated.)<br />All of these topics are illustrated with a multitude of crisp, sharp line drawings. You are not provided with specific dimensions since these are concept drawings- you where expected to be able to think for yourself when it came to implementation.

That would have been unfortunate, for this is the best reference on the meaning of planetary aspects and lunar nodes that I have found. Chart interpretation involving these features bears about as much relationship to simple \\"sun sign\\" astrology, as basic arithmetic bears to calculus.<br />  Aspects are the angular relationships between planets in a birth chart. Too many references barely give you more information on them than simply stating if they are \\"favorable\\" or \\"unfavorable.\\" Braha gives you extremely detailed and perceptive explanations of all the significant aspects (conjunctions, squares, trines, oppositions, sextiles) for all possible combinations of the inner planets. The outer planets are not covered because their effects occur over such long spans of time as to be generational and tending to impact society as a whole rather than individuals. He writes authoritatively in a Vedic style that comes across as pure, essential, and archetypical.<br /> The lunar nodes are the points where the orbit of the moon intersects the plane of the ecliptic in a chart. They are probably the single most important feature in a Western birth chart. The north node indicates a person's future, while the south reveals the past (previous incarnations.) Or put another way, the south is what we have already mastered in previous lives, while the north indicates what we are here to achieve. Interpretation for both sign and house location are given<br />  My only truly accurate standard for evaluating this book's interpretations was to compare it against my own chart and life. The results were uncannily accurate and went far beyond vague general suggestions. Having studied astrology professionally I am mightily impressed by Mr. Braha's work. He is truly the sort of great astrologer that he dedicates this book to. Perhaps this is because he practices both eastern and western traditions, and because he comes from a culture where the profession of astrologer is regarded as a very serious profession indeed.<br /> Oh yes, the full-page illustrations of Gustav Dore' are far more than just filler, for they fit the mood of the text exactly. There are several that I would like to tract down for framing.<br />  If you are a serious student of astrology this book will become your most valuable reference for fleshing out your interpretation of a chart.ion of astrologer is regarded as a very serious profession indeed.<br /> Oh yes, the full-page illustrations of Gustav Dore' are far more than just filler, for they fit the mood of the text exactly.

You see, this book is more than a mere dictionary of the terminology of the Sacred Science, it is a virtual one-volume encyclopedia covering in detail the processes, principles, and history of the craft. The twenty-one-page introduction alone is one of the best brief histories of the subject that I have seen. Haeffner is an excellent writer that obviously has true understanding and sympathy for his subject. This is not just another dry, hostile, academic historical survey.<br />  The material covered is exhaustive and comprehensive. The Gnostic and Hermetic roots of the western tradition are examined in detail. Of course, there is a thorough coverage of the golden age of the Art during the Renaissance. In addition, modern rediscovery and interpretation is also covered (chiefly through Jung's work.)  If this wasn't impressive enough, the author also delves into the Arabic, Indian, Tibetan, and Chinese traditions. Further interconnections are shown with the subjects of astrology, mythology, numerology, natural magic, and prophecy. Indeed, this volume can serve as a grand survey of all of metaphysics.<br />In reading this book you gain deeper respect of the value of gaining mystical insight into the divine secrets of nature through a rigorous course of study involving both laboratory experimentation and religious meditation. You realize that the physical universe is not a dead and meaningless place. You begin to see that all of nature contains profound spiritual and moral lessons put there by the creator. It isn't that modern, conventional science is incorrect; it is just that it makes a mistake in assuming that the lower physical aspect of nature is the totality of existence. It makes a mistake in refusing to recognize the inherent meaning existing in world. After all, Ashmole, both Bacons, Keplar, and even Newton knew this.<br />There is an extensive seven-page bibliography for further study.<br />My only criticisms of this volume are that while it has an attractive and artistic cover, it is otherwise bereft of illustration. A subject as heavy with symbolism as alchemy benefits greatly from visual examples. There is also the fact that the cheap grade of pulp paper is unworthy of such an otherwise fine volume, though I have noticed that this is a common problem with books printed in Britain.Bacons, Keplar, and even Newton knew this.<br />There is an extensive seven-page bibliography for further study.<br />My only criticisms of this volume are that while it has an attractive and artistic cover, it is otherwise bereft of illustration.

After the author's excellent _In the Shadow of the Shaman_ I am not surprised. Just the many well drawn and meaningful little line illustrations done by the author tells me that this was a labor of love and not simply something slapped together. Amber Wolf understands the Path. You see that on the first page when she states that a shaman is one who helps people in their dealings with other worlds. That's the core of it exactly.<br />In this book she manages to touch upon everything from the basics of Lakota wisdom (her orientation is primarily Native American- wolf clan), to power objects, power object ceremony, altered states of consciousness, shamanic healing, spirit walks, harmony with the universe, methods for entering the shamanic worlds, divination through elements of nature, etc. Just reading this isn't going to make you a shaman, but chances are, if you are drawn to this path it will clarify and validate what you've already experienced to varying degrees.<br />The only disagreement I have with the author's approach is that she suggests that the old shamanic paths of vision quest and of physical and psychic trauma are a thing of the past. She seems to think that anyone can cross the threshold through more gentle methods of communion with the universe. Maybe it is so. All I know is, that traditionally a price had to paid for the gift. After all, it is the shaman's way to be the wounded healer. It is in the ordeal of our hard won wounds, of even death and rebirth, that we bridge the worlds. There have been many gifted medicine people who have never undergone the Shaman's ordeal, but then they are medicine people and not true shamans.<br />Yet perhaps it is possible in these new times for everyone to attune with all the worlds in harmony with Spirit without undergoing the old trials. In any case, we agree on the goal- to be the bridge between worlds, to restore the balance, to serve as a living channel for the flow of subtle energies.as a living channel for the flow of subtle energies.	2003-11-16

That is because this is an attempt to express the totality of Moorcock's conception of the multiverse in graphic novel form. In other words, it describes not only our somewhat familiar universe, but also all possible universes. Not only that, but it describes them all, over the entire range of time, because as the author points out, all of time exists simultaneously. It is only human consciousness that organizes it in a linear or cyclic fashion. In fact, that is what the main protagonists of the story, the Chaos Engineers, do- they range the entire multiverse, upscale and downscale, in their living organic vessels. They do this in the service of complexity and diversity. They do this in opposition to their sworn eternal enemies the lords of sterile, dead, and static Order.<br />  Now, operating on the margins of this great eternal conflict between Chaos and Order are the Jugadors, who are the Great Players who play the multiverse as a game- or is it as an instrument? They maintain the great dynamic equilibrium between Order and Chaos. This is because one must never be allowed to totally triumph over the other- that would spell the end of the whole. It is the Balance, the perfect equilibrium, which is the ideal. Most of the sentient and nonsentient universe is rooted in this struggle. This includes a majority of Moorcock's major characters, from Elric to the Rose, to Begg, Von Bek, Keraquazian, Cornelius, Bastable, etc.<br />  This is not an easy story to follow. The logic is complex, but it is consistent. You almost have to be a metatemporal detective like Sir Seaton Beggs to follow it. Indeed, the principle artist makes an appearance in the story proclaiming that he doesn't understand the rules! That is what makes fiction like this so enjoyable- it is so utterly challenging in the way that Moorcock has thrown away all the rules of conventional fiction. It is a grand jazz riff of metaphysics of flow of consciousness- or higher consciousness. It is no wonder that this has been described as the crowning achievement of all the decades of his work.<br />  See you on the moonbeam roads....nsciousness- or higher consciousness.

The colours are especially magnificent. In the forward, Michael Moorcock expresses his surprise and delight that First Comics could adapt his work so faithfully to graphic form. Indeed, this volume is one of the best monuments to that now defunct Chicago publishing house.<br />Sailor on the Seas of Fate is actually the first tale of three in this volume. It takes place before the traditional start of the Elric mythos- before the destruction of the dreaming isle, Imrryr, and of his bride, Cymoril. In this story Elric flees pursuers from the Young Kingdoms only to find himself on the shores of the sea with no escape before or behind. He resolves that it is better to simply walk on into the waves than to give his enemies the satisfaction of his slaughter. Only the voice and the pull of the black rune blade, Stormbringer, at his hip draws him back to shore. Eric then resolves to simply sleep and await his inevitable fate- too weary to longer care. It is then that he is awakened by the looming shadow of a great ship. He hails the vessel only to find that it has been searching for him. He finds other passengers that seem oddly familiar. They seem to come from many places and many times. Some, like Erekose, Prince Corum, and Hawkmoon, seem to actually be a part of him in some strange way- like they share a common soul. The blind captain tells the passengers that they sail for mythical Tanelorn, the archetypical soul of all cities. Here the four shall be forged into one to save the universe itself from being consumed by a threat from Beyond.<br />The second tale takes place on the voyage back to Elric's home plane. He lands upon a strange shore where he falls in among pirates- and one future friend, Count Smiorgan Baldhead, sea lord of the Purple Towns. Elric and his new companion then encounter the legendary Melnibonian sorcerer, Saxif D'aan. D'aan is famed in the old tales as one of the few of his race to know the emotion of remorse- and how it drove him mad. It seems that Elric has been drawn to this place and time to help resolve and avenge the monstrous crime that drove the sorcerer to madness.<br />Finally, an adventurer that seeks a city even older than dreaming Imrryr rescues Elric and Count Smiorgan from the seas. They travel along of this quest only to find the secret of his own race's origin- and to the origin of the contest between Chaos and Order on this plane....<br />If you can still find a copy of this book then grab it.

There was once a U.S. government program that trained carefully selected personnel to transcend time and space; to view persons, places, or things remote in time and space; and to gather usable intelligence on the same. The name of this program was Stargate.<br />This account is written by a highly decorated regular army officer(Airborne Ranger Company Commander) who was a recruited to play a direct role as a remote viewer. He was seemingly an unusual candidate for this, having grown up in a career army family and the Mormon church. However, having experienced a head wound, and a resulting near death experience, he began to perceive the world around him in a way that shook his previous misconceptions about the nature of the universe. He even began to doubt his own sanity. Fortunately, in those days there were still a few brilliant and open minds connected with the government that recognised the existance and value of those with \\"special gifts.\\"<br />This book will give you an overview of the precedure used in the remote viewing process. It also gives a good survey of the types of missions that were attempted. There are several books that can do this acceptably. Morehouse gives insight into the moral and ethical element of the process. You see, he always knew of the higher struggle of Good and Evil in the world and never once lost sight of it (the world would have no purpose without choice between the two.) He shows that this is no doubt what ultimately lead to the demise of the program and the following smear campaign. You see, the CIA tried to take control of the program at the end and nothing \\"spooked\\" the \\"spooks\\" more than the idea that there might be angels looking over their shoulders. Indeed, the highest ranking intelligence officer in the the army is quoted, before witnesses, as saying that the CIA does nothing that doesn't primarily serve the Agency's own interests- and that they are the biggest assembly of liars and thieves in the country- and an \\"abomination.\\" These were the words of the army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence.<br />Whether or not you believe any of this is up to you. All I can say is that I have some small experience in these matters and this is the best written, most intelligent, account that I've read. It was a strong ring of truth to it and that is a hard thing to convincingly counterfeit.ion.\\" These were the words of the army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence.<br />Whether or not you believe any of this is up to you.

This book contains large, color, four-panel foldouts of 36 types of historical warships. These foldouts include a detailed cut-away view showing the interior layout of the vessel, additional descriptive views, sail plans (if applicable), actual photos (if the subject is still extant), and an excellent descriptive blurb. All details on the cut-away are numbered and indexed to a list of features. The historical range is from classical Rome to the modern age and includes primarily western warships. The ships described are as follows: Roman Trireme, Viking Longship, Royal Galley, Spanish Galleon, Vasa, Sovereign of the Seas, Victory, Santissima Trinidad, Constitution, Merrimac, Gloire, Warrior, Devastation, Andrea Doria, Maine, Holland VI, Guiseppi Garibaldi, Dreadnought, U9, Leonardo da Vinci, Queen Elizabeth, De Ruyter, Enterprise, Scharnhorst, Cossack, Tirpitz, Yamato, PT109, Iowa, Nautilus, Long Beach, Nimitz, Kirov, Ohio, Guiseppe Garbaldi, and Zeeleeuw. It is a good overall selection of vessels typical of their classes; ranging from surface ships of the line, lighter patrol vessels, carriers, and submarines.<br />I only have two small complaints. First of all, why did they choose to include the Merrimac (Virginia) and not the revolutionary Monitor? Also, the contribution of Italy seems to be a bit too heavily represented, but this may be because the book itself appears to have been produced in Italy.<br />This is a hard cover volume with an internal spiral binding.	2003-11-10

In fact, it is remarkable that so much information is packed into 50 pages. H-13 Sioux is the U.S. Army designation for the Bell Model 47, which first entered production in 1946. The Model 47 is the classic bubble canopied &quot;dragonfly&quot; that most people first began to associate with the word helicopter.<br />The text covers the beginnings of the 15 year development process by designer Arthur Young. It also covers the early prototypes built during WWII by the Bell Aircraft Company. Indeed, it appears that every model is covered from the first six cylinder Franklin power plant, to the super-turbocharged Vietnam era mills, to the final experiments with turbine power (the H-13 was the first helicopter to be fitted with a jet turbine). Not only does the text go into considerable detail, but there is a wealth of excellent illustrations from crisp black and white photos, to engineering grade line drawings, to full color painted side views showing most Army and Navy markings.<br />The emphasis in this book is with military variants that served with both U.S. and foriegn forces (RAF, Luftwaffe, Spain, Italy, Japan, and over 40 other national airforces.) Action in both Korea and Vietnam is covered in separate chapters. Observation, medivac, and gunship models are all covered in detail. It is especially interesting to see the evolution of the various armed models that were developed by the U.S. Army as they invented the equipment and tactics of the modern air cavalry arm. Indeed, the immediate predicessor to the Hueycobra gunships was a heavily modified H-13 designated the Model 207 Sioux Scout. Various special varients are also covered such as the Nasa astronaut training version and the Presidential tranports of the Eisenhower administration (the airforce had the duty back then.)<br />All-in-all this is a detail packed tribute to a fine old aerial work horse.horse.	2003-11-10

It is profound because it successfully challenges the accepted, modern view of &quot;reality.&quot;<br />This book is a continuation of the ideas explored in the author's previous masterpiece, _Daemonic Reality_. It examines the &quot;Otherworld&quot;, the Anima Mundi, or soul of the world. This is the larger Reality that was accepted by all traditional cultures, but which is now rejected, suppressed, and ignored by Western man. Yet, just because it is ignored doesn't mean that it doesn't exist- and doesn't make itself felt in our lives.<br />While _Daemonic Reality_ emphasized the modern phenomena that seem to represent &quot;break-outs&quot; from the otherworld (UFO's, crypto zoological species, Marian apparitions, angels, etc.), this volume goes into more historical and philosophical depth. It is a round about approach, but then it almost has to be for such a complex and unusual subject. Modern language and mindsets are simply inadequate for the purpose. Indeed, the book appropriately mirrors a hermetic labyrinth in its approach.<br />Yet debunking the hyper-rational and ultra-materialistic world of modern scientism isn't the foremost objective here. The author is primarily trying to give us some sense of the mind-set of traditional man, of a supernatural world that existed in close communion with the natural world and human society. Our western religious and scientific tradition has driven a wedge between us and both nature and heaven. This is an alien and unbalanced state for a person, or a society. This seems to be why the old immortal daemons periodically break through the veil into our false, shallow, consensus reality. They are trying to awaken us.<br />Yes, we are truly initiated by what we cannot control....	2003-10-31

Their content represents a kind of pre-war German metaphysical idealism that all but evaporated in later years. These lectures take place after the author had broken with the Theosophical Society to form his own movement (emphasizing more of a mystic Christianity than Buddhist and Vedic principles.)<br />Steiner held to a belief in a literal existence of vast realms inhabited by the soul and spirit in the interval between death and rebirth (which he estimated at approximately 1000 years in duration.) He held that we could communicate with the deceased in these realms by an adjustment of consciousness. Indeed, he held that we on earth can be a positive spiritual support for those that are journeying through those realms- and, in turn, they can aid and support those of us still in earthly incarnation.<br />Steiner held that after a human being passed through the portal of death; he becomes an evolving, expanding cosmic entity. He seemed to emphasize that not only do we continue to evolve spiritually after death, but also the amount that we can absorb in this state is dependent on our spiritual and moral development on earth. Once we had absorbed all we could in the cosmic realm, we would then contract, be reborn on earth, and start the whole evolutionary process over again- this time progressing a little farther than we did the last cycle.<br />Steiner was well known as the editor of Goethe's scientific work. Perhaps this is why he held that while materialist science is able to point to the external causes, it couldn't grasp the inner spiritual origin of things. Yet everything has a spiritual foundation. He held that if science has a legitimate task to discover the physical causes of happenings, then spiritual science has the task of supplying the spiritual causes to phenomena- without excluding the reality of outer physical causes.<br />One final note, while it is popular these days to link German mystical and occult thought with the Nazis, Steiner's thought was never perverted in such a manner. Steiner held that all human beings, regardless of race or national origin contained a divine spark. He held that his cosmic Christ had sown this spark in all peoples.lar these days to link German mystical and occult thought with the Nazis, Steiner's thought was never perverted in such a manner.

If you loved Forester's \\"Hornblower\\" series, as I did, then you will also appreciate Alexander Kent's \\"Richard Bolitho\\" tales. You do not get the sense that they are derivative of Forester's work, for they stand on their own original merit. The action flows nonstop and logically with hardly a calm or doldrum. The author clearly understands the complexities of handling and fighting a ship under sail. He doesn't just use nautical terminology and commands as colorful filler- he uses them accurately as a fundamental part of the narrative. In fact, as a secondary feature, these books are a decent primer on 18th century seamanship.<br /> As much as the author excels at technical accuracy, his character development and knowledge of human nature is even stronger. He shows that the politics, gameplaying, and back-stabbing aboard a warship can be every bit as complex as that in a Turkish harem. Yet, there is the underlying sense of the imperative of setting a positive example as an officer, of showing your people that you can truly LEAD as well as you can simply COMMAND their daily lives.<br /> In this volume Bolitho has been promoted to Commodore and given command of a squadron (three seventy-fours, a thirty-two gun frigate, and a sloop of war.) He takes command with orders to find out what Napoleon is up to in the Mediterrean- and then to handle it as best he sees fit. As the majority of the British fleet is tied up on blockade duty in the Atlantic, he will be the sole projection of British naval might this side of Gibraltar. The details of commanding an entire task force instead of a single vessel, as in the earlier volumes, is fascinating in and of itself. Ultimately, Bolitho finds that he must place his command between the Nile and an entire French fleet....	2003-10-24

It is instead a work of historical fiction, in which the Emperor is the foremost of a wide range of famous and eccentric characters drawn from real life (from Sam Clemens and William Tecumseh Sherman to Rufus Porter (inventor of the aerial locomotive) and Abe Warner (proprietor of the Cobweb Palace.)) It is also very good, especially for a first novel.<br />While the characters are presented as larger than life, they are not cartoonish. The character of Joshua Norton is especially painted with depth, or at least as much as such an enigma can be. Sure, most people today would write him off as a penniless bum, madman, con artist, or worse. There was much, much more to him, though. Invariably, those that knew him spoke of his dignity, moral strength, and kindness. If he were simply mad, in a city like San Francisco (then or now) he would hardly have merited a second glance. Yet for over 20 years he was accepted as Emperor. Newspapers printed his edicts, restaurants fed him for free, citizens accepted his currency, heads of state corresponded with him (Lincoln, Victoria, and the Tsar) - and over 10,000 turned out in pouring rain to attend his funeral at the Masonic Cemetery. Norton the First was respected, he was listened to, and his moral example was followed- there are many called \\"Emperor\\" that could not claim this much.<br />In addition, this book presents a colorful and detail filled picture of gold rush times in early California. The author has done his research. I was especially taken by how he got the details of placer mining correct. My only minor criticism would be his knowledge of firearms of the period- there are a few obvious inaccuracies there.<br />If you are looking for a formal biography, then try _Norton I, Emperor of the United States_ by William Drury. The author also lists it as his primary reference.	2003-10-22

Now, five volumes later, I am a devoted reader. This, volume five, was no exception. The excellent character development and magical atmosphere is strong as ever. These books are the perfect escape from the concerns of the day.<br />  Yet, Rowling has added a new element to this fifth book. Actually, it isn't new; it is more of a shift in emphasis. All of the previous books have contained valuable lessons about life, friendships, and the battle between light and darkness. This one, however, drives it home in a more mature manner. Many readers have called it \\"dark.\\" I suppose that it is dark in the sense that it shows that good and noble institutions can be infiltrated and corrupted. A lot of people do not want to admit that possibility- especially to impressionable young readers. You see, characters like Cornelius Fudge and Professor Umbridge are all too common in the real world. They use once useful and beneficial organizations to gain their own selfish and twisted ends. It is the fortunate student who learns this lesson early while they are still in school and before they are blindsided by it in the outside world.<br />Yet, in spite of this darkness, or maybe because of it, an important lesson is taught. The lesson is this- when the system is corrupt, you can resist. You can form an underground resistance and fight it, if you know in your heart of hearts that you are on the side of justice, right, and good. No wonder more than a few schools, churches, and parents have a problem with these books, and this book in particular....<br />But perhaps far more frightening is the prospect that there may be something dark and unrecognized in yourself.

Once upon a time would-be Wiccans were told,  \\"Only a witch can make a witch.\\" Cunningham cut through all of that (and took a lot of flak for doing so.) He emphasized that Wicca, like all true religions worthy of the name, are between the practitioner and the Deity- with no need of a high priestess or priest as a \\"gate keeper.\\" You see, Cunningham was among the first to see the connection between Wicca and Shamanism (the first and most individualistic of spiritual paths), as he points out in the very first chapter.<br />  You will find everything here that you need for effective natural spiritual practice, for make no mistake- that is what true Wicca is. The first section of the book is largely informative and theoretical. The Deities are covered, both Goddess and God, in their various historical variations. The nature of magic as the projection of natural energies is then examined. Following this, the various magical tools as symbolic foci for concentration are covered (from Atheme to wand.) Next, the importance of music, dance, and gesture in establishing ritual consciousness is dealt with. Following is the significance of ritual and preparation for ritual (if you are not centered in the proper frame of mind, then all the ritual in the world is not going to do you any good.) The importance of setting up a ritual space, the magic circle and altar, and its meaning and symbolism is explained. Then comes a discussion of the Sabbats and the natural cycle of seasons and their respective energies and lessons. This discussion of natural cycles leads naturally to an examination of the spiral of rebirth (reincarnation.)  Finally, the question of initiation is discussed (true initiation is not performed by one human upon another.)<br />  The second section moves on to practice, as opposed to strictly intellectual study. Here you learn the sound basics of actual magical techniques (breathing, meditation, visualization, and channeling energy.) Next comes self-dedication (very similar to right-mindfulness in the Buddhist path.) Finally comes all the steps to ritual design (purification of self, of space, creating sacred space, invocation, ritual observance, energy raising, earthing the power, thanking the Gods, and breaking the circle.) No matter what spiritual path that you may later choose to follow, these are foundations that will carry over and serve you well.<br />  Finally, in the third section, is a complete Book of Shadows (a highly personal individual book of rituals, spells, and magical lore) that you may use as is, or use as a model upon which to pattern your own.<br />  In the back you have a full glossary of all the specialized terms used in the text. There is also an excellent bibliography of books for further specialized study, as well as, a full index.

Will Halloway is Douglas Spaulding is...young Ray Bradbury. However, where _Dandelion Wine_ dwells primarily on the innocent and uncorrupted side of small-town America in its golden age, this volume dwells with its shadow side. You see, Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show doesn't bring darkness to town, so much as it cultivates what's already there. Like all portrayers of vice, if there weren't already a potentially willing market, they would have no success.<br />  Yet, every generation the black train steams into town- always on the cusp of the seasons- always in a long October, half way between midsummer and Christmas. Every generation they tempt and entrap. Every generation must either resist or succumb to their dark tricks. These October people are still out there, still making their infernal rounds....<br />  This book bears rereading. First of all, like much of Bradbury's earlier work it is as much poem as prose. I know that I myself didn't really appreciate poetry, the right brain side of seeing things, until I found his work. Also, as one grows older, one identifies less with Will, and Will's potential shadow, Jim, and more with the other characters. For me, Will's father, an old man who has wandered the world and has suffered a thousand petty defeats- and a much lesser number of minor victories- becomes more and more familiar.<br />  This book will give you nightmares. It will do so not because of graphic violence, but because of the way it subtly undermines the spirit and spreads doubts through the chinks of the soul. Still, without Dark to contend with, how would Light define, and strengthen, itself?	2003-10-08

To the symbolist, there is inherent meaning to the cosmos. This meaning exists on many levels in an intricately interconnected web of correspondences. In this book, the great meaningful and predictable cycles of time are examined in light of astrology, synchronicity, and mythology. These tools are shown to provide the keys for connecting the cosmic to the contemporary.<br />  Once one verifies the validity of the symbolist view for one's self (and synchronistic verification starts to present itself to your conscious mind) one never sees the world in the same way again. For instance, current events such as Mars historic proximity, wars and blood shed in the Near East, and the break up of a space shuttle over Texas all start to fall into a meaningful pattern.<br />  The common thread through this book is the nature of the dawning Aquarian age. It is pointed out that there are both positive and negative aspects to Aquarian energies- and it is as yet far from certain as to which will prevail.<br />  This book is a worthy successor to the author's The Waking Dream.	2003-10-04

In addition, the two indexes in the back cross-reference the entries by nationality and type of vessel.<br /><br />_Each entry gives you vessel type, displacement, dimensions (English and Metric), machinery (engines), top speed, Launch date, main armament and armor (if any.)

In fact, this county once had more lighthouses than any other in the country. This little book tells their tale and that of the men who kept the sacred trust of keeping those lights burning.<br />  But, this book is also much more. It is an excellent introduction to the history of the peninsula from earliest European discovery, to the settlement of the Old North West, to the industrial boom days, to the modern day. Separate chapters are devoted to famous lighthouses in world history, as well as, the history of American lighthouses and the Lighthouse Service. There is also an excellent chapter on the history of shipping on the lakes with descriptions and illustrations of the types of vessels involved in hauling timber, stone, iron ore, passengers, and in fishing.<br /><br /> Virtually every surviving lighthouse is covered in this book with detailed data on location, access for viewing, history, construction and design, height of tower and of light above water level, and current ownership and administration. Excellent line drawings of the towers and associated buildings are provided (the architectural complexity and variation is remarkable.)<br />  A section describing the current maritime museums, as well as functioning shipyards that offer tours, in the area is included in the back.<br />Note:  \\"Range lights\\" are a set of lights that are lined up to indicate a safe channel (usually a taller aligned with a shorter beacon.)	2003-10-04

An American expatriate living at a Buddhist monastery in Taiwan takes advantage of the lifting of travel restrictions to see if China's legendary tradition of hermits still endures. He arrives in 1989, during the student demonstrations in Tienanmen Square. The officials assure him that the decadent hermits have been completely wiped out long ago. In spite of this, the scholar presses inland to the heart of China. He finds himself drawn to the Chungnan mountains- the mighty spine of the dragon, the bones of China itself, dividing the Yangtze country in the south from the Yellow river country to the north. He doesn't realize that this is where shamanism first arose in China, if not in the human world. This was where the Immortals lived. This was where Lao-tzu wrote the Tao te Ching. Here, he finds his hermits, Buddhist and Taoist, young and old, male and female. I think that the best part in the entire book was when one ancient hermit, who had been living in the mountains since 1939, asked the author, \\"Who is this \\"Mao\\" that you speak of?\\"<br /> After his initial contact with Chungnan hermits (he would return) the author heads back down into modern China. He finds that the Tienanmen Massacre has occurred.<br /> Upon reading this book I got a sense that the true bones of China were untouched by Communism, as they will no doubt be left untouched by Corporatism. I found this book to be inspiring- you could not invent a piece of fiction this good. However, I also found myself wishing that the author had brought that ancient hermit back with him to face down the butchers of Tienanmen.<br /> One man centered in the Tao can do much....	2003-09-17

I never really appreciated &quot;weeds&quot; before I bought this little book. You see, I didn't really buy it for practical identification purposes. I bought it out of idle curiousity and a need to kill time. This was because I was working a job in an isolated and overgrown industrial park and identifying the plants that were overgrowing the complex seemed to be both distracting and contructive.<br />In a very short period of time I was able to identify every plant, flowering and nonflowering. The illustrations show the flowers, the leaves, the seeds, and often the form of the entire plant above ground. Plus, the concise text gives pertinent facts about the plants' properties, habits, history, and range. In fact, a small range map of the United States is included for every single species. Since the book contains only about 130 major species (all you will probably ever need) it is fast and easy to flip through for identification. There are two notable omissions in the text however- Kudzu and Cannabis....<br />One thing that really stuck with me after using this book is how many of our most common plants actually came from abroad- early Indians would have had no idea what they were!	2003-09-17

In my case, it was this perceptive and extremely well written study of hermits, solitaries, and recluses. It is not often in our modern world that the possibility, and legitimacy, of a solitary existance is examined in a sympathetic manner.<br /> I do not think that I've seen a more comprehensive study of the phenomenon of the solitary lifestyle (Chinese and Tibetan hermits, the desert fathers, medieval anchorites, monastic and hermit religious orders, wandering holy men from Ireland to Russia, shamans, the pastoral posers of the 18th century, American mountain men, the New England transidentalists, eccentric noblemen, classical Stoics, Romantic poets, conservationists- even Howard Hughs!)<br /> Clearly, this is a topic that resonates with the author too, but then as a writer that would seem only natural (i.e., she is a member of what has traditionally been considered the solitary profession.) She clearly understands the various motivations that come to drive individuals to a solitary existance, both voluntarily and involuntarily (love of nature, inspiration, world weariness, high sensitivity, preservation of the poetic ego, scopophobia, religious dedication, and the desire to find union with the Divine itself....)	2003-09-16

It fit my mood perfectly (i.e., gaily mournful.) In fact I found myself looking up from the pages and paraphrasing the author himself, \\"If this isn't nice, then what is?\\" Perhaps this is because I've always identified more with Vonnegut and his generation than my own. I understand the sense of mourning and absurdity that he gets from our brave new corporate world.<br />Vonnegut revisits so many of his old characters and themes in this book. It is a fitting reunion for a last novel. Most notable is the reintroduction of Kilgore Trout. Trout becomes a global hero, loved by all, before he dies. Perhaps then, there is hope for us all. You also find such familiar themes as the need for extended families (artificial or otherwise.) Also, that perhaps people should treat each other a little nicer and help each other get through this mess- whatever it is. And that maybe socialism isn?t such a bad word- and Eugene Debs deserves to be honored as an American Hero. As a matter of fact the author proposes four new humanist amendments to the constitution that I would ratify in a New York minute.<br />As for his concept of a Time Quake (people consciously reliving their lives without the ability to change anything, but only observe) well, some say that is what happens when we all pass over. We get to observe all of those mistakes, and then return a little wiser in an attempt to do better next time. Or maybe that?s just a work of fiction, too. I think not. Perhaps, his character, Dr. Fleon Sunoco, the mad scientist, was right about little radios in the brains of genius's picking up bright ideas from somewhere else....<br />Ting-a-ling!	2003-09-11

I find myself wondering why I waited so long to finally get to it. If Gore Vidal had written nothing else in his life, this volume would have been enough.<br />It was the religious aspect of the novel that most interested me. This book addresses issues that are still quite controversial about the early days of the Christian Church in the Roman world. It's \\"triumph\\" over Hellenism was far more complicated and messier than most people realize. Indeed, Julian, as the last great champion of the old Gods (or rather the one ultimate God of Plato with His many aspects) comes across as the most spiritually sincere character in the book. It is refreshing to follow the thoughts of a sincerely good man whose only motivation for most of his life was to lead a good life in pursuit of Truth. Even when the titles of \\"Caesar\\" and then \\"Augustus\\", are forced upon him by men who realize his goodness, his first thought is always the welfare of those he now rules and never his own glory and power. Here, is one of the very few times the ideal of the Philosopher King was ever realized in the flesh.<br /> One comes to realize, through the words of the Emperor and his biographers, the true nature and value of both classical philosophy (love of wisdom) in it's many aspects, as well as the equal importance of mysticism, magic, and the Mysteries in the Roman world.<br />  You also see how the myth of the good Emperor who once saved the West, and who will one day return, far predates the time of Charlemagne, or even Arthur.<br />Vidal has captured the transitional, turbulent world of the 4th century C.E. better than any other writer. You feel the corruption, greed, and decay that would ultimately spell the end of the empire in the next century. You find yourself mourning for the lost power and virtue that was once Rome's. It is obvious that Vidal has actually read Plato, Homer, Aurelius, Plotinus- unlike so many other writers that try to exploit this time period. Vidal understands the twilight of the empire; he understands what was lost- and why.<br />It can be somewhat eerie reading the accounts of Julian's legions advancing through Mesopotamia. The accounts of his troops entering the opulent deserted palaces of the Great King, the relatively easy initial victories and defeat of the enemy army, the resulting constant hit-and-run warfare, the atrocities and cruelty of the enemy, the treacherous civilians, the miserable intense heat, the lack of support from home, the grumbling of the troops themselves, even the burning naphtha pools- you realise that all of this has happened before. Even Julian sees that it had happened over and over before his own time. It is proof of Aurelius' eternal cycles.other writers that try to exploit this time period.

If one has the left brain traits necessary to grasp the transfinite logic and mathematics, then the mystical implications are ungraspable. And if you have the right brain intuition to understand the mystical implications, then you often struggle with the logic and mathematics. This book requires a reader with not only a first rate mind, but also a balanced one.<br />To briefly abstract the primary thesis: time is really motion in extra dimensional space. This is profound, for Ouspensky was the first to actually point towards where an actual, physical fourth dimension can be found. Our brains confuse this dimension with time. It can be split off from time with an adjustment, or evolution, of consciousness. You see, this represents the next huge leap in understanding the nature of the universe and reality. Just as Newton's undefined quantity of \\"gravity\\" was shown to actually be curved space, so does Ouspensky show Einstein's undefined quantity of \\"time\\" to be motion through higher physical dimensions.<br />If you want a book that will challenge you, this is it.

The hero of this epic is given the choice, just before a great war, whether to take the offer of a mighty army- or to choose a single charioteer. Of course, that charioteer is Krishna (the avatar of the god Vishnu on earth.) Krishna will not be able to intervene supernaturally in the conflict, but only offer teaching and advice. The hero, Arjuna, chooses Krishna and his advice over the mighty army, for he knows that to be in accord with God's will is all that truly matters. Besides, he also realises that Vishnu only incarnates on our plane of existence when things have deteriorated far out of control and it is time for Him to once again restore peace, justice, and harmony to the world. In other words, he KNOWS that he will be on the side of God, for God will literally be at his side.<br />This text represents the teachings that Krishna imparts to the hero, Arjuna. It is a message of how to put one's self and soul into accord, and in doing so, put one's self into mystic union with the divine. It is a message that one should do one's duty in the world without becoming too attached to one's actions or rewards (to be in the world but not of it.) It is also an assurance that the body is merely the body- to lose it is not to cease to exist. It is also a declaration that doing right for the sake of right is far more important that observing rigid rules and rituals of religious conduct.<br />This text is the excellent verse translation of Sir Edwin Arnold (1832-1904.) The Sanscrit terminology is all explained either in the forward, in footnotes, or immediately in the poetical, but highly comprehendable, text. I am not sure why this particular volume is listed as \\"abridged\\" for it is not.

Before Ueshiba experienced his three enlightening visions he was already one of the greatest martial artists in history, after the visions he became a force of nature....<br /><br />Central to these deceptively simple teachings is the principle of becoming one with heaven and earth. Where heaven and earth meet is the center of the cosmos. When your center also corresponds with this place, then you are undefeatable.<br /><br />While Aikado is truly the way of the warrior, the definition of warrior has been restored to its cosmic meaning. A warrior strives to restore harmony and balance to the world. A warrior puts things right in accordance with the Way of Heaven.<br /><br />You will not find a great deal of specific techniques in this book. As the master states, one should not depend too much on the mastery of specific techniques. Nor should one focus too much on any specific aspect of an opponent, neither his eyes, his sword, his tricks. Instead one should reach out and encompass the entire opponent within the sphere of your being. You should flow with him, engulf him. Meet fire with water.<br /><br /> On the other hand, there is no substitute for practice, practice, practice. This is what attunes our body with the Ki. This is what forges a body like iron is forged into steel.<br /><br />Unlike classic martial texts such as _The Art of War_, this book will be of limited appeal to the materialist. Ueshiba makes it clear that he rejects materialism. He rejects bondage to things. You are to forget your little self and detach from objects. He rejects unnatural imbalances in the world of any kind.<br /><br />This book speaks of learning from nature, from sages, from looking deep into your own heart. It makes it clear that all true spiritual paths are naturally compatible with the Way of Peace. This Way can transcend time and space itself. Ultimately the Way of the Warrior, like the Art of Politics, is to stop trouble before it starts. You spiritually defeat those who see themselves as adversariies by making them realise that their actions are contrary to the Way, to the balance of Heaven and Earth.rior, like the Art of Politics, is to stop trouble before it starts.

Perhaps it is best that I found it now and not earlier, for it is the supreme example of speculative thinking about the future in my experience. I can't think of another book in the science fiction genre that I could compare it to, for nothing else comes close.<br /> This is the story of a man who takes an evening walk out upon the hills behind his home, only to be seized and swept away by a cosmic vision that seems to span the aeons. At first, he seems to be a single, disembodied point of consciousness with the ability to move at will among the stars. Then, he is drawn to a world of man-like creatures where he comes to enter into telepathic union with one of the natives. He and his host come to explore the entire history of this world before shoving off, together, to explore the other inhabited worlds of the galaxy. They are joined, one by one, by other simular explorers as they come to wander an incredible diversity of inhabited worlds. Slowly, they come to see the larger story of the galaxy, and then the entire cosmos. They see world after world unite into various forms of utopian &quot;world minds.&quot; Then they see these world minds reach across the galaxy to colonise other worlds, and to make contact with other intelligent species. Finally, after aeons of conflict and struggle, all the galaxy is united into one great telepathically linked Galactic Union. Yet even this is but the beginning, for the next step is to make contact with the other galaxies- and with the stars and nebula themselves (for it turns out that the great cosmic bodies of the universe are themselves intelligent.) And when this is accomplished, all three great living super species press on into the higher dimensions of existance to make contact with the Creator himself- the Star Maker....<br />I understand that Stapledon spent part of his youth in Egypt, that would partially explain the ease at which he spans great extents of time, as well as, the rise and fall of great civilizations. Of course, he was also educated at Oxford, which would explain the simularities to Neoplatonism. At any rate, like the narrator, it is hard to believe that Stapledon didn't experience a vision of Cosmic Consciousness himself to inspire such a magnificently complex and profound work.<br />Oh yes, this book is not written like a conventional novel. In fact, there is not a line of conventional dialog in it. It is instead, an extremely concentrated journal of idea after significant idea. As for the ideas, not only does the science hold up remarkably well for a book written in 1937, but if you read closely you find hints of the big bang, the holographic universe, morphogenic fields, the multiverse, cybernetic reality, etc., etc., etc. It reads rather like the journal of a classically educated Englishman of before the war. No, check that, it reads like journal of a classically educated genius....as well as, the rise and fall of great civilizations.

This isn't some Beat nostalgia trip by a Kerouac wannabe. It's much better than that.<br />Here we have the ghost of Jack Kerouac involuntarily returned to earth. He didn't want to come back, but like life and death, it just happened. Also, like life, he has no idea why he has returned. He just awakened into renewed existance, 13 years after his death, looking physically thirteen years older, with a vague memory of having been somewhere else- maybe Mexico.<br />  Kerouac is drawn back to the people who were linked to him in life. It isn't that he has any unfinished business with them, it is almost like a gravitational attraction. He is drawn to those people, and places where his influence lingers. It just so happens that most of the old friends and acquantances that he meets come across as pretty unsympathetic. Because they live so much in past memories they do not recognise him- or believe him, when he tells them who he is. He is just a crazy old bum. That is, except for Gary Snyder, and possibly Gregory Corso. So Kerouac wanders through 80's America becoming increasingly disillusioned by what his friends, and the country, has become. Yet, all through his travels, a mysterious Indian/ trainman/ biker/ sage keeps reappearing with just the right observations and comments....<br />  Oh yes, the author even puts in a bowling ball-pumping cameo. He comes across as an angel. I guess when you write the book, then you get to be an angel if you want to be....	2003-07-14

It took me five days, working 4 to 5 hours a day. I am completely satisfied. This is the best tutorial that I have seen for ANY CAD program, let alone for solid modelling.<br />This was one of two assigned texts for a CAD Solids class that I took. The first text was more of a reference dictionary for the various commands and features- I didn't use it more than once or twice. On the other hand, this book is more of a programmed learning course and I read every page. In fact, I found myself refering back to this book for reference, since I now had hands-on experience now in actually applying the commands (as opposed to merely reading an obtuse, poorly written definition.) The authors of this book literally spell out every single mouse click and keyboard stroke step-by-step as you work through a fairly complex real life project.<br />As for the project, it is a fully solid modelled electric lantern. You build every single component in the assembly, both fabricated and purchased. Then, you unite them into subassemblies and assemblies. Finally, you are shown how to generate working shop drawings (details and assembly) from your models.<br />I have used 3-D and solid modelling programs from competitors. This book, and Solid Works itself, is far superior to anything else out there. This is the practical parametric and solids modelling program that the industry has been promising for the last 12 years or so.<br /> Moreover, if you have this book and access to the program, then you don't really need an instructor.	2003-07-11

Like the entire collection it is printed in a classic typeface on acid-free, cream wove paper with a sewn full cloth binding. It also comes with a crystal cover over the half-jacket. This is a book that will last several lifetimes.<br /> I am not scholar enough to know if this is a complete compilation of the poet's work. However, I have not found it wanting. All the major works such as the Songs of Innocence and Experience, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, America, Europe, The book of Urizen, Milton, Jerusalem, etc., are here; along with a large collection of manuscript fragments and poetical sketches. Moreover there is an informed biographical introduction and a detailed chronology of the author's life compared to the literary context of the time and to historical events. There are also about twenty plates of the artist's own illustrations of his works.<br />One brief note on interpreting the work of this visionary mystic: the four Zoas correspond to Jung's four functions. Urison equals reason and law, Orc equals feeling, Tharmas equals sensing, while Los equals intuition and the visionary.<br />I've heard Blake dismissed as a semi-literate eccentric by some. They have obviously never actually read the man. There are elements of Plato, Plotinus, the Hermetica, the Bhagavad Ghita, the Cabbala, as well as many other mythologies and theologies, imbedded in these works- and in the true spirit of their respective times and cultures.<br />It is no wonder that Bucke lists him as one of the indisputable cases of Cosmic Consciousness.	2003-07-04

Other than for a piece or two in an anthology, I had never read Ferlinghetti, period. Having enjoyed the hospitality of the upstairs poetry room, that seemed somehow ill-mannered of me.<br />Simply put, I liked this collection. The images and meanings are more subtle than a lot of poets with Beat roots. He can really paint a word picture to put you in the scene. You instantly soak up the nuances of the whole. Then maybe he'll nudge you, ever so slightly, into seeing the absurdity in it. Or perhaps he'll interject a reminder of your own mortality in a simular subtle way. It is appropriate that one of the poems deals with Edward Hopper. I get that Hopperesque quality of an observer in an existential urban landscape with much of the collection.<br /> About the only difference that I detected from the first 27 poems (written by 1955) and the 18 new ones (new in 1995) is a difference in rhythm. The older poems have much more of that classic coffee house beat- at least in my head. Of yes, he also uses the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; in one of them.... But the word painting, and sense of subtle absurdity, is still right on the money.	2003-07-04

There are only some seven dreams here, in a little over 50 pages, but it is enough. That is because these are not common dreams.<br />The first dream is entitled _History of Jewish Socialist Party in America_. This is a dream of humor and insecurity centering around a tiny radical group's frantic attempt to convince its single FBI infiltrator that they are worth spying on. It reads like a Woody Allen sketch.<br />The _Texas Power Apocalyse_ comes as close to a prophetic dream as any I've read. It deals with a huge national powergrid centered around a great tower in Texas crashing and taking most of the country with it. It would seem that Ginsberg foresaw Enron....<br />_Ambiguous Guru, Nervous Student_ is another dream of insecurity, but centering around the theme of spirituality. In this dream Ginsberg is desperately trying to get the approval of his Tibeten Guru- and is devastated when he does not get it.<br />_The Book of Good and Evil_ seems to be a visit to what Burroughs called the Place of Dead Roads. It is a nightmare of disturbing images of savage conflict and betrayal.<br />As for _Two Dreams of Jack Kerouac_, the most revealing part is that Jack goes through the very center of the Vast Valley of the World, while Allen turns off to live on the perimeter. This dream also confirms the conviction that society in not embracing, or understanding, Kerouac's American Vision consigned itself to our current sad state. Even in his dreams, Ginsberg never faultered from this vision- he kept the faith.<br />Finally, _Dream Archives_ seems to show what Ginsberg would most like to find. It deals with his inheriting a European Villa full of obscure manuscripts dealing with the pre WWII international, artistic, political, and spiritual scene. Not unlike the way some of us dream of inheriting a place in San Fran full of unpublished Beat manuscripts....tual scene.

Books like this are why cameras were invented.<br />From the mid-50's to 1960 Carole Reiff took her Rolleiflex into the studios, Jazz clubs, concert halls, dressing rooms, and all-night jam sessions of the great ones. She captured the artists of this period better than any other photographer. There is nothing posed or formal about most of these these shots- the spontineity leaps out at you. These artists were totally at ease like the camera wasn't even there. There is no distracting text to get in your way either- the pictures say far more than any words could. You just get page after page of legends before, during, and after the act of creating their art. It is incredible how many of the greats she had access to: Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday (best shots I've ever seen of Lady Day), Lester Young, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Gil Evans, Sarah Vaughan, Ornette Coleman, Ray Charles, Dinah Washington, Bill Evans, Percy Heath, Ella Fitzgerald, Charles Mingus, Count Basie, Sonny Rollins, Dizzy Gillespie, and so many others. Put on a record and get this book out. It is like they live again- or like you are at a big jam session in the sky.<br />Of yes, and the introductory essay by Jack Kerouac, The Beginning of Bop, is exactly right to set the mood. It is one long flowing riff of prose poem by a man who understood the spirit of the age better than any other.	2003-06-30

I remembered that it was a mad mantra of transcendent power from the heart of hell, but I didn't remember how nondated it was. This work is fresher and more relevant than 99% of what passes for poetry today. How can something last nearly 50 years without going stale or becoming trite? How can it be even more real now? Maybe it is because Ginsberg ripped it live, screaming, and bleeding from a place beyond time and beyond space. He tore it from the living bowels of MOLOCH itself and showed it to HIM. After all, what does divine madness know of time?<br />This poem is transcendence itself. It demonstrates that when you plunge into the deepest pit of hell it either kills you, or perhaps it burns out your insides so that you become a soulless zombie, OR you transcend it and rise howling to become a Mad Poet Saint who can truely encompass the Sacred in the Profane.<br />Read this poem, and the others like America, A Supermarket in California, Sunflower Sutra, Wild Orphan, and In Back of the Real. It's almost frightening how relevant to daily life it is. If you didn't know it, you would never guess that it was written in the 50's. Of course Ginsberg does invoke, holy eternity in time holy the clocks in space the fourth dimension, in the Footnote. Maybe that's why it's timeless. As Cassady used to say, we know time, yes, we know time....<br />I wish I would have been there for that first public reading in San Fran with Kerouac running around the audience passing the wine jug. On all the planes, the Gods themselves must have jumped back in shock as a flaming monkeywrench of living poetry was jammed through the spokes of the great quivering meat wheel of conception....	2003-06-30

It is filled with over 100 of her best photographs. It is practically a photographic catalog of all the people you've read about but may never have put a face to: William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, Gregory Corso, Robert Creeley, Diana di Prima, Lawence Ferlinghetti, John Clellon Holmes, Herbert Huncke, Philip Lamantia, Michael McClure, Peter Orlovsky, Kenneth Rexroth, Anne Waldman, Phil Whalen, and so many others. And these photographes are taken for the most part in their own homes and haunts- without that posed sense. Not only that, but the book's introduction, accompanying biographical sketches, and poems are a good introduction to the Beats in it's own right.<br />My only criticism lies, ironically, in the photos of Kerouac. The best Kerouac related photographs are of the funeral and gravesite. The rest are from the last days back in the late sixties when he was living at home with his mother and waiting for death. I'm not saying that these photos don't tell a story, but I wish they were more balanced. Of course, this also demonstrates that Charter's didn't actually meet Jack until well after the _On the Road_ years were gone.<br />Of yes, there is also a sizable section devoted to Ken Kesey, and the legendary bus, though I've never really seen him and his Merry Pranksters as Beats. Still, it's nice to see Kesey, his farm, and what remains of the bus....	2003-06-30

Even though this book was produced to accompany a 1984 Smithsonian exhibition, it truly holds up as a worthy work in its own right. I can't recall seeing the subject of past speculation on the future handled better. It is done in a manner that is both scholarly and interesting. You get a balance of both the popular fictional conception of the future, as well as, more \\"official\\" versions from government and corporate think tanks.<br />The real strength of the book is it's vast number of both color and black and white illustrations. You have everything from ink engravings from 19th century illustrated newspapers and penny dreadfuls, to the glorious 4 color covers of 1930's pulp magazines, to film stills of the \\"modern era\\" (Star Wars, Blade Runner, and Road Warrior.)<br />I found the ideas in the insightful text most interesting. It is pointed out that the popular image of the past changes and evolves through time. The Victorians and Edwardians seem to assumed that the future would be much like their heirarchical and elite present, just with bigger buildings and more complex machines. The first half of the 20th century was driven largely by an utopian, often socialist, vision of a better future for all. However, the vision that seems to dominate the later half of the century is a grim, corporate, cyberpunk nightmare.<br />As Arthur C. Clark points out in the text, the future isn't what it used to be.	2003-06-24

This is an excellent retrospective of the art of Dr. Suess (Theodor Geisel), published for the first major exhibition of his work in 1986. Written before his untimely death, it covers everything from his earliest student sketch books to _You're Only Old Once!_.<br /> While the cleverness of the good doctor's prose is sampled, it is really his artwork that steals the show. The book is filled with both glorious full color, as well as black and white, examples. There are also reproductions of most of the cover illustrations. The truly rare aspect of this book though, is the biographical insights that it gives into the artist's life. The struggles that he went through with underemployment and just trying to survive in the 1930's are especially inspiring these days.<br /> It is fascinating to see the artist's early magazine (Judge and Life) and advertising work (Flit and Esso.) The only noticable omission is his early Hollywood collaboration. There is absolutely no mention of the early Horton cartoons, or of \\"5000 Fingers of Dr. T.\\"<br />I especially enjoyed this book because of an incident that happened to me in grade school. I was always fascinated by the art in these books, but when I tried to look at them in third grade, I was told that I couldn't because they were below my \\"age level.\\" That is a lie, these books, and this art, transcend any bureaucratic, mindless, age grouping. They are ageless and timeless.	2003-06-24

Up to that time it was the only popular book on planetary geology. I remember that the section on Mars was especially interesting and extensive. Of course, thorough as always, Asimov also speculated on the nature of the environments of the other terrestrial planets and the moons of the gas giants. It was quite well illustrated with black and white illustrations.<br />This book fueled an interest in planetary geology in me that persists to the present day.

Its primary duties are to defend the United Federation of Planets from any and all enemies and invaders; to keep open the space lanes; to render any necessary humanitarian assistance to any in need; and to explore, colonize, and develop frontier regions. This manual describes the assets of Star Fleet that enable it to fulfill those obligations. Moreover, it gives the full historical roster of ships going back to the founding of the service on Stardate 0/8910.<br />Every class of starship is listed: Combat Vessels (assault ships, battleships, corvettes, cruisers, cutters, destroyers, escorts, frigates, monitors, scouts), Support Vessels (transports, freighters, warpshuttles) and Repair Vessels and Facilities (tenders, tugs, mobile docks, and defense outposts.) The full historical range of vessels from the Constitution, Anton, Larson, and Nelson class ships of \\"The Great Awakening\\" to the Excelsior and Scorpio classes of the present day are detailed.<br />Each class of ship is shown in profile, top, and bow-on view. Then there is a full specification section listing: Construction Data (model numbers, date entered service, and total number constructed), Hull Data (length, width, height, weight, cargo capacity, and landing capability), Equipment Data ( control computer type, number and type of transporters), Personnel Data (crew, passenger, and shuttle craft capacities), Engine and Power Data (warp engine type and number, maximum safe cruising speed, emergency speed, impulse engine type), Weapons (beam weapon type and number, missile weapon type and number), Shields Data (deflector shield type and maximum power) and the Combat Efficiency Rating. In addition, a note section is included listing the brief history of the class, strengths and weaknesses, and exploits and anecdotes of famous representative vessels.<br />The appendixes include both a fold out chart of Federation Recognition Silhouettes and a Full Timeline of Active Duty Service of all classes.<br />In summation, this manual provides all known combat, visual, and historical data on all 42 different Federation ships and their varients.

You know that nothing has been watered down when the very first chapter is a review of the fundamentals of calculus. The editor states outright that this work was written at the level of a first year GRADUATE student in engineering. Even though this classic set was published in 1967, it is still a staple in many engineering offices across the country. In my opinion it represents the high water mark of all that was best in the engineering profession.<br /> Volume one deals with the basic sciences (mathematics, physics, chemistry, graphics, statistics, theory of experiments, and mechanics.)<br /> Volume two deals with the applied sciences (thermal phenomena, heat and mass transfer, chemical energy conversion, turbomachinery, nuclear reactor engineering, aeronautics and astronautics, field theory, electromechanical energy conversion, physical electronics, electronic circuits, system dynamics, material science, machine elements, control systems, operations research, information retrieval, preparation of reports, and computers.)<br />I wouldn't be too worried about the material presented here being obsolete. Potter carefully chose the from the enduring fundamentals in each area. In fact, it is informative to compare this set with modern references to determine where \\"dumbing down\\" may have occured in the modern engineering curriculum.	2003-06-18

That is why history departments still quote Alexis de Toqueville as an unbiased outside observer after all these years. I suspect that future historians may refer to this book in the same manner.<br />The author, a former anti-Soviet dissident, once saw the American political and corporate power structure as an ally and role model. Then, upon actually seeing the reality of the American capitalist system, first hand, and on it's own turf, he began to realise that it was just the &quot;other end of the same stick&quot; when compared to Soviet state capitalism. He saw it was the same old story, a small elite at the top benefitting from everything while spinning an illusion of lies. This massive volume shows the facts of the corporate/government/military monolith that has usurped the true Ameican Democracy.<br />Read this, sometimes it takes an intelligent outsider to show you how badly you have been fooled.	2003-06-12

This seventh and final collection unites nearly all the past characters and story archs into a grand unified theory of metaphysics (an explanation of the nature of the world- and what lies beyond it.) In fact, it ties together some loose story threads that I had given up on entirely. It reads like a teflon-coated bullet; what isn't action packed is shocking, what isn't shocking is arousing, and what isn't arousing is an intellectual roller coaster. If you read it through in one sitting like I did, you are going to need a bottle of aspirin....<br />There is some pretty deep philosophical stuff imbedded in here. I recognised concepts on the true nature of time that could have come right out of Ouspensky. In fact, that's what the whole grand opera seems to be leading up to here- Morrison is trying to shake us out of our complacent sleep walking and open us up to looking behind the accepted \\"reality\\" of things. This can lead to either individual transcendence, or, as Morrison seems to speculate, it can lead to a leap in evolution for the entire species. You see, all the strange and unexplainable stuff that is breaking into our world these days are just the growing pains of an expanded consciousness. Larval man is about to break through the veil, enmass. What is terrifying to us now will later be seen as aspects of reality that were only temporarily frightening because of their newness and strangeness. Even opposites unite at the next higher level.<br />My only criticism is with the unevenness of the artwork. With so many pencillers and inkers working on the project you lose consistency. You can go from an almost photographic level of draftsmanship in one section, to cartoonish caricature in the next. That can distract from the smooth flow of the story line.<br />Oh yes, and if you get to Benares- don't drink the water....	2003-06-11

This is where Burroughs got so many of the images for his life time of work. You see, this is a tour book of The Land of the Dead, or as he also called it, The Place of Dead Roads. While he subtitles this work _A Book of Dreams_ he is careful to point out that these are a very special sort of dream. They are dreams that are more real than waking life. Indeed, the author speculates if the dreaming city isn't really his true home, his true life- far more real than Lawrence, Kansas.<br />You can't expect to read a book like this in the same way that you would read an ordinary book. You must unfocus your mind, in the same way that you must unfocus your eyes to truly SEE some abstract art. Only then will the images begin to flow and transport you. That is because this book is a conscious act of magic, as the old magician knew when he crafted it....<br />See if the Land of the Dead doesn't start to seem very familiar to you. I know I immediately recognised the place he was describing. It is a place where the dead, the sleeping, the magical travellers all meet. That is why the landscape and architecture are such a tangle, why there are no clear distinctions between public and private places. It is a mad, mixed, consensus &quot;reality.&quot; That is also why flight is possible there. You see, in such a place gravity isn't a law- it is an opinion....	2003-06-05

As Carl Llewellyn Weschcke states on the first page in his introduction this book is a RECONSTRUCTION of the Druidic Tradition. In this sense it is as accurate and authoritative as any other reconstruction. Indeed, this is the best I have seen because it intuitively taps into the spirit and essense of the old Celtic priestly cast. Monroe is a primal mystic that understands other primal mystics throughout the ages.<br /><br />The book itself is a masterful blend of fictional narrative and detailed lore. Indeed, there is a great store of knowlege between and within the threads of the story. It is all consistent with the great wisdom teachings of East and West- there is no hidden left hand path stuff here.<br /><br />If you want to immerse yourself into the Druidic mind set, take this book and go camping in an oak grove for a week.

It does contain in condensed form most of the practical skills that a field geologist needs for collecting and documenting samples, preparing standardised sections and maps, and writing a formal report.<br />The manual is organised as follows: 1) Observing and Collecting Data and Samples, 2) Using the Compass, Clinometer, and Hand Level, 3) The Compass Traverse, 4) Plotting Geologic Features on a Base Map, 5) Mapping Geologic Features on Aerial Photographs, 6) The Alidade and Plane Table, 7) Control for Geologic Maps, 8) Geologic Mapping with the Alidade and Plane Table, 9) Making a Geologic Map from Aerial Photographs, 10) Detailed Mapping and Sampling, 11) Preparing Geologic Reports, 12) Field Work with Sedimentary Rocks, 13) Field Work with Volcanic Rocks, 14) Field Work with Igneous and Igneous-appearing Plutonic Rocks, and Field Work with Metamorphic Rocks. The appenixes include 1) check lists of equipment and supplies (you do not want to be in the middle of the mountains or desert and discover that you forgot something vital), 2) standard field note abbreviations (other people have to be able to decipher those field notes), 3) percentage estimation charts, 4) geologic map symbols, 5)  lithologic symbols for cross sections, 6) an isogonic chart for compass correction, and 7) trig tables.<br />If you can master these skills then you are competent to do the  initial geologic field work from the Gobi Desert to Antarctica to...Mars. If you haven't mastered most of these skills, then you aren't really a Geologist.<br />This book should be thoroughly read at least once BEFORE you get to field camp.	2003-06-02

Not only do you get hard to find material from limited circulation publications (from Bravo for Adventure, to The Fox, to Zorro), but you also have a great deal of unpublished material from Toth's personal sketchbooks. Not only that, but the artist writes extensive commentary about just how he concieves both characters and plots. Further, he comments on the artists that most influenced his own work and development over the years.<br />The introduction is written by Milton Caniff (Terry and the Pirates & Steve Canyon.)	2003-05-30

This volume is exactly what I was looking for. It covers the fundamentals of astronomy, chemistry (including organic), physics (including nuclear physics), geology, meteorology, and oceanography. For each subject, one is given a concentrated section of basic facts about the subject (rather like a concentrated page or two of test study notes) and then a self-test. The emphasis is mostly on facts and principles, though there are a few problems to be worked out- with examples.<br />If you are looking for a good review to refresh what you learned in college, or a good college prep High School, then this is the book for you. It is probably a little too condensed for use as a first text, however. It is better to use it as a refresher course.<br />If you can get through the 32 self-tests in this book with a decent score, then you are still competent in the basic principles of all the physical sciences. If you do not score too highly, then review the fact section and retake the tests- and you will be competent.	2003-05-29

If you want to really understand the basic geology of the country that you are traveling through, from the North West Territories to the Yucatan, then this book is for you. Several decades ago, this was my college textbook for Geology of the U.S. In my opinion there has never been a better single text written to take its place. King was an old time classical field geologist- he knows this continent like the back of his hand. I usually just leave it in my suit case as a permanent reference.<br />The basic organization of this book is as follows: 1)The Natural History of the Continents, 2) The Canadian Shield, 3) The Interior Lowlands, 4) Appalachian and related Systems, 5) Lands and Seas South of the Continent, 6) The Cordilleran System, 7) The Eastern Ranges and Plateaus, 8) The Main Part of the Cordillera,and 9) Later Modifications of the Cordillera including the Coast Ranges.<br />The real strength of the book is the many extremely well-done maps and cross-sections. There is even a full fold-out geological map of all of North America in the back of the book- along with a full index.	2003-05-29

However, just because it is a &quot;comic book&quot; and uses well-selected illustrations to drive home its point (often with considerable good-natured humor), do not think that it isn't also an insightful and well-researched guide into the workings of the capitalist system.<br />  This book isn't a piece of &quot;free market&quot; propoganda. The author consistantly points out the shortcomings, absurdities, and out right injustice of the system. In fact, his examination of why so many Americans continue to support the capitalist system, when it is clearly contrary to the best interests of 9 out of 10 of us, is among the best I've seen.<br />  After reading this book you will know the basic textbook concepts of economics. You will know mecantilism from monetism, and microeconomics from macroeconomics. You will be familiar with the theories of Adam Smith, Karl Marx, John Maynard Keynes, F.A. Hayek, and Milton Freidman. You will understand the law of the falling rate of profit, and how paying lower wages can only temporarily offset this. You will know what a multinational corporation is and how they operate. Indeed, the author's warning about &quot;corporatism&quot; (in 1981) is down right prophetic.<br />  Some people might be tempted to write this book off as dated or obsolete because it was first published in 1981. On the contrary, because of the good old &quot;business cycle&quot; conditions are once again very simular to those of the early eighties....<br />  The author is no wild-eyed radical. He was a Distinguished Professor of Economics at the City University of New York.	2003-05-26

In fact, the thrill I got from flipping through this book was only topped by the thrill I got when I was first given the key to the &quot;sample room&quot; (i.e. a room containing reference samples of almost all U.S. made model kits.) The photography and descriptions are crisp, informative, and professional, and if this isn't a complete listing of the Aurora inventory (except for those few items that never when into full-scale production) then my memory is going. In fact, knowing as I do the terrible state of the drawings and other record keeping in several companies from this period, I marvel at how the author did such an exceptional job.  I just wish there was an equally comprehensive, equally well-produced guide for all the various companies that I either worked for or had dealings with (Monogram, Revell, Ertl, AMT, Airfix, Testor, Linberg, ect.) I always thought the Aurora line was the best in the industry, but if I would have admitted that about a competitor I probably would have gotten canned.<br />In fact, this book is alot more fun than actually working in the business....	2003-05-26

It is set early in the 20th century during the oil boom in the Oklahoma \\"channel sands.\\" Yet, this story could just as easily been set just about anywhere oil fever hit- and the Rockefellers got there claws into it.<br />  Firstly, this is a novel about the indomitable will of one woman who refuses to keep anyone and anything from keeping her from bringing in her wildcat well: not a nere-do-well father, not romance, not sexist oil men and bankers, not Rockfeller thugs.<br /> Yet, it is the secondary theme of what the oil patch was really like that steals the show. The technical details are all correct, as are the labor conditions and political climate (Rockefeller WAS the government.) Indeed the shere ruthlessness of the times is perfectly captured- you get one chance to do \\"business\\" with Standard Oil, after that your rights, and your life, weren't worth a plug nickel.<br />  The author, also wrote the excellent screenplay for the movie that starred George C. Scott and Jack Palance. Strangely that film is impossible to find these days. In fact, this excellent book didn't even go to paperback. It was written around the time of the great \\"oil crisis\\" of 1973. It is almost like someone doesn't want the true story of the American oil industry brought to light....	2003-05-26

The worst thing that ever happened to the Bible was division into chapter and verse notation. When that happened it ceased to be so much a holy book as it became a law book. Prior to such notation one had to read the scriptures as a whole. One had to absorb the Spirit of the whole, instead of using a pick-and-choose study approach of those specific lines (usually taken out of context) that supported one's specific agenda. Indeed, text and verse division did not come into being until the 16th century- long after the end of high point of traditional Christiandom and the start of the age of the profane. The Tyndale is a wholistic work uncorrupted by artificial text and verse division. No doubt this was why the ruling class of the day considered it to be so dangerous.<br />Tyndale translated this work, alone, from the original Greek. This is not the work of a committee with an ax to grind. Actually, this is the translation that all English Bibles, including the King James, was based on until the 20th century. It seems no one else even attempted to translate the whole book from scratch into English from Greek until the modern age. Unless you can read Koine Greek yourself, it is still the best alternative.<br />I have heard various experts state that the King James version &quot;eliminated&quot; biases in the Tyndale. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The King James is in fact an edited and censored version of the Tyndale. If there was intensional bias involved it was in the minds of the rich and powerful who had Tyndale and his Bible consigned to the flames- and replaced with a &quot;politically correct&quot; substitute.<br />Tyndale's sole purpose was to get the undistorted, uncorrupted, word of God, as best he knew it, to the English people. He gave his life for that purpose. I prefer to trust his version for this reason.	2003-05-17

I've had this set for over 15 years now. The three coin system is much, much easier to use than the yarrow stick system. I suppose that there might be an increased opportunity for \\"chance\\" (or rather synchronicity) to operate with the more elaborate yarrow technique, but after using both, I see no difference between them. Both generate equally reliable hexagrams that express the underlying currents flowing through your life. At least they do if you are appropriately centered after deep meditation.<br />The \\"key cards\\" that come with this deck allow you to quickly identify just what hexagram you have cast by number. After that, it is simply a matter of picking that number from the 64 traditional hexagrams in the deck. The card will give you the translation of the traditional meaning from the I Ching, as well as, the further meanings of the \\"moving lines.\\"<br />For further explanation of the deeper meanings of the hexagrams you might like Sam Reifler's _I Ching_ as a convenient and perceptive reference aid.<br />By the way, there is nothing special about the three brass coins included with the deck- though they are a little easier to use than pennies.	2003-05-14

Then, I bought my own copy of this second edition and found that the ideas contained in it had lost none of their power and were every bit as profound as I had remembered.<br />Briefly, this book deals with the concept of synchronicity or meaningful coincidence. It deals with it on two levels, the level of science and the level of myth. Indeed, it is shown that synchronistic events in themselves demonstrate the interpenetration of matter (the realm of science) and mind (the realm of myth.) Synchronicity is shown to leap the gap between not only the conscious and unconscious aspects of the mind, but between the world of mind and the world objective events. In this way it corresponds very well to the myth of Hermes, the god of boundaries, and the messenger between the world of the gods and the world of men.<br />The greatest strength of this book over other treatments of the topic is the clear and up-to-date manner that it addresses the possible scientific explanations of synchronicity. It draws primarily from the world of the new physics. Here is an extremely clear explanation of Bohm's theories on a holographic universe with explicate (physical, day-to-day) and implicate (hidden and fundamental) orders. In spite of the references to the modern world of subatomic physics, it struck me that this sounds remarkably like the hidden currents of the cosmos that occultists have always alluded to. The pattern based theories of Sheldrake, Laszlo, and Chester are also examined and compared. Indeed, the concepts of morphic fields and resonance seem to uncannily resemble the old magical principles of sympathy and correspondence between our own world and the world of archetypes. Indeed, it is shown that a balanced mind (both hemispheres at the same frequency) in deep meditation or prayer may be able to \\"range\\" the implicate order and bring about increased instances of synchronicity. Since it is suggested that synchronicity is the real basis for all ESP phenomena ( telepathy, precognition, psychokinesis, etc.) it could be said that this is an effective explanation for the concept of sympathetic magic.<br />The use of the concept of the mythological trickster is especially appropriate and effective. Many times synchronistic coincidences seem to exist for no other reason that to shatter our preconceived and ossified concepts of the universe. That was also the function of Hermes/ Mercurius/ Coyote in mythology.

It is based on the Placidus system of house division, but I have never seen any flaw with this model. If you use any of the other house division systems you will no doubt find these tables to be of limited usefulness. Otherwise, you have all the well laid out and easy to read tables that you need for locating house cusps: tables of houses for 0 to 60 degree north, solar-siderial time correction, time correction for longitude, diurnal motion of the sun and planets, semidiurnal motion of the moon, etc. There is even a convenient table of longitudes and latitudes for major cities in both the U.S. and the rest of the world.<br />There is even a clearly written introduction on how to cast a natal horoscope with included examples. Of course you are also going to need a good ephemerides for planet location. I recommend the Rosicrucian ephemerides in conjunction with this book.	2003-05-11

This is because it delves into the deep mythological symbolism behind the planets and signs. It is an excellent reference for fleshing-out a written horoscope with more than the basics. This isn't a book that is going to teach you how to cast a horoscope, however, it will help you to interpret a horoscope in terms of the deep archetypical patterns and currents for which the stars and planets are merely visible markers.<br />Indeed, this book goes beyond providing mere historical details and trivia, it is a starting place for deep meditation on the underlieing meaning in a chart.	2003-05-11

When I was introduced to the Rosicrucian ephemeris I promptly sold the one that I had been using. In my opinion, this is the most accurate and convenient ephemerides in existance (it is based on the newest standards of the International Astronomical Union, as well as, the latest research conducted by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.) It is also computer typeset to eliminate human error. You have all the data you need for planet and lunar node calculation right in front of you on a single page. Plus time is based on midnight and not noon figures, so it saves you a correction in your calculations.<br />Perhaps I am old fashion in my thinking, but if you cannot use an ephemerides and a book of tables to erect a natal horoscope by hand (at least once) then you do not really understand astrology.<br />The introduction for this edition is written in English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian. The tables use standard symbolism that any user should understand regardless of language.<br />As for this volume being &quot;obsolete&quot;, the vast majority of people currently living were born between 1900 and 2000, so this will be a useful tool for many years to come.	2003-05-11

Prior to Cockren, alchemical work was generally ignored or dismissed as unreadable and meaningless, nonsense and quackery. Cockren saw the meaning, the Divine Plan, in the writings of the great alchemists. He saw that alchemy was primarily a spiritual work. He translated and explained the hidden truths of the Sacred Science into language that modern seekers could begin to understand. If I am not mistaken his rediscovery of these truths actually preceeded Jung's.<br />Here in this book, you will find the explanation of the terminology, processes, and principles that you will need to understand the alchemical source works of Paracelsus, Flamel, Valentine, St. Germain, Cremer, Lully, Albertus Magnus, Villanova, Geber, Rhasis, Hermes, etc. Here are the Stages of the Alchemical Opus: melanosis, leukosis, xanthosis, and iosis or rubedo. Here is the Process of Operations: calcination, solution, separatio, conjunctio, putrifaction, ablutio, and rebedo. You will understand the difference between aqua fortis, aqua regia, and aqua vitae. You will have the keys to unlock hidden meanings.<br />Cockren wasn't merely an interpreter of the classic texts- he was a metalurgist and chemist who actually duplicated the work where ever possible. He actually observed these processes and learned their lessons. He understood the spiritual analogies and lessons that these experiments taught. He understood the meaning behind mere material things....	2003-05-11

You can easily tuck it into your breast pocket, or pack, when you take off for the wilderness. In this way you would not be far different from the Irish monks that it describes- men who heard the call and went forth into strange countries in Peregrinatio. These were the sort of men who reintroduced the spark of Christianity into Europe after it had all but died out. Yet, these weren't rigid, dogmatic, schoolmen and theologians. These were mystic wanderers looking for the divinely appointed place where they would have their ultimate meeting with God. Until that time, they would trust Providence that they would be led to where they would do the most good.<br />This sort of holy pilgrim and mystic was in no way unique to Ireland, or even Christianity. The way of pilgrimge to take the faithful back to the center and source, to the place of theophany and renewel is a part of all great religious traditions. This little book, however, focuses on the Christian traditions ranging from the Desert Fathers, to the medieval pilgrimages and crusades, to Mt. Athos, to Russian startsy, to the gentle Shakers of Pleasant Hill. There is an great deal covered in such a small package.<br />Whenever I start to grow depressed with what I see of formal religion around me, I refer to this book to remind me of the mystic wellsprings from which it all arose- and will one day return to.	2003-05-11

This in no way limits its appeal to those of different rules and orders- or to complete outsiders. That is because this book is a concise, beautiful, expanation of the great theological principles without which monastic life would have no meaning. You will not find the many details of monastic rules, observances, ascetism, and prayer here. What who will find are intimations of what it truly means to live a life in constant contemplation of the mystery of Christ.<br />The epilog concerning the monk in the changing world is especially interesting. Written in 1957, Merton clearly saw that Communism contained the seeds of it's own destruction. Yet, he also had his resevations about unrestrained capitalism. As he points out, the monk is no reactionary out to preserve anything- his primary function is to keep himself alive by contact with God.<br />The monk is a Soldier of Christ appointed to fight his battles on a spiritual, hidden front, in mystery. While a true monk is obedient, humble, and self-sacrificing, he is also among the very few in the modern world who refuses to bow down before money, power, science, and the machine. The duty of the monk is to be a man of God- a man that lives by and for God alone. Robes and gothic walls are the least part of this.	2003-05-08

This book, originally published in 1956, was my first introduction to comparative religion. Because the subject is essentially timeless, one could do far worse than to use it as a starting point even today. On the first page of the forward it draws the distinction between prophets and priests, and how both are found in every great religious tradition. I never forgot that. The perspective of the text is to look towards the truly prophetic and divinely inspired in all the priestly religions- to cut through the ossified forms and rituals. Above all, it points out that a worthy God, the true God, must be a God of all peoples.<br />Besides this enlightened approach to the unity of religious traditions, this book serves well in the secondary function as a reference book on the basic core beliefs, history, practices, holy days, customs, and sects of all the principle religions of the world. Well organised into sections on Brahmanic Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese Religions, Religion of Japan, and the Semitic Religions, with a full index, it is easy to quickly look up the detail you need. I know I've reached for my copy more times than I can count over the years.	2003-05-08

I was amazed at how peceptive and witty this treatment really is. It makes a great review for the already knowledgeable, and I can see where it would also be an excellent first introduction.<br />The book covers Jung's early childhood history, his work and differences with Freud, the basics of Jungian Analytical Psychology, type theory, the psychology of religion, the uncanny and synchronicity, the I Ching, astrology, alchemical speculation, and it even addresses and debunks some of the controversial criticisms of his personal life and work. There is also really useful &quot;little dictionary&quot; in the back for those who are not yet familiar with Jungian terminology, or psychology in general.<br />The illustrations of this book are not mere cut-and-paste filler and distraction, but they exactly augment and demonstrate the topics being discussed. While some might dismiss this as an instructional comic book, there is no obvious &quot;dumbing down&quot; involved.<br />This is a excellent and insightful little book. In fact, I intend to read it again.	2003-05-08

This is a powerful spiritual book, yet it is not without humor, tolerance of other traditions, and guts.  The guts come in with the liberal criticism of modern greed, materialism, nihilism and the status quo. Franck especially has no patience for what he calls pseudo-spirituality, which can be recognised by sentimentality, proselytising, fanaticism, holier-than-thou delusions, spiritual tourism, and unconcern for the suffering and injustice inflicted on the great majority of other people in the world.<br />Franck points out that true spirituality is based on first hand experience. This means that it is equally valid whether it is approached from Christian, Taoist, Buddhist, Jewish, or Sufi perspectives. This is not not spiritual tourism , it is recognising the Transcendent in all true paths. This is the basis of a vital, transcultural, transreligious spirituality.<br />The author served as a doctor with Albert Schweitzer's staff in Africa- and it truly shows.	2003-05-08

I think I was drawn to this book because I wish that such a place as Miskatonic University really existed.

Now that's an interdisciplinary approach to education....<br />I ordinarily do not read &quot;theme&quot; collections of short stories, especially when I have never heard of most of the contributors. However, in this case it works. The theme seems to have inspired the writers to do some exceptional work.

In fact, I was very sorry that I let my own copy go, because it is out of print and difficult to find- or at least it used to be.<br />If you find the disfunctional family genre of humor amusing, then this is the book for you. Think of &quot;Married with Children&quot; on steroids. Moreover, if you were born in a working class family, on the wrong side of the tracks, anywhere in the rust-belt, then you'll find much to identify with. Most of the action is set during the Eisenhower recession of the late 50's (boy, do I remember that one....)<br />The character development is exceptional and excentric, but it is Red Loop, the father of Jarvis, the main character, that steals the show. Here is a bowling ball-pumping, forge-working, two-fisted Hercules of a working class hero. He takes nothing from nobody, no matter how great the odds against him. Yet, when called &quot;stupid&quot; he spends a summer reading two hundred classic books and jotting down his opinions of them in a private notebook....<br />I easily rank this book up in the top three or four funniest novels that I've ever read. There are truly some laugh-out-loud funny scenes here. The only problem is the way Rosenthal decided to end this book after all the laughs- it is literally like a punch in the gut.	2003-05-08

Whenever someone asks me where he or she should start in order to break their mind free from its habitual sleepwalking, into an expanded view of reality, this remarkable book is where I suggest that they start. I've read it at least three times now- and I'm quite prepared to do so again.<br />This book is about the unconscious as much as it is religious experience (as opposed to religious dogma.) This is because the author sees the unconscious as the matrix from which God reaches out to us. He isn't saying that God is merely another name for the unconscious- he is saying that the unconscious is the interface whereby we interact with God. The perspective is Jungian, yet it goes far beyond Jung's published works. This is because the author recognizes that the unconscious is far more vast than even Jung imagined. The purpose of this work is to ready us for our own interaction with the unconscious- and therefore, God.<br />A perfect example of a man being driven to his limits, and as a result, being forced into a new level of awareness and consciousness, is the author's account of his harrowing experiences in Calcutta, India. He found himself transformed into a defacto saddhu, or wandering holy man, against his will. He was suddenly hungry, homeless, and defenseless among the homeless and outcast in the city of Kali- and experienced an enlightenment, or epiphany, of &quot;oneness&quot; as a result.  This man was truly in the &quot;Belly of the Whale.&quot; If you've ever been in similar conditions, you will recognize the unmistakable truth of the account. Such an experience either breaks or kills you- or you break through the veil....	2003-05-05

Whenever I travel through the hills of SW Wisconsin I keep an eye open for Enoch Wallace's house. Simak has me convinced that it, and its owner, must be real. You cannot read this book without feeling that Enoch is an old, old friend. There is something about this 19th century man's lonely vigil through the centuries that seems right. Only a person so completely human could treat alien visitors with such unstinting hospitality- and humanity. They are just &quot;folks&quot;, a might peculiar, but still folks. I can also believe that the old timers back in the hills would not give him up to outsiders if he did exist- not if he minded his own business, not if he belonged there.	2003-05-04

Here, he returns, one last time, to many of the favorite topics, characters, and settings of so many of his other books and stories. All in one book you have time travel, alternate dimensions, robots, a vast brotherhood of friendly aliens, a very dog-like wolf (ala City), not to mention many other familiar elements. It is all contained in a very complex, skillfully woven, unpredictable narrative.<br />It is fitting that that this book should address the issues of immortality, eternity, and the purpose of life. After all, it was written only two years before the author died (peacefully and in his sleep.) You find immortality achieved by means of fields that hold time at bay, by artificially becoming points of pure intellect, by evolutionary means, by intelligent machines, etc. There is also the understanding that mankind has infinite potential to grow in intellect and understanding. Indeed, it is clearly stated that without consciousness and understanding the universe would lack meaning. That is the ultimate purpose of all sentient beings- to give meaning to the universe.<br />This is a mature, thoughtful, science fiction novel. It is not an old style shoot-em-up space opera, though it does have some pretty good killer monsters in the pay of sinister aliens from the future.<br />All in all, I found this novel to be an excellent capstone to a distinguished career. The old magic never dimmed. I actually postponed reading this book, for I knew that there would be no more coming after I had finished this one....	2003-05-04

It takes place more than a thousand years after technological civilization has collapsed, not from global war, but from it's own internal contradictions and injustices. In several of Simak's novels he mentions this theme of mankind having taken the &quot;wrong turn&quot; long ago in it's development, and thereby containing the unrecognised seeds of its own destruction. Here, the mass of the people themselves apparently tore down their own civilization because it's &quot;over-civilised&quot;, &quot;over-organsed&quot;, and &quot;over-technological&quot; nature had become a hell to them. The creation of pyramids of robot brain cases (like the pyramids of skulls left by the Mongols as they sacked more ancient civilizations) was a nice touch.<br />  This story takes place long after this collapse. The tiny remnant of mankind that survives has settled in to a more traditional tribal pattern. The hero of the tale lives in a monastic-like walled university, where the last books, and readers, preserve the tales of mankind's lost heritage. While browsing the in the ancient university library a young scholar finds a lost manuscript that tells of a &quot;Place of Going to the Stars&quot; far to the West. He then takes up his bow and his pack and leaves the safety of the universitiy walls to confirm the truth of the old myths and legends for himself. His travels are through a forgotten, wild, and savage America and read more like a tale of the frontier than of the far future.<br />This is classic Simak and contains many of the classic elements and settings found in his other works, such as _A Choice of Gods_ and _Enchanted Pilgrimage_. A very enjoyable read.	2003-05-03

Frankly, I thought that my favorite science fiction author had written a clunker. Then, after rereading it after all these years, I finally got it. This is a spiritual allegory.<br />What threw me off the first time was the fact that, unique to any other Simak novel, the lead character is absolutely obnoxious. Captain Michael Ross is a completely arrogant, intolerant, and bigoted specimen. We get a hint of his ruthlessness and lack of conscience from his original profession- \\"planet finder.\\" This means that he locates new worlds for profit and turns them over to developers to subdivide and exploit. That's where he makes his big mistake- he sells an already inhabited planet. This means he has to run and hide on earth to escape the people who are looking for him. Once on earth he is desperate to get into space again. So he becomes part of an expedition that he has absolutely no faith in- but the pay is good. He has total disrespect for every one else in the party (a woman big-game hunter, a blind mystic, and a monk.) He makes it clear that he considers them all to be freaks and defectives to varying degrees.<br />Then, the expedition begins to collapse under his leadership. He is slowly forced to interact with the people that he has held in such contempt. He finds that just because he doesn't understand the other members of the party, that doesn't mean that they do not have valuable God-given gifts. His own arrogance and certainty that his is the only correct way of seeing and doing things slowly erodes as the party makes it's way through the alien wilderness. Finally, sick and out of his head he has a vision that perhaps there is more to space and time than he ever dreamed of in his limited view of things. Finally, he is left to ponder alone as, one by one, the other members of the expedition find their own higher destinies....<br />Here we have once again a story based on Simak's sophisticated intuition that there are many universes and many sentient levels at certain space-time intervals. It is just that our sensitivity to these levels have to evolve before we can access them. In other words, the kingdom of heaven is all about us, but we just don't see....ated intuition that there are many universes and many sentient levels at certain space-time intervals.

Whenever someone asks me where to start in order to break out of their habitual sleep walking into an expanded view of reality, this volume is what I suggest. Personally, I've read it three times over the years- and I am perfectly willing to do so once again.<br />This is a book as much about the unconscious as it is about religious experience (as opposed to religious dogma.) This is because the author sees the unconscious as the matrix from which God reaches out to us. He isn't saying that God is merely another name for the unconscious- he is saying that the unconscious is the interface whereby we interact with God. The perspective is Jungian, but it goes far beyond Jung's published views. Indeed, the unconscious is seen as far vaster than even Jung imagined. The real purpose of this work is to ready us for contact with this vast unconscious, and by doing so, with God.<br />This book is also an excellent starting point for the study of the phenomenon of synchronicity, or meaningful &quot;coincidence.&quot; In case you aren't familiar with this concept, a perfect example would be the fact that I searched for others who shared my birthdate before writing this review. Then, when I pulled this book up to write my review, I found that the only other one written was done on that date, my birthday. It is pointed out that the increasing frequency of such &quot;coincidences&quot; indicates that you are on the path to making meaningful connection with this higher realm or reality. You have broken through the veil and are on your way.	2003-05-02

These are tales of a time when the rule of men was on the rise and the rule of magic was passing from the earth. Sometimes it seems that old scores are being settled with the human usurpers, other times, like the worthyness of humans to rule is being tested. In any case, these stories chiefly survived unto the present day as &quot;faery tales&quot; to amuse children. Yet, just perhaps, they are something more....<br />There is a great variety of material gathered in this volume. You have classic tales from the celtic Mabinogion, the Arthurian Romances, the Tales of the Arabian Nights, on the other hand, you have folk and fairy tales from France, Germany, Scotland, Sweden, Iceland, etc.<br />This is another excellent volume from the &quot;Enchanted World&quot; series published by Time Life. The illustrations are especially fine, and come from a great variety of classic sources and illustrators.	2003-05-01

It also shows how this seems to explain the simularity between the reports of &quot;gods&quot; and faery folk in the past, with reports of UFO's and their occupants in the present. It is interesting that Vallee (who was the model for the French scientist in &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;) doesn't see UFO's as extraterrestrial visitors. He maintains that they have always been here with us.<br />Here we have the idea that our everyday conception of space and time is merely an illusion. The universe is a much stranger and more complicated place than we assume. Space and time are illusionary constructs for a limited consciousness. The truth appears to be closer to a holographic universe. As Vallee states it, the synchronicity and coincidence that abound in our lives suggest that the world may be organised like a randomized data base (the multiverse) rather than a sequential library (the four dimensional world of convensional physics.) Occationally human beings see beyond the illusory curtain of space-time, but it seems to take a major &quot;shake-up&quot; of the individual's mind and habitual way of seeing things. Sometimes this &quot;shake up&quot; seems to come from without- from the &quot;visitors.&quot; But this is not an &quot;invasion&quot;, it is instead a spiritual system that acts on humans and uses humans.<br />A book that further explores this theme is _Daimonic Reality_ by Patrick Harpur.	2003-04-24

I'm glad that I finally got around to reading it since it is probably the most in-depth examination of Wicca that I've found.<br /> The author succeeds admirably in connecting the sacred core teachings of true, traditional, Wicca with the mystery cults of Greece and Rome. He also proves that Celtic influence, while important, was secondary- the origins of Wicca lie in the Mediteranian region, specifically &quot;Old Europe.&quot; I was amazed to find out about the influence of the Etruscans on the Celts (the belief in fairies originated with them!) I also see that the original &quot;Tuatha de Danaan&quot; were almost certainly Greek wanderers. Moreover, the Druids seem to have been heavily influenced by Greek thought, including the worship of Dionysos.<br /> I've always instinctually connected and included the classical mysteries, the cult of Dionysos, the Druids, and the religion of the Goddess together as a whole- but this book does a fine job, in my opinion, of formally demonstrating the historical connections.	2003-04-22

Ben Reitman was a hobo, medical doctor, anarchist, and social reformer of the early 20th century. This book reveals his world, a world that most history books tend to ignore- the world of the hobos and political radicals (they were often one and the same) of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is the world of \\"Hobohemia.\\" Much of this world centered around old time Chicago (the winter quarters for most hobos) and such institutions as the Hobo College, the Dill Pickle Club, and Bughouse Square. I know that one doesn't think of hobos discussing politics, economics, literature, and the arts, but that was a large part of their world. In many ways it reminds one of the world of the Beats during the 1950's- Jack Kerouac would have fit right in. In fact, considering the surprising prevalence of jazz,\\"free love\\" and recreational drugs, it uncannily prefigured the Beat scene.<br />The people that Reitman knew makes an impressive list: Emma Goldman, Jack Reed, Walter Lippman, Theodore Dreiser, Upton Sinclair, General Jacob Coxey, James Eads How (the \\"millionaire hobo\\") and Al Capone. The description of the many, now unknown, hobo philosophers is even more remarkable, for these were very remarkable men. These were free thinkers and intelligent and sensitive critics of the society around them. As for Reitman himself, I not only feel that I know him from reading this book, but I admire him and regret never actually meeting him.<br />Oh yes, while most of the men covered in this book were labeled as \\"radicals\\" by the authorities of their time, all they really wanted was to improve life for the average working man (the hobo was essentially a migrant worker) and make society a little fairer. For this they were persecuted, imprisoned, beaten, and often murdered. Some things never change....	2003-04-20

From reading Studs Terkel's _Working_ some years ago I knew that he was a perceptive and honest writer with a ground level understanding of working-class reality. This later work,however, is even better. In fact, it is the best, the most accurate and honest, book on present day American society that I've read.<br />Terkel interviews a wide range of typical Americans and shows the great economic, social, racial, political, and religious differences that separate us. The primary problem seems to be the huge and growing gap between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have-nots\\" (the book makes it clear that the only thing that most Americans are really interested in is money.) He also points out the extreme historical illiteracy of the younger generations that cuts them off from their own past.<br /> The most frightening part about the book is the almost sociopathic way in which the \\"haves\\" have of belittling the \\"have-nots.\\" People with money would literally rather see poor people starve in the streets rather than see one dime of their taxes spent on \\"welfare.\\" As the book points out, there's a meaness in the land that wasn't here in the thirties, and we're losing a feeling as a people.	2003-04-20

This book is a well chosen collection of excerpts from the writings of Frithjof Schuon, the preeminent expostor of the Philosophia Perennis in our times.<br /> Here in these selections you have the heart of the Perennial Philosophy that lies at the core of all legitimate religions and spiritual paths. The translation from the original French is good and flows smoothly and poetically.<br /> Central to all is the realization that the reason that humankind exists is for its individual members to transcend the material world and make connection with God. This is to find the center where heaven and earth meet. Deep contemplative prayer is prescribed as the best path to this center. Indeed, to the centered man, all of life becomes an ongoing prayer, a contemplation of the Divine. Moreover, after one finds the center, one is able to return to the outer world and put its dissonances into perspective, for they are nothing compared to the Absolute. Further, once true connection has been made, the material world becomes transparent and one sees the symbolic meaning and archetypes that are reflected in the mirror of matter.	2003-04-20

That is because most of it reads more like a novel than a formal academic study. This is done to put the reader into the overall cultural mindset of Alexandria and the library at various points in it's almost 1000 year history.<br />Having done my own research on this topic in college I can vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the author's research. The truth is that there is very little surviving hard data about this institution (and absolutely no surviving archeological evidence.) There is however an original revelation that the layout of the Museum may very well have imitated that of the Ramesseum at Thebes. This is due to the fact that the Greek rulers of the Ptolemaic period adhered closely to classical Egyptian forms- at least in a superficial and material manner.<br />This book clears up some popular misconceptions. First of all, there was no \\"library\\" as a separate institution or structure. It was always an inseparable part of the overall Museum. Secondly, the Museum was in no sense a secular institution. It was truly a temple to the Muses, and Holy Wisdom, with sacred functions. Even under Roman control it continued to be administered by a priest.<br />Finally, it would seem that the Romans had nothing to do with the burning of the Museum, indeed there was no damage during the Roman conquest. The greatest damage is shown to have been done in late antiquity at the hands of Christian fanatics- like so many simular of cases of the mindless destruction of our classical heritage.	2003-04-15

We are shown that the material world has a spiritual origin, for all of creation emanates down from the divine Source, through the various levels of manifestation, to our own world. Moreover, we are shown that mankind's ultimate goal is to turn away from the distractions of this lower material creation and seek union with this divine Source (God, the One, the Good.)<br /><br />While Plotinus critised the Gnostic sects of his day, it is obvious that his own idea of intuitive intellectual knowlege, where subject and object unite in perfect understanding, is pure gnosis. The main disagreement seems to have been on the nature of the material world: The Gnostics held it to be inherently evil, while Plotinus saw it as simply lower and inferior, yet basically good.<br /><br />This Penguin edition has a large and informative introductory section. It includes an excellent biography of Stephen Mackenna, the translator, who gave his life and health to this work. There is also a good brief historical sketch of late historical times to help the reader to understand the period in which Plotinus wrote. Plus, the brief, condensed, well-structured, outline of Plotinus' system of Philosophy is invaluable in getting an initial grip on the concepts that are expanded upon in the main work. Finally, Porphyry's brief contemporary biographical sketch of Plotinus is included.<br /><br />There is great wisdom in this book for those who can penetrate the traditional intuitive mindset. This only to be expected since Plotinus studied the perennial philosophy at the great library of Alexandria for over a decade. There is also the fact that Plotinus admitted to three episodes of enlightenment, epiphany, or cosmic consciousness in his life. Like all true masters, he was more of a receiver of timeless divine truths than an originator of anything new and contrived.ng new and contrived.	2003-04-13

This is because it will become immeasurably more to you. Indeed, the metaphysician and mathematician Guenon demonstrates the symbol of the Cross to be the fundamental key, model, and archetypical pattern to all of creation.<br />Briefly, the upper axis of the cross is shown to be the spiritual axis. This is the divine ray of emanation from the Source, it is the connection to the higher Self, the direction of divine attraction in spiritual evolution, the \\"will of heaven\\", and the connection between all possible worlds.<br />The horizontal axis is shown to be the created world, the plane of earthly life and existance, the stage on which the individual ego operates.<br />The intersection of the two axes is where \\"heaven and earth\\" meet. This is the point of divine influence. This is also the goal of the seeker, for to find this center is to merge your will with the will of heaven and obtain perfect harmony and\\"effortless action.\\"<br />Guenon demonstrates in detail the parallels of this model with that of the Cross of Christ, the World Tree, the Sephirotic Tree, the Net of Brahma, the Neoplatonic system of heavenly spheres, the Hermetic macrocosm and microcosm, the Hindu Gunas, the Taoist Yin-Yang, as well as many other cross-cultural relationships.<br />This study fits perfectly into the rest of the great edifice of Guenon's other work on the perennial wisdom. Numerous footnotes show one where to refer to his other books for further elaboration of various concepts.	2003-04-09

These tests can all be individually scored (or you can average them for a composite score.) The tests themselves have 5 sections covering mathematical ability, verbal ability, insight ability, creative ability, and spacial reasoning ability. This gives a somewhat more well-rounded assessment of your overall talents than most tests of this type. The scoring is unusual, since the faster you finish; the higher your final score. This makes it ideal practice for timed tests (such as that administered by Mensa.)<br />There is a section on test strategies and hints if you feel that you need them. As this booklet points out, &quot;automatization&quot; is the key for such tests, i.e., being so familiar with most types of questions that you can do them automatically, or at least not waste time trying to ascertain what the problem is asking for and how to approach it. This leaves more time for creative thinking once the mechanical details are mastered.<br />From my own experience, these are accurate tests. They correlated well with my score on the Mensa test, as well as the IQ conversions for the standardised tests that I've taken (PSAT, ACT, GRE.) In fact, it was this test that gave me the confidence to try for Mensa membership ( and later Intertel.)<br />There is a brief discussion of the history and value of intelligence testing, as well as, the different types of recognised intelligences (verbal, mathematical, musical, spacial, bodily kinesthetic, intrapersonal, and interpersonal.)

Here, in one book, is the actual gnostic and hermetic source material for your ready reference and deep contemplative study. One great benefit of such a one-volume text is that you cannot help but to see the common \\"golden thread\\" that runs through all of the great mystical traditions. From the Egyptian Hermetics, to the Manicheans, to the Essenes, to the Jewish Kaballists, to the Neoplatonists, to the Christian Gnostics- all these mystics were in Resonance with a higher common Source.<br />When you start to ponder these texts you will either find them to be obscure, nonsensical, and unreadable, or if you are ready, you will intuitively apprehend and \\"recollect\\" a great treasury of Wisdom emanating from the Source. It is all a matter of whether or not you have discovered that there is another higher, intuitive manner of gaining knowlege, other than the narrow analytical, materialist approach.<br /> If you are intrigued by this concept, you might find _The Only Tradition_ by Quinn to be informative, if not transformational.	2003-04-06

Yet, there definately is a correlation with these inner states and color preference.<br /> This is probably the easiest of the deep psychological tests to administer and interpret. It is not a game and is not to be used carelessly or improperly. In fact, I first heard about it in graduate school when I overheard one of the psychology professors go ballistic when he found that the undergraduates were administering the test to each other. He wasn't upset because he thought it was nonsense, on the contrary, he was upset because he knew it to be a deep and powerful tool with the potential to do great damage if misused.<br />One further warning, if you buy an older edition of this book make sure that: #1 the eight cards are included, and #2 that they are not too badly faded.<br />Oh yes, the text states that this test is still accurate even if you are color blind!	2003-04-06

While the author does thoroughly cover the various biblical interpretations of the End Times, she goes far beyond the various Christian perspectives. Here you also find Mayan, Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim, teachings equally considered. Moreover, prophets and prophecy from all ages are included, from the dawn of recorded history to contemporary times.<br /> It is truly fascinating how profoundly metaphysically advanced Traditional cultures such as the Greek, Indian and Mayan could come to quite simular concepts and timing on the great cosmic cycles...<br />As this book points out, Madam Blavatsky was also of the opinion that an end would come around the year 2000-but could be changed by more and more people becoming attuned to spiritual wisdom and guidance.<br /> The author's use and comparison of quotes from relevent source material is especially good.	2003-03-30

Even though the I.Q. contest that this book was written for is long over (the prize was awarded on July 31, 1986) it is still an interesting and informatve book.The text covers the distinction between I.Q. and intelligence, and the history of measurement. There is also a list of the estimated I.Q.'s of great historical figures (I \\"tied\\" with Newton, Rousseau, and Spinoza.) Plus, there is a introductory description of most of the high I.Q. societies in the world such as Mensa, Intertel, Triple Nine, The International Society for Philosophic Enquiry, The Prometheus Society, and the Mega Society. The contact addresses are also given should you decide to try for membership (I belong to two of them.) Lastly, the I.Q. quizes in the back are totally nondated and a good way to practice for the real thing.<br />Perhaps one of the reasons that this book holds up so well is that it was written by Marilyn Mach vos Savant (the most measurably intelligent person on earth.)	2003-03-27

This is because my soul has long resonated to its subject- the Philosophia Perennis, or the Perennial Philosophy. Some would say the primary subject of the book is really the lives of the two great metaphysicians and promulgators of the Tradition in the first half of the twentieth century, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy and Rene Guenon. While it  does deal with the lives and work of these giants, really, they were \\"merely\\" two of the modern vessels for this eternal Tradition. They themselves assigned the real importance of their work to the Tradition and downplayed any original contributions on their own part. Like all of us whose souls resonate to the vertical path of the Cross, of the World Tree or Axis Mundi, they primarily \\"recollected\\" these teachings in the Platonic or Gnostic sense. Coomaraswamy and Guenon were supremely aware of the true source of their inspiration.<br />  I'm sure there are many modern scholars and materialists that will try to read to this book only to come away with absolutely no understanding of it. That is because all such teachings are presented for those with the \\"ears to hear.\\" If you are ready, then you will intuitively understand what is meant by such terms as quantity and quality, indeed, you've probably known it for many years. Indeed, if you understand what is being discussed here you will no doubt understand the source works with minimal interpretation (the Gitas, Upanishads, the Tao te Ching, the Hermetica, the Gnostic Scriptures, etc.) You will also recognize false and dead academic interpretations of no real understanding.... To the quantitative, empirical, analytical, statistical-minded academics out there this will all be dismissed as self-referencing, hermeneutical, irrationality. However, you will know better in your heart of hearts, for you understand mystical insight and direct intuitive recognition of the underlying values, meanings, and perceptions of things. You know the difference between rational and suprarational understanding. You are steadily ascending the vertical axis of the Cross. You are becoming, through \\"recollection\\", the sage and teacher that you could never find among the sterile, dead ashes of the modern world of scientism.<br />  I personally found it enlightening that both Coomaraswamy and Guenon were initially highly accomplished in the sciences and mathematics. You see, they didn't reject the material world (the horizontal arm of the Cross), they just recognized that it was the lowest and most trivial part of Creation and instead chose to ascend the vertical arm of the Cross, towards man's last end, s'eternar....w the difference between rational and suprarational understanding.

I think it is my favorite because of the way it combines both fact and myth in an a blend that comes across exactly right. The introduction,as well as, the &quot;interludes&quot; between stories, are an excellent, readable history of the order, while the stories themselves cover the mythology and legend from many differing perspectives- from the founding of the order, to the present day, to the far future.<br />You get an good overall sense of what the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon (later, the Knights of the Temple) were really all about. These were men from all over Christiandom (and perhaps beyond) who were pledged to protect pilgrims and holy places with their lives and honor. The took a vow of absolute poverty- individual knights owned nothing. Any wealth the order amassed was put to the purpose of the protection of pilgrims- and later, all of the Christiandom. A measure of their success at fulfilling their original purpose  lies in the fact that, from humble pilgrims to kings, all knew that they could trust their lives, as well as, their last penny to the Templars. Even the infidels knew that Templars were honorable men, for they neither asked for, nor accepted ransom, nor would they retreat in battle (unless out-numbered by at least three-to-one, and even then only under direct orders.) It is said that even the famed Assassins feared and payed tribute to the Templars.<br />Of all the fictional stories in this collection, I would have to say that my favorite is &quot;Choices&quot; by Richard J. Woods. This tale gives the best sense of the overall character of individual Templars and the order. It also links the German mystic Meister Eckhart sympathetically with their tradition.<br />If you have a more esoteric inclination, it is also pointed out that the rule of seventy-two articles granted to the order was based at least partially upon the Essene Rule of the Master of Justice. Also, it is pointed out that the name of the idol that Templars supposedly worshiped (Baphomet) is actually a code for Sophia (Holy Wisdom.) It seems that tht Templars were &quot;lovers of Sophia&quot;, i.e. &quot;philosophers.&quot; Finally, it is pointed out that in certain traditions the order lives on- as astral knights with a &quot;mandate to protect the weak, right wrongs, restore what was lost, make whole the broken.&quot; Afterall, there is a reason that Wolfram von Eschenbach portrayed the Grail Knights as Templars....ter of Justice.

I found this to be the most comprehensive book on the subject of angels and related topics that I have ever seen. Whether you are approaching this subject from a biblical, historical, cross cultural, or esoteric viewpoint you should find most everything that you are looking for. Indeed, you will find much that you were not originally looking for. It is easy to find yourself absorbed for hours reading from subject to subject, seeing associations and connections that never occured to you before. I couldn't really see where the author was promoting any particular agenda or viewpoint- it all seemed pretty objective to me. Yet, the writing isn't in dry-as-dust academic style either.<br />The book itself is hefty 485 plus pages and laid out in dictionary form (though there is a well written introduction on the overall subject.) The illustrations are in black and white, but they are well-chosen, crisp, and plentiful.	2003-03-12

Here you have spelled out the rules and customs by which a duel is begun, when duelling is permissable, conditions for a duel, seconds, the actual conduct of the duel itself, and the finish of the duel. In addition to this, the author has admirably covered historical, cultural, and local variations. The variety of techniques and tools used in duelling are also described and illustrated.<br /><br /> This book sets straight modern misconceptions about this ancient practice. The duel is an affair of honor, between two men of honor. It is not a matter of ego gratification, it is simply the ultimate statement of whether or not a gentleman is willing to stand behind his words and actions no matter the consequences. There is also an unstated faith in the knightly ideal that the right must prevail in acts of single combat under the eyes of God. There should be no intimidation involved, for no duel can be fought without mutual consent. No one can be forced into a duel. To attempt to force, or shame, another into an affair of honor is an affront to honor itself and a cause for complete censure from polite society.<br />In the days when duelling was practiced, society tended to be much more civil. A gentlemen knew that he could be called to ultimate account for his words, therefore he did not speak carelessly. Moreover, unless proven otherwise, one knew that a gentleman's word was truly his bond. Gentlemen were also much more certain and thoughtful of their convictions, for they had to be sure if they truly believed in such convictions strongly enough to defend them if called upon to do so.	2003-03-11

This is one of the most frequently used and most deeply pondered works of my permanent collection. It is, in my humble opinion, the best single volume on the subject of symbols and symbolism written in modern times.<br />Symbolism is a sacred way of looking at the outer world. It is a way of connecting the outer and inner worlds. A materialist sees, let's say an eagle, and simply sees a bird, while a symbolist sees an eagle and sees a message, a lesson, or a sermon. To the symbolist, the eagle also represents height, spirit, the sun, nobility, power, the lion of the air, etc. The symbolist doesn't totally ignore the materialist and mundane aspect of the eagle, he just realises that there is immeasurably MORE behind it.<br />The introduction of this book is an excellent essay of the symbolist mind-set. It covers symbolism in platonic thought, hermetism, renaissance thought, alchemy, heraldry, dream symbolism, as well as, the views of Goethe, Saunier, Bele, Guenon, Eliade, Scheider, and, of course, Jung.<br />The body of the book is in dictionary form with concise but comprehensive descriptions of topics from a historic and multi-cultural viewpoint. This is assisted by the many excellent line drawings, as well as, two sections of carefully chosen black and white photographs.<br />This is a book of correspondenses, of resonance, of the common rythym that connects things with a higher, sacred place. You learn that there are immeasurable depths to creation- and that you have merely been skipping across the surface of that creation like a stone across deep waters....	2003-03-10

I truly wish that this book would have existed 30 or more years ago. Almost everthing traditionally written on this subject has been tacitly negative. The highly sensitive, or introverted, personality type was automatically assumed to be defective to some degree for their failure to \\"adapt\\" to the extroverted \\"norm.\\" I think that this is because most traditional American psychological thought has been fundamentally industrial and military psychology- the subject is always supposed to adapt to the environment and never the other way around. Those who cannot adapt are identified and disposed of. That is certainly how military psychology has always been practiced. This book is the first to demonstrate that highly sensitive people are both \\"normal\\" and have many valuable traits. Indeed, they excel against extraverts in most areas that make people truly \\"human.\\" Not only that, but in other cultures without an unnatural majority of extraverts, the sensitive person was seen as the ideal friend and citizen.<br /><br /> I especially appreciated the explanation of the biochemistry of \\"over-stimulation.\\" When sensitive people are forced to interact in unnatural evironments the cortisol levels in their bloodstream increases, making them even more sensitive to their environment than they usually are. Unless they can withdraw, or otherwise calm themselves, it is a virtual certainty that they will overreact. This means that they will act contrary to their usual conscientious, reasonable, and understanding normal behavior in order to escape. Needless to say, inspite of the fact that this reaction is virtually out of their control, this overreaction is dealt with harshly by society- and by employers. Inspite of the fact that highly sensitive people are the most conscientious, hard-working, competent, and even gifted, of employees 99% of the time, this absolute physical need to escape to a less stressful environment can ruin their lives. They are labeled as freaks, as not being \\"team players\\"- and as \\"unemployable.\\" I know this, for like the author, I was also born a HSP.

First of all, I am glad that a book was finally written on this topic, since it points out the hell most introverted and shy people go through trying to find, and keep, suitable employment. The unfortunate fact is that in our society extroverts are the great majority and they have structured most workplaces to fit their personality type. Let's face it, there are a lot of jobs that could be done quietly and privately if those in charge, and co-workers, would just let you alone to do your work.<br />As for the alternatives listed in this book, well, I have some familiarity with most of them:<br />1) Writer: it is extremely difficult to actually earn your living as a writer in today's world. The days when you had your choice of hundreds of magazines that you could submit to between books is long gone. I remember reading that most working writers do not even earn minimum wage for all the time that they put in. True, you could probably make it as a technical writer, but that means working closely with marketing and engineering types as a &quot;team&quot;, so why bother?<br />2) Artist: If you have the talent and drive, then go ahead. Chances are if you are truly an artist you couldn't live without creating art anyway. Once again however, actually paying the rent with it is something else. There is a reason that the phrase &quot;starving artist&quot; exists. You could become a commercial artist, but that also involves &quot;teams&quot; and marketing people, so why bother?<br />3) Research: This is only a  possibility if you have an advanced degree and tolerance for the academic world.<br />4) Computers: this is a very viable alternative if you have the training and aptitude. Much depends on your individual boss when it comes to how much independence you actually have.<br />5) Mail Carrier: every time I have looked into postal jobs I've gotten nothing but the run around. Most postal jobs seem to go to the friends and relatives of people already working for the Postal Service.<br />6) Park Ranger: Whenever I tried to obtain a job with the Bureau of Land Mangement for the last 30 years I have always been told that there was a &quot;hiring freeze.&quot; Even if you score highly on the rating scale of the Office of Personnel Management, a veteran or minority candidate can out score you easily with their &quot;bonus points.&quot;<br />7) Security: most security firms seem to want either military or police training and experience. The shy introvert is not their first choice.<br />If you want to try for any of these careers then more power to you. However, as this book itself points out- don't give up your day job.<br />What alternatives do I suggest?

In doing so, we see that true Wicca, and other simular traditions, have a legitimate claim to extremely ancient and profound practices dating back to the dawn of the race. The author shows parallels between the beliefs and practices in culture after culture (Mayan, Plains Indian, Siberian, Norse, Celtic, Chinese, Tibetan, Polynesian, Hindu, Greek, Etc.) He then shows connections with more historically recent traditions in Germany, Switzerland, France, Ireland, Italy, England, etc. I found it to be a magnificent and convincing synthesis.<br />I found it especially appropriate that a book about common roots should use the universal symbol of the World Tree as a starting point.<br />The author points out that when a society ceases to listen to the messages of the otherworldly dimension the results are always the same: listlessness, depression, addiction, inhumanity, and general malaise. This is the result of &quot;loss of soul.&quot; It is the natural function of the shaman to maintain the connection with the otherworld and to reclaim lost souls.<br />The next time a &quot;skeptic&quot; tries to minimalise the legitamacy and lineage of your spiritual path, you could do far worse than to refer this book to them. The connection between early Christianity and Shamanism is even explored (estatic states, speaking in tongues, spirit journeys to higher realms, helping spirits, crucifixion on the World Tree....)	2003-02-07

It is neither allegory, nor fact, nor fiction, but a reflection of the very nature of things. Nowhere have I found a work of fiction that shows a such a profound understanding and synthesis of Gnostic, Neoplatonic, Hermetic, Buddhist and Mayan philosophy.<br />As for the story itself, it takes place in the endtimes, the Kali Yuga, the age of iron. It is the ultimate outcome of a world of materialist, linear thinking- crumbling, poisioned, dying, and hopeless. The images are very reminiscent of William S. Burroughs and his _Cities of the Red Night_. Yet, even here and even now, a few individuals have the ability to transcend the veil for the good of all.<br />The title was apply chosen, for \\"Telos\\" is Greek for end, completion....or final causes and purpose. That is what this book is about the goals, ends, and purposes behind the cosmic cycles of the Indian Yugas, the great cycles of the Mayas, or of the Platonic Great Year.<br />There is more of real value in this slim volume (156 pages) than many writers put to paper in their entire careers with millions of empty words.	2003-02-01

I have mixed feelings about this book. It seems to assign much more power to evil spirits than they actually possess. To go to extremes of ritual and drama to exorcise evil spirits is to assign to them a degree of power that they do not wield. Yet, as the author points out, this approach is not exclusively Christian, or even western, for certain Buddhist sects have also practiced simular rituals. No doubt the practice preceeds any of the surviving major religions.<br /><br />I'm not denying that disincarnate evil actually exists, but it cannot hold power over you unless you are operating at the same low level. It is far better to contemplate the Good in creation. Evil spirits can only enter a heart, or a mind, if it is empty of Good to start with.	2003-01-28

This was the first of the Gor series- a series that stretched over 20 years and well over 20 books. Briefly, this is not a typical \\"sword and sorcery\\" book or series. Except for a little advanced alien technology, it is a world of ordinary (but archaic) technology- and extreme violence, brutality, and sexuality.<br />The story starts with Tarl Cabot, a well educated but cronically bored professor at a small east coast college. He finds himself transported by advanced alien beings to Gor, a world very much like earth, but on the opposite side of the sun. Here he finds out that he is part of a collossal alien breeding experiment to produce a super-race of humans in an environment of constant \\"survival of the fittest\\" warfare. Human technology is kept limited to classical or medieval levels to ensure that the humans aren't too efficient at slaughtering each other. The only consistently fantastic element are the giant birds that are used as saddle mounts- and very simular birds have now been found in the fossil record, so maybe they aren't that fantasic after all.<br />The society is purely one of might makes right. The governments are essentially tyranical- if there are assemblies, then only the upper classes have a say. The societies are rigidly class based (warrior class on top, then priests, scribes, artisans, farmers, slaves.) As for the slaves, there is more and more thinly disguised sadomasochism as the series progresses. In fact, that, and variations on the warfare and violence, are the main constants as the books move from various earth-like cultures from classical Greco-Roman, to Mongol, to Norse, etc., etc., etc.<br />John Norman was clearly a well educated man. I think he originally planned this series around a variation of Aristotle's ideal state. In the early books there are some inspiring scenes of heroism and nobility against extreme odds. However, there is a developing theme of social Darminism and survival of the fittest, and submission of the inferior, that is just pure Fascist pornography....<br />I'm sure if most parents would have known what was really in these books they would never have allowed them in their homes., that is just pure Fascist pornography....<br />I'm sure if most parents would have known what was really in these books they would never have allowed them in their homes.	2003-01-26

Sure Jack Kerouac had his problems with booze and relationships, but at his core there was somehow this absolutely blinding glare of innocent purity. Here was a man whose primary concerns were always the meaning of life, the nature of god, the suffering of innocents, whether he was boozing it up in a bar, hopping a freight, or hold up in a look-out cabin on top of a mountain. Jack Kerouac was a true poet in a world were poetry was in abysmal decline both before and after. Jack Kerouac's life was a spontaneous living poem- the dionysian poem of the living holy fool.<br />This is my favorite of all Kerouac's novels. I've had people comment about how I must have patterned a huge part of my early life on this book. I remember thinking so too, except all my wandering and wondering took place before I even heard of Jack or his books....	2003-01-24

I first read this Gem-like little book because Kerouac mentioned it in his _Dharma Bums_. I'm glad he did- this is one of the most profound and satisfying books that I've ever read. It is the book I tuck into my breast pocket when I'm totally fed up with civilization and just have to get away into the back country.<br />This is the finest example of the writings of the tradition chinese mountain man hermit. Yet, the chinese version of the hermit was most unlike the western pattern. These men didn't reject nature and the natural world to find the divine- they merged with it. These were men who could live life with an almost dionysian intensity complete with wine and wise cracks. These men could cut to the marrow of what is truly important in life. I'm sure old Han-shan must have driven Confusius and the imperial bureaucrats nuts....<br /><br />The last poem of the 101 states: \\"Do you have the poems of Han-shan in your house? They're better for you than sutra reading.\\" I couldn't agree more.	2003-01-24

Imagine a world without the concept of Superman. You quickly see that the Kryptonian is more than merely the most physically powerful of the world's heroes. Superman is the one constantly good and true fact in the world. He is the nail at the center of the moral universe. Without his example and leadership would the rest of the super-heroes have the will and determination to oppose and triumph over evil no matter the cost? That's what this Elseworlds tale explores.<br />I found this tale to be one of the all time best in the history of graphic novels. I rank it up there with _Kingdom Come_ and Millar's _Dark Knight_. It is also an eye opening story about team work and the importance of a true leader. You can have all the greatest individual talents in the world on an all-star team, but without that selfless team leader who inspires everyone to forget their own egos and agendas and to play for something greater than themselves, then the team will crumble when the going gets tough and ruthless.<br />Yeah, I liked this story alot.	2003-01-23

I've always had a good feeling about Sylvia Browne, and that good feeling carries over to this book. It has a definite ring of truth to it. The idea that we choose our own life path, themes, and challenges before we incarnate sounds especially truthful (we select the challenges that will produce the most growth and spiritual benefit for those around us.) However, if you are like me you may find yourself wondering just what you were thinking to have given yourself this many challenges....<br /><br />  Alot of the criticism of this book seems to center around it being too specific in its details of the other side. The thing to remember is that Browne has been given details and images that were meaningful and graspable for her. Since space and time are very, very diferent on the other side you can count on these specific images just being a mask for the true reality. Yet, upon saying this, I know that I have seen the building she calls the \\"Hall of Wisdom\\" in a very vivid dream....<br /><br />  The listing of the 44 life themes in the appendix is also very interesting and useful. You find yourself trying to identify the primary and secondary themes of everyone you know. In my own case I believe that it is #1 Spirituality and #2 Loner.<br /><br />  My only real criticism with the book concerns the discussion of suicide. From my observations the vast majority of suicides are victims- and God would NEVER punish someone that has already been victimized.	2003-01-22

If you are familiar with everything Jack Kerouac ever wrote, then this set is a great memory jogger. If you are new to his work it is a superb introduction. Or perhaps you've tried to read him but never got into his \\"flow of consciousness\\" style. Then, these recordings teach you how to hear him in your mind- as one long, sweet jazz riff. Just close your eyes and let him transport you to better times and better places. Of course, Kerouac's America is still out there, here and there, in forgotten corners, in special places and special people.<br /><br />  Kerouac was the soul of his age. Who else but Jack could go from commenting on Dostoeveky one minute, then switch to the Three Stooges without missing a beat? Or just as easily go from Sanskrit to skat. And it works. That is because a great soul can encompass entire worlds without contradiction....	2003-01-14

Here, he returns, one last time, to many of the favorite topics, characters, and settings of so many of his other books and stories. All in one book you have time travel, alternate dimensions, robots, a vast brotherhood of friendly aliens, a very dog-like wolf (ala City), not to mention many other familiar elements. It is all contained in a very complex, skillfully woven, unpredictable narrative.<br />It is fitting that that this book should address the issues of immortality, eternity, and the purpose of life. After all, it was written only two years before the author died (peacefully and in his sleep.) You find immortality achieved by means of fields that hold time at bay, by artificially becoming points of pure intellect, by evolutionary means, by intelligent machines, etc. There is also the understanding that mankind has infinite potential to grow in intellect and understanding. Indeed, it is clearly stated that without consciousness and understanding the universe would lack meaning. That is the ultimate purpose of all sentient beings- to give meaning to the universe.<br />This is a mature, thoughtful, science fiction novel. It is not an old style shoot-em-up space opera, though it does have some pretty good killer monsters in the pay of sinister aliens from the future.<br />All in all, I found this novel to be an excellent capstone to a distinguished career. The old magic never dimmed. I actually postponed reading this book, for I knew that there would be no more coming after I had finished this one....	2003-01-08

I appreciate books that set right distortions and falsehoods about the past. However, I do not appreciate books that seek to rewrite history by setting up new distortions and falsehoods. This is not an objective history with the purpose of \\"deconstructing\\" the popular image of the American golden age of the mid-twentieth century. I'm not sure why, but the author has a quite different agenda- to deny that the prosperity and stability of the period ever existed.<br />A big part of the author's argument seems to be that because the consumer goods of the present day are more advanced or affordable, then our lives must be so much better. He makes the arguement that because so many households have color television and VCR's then we live in a paradise. The grim fact that the standard of living has continuously fallen for the average working person since 1973 is ignored. The fact that it now takes two wage earners working overtime to barely keep the same household standard of living that a single wage earner could maintain on 40 hours a week is ignored.<br />There is also no mention of the fact that all the superior consumer goods that the author values so much are for the vast majority of cases not made in the United States by decently paid American workers, but are almost always made out of the country by virtual slave labor. American workers usually can only find low paid retail jobs selling these goods....<br />Even in recalling the social unrest and protests of the 60's and 70's the author ignores the basic fact that everyone still believed that change for the better was possible. People only go out in the streets to protest or picket if they still have faith in the system. In these days of corporate control of both parties no one even bothers to protest- they know that the deck is callously stacked against them.<br />Yes, the purpose of this book is to mislead people into denying the basic historical, statistical fact that the standard of living was higher for a larger percentage of the total population in the 40's, 50's, and 60's than at any other time in history. The current huge and growing gulf between haves and have nots did not exist for income distribution was much more equitable. The author seems to be trying to make people more tolerant of the current unjust status quo by denying that the recent past was any better.<br />I am just not sure if the distortions in this book are the result of denial- or a deliberate attempt falsify the record.

Lovecraft. If you finish this single volume you will be familiar with the atmosphere and the terminology of a large part of the Cthulhu Mythos. That's probably why this particular edition has remained in print so long. After _The Dunwich Horror_, it was my introduction to Lovecraft.<br />In the first story, &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;, you find yourself immediately immersed in the world of the Necronomicon, Miskantonic University, and the cosmic pantheon of the Cthulhu Cult and the Elder Things.<br />The second tale, &quot;The Shunned House&quot;, shows what the master could do with a more conventional horror story. It is one of the best stories of a cursed house and family ever written.<br />The third story, &quot;Dreams in the Witch House&quot;, serves as an excellent introduction to the cursed city of Arkham, though there are also strong elements of Miskantonic, the Necronomicon, and the speculations of fourth dimensional connections between our own world and &quot;the farthest stars of the transgalactic gulfs.&quot;<br />Finally, there is &quot;The Statement of Randolph Carter&quot;, which may be the most perfect short horror story ever written.<br />Of course if you are really hooked and want all the details about Lovecraft's world, then get the _Encyclopedia Cthulhiana_, that is if you are lucky enough to find a copy....	2002-12-29

This seemingly light and trivial book covers some extremely heavy and profound concepts. In fact, it is amazing how well a few pictures, diagrams, and cartoons can clarify concepts better than chapters of dense text from more \\"scholarly\\" sources. Of course, if the pictures don't do it for you, there is the excellent commentary by Fred Allen Wolf, as well as, an extensive bibliography for further reading.<br />I've lost track of how many times I've read this little book since it first started to crack open my narrow Newtonian mind-set back in the '80's. It is an especially good book to read just before going to sleep- the subconscious loves to process this level of material. Here is the best introduction to not only the probably structure of the universe of space-time, but to what lies beyond it. You get very interesting speculations on the nature of paranormal phenomena, reincarnation, the nature of archetypes and the mythological level of perception, survival after death- all of which conventional \\"science\\" choses to reject or ignore.<br />I especially enjoyed the discussion of how quantum waves can affect all levels of existance simultaneously at different scales of organization from sub-atomic, to the natural world of normal perception, to the human mind, to the stellar and galactic level. It adds new significance to the ancient maxim, \\"As above, so below.\\" This is especially true when you consider that human consciousness helps function as a co-creator of the perceived material world ( along with our higher Selves beyond space-time.) In fact, the purpose of existance seems to be to reunite ourselves with ourselves so that all of creation may become fully aware of itself in harmony.<br />Yeah, I know it sounds pretty \\"hippy-dippy\\", that is it does until you begin to seriously contemplate the true nature of things....	2002-12-29

Whenever I used to get too depressed with the meaningless, material, clock-work universe I used to read this book. It reminded my that there is far more to the universe than the scientists and accountants would have us believe.<br /> It wasn't that the &quot;coincidences&quot; were so incredible or improbable that inspired me, it was the fact that so many of them were meaningful. It is impossible to explain them without positing a benevolent intelligence to the universe. If these 150 excellently documentd cases are not enough to convince you, there is an excellent bibliography for further reading.<br /> I've heard it said that it is not uncommon for clusters of coincidences to sudden pop up around a person when they start reading about synchronicity. All I know is that if I went through my own personal journals for the last decade, I could easly come up with 150 more cases of 2nd, 3rd, 0r 4th degree synchronicity in my own life. An example of 3rd degree synchronicity would be finishing a book on an obscure topic, then setting it aside and turning on the television only to find that same topic being mentioned (first degree.) Then later on a friend brings up exactly the same topic out of the blue (2nd degree.) Then still later you are browsing in the library or book store and you unexpectedly flip to the same subject unintentionally (3rd degree.) It usually concerns a meaningful topic- at least to you. Of course sometimes the meaning seems to lie in the event itself as a kind of &quot;tap on the shoulder&quot; that there is more to the universe than you are letting yourself imagine.<br />The section on the nature and meaning of synchronicity is also excellent- this is far more than a simply &quot;believe it or not&quot; compilations of stories. The author suggests that in a way we, or our higher Selves, may somehow be co-creators when it comes to patterning the ground of existance. Of course, he also insists that we should also use cool logic, as well as our inner feelings, to interpret and act upon synchronous episodes.lings, to interpret and act upon synchronous episodes.	2002-12-29

I reread both this novel, as well as, the original _Time and Again_, in order at the same time. I was amazed at how well the two books flowed into each other almost seamlessly. I noticed no lack on continuity or deterioration of narrative or style. Simply put, I loved the first book, and this sequel is every bit as good.<br /><br /> Of course, I might be biased here. Finney develops a theme that I've toyed with for years, namely, how much better the 20th century would have been for the vast majority of mankind if WWI never would have occurred. Think about it, no WWI means no Soviet Union, no Nazi Germany, no defacto American Empire.... Moreover, there most probably would have been no overriding pressure to develop an atomic bomb. Things would have flowed along much more orderly and civlized lines. For that matter, Palestine would still be under the firm control of the Ottoman Empire.<br /><br /> It is somewhat eerie to read the main characters discussing the first book. Several times I have been tempted to search Manhattan for a Beekey Bros. warehouse....<br /><br />  As for those that hold that it is totally unbelievable that the government could ever establish any thing as preposterous as The Project, well, I guess they never heard of a little military intelligence project called Project Stargate with a directive to develop mental techniques to transcend time and space. Of course back in 1970 when Finney wrote the first book there was no Project Stargate- or at least no public knowlege of it.	2002-12-28

This one of those remarkable books that I stumbled upon by accident that turned out to be among the best that I have ever read. Finney has created a remarkable sort of book that recreates the atmosphere of another time more completely than any other book that I know of. Most writers when telling of other times simply use a variation of their own modern experience and add a few period details. Finney actually puts you in the mind-set of the 1880's. Somehow, you just KNOW that he got it right.<br /> I'm rereading this book after many years as a treat. I remember when I first read it I was disturbed that the time travel was accomplished without a machine. Now that I've read more extensively on the topics of physics and mysticism (most notably Ouspensky's _Tertium Organum_) I realise that the past, and future, are really there. It is just current limitations of the human mind that keep us from seeing them....	2002-12-25

First of all, let me state that I like and admire Gore Vidal. I find his political and social essays to be perceptive. Indeed, there are few modern political and social critics as perceptive, as brilliant even, as Gore Vidal. That is exactly why this book does not work.<br /><br /> Mr. Vidal has transplanted the 20th century, or at least the Industrial Age, mindset to the 5th century B.C. To put it mildly, this is a mistake. The men of that time did not think purely in political, materialistic, amd egoistic terms. These were people who actually believed, if not in the gods, then in the great Cosmic Mystery behind the gods. They actually believed in signs, portents, and oracles. After all, the 5th century B.C. was the time of the birth of many of the great teachings that would shape the entire world- east and west. These teachings sprang from deep inner wellsprings of the collective soul of Man, and not from petty squabbling between individuals and empires. Mr. Vidal reduces this to a tiresome, tawdry, political and materialist soap opera. Instead of capturing the feverish excitement of a time that gave birth to a new world, he instead manages to impose the jaded cynicism of the modern age on those times.<br /><br /> Even the classical Greece, where the story begins, celebrated the great Mystery religions, and both Socrates and Plato had profoundly mystical sides to their philosophies. Mr. Vidal's classical Greece comes across as located somewhere within the Beltway of Washington D.C. The Persians actually believed in the great cosmic struggle of Good and Evil as espoused by Zoroaster. The main character in this novel is a direct relative of Zoroaster, yet he seems to write off that great religion as simple fire worship and soma-induced hallucinations. In India, above all, it was union with the Divine, that most obsessed men over the concerns of the illusion of the \\"real\\" world, of Maya. Mr. Vidal's India comes across as a totally jaded, materialistic place full bad stereotypes of lazy and incompetent Rajas laying around the palace fixated on plotting and debauchery. As for China, well, the emphasis here is not on Lao Tzu and the great Taoist mystical philosophy, but on the shallow and moralistic teachings of Confucius. Oh yes, while both Buddhism, and the religion of the Jains, are touched upon briefly, they are dismissed as \\"madness.\\" This in itself shows a complete lack of understanding of the ancient world, a world where madness was viewed as a wondrous and sacred thing (i.e. being \\"touched\\" by the Gods.)<br /><br /> All-in-all, if you know anything about the history, philosophy, and religions of the 5th century B.C. this is a painful novel to read. I kept being reminded of how the \\"Flintstones\\" transplants the mid-20th century mind-set to the stone age. However, here Mr. Vidal wasn't trying to be funny....<br /><br /> Had the people of this time really thought in the narrow terms that this novel imposes upon them, both eastern and western civilization would not have flowered- they would have shortly withered away.lazy and incompetent Rajas laying around the palace fixated on plotting and debauchery.

The first thing to remember about this book is that it is not really a serious history of Dixon, even though the author may imagine himself to be some sort of historian. What this really is, is a nostalgic, &quot;feel good&quot; book for the people who run the town. You will not get any picture at all of real living conditions for most of the people who have lived and worked there over the years. This is because they were often poor southerners, immigrants, and blacks- and as such, they were never considered to really be part of the town....<br /> Yet even when it concerns the sugar-coated basic history of the town, the author makes embarassing mistakes and ommissions that show that no real research went into this thing.	2002-12-21

This is one of those great Books that has suffered because of a lack of readership capable of comprehending it. If one has the left brain traits necessary to grasp the transfinite logic and mathematics, then the mystical implications are ungraspable. And if you have the right brain intuition to understand the mystical implications, then you often struggle with the logic and mathematics. This book requires a reader with not only a first rate mind, but also a balanced one.<br />To briefly abstract the primary thesis: time is really motion in extra dimensional space. This is profound, for Ospensky was the first to actually point towards where an actual, physical fourth dimension can be found. Our brains confuse this dimension with time. It can be split off from time with an adjustment, or evolution, of consciousness. You see, this represents the next huge leap in understanding the nature of the universe and reality. Just as Newton's undefined quantity of &quot;gravity&quot; was shown to actually be curved space, so does Ouspensky show Einstein's undefined quantity of &quot;time&quot; to be motion through higher physical dimensions.<br />If you want a book that will challenge you, this is it.

I still marvel at how Prabhavananda and Manchester managed to encapsulate so much of the core content and meaning of the twelve principle Upanishads in such a slim volume. Yet they did- and it works. This translation was originally produced in 1948 for the Vedanta Society of Southern California but it still holds up as one of the best. I have reread this book more times than I can remember- and yet I still reach new realizations in the interwoven, holographic whole. It isn't dogma or theology- it is the direct experience of saints and seers who have touched on divine union transcendent of time.<br /><br />_Of course if you truly understand these oldest of mystical scriptures then you could condense them down still further to:<br /><br />Brahman is true, the world is false,<br /><br />The soul is Brahman and nothing else.<br /><br />_Or if that is a bit wordy for you, then you can sum up the Upanishads, and all the Vedas, with: \\"Tat tvam asi\\" (Thou art that.)<br /><br />_Most people need to work up to the true understanding of these statements with a bit more commentary, however....	2002-12-18

This excellent little volume passes the biggest test of a great children's book, namely, it also holds the interest of the adult reader. This is because these are the timeless, classic myths and folk tales of India. In fact, if you wanted to start to  understand Indian culture, you could do far worse than to start with this book. Here you will finally understand why Ganesh has the head of an elephant. You will learn just who Rama and Krishna are, and how they relate to Vishnu. For that matter you will understand the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. The heroic monkey king, Hanuman is also introduced and explained. If you would like to go on to understanding and appreciating the Mahabharata, then this is also an excellent starting point, for the Pandava princes are introduced.<br /><br /> The first story in this collection is \\"The Monkey Bridge to Lanka.\\" I am still suprised at the power and wisdom contained in this brief tale. That is the wonderful thing about all these stories- you can interpret them at many different levels of meaning.<br /><br />I have truly come to love this little gem of a book.	2002-12-18

First of all, as I stated in my review of the original book, it would be fairly easy to fool me. I am not a cryptographer, nor a statistician, nor a reader of Hebrew, nor a scholar of the Torah. Yet, after reading this book all the way through, it still has the nagging feeling of truth to it.<br />This would seem to be the \\"sealed book\\" mentioned in Isaiah.<br />The author hammers home his warning of atomic terrorism in 2006, as well as, the fact that we are in \\"the end of days.\\" He also includes the code table that covers all the details of the September 11th attacks. Plus, the other code matrixes dealing with bin Laden are included. He even includes incredibly relevent and accurate matrixes dealing with recent U.S. politics.<br />However, the truly mind boggling revelations deal with what he has found concerning the \\"code key\\" and its origins. It may sound too fantastic to be believed, until you reflect that it is in agreement with the published views of Sir Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the DNA helix.....<br /><br />  While I have an absolute certainty in my own mind that God exists, I have no use for organized religion, so I have no fundamentalist ax to grind. I have a couple technical degrees and have worked in engineering, so I do not think that I am a totally credulous dupe. I've even obtained the software to test it myself. There is something here. I can't see how anyone with even a half-way open mind can simply dismiss it (unless you are a \\"fundamentalist\\" materialist.) Indeed, from what I've read of some of the critical reviews, it is obvious from their statements that the authors have not actually read either book, or if they did, they were incapable of following the technical side of the arguement.<br />  As I stated before, if it does turn out that this is an elaborate hoax it will not shake my beliefs.

This work is often described as Kant's most \\"mysterious\\". The mystery lies in the fact that here in this treatise the Great Professor of Metaphysics unreservedly admits in the existance of \\"immaterial natures in the world\\", i.e. spirits and a spirit world. There is nothing mysterious about this statement, it is just that modern readers refuse to accept it. I've never understood why this should be so hard for some, since Kant's System of critical idealism is perfectly consistent with this view. Kant claimed that we could never know the true nature of the world around us, the true causes of sensations. He always held that there is a real world that we can never accurately know. This real world corresponds with a \\"spirit world\\", or if you prefer, a platonic world of Ideals lieing outside of our human perception of time and space. Kant unmistakably states that \\"We should ... regard the human soul as being conjoined in its present life with two worlds at the same time....\\" Nothing could be more unambiguous, especially considering his references to the writings of Swedenborg.<br /> I think that this book has been largely ignored because it is just too divergent from the rational empiracism of the modern scientific mind. The scienitfic materialist conveniently ignores the fundamental questions of material \\"reality\\" that Kant couldn't ignore. Furthermore, when the Prussian government banned this work it set into motion the series of events that culminated in the profound physical and spiritual disasters of the 20th cetury- and beyond.<br /><br /> It may yet be proven that the ideas in this forgotten book are far more \\"real\\" than the modern materialist concensus of reality....	2002-12-09

In fact, I wonder if I was really all that well educated before I found it. Inspite of the fact that I was a university honors graduate I found that this book covered a whole universe of new ideas for me. Perhaps this is because I majored in one of the physical sciences and almost everything covered was from the narrow viewpoint of materialism and logical positivism.<br /> I especially enjoyed the organization of the book. Each chapter covers a major topic: the nature of the universe; man's place in the universe; what is good and evil; the nature of god; fate versus free will; the soul and immortality; man and the state; man and education; mind and matter; ideas and thinking; and recent approaches to philosophy. The individual philosophers, from classical to modern, addressing the issue are listed right under the chapter heading, then each of their arguements is presented in order. You can't help but start to compare them- to start thinking for yourself at a significant level.<br /><br />Since first reading this volume I've gone on to read more detailed works by the philosophers who appealed more to me such as Plato and Schopenhauer. Indeed, this book opened a whole intellectual world to me that my public university education totally ignored. I find myself wondering if a life lived without serious reflection of the topics presented here is really a life worth living....	2002-12-03

It captures the overall atmosphere of the entire series (fans will recognise and appreciate the many references to past characters and plot lines.) There is a well written introduction by the author Roger Zelazny.<br />The character of John Gaunt (a.k.a. Grimjack) is a complex one. He is one part film noir detective, one part Venetian bravo, one part western gunfighter- and all with an otherworldly edge. Yet I think the entire character can be summed up by the fact that he voluntarily walked out of the afterlife (or \\"heaven\\") to return to earth to help his friends. He did this even though he was warned that he could never return and that he would be doomed to wander the earth in reincarnation after reincarnation until the end of time....<br /> This graphic novel deals with a central period in Grimjack's life- the aftermath of the Demon Wars. He fought on the side of humankind (as one of the legendary Demon Knights) against the hoards of hell when they nearly engulfed the totality of the multiverse. Yet, he ultimately could not protect the one world that he loved the most....<br /> The art work by Flint Henry is something special- it reminds you of both the original underground comic books, as well as, the work of an inspired tattoo artist.	2002-12-03

It is inaccurate and an injustice. It is a strange sort of fanatic that hates the inquisition and the witch hunters, as much as, he does necromancers and murderers. Kane is in the ancient British and Irish tradition of a man who goes forth to wander the world after he receives the call- guided solely by his deep inner trust in his God. That is why he can walk the dark and wild places of the earth unscathed. That is why monsters and devils hold no terror for him. He simply trusts in the Lord to guide him to where he can do the most good.  Kane is a Puritan in the original sense of the word, a single individual that has no tolerance for corruption whether it exists in the World- or the Church. He doesn't preach, for he doesn't need to- his actions, and his sword, speak for him.  He needs no priest to mediate between himself and his Creator. Kane has gone beyond faith, for his is the sure and implacable knowledge that God exists. This is what makes him such a dangerous foe- you can't scare him and you can't make a deal with him. He obeys only the inner voice that guides him. I can see why the weak and corrupt would paint such a man as a fanatic.<br /> Solomon Kane was Howard's first creation. In my opinion, he was also his best. There is an element present here that is missing from the later characters- something higher.	2002-11-26

M. Bucke and P. D. Ouspensky	Books	5	17	17	N	Y	"Our time is really motion in extra dimensional space."	\\"Our time is really motion in extradimensional space.\\" This is a deceptively simple sentence, yet it speaks worlds. I have been reading everything available on the concept of a physical 4th dimension (as opposed to a mathematical abstraction) for two decades now. This book is not only the best summary- but it is the first in ages to break new ground.<br /><br />  The basic premise here is that we (and literally everything else) are 4th dimensional entities intersecting with a 3 dimensional world. A profound correlary to this is: just because we no longer intersect does not mean that we no longer exist.<br /><br /> The author addresses the subject on all levels- subatomic physics, cosmology, consciousness, and \\"unexplainable\\" phenomenon. His tie-in with the \\"perennial philosophy\\" is especially elegant. Of course, if you prefer hard science, then the revelation that Cerenkov radiation represents an \\"optic boom\\" analogous to a sonic boom is worth the price of the book- at least to me it was.<br /><br /> Not only is a tight case made for the existance of a 4th dimension made, but a reason and a purpose is stated for why we are just now becoming aware of it in significant numbers- survival pressure and evolutionary response. It is pointed out that on almost every level ours is a threatened civilization, indeed a threatened planet. 4th dimensional perception results in an expanded consciousness that transcends petty materialism and leads to a spirit of unity and interconnectedness (since everything IS really connected to a greater whole.) More importantly, it represents somewhere to exist if we do manage to render this planet uninhabitable.<br /><br /> This is the most significant book that I have reviewed in years- perhaps ever. I've read just about everything of significance in the bibliography. The author knows what he is talking about.	2002-11-22

I have always suspected that this penultimate novel of Hesse's plays upon the myth of the Most Honorable Order of the Rosy Cross in certain German intellectual circles. Even today you can get an arguement, either way, about the existance of the Rosicrucians and Christian Rosencreutz. This is fitting, since even the protagonist (H.H.) is left wondering if the League that sent him forth on his quest really ever existed or if he hallucinated it all.<br /><br />At the begining H.H. has no doubt what-so-ever in the existance or purpose of the ancient League. He sets forth on the journey to the East with his brother members in pursuit of the Tao, Kundalini, and the other Eastern mysteries. In short, they are seeking union with the divine. Even when some member drops out during the quest and \\"takes the railroad back\\" to the mundane world, they simply bid him farewell and continue on, unshaken in their own faith. They travel on through time, myth, poetry, and magic towards their goal.<br /><br />It is at the gorge of Morbio Inferiore that everthing unravels. It is here that the loyal servant Leo suddenly departs and the expedition falls apart in squabbling over trifles. Morbio Inferiore is the dark night of the soul. It is also the historical cataclysm of WW1. You see, before the Great War Germans could still believe in magic, Mozart, and Goethe, after the war all magic and innocence were dead. All that remained was cynicism, machines, and monsters.<br /><br />H.H. is suddenly left alone wondering if the League ever really existed or if it was a dream. He searches and searches for the lost servant Leo- only to be surprised at what he eventually finds....<br /><br />Ultimately we end up at the realization that despair serves a purpose in our own journey through life. For if we are still capable of despair then we must still, deep down, still believe in innocence, virtue, and justice. You cannot deeply mourn what never existed- somewhere, sometime!	2002-11-16

You've got to go forth and learn these lessons yourself. It is the same archetypical patterns, with variations, over and over.<br /><br /> I remember that when I first read this story it confused me that the Buddha and Siddhartha were two separate persons.

I have a shelf full of astrology texts and references, yet it is surprising how often I reach for this little book- primarily because I can quickly locate a topic which is buried in other larger, more \\"serious\\" tomes. Sure there are a lot of glossy, thick, \\"everything you wanted to know\\" books on astrology out there, but are you REALLY going to get around to reading one cover-to-cover? On the other hand, this little heavily illustrated introduction is written with intelligence and humor, and you'll finish in an evening or two.<br /><br /> I suppose my favorite part of the book is how it explains clearly that the planet represents the energy source, the constellation or sign is the filter that this energy must pass through, and the house is the area of influence in our lives. If you can keep this straight, then you have come a long ways.<br /><br /> This book is not going to teach you how to erect a natal chart. You really should go to a certified astrologer at least once in your life to have a natal (birth) chart done. That way, if you decide to learn how to do it yourself, you will have the professional chart to check your results against.	2002-11-16

The basic premise of this book is that a physical Fourth Dimension exists (as opposed to a mathematical abstraction.)<br /> This fourth dimension provides an explanation for most paranormal phenomenon (synchronicity, spirit communication, movement of objects through space and time, automatic writing, deja vu, clairvoyance, dowsing, etc.) The human mind has the ability to percieve this higher dimension (at least briefly) but it has to bypass a natural built-in &quot;censor&quot; that evolution has erected to keep us from being distracted at a three dimensional level of perception and survival. Indeed, if we were to totally eliminate this censor our brains might very well be overwhelmed by an all-seeing, all-knowing God-like state that we just are not ready to handle either mentally or spiritually. However, it may be that our higher Self (as opposed to our physical brain) is naturally a fourth dimensional entity.<br />This is the best book on this subject that I have found, it is a step beyond even Rucker's work.	2002-11-14

I am glad that I read this book because it reminded me that Anne Rice is not just a great writer of the supernatural and gothic, she is simply a great writer, period. There is nothing of the supernatural here, yet it is perhaps the most horrifying, at least for a male, of any of her books. As a measure of the effect of this book upon me, I kept reading it even after I realised what the main theme was (I had no idea when I started reading.) Not only that, but music is probably the biggest gap in my education- and yet, she not only made me appreciate it, but I actually felt like an insider in that world.<br /><br /> For the first time in ages, I actually felt myself totally caught up in the atmosphere of a book.

That's because this is what it is, common sense, and not the wild-eyed radicalism some people claim it is. Indeed, I read this book by constantly comparing it to the people and events I have known all my life in the middle west. In every case, I found that it all had a ring of truth, it all seemed &quot;true to type&quot; with the sort of people I've dealt with for the last five decades. This is in stark constrast with most histories, where I begin to wonder just what country is being discussed, because it sure ain't the one I grew up in....<br /> Maybe it is because our family has some American Indian blood, but we've always known that the &quot;official government version&quot; of anything was usually moonshine....	2002-11-13

While I believe that I have read most of the Sackett novels, this first one was always my favorite. It is definately the most unusual of the series, indeed, of anything that I've read by Louis L'Amour.<br /> Set in 1599, it is the story of Barnabas Sackett, founder of the Sackett clan in the New World. The Sacketts were fenmen (swamp men) eeking out an existance farming the little good land available to them, fishing for eels, smuggling, or going off to fight in the wars. It was the combination of the chance finding of a cache of Roman gold, along with a fight with an arrogant aristocrat, that put young Barnabas on the road to &quot;adventure.&quot;<br /> Fleeing to London, he meets the contacts that he will need to set sail for a new world and a new life. The sword fights, pirates, and sea battles that follow are not what you expect in a &quot;western&quot;, but they are quite good never-the-less. Upon surviving to reach America (after Roanoke, but before Jamestown) Barnabas rapidly sizes up the territory and the inhabitants and resolves to start his family there- far from kings and aristocrats. When he hears of the &quot;far blue mountains&quot; from the Indians that he is trading with, he makes up his mind to one day travel to them- and beyond.	2002-11-13

This is the best reference that I have found for putting one's self into the true 19th century mindset. The illustrations are especially good (the author was the founder of the Bettmann Archive.)<br /><br /> Most people think that they know this period from romantisized Hollywood films, but they really don't. Imagine a 3 mile-per-hour world. Imagine a world where, except for a handful of streets with gas street lamps, the biggest cities went almost totally black after night fall. Imagine a world with no telephones, no data bases, no social security numbers, no fingerprint files- where if you move to a different neighborhood and assume a new identity it is very unlikely that you will ever be discovered. Imagine a world where there is little communication between police precincts in the same city, let alone between cities. And the police that do exist are of the most unprofessional and rudimentary sort- and primarily interested in collecting graft and protecting the rich. Now imagine workplaces where there are no health and safety laws, no minimum wage laws, and where people put in at least 12 hours a day at the most soul-killing menial labor. Imagine gangs of children roaming the streets out of control because their parents are in the mills 12 hours a day- or just abandoned them because they don't earn enough to feed them. Imagine the great cities surrounded not by suburbs, but by rings of smouldering garbage dumps and shanty towns. This isn't the Third World- this was America only a century ago.<br /><br /> Oh yes, and if you think that farm life was much better- think again....<br /><br /> No wonder all we have are romantisized stories of the \\"good old days.\\" No wonder our great grandparents didn't talk much about those days....	2002-11-08

Personally, while I liked this one too, I would probably rank it after the Superman, Captain Marvel, and Batman books. Don't get me wrong, it is an excellent read- and the quality of the artwork is magnificent. There is just something better about the other three books.<br /><br /> I think the problem may be the one that the Amazon Princess herself faces in the storyline- she is just too darn perfect- and it intimidates people. After all, this is a perfect demi-goddess created out of the earth of Themyscira itself by the power of the gods. She is inhumanly perfect because, technically, she is not quite human. She is an Ideal made flesh- and that can be hard to identify with. Indeed, over and over, her shere power and presence overwhelms those she is helping as much as the bad guys- especially if they come from cultures that repress and dominate women. That's a hard character to infuse with the simple humanity of the other books....<br /><br />  As with the other three books, the original art work of this one was auctioned off for charity (this time it was for the victims of 9-11 and their families.)	2002-11-03

This is a sanitised, romanticised, look at Ronald Reagan's \\"home town\\" (note: he was not actually born there.) It is written by an unabashed Reagan worshipper- see his _Ronald Reagan's Crusade_.<br /><br /> Having been born and raised in Dixon, Illinois I really don't know where to start.

Howard's tales of Bran Mak Morn, last king of the Picts, have long been recognised as some of the first, and best, heroic fantasy ever written. That's certainly how I reguarded them, fantasy. Then I began to notice some curious parallels between current research into the the lost Atlantian civilization and Howard's stories.<br /><br /> First of all, there does indeed seem to have been a high stone age seafaring culture in the area we now call the Carribean approx. 10,000 years ago. This culture also seems to have had regular contact with both North and South America, as well as, the Mediterranian region. Now the ancestors of the Picts are thought to have come from the Mediterranian region during the high stone age. This small, dark race is thought to have spread over all of the British isles, as well as, a good part of Europe. They were only displaced by the coming of the Celts. Some experts believe that the Basques may be the only modern recognisable remnant of this people.<br /><br />  Now, the contact between the Carribean and Mediterranian, seems to have been suddenly disrupted a little over 8,000 years ago by a collossal comet shower over North America and the Carribean. It is documented that there was an abrupt climactic change and flooding at this time. There would almost certainly have been tidal waves in the Carribean region before this. In fact, it was only recently recognised that the \\"serpent\\" imagery found in much high stone age art probably represents \\"cosmic serpents\\"- or comets.<br /><br /> Now, Howard has his Bran Mak Morn making claims that his ancestors: 1.) were connected with Atlantis, 2.) knew of North and South America, 3.) ruled most of Europe, 4.) were driven out by the Celts, and 5.) have a strong religious connection with a destructive serpent cult. Not only that, but the physically degenerate stature of his Picts are what would be expected of a cut-off remnant of a race that was surrounded by nothing but enemies. Interbreeding, and lack of a sufficient gene-pool, would produce just the abnormalities and degeneracy that Howard attributes to his Picts.<br /><br /> To verify all this for yourselves, try reading _Gateway to Atlantis_ by Andrew Collins. You'll never see the fiction of Robert E. Howard in the same light again....nt gene-pool, would produce just the abnormalities and degeneracy that Howard attributes to his Picts.

Of course, academics will automatically reject it, but I can remember when these same \\"experts\\" rejected the \\"far-out\\" theories of continental drift and Mesozoic species extinction by asteroid impact.<br /><br /> Briefly, the evidence for a high stone age Carribean civilization existing over 10,000 years ago with contact with North and South America, as well as, the Mediterranian region is put forth. He draws from not only written records and legends but also from a surprising amount of physical evidence (i.e. tobacco and cocaine traces in the tissue of Egyptian mummies, and amphora showing up in ancient ship wrecks in the \\"new\\" world.)<br /><br /> Moreover, he shows how the catastrophic destruction of this culture can be attributed to a collossal comet shower over North America and the Carribean over 8,000 years ago. This would not only have produced tidal waves in the region, but evidence shows a sudden world-wide climactic change and flooding at this time.<br /><br /> At least sporadic contact seems to have continued between the two hemispheres well into classical times via the secretive Phoenicians and Carthaginians.<br /><br /> This isn't empty, quasi-mysitical, speculation. An extremely good case is made in a comprehensive, step-by-step manner. Personally, I can't wait until the submerged shelf off of Cuba can be opened up to detailed study.

This collection contains the first 4 issues that established the basics and the tone.<br /><br /> The Spectre has always been an underrated character in the DC universe, inspite of the fact that he is the most powerful, and that he was created by Jerry Siegel (the co-creator of Superman.)<br />Ostrander, and the artist Tom Mandrake, were the first to really do justice to the character.<br /><br /> Here is the Wrath of God welded to a human soul. This dual creature, part man, part immortal aspect of the Creator, is tasked to wander the earth confronting evil and avenging the unavenged dead. It is a task at which he must ultimately fail, or as the character admits: \\"For fifty years, that's what I've done. And the world is no better.\\" You see, he was meant to confront and COMPREHEND evil, for when his mortal portion understood WHY men commit evil, then his soul would be freed and...another soul would be welded to that of the Spectre to serve penance. Morally, philosophically, theologically it is some pretty heavy stuff.<br /><br /> And when the Spectre shows his true aspect and power while proclaiming \\"There will be Justice! There will be Retribution! You must pay!\\" well, it still gives me chills. After all, this is the voice of the Wrath of God....	2002-10-24

This thick tome is the equivalent of a doctorate in metaphysics.

Whitcomb has sumarised everything in amazingly clear tables, lists, and diagrams without trivialising anything. He even shows the cross correspondenses between various systems and cultures (Egyptian, Greek, Tibetan, Native American, Hebrew, Chinese, etc.)<br /><br />  My only criticism is that there is not a leather bound hard cover edition for my permanent library- I know I'll have my own copy custom bound at the first opportunity.	2002-10-19

This year is the 50th anniversary of this novel. I remember that I was working as an engineer back when I first read it. This was appropriate since most of the main characters are engineers. I remember being struck at how close Vonnegut's predictions about society actually were. Now that I've reexamined them 20 years later, I am even more impressed.<br /><br />  The basic premise of the story is that American industry is run by a tiny group of wealthy and powerful managers and engineers, while the vast majority of the population are stripped of their well-paying industrial jobs and forced to live as poor, powerless menials.<br /><br />  This elite of managers and engineers live in closed, gated Orwellian communities, where they watch each other closely for the slightest hint of nonconformity or disloyalty to the system.<br /><br />  Vonnegut shows how most managers and engineers have always had a contempt for the average American worker and have been looking for a way to replace them even before WW2. He thought that this would primarily be by automation (as opposed to simply shipping the jobs out of the country.)<br /><br /> Vonnegut also assumed that agriculture would be totally mechanised by large corporations and the small farmer made extinct.<br /><br />  There is also the eerie prediction that the President would be a man of low intelligence who would get elected on the basis of a \\"three hour television show.\\" It would make no difference because there would be no connection between who was elected and who actually ran the country. Remenber, this was in 1952....<br /><br />  Oh yes, he also predicted that no one would be able to get any job worth having without a graduate degree.<br /><br />  I know that some people will say that this novel is dated based simply on the repeated mention of vacuum tubes (transistors were not in commercial use in 1952.) However, if you substiute \\"integrated circuit\\" or \\"computer chip\\" for every place he uses vacuum tube the obsolescence vanishes. Simularly, a modern reader may laugh at the idea of a computer large enough to fill Carlesbad caverns. Believe me, even today the Cray supercomputers and their support equipment take up quite abit of space.<br /><br />  My only real criticism with Vonnegut's projections is that he thought that engineers would have alot more power and influence than they actually have. From my own experience MBA's, CPA's, and lawyers have much more power.the idea of a computer large enough to fill Carlesbad caverns.

In fact, that's the only thanks you ever get in a largely thankless profession- the joy of occationally getting to design something that works.<br /><br />  This book is a rarity, it works as both an introductory text, as a design text, and as a life long reference book. I've taken mine along on many an assignment long after I had discarded lesser texts and references to save weight.<br /><br />  You get the fundamentals of how to produce a useful, working, engineering drawing that the shop can actually use to produce a part (you would be amazed at how many CAD \\"experts\\" cannot do this.) Then you get detailed information on industrial processes and materials (casting, forging, cold heading, powder metallurgy, extruding, roll forming, electroforming, welding, plastic injection, etc.) Plus you get a good intro to standard design components like all types of fasteners, bearing, seals, couplings, clutches, speed reducers, etc.) Then, you also get excellent basics in speciality areas like sheet metal development, piping, jig and fixture design, fluid power, and structural drafting. The sections on beam equations, trusses, and strength of materials are quite clearly written and requires only a working knowlege of trig. You top it off with an appendix that covers everything from conversions and fastener specs to fit types and geometric tolerancing.<br /><br /> Whenever I get disgusted and start to question why I am still doing this after so many others have gotten out, I pick up this text and flip through it. It reminds me that America used to be known as the land of engineers- real engineers.	2002-09-29

If you've ever worked in design engineering, and you've got a sense of humor (OK, I admit that limits the potential readership), then you've got to read this book. I was hooked after the first half a dozen pages, when the newly graduated, newly hired young engineer fantasizes, on his first day, that he is going to work for this same company for the next 45 years, until his retirement. If that doesn't make you bust a gut, nothing will!<br /><br /> There are just so many situations and characters that you'll recognise from real life. For instance, have you ever been asked to submit a detailed list of materials and components to purchasing- before you've even begun the design work? Have you ever been assigned a design project only to have to consult a dictionary to find out exactly what the item is that you are supposed to design? Have you ever worked forever on a project that the entire team knew was doomed from the first week? As for characters, well, I'm strongly tempted to change my screen name to \\"Shopper Jim\\"- that advice to always keep enough boxes in your office, or trunk, to move all your stuff is just too close to the mark....<br /><br /> Prior to this, the only humorous novel that I ever found dealing with engineers was Vonnegutt's _Player Piano_. While that book is excellent, and reminds me of my early days, this novel is right on the money with the current state of the profession.<br /><br /> Oh yeah, after you've read this, the fact that manufacturing (and engineering) in the U.S. is packing up and/or dieing off is alot easier to take....	2002-09-20

He spent the rest of his life, he was in his mid-thirties at the time, trying to figure out what had happened to him, and if there were any others.<br /><br />  What he found was that such sudden occurances of enlightenment, these epiphanies, had been occuring to mystics, philosophers, writers, and artists all through recorded history. Not only that, but they were occuring with increased frequency as time went on. Bucke concluded that this marked an evolutionary trend. Carried out to its logical conclusion, he postulated that one day \\"cosmic consciousness\\" as he termed it, would be as common in the human race as self consciousness currently is. He based this on the manner in which the ancestors of man slowly climbed from the simple consciousness of animals to an almost universal state of self consciousness.<br /><br />  Having experienced a simular event in my mid-thirties (remember, it happens to varying degrees), I found this book to be immensely personally relevant- as it has proven to be to many of us for over one hundred years now.	2002-09-14

In fact, at one point Morpheus himself admits that he doesn't fully understand it. That's alright though, any time you fully and completely understand a plot without working at it, and wondering at it, you are probably wasting your time. You would be better off sticking to T.V.... As it is, we have Mystery in it's deepest sense. Moreover, we have mystery populated by the best developed, most believable, cast of unconventional characters in graphic literature. You get sucked into the Vortex because you care about the people you are reading about- not unlike life, really. What is the Vortex? It is a person, and a phenomenon, that breaks down the barriers between individual dreams and leaves a black hole in it's wake. It is also a young woman by the name of Rose Walker. How appropriate....<br />  Oh yes, as for the Corinthian, the escaped nightmare, and his fellow \\"collectors\\", well I can believe that he was the finest nightmare that Morpheus ever created. He has certainly made himself at home in my nightmares.	2002-09-14

The story line reveals that dreams can reach into and effect our waking \\"reality.\\" It also shows us that dreams can have power, dreams can be shared, dreams can be stolen, and lastly, dreams can finally die. Indeed, here we have the first seeds of the end of Dream himself.<br /><br />_The character developement is superb, you actually recognise these characters from daily life without them slipping into stereotypes. I found myself caring about them.<br /><br />_Personally, I think that Thessaly, the Diannic witch is the most important character introduced. It is her arrogance and manipulation of the worlds, in the service of her own ego, which will ultimately result in the permant ending of things far beyond her limited power to comprehend....<br /><br />_This book can really stand on it's own without knowlege of the rest of the series once you accept that the archetype of dream is personified in Morphius, and that he has a sister named Death. Not too far a stretch, for both death and dreams carry us across the threshold into other worlds.	2002-09-13

Indeed, you actually have hints and echos of the ultimate fate of Morpheus in this first book.<br /><br /> In the first part, \\"Sleep of the Just\\", you might be forgiven for thinking of Morpheus as some sort of vengeful, dream vampire- a lord of nightmare over dreams. Already in \\"Imperfect Hosts\\", you find introduced the triple goddess who will later figure so prominently in the dream king's fate many volumes later in \\"the Kindly Ones.\\" In \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\" we get our first hint of the depth of compassion and mercy of the character. This is followed by the revelation in \\"A Hope in Hell\\" that the king of dreams must also of necessity be the giver of hope to mankind (i.e. even Lucifer acknowledges that without the ability to dream of heaven, hell itself would have no hold on it's inmates.) Then, in \\"Passengers\\" and \\"24 Hours\\", we have, frankly, the most horrendous, sadistic, sickening, blood bath in the history of D.C. Comics. Then, all is put right by Morpheus in \\"Sound and Fury\\", as a demonstration of the difference between a wise and compassionate Lord of Dreams, and the Insanity of a true Lord of Nightmare. The character of Morpheus is now firmly and sympathetically established. Finally, in \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\", we meet the first of Dream's family- beautiful, compassionate, humorous, Death. We also get just a hint of the dissatisfaction and ennui that will ultimately guide Morpheus's fate.<br /><br /> If you have never read this series of the finest of graphic literature, then I envy you. You have nine more volumes that will rivet your attention and transport you to another world- the world of dreams.	2002-09-13

For, as the other reviewers have pointed out, this is set up to be the final, anticlimactic installment where Buddy leaves his third-rate, post-industrial, prolonged adolescence for third-rate, post-industrial, adulthood (or at least the superficial trappings of it).<br />  Somehow, I don't think this will be the end of the Buddy Bradley story. Buddy mirrors too closely the fate of the typical &quot;post industrial&quot;, working class kid. This won't be the end of his unhappy decline because things continue to get worse for the working class. Even though Buddy has &quot;settled&quot; for a mediocre existance he will not even be allowed to keep that. I rather expect that in a few years Mr. Bradley's business will fail and he will find himself trying to sell his labor as a middle age wage-slave competing against younger versions of himself for the same crummy jobs.

He is using simplified symbolic characters to explore the human condition. He dumps them into a strange world on an involuntary journey to solve a puzzle for survival, with no instructions. All is mystery, but with a hint that an omnipotent (but unknown) power must be behind it all. Sounds alot like life, doesn't it?<br /><br />As for the symbolism of the characters, the Brigadier (from a world of perpetual, mechanised warfare) is a extraverted thinker. The Parson (from a grim theocratic world) is an extraverted feeler. The Engineer (from a stable, but static, world where the British Empire never ended) is an introverted thinker. The Poet (from a world of perpetual Greek rennaisance) is an introverted feeler. Altogether, they represent the divisions of the entire human race. They come across as pretty obnoxoius at times, but that is because they are all \\"unbalanced\\" aspects of a whole and healthy personality. Simak's view here is that we need to integrate all these views, if not in each of our own personalities, then in one society by recognising and appreciating each others strengths and working together.<br />  Oh yes, the other two principle characters are both classic \\"outsiders.\\" The main character is a professor/reporter type that principly observes, occationally advises, but has no real social power. The Robot, is also an outsider and represents the working class- the people who do the actual labor, but who have no actual control or power in the society. It is interesting that these outsiders are the two most decent and sympathetic of the cast.<br />All-in-all, a most satisfying little morality play.	2002-08-29

I know that doesn't mean anything to you, but it was also the best book on strategy that Heinz Guderian ever read (the German Panzer commander that conquered most of Europe at the start of WW2.)<br /><br /> The whole book is summed up by THE INDIRECT APPROACH (i.e. never, ever, do what the enemy would logically assume that you will do.) Always make it look like there are several targets that you are planning to attack- and throw your whole weight against the least likely at the last moment.<br /><br /> It was this book that gave me a full appreciation of the Byzantine General Belisarius. This is the general that briefly reconquered the the western empire, but was stupidly recalled by a jealous emperor that feared his genius and success. Briefly, Belisaurius, would break through and operate far behind enemy lines. His entire army was mounted. He was forced to live off the land because he was far from his bases, and faced with an unreliable and jealous emperor. He would strike out between two possible targets, putting the enemy on the horns of a dilemma, and vear off to strike one of them only at the last possible moment. He would take what supplies he needed and burn the rest. He would repeat this over and over again. If he found a suitalble location to fortify he would do so. He would let his pursuers catch up and bleed their strength off in direct frontal attack on his fortified position (held by dismounted armored cataphracts and horse archers.) Then, he would simply mount up, break out, and start the whole thing over until his enemy was exhausted and ready for decisive defeat.<br />  Needless to say, this is a pattern readily modified to fit armored and mechanised warfare.	2002-08-29

It is this soul (like Jung's collective unconscious) that serves as a great reservoir of primordial images. Prior to the age of rigid religious dogma, and equally rigid scientific materialism, human beings naturally seemed to tap into this living soul that permeates and unites all. Indeed, people actively sought to tap into this \\"otherworld\\" to gain guidance and gifts for themselves and the community.<br /><br />  Now, even though modern man no longer believes in such things, this \\"otherworld\\" is as potent as it ever was. Perhaps it is more so, for if people ignore and repress this alternate reality, it seems to \\"break out\\" into the \\"real\\" world with even more insistence. Harpur speculates that such unexplained phenomena as fairies, UFO's, angels, Yetis, crop circles, lake monsters, etc., all represent such breakthroughs by the otherworld.<br /><br />This is indeed an important and ground breaking book, not because it contains anything truly new, but because it reemphasises something quite old- perhaps older than the species itself, perhaps the fount from which we came....<br /><br />  Above all, just because modern men are through with the otherworld does not mean that It is through with us.

First of all, you can tell that this book was written by an engineer for it is well organised and useful- and perhaps a little too long-winded. Still, it gives useful hints on dealing with contract houses and interviewers, resumes, and addresses of major contract engineering firms. You get your money's worth.<br />An especially good indicator that the author has actually been there is the way it is emphasised that you should NEVER call a contract engineer a \\"temp.\\"<br />My only criticm is the fact that the basic injustice and inefficiency of contract engineering is not questioned. I've done this for nearly 20 years and I don't recommend contracting to any one. Yet, more and more, it is the only way to actually find a job. It turns a skilled specialist into an itinerant technical tramp- always hustling to sell himself- and always wondering where the next assignment is coming from. Moreover, it is a meat-grinder for the youngster in engineering. There is no gradual teaching and mentoring, no recognition of a \\"learning curve.\\" There is never any training for the contractor. You either instantly fit-in or you are thrown out.<br />Oh yes, one other thing. If you have too many contract assignments and projects on your resume, many employers will hold it against you.

Having been a graduate student and a teaching assistant I knew that something was profoundly wrong with higher education. This book outlines just what that something is.<br /><br /> Briefly, Smith's criticism centers around 1) \\"academic fundamentalism\\" and the vitriolic politics that thrive in academia, 2) The emphasis on research (much of which is generated for it's own sake and is of absolutely no use to anyone), 3) the increasing dominance of government and big business on the campus- often in direct conflict with students', or the ordinary citizen's, interests, and 4) the application of scientific method and statistical analysis to fields in the humanities where they literally kill the spirit of the discipline. Overall, Smith emphasises the essential deadness and ossified sterility of a system that has not fundamentally changed for well over a century.<br /><br />From my own personal experiences it all rings true. Indeed, I've come to the conclusion that the American public has been sold a bill of goods concerning higher education. Most of us have been brainwashed into thinking that a person who lacks the \\"relevent\\" academic credentials cannot possible know what they are doing- not only is this way of thinking dead wrong, but it is dangerous, destructive, and anti-American. If anything, the best and brightest minds are simply refusing to sit through year after year of mind numbing lectures and busy work just to get a degree.

This well organised and truly encyclopedic guide is clearly worthy of his endorsement. In over a decade of personal research, this is the best single reference work on death and the afterlife that I've found. All the entries are well written, professional, and scholarly. Indeed, just by browsing through this thick volume you begin to see connections between subjects that may never have occured to you before (such as between shamanism and the mystery religions.) The highest praise that I can give this book is that it contained a sizable amount of information that even I wasn't familiar with- definately worth investing in for your library.<br /><br />_After all, what subject is ultimately of greater importance?	2002-08-02

This second of the Alex Ross/ Paul Dini deluxe graphic novels loses none of impact of the first (Superman: Peace on Earth.) There is emotional power here that is contributed by both the text and the paintings. But together, WOW, it is overwhelming.<br />There is a moral power to these books that jumps out you. Indeed, it is an inspiring moral fable. There is no blurred line between right or wrong, good and evil, yet, they are not simplistic. Nor are they watered down- Bruce Wayne lets you know exactly what he thinks about those with wealth and power that prey on the poor and weak.... In fact, Wayne comes across as perhaps a greater hero than his alter ego. You get a feeling of the central importance of redemption to Batman, and how to believe in his own personal redemption he must believe that everyone has the capacity to be redeemed, every child, every criminal, every neighborhood.	2002-08-02

In this second book Mr. Brinkley goes into considerably more detail about his Near Death Experience, hospice work, and the Centers that he was directed to build by Spirit Beings. It is a most inspiring and comforting account- this is the third time that I've read it since its publication. Always central is the message that he was directed to bring back to this life, namely, that we are all mighty spiritual beings who came here to cocreate with God out of a spirit of love.<br />It occured to me in reading this that he has recreated the ancient profession of the psychopomp, the guide to the spirit world. Indeed, his Centers sound remarkable like an updated version of the psychomanteum, a temple where people can go to have mystical visions and/or direct contact with spirits. I can see where this would correct a profound imbalance in the modern psyche.<br />The author also recounts the visions of the future that he was given in 1975...	2002-08-02

He is the essense of the best, most noble, and most purely innocent in heaven and on earth. You see, the Captain of the Thunder and the Lightning is a pure knight, there is no guile in him, no blemish to his soul. If anything, you get the impression that his alter ego, Billy Batson, is more worldly than the Captain. Yet, not even Superman is a greater champion of righteousness.<br />Finally, Alex Ross and Paul Dini have done justice to the Captain's character.	2002-08-02

Starting in a Galactic Empire that is starting to slip into decline, then on to the monastic settlement of the Foundation and it's mission to preserve the best of the old civilization, then on to the recivilization of the ruins of the old Empire. If I recall correctly, it takes around 1000 years, but without the foundation it would have meant 10 times more chaos and darkness. It is the sense of mission and purpose that holds the whole thing together. And if you like mysteries and surprises, there is the matter of the Second Foundation....<br /><br /> Asimov wrote this when he was pretty young. He still had an unshakable faith that science could accomplish anything. Indeed, he saw a traditional clockwork universe that a sufficiently great mind, like Hari Seldon, could mathematically unlock. Later on in his writing Asimov matured- until he saw the galaxy itself as a living, evolving organism- a grand Gaia hypothesis.<br /><br /> One other thing, having grown up in New York, I think young Asimov saw himself as Hari Seldon in seeing a decadent and declining civilisation before anyone else.

The first of the Alex Ross/ Paul Dini graphic novels. What can I say, the artwork AND the writing doesn't get any better than this. I don't know of any book that has captured the fundamental essence and decency of the character better. Here is a man whose one reason to exist is to help those who need his help. Whose one real defeat is to be thwarted in giving that help. Superman never for one moment doubts that the reason for his great gifts is to help others. This is largely due to the down to earth teachings of Pa Kent: &quot;As far back as we go, we've always had problems with sharing.

There was supposed to have been a third, but Dick died before it was finished. _The Transmigration of Timothy Archer_, while good, is not properly part of the _Valis_ trilogy.<br /><br /> This book, while set in the far future, does continue the specific themes introduced in _Valis_, and reference is made back to some of the specific characters. You see, this is the time when VALIS, the Logos, the greater face of God, or whatever name you choose to limit it by, breaks through into our \\"black iron prison\\" to reclaim it and banish the Empire and the black magician behind it.<br /><br />  I admit that the story takes 50 or 60 pages to get up to speed, but by that time the IDEAS that are the real value of P.D.K.'s writing begin to surface. For instance, the idea of the \\"Hermetic Transform\\" and how the microcosm and macrocossm can interpenetrate and become One- and how to God time can run backwards. Pretty deep stuff compared to most of the semi-literate pap that is published nowdays.<br /><br />  What really leaped out at me though was the fact that Dick wrote of the Torah as an interactive, holographic, computer code. It predicts the future because it is the blueprint for creation that even God refers back to. He wrote this in 1981- _The Bible Code_ wasn't published until 1997.

First of all, the research and statistical methods employed in this book seem to be above board and beyond reproach. Moreover, the correlations between positive traits and higher I.Q. seem quite reasonable and what should be expected according to common wisdom.<br /><br /> My problem with this study is that everything in my own life seems to be in complete contradiction to these findings. I have always scored rather highly on both standardised tests (PSAT, ACT, GRE) as well as, dedicated I.Q. tests (such as that administered by MENSA.) Plus, I graduated from both high school and college with honors (twice.) That is predicted by this book. My confusion lies in the fact that I have pretty much been rejected and sealed out of any significant participation in the economic life of this society inspite of all this. You see, instead of being sought out and rewarded for having a high I.Q. and high academic performance, I have found just the reverse has been true. I have found a strong negative bias against high I.Q. and high G.P.A. candidates (at least in industry in the American Midwest.) I have lost track of the vast number of snide remarks that I have recieved from personnel office personnel and potential employers upon discovering my test scores and grades (which they themselves requested.) I am ALWAYS told that high I.Q. and high grades do not mean anything. Admittedly, this is anecdotal evidence, but it does stand in stark contrast with what this book would seem to predict.<br /><br /> Faced with someone else's statistics about I.Q. and success (not I.Q. and ability) and my own personal experience in the real world over the last 20 + years, I'll have to go with the evidence of my own eyes and ears, which is the fact that this society has a strong negative bias against \\"smart\\" people.<br /><br />Of course, if the authors are trying to emphasise class membership based on IQ this really doesn't fit me either- I started out in the lower working class, and inspite of a high IQ and academic success I have been kept in the working class.

That's where the real philosophy is. Or perhaps I should say the real mysticism. Actually, P.D.K.'s thought was a combination of philosophy and mysticism, not unlike the works of Pythagoras or Plato. Indeed, I would not hesitate to place him in such exalted company.<br /><br />  Dick's Gnosticism is the Gnostisism of true revelation, of epiphany and theogony (of union with the divine.) Yes, some people arrogantly write this off as the rantings of a \\"schizophenic\\", but then they would no doubt apply that same meaningless, garbage diagnosis to every great mystic teacher or shaman.<br /><br />  Here you get the revelations of his novel ,_Valis_, developed and fleshed out in a much more satisfying manner. Indeed, unless you are fortunate enough to track down a copy of his mythical _Exegesis_ this is the best expression of his thought that you will find.<br /><br />  One last note, as much as I agree with the gnostic idea of a transcedent God (or Logos, or Tao) breaking through into our material \\"Black Iron Prison\\", I do have a problem with his concept of a Yaldaboath (i.e. deranged, lesser, creator god.) You see, human materialistic, hyper-rational, civilization functions as such a lesser \\"god.\\" Have we not made money, science, and ego into idols that are worshipped in their own right to the exclusion of the the true transcendant God?

I consider PKD to be an expert on Gnosis, afterall, it actually happened to him. You see this story is semi-autobiographical. Considering the hell that the protagonist, Horselover Fat, goes through in his interactions with a totally incompetent mental health bureaucracy, and a completely dysfunctional social and family life, you hope that it isn't too close to his actual life. Still, it was no doubt this living hell (coupled with his drug abuse) that led to his epiphany. This is somewhat like true shamanic inititiation- the ordeal either kills you, or you break through the veil of this prison world into the \\"real\\" world beyond.<br /><br />  Actually, it is the ideas imbedded in this novel that are it's true worth.

He just managed to tap into them- thank God.<br /><br /> The entire book deals with the hero's journey. This is the Monomyth shared by all cultures- and indeed seems to be a direct inspiration from the cosmos itself by way of the collective unconscious. Here we have the eternal cycle of 1) the call to adventure; 2) the crossing of the threshold; 3) the tests, trials, and helpers; 4) the sacred marriage, apotheosis (becoming one with god), or elixir theft; 5)the flight 6) recrossing/ressurection; and 7) the return to society with hard won gifts. He examines all of these elements in depth with a wealth of cross-cultural examples. The first half of the book deals with this cycle on a more individual and personal level (the microcosm), while the second half deals with the greater cosmogonic importance (the macrocosm.)<br /><br />  Now, the really amazing part of all this is that virtually all of it comes across as meaningful, interesting, and totally nonacademic. That's why academic types hate Campbell, and his mentor Jung,- they know that Campbell's and Jung's works will endure and be read a thousand years from now, while their own monographs will be justly forgotten. There are a lot of mediocre Ph.D's out there that can never forget that Campbell never bothered to get a doctorate, because he considered such degrees to be a worthless and meaningless waste of time....<br /><br />  I've read this particular edition three times now- it is well designed and manufactured and has resonable sized print.

There were so many weird coincidences concerning people,events,and environments in my own life that it just boggled my mind. You see, like all really good comedies it has the strong ring of truth. If you've ever wondered if you were the only one that the university environment was driving nuts, read this book. It is cheaper, and more enjoyable than therapy. Then read _Killing the Spirit_ by Page Smith- you'll laugh a little less, but you'll understand the fundamental absurdity and insanity of the university environment much more....	2002-07-02

There is more concentrated political and economic truth in this one slim volume then in any other book that I've ever read. Nowhere is the war against the working class exposed more clearly and accurately. \\"Free Trade\\" is the nemesis of true democracy and of the common man. Such a policy only really favors the extremely rich and less than 1000 large global corporations. You won't hear about any of this in the corporate press however, for in the neoliberal democracy all debate is side tracked on trivial issues by two political parties who both basically represent the same corporate masters (kind of like a giant game of good cop/bad cop...)<br /><br /> Ever wonder why you and the people around you feel so powerless and alienated in a vast landscape of shopping malls? You didn't think that \\"just happened\\" did you? The decades old goal of the powers-that-be has been to atomise American communities into loose conglomerations of \\"consumers\\" incapable of organising, or even thinking of organizing.<br /><br /> If you want the hard FACTS about corporate rule, then read this book. You see, a corporation isn't merely an \\"immortal person\\" under law, they are immortal sociopaths- sociopaths backed and enhanced by state power over and above the interests and votes of the common man.<br /><br />  Oh yes, if you want to know how a healthy economy SHOULD function, read _I'll Be Short, Essentials for a Decent Working Society_ by Robert Reich.	2002-07-02

This book is not an attack on Christ, it is rather an exaltation of the universal Christ principle. I found that everything that ever disturbed me, or rang false, about the gospels was washed away by the authors' Jesus Mysteries Thesis. I also realised why I have been so strongly drawn to Gnosticism over the years- it was the original faith, a faith hyjacked and perverted by an authoritarian, worldly, imperial, bureaucracy. There have been many Christs in many cultures: Osiris, Dionysis, Attis, Adonis, Bacchus, Mithras.... The central theme to all their stories was a son of God coming to earth, to learn, teach, and grow before being crucified on a cross of matter, and returning to the place from whence he came. This was also the central mystery in all cases: we are to realise that we too descended from another place and that we are to learn, grow and teach before we return there. This is the great truth to the Christ principle. How could this truth be a threat to anyone with a spark of spiritual insight?	2002-07-02

As much as I valued the authors' first book on the subject, I must say that I value this effort even more. This work goes beyond presenting the history of gnosticism, to setting forth the actual gnostic teachings in absolute crystal clarity. When you think about it, giving such clarity and accessibility to gnostic thought is a phenomenal achievement in and of its self. Unlike more academic studies, or outright translations, where you sense that the author or translator doesn't comprehend gnosis at all, here you have a definate feeling that you are getting teachings from true initiates. The analogy of the circle of the self with the One Consciousness of God at the center, radiating all of our individual psyches into the many seemingly separate bodies and egos of the physical world at the circumference is extremely well expounded. Yes, you find the same teaching in Plotinus, but only after wading through hundreds of pages of deliberately obscure prose.<br /><br /> Oh yes, the connection of the gnostic teachings to the gospels is the best I've seen. The meaning of formerly difficult passages veritably leaps out at you.<br /><br /> The authors mention in passing that when a student starts on the gnostic Way, meaningful coincidences often occur. This book was released on the date of my own birthday. I could not think of a finer or more appropriate gift. Thank you.	2002-07-02

I should have hated it, since I'm middle-aged, middle-class, and from the middle-west. Yet, I read them all, or at least the six that I am aware of. Strange. Perhaps it is because I saw myself in \\"Tom-o-Bedlam\\" in this first volume. Perhaps it was the world-behind-the-world underpinnings, ala Phillip K. Dick (if you like the Invisibles, try the Valis trilogy.) Or maybe it was because there were so many synchronistic \\"hits\\" with my own life in issue after issue that I briefly wondered if I was slipping into schizophennia....<br /><br />  In any case this series was a delight. It was written with intelligence and erudition. There is just so much concentrated input on every page, both verbally and visually. As for the politics- this is also strange, for I have come to very simular conclusions. Perhaps that is adding paranoia to the schizophrenia....<br /><br />  There is an excellent bit of dialog when King Mob tells of how one of the other major characters read a story called \\"The Invisibles\\" and wrote herself a part in it. Yes, that is how magic happens....	2002-07-02

As Reich so honestly points out, only the top 20% of the population has seen any benefit at all from the &quot;golden years&quot; of the 80's and 90's.<br />  Reich is right, of course, I grew up believing in this unstated contract.

While this story takes place in an Illinois Town of the 1920's, if you were born in a small to mid-sized town anywhere in North America, fifty years before or after, you will recognise much of the settings and feelings in this book. Bradbury captures eternal youth here, as only his poetic, Zen-like writing style can manage. The only other book that really equals it in this respect is Twain's _Huckleberry Finn_.<br />  There are small things in these stories that tug at your childhood memories and at your forgotten childhood soul (remember when you still had a soul, before you sold it?)

If you think that this is just an adventure story with vampires, then you are missing the point. Sure, it works on that level, but intentionally or unintentionally, something much more sinister is going on.<br /><br /> This book was written in 1954, a time when there was general paranoia about communists hiding under every rock. More importantly, there was also a growing fear of the youth subculture and \\"juvenile delinquents.\\" When the vampires in this story are described as \\"pallid, glassy-eyed travesties of humanity\\" the author is obviously talking about drugged-up kids- either then or now.<br /><br />  Combine this with the fact that the hero (the last true man on earth) is described as being middle aged, of English-German stock, college educated, and cultured. In short, he is an upper-class wasp surrounded by a society of vampires (i.e. blood sucking freaks who contribute nothing to society.)<br /><br />  Having said this, as detestable as it is, I now have to say that this is exactly why people still identify with the main character. If you are an intelligent, cultured individual that has ever been forced to live in a state college dorm or a low end apartment complex, then you can also readily understand Robert Neville's siege mentality....<br /><br /> Oh yes, this book was the basis of the film \\"The Omega Man\\", but a much better version was made in Italy in 1964 called \\"The Last Man on Earth\\"- it stared Vincent Price in one of his greatest roles.	2002-06-27

Ray Bradbury clearly carried the Western Frontier of Walt Whitman and Horace Greely to the Martian Frontier in this classic novel. If 1950's America would have had the rocket ships, and an inhabitable destination, planetary colonization would probably have gone very much like this. As the text says:\\" They were coming with small dreams or large dreams or none at all. But a government finger pointed from four-color posters in many towns:THERE'S WORK FOR YOU IN THE SKY: SEE MARS!\\" Heck, I'd go right now if I could.<br /><br /> His Mars is the essense of the wild frontier: the path finders, the pioneers, the pilgrims, the homesteaders, the townsfolk, the eccentrics- and then the bureaucrats.... Bradbury's Martians are haunting and tragic- and fare about as well as the Plains Indians in the face of \\"progress.\\"<br /><br /> Actually, this story parallels the story of American West a little too closely- especially when it talks of the \\"silent towns.\\" If you've ever seen the dead and dieing farm towns of the plains you know what I mean.	2002-06-26

It gains from the fact that it is written by a Brit, since you get many British works and authors that probably would not be covered in an American collection, as well as, a decent covering of international efforts from Europe and Japan. This is a high quality production, the illustration is generous and gorgeous- and the quality of printing and manufacture is top notch.<br /><br />  I especially liked the decade-by-decade illustrated timelines stretching back to the 19th century. You have a veritable road map to the development of the genre. Plus, the manner in which actual historical events of the times are incorporated with the sci-fi shows that this was written by a thoughtful, educated, man and not some sci-fi fanboy living in a vacuum and divorced from reality. Yet it is scholarly without being the least bit boring.<br /><br />  I wouldn't call it perfect, however. From the decades that I am most familiar with, the 50's and 60's, I noticed a few significant ommissions. First of all, Lester del Ray only gets a single mention in small print? Plus, why is it that NOBODY seems to mention or remember MacK Reynolds? Also, how can you cover American sci-fi television without mention of Tom Corbett, Space Ranger, Space Angel, or Fireball XL-5? In the area of films, why no mention of Invaders from Mars (1953), Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964), or Moon Zero Two (1970)?	2002-06-25

If you were born under a flag with less than 50 stars, then this book will speak to you. While it is set in 1920's Illinois, this book resonates perhaps 50 years into the future, and into the past. Alas, I fear that it may resonate very faintly in these \\"post-modern\\" times. Still, if your life is rooted in that Golden-Age of small-town, heartland America, you will recognise these scenes, these characters, these feelings. Bradbury is a writer, a poet actually, of the heart and of feelings. Indeed, before I read him I didn't have the understanding or the patience to read poetry. Afterwards I did.

When Kurtz exclaims \\"The Horror! The Horror!\\", it is in the same sense that we would also cry out if suddenly faced with the unshielded countenance of God. At the threshhold, just before we were either consumed, or absorbed, this too would be our cry.<br /><br /> This most remarkable of books is a dissection of the Western psyche. We start with the capital city of the living dead in Europe itself. This is a land of sleepwalkers who have never awakened- they live out their lives spinning castles in the air that ultimately mean nothing. This is the state of the modern Western mind. Theory and profit, but no soul. On the journey down the African coast we encounter the European battleship antiseptically shelling the coast. These are tranplanted westerners hiding in the shells of their technological terrors while lobbing shells into the outer world- without really being contaminated by it. Then we reach the coast, where the high ideals preached in Europe are more and more obviously abandoned the farther inland one travels. When the land and the natives become \\"difficult\\", pure force and brutality are used to overcome and destroy. In other words, if they will not be \\"westernised\\", turned into copies of us, they must be obliterated. Preferably while making us a profit.<br /><br />  Kurtz was a strong man. He was ambitious and powerful. Perhaps he kept up the charade of \\"civilising\\" the natives and the land in the name \\"progress\\" longer than anyone else. He kept up these empty lies until he penetraded to the deepest core of the primeval jungle. And then, this hollow shell of ideals and greed imploded. You see, as Conrad points out, Kurtz was fundamentally hollow. Yet Kurtz didn't just die, he was too strong. Instead, into that vacuum rushed the primal force itself. Kurtz became what he hated the most- he became the soul of the jungle- because he had none of his own. He became an \\"animal\\" in it's highest sense, a totally natural man. Indeed he became a natural King, as the native tribes recognised. He and the land were truly one.<br /><br /> It is a mistake to judge Kurtz by the standards of the city of the dead. Kurtz and his warriors sweeping across the jungle, taking heads and ivory as trophies, was as natural as lions running down gazelles.... Far more natural than the hypocritical, brutal, soulless, enslavement of the coastal natives in the name of \\"civilisation\\".....cognised. He and the land were truly one.

Without doubt, this is the single greatest western novel that I have ever read. It was a gift given to me as a boy, and I have reread it periodically ever since.<br /><br />  This is a magnificant epic of a novel in a single volume. The collossal enterprise of building the first transcontinental railroad from start to finish connects everything, but is really about Neale's love for Allie Lee- and everything he and their friends go through to rescue her. I know that sounds more like a romance novel than it does a western, but, trust me, this is THE western. You actually care about the many skillfully drawn characters- and it hits you hard when they die in heroic sacrifice. I know that some readers will see the characters as western charactatures and stereotypes, but that is only because Hollywood later overused them- the book came first.<br /><br />  By the way, Larry Red King's rescue of Allie Lee from Belle's \\"Dance Hall\\" is still the greatest single scene in any western novel, or film, as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />  Oh yeah, not all the language is \\"politically correct\\" these days. That's because the men who built this nation weren't politically correct- empire builders never are.<br /><br />  One more thing, the hero of this novel is an engineer, a civil engineer, and a great role model.

If anything, the printing is brighter and sharper than the originals were when they were first published.

Here, sane and civilised men go out of their way to try to avoid the horror of total war, while never for a moment hesitating to fight that war to win it, should it be truly unavoidable.

By showing how incomprehensible a three-dimensional world would be to two-dimensional entities, Abbott opens the door, and the mind, to speculation on higher dimensions. That is why the principles of this story are summarized in virtually every text dealing with the 4th dimension.<br /><br />  I believe Abbott framed this tale primarily to serve as a philosophical and mathematical justification of spiritual and &quot;heavenly&quot; subjects. After all, if a Sphere seemed a supernatural entity in Flatland, would not a 4th Dimensional entity seem so to us? I suspect that Mr. Abbott was also a Freemason, since the &quot;regular progression of science from a point to a line, from a line to a superficies, from a superficies to a solid&quot; is the way Freemasonry explains the process by which the Deity brings the four levels of existance into being. Actually, this is a neo-platonic teaching device that can be traced through the literature of the Renaissance, via medieval Spain, to Alexandria....<br />  An examination of Theosophical Society literature from this period will also show a fascination with the 4th dimension as an explanation for spirit phenomena. Personally, I believe that this train of thought is still a quite valid analogy.<br />  I found this book a joy to read, but then, I was trained in classical Euclidian geometry and formal proofs as a boy.

This is no trivial \\"new age\\", pop psych, pot boiler. This is an extremely well written book of sacred wisdom. This is a book of the Quest, and of the Grail. Personally, I've read it three times in my life, and took the time to carefully consider and fill out the the \\"personal myth section.\\"<br /><br />  The book welds the ancient celtic myths with Jungian type theory. I defy a man not to see himself as a Warrior/Hero, Lover, Magician/Wiseman, or King/Father (as expressed positively or negatively.) The book points out that as we mature we may evolve towards a more mature archetype (i.e. from Warrior or Lover towards Magician or King.) This is the result of the Quest, for both the true Magician and true King have descended into hell, and returned, to earn their gifts. There is a sophisticated understanding here that we are not supposed to strive to be an equal, homogenous, conglomeration of all these roles, but that there are separate, mature, archetypes that we are to embrace and develope towards during a lifetime. Like an acorn, we are to grow towards oakhood, or if an pine cone, to pinehood.<br /><br />  Here also is the explanation of the \\"The World Tree\\" universal to all mythologies. This tree is the link between the worlds, with it's branches in heaven and it's roots in hell. It is that which magician and shaman must be crucified on to transcend the world- or be destroyed. Indeed, there is a profound understanding here of shamanhood- and an emphasis on the complexity of this role.<br /><br />  This book also explains the failure and despair in so many modern lives. The sacred wound that never heals- the inability to accept and grow in spiritual undestanding. The wasteland resulting in a failed king's inability so realise that he and the land, and the people, are one....<br /><br />  I seldom say that I love it book, too many people use that phrase too carelessly. But this book of deep truth, deep myth, deep wisdom, I do not hesitate to say that I truly and deeply love.	2002-06-16

There are sayings from Pythagoras, Plato, Epictetus, Aurelius, Plotinus, Hermes Trismegistus, etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />  Perhaps most importantly, Freke and Gandy clearly get across the reality that the great philosophers were not \\"dry as dust\\" scholastics. These men were powerful spiritual teachers; true lovers of the goddess Sophia.	2002-06-16

I admit that I didn't read the corresponding original language text, because my Latin was never all that good, and I have no Greek. I wish that I did, though. Just in English translation I can see where these teachings transport you to an entirely different sort of mind-set, an entirely different world.<br />  Indeed, you will either come to develop a sort of intuitive understanding of the spiritual principles being discused here, or you will simple give up in disgust and dismiss it as meaningless and incomprehensible. Perhaps it is incomprehensible to modern sensibility, but it is far from meaningless. If you are familiar with Plato and Plotinus it will help. I also find that a familiarity with the concept of the Tao helps with understanding what is meant by Kosmos. I suppose that there could be esoteric teachings encoded and hidden in the original text, but personally I find the exoteric spiritual and metaphysical speculations to be quite interesting and valuable in their own right.<br />  There was a reason that these teachings were preserved through so many centuries, while so much else was consigned to flames or left to rot....	2002-06-16

This is because the author is as well versed in the mystery religions and sacred architecture of classical times as were the founders of the Craft. Indeed you come to realise that there is a comprehensive and satisfying overview of universal spiritual wisdom in these rituals, of the self, soul, and spirit (the three Principle Officers.) This is not trivial stuff. Indeed, it is pointed out that the ultimate goal of the Third Degree is to actually die to one's self and be reborn. This was also the end goal of the old Mystery Religions- and of any spiritual path worthy of the name.<br /><br />  There are no \\"secrets\\" revealed here. The only secrets are those found in your own soul after deep introspection. But these rituals do point the way, and this booklet does prepare your mind on the proper path.<br /><br />  If you would contemplate profound, mind-expanding truths that will move you closer to the universal architect and his creation, then this is your book. If you are primarily interested in fancy rings, funny hats, and go-carts, then perhaps you should look elsewhere.	2002-06-16

I had never even seen an ocean as a kid, but I instinctually seemed to have a knowlege and a love of ships and the sea. As I grew older it puzzled me that the Merchant Marine wasn't considered a viable career choice. It also puzzled me that I never met anyone who had worked in the merchant service later than the early 50's. There was also the fact that the world's biggest industrial powerhouse seemed to have so few American flagged vessels..... Well, this book explains things. You can't get a berth on an American flagged ship for the same reason it is becoming impossible to find a factory job inland- the corporations decided that it was cheaper to hire cheap foreign labor and flag their ships in third world countries to get around taxes and decent working conditions.<br />  That is why reading this book is a bittersweet experience. On the one hand it is great reading about famous captains or modern day pirates, but on the other, you realise that you'll never know any part of such a life. Pretty hard to get a sea card when licensed officers are being \\"shoved down the hawse-pipe\\" to serve as deckhands....<br /><br />  When I finished this book I dug out my old Bowditch and sextent and thought about what could have been.

When I first read this book I thought that it was the greatest thing I had ever found. Not only did it describe experiences that I thought were unique to myself, but I found that there was actually a name for such things- shamanism. I had never even heard the name before. Yet, I knew exactly what was being described.<br /><br />  That's just it, though, this book's importance to me was in its validation of the path that I had already traveled- alone. When I see people claiming that they are shamans, or \\"neo-shamans\\", based on reading a few books or attending a workshop or two, I can only shake my head. I mean, I see nothing wrong with such things, no more than I see anything wrong with dabblers in Wicca, it is just that I don't personally believe that it is shamanism. I don't say this out of arrogance, self-righteousness, or a sense of superiority- it is just that I have found that the transition involved in crossing over to the spirit world is absolutely life shattering and soul transforming. There is a good chance that it may kill you. Actually, in a sense, it does kill you, for to be a shaman means to die and be reborn. It is not the sort of thing that a bored yuppy can do on a weekend to demonstrate his \\"spiritual sensitivity.\\"<br /><br />  Personally, I think shamans are either born, or they result from a certain type of near death experience. As much as I respect Native American medicine people, I do not think that they have any sort of inside track or \\"secret knowlege.\\" Their advantage lies in being outside of the artificial hell of the modern world- and perhaps in having more of an \\"opportunity\\" to hit bottom and reflect on it.

This book tells the best kept spiritual secret in the world. In fact, it is the one secret that will make priests and scholars literally foam at the mouth at its very mention. Yet, it is undeniably true. What is this great secret? Just this, mankind's first, truest, and best spiritual guides were transgendered. Some hold that this statement is an obscenity and blastphemy, but the true obscenity is what patriarchically usurped religion has done to the memory, and the living representatives, of this natural priestesshood.<br /> I've read this extremely well documented volume three times now. The case is air tight. Not only that, it has the ring of truth. The historical evidence is overwhelming: Angakok, Assinnu, Basir, Enaree, Fanatici, Gallus, Kelabim, Mahu, Manang bali, Megabyzos, Mexoga, Mwammi, Osasenge kimbanda, Qeeshshim, Winkte, 'Yan Daudu. Almost universally, traditional cultures had their gender-varient practitioners.<br /><br /> Why is this, you ask? The answer lies in shamanism- the \\"first\\" spiritual path. The shaman naturally transcends all boundaries, heaven/earth, life/death, sane/insane, male/female. To become one and unified in the Spirit is to transcend all dualities- even male/female. Male/female (Yin/Yang)- this is also the origin of Taoism.<br /> Why is it that you have never even heard of this? Well, for one thing the Vatican sits on ground stolen from the sanctuary of Cybele- and her gender-varient priestess's the Gallae....<br /> I have no idea why this book has not recieved the recognition it deserves. It is one of the greatest works of spiritual scholarship of our age. Only profound levels of bigotry and closed-mindedness can explain the silence....	2002-06-12

As a soldier of fortune, he has traveled the world in the service of \\"an old and powerful emperor and several lesser kings.\\" He has fought with distinction in the War between the States, as well as, lived and fought with the Plains Indians on the frontier.<br /><br /> It is while prospecting in the Arizona Territory that he runs afoul of Apaches and finds himself in the cave of a shaman. Here he undergoes what is obviously an out-of-the-body experience and transport to Mars, \\"god of my vocation.\\" This is a Mars of majestic dead seas and dead cities, as well as, warring city states and aerial dreadnought fleets. It is a Mars of many races and species, some honorable and some monstrous. Above all, it is a Mars of high adventure.<br /><br /> Inspite of the fact that it was written in 1912, this story holds up. My mother, who was born in 1915 (right before the world started to go to hell) remembered my great aunt reading from this book ,aloud, on the front porch on summer evenings. That is why this audio version is such a great idea- this is the sort of tale, like Homer's, that demands to be told out loud on a quiet evening. Really, I do not think that a modern writer could recreate the style of this narrative. The themes of honor, loyalty, duty, courage, and friendship run too strong and too true. There is no modern cynicism and soul rot here.	2002-06-11

I say this in the sense that I wish Mein Kampf would have been more widely read. If people would have been more familiar with the author's ideas it would have averted horrible tragedy, and outright evil, in the world. As Ayn Rand is the author most quoted by \\"libertarians\\", \\"free-traders\\", and advocates of \\"hands off\\" capitalism this also applies.<br /><br /> Her philosophy of Objectivism is the philosophy of sociopathy, of the ego freed from the restraints of social conscience. All that is important is gratification of the ego. There is no room for community, no room for humanity, no room for God- the individual ego is God. To the objectivist, \\"altruism\\", lending a hand or doing good for it's own sake, is a dirty word. I have heard a leading spokesman for Rand's philosophy denounce Hitler primariy because he was too \\"altruistic.\\" Make of that what you will. In our own time, the proponets of unrestrained corporate power, and of the dismantling of elected government, love Rand. They tell you that only governments can \\"initiate force.\\" This is the Big Lie- there is no moral difference between shooting a man and starving him to death through economic control of resources- or controlling people through the threat of it. Rand and her objectivists are usually very adept at formal argument and logic. However, their basic premises are so absolutely inhumane that their arguments are mere castles in the air. Castles empty of humanity and God, but filled with evil.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder what sort of childhood abuse in her native Russia could have warped Rand so seriously. It is obvious that her philosophy is an extreme over reaction to communist collectivism- in the same way that Satanism is an extreme overreaction to Christian fundamentalism	2002-06-11

This is one of those odd books that I picked up off a rack in the 70's because of the cover art, and was pleasantly surprised to find a great story, too. This was the first book of the series that I read, but as a measure of it's quality, you do not really need to know anything about the rest of the series to enjoy it. While Tarl of Bristol is an agent of the \\"priest-kings\\" it is not really necessary that you know who or what they are. Perhaps it is better that you do not.<br /><br /> Briefly, this is the story of a great warrior who is captured and enslaved while on a mission for his patrons. He is famed in story and song as that world's greatest warrior. Yet, he finds that rather than accept a clean excecution, he instead submits to the fate of slavery. This decision comes as a surprise to him. It totally destroys his self image and his honor. He truly thought that he would accept death before dishonor.<br />Only one small boy shows compassion to him during his enslavement. When pirates attack the village where Tarl is a slave he manages to escape while his captors are enslaved. While returning to the burned village to recover his weapons and supplies he finds the boy's dead body. The rest of the story deals with the vengeance of what was once the world's greatest warrior against the raiders. Yet Tarl of Bristol knows that, once lost, honor can never be regained- it can only be \\"recollected.\\"	2002-06-08

When it was penned in 1894 this book was unique. This is because prior to that time all books on the subject were traditionlly written in an obscure and metaphorical manner. Bishop Leadbeater changed all that- he took 19th century scientific objectivism and applied it to the most mystical and subjective of studies. The result is a virtual Baedecker (travel book) of the astral realms. As a result this was the first modern English language text to be included in the permanent collection of the Brotherhood. This book opened, and continues to open, doors.<br /><br />  Briefly, this little volume, covers: scenary, inhabitants, and phenomena of the astral realm. Since this is the realm most closely in contact with our own it can be a most useful and practical guide book.

There is a fair amount of philosophical and spiritual information included with the nuts and bolts of how to move unseen and neutralize defenses- and opponents.<br /><br /> I suppose that this book feeds my dark side, but it provides the kind of information that outsiders and underdogs (i.e. freedom fighters) need to strike back. Indeed, the Ninja (Shinobi) struck back at the injustices of the Samuri and their lords. The Ninja were considered to be descended from Tengu- half man/ half crow demons.

Briefly, the author holds that American society has started its period of decadence and decline, and that there is nothing that we can do to halt it. This is the fate of all great civilizations and empires- and America is no exception.<br /><br />  However, he holds that we can preserve our heritage by individually adopting the lifestyle of monks. This would be simular to the way monks and monesteries preserved the best of Greek and Roman culture after the collapse of Rome- but Berman holds that the real hope lies with individual \\"monks\\" and not organized movements.<br /><br />  Sounds like the way I've been living for years....<br /><br />  My only criticism of Berman's work is that his ideal is Enlightenment rationalism- he seems very critical of spiritual and transcendental traditions (he groups them all together as \\"New Age\\"- and worthless.) While he does address Sorokin's predictions for a coming age of faith, he dismises it, or at least he holds that such a spiritual age would be undesirable. Personally, I see Enlightenment hyper-rationalism as what planted the seeds of our current materialistic hell in the first place.<br /><br />  Anyway, this is one of the most important and well thought out books that I've read in a long time, even if I don't agree with everything in it.	2002-06-07

My mother, who was born in 1915 (right before the world started to go to hell) remembered my great aunt reading from this book ,aloud, on the front porch on summer evenings. Really, I do not think that a modern writer could recreate the style of this narrative. The themes of honor, loyalty, duty, courage, and friendship run too strong and too true. There is no modern cynicism and soul rot here.	2002-06-06

There are some that will tell you that Kilgore Trout doesn't exist- don't listen to them. These are the same naysayers that will tell you that Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Illuminati do not exist.<br /> The book itself tells the cosmic myth of The Space Wanderer, who roams the universe seeking the answer to the Ultimate Question: \\"Why are we created only to suffer and die?\\" Through adventures on many planets over many years he finally finds his answer. Fittingly, it is the last sentence of the narrative.<br /> I was strongly reminded of Doug Adams's _A Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ while reading this classic. Then I checked the date of publication- I am pretty sure that this is where Adams got the idea. One more instance of Kilgore Trout being shafted by life....	2002-06-06

In fact Moore is one of the few political writers, period, that I can read these days without without being moved to rage or vomiting. I don't agree with everything he says (such as his views on illegal immigration, or Hillary Clinton) but, hey, 99% ain't bad. Here is a man that tells the truth, sure he tells it with humor, but if you don't laugh about how badly the rich are doing it to us, you just have to cry- or foam at the mouth.<br />  I will say one thing, I was fortunate enough to get Mike to sign my copy of this book.

It just shows that without a \\"stacked-deck\\" such types cannot compete with real people.<br /><br /> This isn't a nostalgic look back at our own \\"mythic American roots.\\" This shows the realities of hard-scrabble farming. I can tell that this show has a ring of truth, because my own father was born in a log cabin in Tennessee and plowed with mules. This book and the series jives with his stories and my childhood visits. The chief benefit here is the respect you develop for the people who still live like this (most Mexican families would have had very liitle difficulty doing the same thing- if anything it would have been a step up.)<br /><br /> Of course, I'd recommend this book, or the series, just for California boy saying he \\"thought it was going to be fun.\\" I must have laughed for five full minutes. I guess he better stick to dude ranches in the future....<br /><br /> Oh yeah, the Indian college professor bringing by an elk to feed the poor, desperate homesteaders was a nice touch.

This is that most rare of scholarly books, namely, one that is well written and meaningful. Briefly, Mr. Lukacs holds that much of what came into being in western society, and is largely taken for granted even though it didn't exist in the Middle Ages, is disappearing or collapsing. This list includes the state (and it's ability to provide law and order to the common citizen), money (of any REAL value), industry, cities, books and literacy, and the right to privacy. None of this is too shocking, since, as he points out, even the common working man in a bar can readily recognise the analogy between American, or western, civilization and Roman civilization.<br /><br /> I find it interesting how more and more first rate minds, like Jacques Barzun (Dawn to Decadence) and Morris Berman (The Twilight of American Culture) are coming to quite simular historical summations. It seems that one no longer has to be a science fiction writer, pestimistic paranoid, or religious fanatic to see that we are nearing the end of of anything worth terming civilization.<br /><br /> Lukacs holds that the future struggle will be between those who hold that men are mere machines and those who hold that we are creatures (in a spiritual sense.) Put me down as a creature, please.	2002-05-27

Back in my 20's and 30's during my \\"dark night of the soul\\" Bukowski was about the only author and poet that I could still read. I think that this was because he was the only writer that I could identify with. We had too much in common: we had read the same books, worked the same crummy jobs, patronized the same sort of bars, and above all, suffered the same kind of fools. So I knew that he was for real.<br /><br />  After I had reached bottom, been dismembered by demons, and yet strangely could not die, I still read Bukowski. I knew that in order to be reborn, you first have to suffer hell and die. Bukowski had been there, had done that. I knew the validity of his path. I had done it.<br /><br />  Bukowski was an anachronism- a literate, and published, working man. That is something that has been almost obliterated in American \\"culture.\\" Maybe it had something to do with his German roots.

I am glad that I looked inside, for this book represents one of the best expositions of the &quot;golden thread&quot; that runs through all the works of the truly great minds and souls. I noted this some years ago, how the same mystic truths kept surfacing in the works of men from so many different times and cultures. In fact, most of my favorite ideas, quotes, and epigrams from my favorite philosophers are contained between these covers- it was rather like an incredible string of synchronicities. I am awed by the author's ability to assemble all of this wisdom (as opposed to mere knowlege and facts) into a satisfying question and answer format that reads rather like the socratic method.	2002-05-25

Sometimes he just gets \\"confused\\"- especially when he stops taking his medication. But there is one area where Marv never gets confused, and that is in recognising Good and Evil, Right and Wrong. Yet, this isn't some shallow Hollywood morality play used to justify gratuitous violence. Marv is the soul of morality- the morality that counts. Here is a man who will hunt down those responsible for burning winos and bums to death simply to avenge the injustice. Here is a man who will walk into the jaws of hell to rescue a small child from white slavers simply because it wouldn't occure to him to do otherwise. Here is a man who gives his help to those who need it, simply because they need it, no matter how monstrous or powerful the opposition.

This is a tale of biblical proportions, as should be expected of a book that starts with the Revelation of Saint John. Here the DC universe, the DC mythos, reaches it's full maturity. Even the fully painted illustrations are worthy of a book of sacred myth. That is what this is, really, a retelling of eternal myth through the comic book universe of DC comics. Joseph Campbell would have had no trouble seeing a coherent narative here, even if some readers do not.<br /><br />  We start out with a world where the offspring of yesterday's heroes are running wild, destroying the earth and the human spirit, with total disregard for right and wrong, or the human race. At most they pay lip service to such things. This is an echo of the Nephilim, the offspring of angels and the daughters of men, who ran wild in the world with complete disregard for the same things. They were destroyed by flood, here, the judgement is with fire. Of course, there are also echoes of our own world- the powerful and beautiful running wild, enjoying and enriching themselves, with no concern for the common man. Strange how ancient \\"mythical\\" themes tend to resonate over and over in the \\"real\\" world....<br /><br />  Yet, this doesn't go unnoticed by God, or at least one earthly aspect of God, the Spectre. He makes it known to a simple pastor that judgement will come, and it will be through the guidance of such a common man that it will be decided.<br /><br />  You have the archetypical hero, Superman, rejected by a public who prefers the tin-plated idol Magog, and vengeance, over Truth and Justice. When he returns to the world, it is no longer as the inspiration for Truth and Justice, but instead as enforcer and jailkeeper in a world that no longer values such ideals.<br /><br />  You even have the \\"godman\\" savior here, Captain Marvel, who gives his life in supreme sacrifice....<br /><br />  There are some I am sure that will be offended by the use of such sacred themes in a \\"mere comic book.\\" However, these themes are not cheapened or exploited here.

I once sat through a very snide speech, by a very snide editor, who pontificated in a very snide manner, that \\"no one wants to read your journals.\\" This editor was of course a fool- the very best writing is to be found in personal journals.  Nowhere is this demonstrated to be more true than in Thoreau's. Or as he himself put it,\\"The writer who postpones the recording of his thoughts uses an iron which has cooled to burn a hole with. He cannot inflame the minds of his audience.\\" Well, these writings inflame the mind. Thoreau was that rarest of of divine gifts, a true Individual. I often wonder if he did not represent the highest point that anyone in our society ever reached- the high water mark of a civilization before steam engines, corporations, and mass education reduced us to our present state.<br /><br />  I was concerned that the journals might suffer by editing, especially if an academic type with a deconstructionist ax to grind got his hands on them. Mr. Shepard's brief introduction put my mind to rest. He obviously has a close sympathy with the spirit of Henry David Thoreau and his selections are masterful. As Shepard puts it: \\"With a fit audience, though few, he is likely to win a more thoughtful reading now that individuals are so obviously withering among us, now that men are quite obviously enslaved by machines, now that we have floundered about as far as we can in the bogs of stupidity, greed, and cowering compliance that he warned us against long ago.\\"<br /><br />  If _Walden_ spoke to you, these journal entries will speak even more strongly to you. This is the spring from which _Walden_ and all the rest sprang. This is the soul of Thoreau. It is the soul of the true America before the Byzantine rot set in.<br /><br /> There is one line from the very first year of the journals that has never ceased to inspire me: \\"All fear of the world or consequences is swallowed up in a manly anxiety to do Truth justice.\\"	2002-05-18

I say this in the sense that I wish Mein Kamph would have been more widely read. If people would have been more familiar with the author's ideas it would have averted horrible tragedy, and outright evil, in the world. As Ayn Rand is the author most quoted by \\"libertarians\\", \\"free-traders\\", and advocates of \\"hands off\\" capitalism this also applies.<br /><br /> Her philosophy of Objectivism is the philosophy of sociopathy, of the ego freed from the restraints of social conscience. All that is important is gratification of the ego. There is no room for community, no room for humanity, no room for God- the individual ego is God. To the objectivist, \\"altruism\\", lending a hand or doing good for it's own sake, is a dirty word. I have heard a leading spokesman for Rand's philosophy denounce Hitler primariy because he was too \\"altruistic.\\" Make of that what you will. In our own time, the proponets of unrestrained corporate power, and of the dismantling of elected government, love Rand. They tell you that only governments can \\"initiate force.\\" This is the Big Lie- there is no moral difference between shooting a man and starving him to death through economic control of resources- or controlling people through the threat of it. Rand and her objectivists are usually very adept at formal argument and logic. However, their basic premises are so absolutely inhumane that their arguments are mere castles in the air. Castles empty of humanity and God, but filled with evil.<br /><br /> I sometimes wonder what sort of childhood abuse in her native Russia could have warped Rand so seriously. It is obvious that her philosophy is an extreme over reaction to communist collectivism- in the same way that Satanism is an extreme overreaction to Christian fundamentalism.	2002-05-14

To do so is to constantly walk a razor's edge. That is why saints and holy men tend to gravitate to monesteries and mountains.<br /><br /> I would not describe this so much as a spiritual book as I would an honorable one. That's why you need to be careful- there is a thin line between honor and ego. There is also an inherent problem in trying to live according to hard and fast lists. As Lao Tzu tells us, when the Tao grows weak in the heart of men and nations, that is where \\"morality\\" and rule books begin. Still, as a source of practical principles on how to remain in the world and remain good, you could do far worse. Schopenhauer put great store in it and that is good enough for me. Also, I recall reading that George Washington carried in his pocket a small book of maxims written by a Jesuit for most of his life.

I had this book for a year before I actually read it. Since I primarily bought it for the great, poster quality, painted, full page illustrations it didn't matter. Besides I was under the impression that it was a \\"juvenile\\", a kid's book. Yeah, right, this is about as much a juvenile as is Heilein's _Starship Troopers_. There are some very gritty combat scenes here- and very well developed characters of depth. This is amazing in a novella of less than 120 pages (after you subtract the illustration pages.) There are hack writers out there that would have told this same story in 300 or 400, or more, pages, but Dietz does it in less than 120 without ommitting any detail, atmosphere, or continuity. That's the mark of a very skilled writer. Combined with the cover quality illustrations this book is practically a cinema quality experience all by itself. Moreover, I had not read the first two books of the trilogy, nor played the games, yet the book held together on its own.<br />  Another thing, for a book that is so good on the combat and technical atmosphere, the metaphysics are also very satisfying. The tale of Lord Hoth and the Army of Light is truly worthy of the best of the Star Wars mythos. Indeed, it could almost be a grand finale in itself.<br />  As a measure of how \\"in\\" to this I got, I finally ordered that universal remote shaped like a light saber for the TV.

A long time ago I sat down and tried to determine what I considered to be the single most important book that I had ever read. The Tao te Ching was my choice. One of the oldest books of the human race, it is also perhaps the closest to perfection. To meditate on the meaning of the 81 chapters to open your mind. You make a mind shift by contemplating what the Tao is not. I can see where Zen owes a debt to this book, as it is almost one long koan designed to free the mind and transcend the ego.<br /><br />  I've heard criticisms that the Tao te Ching was written as a manual for Emperors on how to rule and therefor has no relevence to modern man. Actually, if you live your life according to Kant's catagorical imperative (live as if your every action or decision might become universal law), then this is the perfect guide. To be one with the Tao is to be one with the Cosmos. A selfish or imbalanced act is impossible. This applies to an Emperor, a wandering holy man, a householder, or to you.<br /><br /> Mr. Mitchelll's translation is the best that I've found. You sense that he has a true intuitive understanding of the text. There are \\"scholarly\\" translations that focus so much on detail that they totally miss the meaning.

The term \\"warrior\\" is thrown about pretty loosely these days. Not all soldiers are warriors. A modern soldier is a technician trained to obey orders and complete his mission at all costs. He is conditioned to see no humanity in the enemy. A soldier is taught to value pride and glory. A warrior, in contrast, obeys an inner code of conduct above all orders. A warrior sees the common humanity in all mankind- especially in an opponent. A warrior has renounced ego, so pride and glory are irrelevent.<br /><br />  This gem of a book gives the road map of the warrior's path. It is a path that you will probably only recognise if you have already traveled on it. It is more of a confirmation of lessons hard won in the battle of life. No book will magically show you the sacredness, the fundamental goodness, of the cosmos. Only experience, and deep meditation on that experience will do that. To be a warrior is to achieve synchronisation with all that is. Once you have reached this state you are incapable of acting with dishonor. To do so would be contrary to Nature. Moreover, once you have achieved this synchronization of body, mind, and cosmos your will and nature seem to be One. This is when \\"magic\\" happens.<br /><br />  So what is a warrior? A warrior is a person without ego, a person without fear, a person who is one with all of creation- and who acts accordingly to redeem the world about him.<br /><br />  What is an example of such a person in today's world? Those Tibetan fighters who resisted the Chinese so well and so long were Warriors. Then the Dalai Lama told them to lay down their weapons and fight no more. These warriors would not disobey their true monarch. Nor could they submit to dehumanising rule by communist invaders. To do so would have destroyed their honor. So they voluntarily gave up their lives on their beloved mountains with their weapons by their sides. They did not disobey, nor did they submit to slavery. For eternity shall their names resound in the halls of Shambhala....	2002-05-03

This book has both of those features in abundance. Only now, am I coming to truly realise the depth and breadth of Mr. Simak's philosophy. It is a philosophy than runs true in all of his books (at least I believe that I've managed to track down and read them all.) It is a philosophy of humanity over technology and progress. It is the idea that sometime in the past humanity made the wrong decision, took the wrong path. Yet, here and there, there are a few isolated oddballs and misfits who have somehow managed to remain human, even though it must put them at odds with the majority. As for the breadth of his thinking, this book alone touches on so many things, my favorite things: love of ancestral homes and the land, good stewardship of the land and it's creatures, American Indians, astral travel, telepathy, God and the soul.... Even his \\"Dark Walker\\" shows a true understanding of Jungian Shadow.  And there is always the \\"twist\\", the new idea, such as aliens and robots with more humanity to them than most of the human race. What's more, Simak always leaves you with a feeling of hope, though sometimes it is a bitter sweet hope.<br />Sometimes I think that perhaps Simak wasn't speaking so much of this world, but that he was intuiting a better world for humane spirits on the other side....	2002-05-03

This is one of those odd books that I picked up off a rack in the 70's because of the cover art, and was pleasantly surprised to find a great story, too. This was the first book of the series that I read, but as a measure of it's quality, you do not really need to know anything about the rest of the series to enjoy it. While Tarl of Bristol is an agent of the \\"priest-kings\\" it is not really necessary that you know who or what they are. Perhaps it is better that you do not.<br /><br /> Briefly, this is the story of a great warrior who is captured and enslaved while on a mission for his patrons. He is famed in story and song as that world's greatest warrior. Yet, he finds that rather than accept a clean excecution, he instead submits to the fate of slavery. This decision comes as a surprise to him. It totally destroys his self image and his honor. He truly thought that he would accept death before dishonor.<br />Only one small boy shows compassion to him during his enslavement. When pirates attack the village where Tarl is a slave he manages to escape while his captors are enslaved. While returning to the burned village to recover his weapons and supplies he finds the boy's dead body. The rest of the story deals with the vengeance of what was once the world's greatest warrior against the raiders. Yet Tarl of Bristol knows that, once lost, honor can never be regained- it can only be \\"recollected.\\"	2002-05-01

As much as I enjoyed the subsequent two novels of the Von Bek trilogy (_City in the Autumn Stars_ and The Dream Thief's Daughter_) this first volume is still my favorite. It could easily have stood on it's own as a classic.<br /><br />  The basic premise is that Lucifer is not an all-knowing, all-powerful arch fiend, but merely a frustrated, desperate exile. God exiled Lucifer to earth with no instructions and no further communication. In his own words, Lucifer tells how everything that he did since then was his own idea, done on his own initiative. First, he tried to prove that he could build a world that was greater than the Creator's (he reveals that most of the world's rulers and churchmen are really \\"his\\".) However, by the 17th century, Europe is clearly dieing in unending warfare and plague INSPITE of his efforts to make a better world. Lucifer admits that his efforts have been a colossal failure and that he has no idea why. Moreover, he just wants to reconcile with God and go back home to his old position in heaven.<br /><br />  In desperation Lucifer sends an agent to find the Holy Grail. Grasping at straws, he believes that the legendary Grail will grant immediate union with God, and as a result the Last Judgement and an end to the World's Pain. Unfortunately, the Devil has no pure knights to search for this Grail- the closest thing he can find is Capt. Ulrich Von Bek. Von Bek is far from innocent, since as a mercenary soldier he has wilfully commited murder, torture, rape, and robbery as \\"part of the soldier's craft.\\" Von Bek does have a conscience, though- he just gambled that there was no God or Devil to answer to for his crimes.<br /><br />  Von Bek goes forth on this hopeless quest- quite convinced that Lucifer, and quite possibly God, are both out of their minds....	2002-04-27

The final missing Basic became a Known. At least it did for him, and for those who take the time to contemplate it- or better yet, experience it for themselves. As for those who aren't yet ready for the truth, well, maybe on their next trip around....<br /><br />  Over the years I have been fascinated with Mr. Monroe's books. Here was a thoroughly left-brain type of individual (a successful engineer and business man) with an open mind. He wasn't a \\"convert\\" to the perrenial philosophy, no, he just totally reconstructed the core of metaphysical truth FROM SCRATCH. Or rather, he remembered. Mr. Monroe was no student of religion or metaphysics yet he reached a model of existance that is fully compatible with neoplatonism. We originate from a Creator beyond space and time, we descend into the holographic dream of space-time, we gain experience (along with our kindred sparks) through a varying number of lifetimes, our more evolved \\"higher selves\\" reach back through time and space to help ourselves at crucial moments, and we finally return back to the Creator bearing our hard-won gifts. He didn't get this from Plato, Plotinus, or the Upanishads- HE FOUND IT OUT FOR HIMSELF THROUGH DIRECT EXPERIENCE.<br /><br />  Oh yes, he even came to an understanding of M-field energy and manipulation techniques ( most call it magic and correspondence theory.) He also realised the truth of the rare few who \\"can do covertly  anything imaginable- and much that we cannot imagine.\\"<br /><br />  Well done, wanderer, well done....	2002-04-19

It is extremely well-organized and the language is clear and straight-forward (as one would expect from a NASA engineer.) Having worked most of my life in engineering departments I can appreciate the courage that it took to publish this book on the part of the author.<br /> I especially recommend chapter 9 (The Ultimate Truth.) This gives a very plausible metaphysical explanation of the meaning and purpose of these experiences. This raises the book above a mere &quot;how to&quot; manual.	2002-04-10

My own battered volume is over 25 years old and I would never part with it. It must be good, since I continued to pack mine on my back through the mountains long after I had discarded most of everything else to save weight.<br /><br /> Professor Pearl covers everything that you need to know about both prospecting and working a small placer claim. Not only are the basics of prospecting (placer and hardrock) covered, but equipment, provisions, basic geology, simple tests, staking and filing, history, etc. I suppose some of the material is a little dated now (like the mining laws), but he tells you where to go for more information on filing a claim and such.<br /><br /> There is only one tip that I wish that he would have emphacized more, namely, when seriously prospecting for placer gold you have to get down to the bedrock. And not just what is currently under the stream either- dig down through the sediments on both sides of the flood plain. Also, there can be ancient deposits up on those higher terraces too- but you've got to dig, dig, dig down to the old bedrock. The gold collects in cracks in the stream eroded surface. It is a lot of work, unless you can get away with hydraulically washing off the overburden (which is completely illegal in the States.)	2002-03-20

This book is so authentic in tone and detail that I actually thought what I was reading was the truth. I actually thought that Mr. Anderson had based this story on some new historical research that not only showed that an adventurer named Andre Nemo existed, but that he grew up with Jules Verne. Without reservation I continued to believe that this was the case- right up to when the dinosaur came out of the cave....<br /> Upon reflection, this just shows how convincing a yarn Anderson can weave. I had read most of Vern's books and I was familiar with the details of his real life. Anderson inserts his Nemo into the real Vern's life in such a way that it is completely believable. I'd still believe it, if he had used Komodo dragons instead of a T-rex.<br /> This is the best old-fashioned adventure yarn that I've read in years. It not only reminds me of Vern's stories, but also of Conan Doyle and Edgar Rice Burroughs.	2002-03-15

Only a person so completely human could treat alien visitors with such unstinting hospitality- and humanity. They are just &quot;folks&quot;, a might peculiar, but still folks.

This is an extremely well edited version of Campbell's Esalen Institute lectures with some well selected supplimental material from other sources thrown in. It would be worth reading simply for the revelation that Campbell hung out with John Steinbeck and Doc Rickets during the Great Depression. In fact, that great, wild party described in _Cannery Row_ actually happened- it was being held in honor of Joe Campbell! Somehow I find it entirely appropriate that Steinbeck and Campbell should be connected.<br /><br />  I personally found another personal revelation interesting, namely, that Campbell never bothered to obtain a Ph.D. He felt that it would \\"interfere with his reading\\" and he simply didn't want to waste his time with it. Yet, he still serendipitously found a position as a college professor and became one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century.

Such things are of value only if they are obtained in the pursuit of the highest Good. This highest Good is demonstrated to be God. Moreover, Boethius points out that when evil men succeed in obtaining such goals over the righteous, then they cease to truly be men- they are beasts and subhuman. This is a refreshing reminder in the modern world, a world not unlike that of late Roman times.<br /><br />  All happyness, all worth, all reason for being, lies in the One and the Good. Even when we commit immoral acts, it is a result of ignorance on our part in seeking this ultimate goal. Indeed, to turn from the quest of finding the One is to cease to exist at any meaningful level. There is no \\"fire and brimstone\\", or talk of eternal torment in hell here. There doesn't need to be. As long as you willfully or ignorantly stray from the Path then you are in hell. And to not find reconnection with the One and the Good is to cease to exist. All of our earthly existence is for the purpose of reawakening to our true nature. This truth lies within all of us and it is only reached by personal introspection (Know thyself.) Only in this way will we return to the eternal Source that lies beyond time itself.<br /><br />  The consolation of the Consolatio lies in the fact that suffering serves a purpose if it puts us back on the true Path. Moreover, earthly recognition of virtue is irrelevent. God always recognises the man of virtue if the masses do not.	2002-03-14

I guess you get out of this book what you bring to it. Having already been familiar with most of Plato's teachings, as well as his times, I found this volume to be a delightful refresher course. Instead of a dry, condensed outline it is a humorous and original comprehensive overview. Cavalier obviously knows his dialogs- I found no \\"dumbing down\\" here.<br /><br /> Those teachers of mine that stressed that if one wanted to be \\"truly educated\\" one had to be familiar with Plato's teachings were absolutely correct. When you start digging into subjects of true and lasting worth you always end up back at Plato. When I was younger I would have laughed at the idea that some \\"dry as dust\\" Greek philosopher could ever be meaningful to me. You see, I confused Plato's philosophy with the \\"dry as dust\\" approach that passes for philosophy in modern times. Plato himself not only asked what Truth, Justice, and Beauty were- he actually came to know that they really existed as Ultimates. The same with Good- he knew it existed. Plato accepted the validity of omens, dreams, the Mysteries, and the pre-existence of the human soul, as well as, an afterlife. It was Plato who gave us the concept of \\"heaven.\\" In fact, if you examine the words that were put in Christ's mouth in the New Testament you find that every statement is a paraphrase of Plato.<br /><br /> As for political matters, Plato believed that concern over one's own wealth and power was the source of most conflict, and that the goal of any system of laws and government should be making all people as happy and friendly as possible- and not merely a privileged elite.<br /><br /> I can't help but speculate on how different western culture would have been if Plato's undiluted teachings, or even Plotinus' neoplatonism, had been the real spiritual core of our civilization.	2002-02-28

Then, in the next to the last chapter in the last book of the series was my proof, when Lord Digory says, \\"It's all in Plato.\\" I don't know why I was surprised, afterall, Lewis was educated at Oxford and taught at Cambridge- of course he was familiar with the classics. He no doubt was familiar with Clement of Alexandria and his comments that Christianity is in reality \\"perfected Platonism.\\" I wouldn't be surprised if he knew of Celsius' comment, \\"Many of the ideas of the Christians have been expressed better- and earlier- by the Greeks. Behind these views is an ancient doctrine that has existed from the beginning.\\" Indeed, scholars have discovered that upon close analysis just about every statement and teaching attributed to Jesus is a paraphase of Plato. I do not say this disparagingly, for it is the point, and the worth, of these books. Lewis is pointing to the underlying truths of all true religion, whether one is talking of Narnia or the ancient mystery religions. This is the cosmic Christ, Christos, or Logos principle of which Aslan is a perfect example.<br /><br /> Don't misunderstand me, he isn't stating that all \\"gods\\" are the same. He makes that very clear concerning \\"Tash.\\" What he is saying is that whenever men do honor and worship the true GOOD, they are in fact worshiping the same thing, though they use different names.

A short while ago I stumbled upon a copy of this book by accident and I could't believe the flood of warm and pleasant memories that it brought back. This was perhaps my favorite childhood book, along with the sequels. Maybe this was because from my earliest memories I always wanted to be an artist, and that is what Harold was, an artist with a magic purple crayon. He was more than an artist, he was a creator of worlds. That was important, he wasn't presented as a trivial person doing \\"art\\", he was the creative force behind whole new worlds. Or \\"co-creator\\", for he often seemed as surprised as the reader at what flowed out of that crayon. While I didn't become an artist, I did work for most of my life as a draftsman and designer. I've seen many, many things in the real world start life as a drawing on my board or computer screen. I think that I kept faith with Harold....	2002-02-16

It was my opinion that he was laughing all the way to the bank at the dupes who bought his books- and paid for his habit. Then I sat down and read this book, and _The Place of Dead Roads_, and The Western Lands. I was dead wrong. This is an unique and valid vision. This is modern art in print, designed to rip the mind free from its habitual sleep walking. And that is strange, for this is one prolonged nightmare, or bad trip.... yet, while I was reading this I got this sense of deja vu, like the Cities of the Red Night and a Place of Dead Roads actually exist-somewhere- perhaps on the threshholds of hell, or limbo, or.... even \\"heaven.\\" Where ever it is, it is a place on the border where only dreams, drugs, or black magic can take you.<br /><br />  Moreover, I think I understand Burroughs place in the beat trilogy. Kerouac was the holy fool who had the capacity to touch on direct union with the Divine. Ginsberg, was the secular humanist, a good man well grounded in the world. Burroughs, however, walked the left hand path, the shadow. Taken together, all three, the holy trinity, were the composite soul of an age.	2002-02-15

This was the first book that I bought, or read, to help me interpret the tarot. As the years have passed I have come to realise that it is also the best. There are too many mundane, cookie cutter, tarot references out there. This book truly explains the deep meanings behind the hermetic symbolism of the Waite-Rider deck. With the systems and symbolism section it becomes a comprehensive text on metaphysical thought- a true book of Thoth, or Hermes. My only complaint is that there is no deluxe copy with leather binding and vellum pages. I would gladly pay extra for it, for this is the kind of book you will refer to again and again over a lifetime. Of course, if the tarot is no more than a new-age parlor game to you, you might want to look elsewhere. If you are prepared to meditate on the meaning of deeper things, then you have found your guide.	2002-02-12

In this book John Edward comes across as down-to-earth and unpretentious as he does on television. He comes across as an average Joe that has dedicated himself to developing an ability that we all have- he just KNOWS that it is possible and has put the work in to hone the ability. This is really amazing when you stop to ponder the ramifications of what he is doing. Think about it, he is presenting specific information that no one else could know in many cases. And he does it consistently. He is giving us confirmation that our spirits survive. What could possibly be more significant than that? Sure, he has to market it as entertainment to get it out to the public, but this is far, far more. This is profoundly important stuff. Yet at no time do you get the feeling that he is \\"selling\\" you any particular viewpoint or dogma. Think of the comfort and closure that this show has brought to people. Yet, he fully explains how he does it- at no time does he \\"mystify\\" you with his \\"special powers.\\" He even tells you that you don't need a psychic medium to connect to the other side- that you can do it yourself. He even tells you how to spot fakes. And he does it with humor and a smile.	2002-02-12

The only reason that I am making an exception in this case is that I suspect that this is one of the most profoundly meaningful papers written in the modern era. Jung must have thought so also, for he knew that he was most likely sacrificing his professional standing among \\"serious\\" scientists if he published.<br /><br />  To cut to the chase, this paper in proposing an \\"acausal connecting principle\\" actually: 1) shows that there is a legitimate alternative to the materialistic, mechanistic world view of modern science, and 2) shows that there is MEANING inherent in the universe. Think about it, in one paper he set in motion the dethrowning of the godless, meaningless, clockwork universe of modern science. He never rejects basic scientific principles, he just shows that there is demonstrably MORE to it. This is a paper that moves to correct a profound imbalance in the collective consciousness of modern man. This paper reconnects us with the mindset of Pythagoras and Plato- men perfectly capable of applying reason, experimental method, and mathematics, yet also knowing that there is meaning in omens, in dreams, in the direct mystical experience.	2002-02-10

Nicholas Urfe is a typical, modern, young man. He believes in nothing- not family, not country, not duty, not God, not love. He is an egoist that imagines himself an existentialist. In the isolation of Phraxos he is forced to examine this \\"self\\" that is all he believes in for the first time. He finds that there is little or nothing there. This realization pushes him to the abyss. Yet he doesn't even have the strength of will to pull the trigger. This is the final blow to his world, his ego.<br /><br />  Enter the magus. This is in accordance with the ancient formula, \\"When the student is ready, the teacher will come.\\" Nicholas is now fertile ground with all of his preconceptions about himself and his world broken assunder. The magus now proceeds to introduce Nicholas to the Mysteries. Indeed, the greatest lesson that is taught is that the universe is more mysterious, more timeless, more boundless, more terrible and awe-full than the modern materialist mind can grasp.<br /><br />  A clue comes in the early conversation about the novel being \\"dead as alchemy.\\" This is irony, you see, not only is Conchis a master alchemist when it comes to the transmutation of souls, but all great novels, including this one, are also powerful works of alchemy.	2002-02-06

There is just something so elegant and civilized about this book. I was well into it by the time I realized that it was a \\"woman's novel\\", and by then I didn't care. The atmosphere reminded me of the 19th century British and French novels that I enjoyed in school. I am rather amazed that a contemporary can recapture the gentility and civility of a world gone by. Of course, it is a world with a twist. Here you have a Victorian(or is it Edwardian?) world with its obsession over steam engines and empires, while simultaneously acknowleging the existance of magic and occult forces in that world. It seems a most elegant and reasonable balance, neither too mechanistic, nor too metaphysical- a civilized balance. This book is part mystery, part swashbuckler, and part gothic. All of it is clever and filled with true wit.	2002-01-31

If I could only have one volume of Moorcock in my library, I do believe that this would be it. I have heard this exquisite fantasy compared with Peake's Ghormanghast- except that an American will find Gloriana actually readable and enjoyable. I can't think of a richer fantasy world encompased in a single self-sufficient novel. And while it is fantasy, it is not sugar-sweet and naive, it is fantasy most worldly and sophisticated. This global Elizabethan empire is quite convincingly atmospheric, as is London and the great palace itself. You want it to exist, hell, you want to go there. You would not hesitate to pledge fealty to Gloriana the First, Queen of Albion, Empress of Asia and Virginia. You want to believe in the ideal she represents, in a world that would otherwise redescend into darkness and madness....	2002-01-28

One look at the table of contents reveals the clear, logical organization of the book- there is no fuzzy minded pseudo- mysticism here. Everything from the nature and purpose of pre-earth life, life on earth, and post-earth life is right here. You find definate information on everything from angels, bewildered spirits, pets; to the big questions like the purpose of life and the nature of suffering.

If you would understand the history of true magic, this volume is an excellent overview. When I wrote my own thesis in metaphysics this book was my primary reference, and inspiration. There is nothing of the cheap and sensational here. On the contrary, Knight focuses on the central fact that any magic worthy of the name is a sacred pursuit and draws its effectiveness from the realm of the Divine itself. Do you know the difference between theurgy and mere thaumaturgy? The difference is of profound importance. Knight was one of the first to point out the roots of western magic in the ancient mystery religions and their connection with the hermetic tradition. Then he went on to cover everything from Ficino's theory of natural magic, to Pico's interpretations of the Qabalah and spiritual magic, to the hermetic rediscoveries of Fludd and Dee. He even reveals that Bacon, Keplar, and Newton were primarily Theurgists who would have reguarded their findings in natural philosophy (\\"science\\") to be among their lesser pursuits and accomplishments.

When they say that this series \\"reads like a bullet\\"  they are not exagerating. Any author that can get me to zip through five or six hundred pages in two or three days is doing something right.<br /> These books are simply the best alternate history series ever written. There are scenes that you remember for years- compared with many books these days that you can't remember after a few months.... The idea of Union Soldiers transplanted to an alien world and taking an oath to carry on Mr. Lincoln's war until entire planet is free still chokes me up. There are scenes like a brigade strength force forced to form a giant square on an open plain and fighting to the last man (while singing the Battle Hymm of the Republic) that you don't forget. Or a Republic airship sweeping down to rescue Hans and his Zulu and Chin comrades from worse than certain death....powerful images. As for the villians,well, the \\"Moon Feast\\" is my definition for evil.<br /> Oh yes, it is also comforting to think that the real life 35th Maine and 44th New York didn't simply dround like rats, but went on to unite Russians, Romans, Chinese, Zulus, etc. under the flag of the Republic....<br />My only real criticism is that if you have any experience in industry and engineering then the speed at which the Yankees manage to industrialise a pre-industrial society (and go into mass production) will drive you nuts!	2002-01-24

Of course I was right all along, for this book cuts to the mystic heart of all true paths.

This is a &quot;comic book&quot; that needs to be read in middle-age. It is a book that needs to be read long after the corruption, the lies, and the injustice have stopped you from believing in much of anything. That is because this is a tale of rebirth. The language is powerful: &quot;A MAN has risen to show us that the power is, and always has been in our hands, we are under siege- he's showing us that we can resist.&quot; In light of recent events this story is even more eerily powerful and relevent. You see, it begins with a plot to blow up &quot;Gotham's twin towers&quot; with two aircraft. It doesn't happen though, because instead of leaving the safety of the city up to the professionals, HE is there- only him. Combined with later scenes you truly wonder about the parallels.... The rebirth and resistance theme strikes a cord deep inside one.

This is the second time that I've been drawn to this unique book. Having just enough in common with Billy Sidis (membership in two high IQ societies and extreme introversion) I can recognise the \\"ring of truth\\" to this account. I know from first hand experience how this society, especially the public schools, go out of their way to haze and torture the gifted and the \\"different\\"- no matter how hard one tries to keep a low profile. Indeed, Sidis's motto, \\"The only perfect life is one lived in seclusion\\" is also my own, learned from hard experience.<br /><br /> As for William James Sidis himself, here was a person who lectured on 4th dimensional mathematics at Harvard at the age of 11. It was said that he probably spoke every language of mankind- and actually invented entirely new languages of his own. He wrote the first book on cosmology that ever theorised the existence of black holes. He was the first to see the correlation of the 11 year sunspot cycle on both climate and human behavior. He wrote some of the first \\"alternative histories\\" of the United States (rejecting official proganda.) He had absolute contempt for capitalism and corporations (he seems to have been incapable of telling lies or exploiting other people.) He recognised the fundamental contribution of Native Americans to mainstream American culture long before anyone else. He was absolutely convinced not only that extraterestrial intelligence existed, but that it had to exist. He wrote seriously of Atlantis while \\"serious\\" scholars scoffed at the idea. He totally rejected formal theology and religion- while having no doubt that a higher power existed...<br /><br /> One of the chapters of this book is entitled \\"Sidis an Avatar?\\" While William Sidis himself would have automatically and violently rejected such a claim, I personally wonder if it might have not been close to the truth....	2001-12-27

It reminds me of the \\"museum village\\" in this town- an artificial creation moved as far from the actual old part of the city as possible- primarily to escape the \\"undesirables\\" that live there now.<br /><br /> Also, when reading this book, one would get the idea that history in this town ended in the first half of the 1970's. Of course, it effectively did. Almost all of the \\"great old companies\\" that are covered, are either defunct or nearly so. The rest are now minor subsidiaries of much larger corporations headquartered elsewhere.<br /><br /> What one has now is a decaying industrial city with a huge and growing gap between \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots.\\" Last decade a major television network did their nightly news broadcast from this city because it had been found to be the \\"most statistically typical\\" in the country.

Something else finally hit me too- this is where Gene Roddenbury got most of his ideas for Star Trek. Heinlein actuallly uses the term \\"the Federation.\\" His Interplanetary Patrol is obviously the inspiration for Star Fleet with it's noble ideals, multi-cultural make-up (in 1948), it's commitment to keeping the peace, and it's 100 year record of keeping the peace (a phrase right out of Trek.) The importance of the Academy and its naval style of organization came from Heinlein, the Annapolis graduate. The way that the organization is entirely composed of officers and officers in training- that's also pure Star Trek. Heinlein wrote of all this almost 20 years before Star Trek aired....	2001-12-25

I used to regard the trilogy as probably the best work of fantasy fiction ever written, but still fiction. Then I read an account where Tolkien claimed that he wrote most of this work &quot;automatically.&quot; He claimed that it just flowed to him (he had no idea from where) but that he definately had the feeling that he was recording events that had actually happened. That would explain the inspired nature of the work.

This is the second time that I've read this book and no doubt I shall read it many more times in the years to come. You see, like Bucke's _Cosmic Consciousness_,who the author credits and validates, this is one of the great Books of metaphysics. I can think of it in no other terms but a unified field theory of metaphysics. The torus/vortex ring model of creation and evolution is brilliant. So is her \\"colloidal state\\" of awakening and transcendence. Her model accounts for everything in the hermetic, theosophic, and gnostic sources. This book has the unmistakable ring of truth.<br /><br /> As for the claim by some that the book is \\"poorly edited\\", this is simply not true. This book has been purposefully and masterfully crafted in the form of a prose labyrinth. It is constructed in such a manner as to help shake the reader's mind free of preconcieved notions and open them up. Any confused, small-minded, infant that would accuse this book of being \\"poorly edited\\" would no doubt have claimed the same of Joyce....	2001-12-13

This is simply the most intelligent, intricate graphic novel that I have ever read. It contains the most stark mixing of sacred and profane elements- and yet it works. To put it mildly, it works. It is a continuation of the story of the shaman/savior Luthor Arkwright (I fully recommend the original _The Aventures of Luthor Arkwright_). Every time you pick this book up you find something new in the complex story line or intricate artwork. Only a writer/artist could produce a work like this, for only a person who thinks in images could master the symbolist world view that it mirrors. Here you have alternate universe after alternate universe- yet all connected by underlieing currents and patterns. As above, so below.<br />  Oh yes, it also has a healthy amount of English working class bloody mindedness- something that we in America are becoming increasingly familiar with as the corporate &quot;upperclass&quot; tries to turn this society into a rigid caste-based oligarchy....	2001-11-21

This work goes beyond presenting the history of gnosticism, to setting forth the actual gnostic teachings in absolute crystal clarity. When you think about it, giving such clarity and accessibility to gnostic thought is a phenomenal achievement in and of its self. Unlike more academic studies, or outright translations, where you sense that the author or translator doesn't comprehend gnosis at all, here you have a definate feeling that you are getting teachings from true initiates. The analogy of the circle of the self with the One Consciousness of God at the center, radiating all of our individual psyches into the many seemingly separate bodies and egos of the physical world at the circumference is extremely well expounded. Yes, you find the same teaching in Plotinus, but only after wading through hundreds of pages of deliberately obscure prose.     _Oh yes, the connection of the gnostic teachings to the gospels is the best I've seen. The meaning of formerly difficult passages veritably leaps out at you.    _The authors mention in passing that when a student starts on the gnostic Way, meaningful coincidences often occur. This book was released on the date of my own birthday. I could not think of a finer or more appropriate gift. Thank you.	2001-11-04

I finished this book on Halloween night in a house in Northern Illinois very much like the House of this story. Having grown up with Mr.Bradbury's books it felt very much like a Homecoming to me also. Besides tieing together most of the tales of the Elliot family in one narative, you also find echoes of everything from the Halloween Tree to Something Wicked this Way Comes.<br /> I have always felt a special connection to the author's work. You see, like Will Halloway in Something Wicked This Way Comes, I was born on the day before Halloween. And very near Green Town. Thank you for another wonderful birthday present Mr. Bradbury.	2001-11-04

This book represents the best, most comprehensive, exposition of the symbolist world view in a single volume. Infact, if I wanted to truly understand the deep, fundamental roots of mysticism or occultism, this is the book that I would read first. Symbolism stands in contrast to stark materialism in that it assigns inherent Meaning to the world. Symbolism holds that this physical, material world is the lowest level of reality and not it's totality, as &quot;science&quot; would have us believe. The lower levels merely reflect the archetypical currents, patterns, and laws of the higher: &quot;As above, so below.&quot; To personally validate this mode of thinking in one's own life is to experience permanent mind shift. You never see creation as dead, sterile, and meaningless again. What more can one ask of a book or a teaching?	2001-10-20

This book is not an attack on Christ, it is rather an exaltation of the universal Christ principle. I found that everything that ever disturbed me, or rang false, about the gospels was washed away by the authors' Jesus Mysteries Thesis. I also realised why I have been so strongly drawn to Gnosticism over the years- it was the original faith, a faith hyjacked and perverted by an authoritarian, worldly, imperial, bureaucracy. There have been many Christs in many cultures: Osiris, Dionysis, Attis, Adonis, Bacchus, Mithras.... The central theme to all their stories was a son of God coming to earth, to learn, teach, and grow before being crucified on a cross of matter, and returning to the place from whence he came. This was also the central mystery in all cases: we are to realise that we too descended from another place and that we are to learn, grow and teach before we return there. This is the great truth to the Christ principle. How could this truth be a threat to anyone with a spark of spiritual insight?	2001-10-20

This is the second time that I have felt compelled to read this book. It is an important, virtually unique, work. The nearest works to it that I can think of would be Phillip K. Dick's Exegesis and Harpur's Daimonic Reality. However, The Secret School is definately the best discussion of the true nature of time and reality that I have found. Streiber is correct about the nature and importance of Joy, opposed to happyness. True joy is a transcendent quality that places us in contact with the realm of the Divine. As for the prophecies contained in the book, after four years they seem more accurate than ever. Finally, even though this is a nonfiction work, the prose style is excellent- I kept being reminded of the magical atmosphere of Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine and Martian Chronicles.	2001-04-30

In The Quickening I thought that it was odd that the author would say on the one hand how unfair society was, yet later on, would state that the world was exactly as it should be and that you should not try to change it. O.K. I thought, perhaps he meant this in terms of this world being a testing ground for free will, where we refine our soul through suffering and struggling against injustice. However, this book makes it clear that the author totally rejects any benefit through trial and suffering. He emphasizes that the system is unfair, but that as a &quot;superior spiritual person&quot; you should wholeheartedly join in and get all that you can. He says that the weak and &quot;whimps&quot; get what they deserve, and that one shouldn't hesitate to use and discard them.  As for Wilde's concept of flow, it appears to be little more than a callous attitude of &quot;no problems, no worries- as long as I get mine.&quot;  Wilde seems to offer nothing but a watered down version of old-fashion theosophy tailored to the business-minded sociopath who wants to feel better about himself. I should have known there was something seriously wrong here when the man expressed deep admiration for Genghis Khan....	2001-04-19

I read this book for the first time shortly after it's publication in '84. I remember that I literally laughed until I cried. I had just escaped the university environment after studying and teaching at several of them in the midwest. There were so many weird coincidences concerning people,events,and environments in my own life that it just boggled my mind. You see, like all really good comedies it has the strong ring of truth. If you've ever wondered if you were the only one that the university environment was driving nuts, read this book. It is cheaper, and more enjoyable than therapy. Then read &quot;Killing the Spirit&quot; by Page Smith- you'll laugh a little less, but you'll understand the fundamental absurdity and insanity of the university environment much more....	2001-02-10
