If you have never read an Ed McBain/87th Precinct Novel, where have you been? This end is not the place to start - as the author trusts that we have remembered his unforgettable characters sufficiently that pains are not taken to re-introduce them. Best you start back - way back - in 1956 and enjoy the ride with these all-too-human cops and criminals  - who have not aged according to the chronological  calendar, but who shall remain, if not forever young, at least forever time-lapsed.<br />Ed McBain, father of the police procedural as we know it,  which spawned Hill Street Blues and other cultural icons, has written his last 87th Precinct potboiler. Whatever will happen to all our beloved and not-so-loved characters?  Will April Carella be spared from Reefer Madness? Will Ollie become not-so-Fat and bed Patricia? Is there an heir-apparent to carry on the tales?  Pray not Whoever is writing Lilian Jackson Braun's Cat-Who-s or the Gawd-Awful *Scarlett* in response to which Margaret Mitchell should righteously and rightfully rise up from her grave and smite Ripley  and her own heirs who allowed that  abomination!<br />Faithful followers of McBain's Boys and Girls of the 87th, plead to his publishers not to let some ghastly ghostwriting idiot fiddle around and ruin it all. Let the legend live on with the same clever wit and crisp, clipped style to which the characters and readers are accustomed. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer.	2005-10-11

William Phelps put a lot of time and travail into tracking the trail of Gary's traumatic life and crimes. It's a big (496 pages) book, thoroughly researched. In the Acknowledgements, Phelps says: \\"the late great author Jack Olson once said that a [true]crime book without a few name changes is a crime story not worth telling, simply because the entire story is not being told. In my opinion, this book proves Jack's theory.\\" Yep - in this reviewer's opinion, too.  Phelps \\"goes the extra distance\\" to interview all sides and angles of the story, including those who don't want their real names released, in order to convey a complete crimology. And there's a well-known name or two here too - even David Berkowitz, \\"Son of Sam\\" puts in a cameo in text and center photo. Why? Read this book and see!  Owen's Ann Rule rule: Don't peek at the pictures and accompanying text in the center until the suspect has been identified by law enforcement, unless you are one of those folks who read the last chapter of any mystery first ;-) applies here but I suggest that this time, you don't peek at the center pictures and text at all until you're at The End lest you spoil this surprise End. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer	2005-09-29

I'm so glad I did.<br />Jenna Lamia's exquisite performance of  Sue Monk Kidd's timely and timeless tale is reminiscent of another young motherless Southern girl, Scout, in Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.

Who or What Ever this sadistic serial slayer be, each rhyme crime - the dreadful murders with mayhem of Humpty-Dumpty*, Little Boy Blue, Jack Spratt etc.** is \\"signed\\" by leaving a hollow chocolate bunny - hence, the title \\"the hollow chocolate bunnies of the apocalypse.\\" (all lower case, as most of the characters are wee creatures.)  Farm boy Jack and his \\"bestest friend\\" Eddie the Teddy Bear are on the case.<br /><br />With frequent wry winks at and through `the 4th wall,' sometimes more fumbling and bumbling than Colombo, always allegorical a la Animal Farm, and simmering with snide side-snipes at contemporary geo-politics and sociology,  reminding this reviewer of Gregory Maguire's marvels,  Robert Rankin's rollicking, roiling racontement is more fun that a basket of chocolate bunnies! /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer<br /><br />* We learn that conspiracy theories abound on just how Humpty Dumpty fell off that wall (Note that in Rankin's raucous version: 'There was a regiment of soldiers passing at the time, but they couldn't resuscitate him. Paramedics patched him up, though. They were conveniently close.' So, although all the King's soldiers and all the King's men couldn't put Humpty together again, he did live on - until his brutal boiling here in Rankin's book.)  \\"Yet another theory has it that there was more than one Humpty Dumpty, but no wall involved: one Humpty fell from the side of a grassy knoll and another from the window of a book depository.\\"<br /><br />** For a refresher course on the victims and their back-stories, er - make that back-rhymes ;-) this is a fun and informative site: rhymes.org.uk	2005-08-30

This time, our hapless heroine Skye is on summer vacation from her vocation as a school psychologist in the small Illinois town of Scumble River - where she is in charge of her community's part of a 100 mile long Yard Sale along old Route 66. Alas, poor Cookie, we barely knew ye, but, as must happen to make a murder mystery, ye are dead.  And Skye's on the case.  The chapter titles in this Classic Route 66 installment of the series are apt and fitting from Classic TV: \\"To Tell the Truth,\\" \\"Truth or Consequences,\\" \\"I've Got a Secret,\\" and, oh yes, \\"Murder, She Wrote.\\"<br /><br />Author Denise Swanson, herself a School Psychologist in Illinois, was paying attention in writing class when the teacher told them to \\"Write what you know!\\" The results work. The reader need not read all the books in this series in order - Swanson artfully gives new readers the background and returning readers a refresher course - but why miss all the fun back down on the farm?

This reviewer would hazard a guess, bourne out by previous reviews here, that author Fern Michaels offends the very reader base for whom she writes \\"Pretty Woman,\\" a very predictable bit of beach reading romantic fluff wherein the reader knows from the get-go that the heroine is going to do the ugly-duckling-into-beautiful-swan thing and get the guy.  What grates is that Ms Michaels repeatedly describes and disparages her heroine as a hopeless blimp guilty of the unforgivable/mortal sin of being a size 14 at the beginning of the metamorphosis.<br /><br />News Flash to Fern: Marilyn Monroe was a size 16.

Here's a delectable morsel from his travels and flavourable flair:<br /><br />If you ever want to know what America looks like - and I direct this chiefly toward the residents of the coastal cities who tend to write about America most frequently - I would suggest you abandon the airports.  The only people in airports are rich people. Take a bus from Sioux City to Kansas City, via Omaha and Maryville.  Here is where America lives, more often than not overweight, beset by children, fast-food fed, television-dulled, strongly perfumed, running low on options and telling their stories to whomever will listen, hatching schemes, self-dramatizing, preaching doomed sermons, dreaming of being other people in other lives.<br /><br />Almond's Joyful book is a magical mystical confectional tour.  And there's an essential index in the back to assist in ordering all the fun freaky food whereof he writes.

The author doesn't say who he is in the scheme of things.

Reading and writing reviews in the Land of (frozen 1/2 the year) Sky Blue Waters, I  frequently choose books of  winter theme.  This one portends to involve something similar to  the Lindbergh Baby kidnapping.

The eldest daughter went missing - presumed kidnapped.  Now she has returned to what's left of the Winter  family, there's been another ice pick murder, and Mallory, Detective, is on the case. If you have not previously read Carol O'Connell's Kathleen Mallory Novels, do not start here.  You may frequently be as lost as Nedda Winter was.

He thought his wife's disappearance would be a ripple in a little pond.  More like a Tsunami swept  San Francisco Bay and beyond.<br /><br />There are other books about the saga of Scott Peterson and Laci's legacy, but this one, by Court TV commentator and former Texas State Judge Catherine Crier, really does live up to its subtitle: \\"The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation.\\"  Crier clearly has no ambivalence as to Scott's guilt or the jury's verdict - she pulls no punches: the reader learns early-on that she thinks Scott is sociopathic scum.<br /><br />This in-depth Hardcovered 430 plus page tome published by big-time publisher HarperCollins is engrossing and informative and includes colour glossy photos in the middle and black and white evidence photos at the end, as well as a handy dandy index.

This time, we're in and out of North Dakota and on a road trip with a band in the 1930's.

The eras are varied. But the jarring jumping back and forth in the time/space continuum within each recounting is enough to make even the head of Scott Bakula, seasoned Quantum Leaper, spin.

For the  reader whose interest is whetted by the saga of Marjorie Congdon LeRoy Caldwell Hagen, I suggest Will to Murder: The True Story Behind the Crimes & Trials Surrounding the Glensheen Killings by Feichtinger, Desanto, & Waller.

Facchini, and photographed and illustrated by his son, with cameo mention of famous fiction Chicago storyteller Father Andrew Greeley, this is a fascinating book on many levels (it even encompasses a history of how some funeral customs came to be customary.)<br /><br />The book documents Catholic Clerical in-fighting and, arguably without intention, the divisions between the various immigrant ethnic groups of Chicago Catholics, for instance: \\"the Irish had a great advantage over most other newcomers because they spoke English..\\"  Shame on ya, former Father Facchini!  The native tongue of the Irish is Irish!

When he dies, married to wife #2, the kids in Family #1 are unhappy that Daddy didn't leave them the proverbial farm and all the underlying Texas mineral rights thereto.  So, two of the Family #1 daughters waltz across, zig zagging back and forth around, Texas trying to prove that Wicked Stepmomma forged a Will not giving them what they feel to be their due.<br /><br />This saga is all relayed to the reader in screenplay fashion - via expository cell phone conversations and faxes in the present (so she goes to Betty's and like, opens the door and goes...) Valley Girl lingo tense as the amateur sister sleuths try to grab the Texas gold.  The author (Sister Sleuth # 1) writes of herself in the 3rd person.

Jan Fennell has found a kinder, gentler, training paradigm that makes sense to the dog. It's mentor Monty Roberts' \\"Horse Whisperer\\" with no horses and no Bobby Redford.<br />Fennell's Thesis: Dogs are descended from wolves. Dog behaviour is still ruled by the wolf pack mentality.  Domesticated dogs don't think they are a member of the human pack with which they abide, but rather that \\"their\\" humans are part of the dog's pack.  When the human members of the pack behave unfathomably to the dog's brain, the dog feels compelled to become alpha dog by default, the \\"politics of the pack.\\"  The author points out that, like a 1 year old child, the dog is ill-equipped to be pack leader in a human world and oft-times becomes neurotic trying - with various and sundry bad manifestations of the stress. How, then, to \\"relieve the dog of its delusion of power?\\" The answer, asserts author Fennell, is Amichien Bonding. Many anecdotes and antidotes are provided in this Twofer (2 books in 1) edition: *The Dog Listener* and *The 30 Day Training Guide,* the latter implementing the insights of the former.

This time, it appears Scumble River and the surrounding communities in Illinois' Heartland are being visited by the plagues of Egypt: Fire, Flood, Famine, - and the death of the lead singer in Skye's brother Vince's band, the Band Formerly Known As Plastic Santa, now Pink Elephant. In keeping with the Band Motif, the chapter names are apt and fitting from Our Generation - like &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; and &quot;That'll Be The Day.&quot;<br /><br /> Author Denise Swanson, herself a School Psychologist in Illinois, was paying attention in writing class when the teacher told them to &quot;Write what you know!&quot; The results work. The reader need not read all the books in this series in order - Swanson artfully gives new readers the background and returning readers a refresher course - but why miss all the fun back down on the farm?

Often, photos of the locale and crime scene are also useful!<br /><br />*Give us cogent, coherent background biographies of the principals.<br /><br />*If you are going to introduce a cast of thousands, or even a cast of many, please incorporate an index at the end so the reader is not head-scratching \\"Where have I heard this name before?\\" or having to add further details to the chart/bookmark described below.<br /><br />In the beginning, this book is a mess, and may dishearten the casual reader who doesn't want to have to create an identity chart/bookmark just to slog on through.  Perseverance pays off here as the writing does smooth down. And the tale it tells becomes a riveting read.  I give it 3 and a half stars.

Krakauer examines this in the context of  the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and break-away cults.  He also ponders the conundrum between zealotry and madness (sometimes it's in the eye of the beholder.)<br />Many religions have deviants, rogues and/or stuff they'd rather hide: Muslims have Al-Qaeda; The Roman Catholic Church has the Inquisition, complicity in the Holocaust (Hitler was never excommunicated) and current Priestly scandals; Southern Baptists have Jerry Falwell and Jimmy Swaggart, and let's not forget Jim and Tammy Faye!<br />This reviewer is tempted to whine that there are no pictures in Krakauer's book on miscreant ex-Mormon misfits, as photos are  often a sine qua non of mine for a 5 Star rating of a True Crime book.

In the end, he says the Death Penalty should be abolished in Oklahoma and every other State, and the Federal government should reserve it only for treason, terrorism, and political assassination.

Before Lifetime's Movies, ER, &amp; Chicago Hope, few people (even  Medical Care Providers) had heard of Munchausen's Syndrome By Proxy.  All most friends, relatives, and authorities who came in contact with Tanya Thaxton Reid and her two beleaugered children knew was that those kids were having a tough time.  One died and another almost did before folks in Iowa finally put together the trail of misery from Texas through ChicagoLand and Des Moines and in and out of numerous ambulances, clinics, and hospitals.<br />Gregg Olsen is one of my favorite True Crime writers.  This time, he careens hither and yon, back and forth, geographically and chronologically, to build the story and suspense. The culmination, the Texas trial for murder, though, is given short shrift and is tacked on in the final pages like a mere footnote.  And one wonders, what happened to the two children lucky enough to have survived this Mother?  The story cries out for an updated edition!<br />Reviewed by TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer.	2003-10-23

Possley's solo saga of the January 8, 1993 massacre at Brown's Chicken and Pasta Restaurant in Palatine, Illinois, is not so great.<br />Seven employees of the Brown's Chicken chain were found brutally murdered in the Restaurant's coolers.  Palatine Police and their \\"helpers\\" muddled around for almost 10 years until catching a lucky break.  Like the investigation, the book drags on after the grisly discovery until the Big Break. Into these investigatory and literary doldrums, Possley puts chronicles of Chicagoland crime: the \\"massacre\\" of 1912, St. Valentine's Day 1929, Richard Speck, and John Wayne Gacy. When the Cops finally catch the Big Break (Owen's Ann Rule rule - No Peaking at the pictures in the middle until the suspect(s) are identified in the text - is important here)  there is scant explanation of why the perps perpetrated.  Nor did the publishers wait for the State to declare their fate. Reviewed by TundraVision	2003-10-02

In 1974, Virginia Holman's Mother Molly was thirty-two when the first signs of florid schizophrenia sprouted in her brain.  In terms of the disease, \\"which usually strikes people in their late teens and early twenties, she was a late bloomer.\\"  Virginia (Gingie) was eight, and her sister, Emma, one, when the voices commanded their mother to take the girls and go forth to organize a field hospital for children orphaned  in the (imagined) impending Armageddon.  In this poignant yet uplifting work of \\"creative nonfiction,\\" we stand by helplessly as Molly sinks into psychosis, taking the girls along on the voyage.  The trip includes signs and icons of the era.<br />I kept asking myself \\"WHY?\\"  Virginia's father offers a part contemporary reality/part rationalization that Family Law Judges of that era were loathe to give father's custody, no matter how patently unfit the mother. (Thank God this ridiculous gender stereotype is loosening - but it's still lurking, unacknowledged, in some older occupants of the Bench.)  But where were the Social Workers? Why didn't the School Nurse, who viewed the black-out of the dilapidated  \\"home,\\" contact authorities to pull the girls out of that Hell in their own best interest? What about the maternal Uncle and Aunt who lived next door and did nothing? Even under the standard of \\"Danger to Herself or Others,\\" how were the obvious dangers to these two girls in  Molly's \\"care\\" allowed to fester under radar?<br />Nonetheless, Virginia survived the Bedlam, and gives bureaucrats a cautionary guide for What Not To Do  and a tale of triumph over adversity to the powerless pawns.

It is a tale of Big Time High School and College Football, the prioritization of prejudice, and the banality of bigotry and bigoted evil in what the self-described  \\"New York Yankee Jew\\" author calls the \\"The New Old South.\\"  That oxymoronic sounding  term is  \\"an unofficial but popular movement dedicated to stanching integration and federalism and progressiveness in general and returning to such old-fashioned values as de facto segregation, economic feudalism, laissez-faire government, and a defiant Southern pride tinged with a sense of defiant persecution. The New Old South had transformed Mississippi into a Republican stronghold for the first time since Reconstruction, it had kept labor unions out, wages and public benefits and literacy rates low, and the clientele of the Crystal Club white. It had diminished the power of the old civil rights organizations, held the line on the proportion of black students attending formerly all-white state colleges, and swelled enrollments at unaccredited private academies that were all white.\\"<br /><br />And here's some Wonder Bread food for thought: 'Parchman  (Penitentiary) was home to sixty-eight hundred prisoners, meaning that roughly one Mississippian in thirty was imprisoned there. ' 85 percent of [the] inmates are black. Only 45 percent of Mississippis entire population was black.' how could [anyone] possibly justify those stats?'<br /><br />The racial bigotry and injustice is chronicled way back to the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek with the Choctaw and 'the Great White Father.'<br /><br />Rubin's racoutment of 'The Game,'the Championship High School Season-ender of 1988, is spellbinding as is his coverage of the Life and Times of Handy Tyrone Campbell and their intersecting trajectories.  It is a journey and indictment of \\"amateur\\" football, \\"justice\\" run amuck, and the New Old South.

It's  grand!  There really is a Ballad of Billy in this book, and it goes like this:<br />\\"Billy Badass was a warrior<br />From Oklahoma way<br />A hero of his nation<br />Who had wore the Green Beret.<br />He met the purtiest lady<br />She was from a fur-off land<br />And Billy Badass fell in love<br />With the Rose of Turkestan\\"<br />Jerry Dwayne, of  Jerry Dwayne Austin and the Piss-Cutters<br />House Band of \\"The Last Church of Naked City, Losers Welcome\\" Las Vegas, Nevada.<br />Billy Badass  is  our hero's nickname.  His enrollment card in the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma states his name as William E. Badwater. And the Rose of Turkestan is Janna Turanova ,  of Kazakhstan,  part of the former Soviet Union.  A bunch of yonegs have been messin' with stuff they don't understand, causing all manner of real radioactive nightmares out in the Nevada desert. And Billy and the Rose become embroiled in the imbroglio.<br />Notwithstanding the impending destruction of the planet, Sanders and his characters maintain a sense of humour.  There are dealings with a minor bureaucrat in the INS, threatening mean and nasty things regarding Janna's VISA (the immigration status - not the Credit Card.) Bureaucrat says: \\"We don't just hand out the Green Card to everyone who asks. There are criteria to be met, guidelines to be followed - do you have any idea how many people want to come to America to live?\\" To which Billy responds \\"Some of us already ran into that problem.\\" And regarding the flawed, lone law enforcement officer on the Bucktail Springs Reservation: \\"Leonard isn't exactly your Tony Hillerman breed of Indian cop.\\"<br />And this isn't exactly a typical Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror/ Mystery/Action/Romance.  It's a uniquely delightful brew!	2002-10-01

Do some people lose their soul before death?<br />It has been seven months since our last encounter. In this tense beginning, reminiscent of Ruby Ridge and Waco,  boys of a  cult militia would rather take suicide pills than be captured by the FBI. What does this have to do with \\"Father\\" Joseph Everett and his Church of Spiritual Freedom? And who is brutally killing girls- including a US Senator's daughter? And how is Maggie's Mom involved in all this? And what is Nick Morrelli doing up there in Boston?  It all comes together in the end.<br />Reading  Alex Kava's  first two Maggie O'Dell mystery thrillers: *A Perfect Evil* and then *Split Second* before this, her third, is recommended as it  will add to your absorption into this spellbinding tale. Kava  and her characters continue to grow,  morphing into the well-worth-the-wait *Soul Catcher.*<br />Now, Columbo would say, \\"I only have one question.\\" (Columbo actually is in no way involved in this series - but, nonetheless: Other than convenience to the storyline, what the Sam-hill is taking so long with Greg and Maggie's divorce? No kids = no custody fight.  There are no major disputes re property division. C'mon Alex - get over it!)	2002-10-01

This book is one of the  \\"Imponderables\\" series, which, the jacket claims, \\"has become the unchallenged source of answers to civilization's most perplexing questions.\\"  Like the title question \\"Do Penguins Have Knees?\\" or  \\"Why are there legless ducks on the crests of Cadillacs?\\"  Readers write in questions, and the author finds experts with answers.<br /><br />There's  Stuff in here I never knew I didn't know.  \\"Why are sticks of margarine and butter thicker and shorter in the Western United States and longer and narrower in the East?\\"  Hmm.  I never noticed. This book never answers a logical follow-up question - Where is the geographical cut-off line? Is it like broadcasting station call letters that kinda sorta are assigned according to whether the station is East or West of the Mississippi? (W*** east and K*** west except for Fargo, which is West of the Headwaters of the Mississippi but has \\"W\\" stations anyway - but that is an \\"Imponderable\\" for another Day.)<br />Speaking of answers that raise other questions, teasers for other books in the \\"Imponderables\\" series run rampart through this book. E.g. When answering  \\"How do they make Hot Dog buns that are partially sliced?\\" the author begins by saying: \\"Now that we solved the Imponderable of why there are ten Hot Dogs  in a package and only eight Hot Dog buns in a package (See *Why Do Clocks Run Clockwise?* ...\\"  or imparting the information that the most FAQ is \\"Why are buttons on men's shirts and jackets arranged differently from those on women's shirts?\\" and then leaving the readers hanging until we can procure copies of previous books.<br />We are not tackling \\"What is the meaning of life?\\" here, but the quick questions and answers are entertaining and illuminating.	2002-09-23

Young Lillie Mae Worth's Daddy went  Over There in World War I and never came back.  Her Mother, forced to work in a factory during his absence, is killed in an industrial accident, leaving Lillie Mae with a witch of a maternal aunt, (my mind's eye conjures up this woman as  Clara's  nanny in the Shirley Temple movie *Heidi*) who quickly appropriates what small estate there is and  railroads Lillie Mae off to live in rural western Kentucky with paternal Great Aunt Esther and Great Uncle Dallas.  Here Lillie Mae and her readers encounter country school, moonshine and revenuers, and learn life lessons that sometimes  \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" are not what they initially appear.	2002-09-17

And that's all I'm going to disclose about the plot. Stop reading these spoiler-saturated reviews now! Get this book! At the end, if your experience is similar to mine, you will want to read its sequel: Split Second.  So I recommend ordering them both, or all three, and saving time and shipping ;-)<br />Previous reviewers have pointed out numerous factual errors in Alex Kava's debut novel. Here's one upon which they didn't comment: Cornhusker (or any other Football Factory) Quarterback graduates from College and proceeds to rush through Harvard Law.  Yep, and pigs fly over Harvard yard.  This former QB is now the Sheriff of  Platte City, Nebraska  (Sheriff of a City? Usually Sheriffs oversee a County, and Chiefs of Police serve their City,  but maybe Cornhuskerland is quirky in this regard?) having taken over from his over-bearingly pompous father.  He has a sister who makes Faust's deal with the Devil look good.  Sure, there are errors, and the Sheriff's dysfunctional family and bodice-ripping is annoying, but this book was so gripping that it over-rode my Nyquil!	2002-09-14

Despite The Administration, he learns Native American spirituality at the BIA Boarding School, spends time in the Mormon community, and then goes off to play Bingo with Roman Catholics.<br />Author Brady Udall (I looked at his biography on edgarmint.com - it doesn't have a family tree, but I bet, from the sensibilities and sensitivities and of this book that he's related to Mo) knows whereof he speaks, exhibiting empathy and understanding of Native American  (is Vincent DeLaine created in the image of Vine DeLoria?) and environmental issues, and of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- Day Saints, but then the reader suddenly stumbles upon this unexplained paragraph: \\"At eighteen Edgar got his driver's license so he could prowl the hilly byways of the town in a jacked-up orange Chevette he bought from (Roman Catholic) Father Grinev's son-in-law...\\"  Say, WHAT?

It is a reminder that we've come a long way in the development of jurisprudence since Declaring our Independence.<br />McLibel is a true tale of once upon a time, not so very long ago (1990 - 1997) when the Davids took on a Goliath (Ronald McDonald and his Big Bad Corporation) in not-so-Merry-Old England. Two unemployed activists had distributed  leaflets, (which they neither wrote nor produced,) that had the audacity to criticize the corporate giant.  The two, who were unable to afford attorneys,  were put to a Kafka-esque Kangaroo (with apologies to residents of Australia) Court trial, the likes of which, were it to appear on Saturday Night Live, would be condemned as Theatre of the Absurd.<br />The author describes the protracted trial:  \\"Like the interminable case of _Jarndyce v.  Jarndyce_ in Charles Dickens' *Bleak House,* _McDonald's Corporation and McDonald's Restaurants Ltd. vs. Helen Marie Steel and David Morris_ (popularly known as the McLibel case) drone(d) on in claustrophobic isolation.\\"<br />One of the most striking things about McLibel, to the American sensibility, is the arcane, archaic, bizarre, Byzantine Quagmire of British libel law. The book is sometimes difficult to digest.  There are no footnotes, endnotes, annotations, or other direct attribution of sources. I was disappointed that the Writ and other pleadings (actual legal papers which are the foundation of a lawsuit,) were not included in the Appendix.  A reproduction of the offending leaflet would also have been helpful.  The author, British \\"Environmental Journalist\\" John Vidal (Hey! Is he related  to Gore Vidal?) frequently plagues the reader with his own protracted political polemics.  But it is, nonetheless, enriched food for thought.<br />Do you want fries with that?  Here's an interesting bit of trivia included in the book: Ray Kroc, founding force behind McDonald's as we know it, was in the same World War I ambulance driving company as Walt Disney.c, founding force behind McDonald's as we know it, was in the same World War I ambulance driving company as Walt Disney.	2002-08-26

This cozy continuation of Cabot Cove capers is comfortable, but climax-challenged.  The ?Murder, She Wrote? book series is ?based on the Universal television series? ostensibly written in the 1st person by Jessica Fletcher, with a little help from Donald Bain.  It is fairly true to the long-running tv series, with variations that only the more-than-casual viewer might catch.  At the book?s beginning, Jessica awakens, puts on the kettle for tea, and settles into her den to watch NBC?s Today Show. ?Willard Scott, my favorite weatherman??  Jessica would never have been allowed to do or say that!  All those Sunday nights on CBS!<br />This time, Jessica is off to San Francisco for a publication tour on her new murder mystery book.  While addressing some inmates at a Women?s prison, she is slipped a Diary of a convict in whose proclaimed innocence Jessica comes to believe. So if Kimberly didn?t do it, who did? And why is someone trying to joust Jessica off the Golden Gate Bridge?<br />Yet there?s Jessica?s characteristic good humour.  ?I reached the San Francisco side [of the Bridge] in what might have been the fastest mile ever recorded by a female mystery writer from Maine who was on the wrong side of fifty.?  While addressing a high school class about mystery writing, Jessica responds to a question regarding actress selection: ?Joan Fontaine, or Vivien Leigh.  Of  course, I?d be pleased if Angela Lansbury played me in a film version of my book.?  Unfortunately, the class is unfamiliar with any of these ?mature? actresses.<br />The characterization, plot, and pace are good until the wet-fire-cracker end.  No, I?m not going to tell you ? or even hint! Read the book ? it?s a fun visit with old friends.	2002-08-16

As previous reviewers have noted, it is a powerfully painful book.  Painful because of the truths that it releases from the dark recesses where the \\"Powers That Be\\" have tried to hide them.<br /><br />Let it speak for itself:<br /><br />The people [of Twin Buttes, Wyoming - a small county seat town just off the Arapaho Reservation] tolerated the preacher who got caught in the whorehouse when the sheriff made a raid to collect his payoff. The people tolerated the sheriff and the people also tolerated Abner Hill, \\"that Indian Lawyer,\\" they called him.<br />Other notions prevailed. Equal rights for Indians? How could savages have equal rights?  Best you could do with Indians was keep the drunks and their old jalopies off the highways. The more Indians the sheriff jailed the better a citizen's chances one wouldn't run into you head-on and kill your whole family Yet some Native Americans had been honored as upstanding citizens, war heroes especially.  But those who \\"had made it\\" were usually exterminated by their assimilation. They murdered the Indian in themselves by taking on the white man's ways.<br />Yet the townspeople accepted the Native Americans as an immutable part of the environment, like winter storms and the hot winds of summer. Not many thought of the old men sitting in front of the JC Penny store wearing their black stovepipe hats and cheap cotton blankets as the remnant of a once great Indian Nation. Few felt guilt for the white man's original crimes against the aboriginal people, for these were not the crimes of the townspeople of Twin Buttes. ..<br /><br />The appeals were mere window dressing to make the system look good. Yet occasionally someone escaped - usually the rich. Even so those few who escaped kept hope alive so that he lawyers could point to the cases where innocent men were set free. Without hope there would be no jobs for either the judges or the lawyers.\\"<br /><br />And there is occasional comic relief - one recurrent theme is that the Manifestly Destined \\"Westward Ho!\\"ers did something right. They created the Snickers bar. And a people who can do that have some sublime qualities ;-)<br /><br />One wonders, is it coincidence that the Mother of Charlie (the potential savior of the Holy Ground) is named Mary?<br />/TundraVision, Amazon Reviewerthout hope there would be no jobs for either the judges or the lawyers.\\"    And there is occasional comic relief - one recurrent theme is that the Manifestly Destined \\"Westward Ho!\\"ers did something right.

I was drawn in by the title.  I had never read this author or series before, and was pleasantly surprised and entertained.  Ellie Haskell (sometime interior decorator, full time Mom, daughter of the prodigal Morley) and her husband Bentley (chef and restaurateur) are confronted and confounded with the remains of  the mysterious Harriet. Or are they?  This domestic duo reminds me somewhat of  a Goldie's Colorado Catering  (the series by Diane Mott Davidson) Goes  Across \\"the Pond.\\" But the Haskells are more witty and their children far better behaved.<br />It  is a fun frolic with some Saints, sinners, relics and characters endearing and quirky.	2002-08-06

So sometimes the story is told in the 1st person and sometimes in the third -  but the voicing shifts are no more annoying than ants who come to the Picnic. Some reviewers are protesting improbabilities in this plot.  Hey folks!  Fiction  is fictional.  It allows authors to come up with stuff that doesn't have to be totally plausible in the real world.

Candidate Jack's acceptance speech, as Fr. Greeley himself admits, is \\"A comic masterpiece.\\"  \\"The Republicans, he warned, had never met a rich businessman for whom they didn't feel sorry. Nor could they overcome their deep compassion for tobacco companies and gun dealers. They wanted to protect the lumber industry, he suggested, from the incursion of gray wolves.

They thought it would be wise public policy to protect the mining companies from toxic waste - that is from suits based on the harm done by arsenic poisoning and other toxic chemicals.  They had done such a wonderful job of being compassionate to the wealthy and to big business that they deserved every single vote from all those who earned more than ten million dollars a year.\\"<br />I don't think Rush Limbaugh &amp; his Dittoheads will be recommending this book - but I do!

(That \\"tom-tom\\" beat on the jingle - c'mon now - you can replay it in your mind:<br />BMP-bmp-bmp-bm- BMP-bmp-bmp-bm o/~ From the Land of Sky Blue Waters... o/~<br />was never used in any Native American music.)

(Not gouche like former ultra-liberal  Jane Fonda  who shouldda known better- doing the  \\"Tomahawk Chop\\" at former hubby Ted's baseball team's games!)<br />So, anyway, back to the Beer (born 1865 in St. Paul, MN)  &amp; and the Bear (born 1953 in the Land of Sky Blue Waters.)  Author Moira F. Harris says in the Introductions: \\"This book is not intended ... as a catalogue listing of every sales or advertising item created by and for the brewery not is it a history of the company or its successors. The Focus has been placed on the art of the advertising created for Hamm's Brewery.\\"<br />That's what she says. But then she slowly ferments on about the Hamm family sold to Heublein sold to the Seven Dwarfs sold to Olympia sold to Pabst traded to Stroh's sold to Kalmanovitz  and so on.  Through it all, the Bear comes and goes.  I was looking for more Bear Bio. I got more Business Administration text - How Not to Run a Brewery - which subject was much better done in Phillip Van Munching's Beer Blast:  The Inside Story of the Brewing Industry's Bizarre battles for Your Money.)<br />When she actually does bear bio, it's worth the price (about a twelve-pack.)  And some ads before the Bear are interesting.  Here's an ad from the St. Paul Pioneer Press, April 2, 1889: \\"Two men are shown sitting on the ground in front of a wall. Both are drinking beer and the copy records their dialogue as follows:<br />1st workman:  Hamm's beer is a refreshing drink and helps the stomach digest cold food.<br />2d workman: Right you are and when the wife is ailing she gets a heap of strength out of it - tonic the doctor calls it.\\"<br />The glossy front cover of this paperback volume is gorgeous and brings back memories.

Through intention, incompetence, obstruction, or neglect, there were investigative blunders. But the persistence of the Sherry's daughter, Lynne Sposito, eventually focused suspicion on Judge Sherry's former law partner and mayor-wannabe Peter Halat, and a cabal of convicts over in Louisiana s Angola prison.<br /> Author Ed Humes steers this saga well - churning through the moral murkiness of Biloxi and far throughout the South - touching such folks as Senator Robert S. Kerr; Jim Garrsion; the Sherriff who walked tall - Buford Pusser; and the Bishop of Biloxi - who tried to intercede on behalf of one of those convicted in this mess.<br />Reviewers have likened this story to a John Grisham novel. This is not a \\"Grisham-like\\" tale. Seems to me like this is a true tale from which Grisham created fiction. The scam at the fetid heart of the 1987 Sherry murder conspiracy, the \\"lonely hearts\\" bilking and extortion from gay men, is real similar to the scam in the center of Mississippi-native Grisham's later novel, \\"The Brethren.\\"<br />Usually in fiction, the Good Guys \\"get their man\\" or woman, or gang of bad folk.

Let me count the plates: there are 154 - taken at various times of the year, while journeying by kayak around Lake Superior.  Each \\"chapter\\" is a segment in the journey and each plate is attributed to a point on the map. My favorites: plate 77, \\"Small island east of Rossport, December, 1985; and plate 94, \\"Devil's Chair (center island) Lake Superior Provincial Park,(Canada,) July 1991.<br />There's a message in these beautiful photos and essays. We must preserve natural balance.  As Linda Benedict-Jones says in the Introduction: \\"...One of the specific wishes of Blacklock... is that the remaining undeveloped lake shoreline be kept for open access. When he silently glides for months on end around the periphery of the lake, he does it with the hope that his pictures will convince others to appreciate the lake as he does.  Lake Superior is simply too profound as a spiritual resource to be guarded by a privileged few.  Should these last open stretches be developed, they will forever be out of reach by the general public. We have learned precious little from the examples set for us by the Navajo (Dineh), the Dakota and the Anishinabe. We all know that Native Americans lived in harmony with the earth and believed that land could be neither bought nor sold since it belonged to all. Perhaps it is not too late to apply their wisdom to relatively small, yet hugely important, areas of land bordering the Great Lakes. Perhaps these Blacklock photographs will help preserve public access to Lake Superior's shores, as certain photographic efforts of his 19th Century predecessors helped to convince (the U.S.) Congress to establish national parklands of  the Yosemite, Yellowstone, the Grand Tetons and others.\\"  Pass it on!	2002-06-19

She was involved with the \\"Second Team\\" of the Symbionese Liberation Army in California in the 1970's. (Most of the \\"First Team,\\" who kidnapped Patty Hearst, was killed in a shoot-out with the LAPD in 1974.) There were bank robberies. There was a bomb placed underneath a police car.<br /><br />Time passed.<br /><br />In Minnesota on June 16, 1999, Sara Jane Olson, community activist, community theater actress, and doctor's wife in  Highland Park, \\"one of St. Paul's most upscale neighborhoods,\\" was arrested by a cadre of law enforcement personnel while driving her minivan, and extradited to California to stand trial as Soliah for alleged sins of the 70's.<br /><br />This is an intriguing part of Americana. But this book does not do it justice. Nor is the reader left, in the end, with a clear picture of whether justice has been done.<br /><br />Ms. Soliah is introduced in the beginning of the book, but then she all but disappears until \\"Act III\\" at  page 113.  In this interim, the author attempts to offer an historical context of the times.<br /><br />From her picture in the back of the book, suburban Twin Cities author Sharon Darby Hendry looks like she might be a part of the Baby Boomer generation- but from the way she describes the era, this reader did not get the sense that Hendry was THERE.  If she was alive during these turbulent times, one gets the impression that she was busy procuring pedicures at the Edina Dayton's and attending Tupperware® parties.  It's in the nuances and simple things.  For instance: Arlo Guthrie's anthem \\"Alice's Restaurant\\" is directly quoted as \\"you could get anything you wanted there\\" (p.12)  Uh, not exactly. I guess you had to be there. Ok, all you Boomers out there, Start singing! \\"You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.\\"<br /><br />Chicago Mayor Richard J.

His 17 year old mother, Mary Martin, was a perpetual Peter Pan, who did not want to grow up.  After a stint as a TV astronaut with a Jeannie in a bottle, Larry finally made it over to Dallas. Here's what he says about his autobiography: \\"In this book I'm going to describe how I did my best. A lot already has been said about me. I've been described as the Mad Monk of Malibu, the kooky actor in the caftan who led flag parades up and down the beach, didn't speak on Sundays, and occasionally roared up to the grocery store on a Harley while dressed in a yellow chicken suit. It's also no secret that I'm a recovering alcoholic whose life has been prolonged by a liver transplant.  It's all true, but there's more to say, lots more. Some of it's funny, some of it's serious, and some contains the wisdom that comes from discovering that having it all doesn't mean you *actually* have it all.  In writing this book, I decided to throw all that mumbo in the gumbo, to stir in the stories, the little-known details, and the lessons I've learned, and I wanted to do it before I couldn't remember it anymore or we destroy the planet, whichever comes first.\\"<br />Larry Hagman shines through and co-writer Todd Gold doesn't get in the way.  \\"As I see it, I've spent much of my life in the business of crowd control. Each night, millions of people are at home staring at a box, and I'm inside it. If they weren't watching TV, they'd be outside rioting in the streets, breaking windows, and overturning police cars.  I help keep them sedated, and at the same time I help sell cars, aspirin, deodorant, and feminine hygiene products. So far I've been pretty good at it. ... I even take a little credit for helping bring down the Eastern bloc.\\"<br />That's not all faux bravado. As an amateur philosopher/sociologist, the \\"man in the hat\\" does a pretty fair job that'd make Marshall McLuhan proud..  While filming episodes of *Dallas* on-location in Moscow, Larry, a/k/a J. R. Ewing, \\"Walked around the city unrecognized. It felt great to be anonymous again. I walked leisurely through museums and churches without being stopped once for an autograph.

This book is not. It was a chore to try to slog through Tosche's tome (572 pages in the library's hardcover edition - with Notes, Source list, Discography, and Index).  His officious, dense, non sequitur syle (which was not Dean's style at all) gets in the way of the story.  Like this: \\"The polyglot sound of it all, the Babel of the mob, merged in the breezes. In a town like Steubenville [Ohio] in 1917, the year Dino Crocetti was born, one could hear it ... It was not the free verse of *The Waste Land* that informed the mythology of the mob. A literature of freer prose already had risen to serve them, beginning with *Photoplay* in 1911. The reign of mediocrity - democracy- was flowering full ... America alone among nations had conceived of her destiny as a dream. The American Dream, she called it. Now dreams as well as steel were her industry. Hard-girdered reality and flickering, lilting fantasy were the inhalation and exhalation of her being. It was her dreamland stars, not her statesmen or poets, through whom she found expression.\\" ( pp.29-32)<br />I did not tough this tome out long enough for Jerry Lewis' entrance - let alone exit.

OK, yes, yes, we got it.<br />And ( 3) Martha as the harbinger of  our hosts competition?<br />Around 1975, she set about building her catering business on her own. A clothing shop for a newly emerging fashion retailer named Ralph Lauren  a designer with a talent for self-promotion- had opened in Westport and Martha had a plan. She talked the owners of the store into letting her sell homemade pies and cakes from a table by the door. The arrangement foreshadowed a business strategy that would emerge twenty years later when the Starbucks, Inc. coffee chain began opening shops in [a Broad National chain of ] bookstores around the country to catch the foot traffic of browsers looking for a place to rest and thumb a magazine or book.

Read it while cooking up a big feast or nuking a quick snack.  There is an excellent Index in which the reader may browse for specific items. As the author explains in the Introduction: \\"This is not a book of cookery - it offers no expert recipes - it is meant [to explain] the nature of our foods, what they are made of and where they came from, how they are transformed by cooking, when and why particular culinary habits took hold. Chemistry and biology figure prominently in this approach, but science is by no means the whole story.  History, anthropology, and etymology also contribute to our understanding of food and cooking.\\"<br />This is an essential treatise on the *science* - not art - of cooking. It explores *how* the traditional techniques (recipes and routines) work.  We might have known the principle, but never put it together in the concept of Kitchen. For instance: that ugly \\"skin\\" when heating milk or reheating a cappuccino: \\"Whether fluid milk is used to make a soup or a sauce, scalloped potatoes or hot chocolate, the tendency of its proteins to coagulate can cause problems.  The skin that forms on the surface of boiled milk or cream soups is a  complex of casein and calcium and results from evaporation of water at the surface and the subsequent concentration of protein there.\\"<br />To me, this is WAY more palatable than that Organic Chem 101 text with which I happily parted years ago.

A life-long control freak, Jake's proclivity to rage was exacerbated by old age dementia and Alzheimer's. He was not a good candidate to be his own caretaker, let alone to have caretaking responsibility for his ailing wife. Having driven away his son years ago, Jacqueline is, basically, an only child dealing with co-dependent aging parents.<br />This reader is a die-hard Cub fan , and so is familiar with the major tenets (no not pennants - we haven't had one of those since 1945!) of martyrdom, but Holy Cow! This woman put up with more [stuff](literally and figuratively) than I would or could. Of course, most of us could not abandon our own lives for 9+ months in physical residence - and then the daily myriad phone calls (& concomitant bills) thereafter with the live-in caretaker, the \\"Amazing Ariana\\" - should we be so fortunate as to actually be blessed with such a Saint.<br />The book, which could be gloomier that a bleak Russian novel, is rescued by Jackie's sense of humour. She intimately shares her trials and triumphs with the reader, who becomes engrossed in the saga (continued on the author's website.) The story is compelling and the insights and references indispensable. For instance - fear and frustration at transient loss of memory and orientation often trigger an outburst. (\\"Rage, rage against the dying of the light!\\") The calm reassurance that the parent is just having a fleeting bout of the dementia, will often stave off a full-scale blowout.<br />If you are of an age where you know the words to the original uncut version of InnaGoddaDivida, you probably either already need this book to understand a relative or you're going to need it soon.

Many of the previous books expose over-development of the Florida landscape. Basket Case has serious points to make too - about the current state of the newspaper wing of the 4th Estate. Haissen, a longtime newspaperman himself, knows wherefrom he speaks. And what he's saying is that we're losing the Woodward /Bernstein caliber to sell more Cheerios and Gucci loafers, and make a larger profit for the paper at the expense of a less-informed public.  Because of the cut-backs, Jack's  paper could only afford to send a reporter to alternating City Council meetings.  So, on the \\"off\\" week, when the reporter was away ...  \\"For the corrupt politicians in our circulation area, it was a dream come true.

It was flatter than a bottle of cheap New Year's Eve champagne left uncorked `til past St. Valentine's Day. No zip. No fizz.<br />Just a little over 1/3 of the way through this book, I said to myself: \\"Hmmm, self, it appears obvious what is afoot here. Or, peradventure, is the author throwing in a school of red herring?\\" Alas, amongst all the exotic animals in this tale of an over-privileged, \\"slow\\" boy-man accused of murder in Marin County, there is not a red herring to be had. What you read is what you get. At least there is some mystery to the genealogy of the other case being worked. The conflicting Point of View between Emma - the boss and owner of the P.I. agency, and Billie - her younger, new hire P.I. in-training, is good. But ultimately this is a mediocre mystery by an author who is usually much better. \\"I'd Rather Be in Philadelphia!\\"	2002-01-28

I liked part two (Bitterroot) of James Lee Burke&#8217;s Billy Bob Holland saga so well that I gave this first part a listen on unabridged audio.  Boy howdy, Billy Bob gets better with age!<br />Cimarron Rose is our introduction Billy Bob Holland, an attorney/former Texas Ranger (the Law Enforcement kind &#8211; not G.W.&#8217;s former baseball team) and his friends and relatives, including his dead ranger partner, L.Q. Navarro, for whose death Billy Bob, a &#8220;river-baptized&#8221; Baptist turned Roman Catholic, feels all the guilt that the latter can impose.<br />The plot exposes small-town caste sociology to the light - without proselytizing - like Stephen King did in the horror venue with  &#8220;Carrie.&#8221; But what&#8217;s up with Great-grandpa&#8217;s journal?  This reader doesn&#8217;t see the point - except to exploit the extreme predjudices of the period against Native Americans.  The author&#8217;s forays (via excerpts from an old journal) into Billy Bob&#8217;s outlaw/preacher great-grandfather&#8217;s lust for the &#8220;savage&#8221; Cimarron Rose, and concomitant self-hatred, seem superfluous and gratuitous.<br />Burke&#8217;s writing is superb. At one point I just had to stop and write down a quote. Billy Bob (the tale is written in the first-person) is telling us about his Daddy, who had gone nearly blind as a welder. Then, &#8220;Clarity of sight&#8221; came only when he was welding &#8220;and saw again the flame that was as pure to him as the cathedrals bells were to the deaf bell-ringer Quasimodo.&#8221;<br />This tour of Burke&#8217;s Deaf Smith County, Texas is well worth the trip.

Nonetheless, this is a gripping interstate pageturner: vindictive ex-husband hires the Three Stooges to eliminate his ex-wife. In no surprise to the Rule faithful, truth, justice and the American Way prevail and the \\"bad guys\\" are put away.<br />I was struck by Ms. Rule's judgmental attitude. (Maybe she's always been this way, & I've just never noticed before.) Briefly, here was the situation: once upon a time, Sheila Leigh Walsh married Allen Van Houte Blackthorne. Unbeknownst to her at the time, Allen was a very mean and nasty man. Allen and Sheila had two daughters together: Stevie Nicks and Daryl Hannah. Sheila divorced Allen. He was one of those \\"If I can't have you, no one else is going to either\\" guys. Sheila found true love and happiness when she remarried - Jamie Bellush - and they had quadruplets. Ms. Rule consistently vilifies Jamie (husband #2) for his post-murder reluctance to take in his stepdaughter, Daryl. Now, this man is grieving the loss of his wife and soulmate, the mother of their quadruplets. He is raising the toddler quads, along with his other stepdaughter, Stevie. On the other hand, Daryl had Mom arrested for phony \\"child abuse\\" and later, when the family was hiding for their very lives from the monstrous ex-husband, tells her Daddy where to find Mommy. I wouldn't be welcoming the little brat into my household with open arms either!<br />I was also stuck by how frequently Ms. Rule panders in her descriptions of major players. I suspect that all these \\"handsome\\" and \\"beautiful\\" and \\"highly-intelligent\\" adjectives are not so much to tell the current tale as to entice prospective interviewees in the next book(s) to agree to participate.<br />Rule needs a better fact checker - or, in this book centered in San Antonio, Texas, at least an editor with a passing familiarity with the Spanish language. She says \\"San Antonio is the seat of Bexar County, and the pronunciation of Bexar gives a newcomer away. Natives say 'Bear County,' because the X is said to have once been the center of a cattle brand and is not a letter at all. Strangers say 'Bex-ar.'\\" (p.78) Um, not exactly. As she later concedes in the narrative, Texas was originally part of Mexico. That means many places have Spanish names - like Mexico, Texas, Bexar - and, in the original pronunciation, x=h. Over time,with non-Spanish speakers, the puff of air required for the \\"h\\" sound has been dropped from usage - making the h silent, as in British Cockney English.<br />Despite the distractions, Rule is still very good at what she does and it's a very good book.er away.

I have noticed, when reading British books, that my mid-western USA mind is sometimes totally befuddled. This handy-dandy British English-American English Dictionary is a great companion and fun to read!  Written with wit and humor (or is that humour?) it also illuminates how the differences came to be:<br />\\"The early settlers in the U.S. had no verbal contact with the folk they left behind in England, and the division of the language began. Over the years many Europeans settled in the U.S., bringing their languages with them. English remained the dominant language in America, though German was widely spoken in the 1800's. There were numerous French colonies, and New York was originally a Dutch settlement, called New Amsterdam. Each language left its mark on spoken English [this reviewer would here note that Native languages also enhance American English] ...<br />Noah Webster, the well known American lexicographer, forecast in 1789 that eventually American English would be as different from British English as Dutch, Danish and Swedish are from German, or from each other.\\" p. 1-2<br />But with improved transportation and communication, British and American English have remained close enough to cause confusion.

The reader is introduced to Jack Morgan, the aforementioned D.A., with whom Kate had an affair before leaving his employ in Anchorage to return home to the environs and inhabitants of her native Village and Park. The characters and locale will become old familiar friends as this series wends on.<br />The introduction to Jack Morgan is particularly resonant:\\"He looked like John Wayne ready to run the claim jumpers off his gold mine on that old White Mountain just a little southeast of  Nome, if John Wayne had been outfitted by Eddie Bauer.\\" (If you are clueless about the humour, I suggest you go over to videos and get a copy of the movie \\"North to Alaska\\" - pay attention to the song being sung during the credits.)  That Johnny Horton song is on jukeboxes everywhere here in our part of the Tundra, and everybody sings along ;-)  And, speaking of jukeboxes and bars, the scene at Bernie's Bar in the book is really a hoot!<br />Along the way to finding out what happened to the Ranger and his would-be rescuer, Stabenow gives the reader an overview of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and life in the villages.

The writing was taut and initially moved right along, but ended up \\"all dressed up with no place to go.\\"  This is not really a book about St. Paul - but rather St. Paul is a backdrop for this mostly tragic with only a glimmer of comic story.  The older brother reminds me of the older brother on the television series \\"The Wonder Years.\\"  Other than St. Paul street names, the major local tie-in is the Minnesota Twins, which, in a bizarre quirk of fate subsequent to the publication of this bleak novel, are probably doomed as well (if Bud Seilig has his way and his \\"contraction\\" is allowed to erase the Twins from existence.)<br />Mr. Walker, the most \\"adult\\" member of this cast, proposes a toast to \\"Joy in Mudville\\" with his empty Coke can in hand.  That's as good as this book gets.  Better bet: \\"Until They Bring the Streetcars Back\\" by Stanley Gordon West.	2002-01-02

I approached it with some trepidation, though, as it is written by \\"Award-winning Wisconsin sportswriters,\\" and published in Madison, Wisconsin. But the foreward is written by a nice man from the Chicago Tribune and I found the book to be fairly evenly balanced.  The style is easily readable - not in chronological order but arranged by interesting topics. For the chronically chronologically-oriented, there is an appended game-by-game synopsis from the first meeting of the Staleys (who soon became Da Bears) and the Packers on November 27, 1921 to the 152nd meeting at the end of the 1996 season.  There are many clever turns of phrase - for instance, the rivalry as \\"uncivil war,\\" or \\"Once again, Ditka had added insult on top of victory.\\"<br />These meetings are not just games, they are \\"events.\\" As the authors tell us, \\"The Catholic churches in Green Bay recognized in short time what kind of impact the rivalry had on people's lives. By 1928, St. Mary's parish had scheduled a special mass at 5:15 Sunday morning, so fans could catch the early train to Chicago.\\"<br />Chapter 5 is entitled \\"Hard-Edged Names in Hard-Nosed Games\\" and begins:  \\"The seven men to which this chapter is devoted had two things in common. One was that their names didn't roll off the tongue, but rattled around in the mouth and forced their way through the teeth. Hard-edged names, full of consonants and resonance.\\"  Names that were uttered in hushed reverential or loud cursing tones at family gatherings.  (My family straddles both sides of the Illinois-Wisconsin line so it depends on which part of the family was talking ;-). Names like Nagurski, Nitschke, Butkus and Ditka. The chapter tells inquiring minds &quot;what ever happened to&quot; these guys too.<br />Bear/Packer  \\"games\\" are not genteel affairs.  Here's a recap of the November 4, 1945 encounter (before mouthgaurds and sturdy helmets.) \\"Packers halfback Roy McKay suffered a broken nose and had several teeth knocked lose. Halfback Irv Comp suffered a knee injury, and tackle Baby Ray sustained a one-inch cut on his upper lip. Guard Pete Tinsley was thrown out of the game for punching Bears quarterback Sid Luckman, and Goodnight also was sent to the showers for punching Hoptowit.  The Bears casualty list included rookie halfback John Morton, who visited the Illinois Masonic Hospital to have a cut under his eye stitched, and, of course, Artoe.  With one well-placed elbow, in the final two minutes of the game, Keuper broke Artoe's upper and lower jaws, along with his nose, and knocked out 11 teeth.\\" (p. 68)  Now, THAT'S smash-mouth football!<br />The chapter  \\"Twenty Memorable Games\\" includes \\"Prelude to a [Bears] Title\\" - November 17, 1963; Wrigley Field (yes, we played there for a long time before moving over to Soldier Field - there's a whole other chapter on the playing fields: \\" Sacred Fields Forever.\\")  \\"No professional football game in Chicago, before or since, has been more eagerly awaited than was the dramatic 1963 showdown between the two-time defending NFL champion Packers and the grimly determined Bears. Both teams entered the game with 8-1 records, and the winner clearly would have the inside track to the Western Conference championship. Green Bay had won eight straight games since the season-opening, 10-3 defeat to the Bears. Chicago had lost only to San Francisco.  The Monday before the game, the Bears placed fifteen hundred standing room tickets on sale. The tickets, priced at $2.50 [no - that's not a typo- that's two dollars and fifty cents!] sold out in forty minutes.\\"  (pages 133-134)<br />And stuff you probably never knew: \\"As Bears running back Brian Piccolo [remember Brian Piccolo? If not, stop reading this review and rush over to Video/DVD to get a copy of \\"Brian's Song\\"  - not the recent re-make, but the excellent 1970 version with James Caan &amp; Billy Dee Williams.  It puts the lie to the myth \\"real men don't cry.\\"] \\"As  ... Brian Piccolo lay on his deathbed in June, 1970, his body ravaged by cancer, he asked to see Ed McCaskey, the son-in-law of George Halas and a close family friend. McCaskey had been assigned by Halas to take care of Piccolo's every need.  He had been there to support the player and his wife, Joy, many times in those terrible final months.  So McCaskey caught the first train from Chicago to New York and went straight to the Sloan-Ketterling Cancer Center. He had steeled himself for the inevitable, but the sight of Piccolo, in horrific pain and gasping for breath, was more than he could bear. \\"I looked at him and tears burst from my eyes, involuntarily,\\" McCaskey said. \\"Brian saw that and said, `Don't worry, Big Ed, I'm not afraid of anything - only Nitschke.'\\" He died that day.\\" (p. 114)<br />The pictures in this book alone are well worth the price of the book.  Sure, more would be better, but they are great just the same.  My favorite, the final one, is Coach Ditka wearing his SuperBowl XX championship leather jacket as he \\"watches from the sidelines during a Bears-Packers game. The Bears won fifteen of twenty games against the Packers during Ditka's stint as head coach from 1982 - 1992.\\"<br />I could gush on and on about this great book on a great rivalry. But I have to go wrap my Dad's present.  So why don't you just buy it and read it all yourself! You betcha I will!to the myth \\"real men don't cry.\\"] \\"As  ...

As in the previous books, there's a whole lot of coffee and donuts being consumed ;-) It could be subtitled: \\"Known Dead - Book II.\\"  I sure am glad that I read \\"the Big Thaw\\" immediately following \\"Known Dead\\" and  strongly urge you to also get and read the former first because  \\"The Big Thaw,\\" more than other serial procedurals, is a continuation of the saga started last time, and it really helps to know the players and have them fresh in your mind.<br />This time, there are some dead burglars at the home of \\"snowbird\\" farmers.  Deputy Houseman is on the case. His Cohort, Hester Gorse, is stationed on the floating casino on the Mississippi. Volont and Gabriel are back as foiIs.  Readers on  \\"the Coasts\\" may get a warped view of the Heartland with Harstad's  sustained focus on militant extremists who are actually a minute portion of the mostly hard-working and level-headed folks that produce our nation's food.

You need not have read his first, 11 Days, to enjoy this one. In fact, the author does you a favor by starting this one out:  \\"My name is Carl Houseman. I'm a deputy sheriff in Nation County, Iowa.\\" (In 11 Days, the reader just kept hoping through 1/2 the book for someone to call the first-person narrator by his name! No &quot; Call me Ishmael&quot; there. ;-)<br />The book has the humour and self-effacing good nature of many rural mid-western law enforcement folks.  It starts out rather slowly, like a languid Iowa summer heat wave. A drug enforcement agent is murdered in a marijuana patch in Houseman's home county.  \\" `DEA said it (the cultivation of this particular type of plant) couldn't be done in this climate.' I smiled. `Iowa farm boys can grow just about anything on a slab of concrete. Kind of makes you proud.' \\" The plot eventually thickens to an outcrop of \\"Posse Comitatus\\" type militants.<br />Here's another wry observation from an author who knows \\"who-of\\" he speaks: \\"I'd worked fraud cases before, but it had been my experience that the average Iowa farmer would read a speil like that one and spit on the shiny shoes that tried to sell it to him. Politely, of course. Maybe even apologetically. But he'd spit accurately, nonetheless. Herman must have been a little short of saliva one day.\\"<br />The coffee's still on and it's another good read!	2001-12-04

I listened to the unabridged audio version while traveling the highways and biways of the Upper Midwest. The reader, Tom Stechschulte, is a joy to hear.  The voicing of the characters is fine!  And what a cast of characters it is: Billy Bob Holland, an attorney/former Texas Ranger (the Law Enforcement kind - not G.W.'s  former baseball team) and his friends and relatives along with foils including white supremicists, semi-unemployed mafioso, despoilers of the environment, \\"Tree-huggers,\\" and a sociopathically sinister rodeo clown.<br />The problem with *listening* to James Lee Burke's writing while driving down the highway is that it would be detrimental to oneself and one's fellow travelers to attempt to contemporaneously write down some of the linguistic jewels one encounters. One zinger was a comment on a particularly syrupy Okie drawl of which, to the best of my recollection, Burke said, \\"If Shakespeare had heard such a permutation of the English language, Old Will would have written all his stuff in Mandarin Chinese!\\"<br />Another drawback of *listening* while driving is that one cannot pause, in the middle of the freeway, to draw charts with circles and arrows to keep clear on who is affilliated with whom, who offed whom, and why.  But it was an excellent sojourn in Montana, and I encourage you to take the trip.  As a special bonus extra tape, the Unabridged Audio version (I got this at my local library) has a very interesting and illuminating interview with the intelligent and hyper-articulate James Lee Burke. I will definitely be going back and listening to Stechschulte's racountment of this gang's first  adventure: \\"Cimarron Rose.\\" Enjoy!	2001-11-28

Everybody look what's going down.	On a May night in 1984, the residents in a Gulfport, Florida, neighborhood heard the dying screams of Karen Gregory. Most of them did nothing. One of them had already done too much.<br />I just read the &#8220;St. Martin&#8217;s True Crime Classics&#8221; (2001) version of this book.  It *is* a classic and the designation of &#8220;Classic&#8221; and the reprint is well justified. The writing style is quite good, it flows along within the conventions of the genre without getting in the way of the tale.  Here&#8217;s a sample, which preceeds Part One in the &#8220;Classic&#8221; edition (Maybe not in the previous ed., as it is not included in the sample pages here on Amazon&#8217;s Item Page at the time I write this review):<br />&#8220;She lay alone in the hall for a night and a day and another night. Finally someone saw her, and the police arrived and raised a circle of official yellow around the yard, and the neighbors stepped forward with their excuses, then retreated behind the walls of their front doors. The forensic experts came, and the forensic experts left, and at last the case was left in the hands of one who would not let go. During the day he would sit at his desk, examining and reexamining the photos of her on the floor, and ask her to help him see whatever he had missed. At night he would return to the house, wandering inside, hoping the empty rooms might reveal whatever they remembered. The weeks stretched into months.  He eliminated one suspect after the other and ran down one blind alley after the other, and still he was no closer to understanding, until that day he stumbled across a single moment of stupid good luck.  Then came the lie detector tests at the station, and the reenactments in the dark, and the anonymous phone calls that could not be traced, and the rounds of weary accusations and denials.<br />After all of that, he arrested a man and put him on trial for this life.<br />An investigator asked on of the neighbors:<br />&#8220;Does he look like a murdered to you?&#8221;<br />The neighbor said:<br />&#8220;What does a murdered look like?&#8221;<br />The book includes photographs to answer that question.

Some things, unfortunately, do not change. He says: \\"About one in seven vets get sued in their first year in practice.\\" Ouch!<br />Are there no laws or regulations governing the release of waste over there? Our new vet and longer-term surfer says: \\" I tried out a little reef break off the headland called \\"sewer pipe\\" by the locals, for obvious reasons.

I concur with that evaluation.  Nothing I have heard in the briefings or in our discussions has caused me to change my mind.  We are trapped in a quagmire that we have created for ourselves. At some point when the public realizes how it has been deceived there will be a demand that someone be blamed.  I don't believe there will be any point in a search for blame. Every administration since 1945 made decisions which led with a high degree of probability to the present situation.  We could have blocked the French when they tried to return to Indochina after the war. We could have refused to support them in their war against the Vietminh. We could have declined to assume responsibility for that part of the world when they left. We might have refused to send more military assistance in the first year of the Kennedy administration. Yet we did none of these things, indeed we barely considered them. Our decisions about Vietnam were as natural and as logical as our decisions about Greece and Turkey immediately after the war and about Korea in 1950. What is done is done.\\" p.192<br /> And the response?<br />\\"However, let it be recorded that on the Ides of March in 1968, the Senior Advisers told [LBJ] that the war could not be won.

I found the E-Mails throughout the book to be disconcerting, thinking: Besides the text, what am I supposed to be looking at?  The sender?  The addressee? The mailing list?<br />SEMI-SPOILER: If you haven't read the book yet, stop reading this review NOW.  I was also confused about Jimmy's aunt's name: Faye Doebler-Ingram. I thought maybe it would turn out to be of major import, but, in the end, it is mere error.  Faye is Clara's  sister.  Clara married into the Doebbler family and name. Faye, on the other hand, is referred to as a spinster and tells us \\"I never married.\\" So, she would not have her sister's married name as part of her own.  Riordan &amp; his editors might have wasted away on one too many margaritas?<br />Anyway, it's a fun book and well worth a read.	2001-10-02

His white hair had a slightly greasy tinge to it, and his upper body, once that of a football player, had swollen up over his belt buckle until it bore an uncanny resemblance to a Dilly Bar.<br />Take away the glitz and the tourist dollars and the Paseo del Rio is basically a deep trench that winds through the center of downtown San Antonio. ... Put back the glitz and the tourist dollars, and even a native has to admit it's pretty impressive. ... Tourists with cameras and souvenir sombreros, basic trainees on leave, rich men with high-priced call girls, all happily stepping on toes and spilling drinks on each other.  This is what a San Antonian thinks of when you say \\"river.\\" I remember how much trouble I had reading Huck Finn as a child, trying to imagine how the hell that raft made it past all those restaurants and crowds, in water only three feet deep and thirty feet across, without anybody noticing the stowaway slave. Maybe that's why I became an English major - sheer confusion.\\"	2001-09-28

If you haven't, this is probably not the place to start - as the author trusts that we have remembered his unforgettable characters sufficiently that pains are not taken to re-introduce them.<br /> Money, Money, Money, published in August, 2001, is his first foray into the murky world of international terrorism. .  Here are some disconcerting excerpts. For reasons perhaps now lost, way back 50 books ago the author re-named the New York City boroughs and other areas for purposes of his tales:<br />\\"The drive to Calm's Point took him half an hour  from the North Side of the city to the bridge and over it into a community only recently reclaimed from urban decay. Hillside Commons consisted of low-rise tenements which had been inhabited by runaway hippies during the Sixties and Seventies, immigrant Hispanics in the early Eighties, Koreans in the Nineties, and now - here in the bright new millennium - upwardly mobile Yuppies yearning for a glimpse of the distant towers across the River Dix.  p. 80<br />\\"He had been trained in Afghanistan, was said to have links with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad.\\" p. 159<br />\\"It was his own belief that only MAJOR attacks of terrorism would leave any impression at all on the forces of evil polluting the Arab world. Only desperation measures would provoke wholesale departures. The withdrawal of all U.S. and western forces from Moslem countries in general and from the Arabian Peninsula in particular was the stated goal of al Quaida. Killing all Americans, including civilians, everywhere in the world was merely a means toward this end. p. 162<br />Some prior reviewers have said that the plot in this newest 87th Precinct tale is too much of a stretch.  I suggest that maybe things might have been different on September 11, 2001 if more Security Personnel, Air Traffic Controllers and passengers had read Tom Clancy novels.  Would they have acted differently?<br />The ending in this installment of the 87th Precinct saga leaves a lot of loose ends and one wonders if sequels  will undergo change in light of the recent events, which have, forever and ill, redefined our view of the possibility and extent of evil.<br />God Bless America.differently?<br />The ending in this installment of the 87th Precinct saga leaves a lot of loose ends and one wonders if sequels  will undergo change in light of the recent events, which have, forever and ill, redefined our view of the possibility and extent of evil. <br />God Bless America.	2001-09-27

In a time when June Cleaver wore chic dresses and real pearls everyday to wash & wax the kitchen floor, the author expects us to believe that one of the main characters is a FEmale judge and another main female character intends to go to law school?

I mean, you never saw Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple turning primly away from those who unexpectedly ingested cyanide. Kinsey Millhone didn't run for the can with a hand clamped over her mouth every time she came across a gunshot wound. Even Cecil Younger, a sort of ordinary small-town guy, seemed able to view bodily remains with a calm resignation that was more sad than anything else. They were able to see the unspeakable and process the unimaginable and unravel the Gordian Knot every ten months or so (depending on publishing schedules,) and most of them seemed no worse for the wear (well, Cecil got battered about a bit, but he persevered too.)<br />I suppose that the operative word here is FICTIONAL.<br />Writers can make up whatever they want, and their poor creations have no choice but to deal with the overflow. That's how it works in fiction. Characters discover bodies, they investigate deaths, and they solve mysteries and then enjoy a bit of downtime between each installment.<br />In real life, you'd never expect to find an overweight, widowed, caf&eacute; owner in a small plains town, unfortunate to have tripped over (in one way or another) six bodies (several at her place of business) in less than seven months.<br />I doubt you'd expect her to have been able to solve the underlying mystery of each of those deaths in short order while simultaneously trying to sort out her decidedly messy personal life and support herself in the trailer-house manner to which she'd become accustomed.And you'd certainly not expect her to have to face the whole process again barely a month after the last grizzly discovery.<br />If I was reading the story of my life, I'd have a hard time believing it myself.<br />Welcome to my world.\\"<br /><br />That's how Tory Bauer, reluctant and self-effacing heroine of Kathleen Taylor's excellent mystery series, describes herself in the newest visit with her and the folks in Delphi, South Dakota.

One would think that a book which purports to be about the interpersonal relationships between Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Farina & Richard Farina would tell one all about the background for Joans Diamonds and Rust. One would be wrong. A much more detailed and interesting account is found in Howard Soundes recent bio of Bob: Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan. (see my review.) Hajdus book is OK, but a fluff piece of the People Magazine verite. One is reminded of Jeff Goldblums smarmy character in The Big Chill (a movie I rate Six Stars out of Five!) who works for one of these tabloid-type ventures. He says that their editorial rule is, assuming a lot of people read their magazine while tending to other business in the bathroom, to never write an article that takes the average person longer to read than the average .... Hajdu worked for Entertainment Weekly and is apparently guided by this editorial philosophy. Those of us of a Certain Age, e.g the Baby Boomers at whom the book is presumably targeted , may have a hard time with the typeset/font in which the original hardcover is set.

Buttrey asked producer Bob Johnson, and received the equally strange suggestion that he play cow bell. Determined to prove how nonsensical the suggestions were, Buttrey found a beat-up cow bell and pair of bongos that looked like a souvenir from Tijuana, the skin attached with thumbtacks. (He had to run a cigarette lighter under the skin to tighten it and get a tone.) The young Kris Kristofferson was working as a janitor at the studio and Buttrey asked Kristofferson to hold the !bongos and cow bell next to his drum kit during the take. Without having worked out any drum part, the drummer got the signal they were going to record and he improvised a distinctive tick-tock introduction on bongo and cow bell that blended perfectly with the shimmer of organ and Pete Drake's steel guitar.

He walked into the Alaskan wilderness ill-prepared and did not come out alive. From my vantage point in northern Mn, my initial reaction to this trek was that Chris was insane, suicidal, or just plain dumb!<br />Author Jon Krakauer, himself an adventurer, does a good job of recreating Chris' life and motivation. Krakauer's introspection and comparison of other ill-fated adventurers helps explain Chris while neither canonizing  nor demonizing this young man and his wanderings.  The writing does not get in the way of the story (contra another book about Alaska - The Woman Who Married a Bear - which I am also reviewing today.)	2001-06-04

I was a different, a better person.  I had made discoveries, learned some important lessons. From this day forth, I was going to stop for hitch-hikers, laugh along with happy drunks in pubs, and respect the right of the bad guitarist to play along with the rest.

You don't notice them unless you're looking for them, or feeling hungry. One German McDonald's, however, stands out from the rest. It sits on a nondescript street in a new shopping complex not far from Dachau, the first concentration camp opened by the Nazis... In 1997, protests were staged against the opening of a McDonald's so close to a concentration camp where gypsies, Jews, homosexuals, and political opponents of the Nazis were imprisoned, where Luftwaffe scientists performed medical experiments on inmates and roughly 30,000 people died. The McDonald's Corporation denied that it was trying to profit from the Holocaust and said the restaurant was at least a mile from the camp.  After the curator of the Dachau Museum complained that McDonald's was distributing thousands of [these] leaflets among tourists in the camp's parking lot, the company halted the practice.\\" (p. 233, in the Chapter entitled \\"Global Realization.\\")<br /><br />The callousness of the Fast Food Industry is further illuminated by tales of  farmers and workers regarded as merely interchangeable cogs in the \\"food-industrial complex.\\"  The book itself is easily digestible- the food is not.  Here is author Eric Schlosser's description of the pervasiveness of the issues: \\"Far from being inevitable, America's fast food industry in its present form is the logical outcome of certain political and economic choices.  In the potato fields and processing plants of Idaho, in the ranchlands east of Colorado Springs, in the feedlots and slaughterhouses of the High Plains, you can see the effects of fast food on the nation's rural life, its environment, its workers, and its health. The fast food chains now stand atop a huge food-industrial complex that has gained control of American agriculture.  During the 1980's, large multinationals - such as Cargill, ConAgra, and IBP - were allowed to dominate one commodity market after another. Farmers and cattle ranchers are losing their independence, essentially becoming hired hands for the agribusiness giants or being forced off the land. Family farms are now being replaced by gigantic corporate farms with absentee owners.  Rural communities are losing their middle class and becoming socially stratified, divided between a small, wealthy elite and large numbers of the working poor.  Small towns that seemingly belong in a Norman Rockwell painting are being turned into rural ghettos. The hardy, independent farmers whom Thomas Jefferson considered the bedrock of American democracy are a truly vanishing breed. The United States now has more prison inmates than full-time farmers.  The fast food chains' vast purchasing power and their demand for a uniform product have encouraged fundamental changes in how cattle are raised, slaughtered, and processed into ground beef. These changes have made meatpacking - once a highly skilled, highly paid occupation - into the most dangerous job in the United States, performed by armies of poor, transient immigrants whose injuries often go unrecorded and uncompensated.  And the same meat industry practices that endanger these workers have facilitated the introduction of deadly pathogens, such as E. coli 0157:H7 into America's hamburger meat, a food aggressively marketed to children.\\" (p. 8-9)<br /><br />One of the most succinct and effective clauses this reader has ever read ends the following almost-indecipherable-to-the-non-scientist paragraph in the Chapter \\"What's in the Meat\\": \\"The newly recognized foodborne pathogens tend to be carried and shed by apparently healthy animals. Food tainted by these organisms has most likely come in contact with an infected animal's stomach contents or manure, during slaughter or subsequent processing. A nationwide study published by the USDA in 1996 found that 7.5 percent of the ground beef samples taken at processing plants were contaminated with Salmonella, 11.7 percent were contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, 30 percent were contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus, and 53.3 percent were contaminated with Clostridium perfringens.  All of these pathogens can make people sick: food poisoning caused by Listeria generally requires hospitalization and proves fatal in about one out of every five cases.  In the USDA study 78.6 percent of the ground beef contained microbes that are spread primarily by fecal material.  The medical literature on the causes of food poisoning is full of euphemisms and dry scientific terms; coliform levels, aerobic plate counts, sorbitol, MacConkey agar, and so on. Behind them lies a simple explanation for why eating a hamburger can now make you seriously ill: There is s**t in the meat.\\" (p. 197) [I had to ask Vanna to remove a consonant and a vowel from the common visceral word actually found in the text so as to enable this review to be accepted for posting here.]<br /><br />Then the author explains that Fast Food burger is actually safer than that found in many supermarkets and school lunch programs - because the Fast Food chains now require stricter standards of the packers whose methods they inspired - and schools and supermarkets get the leftovers.

You can hear Professor Harold Hill exhorting  \\"Oh, we got trouble, right here in River City.\\" Or, in this case, Postville, Iowa. The author,  a tenured Professor of Journalism at the University of Iowa, is originally from New Jersey and came to Iowa City via San Francisco.  He describes how this book came to be:  \\"The journalist in me had come out in full force. ... I had barely scratched the surface, but clearly there was a culture clash of the strongest magnitude between two groups, both born-and-bred Americans, who rarely had the opportunity to clash.  Here was a kind of experiment in  the limits of diversity and community, the nature of community, the meaning of prejudice, even what it means to be an American. Postville seemed like a social laboratory, perhaps a metaphor for America. \\"[81]<br />It sounded like an intriguing story - a clash between &quot;the quiet, restrained Iowans&quot; and &quot;these brash, assertive Hasidic Jews,&quot; so I read the book.  But the author's rendition is arguably more of a story than the story he purports to tell.<br />Urban-transplant author Stephen Bloom makes himself a major focus of the story. As a prior reviewer noted he  \\"reveals more about himself than the town.\\" Although he does come around some by the end of the book, I found  Mr. Bloom whiney - \\"Poor me, Poor me! Here I am [voluntarily] in the middle of the Iowa cornfields and not a decent bagel to be had!\\" Well, how about ordering some? Surely there is a website? Or ASK the local grocer to carry some of these items. (Try it - it really works!)<br />The author bemoans his perceived non-acceptance by folks in Iowa.  But one does not exactly ingratiate oneself to regional residents by referring to their home as merely  \\" fly-over country\\" [217]  or mocking their physical being. Of his first impression in Iowa City: \\"Never in my life, except Disney World, had I seen such large and such white people.  As I slid into a booth, I noticed that the space between the table and vinyl bench must have been three feet wide.  It wasn't just the abdominal girth of the hulking people around me, it was their necks, hands, fingers, arms. \\" [page 2]: \\" 'The Lubavitchers in Postville are very private people,' he said, as though lecturing a farm kid who couldn't understand the difference between median and average.\\" [p. 29] Hunh?

Indeed, they merely \\"fly\\" with what others tag them.<br />This book CAN be judged by its excellent cover.  And illustrations! There is an illustration at the beginning of each chapter, which is then repeated on the top of each page of that chapter. And a very helpful map of Oz!  It is NOT a children's book  - the Motion Picture Ratings people would probably give it an \\"R\\" because of some sexual content.  It has deep ecological, philosophical, political, sociological, and  theological axes to grind. I was reminded of my 2nd most favorite movie, \\"the Big Chill,\\" as former college friends separate and then encounter each other later on.<br />I was also reminded of an old-time computer game: Transylvania. (It came on the big old DOS floppies - remember them?)  If a player didn't pick up various tools/instruments along the way, one was doomed on down the road.  In this book, the story of the gathering of all the accoutrements of \\"witchhood\\" along Elphaba's life is sometimes happenstance and always clever.<br />Maguire is  \\"stuck\\" with Baum's unfortunate or fortuitous - depending on point of view - end to \\"the Wicked Witch of the West.\\" But that ending isn't really an ending to this revisionist Oz World Maguire has created . There are many \\"loose ends.\\" What becomes of Liir?  It cries out for a sequel.	2001-02-24

The tapes are a richer experience, as one is drawn in by the brothers McCourt recounting their own tales - the joyous lilting highs and the flat out lows.<br />Included is a description of Angela's death by BINGO (in Malachy's inimitable style, he attributes this almost-addiction to the beginning of her end) and discourse on such diverse matters as Nixon, VietNam, conservatism amongst Irish-Americans, and the care of the mentally ill and developmentally disabled.<br />I heartily recommend it!	2001-02-07

Barnum  said \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\"  and it appears that the Ramseys have found a big one in former F.B.I. profiler and \\"Mindhunter\\" John Douglas.  If you buy this book, then maybe Douglas has found one too.  If you are intellectually curious about this book, but don't want to be part of  P.T.`s prophesy, borrow it from the library (as I did) or read it in a book store while sipping a fine cappucino.<br />  The foundation of American criminal jurisprudence is that one is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  But that does not require a totally gullible populace.  It appears that John Douglas has gone quite daft - all Patsy had to do was bat those \\"Runner-up-beauty-queen\\" eyes at him.  Patsy is a former Miss West Virginia, a state where they say such things as \\"Use that good southern common sense of yours.\\" (Coincidentally (?) a phrase from the \\"ransom note\\" - See also \\"Author Unknown - On the Trail of Anonymous\\" by Donald W. Foster.)<br />There's another colloquialism they have in the south: \\"That dog won't hunt!\\" Despite reliance on his previous books and the first part of this one, Douglas' rationalizations around the Ramseys won't hunt.<br />The first part of the book is ostensibly a tour through historic crimes from a profiler's point of view.  These portions are interesting and often, for instance his views on Lawrencia (Bambi) Bembenick and Albert DeSalvo,  make more sense than the \\"conventional wisdom.\\"  But when the reader arrives at the chapter on JonBenet Ramsey's murder, it becomes clear that the authors' objective throughout was to buttress his Ramsey rationalizations - for example: \\"As we saw in the Lindbergh case...\\"<br />Dr. Sam Sheppard's case  is employed as a \\"cautionary tale\\" in Douglas' Ramsey rationalizations. (p. 310)  The tragedy of  the Sheppard family is written by Dr. Sam's son in \\"Mockery of Justice: the True Story of the Sheppard Murder Case.\\"  The Sheppard book is also available here on Amazon.com and is, IMHO, a more prudent investment.<br />John Douglas blows his own horn that he is no longer being paid by the Ramseys.  But he is selling this book.  So, remember what P.T. Barnum said!, a more prudent investment.  <br />John Douglas blows his own horn that he is no longer being paid by the Ramseys.

Although the authors' statistical methodology may not be perfect, the anecdotal material is hard-hitting. We are not talking mischievous hijinx here.  This is some serious stuff.  Why is this going on? Why isn't the NFL doing anything?  Here are some excerpts:<br />A featured player's PR guy says: \\"But he's not any different than a lot of the other guys.  He's a highly emotional kind of person, like a lot of ballplayers.  You don't become a professional football player without a high level of testosterone running through your body.\\"[p. 38]<br />The counselor whom the Cleveland Browns asked to counsel an alleged abuser and his fiance told her:  \\"This is [his] lifestyle.  He goes out every week and has to basically try to punish people on the field.  He'll go after them and try to kill them. A lot of times he can't relate to coming home and not doing that to you when he's upset.\\" [p. 153-154]<br />Rev. Jesse Jackson says: \\"By and large, we are seeing the end result of a long line of exploitation... Men being used who come out of very desperate straits, having extraordinary, exploitable, commercial talent.  They are put on a pedestal in high school, removed from the earth and its responsibilities.  Then they are recruited by the top colleges ...  and study less difficult subject matter because they are actually working [for the universities.] These guys have been exploited from the time it was obvious they could jump higher and run faster. Athletes of stature don't walk on the ground and are allowed to play by different rules. Once their use is gone, they are no longer protected. But while they are playing ball, much of their behavior is cushioned. They are insulated from regular rules, attending classes, adhering to regular socializing processes.\\" [p. 170]<br />So what's the solution?  One would be tempted to try to dissuade one's children from idolizing some of the poor role models in the NFL for a kinder, gentler sport like figure skating.  But then there's Tonya Harding.arding.	2001-01-26

The dust jacket on the hardcover is apropos.  It has a picture of a bleeding Munchkin with a dagger through his heart lying on the Yellow Brick Road.<br />It's November 1, 1940.

Tobias Leo Pevsner, (a/k/a Toby Peters) P.I. is on the case for MGM.  (MGM wants to control publicity spin and avoid official police \\"blue tape.)<br />The book, written by a Northwestern University film professor, is a take-off on the \\"hard-boiled\\" detective sagas of an earlier age.  In a hilarious plot twist, Toby stumbles on some guy he's never heard of who claims to be a writer of detective stories.  The guy's name?  \\"Chandler, Raymond Chandler\\" who tells our hero he has written a couple of books: \\"The Big Sleep\\" and \\"Farewell, My Lovely\\" - neither of which our hero has ever heard of either.  Nonetheless,  Mr. Chandler becomes his sometime partner on the case.  If you like things Oz, I recommend this book and also the movie \\"Under the Rainbow\\" - a spoof of the making of the Wizard of Oz, with Chevy Chase and Carrie Fisher trying to manage the mischievous Munchkins.	2001-01-23

There are many more \\"I\\"s  (first person narrative) in this book than in most books of the true crime genre - but that is  probably  a \\"good thing\\" as it is evident that Ms. Rule becomes deeply involved with the stories and cases which she covers. She describes herself as a  \\"fact-detective.\\" This is her 7th volume of \\"chaff\\" (cases that didn't make it into full length books) from her files. The longer title story in this compilation is the best - because the author excels at getting those close to her cases to talk to her - thereby giving her readers that \\"YOU ARE THERE\\" feeling.  Of the shorter work-ups, the case told in &quot;A Dangerous Mind&quot; is eerily prescient of the Jon Benet Ramsey case almost 20 years later - but with better crime solvers.<br />The shorter stories here are too short - depriving the reader of the author's forte.

Those who remain in town  appear to be locked in a sort of \\"time warp.\\" They maintain the harsh high school cliqued pecking order in which they were, and are, mired and \\"pigeon hole\\" returnees in their long-ago station.<br />I found myself wondering if I had been mistaken about the genre as I was reading the first part of the book.  The dead body at the center of the who-dun-it murder mystery doesn't even appear until page 167 of this 300 page work. So, for the first half of the book, the story is soap operatic a la \\"As St. Cloud Turns\\" - but that could be anticipated in a book co-authored by Judith Guest, who also penned \\"Ordinary People.\\"  The unsympathetic mother character played by Mary Tyler Moore in the Robert Redford movie of that book has aged a bit and now appears as a mother/grandmother in St. Cloud.<br />Remember old-fashioned roller coasters?

See also \\"Cream Peas on Toast\\" by the same authors,)  Glorified Rice is jello-ed, fruited rice - the recipe for which is helpfully found on page 84.  When I first saw the review of this book in the Sunday Fargo Forum (1994), I rushed right out to my local bookstore and got one. (Which was a feat in itself, as North Dakota had only relatively recently repealed the \\"Blue Laws\\" mandating that all non-food stores be closed on Sundays so as to encourage employers, employees, and the general populace to sit around all day glorifying rice and God or at least not doing anything \\"heathen\\" like going to K-Mart to pick up cleaning supplies.)<br />The gist of this hilarious and thought-provoking series is that 2  American Norwegian Lutheran farm women got together and \\"it dawned on us that the world needed us to write a few little books comparing and contrasting such things as Lutheran and Catholic ways, ... and all the baggage and trappings that go with these kinds of things.\\"<br />Here are some of their \\"findings\\":<br />&quot;They had fish frys...We had Lutefisk suppers<br />They had Patron Saints... we basically fended for ourselves.<br />They believe in the infallibility of the Pope...We believe everyone has a few bad days now and then.<br />They had the shroud of Turin ...

A depressing end to an era  eulogized in Nat King Cole's song urging all to \\"get their kicks on Route 66.\\"  The good news is that through local preservation societies all along the old Route, some of the road and attractions still exist.<br />Here's how the editor describes this compilation: \\"The mystery writers who contributed to this anthology are uniquely qualified to tell these stories, living as they do in towns and cities all along the route.  Each writer chose not only a locale (sometimes more than one; the road is essentially about movement, after all,) but a time period\\" too.<br />This book is  a murderous anthological trip through time and geography on historic US Route 66, generally in East to West order.  Some of these short stories are a good introduction to authors who I will definitely read more from and one,  (Dick Lochte,) which let me know who I don't care to investigate further.<br />All in all, it's a fun book for murder/mystery buffs and fans of the \\"Mother Road.\\"	2000-11-22

In this 3rd installment of the CCO'M series, Chucky and his family and friends are plopped into nearly as many historical situations as Forrest Gump - contriving almost to the point of breaking the suspension of disbelief. As I repeatedly state in my reviews, I dislike book reviews that give it all away. (What, then, is the point of getting the book and reading it if someone has already told you everything(!) So, I will not tell you the foreshadowing that we get at the end of this one, but it seems as though the next one is going to do the Forrest Gump plop again.<br />I eagerly anticipate new novels from Father Greeley, but this one has gone beyond the familiarly comfortable Quixotic tilting at Roman windmills to long rants about secular 20th century history. For example, here he is mid-rant on Ike's \\"I shall go to Korea: \\"<br />\\"The promise was a clever but petty public relations gesture - though more honest than Nixon's \\"secret plan\\" twenty years later to end the Vietnam War. Eisenhower could have buried poor, hapless Adlai Stevenson anyway, because the public was fed up with the war and the seeming corruption of the Truman administration. (The Communism in government issue, like the abortion debate years later, attracted much attention from the press but never much affected the way people voted.)\\"<br />OK. Father Greeley is a Roman Catholic priest and a sociologist - not a political scientist. I think he is way off base saying that people don't vote the right to choose issue. It is mirrored in our voting decisions from the President of the United States (who nominates United States Supreme Court Justices,) to United States Senators (who vote to confirm or reject those nominees - remember Clarence Thomas?) to our State Senators and Representatives. If Reed and his cronies get their President in, he will nominate Justices intent on overthrowing Roe v. Wade, and if the US Senate confirms those nominees - then there goes the U.S. Constitutional protection of a woman's right to choose (at least until the composition of The Court changes again.) It will then be up to each State to determine a woman's right to choose - so we consider that when voting at the State level, too.<br />I'm giving this book three stars - when it stays with the story of the O'Malley circle, it's a fun advancement of the epic.<br />reviewed (and editted - that's how I lost the hyperlink) by mbmlawn's right to choose (at least until the composition of The Court changes again.)

OK, this book is not Steinbeck and the Joads, but it's a \\"kick.\\"  It's September, 1957 and, with the assistance of *A Guide Book to Highway 66,* our hero and his \\"damsel in distress\\" are out to foil the bad guys and find hidden treasure. We follow Route 66 from Chicago's Lake Michigan  over 2,000 miles to (Pacific) Ocean Avenue in Los Angeles.  It was a fun and memory-laden trip for me.<br />Maybe the book will whet your appetite for touring on \\"Old\\" or \\"Historic\\" 66 instead of Interstate 55 or 40.  A lot of the old \\"Mother Road\\" is still there. So is Dixie Trucker's Home and other \\"attractions.\\"  Modern society has a  \\"need for speed,\\"  but sometimes it's nice to slow down and look around.<br />Along the way, the author makes poignant sociological and economic points: \\"... the aging two-lane bridge over the wash west of  Peerless (which the author notes is `the only truly `made up' locale in West on 66 ... and even it is a composite of the numerous bypassed and abandoned road communities that can be found along the western interstates.') was taken out by a flash flood.  This was bad enough, but then some bright young engineer in the State Highway Department noticed that if a replacement span and a bypass were built just a few miles downstream, a meandering northern loop could be cut out of Route 66.  The driving time from Winslow to Flagstaff could be reduced by a good fifteen minutes.  No doubt feeling proud of himself, he reached down and drew a little line on the map.  He couldn't have destroyed Peerless any more thoroughly if he'd called a bombing mission.  The traffic on the highway had become the lifeblood of the town.  Deprived of that bloodflow, gangrene set in rapidly.  No one came to eat Mary's hot beef sandwiches.  No one pawed through the beads and trinkets in the Tom Tom Trading Post. No one stayed at the Grand Canyon Auto Court even after they put in real air conditioning.\\"<br />And later on, towards the conclusion of this 1957 journey:<br /><br />\\"From Pasedena we took the Arroyo Seco Parkway downtown.  Lately, Ike's had a real bug in his ear about building a whole lot more of these freeways, as they're calling them.  They're planning on running them all over the country, and it's supposed to be quite a deal. I wonder.  I can't help thinking about Peerless and about all the other little towns strung out along old 66 and the other two-lanes.  What happens to them when the superslabs cut them off and their mother roads die?  If the Russians were to destroy a couple of hundred American communities, we'd call it an act of war.  If we do it to ourselves, we call it progress.\\"r />\\"From Pasedena we took the Arroyo Seco Parkway downtown.

Furthermore, this  captivatingly quirky novel is often laugh-out-loud funny - which may wake  up one's bed mate.<br />The characters and plotting are excellent: an  eclectic/mystical marvel that resonates Tom Robbin's *Another Roadside  Attraction.* In this first novel, Judge Clark also conveys useful insights,  including: &quot;You know, Miss Qwai, there are three red flags for a  lawyer.  The 1st comes when your client begins your initial meeting by  saying, &quot;My other lawyers told me, ...&quot; The 2nd comes when  there's a Camaro or a Rainbow vacuum cleaner involved in a divorce.

This reader will admit that I uttered an agonized moan upon the mention of  Cindasue  (see my previous review of _The Bishop and the Three Kings_) but,  \\"Hallelujah!\\" she never surfaces enough in this book to open her mouth  ;-)<br />I laughed out loud during an interchange between Bishop Blackie and  the former chairman of Bishop \\"Idiot's\\" parish council:  \\"He (Bishop  \\"Idiot\\") told us that we had no canonical powers and no right to meet  except at his request.

Slogging through the literal jungle, I found myself thinking of  other, more interesting things I could be doing: root canal, ingrown  toenail surgery - but pressing onward had its rewards.  The information  and plodding plot lines in the first half are, I suppose, necessary to set  up the thoroughly entertaining  noncoincidences in the second.<br />Robbins  still has his \\"festive manner of speaking\\" but Fierce Invalids lacks the  punchy panache of the previous publications.

Jessica Fletcher meets Ole, Lars, Sven and Lena.	\\"Try it, you'll like it!\\"<br />In the preliminary \\"unofficial guide\\" to &quot;the hotdish mystery,\\" the author explains to auslanders that hotdish is: (1) midwestern colloquialism for a hot entr&eacute;e that is similar to a  French casserole except that it is often inedible; (2) the [illegitimate -  sounds like \\"custard\\"] offspring of canned cream of mushroom soup.  (Actually - any creamed soup will do - cream of chicken, cream of celery -  etc.)  These quick, clever mysteries all involve - in varying manner - our  beloved,  ubiquitous hotdish. Also included are 18 delectable looking  hotdish recipes to make the Dr. Atkins carb police cry. The book  is a  celebration of the triumph over our legislature's misguided assault on  hotdish.  (Those silly people down in St. Paul tried to BAN HOTDISH at  communal gatherings - uttering some annihilistic balderdash about public  health concerns and the absence of USDA labeling.)

In many of his previous books and stories, SK has shown a flair and instinct for recreating the ambiance of \\"growing up\\" or coming of age in the `60's.  The difference here is that the \\"horror\\" at the centerpiece is  not some made-up monsters but the specter of the Viet Nam conflict.<br />These  are cleverly interwoven novellas which share \\"carry-over\\" characters. One  segment  metaphors the \\"60's generation\\" as citizens of the  since-sunken-and-gone-forever civilization of Atlantis. (These citizens  also become engrossed in the card game of Hearts - hence the unifying  title.)  There is a memory tweaking trip about the advent and proliferation  of the peace sign (sparrow track?)  Where were you when you first saw it?<br /> One of my favourite King-isms in another segment:  \\"Agent Orange - the  gift that keeps on giving.\\"  (talking about the high  incidence of lung  &amp; brain cancer, dental problems, etc.,  in Viet Nam veterans.)<br />In  the premier story in this book, King has a wise old character say that some  books have a great story and some books have great writing.  \\"read  sometimes for the story, Bobby.  Don't be like the book-snobs who won't do  that.  Read sometimes for the words - the language.  Don't be like the  play-it-safers that won't do  that. But when you find a book that has both  a good story and good words, treasure that book.\\"  Me thinkest that in this  compilation, King writes both good story and good words, and that he dost  sell himself short. It is a grand accomplishment.<br />I read the book last  winter and it \\"zinged\\" many dormant memories.  This summer, I listened to  the Unabridged audiocassette.  The bonus with the Audio version is that  both William Hurt (harking back to The Big Chill and some of my other  favourite quotes about the 60's) and the author himself give excellent  readings.  On audio, there is also a `free surprise bonus\\" at the end.	2000-06-29

Without revealing plot twists (I just hate it when people do that!) I will say that  it has similiarities to &quot;the Silence of the Lambs&quot; and John  Grisham's &quot;the Testament.&quot;<br />I read the first of the Lincoln  Rhyme books - &quot;the Bone Collector&quot; a while ago (and have not seen  the movie.) I have not read &quot;the Coffin Dancer&quot; (the 2nd of the  Lincoln Ryme novels) and therefore was somewhat disoriented. Unlike Diane  Mott Davidson's &quot;Goldie the caterer&quot; series, or Ed McBain's 87th  precinct series, Deaver does not re-introduce the main characters -  presuming the reader has read and retained prior character development. If  you have not read &quot;the Bone Collector&quot; and &quot;the Coffin  Dancer,&quot; I would suggest that you not &quot;jump in mid-stream.&quot;  You might enjoy this one more after following the advise of Glenda,  &quot;Good Witch&quot; of the North in the Land of OZ: &quot;It's always  best to start at the beginning&quot; and read these books in the order in  which they were written.	2000-06-22

I say \\"fooey\\" to the AMA and the government's USDA who persist in condemning Dr. Atkins.  (The AMA and the government's FDA are the same folks who told me phen/fen was  good for me.  HA!)  Dr. Atkins is a cardiologist and discovered this plan  30 years ago.  Dietary fat is not the same as, and does not equal, body  fat.  Contrary to the criticisms, this is NOT a NO carbs diet - one is  allowed up to 20 carbs per day in the initial 2 week \\"induction\\" phase of  this \\"way of eating.\\" (It's not a \\"flash in the pan\\" diet - it's a  life-long \\"way of eating.\\") Carbs can then gradually be adjusted upward.<br /><br />Don't do the \\"low carb thing\\" without first reading this book and  keeping it handy for reference.  I also suggest getting a carbohydrate  calorie counter reference - such as Allan Borushek's nifty little \\"The  Doctor's Pocket Calorie, Fat, And Carbohydrate Counter.\\"<br />/TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer<br />addendum:  For post-mortem vindication of Dr. Atkins and his vision, see  [[ASIN:1400040787 Good Calories, Bad Calories]]  Investigative Reporter Gary Taubes does an excellent and eye-opening job of exposing the Bad Science, poison politics, and silly sociology of American low-fat/high carb diet dogma.	2000-06-10

The subtitle of this book is \\"an Autobiography.\\"  Yet in the last pages, in the last sentence of the \\"Author's Note,\\" it says that \\"All interviews with Sammy Sosa were conducted in Spanish and translated into English.\\"  So  what we really have here is a book with the inherent pro-subject slant of  any AUTObiography coupled with the biases and outlook of the true author,  Marcos Bret`on. A lot of time is spent detailing the claimed biases against  what they (Sammy and/or the author) call \\"Latin players\\" by which they mean  any ball player coming from outside the USA (they include Puerto Ricans in  this group) who speaks Spanish as his first language.<br />Breton concludes  that: \\"Sosa became a living antidote to baseball's recent poisonous past,  in particular the 1994 baseball strike that canceled the World Series.  And  in the process, Sosa developed an appeal that extended beyond his sport.\\"  \\"Plainly stated, Sosa sells in Peoria, and everywhere else.\\"<br />This book  recounts a modern Horatio Alger tale:  Sammy's impoverished origins in the  Dominican Republic to the American icon he is today.  The chronological  narrative is carried along in many voices: Sammy/Breton, Sammy's friends,  mentors, relatives, and coaches.  Sammy and all his brothers and sisters  grew up in \\"a one-bedroom house with dirt floors and no indoor plumbing.\\" ...  and he would \\"practice on my street by hitting dried husks of maize again  and again.\\"  \\"So many Dominican prospects like Sammy are malnourished by  the time they reach their teens that they haven't developed  physically  yet.\\"<br />\\"Asked early in 2000 about his biggest regret, Texas Governor  and presidential hopeful George W. Bush - formerly managing partner of the  Texas Rangers - said \\"My biggest mistake was trading Sammy Sosa.\\"<br />The  book lets long-suffering Cub fans re-live that magical 1998 season after  Sammy first pays proper deference: \\"That spring of 1998 was a very sad time  for all Chicago.  Our community lost one of our favorites - my beloved  friend Harry Caray.  Harry helped me so much.  He was such a good person to  me. ... he was just one of those special people, and I know he is with God  now.  We all mourned his loss. And so before the start of the 1998 season,  I decided I would dedicate it to him.  Every time I hit a homer, I would be  hitting it for Harry - and for Mama, of course.\\"<br />The book concludes with  the for-the-Cubs-normal season of 1999.  After that, us \\"maybe next year\\"  Cub stalwarts can all give another listen to Steve Goodman's  wry anthem \\"A  Dying Cub Fan's Last Request.\\" [on the No Big Surprise CD.]ost one of our favorites - my beloved  friend Harry Caray.

It grew out of a commencement speech the author gave at Holy Cross  College.  Encouraged by audience members and her friend, Oprah Winfrey, she  has expanded it into book form.<br />Each chapter is arranged around a guiding  precept detailed by anecdotes in her interesting and inspirational life.  For instance: \\"Starting at the bottom builds character.  It makes you  hungry and determined.  It is also a good way to find out, stunning as it  may be, that you are not as smart as you think you are. \\"  She then goes on  to tell the reader about the bias against her when she started as an intern  in her first \\"real life\\" newsroom.  The news director thought she was a  \\"dilettante ... 21 year old graduate from a fancy college  - a RICH kid at  that- coming in there thinking ` Ooooh fun! Can I play with the cameras  too?  Hey, I wanna go  on the air!'\\" Maria showed him!  \\"There was nothing  I wouldn't do in that newsroom.  I worked my *** off.\\"  (Wow! I didn't know  the real Maria talked like that!) Now he's still in the small station  newsroom and she's where she is.<br />The book is composed,  not of  platitudes, but rather kernels of wisdom that need to be passed on through  the generations - especially today where \\"common sense\\" and \\"common  etiquette\\" are not common enough.<br />I would give \\"10 Things\\" a 10 - but we  are only allowed 5 stars.	2000-05-25

Maybe because it is encouraging when the forces of law &amp; order \\"get their man [or woman]\\" and partly to ponder how a human psyche could go so wrong.  I bought this book a long  time ago, but put off reading it because there are no photographs.  To this  avid reader of the \\"True Crime\\" genre, photographs are very important. What  does the defendant look like?  What was the setting?  Showing  me the major  participants makes the story more \\"real.\\" This is the story of \\"Mysterious  George\\" Russell, childhood \\"mascot\\" of the Mercer Island, Washington,  P.D.  Why was he so \\"charming\\" to his friends and victims?  I don't know and the  author/publisher chose not to tell us or show us. And Washington, again?  What is it with the Pacific Northwest? A spawning ground for salmon, serial  murderers (Ted Bundy, Green River et. al.)and chroniclers of serial  murderers?<br />I am more impressed with \\"the other Olson\\" True Crime writer  [see my review of Greg Olson's _Starvation Heights_ - 5 stars - about  another murderer in the Seattle area] and the \\"Queen\\" of True Crime - Ann  Rule - who has recently ventured out of the Pacific Northwest for her  excellent _And Never Let Her Go_ [murder in Delaware] - also 5 stars.	2000-05-23

There are many photos in this updated version of Stephen Williams' excellent true crime book.  The photos, showing the ostensibly &quot;charming couple,&quot; illustrate how deceiving &quot;looks&quot; can  be. This is an engrossing but stomache-churning account of the Canadian  gruesome duo - with abundant detail. Details such as: Karla's favourite  book was American Psycho. But in Mr. Williams' book, one also learns that,  although more publicized, the United States of America isn't the only  country with psychos!	2000-05-15

It is more an erudite treatise than a popular cultural commentary.  It is an arcane essay on anthropological, sociological, and philosophical aspects of  food &amp; food choices. The author says in the Introduction that \\"For many  years, I've been a Zen Buddhist, and in many ways this is a matter of going  against the tide of larger cultural forces around me.\\" The viewpoint  flavors this endeavour.

The drawback with biographies of  favourite people is that the reader knows how it all ends before beginning.  So I approached this book with trepidation - preparing to be depressed.  I was not disappointed.<br />For  Judy, there were glorious highs - and lows that would have decimated most  people although Judy &quot;recovered&quot; from all but the last. This book  is an amalgam of previously published resources and new information  including the author's interviews and Judy's own autobiographical musing  and ranting  into a tape recorder for a book that never was. The book is  sometimes disconcerting as it jumps back and forth through the years,  sometimes pedantic, and told this reader more that I wanted to know about  Judy's sex life.  (I hope I can forget the one encounter involving the song  or my enjoyment of her singing \\"Over the Rainbow\\" will be forever  diminished.)  As the author says: \\"More than any other stimulus, [music]  awakens sleeping memories.\\"<br />The author, while casting aspersions on  Judy's mother and Louis B. Meyer &amp; the MGM system for starting Judy on  pills and yo-yo dieting , himself seems fixated with Judy's constantly  fluctuating weight.  There is a picture on page 346 of a bloatedly ill Judy  that one would think would do more to motivate dieters and fitness wannabes  more than any exhortations by Richard  Simmons or Sarah Fergason.  Just put  a copy of that picture on your freezer door - you won't want to reach in to  grab Haagen-Daz!<br />When Judy was \\"on\\" she was brilliant.  The author points  out that for most of her life \\"In those days, there were no drugs to fight  depression - the first antidepressant, Iproniazid, did not come on to the  market until 1957.\\"  Later in the book, he speculates that Judy was  \\"probably bi-polar.\\"  How different could it have been if only ...	2000-05-11

The pictures are nice, but this reviewer finds the research somewhat slap-dash.<br />There are no cited sources for many of the passages, including the description of JFK's skull at the time of the Presidential limo's arrival at Dallas Parkland Memorial Hospital. A researcher would do better to consider Mark Lane's _A Citizen's Dissent_, Jim Garrison's _On the Trail of the Assassins_, and Jim Marrs' _Crossfire: the Plot that Killed Kennedy_ or many other serious studies.<br />This book also glosses over Ethel's family of origin - the Skakels -[See Mark Fuhrman's _Murder in Greenwich : Who Killed Martha Moxley?_]<br />Another error, this one exhibitting a lack of geographical care or concern by the author and his editors: on page 131 of the hardcover edition, it says that that Jackie's Secret Service agent, Clint Hill, was &quot;a former football star at Concordia College in North Dakota.&quot; Concordia College is in Moorhead, MINNESOTA (Moorhead being the 2nd half of the &quot;other&quot; Twin Cities: Fargo/Moorhead.) The Red River of the North splits the two cities - and states: Fargo, North Dakota and Moorhead, Minnesota.<br />Because I realized early in these 513 pages that the book did not comport with other verifiable sources, I read it with skepticism and, as such, it was interesting in a Danielle Steel sort of way.	2000-05-10
