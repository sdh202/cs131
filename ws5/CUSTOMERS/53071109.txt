I'm sure I'm taken in by much of it as well, but even I can't be fooled all the time.<br /><br />Still, the answer is not to simply give up.  On a few topics, I actually am well enough informed so that (while I still may be susceptible to propaganda myself) I can recognize the symptoms of others falling for it.  And this is definitely a phenomenon one ought to look for in others if one wants to cure oneself!  I do think we ought to try to become so informed about at least a few topics that we can recognize nonsense.  On these topics, we ought to listen, but we also ought to be unafraid to state facts and make judgments.  On other topics, we ought to be much more careful.<br /><br />Perhaps the most dramatic examples for me have been some truly amazing statements about the Arab war on Israel made by some rather well-educated and generally skeptical people.  It makes me wonder why those who are ready to challenge all sorts of claims in so many other areas accept some extremely dubious, afactual, and illogical nonsense about this topic without question, and repeat it to me.  Are they unaware that they are making statements that may well be false?  Are they unable to discuss this issue without making very controversial comments as if they were not only accepted and indisputable facts, but relevant facts as well?<br /><br />On one occasion, when I suggested to a colleague that I happened to know quite a bit about the Arab war against Israel, hoping to politely give him a way to defer to me, temporarily, on a couple of facts, I merely got an outraged reply.  Was I not aware that my colleague was a highly intelligent and well-informed person?  What made me think that I knew something he didn't?  I was more than a little surprised by such a reaction: normally if a person claims to know something better than we do, we listen, even if we disagree.<br /><br />This book, written over four decades ago, helps explain a little of what is going on.  It shows how intellectuals can be so horribly susceptible to propaganda.  As both the book and Konrad Kellen's preface to it state, intellectuals absorb a great deal of second-hand and unverifiable information.  They often feel a need to have an opinion about such information.  In addition, they consider themselves so smart that they can \\"judge for themselves.\\"  And they seriously underestimate their susceptibility to propaganda given that they can see mere idiots reject some of it with ease.<br /><br />The truth, as Ellul explains, is that high intelligence, a broad culture, constant use of critical faculties, and access to and use of sources of information are indeed the best weapons against propaganda.  They simply aren't used often enough.<br /><br />Ellul shows how propaganda can have a powerful effect if one is saturated with it.  It is useful, he explains, to have someone from one's own frame of reference come up with it.  The German National Socialists were careful to put Englishmen on their radio.  Anti-Zionists, by the way, are very proud to have Jews state their case, although we should all know that there is no objective reason to trust every Jew, any more than there is to trust every person.<br /><br />We readers see how propaganda is most useful when it reinforces earlier biases and misconceptions.  And how it becomes extremely powerful once a person makes an active commitment to a cause: that person finds it very tough to recant.<br /><br />The book also shows how propaganda gets one to come up with strange ideas about what is relevant material to support one's arguments.  That has the effect of precluding dialog with those who disagree with you.  That's why my colleague \\"knew\\" better than to take anything I said seriously or reply to it coherently.  And it is why careful and cautious statements on my part sounded not merely like admissions that truth was fiction, and vice-versa, but evidence that I was hopelessly biased, impervious to reason, and hooked on rather wild propaganda myself.<br /><br />This book is fascinating.  It made me realize that propaganda is indeed more effective than most of us might realize.  And that it is dangerous.  Ellul implies that propaganda may well be the most serious threat we humans face.  And I think we ought to treat it as such.that truth was fiction, and vice-versa, but evidence that I was hopelessly biased, impervious to reason, and hooked on rather wild propaganda myself.   <br /> <br />This book is fascinating.

And I support human rights for everyone.  But I know that it is not always easy for those whose rights are violated to get a hearing.  The powers that be may not be interesting in publicizing their complaints.  What is to be done?<br /><br />The answer is to find a way to speak out, and to get allies.  And this book could be part of such an effort.  Instead, it achieves the opposite effect.  The wrong allies have been chosen.  It is bad enough to choose tyrants as allies.  It is catastrophic to choose liars.<br /><br />It is a good idea to monitor our behavior.  But that requires honesty and accuracy, not mere transmission of anti-American propaganda.<br /><br />Since this book mentions American involvement in the Middle East, it would have been a good idea for it to find fault with our government's tolerance for and even support of opponents of human rights, including Arafat and his gang.  However, this book chooses to ignore Arafat's transgressions and find fault with Arafat's Israeli victims for building a separation fence to defend the lives of Israeli citizens!  And the book finds fault with the United States for supporting Israel's right to do this at the International Court of Justice.<br /><br />A book about human rights that includes such a gross moral error simply can't be trusted.  And those who wish to use such a book to air their grievances about transgressions of human rights thus lose an opportunity to be heard and taken seriously.	2005-10-09
10041:US	53071109	R143L8NQP2ZHQA	1888710225	361634645	The Essential Center Counter: A Practical Guide for Black	Books	5	17	18	N	N	A good chess repertoire book	The Center Counter (although I call it the Scandinavian) is one of my two defences to 1 e4 (my other is the Berlin Defence to the Ruy Lopez).  And so I am glad to have a copy of Andrew Martin's recommendation for how to play this defence with Black.  I like Martin's writing style, and I very much enjoyed an earlier book of his, Secret Weapons, which I read fourteen years ago.  In that book, Martin taught me plenty about the Icelandic Gambit, which is reached after 1 e4 d5 2 exd5 Nf6 3 c4 e6.  After 4 dxe6 Bxe6 5 d4? (5 Nf3 is correct, after which Martin, quite reasonably in my opinion, advised 5...c5) 5...Bb4+, Black was already better.<br /><br />In this book, Martin recommends 2...Qxd5 rather than 2...Nf6, and I think this is reasonable.  There are no flaky sidelines here.  After 3 Nc3, we do not see 3...Qd8 or 3...Qd6.  Instead, he recommends the main line: 3...Qa5 4 d4 c6 5 Nf3 Nf6 6 Bc4 Bf5.  He spends four chapters on this, and I agree that Black looks okay here.<br /><br />In another chapter (I'm working backwards through his book), Martin tells us about alternate sixth moves for White, such as 6 Ne5, 6 Bd2, and 6 Bd3.  I think some care is needed in answering 6 Bd2, which is recommended by John Emms.  Martin wants us to try 6...Qb6 7 Bc4 Bf5 here, but Emms plays 8 Qe2, and that leaves us readers with some work to do.<br /><br />In the previous chapter, we see White play Bc4 earlier.  The author warns us that 4 Bc4 Nf6 5 d3 c6 6 Bd2 is one of the most dangerous lines for White.  He says that 6...Qc7 is wisest here (that's probably true).  And he gives some good analysis.  But as Jovanka Houska has shown in a couple of recent games, White can try 7 Qe2 Bf5 (if 7...g6 8 Nf3) 8 h6 (threatening a King-side pawn storm).  Once again, we readers are left with some work to do.  And that's fair.  There are plenty of ideas against the Center Counter, and it is up to us to be prepared for the most recent ones (especially ideas like these, which got tried after this book came out).<br /><br />We also see some other fourth moves by White, including 4 Nf3, 4 g3, and the infamous Mieses Gambit, 4 b4.  Martin explains that after 4 b4 Qxb4 5 Rb1 Qd6 6 Nf3 Nf6 7 d4, Black ought not play a passive move like 7...c6, but either 7...e6 or 7...a6 (with the idea of choosing between ...e6 and ...g6 next).  And he gives an Awful example of what can happen to Black if he stays too passive.<br /><br />The author warns us that White can try 3 Nf3, which is somewhat tricky as well.  He advises us to play 3...Nf6 4 d4 Bg4 5 Be2 e6.  But I do not like this for Black.  In fact, we've transposed into a Portuguese Variation here, which generally arises from the 2...Nf6 Center Counter (1 e4 d5 2 exd5 Nf6 3 d4 Bg4 4 Nf3 Qxd5 5 Be2 e6).  I think that once again, we readers have some work to do after 6 h3.<br /><br />The part of the book that I like best is the opening section, where we see how to defend against four unusual second moves for White, 2 Nf3, 2 e5, 2 Nc3, and 2 d4.<br /><br />2 Nf3 is the Tennison Gambit, and is something like a reversed Budapest Defence.  White has to struggle to equalize (but that's okay in some club level games).  After 2...dxe4 3 Ng5 (even 3 Ne5 may be playable here) 3...Bf5 4 Nc3 Nf6, White can play 5 Qe2 Nc6 (after which White can try 6 Qb5 or 6 Ngxe4).  But that makes no sense to me.  The whole idea for White is to continue in what Martin calls \\"rubbishy\\" style with 5 Bc4 e6 6 f3.  I'd be leery of playing 6...exf3 here, and so is Martin, who recommends 6...Bc5 and shows how this gets White in trouble.  If I were White, I would continue with 7 Ngxe4 Nxe4 8 Bb5+ c6 9 fxe4, but obviously Black stands better.<br /><br />2 Nc3 is the Dunst Opening, and that's certainly playable for White.  Martin gives us 2...dxe4 3 Nxe4 Bf5 (this sure looks good to me).  At this point, White can play 4...Ng3, but Martin explains that this isn't really a Caro-Kann.  Black may wind up saving a tempo by playing c5 directly at some point.  So White tends to try 4 Qf3 Bg6, and Martin shows some analysis of this, including the interesting 5 h4.<br /><br />2 d4 is the infamous and dubious Blackmar Gambit.  After 2...dxe4 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 f3 exf3, White can play 5 Nxf3 c6 6 Bc4 Bg4 7 0-0 e6, after which Black is clearly better.  Or White can try giving away a second pawn with 5 Qxf3 Qxd4 6 Be3  (hoping for something like 6...Qb4 7 0-0-0 Bg4? 8 Nb5 with a big advantage) 6...Qg4! 7 Qf2 e5.<br /><br />The Scandinavian is indeed playable.  By the way, it has been a favorite of some very strong Women chess players.  And I recommend this book.at some point.

That includes rights to life, liberty, property, and, of course, immigration to Israel as a place of refuge.  The \\"post-Zionists\\" claim that this function of Israel is no longer necessary.  That would be a dubious claim in peacetime.  It is absurd in wartime.  That means that the \\"post-Zionists\\" are wrong, and that are failing to defend human rights.<br /><br />Shlomo Sharan begins this book by explaining that in every generation, some Jews sought freedom from Exile, and that the flow of Jews into the Levant never completely ceased.  And that the Arab armies have far more soldiers than does Israel's army.  And that the idea that peace can be achieved, rather than precluded, by setting up a new Arab country next to Israel, although promoted by Europe and America, is an illusion.<br /><br />Following Sharan's introduction are twelve articles that comprise the rest of the book.<br /><br />Yoav Gelber's article shows that the goal of the Levantine Arabs has been neither coexistence nor compromise.<br /><br />Sharan follows with an article about Myth.  He points out that post-Zionist publications are aimed at vilifying Zionism, not at telling the truth.  And he wonders why the statement that the Arab armies have a numerical superiority over Israel's army is called a \\"myth\\" (with the implication of being a falsehood) when it is actually a fact.  He says that \\"the ingathering of exiles\\" (another fact) is not included in the list of Zionist \\"myths.\\"  I suspect it will be, though!  And he says that the deconstructionist approach to history is extremely nihilistic.<br /><br />Now, is post-Zionism antisemitic?  Sharan says it is.  After all, the salient characteristics of antisemitism are:<br /><br />1)  Fabrication (false accusations, such as blood libel)<br /><br />2)  Generalization (holding all Jews responsible for an act of an individual)<br /><br />3)  Judaization (asserting that only Jews commit a set of crimes that are regularly committed by people in all societies)<br /><br />4)  Discriminatory harshness (if Gentiles do it, it's cool, if Jews do it, it's tacky)<br /><br />Post-Zionism certainly meets the first, third, and fourth of these characteristics.<br /><br />Edward Alexander's fine article discusses politics and Israeli intellectuals.  One book he discusses is David Grossman's \\"The Yellow Wind,\\" which he points out has occasional patches of honesty.  But he explains that Grossman is more upset by the potential of Jewish terrorism than the reality of Arab terrorism.<br /><br />Hanan Alexander shows the danger of dismissing Jewish rights on the grounds that Israel is \\"hegemonic\\" and the Arabs are \\"oppressed.\\"  Any crimes could be justified by such an argument, and acceptance of this would preclude the rule of law.<br /><br />David Bukay tries to explain the identification of many Jews with their mortal enemies.  He says it is part of the heritage of Exile, where there was a desire to flatter and tattle to win approval from Gentiles.  And he points out that this runs counter to the behavior of most of the people in other nations.<br /><br />Raya Epstein shows the religious nature of anti-Zionism, which is basically a \\"new world church\\" that pits an alliance of Europe and the Muslim world against the right of Israel (and of Jews) to exist.  And John Fonte has a fine article about the powerful antidemocratic forces that remain in Western society.<br /><br />Norman Doidge shows the seriousness of the failure to bring Arafat to justice for his horrendous crimes.  This has had the effect of implying that some of his crimes may be justified.<br /><br />Arieh Stav discusses Jewish self-hatred.  And he explains that Israel's status in the UN ought not be overlooked.  In 1997, 131 states, representing 95% of the people in the world, denounced Israel \\"for daring to prepare land for housing construction within the municipal boundaries of its capital.\\"<br /><br />Articles by Yosef Oren, Hillel Weiss, and Shlomo Sharan conclude this interesting book.

Actually, Pinski shows that 4...Bd6 is also quite playable here.  One of the more unusual variations he gives here is 4...Bd6 5 g4 Bc5 6 g5, but I'd certainly much rather have Black in this position.<br /><br />Of course, this book will also help you play the Four Knights with White.  And that can come in handy, even if you play the Ruy.  When I was a beginner, decades ago, I decided to play the Exchange Ruy with White.  But the first time I tried it, it went like this:<br /><br />1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nf6.  I did not want to play against the Petroff Defence, so I decided to play something I knew (since I defended against 1 e4 with 1...e5), namely the main line of the Scotch Four Knights!  3 Nc3 Nc6 4 d4 exd4 5 Nxd4 Bc5 (oops, my opponent chose a rare sideline) 6 Nxc6 bxc6 7 Bd3 d6 8 0-0 and I had at least an equal game, and maybe a slight edge.  In any case, I was never in trouble and eventually won.  To my surprise, as this book relates, this exact position was reached many years later in the game Miles versus Hebden.<br /><br />In my next attempt to play the Exchange Ruy, the game went:<br /><br />1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 Nf6. (Oh, no!  That's my beloved Berlin Defence!  I decided to avoid it with White, and try the Spanish Four Knights instead.) 4 Nc3 Bb4 5 0-0 0-0.

It deals with journalistic sensationalism and lack of ethics.  I am not surprised that Israel is not faring well in this war.  The other side is cheating.  And the referees aren't taking them to task for it.  Still, Israel has no choice but to maintain its standards and value truth.  Meanwhile, I think that many Arabs have drifted into a culture of destruction in this war.  And maybe this culture is reflected to some extent in the media war.  As Stephanie Gutmann shows, the anti-Zionists are making a mockery of journalistic standards.  They are destroyers, not creators.  In the short term, they may appear to be winning, but they are not achieving anything positive.<br /><br />Like many other people, including myself, Gutmann was surprised at the extent to which many people \\"were ready to drop the skepticism they showed in most other areas of their lives and believe everything the New York Times and CNN told them about the conflict and then develop such great passions about a relatively small affair, in a land very far away.\\"  Many people are doubtful that Israel even wants peace, even though almost all humans, including Israelis, would rather be rich, free, and alive than poor, enslaved, and dead.<br /><br />The author tells about the Mohammed al-Dura case in some detail.  This was a 12-year old who probably died  in  September, 2000, during the Arab aggression against Israel.  If he died, he was probably killed (intentionally or unintentionally) by Arabs.  But there isn't enough evidence to tell for certain what happened.  Still, the case points out the huge number of staged events (look at the cover of the book for a typical example) and the amount of media misinformation.  As Gutmann says, \\"there is one clear bad guy in `al-Dura' and that is the international media.\\"<br /><br />In another chapter, the author tells us of another case of journalistic malpractice, exposed by the apologies by Italian TV to Arab thugs for filming the some of the lynching of two Israeli soldiers.<br /><br />Gutmann confirms that Israel is treated as a Very Important nation.  And a Dangerous one.  She says that the coverage of the war against it sometimes seems to be only of Israel, as if the Arabs were some sort of undefined \\"amoebic force.\\"  And she tells of the American Colony Hotel, which is a sort of propaganda headquarters for what I consider the War Against Human Rights.  In this war, the media have, as the author points out, gone from being observers to participants.  And I think the majority of them are fighting against human rights.<br /><br />There is a fine chapter on the ghastly misreporting of the Jenin battle of April, 2002.  And there is a discussion of the reaction to the confinement of Arafat to Ramallah.  By the way, in my opinion, the failure of the international community to bring a thug like Arafat to justice is a great crime against humanity.  But the adoration of Arafat that the media showed is even more sickening and surreal.  Gutmann considers Arafat to have been \\"a masterful media manipulator.\\"  I very strongly disagree, and I find it hard to imagine what the world would be like if Arafat had possessed even average, let alone above average talent in this or in any other regard.<br /><br />One dramatic example of venomous journalistic malpractice that I won't forget is of the reaction to an inciteful sermon given by an Arab sheik in Gaza.  Almost every sentence of the speech was out of line.  The author tells us parts of it, where the sheik calls the Jews terrorists, butchers of Arab children, and desecrators of holy places who must be butchered and killed.  And where he tells his listeners to \\"have no mercy on the Jews, no matter where they are, in any country,\\" and to fight and \\"kill those Jews and those Americans who are like them.\\"  But how did William Orme of the New York Times report this?  He looked through the sermon for just one tame line that he could quote out of context.  And he found one!  It was, \\"whether Likud or Labor, Jews are Jews.\\"  That is the only line he permitted his readers to see from the sermon!  I consider such a vicious misrepresentation of Israeli concerns about incitement to be a serious attack on journalistic standards, truth, and human rights.  Gutmann needs to be praised for pointing it out to us.<br /><br />Gutmann quotes an Arab who explains that the Oslo agreement of 1993 was merely a contract between Arafat (and ten thousand or so of his supporters) and Israel.  I agree.  And it does seem to me as stupid as not realizing the difference between America's people (represented by our government) and the Mafia, and making a deal with the wrong one.<br /><br />Gutmann tells of the bad guys, such as the infamous Peter Jennings of ABC News, Suzanne Goldenberg of the Guardian, Lee Hockstader of the Washington Post, and Gillian Findlay of ABC News.  And she also tells us of the good guys.  I'm not surprised that there are people who do fight back to support truth and standards.

On the topic of Arab aggression against Israel, Vidal says that in America, \\"Arabs are characterized as sub-human terrorists.  Israel may not be criticized at all.\\"  That's not true.  And he says that the Israeli lobby has \\"extorted\\" more money from the U. S. treasury for its holy land than any other minority.

And this book does not make oppression of Jews a good, moral, or productive idea either.<br /><br />The first chapter rips into the Old Testament.  That's fine with me.  After all, I'm a Pagan and I dislike monotheism.  But the author somehow concludes from the fact that the Bible has plenty of things wrong with it that the Jews ought not have human rights.  And he implies that in addition, Jews should not be allowed to want to live in their ancient homeland.  I think that's preposterous.  I think People, including Jews, will always want to live somewhere.  And some will want to live in their homelands.  To deny them the right to want to do so is totally crazy.  Even denying them the right to do it is, in my opinion, out of line.<br /><br />In the second chapter, Rose takes issue with the idea of Jewish exile.  Once again, that's absurd.  Jews always knew about Jerusalem and Zion, and they knew that relatively few Jews lived there after the defeat of Bar Kochba in 135 AD.  They also knew that Jews did not have political control there.<br /><br />In the next chapter, the author mocks the idea of Jewish suffering during the Exile.  Perhaps he ought to make fun of Black slavery as well.  After all, he could say that Blacks, for the most part, did okay under slavery.  They were bought and sold.  They were worth something to their owners, so most of them were treated acceptably, at least according to the standards of the owners!  And the same can be said for how Jews were treated in many lands.  Jews often did considerably better than Pagans, by the way.<br /><br />Still, what is the point of all this by the author?  It seems that he's grasping at straws, trying to justify oppression of Jews and denial of human rights to them.<br /><br />Even the examples Rose uses are dubious.  He mentions Shakespeare's Shylock.  But it is highly unlikely that much of Shakespeare's audience sympathized at all with the incidental lines Shakespeare gave him.  If one reads the entire play, it appears that Shylock is treated neither sympathetically nor ambiguously.  And even had Rose found a decent example, that still would not have helped to prove his case.<br /><br />After this, Rose complains that Zionism put Jews at odds with Arabs.  Well, emancipation of Black slaves put them at odds with the Ku Klux Klan.  What is his point?<br /><br />What about the land the modern Zionists started to buy up?  Yes, in the Levant.  Well, they moved a little to the West of the traditional Jewish region.  Tel Aviv and the other coastal cities were a big focus, not the now Arab towns of Nablus and Hebron, or even Bethlehem.  But Rose insults us all by making it appear that the Levant was already occupied by some mythical Sacred and Racist People.  And that the Jews really needed to flee to someplace in the West where they would face assimilation as well as yet again be living outside their homeland, a homeland they still would have no control over any part of.<br /><br />The Levant was not occupied by a Sacred and Racist People.  There were some non-Jewish people there a century ago, just as there were and are Russians in the Baltic nations, or Mongols in Russia.  Jews did no wrongs to people by buying land in places they wanted to live in and improve.  Rose taunts the Jews by saying that Israel is a dangerous place for them to live.  Well, in the 1940s, there were more dangerous places!  Israel has been an important element in the defense of Jewish rights.  Had Israel come into existence in 1938, rather than 1948, it is probable that hundreds of thousands or more lives, both Jewish and non-Jewish would have been saved.  But Rose conveniently forgets this.<br /><br />The author comes up with a misleading history of the British Mandate, as though the British and Jews were partners in crime.  The truth is that the Jews eventually had to fight for their lives and freedom against the British, and that the British White Paper of 1939 effectively condemned a huge number of Jews to death.<br /><br />Rose also discusses whether the Holocaust supplies moral justification for Zionism.  That is, once again, a stupid question.  It is like asking whether the U. S. Civil War provides justification for the emancipation of American Blacks.  Emancipation of Blacks and Jews is simply an issue of human rights.  It needs no excuse.<br /><br />The author concludes with an appeal to end the Law of Return, thereby taking away the main duty of Israel, which is to give refuge to Jews.  And it makes me wonder when we'll see similar appeals to reinstitute Black slavery, all in the name of peace and justice.<br /><br />This book makes me wonder about the etiology of anti-Zionist lies.  And about the signficance of the use of such lies by various media organizations, academic departments, and a variety of international organizations, as well as in books such as this one.  The issue is not the politics.  Nor is it a serious discussion of the accuracy of the charges made against those who support human rights.

Harold and Hannah Margolis are from Los Angeles, and when they first went to Israel in 2000, there was plenty of hope for a peace agreement with the Arabs.  The book begins with a description of their visits to Jerusalem, Ashkelon, Eilat, En Gedi, Hebron, Haifa, and Gamla.  And they mention in the section about Hebron that those who call Israel's existence an \\"occupation\\" generally mean only that the administration is not Islamic.<br /><br />The return trip to Israel, in 2001, turned out to be a little different.  This was an Israel bonds tour, so they got to meet with several Israeli dignitaries.  And they planned to serve as volunteers on an archeological dig site.  By this time, they were quite interested in discovering the history of Jewish presence in the Levant.  And this book describes some of their conclusions.  Obviously, there was a Jewish presence in the Levant ever since Jews first lived there, millennia ago.  In some places, such as Pek'in, Jews were present continuously from Second Temple times to the advent of modern Zionism.<br /><br />The book concludes with a section about the Arab anti-Israeli violence.  What motivates the perpetrators?  The author comes up with several precepts that he feels are responsible.  These include ideas from the Qur'an, among them that of Jewish dhimmihood, a reaction to having been occupied by European and other powers, whose home bases were far away from the Levant, sympathy for and support for the losing sides of both World Wars I and II, arbitrary but constant insistence on the illegality of a Jewish state, and subscription to a myth of having founded and owned the land in the past.<br /><br />I recommend this book.	2005-09-30

Flannery teaches us quite a bit about the ecological history of Australasia for the past few tens of thousands of years.  We learn about the flora and fauna, and about the impact of the people who rely on the fertility of the land to survive.  We see examples of how human populations fared in places such as Tasmania and Easter Island, where they became isolated and started to run out of resources.<br /><br />It is not surprising that some populations have increased until they affected the viability of the ecosystems.  But we also see that many populations have not simply grown until there was a catastrophic shortage of resources, followed by a nearly complete population collapse.  And we see that even moderate populations can collapse catastrophically.<br /><br />One famous example of the collapse of a moderate population comes not from Australasia, but from England.  The population nearly vanished there in the sixth century AD.  Flannery cites one of the very few relics from the centuries immediately following this disaster, a poem fragment called \\"The Ruin.\\"  The author quotes from this poem, and quite properly shows that the author could not imagine how the people of only a few centuries earlier could have built what had clearly been an imposing structure.  Of course, such structures were in fact built in Roman times.  When the Romans left, the population went down considerably in the chaos that followed.  And after that, one or more plagues almost totally depopulated England (by the way, although Flannery does not mention it, the author of the Ruin seems to have been aware of this latter fact).<br /><br />Well, what does Flannery think a good population for Australia ought to be?  He cites various sources that feel a maximum population for the country ought to be anywhere from 10 million to about 480 million.  The present population of Australia is about 20 million, and the author is concerned about the potential inability of Australia to support such a population indefinitely, especially were the place isolated.<br /><br />I agree that Flannery's concern is legitimate.  In addition, I think we humans now have the ability to increase the population of Australia to far more than the land could hold after some major mishap.  After all, plenty of sunlight falls on Australia.  We're capable of using that sunlight for power.  And we can use that power to desalinate water and pump it all over the place.  That could result in fundamental changes to the ecosystem.  In my opinion, these technological advances might easily allow a population of 500 million or more in Australia.  And that population would remain stable until something went wrong.  I think it's a scenario worth considering.<br /><br />I recommend this book.support such a population indefinitely, especially were the place isolated.

The book is up-to-date, with plenty of annotated recent games as examples.<br /><br />The book covers the lines resulting from 1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6.  Quite often, White continues with 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 Nc3.  And, in this introductory book, Flear explains how to play either side of the major lines which follow:<br /><br />4...dxc4 is the Slav.<br />4...e6 is the Semi-Slav<br />4...a6 is the Chameleon, a waiting move that is considered part of the Slav<br /><br />In some cases, White plays 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 e3.  Black can now reply 4...g6, the Schlechter, which the author also has a chapter on.<br /><br />But there is a line which I think is a nuisance for Black.  White can simply play 3 cxd5, the Exchange Variation.  Black has to recapture, and the game becomes relatively easy for White.  As the book shows, Black is not in serious trouble in this line, but I certainly would rather have White.<br /><br />There is a way, however, to pretty much avoid the Exchange Variation.  As Flear shows, Black can play the Triangle.  That's the move order I recommend.  Black plays 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6.  After 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 Nc3 c6, Black is playing a Semi-Slav and has avoided the Exchange Variation.  White can still take the pawn on move 3, but it isn't as good a line.<br /><br />Most likely, White will play 3 Nc3.  Now, Black plays 3...c6, blocking her Queen Bishop even more.  This is the characteristic position of the Triangle.  White's main choices are:<br /><br />4 e3, after which Black has a choice: play 4...Nf6 and get to a Semi-Slav in which White's most dangerous move, Bg5, has been avoided.  Or play 4...f5, transposing to a very playable version of the Dutch Stonewall (although White can still play 5 g4).<br /><br />4 Nf3, after which Black can play 4...Nf6 and get into a Semi-Slav in which White does indeed have the option of playing 5 Bg5.  Or play dxc4, the Noteboom, which is wild but okay for Black.<br /><br />4 e4, the dangerous Marshall Gambit.  This typically goes: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 c6 4 e4 dxe4 5 Nxe4 Bb4 6 Bd2 Qxd4 7 Bxb4 Qxe4+ 8 Be2.  White's idea is to allow 8...Qxg2, answering with 9 Qd6 Nd7 10 0-0-0 and an extremely dangerous attack.  So Black tends to play 8...Na6.  If you are going to play this line in tournaments, I think you'll need to study more than just this introductory book, however.<br /><br />Of course, that is not all Black has to learn.  As I said, there is that variation where White plays 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nf3 Nf6 (you do not want to play 3...c6 here, after which White has too many good options) 4 Nc3 e6.  This is the Semi-Slav, which the book spends over 100 pages on.  White generally plays:<br /><br />5 Bg5.  This gives Black the choice of playing what Flear recommends, 5...dxc4 (the Botvinnik variation).  Or trying the move I use, 5...h6 (the Moscow variation).  Both require some work to learn, and Flear teaches us quite a bit about both moves.<br /><br />5 e3, which leads either to the Meran variation or some Meran-avoiding sideline.  The Meran variation the book recommends for Black is 5 e3 Nbd7 6 Bd3 dxc4 7 Bxc4 b5 8 Bd3 Bb7, a popular line which I've used for many years.<br /><br />This book is useful and easy to read.

Golly, it is frustrating to be poor.  And it certainly degrades the quality of one's life. I sure wouldn't blame someone for wanting to be richer.  And it is frustrating not to be at peace.  That also degrades the quality of one's life.  And I certainly applaud Jennifer Miller for wanting peace, and for being impatient about it.  Nobody wants to live in a war-torn region.<br /><br />Yes, Miller wants peace.  That's good.  But I feel she is not making any progress towards achieving it.  She discusses some of the problems with the education of Arab schoolchildren, which I feel is a major reason why peace is so tough to attain right now.  But she is simply too timid to fight back against these problems.  For her to do so, she would have to risk breaking the ties she has made to various Arabs.  It isn't easy to do that.<br /><br />The author acknowledges the fact that there are quite a few anti-Zionist lies in print.  But what ought to be done about them?<br /><br />I'll tell you my answer to that one.  No matter what is done, if the lies stay, there will not be peace.  Arab leaders will have to stop engaging in such stuff, win or lose, if they want peace.<br /><br />Peace is such a benefit that I feel it makes little sense to describe the prerequisite for it as painful concessions.  It would not be a painful concession to stop hitting one's head against a wall.  Nor would it be a painful concession for both sides to abide human rights for everyone.  But I do think that prerequisites for peace include sincerity, truth, and justice. And I think that Miller simply can't figure out how to ask for such things, let alone get them.<br /><br />Miller makes it appear that Israel is important, and that by changing its ways, it can make peace far more likely.  I disagree.  Israel is a small nation which has been depicted as very important by the international community.  But it is still just Israel, a nation of a few million people and of about 10,000 square miles (the Arabs have 5,500,000 square miles).  Israel can indeed change some of its behavior.  But its behavior hasn't been the cause of the Arab war against it, so I very much doubt that anything Israel could do will bring about peace.  I even doubt that dissolving Israel would bring about peace, given that the causes of the strife would still be there.<br /><br />Of course, Israelis can be accused of being paranoid, and of being unfairly afraid that if they lose a war, the Arabs will slaughter them.  But I think that this accusation is false.  We saw Israelis agree to try Oslo, and Camp David.  And even if the Israelis were afraid of what could happen to them were they overrun, that would in no way make it wrong for them to defend themselves against aggression and terror.<br /><br />I think that there is always a reasonable argument for staying out of foreign wars, or getting out of foreign wars.  Troops may be needed elsewhere, maybe at home!  Such arguments have been applied to the American war in Viet Nam, and to the use of our troops in Iraq.  But this argument can't be applied to Israel: the Israeli troops are fighting for their homeland.  Miller implies that the Arabs are doing the same thing.  But they aren't.  They are the aggressors.  No one is demanding to attack them.  And until this basic asymmetry is addressed, there won't be progress towards peace.n indeed change some of its behavior.

And whether they are used in this way or not, those who use them ought to be aware of their meanings.<br /><br />This book does not make any strong points.  And it also tosses words around a little too freely.<br /><br />There is plenty that could be written about Western society.  Obviously, like all societies, ours has some problems.  And one ought to ask questions about whether we are too worshipful of consumer goods.  As well as whether our existence and happiness are too dependent on the overuse of non-renewable resources.  If that were true, it could be a serious flaw in the way we live.  After all, in the long run, which humans will dominate this planet?  Almost surely, it will be folks who will be relatively happy living on far fewer resources than we Westerners do now.<br /><br />On the other hand, the world of the far future is very unlikely to be dominated by those with the attitudes of some present critics of the West who favor nihilism, destruction, and arbitrary and reactionary opposition to human rights.  One of this book's big failings is that it does not dwell on these problems with the revolutionary Islamic opposition to Western society.<br /><br />The authors say that Israel has a \\"grotesque legally enshrined apartheid.\\"  That's a good example of just tossing words around without regard to their meanings.  Arabs live in Israel.  Israel is practically a bantustan in the middle of a vast Arab Empire.  Inverting the situation by calling Israel an apartheid state is simply a perverse misuse of words.  Of course, the authors do not stop there.  They dismiss Israeli self-defence out of hand, calling it \\"state violence.\\"  And they refer to \\"an increasingly extreme version of the Zionist project.\\"  That's a preposterous choice of words.  Zionism is simply Jewish nationalism.  It is based on universal human rights, and on the fact that if all humans are to have human rights, Jews (by virtue of being humans) must have human rights.  That is not extreme.  Of course, if Jews were greedy and laid claim to far more land than the share they could purchase if the entire planet were up for sale, one would indeed be able to refer to that as \\"extreme.\\"  And my point is that the Jews have not been greedy at all.  The argument about land is whether the more than 5 million Jews of Israel are to be permitted to live on 8000, 9000, 10,000 or 11,000 square miles.  Israel is land-poor.  The Arabs are the ones with 5,500,000 square miles, not the Jews.<br /><br />I think that getting rid of Israel would help no one.

Books	5	33	40	N	N	Some issues we ought to be thinking about	Is the West in a war against anti-Western forces in general, or against the Muslim world in particular?  There are some battles here and there.  But, luckily, we are not in an all out war right now.  The problem is that we could get into one.  And this book describes some of the threats we face.<br /><br />In the 1930s, there was a potential threat from Europe, given the political victories of nationalist extremists in Italy and Germany.  And at the end of the decade, this suddenly transformed itself into a serious threat.  Tony Blankley argues that this could happen again.  Europe could once again pose a problem.  Instead of National Socialism, the problem could now be jihadist Islam.<br /><br />I think the author makes several good points about what could happen.  First, he explains that political alliances could change fast.  Suppose there were another big terrorist attack on the United States, similar to the one on 9/11/2001.  Or perhaps a biological attack that killed hundreds of thousands of people or  more.  Afterwards, American leaders could change their views dramatically about how to deal with anti-Western terrorism.  And that might obliterate much of the cooperation between America and Europe.<br /><br />A big question for the author is how Europe will react to demographic changes which may lead to a much larger Muslim population there.  The problem is not simply a change in religious preferences.  That could mean more diversity and a stronger society.  The problem, as Blankley shows us, is that Islam these days has a large fundamentalist element.  That is what poses the same sort of threat that we saw in the 1930s.  This threat has been described by Bat Ye'or in her book, \\"Eurabia,\\"  and Blankley agrees that this problem is real.<br /><br />The author says that we need to be prepared for a number of basic scenarios that could play themselves out in Europe.  One is that jihadist Islam will basically take over in Europe, putting the United States at odds with it unless we adopt sharia here.  Another is that European governments will react to the jihadist threat in an organized manner, and pass some laws to alleviate it.  A third is that European governments will ignore this threat but vigilantes will not, leading to a big mess.  Of course, a fourth is that the threat will somehow disappear on its own (a big fight is bad for all sides), but we can't count on that.<br /><br />That brings us to the questions of what we'll need to do to protect ourselves.  Blankley discusses ethnic profiling, national identification cards, and the securing of borders.  And he also talks about some strategic advantages the West has, such as the alliance between America and Europe, as well as \\"globalization\\" (the fact that the world is becoming a much more connected place and that we're all becoming more of a single civilization).  In addition, he describes the extent to which Europe, in the past year or two, has been considering some protectionist measures.<br /><br />Could America wind up in a big war with our rights and values at stake?  We could.  And this is a good time for us to consider what we ought to do.  I recommend this book.ria here.

When the Levant has been most heavily populated, by the way, the majority of the population has indeed been Jewish, both in recent times and in ancient ones.<br /><br />In addition, there is a reason that there were relatively few Jews in the Levant for many centuries, and even relatively few Jews in the Jewish capital, Jerusalem.  It was very difficult for Jews to overcome regulations against immigrating to the region, buying land, building homes on land, or earning money there.  Once the Jews were emancipated, it is no surprise that many of them wanted to move to what is now Israel.<br /><br />Although the territory involved is far different, one can see a similar pattern in Russia.  For some time, after the Mongols killed most of the Russians, the Mongols were a big majority in Russia (although the total population was, of course, rather low).  Eventually, however, the Russians returned.  Harms does not make this point.<br /><br />Nor does Harms explain that there were plenty of Jews available to populate the Levant once they got their emancipation.  Those Jews bought land at high prices.  Yes, there were and are more Arabs than Jews.  But Arabs live on about 5.5 million square miles of land, while Israel, even if one includes the West Bank, is less than 11,000 square miles, 500 times less.<br /><br />That would have put some of the conflict into perspective, and reminded people that it does not infringe on the rights of others when one buys land on the open market at a fair price.<br /><br />This book, rather than accepting the fact of Jewish emancipation, blatantly sympathizes with racist opposition to Jews having human rights in the Levant.  Of course, as Harms says, the reader will be the judge of whether he's showing bias.  Well, I've made my judgment!<br /><br />We do not need the mix of statements from propagandists contained in this book.  We need an explanation of how things went wrong and what forces are keeping them wrong.  And this book not only fails to supply this but is part of the problem.Of course, as Harms says, the reader will be the judge of whether he's showing bias.

In the first chapter, Berman shows that the late 1970s brought home to many people just what the New Left had become: it had supported what became genocide in Cambodia and (roughly speaking) National Socialist policies by Arabs in the Levant.  These were exactly the policies the Left had opposed so strongly in the 1930s and 1940s.<br /><br />Of course, in the case of Zionism, the Left had switched sides in the past, supporting it in the early part of the twentieth century, opposing it in the 1920s and 1930s, supporting it in the 1940s, and opposing it once again in the 1950s and 1960s.  But that's not the point.  The Left had generally been against right-wing irredentism, racism, and genocide in the past.  And some of it clearly went over to it in the 1970s.<br /><br />In the next chapter, the author discusses some of the ideas of the European Left that \\"crossed the ocean,\\"  such as the Kyoto Protocols and the International Criminal Court.  During the Clinton administration, Berman explains that there was an appearance of cooperation between the United States and Europe on these issues.  But that fell apart in the present Bush administration.  Next, Berman discusses a little about the American Left and the Muslim world.  Do those who plead for human rights in the Muslim world get support from American Left?  Not all that much.<br /><br />We also discover how much support such rights get in Europe, and in France.  How many on the Left in France preferred an American victory over Saddam Hussein to an American defeat?<br /><br />Berman indicates that the ideas of the \\"generation of 1968,\\" which opposed the Vietnam war and intended to be activists in supporting human rights are not those of this generation.  The activists of 1968 wanted to be interventionists.  They wanted to oppose oppression.  But the ideas of today, on both the Left and Right, are a little different.<br /><br />I think this is a fascinating book, and I recommend it.erent.    <br /> <br />I think this is a fascinating book, and I recommend it.	2005-09-17

Those are both monotheistic religions (to me, they are both atheistic religions, given that there isn't any difference to me between believing in one God or zero).  So why did I read this book?  Because the author and I are both Zionists!  And I want to see what he has to say.<br /><br />The first point that Levitt makes is that the Arabs and Jews in the Middle East would all do well if they were to cooperate.  I agree.  They would.<br /><br />Now, is the land Arab or Jewish?  I'd advise taking note of the fact that when the Levant has been heavily populated, the majority has been Jewish.  Levitt says the land was given to the Jews by God.  I do not accept that.  But I accept the fact that this statement is taken seriously by many Jews!  And that means I can understand why Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital, and why many Jews have shown great interest in the region.  Levitt continues by saying that Jews have lived in the Levant for 3500 years, well before there were any Muslims anywhere.  That's true, but it still is ancient history.  He also says that the archaeology of the land is Jewish (all but one Levantine city existed in times when the Jews ruled).  And, most important, the Jews won their war for survival in 1967 (and in 1948, I would add).<br /><br />Now, what about the Muslims?  Are they trying to take over America?  As a descendant of Muslims, whose side would I be on if they tried it?  Well, I'm not too happy about Islamic intolerance and its treatment of women.  So it all comes down to whether we non-Muslims are already in a fight, or if we're the ones who are starting a fight.<br /><br />After 9/11, my guess is that we're already in a fight with at least some Muslims.  Levitt agrees, and he gives the incident of the fight over Notre Dame University's attempt to hire Tariq Ramadan as an example.<br /><br />What about the Levantine Arabs?  Are they a famous and ancient people, a nation from eons ago that merely wishes to have a State?  Or are they simply people who are trying to attack the Middle East's Jews?  I think the latter is the case, and Levitt agrees.  It seems that Levitt is making quite a few good points!<br /><br />What does the author say about Hanan Ashrawi?  Well, let's just say that he seems to agree with me about her as well.  And Levitt has some useful things to say about media anti-Israeli bias.  As well as some problems academia has been having in teaching about Israel.<br /><br />I'm not all that interested in the religious aspects of this book.  However, I can't ignore the fact that many Christians have taken sides.  Some favor the Muslims, even to the extent of supporting anti-Christian terror.  Some favor the Jews.  And the author has some ideas about which group is making more sense.<br /><br />I think there is plenty that can be learned from Levitt's book.  Unfortunately, many of the people who might benefit from it the most are unlikely to have much interest in reading it, let alone in taking anything in it seriously.d ancient people, a nation from eons ago that merely wishes to have a State?

51393:US	53071109	R1HO8BEV02P9G1	0974180408	329066428	Reply	Books	5	9	11	N	N	A clearly written reply to a serious travesty of justice	In 2003, the United Nations asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to render an advisory opinion about a barrier that Israel was building to defend its citizens from terror attacks.  The next year, the court delivered its advisory opinion.  But the opinion was simply a travesty that makes me mistrust international justice.  Now we have a book on the issue that clarifies what the court did that was so counterproductive and wrong.<br /><br />We discover that the Court showed bias when it accepted briefs from nations that neither recognize Israel's right to exist nor have diplomatic relations with it, as well as from a terrorist organization that is not a state at all.<br /><br />The next chapter shows that the right of Jews to settle anywhere in the Levant (present day Israel, including the West Bank and Gaza) was established for the British Mandate by the League of Nations in the 1920s, and remains in effect.<br /><br />While it is true that UN resolution 181 recommended the internationalization of Jerusalem, that resolution was simply a non-binding recommendation.  It is improper for the Court to treat it as more than that.  In addition, it is a myth to say that Jerusalem is traditionally Arab: it has had a Jewish majority since the 1870s.  Resolution 181 also recommended the partition plan.  Again, that was non-binding, and relied on acceptance by both parties to have any legal status.  It did not get that acceptance by the Arab states, who vowed to defy it by force, and who kept that vow.<br /><br />The UN's Article 51 says that nothing shall impair the rights of people, individually or collectively, to defend themselves against an attack of their state.  Israel was indeed attacked.  The Court said that did not count because the attacker was not a state.  But Article 51 does not require the attacker to be a state.  And the Court has no mandate to amend this article.  Nevertheless, the Court went on from there to completely disregard the terrorism that caused the barrier to be built in the first place, ignoring many applicable UN resolutions that would have required a different conclusion.  It also blithely called Israel an aggressor in spite of the fact that only the Security Council, within the UN, can label a Member state as such (the Security Council has never labeled Israel as an aggressor).<br /><br />The author discusses UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338.  These do not brand Israel as an \\"unlawful occupier,\\" or an \\"aggressor.\\"  They do not call for Israel to withdraw from all the \\"territories.\\"  These simple facts seem to be ignored by the Court.<br /><br />Hertz notes that the Court calls the building of a barrier to protect the lives of Israelis is \\"tantamount to de facto annexation\\" of some West Bank land.  Um, there could be some truth to that.  But Hertz asks if the ICJ's arbitrary claim that the entire West Bank (including the eastern part of Jerusalem) is Arab isn't even more clearly tantamount to unlawful de facto annexation.  I agree with Hertz.  In addition, I think that demands for this area to be made Jew-free go beyond even that.  Obviously, if Jews are not even allowed to be on such land, that weakens their case for already having title to it.<br /><br />In fact, as the author explains, the only part of the Mandate in which Jews could at some point be excluded from settling in was that portion east of the Jordan River, that is, in present-day Jordan.  By the way, this sort of rule seems arbitrary and racist to me, a little like counting each Black as 3/5 of a person.  We neither see corresponding rules counting Whites as fractional people, nor rules excluding Arabs from settling in Israel.<br /><br />The author concludes that there's no distinction between genocide and the undoing of a nation such as Israel by an international court such as the one at The Hague.  And that denying Israel's right to self-defense in favor of Arab terrorism is a crime against humanity.  I agree.  And I highly recommend this book.	2005-09-16

Minorities can be protected by the \\"bulwark\\" of human rights.  But this bulwark has been removed by the anti-Zionists for the sake of attacking some Jews.  Matas claims that only the destruction of Israel will satisfy the anti-Zionists.  I disagree.  Israel is not a problem, so I see no reason why the destruction of Israel would even begin to satisfy the anti-Zionists.<br /><br />Of course, Israel itself is accused of human rights violations.  Matas discusses them: genocide, colonialism, terrorism, war crimes, crimes against humanity, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing.  As the author shows, these accusations are bogus.  But as he says, there is a danger in even taking such accusations seriously.  The questions of whether such accusations are valid are themselves the problem.  We can ask how many Christians the Jews killed yesterday in order to drain their blood for use in baking their bread.  But if we do, we are way out of line.  And a \\"serious\\" discussion of anti-Zionist charges just plays into the hands of the racists.<br /><br />There is a good chapter on the charge of Israeli \\"occupation\\" of the West Bank.  And a chapter on the Israeli settlements, which points out that the issue is simply the racist one that Jews are living in the neighborhood.  As Matas says, \\"it is a moral duty to repel opposition to the settlements.\\"  I strongly agree.  Some folks say that it is a crime to allow Jews to live in the West Bank.  But the author makes the point that the criminals would then be those who permit it: the settlers themselves would be innocent.  And the author asks how something can possibly be a crime when everyone agrees that those who actually commit the act are doing nothing wrong.  That's a question I never thought of!<br /><br />Matas points out the bias involved in demanding that the West Bank be Jew-free but not making the equally outrageous demand that Israel be Arab-free.  Yet Amnesty International (as the author points out) did just that in a September, 2003 report, demanding that Jews be forcibly evacuated from the West Bank and Gaza.<br /><br />Now, what about the question of forcible transfer of populations, which is against the Protocol on International Armed Conflict?  Well, the author says that the rule is just fine.  It should be supported.  The problem is with its use: Israel is falsely accused of violating it.<br /><br />There is an excellent chapter on the well-known Israeli fence.  This is sometimes called a \\"wall\\" even though less than 3% of the completed barrier will be a wall, \\"and much of that wall portion has been in existence for years.\\"  As Matas says, \\"every time a court gives judgment, justice itself is on trial.\\"<br /><br />Obviously, the International Court ruling against Israel's barrier was a grave violation of justice.  But the biggest problem, according to the author, was for the Court to take the case at all.  It certainly did not take cases such as the failure of the ruling authority to oppose Levantine Arab suicide bombers, or incitement to hatred, or other terrorism, or the funding of terrorist activities.  Taking any of these cases means taking sides in a conflict.  I strongly agree with the author.  Many years ago, I was shocked to see the United Nations taking sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict at all (although I was also surprised that it took the side of the aggressors).<br /><br />There is a section on the supposed Levantine Arab \\"right of return\\" to Israel.  Matas shows that this is all nonsense: Israel simply is not the country of the Levantine Arabs.<br /><br />Are there rights to self-determination and statehood?  Once again, the author is right on the money.  All peoples have a right to self-determination.  None have aright to statehood.  Statehood may be a necessity, for self-protection.  But it is not a human right.  And I agree.  Israel is a state because the British White Paper of 1939, among other things, made Israeli statehood a necessity to protect human rights.<br /><br />What is to be done about anti-Zionism?  The author and I agree that it has to be fought on the basis of human rights.  As Matas says, \\"a document that is part racist is all bad.\\"  And, \\"there is no hierarchy of rights.\\"  He explains that \\"Durban was a disaster, a racist conference in the name of anti-racism.\\"  And he opens his book with a chapter on the awful 2001 Durban conference.<br /><br />There is a question of what to do about the UN.  Should one oppose it or try to reform it?  I favor opposing it (actually, I'd outlaw it).  Matas does not want to give up on it.  But he does explain that there are alternatives to the UN.  One of them is the UN's ideals!<br /><br />There are complaints that the Levantine Arabs are \\"underdogs.\\"  But the author points out that those Levantine Arabs \\"who seek death are always going to be worse off than Jews who embrace life.\\"  He encourages those who wish to support the Arabs to wean them from self-destruction.  After all, a true friend does not tell a potential suicide to jump!<br /><br />One campaign Matas suggests is to fight against the victimization of Arab children by anti-Zionism.  This ugly philosophy simply violates human rights by teaching such self-destructive hatred.  It is not part of a culture, but a violation of it.  Once again, I agree.<br /><br />This is truly an excellent book.  Everyone ought to read it right away!it is not a human right.  And I agree.

I liked their postage stamps.  I thought that they did a good job with international tasks such as eliminating smallpox and at least a useful one with, say, Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />Still, I had to notice that the UN was not very effective in times of conflict.  Whether the conflicts were in Africa, the Middle East, the Far East, or Europe, the UN always seemed helpless at best.  In 1974, when Arafat was applauded there, I began to have more serious doubts about how it was doing.  And within a few years, the values of its postage stamps fell dramatically.  For me, that was confirmation that the UN itself was of very low value.  And since then, I've been in favor of getting rid of it.  I think it is just too perverse to be of much help to the people of this planet.  We could replace it by restricting ourselves to sets of bilateral agreements, or by creating ad hoc single-issue international organizations, issue by issue (to avoid building up too much esteem, which would permit their perversion).  We could also have competing advice-giving organizations that could stand or fall on their own merits (poor ones would go out of business).<br /><br />Well, just how bad is the UN?  This book gives us an idea about the UN, and the Secretariat in particular.  Incredibly, the Secretariat employs over 6000 people and costs over 2 billion dollars per year.  And I may be biased, but I find it hard to believe that it serves any useful purpose at all.<br /><br />Sanjuan describes the amount of Soviet influence and control in the Secretariat, which extended to, for example, the UN library.  By the way, one of the few people the author has kind words for is the present US ambassador to the UN, John Bolton.  Among other things, Bolton helped get the infamous UN resolution repealed that equated Zionism and racism.<br /><br />The author describes some of the endemic anti-semitism at the UN.  To me, it seems surreal.  It is a little like hearing that the UN is against Martians, and that many people there suspect that quite a few of the people they meet are related to Martians, or are Martian-lovers, or are friends of Martians.  And that there is a vast Martian conspiracy to run the United States or worse.  In any case, these sorts of fantasies can't be productive.  In addition, they have to be bad for real live Jews, even though such people rarely resemble the fantasy ones.  And the assault on rationality, sanity, and truth has to be bad as well.<br /><br />Sanjuan describes some of the ways that the UN wastes money.  But I think that may be the least of its problems.<br /><br />The book finishes with ten modest recommendations from the author.  He's against UN Secretariat's nepotism, conflicts of interest, antisemitism, racism, moonlighting, contacts with local and international crime, corruption, espionage, and support for terrorism.  And he thinks that members of the Secretariat that engage in them \\"ought to be relieved of their posts.\\"  That's nice, but I think the UN is unsalvageable.  We humans do not need it, we can do better without it, and if we really need to, we can create a much better organization than the UN.<br /><br />This book is very readable, and I highly recommend it.ke hearing that the UN is against Martians, and that many people there suspect that quite a few of the people they meet are related to Martians, or are Martian-lovers, or are friends of Martians.

And Grosbard does want Israelis to modify their behavior, and try to imagine how they  appear to others.  That's a good idea!<br /><br />That idea is worth a star!  And I gave this book a star.<br /><br />Behavior modification is a tricky subject.  It means accepting truth, not meekly admitting to false accusations.  It means being generous and pleasant whenever given a chance to do so.  But it also means drawing a line.  It does not mean supporting others in criminal behavior.  And it certainly does not mean relinquishing any claims (for oneself and one's community) to the human rights of life, liberty, or property.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book did not distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior in this regard.  It encouraged Jews to accept wild Arab complaints as valid.  That's not the way to have harmony among a mixed population!<br /><br />I also think there needs to be more of a discussion of Arabs on the couch.  After all, the Arabs are the ones who can make peace.  It might be a good idea if they understood why many Jews do not entirely trust some of them.  And it might also be a good idea to see what it could mean to value truth in order to achieve a peace that would result in everyone being happier and more prosperous.	2005-09-07

After all, it spends a significant amount of time discussing the Levant.  And what it says seems so wrong that it makes me doubt the trustworthiness of the entire book.  Falk insists that Arafat was the only legitimate representative of the Levantine Arabs, whom he treats as a people whose rights have been violated by the Jews.  As near as I can tell, he's simply blaming the victims.<br /><br />Suppose his side is triumphant.  What then?  Well, if that happens, folks will get to steal a little land from the land-poor Jews.  And that seems unproductive.  Suppose a robber steals your last dollar.  The robber will gain very little.  You will have lost \\"everything,\\" but you will not have lost much (especially if you have a high-paying job!).  I think it would be far better for people to value truth than to jettison it just for a chance to rob or oppress a few Middle Eastern Jews.  Valuing truth might lead to peace agreements which could reduce strife and increase happiness and prosperity.  Devaluing it can lengthen conflicts.<br /><br />And that means that this book may not have much for others.<br /><br />We do see a bunch of different \\"perspectives\\" on various issues, especially in the 2001 Report of the UN commission on human rights.  But all that accomplishes is to put truth and falsehood on an even basis (at best), so that either might be chosen.<br /><br />Books such as this one are way off track.  We need to go back to basics.  That includes the truth about the history and geography of the region, as well as an understanding of what various groups of people have wanted, worked for, and fought for.<br /><br />There is one more problem with blaming the victims in the Levant and stealing land from them.  Namely, the justification will be that it is proper to punish thieves and reclaim stolen property.  If I were a thief, I'd want to avoid making that into a precedent.	2005-09-07

What case was it supposed to make?  Maybe the case that there was an ancient Levantine Arab People who were unjustly treated and who now deserve Justice?  Or the case that Jews are special, and must be denied the right to buy land and live on it, even in their homeland?<br /><br />Well, the book begins by explaining why Jews, who were being seriously mistreated in Europe (and elsewhere) wanted to move to the Levant.  But it basically says that it was fundamentally unjust for Jews to purchase land there, since that displaced the farmers who lived on it.<br /><br />Now, maybe the author knows something about law.  But I think what he says is so unhelpful that it does not matter how much he knows about law, or how little I know about it.  Such a claim by him is either founded in law (and he says it is) or it isn't.  And it really doesn't matter.  If that claim is not founded in law, we ought to toss his book away.  If it is founded in law, then the law has to say one of two things.  Either it is illegal for any human to be born, since all of us displace folks just by existing.  Or it is illegal for certain untermenschen to have any rights, which is a racist set of laws that I reject.  I'm sure the German National Socialists were proud of their laws.  But at some point, we have to reject bad laws.  And if people who need and want land, which is for sale by willing sellers, are not allowed to purchase it, even though they are high bidders, and even though lower bidders are allowed to buy it, we need to reject such laws.<br /><br />There are plenty of things wrong with Quigley's arguments.  But the most fundamental is that the answers are wrong.<br /><br />Quigley dismisses ancient claims to the Levant.  That's fine with me.  But he's selective about it.  Jewish claims, Pagan claims, and Byzantine claims are considered bogus.  Arab claims, on the other hand, are legitimate!  That's a little silly, especially given that Arabs only lightly populated the region, were not sovereign there for centuries, and were the majority only because they didn't let Jews enter in significant numbers.<br /><br />Quigley discusses the question of Levantine Arab \\"distinctiveness.\\"  That's a good question!  After all, it is more than a technicality to say, ex post facto, that your fist always had a right to be where someone else's nose turned up!  Inventing a particular Arab people and claiming that they had a right to all Jewish land and no other land seems like the same deal.  Their fists have rights, Jewish noses do not.  But Quigley claims that Levantine Arab distinctiveness is irrelevant because Arabs lived there!  Um, that's ridiculous.  Mongols lived in Russia, and outnumbered the Russians once the Mongols had killed most of the Russians.  But the Mongols populated the region only lightly.  It was a Mongol colony, not the Mongol homeland.  And the Russians reclaimed it.  It is quite relevant that the Levant was an underpopulated backwater of an Arab Empire which housed Jerusalem, the Jewish capital.  It explains why Jews outbid Arabs for one parcel of land after another once they had a chance to do so.<br /><br />And, oh yes, Arab aggression against Israel in 1948 and 1967 is somehow called Israeli aggression.  And Israeli towns in the West Bank are called illegal.<br /><br />One can't do everything in a book.  One can't toss absurd and false taunts at a party to a dispute and still present a well-reasoned case.  Quigely had a choice to make.  He could state his complaints honestly and sincerely, and try to make a case.  Or he could taunt Zionists.  He chose to do the latter.  That precluded him from making a case in favor of anyone.  Maybe he had a bad case in the first place, but I still think he ought to have done better than this.on, were not sovereign there for centuries, and were the majority only because they didn't let Jews enter in significant numbers.

The question of what makes consciousness is in itself an interesting field.  And we know that consciousness resides in the brain.  We even know what sorts of injuries make people semi-conscious.  And we are making progress with the question of where consciousness resides.<br /><br />But what makes us not merely conscious, but ourselves?  Why isn't someone other than you, um, you?  Someone who looks just like you would not be you.  Your twin isn't you.  And, as the author explains, even a duplicate of you would not be you either.  If one of the two of you had to be killed, you would be quick to choose the other!<br /><br />The book includes a discussion of genes.  But this is merely background: we already know that we are not the same as our twins.  Now, what about what feels a little like a religious issue: do we have a chance to find ourselves resurrected as other beings in the future?  If copies of us arose in the distant future, would we sense that we had awakened?  Meanwhile, what could happen to us during our actual lives so that we'd appear to still be ourselves and conscious but would no longer really be us?<br /><br />The author considers a couple more questions of this sort.  Suppose our brain patterns could be put into a computer.  Would we feel that we existed, as ourselves, in that computer?  And here is another one.  Suppose we could slowly inherit the brain patterns of someone else.  Would we be destroyed in the process, even though it all felt continuous?  We'd become a little different.  But would we really die?  Would the person whose brain patterns we inherited come back to life?<br /><br />And finally, we get to probabilities.  Superficially, it might seem that the probability that you would exist in the first place was pretty much zero.  And that therefore it is unlikely that you will ever exist again.  But that probability might be much higher than zero.  We just don't know.  And that could mean that the probability that you will exist again is higher as well.  It would help if we were sure what makes one aware of being oneself as an individual, not just aware.  But so far we don't even know that.  I think that it is significant that none of us really appear to be aware of having existed before.  But that alone doesn't prove much.<br /><br />At least, Wright has shown us what the issues are, and what we know about them so far.<br /><br />I recommend this book.again is higher as well.

Books	5	14	16	N	N	A good book about the Veresov	Can one use the Veresov as one's regular chess opening?  Of course.  But I wouldn't recommend it, simply because I think it's useful to be more versatile, and to be prepared to play whatever opening you feel your opponent will have trouble with.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it may be the Veresov itself that your opponent will be unprepared for.  And you may want to have the Veresov in reserve, either as a surprise weapon or as a backup in case something goes wrong with your main opening during a tournament.<br /><br />Once in a while, I use the Veresov as a surprise weapon.  When I do, I start with 1 Nc3.  If my opponent answers with 1...e5 or 1...c5, I'm ready to play a Vienna or a Closed Sicilian.  But if I get 1...Nf6 or 1...d5, they get the Veresov.<br /><br />Davies examines all the main lines in this opening.  After 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nc3 d5 3 Bg5, Black's most frequent move is 3...Nbd7.  But Black also has 3...c5 (maybe the best reply), 3...c6, 3...e6, 3...Bf5, 3...h6, 3...Nc6, and 3...g6.  There is a chapter on what to do if Black does not reply to 1 d4 d5 2 Nc3 with 2...Nf6 and instead plays 2...e6 or 2...f5 or 2...c6.  As well as a chapter on what to do if Black, after 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nc3, avoids 2...d5 and instead plays 2...c5, 2...d6, or 2...g6.<br /><br />I used to play 4 f3 against 3...Nbd7, 3...c6, or 3...Bf5.  But Davies has convinced me that 4 e3 is superior against all these moves and is good against 3...c5 as well.  That's especially the case against 3...Nbd7, where the idea is to play f4 and then f5 (Black's Knight on d7 often prevents the Black Bishop from covering f5).  Here is an example that Davies gives of 4 e3:<br /><br />1 d4 Nf6 2 Nc3 d5 3 Bg5 Nbd7 4 e3 g6 5 f4 Bg7 6 Nf3 0-0 7 Bd3 b6 8 0-0 Bb7 9 f5 c5 10 fxg6 hxg6 11 Qe1 Ne4 12 Qh4 f6? 13 Nxe4 dxe4 14 Bc4+ winning the exchange for nothing.<br /><br />I will also show a game that Davies gives in the 4 f3 line which began the same way as a game I played with White:<br /><br />Both games started with 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nc3 d5 3 Bg5 Nbd7 4 f3 c5 5 e4 dxe4 6 d5 exf3 7 Nxf3. In my game, Black tried 7...Nb6 8 Bb5+ Bd7 9 Qe2 Qc7 10 0-0-0 Bxb5 11 Nxb5 (White is already winning) 11...Qd7 12 Ne5 Qd8 13 d6 Rc8 14 d7+ Nfxd7 15 Nxd7 Rc6 16 Nxf8 Black Resigns.

The most popular choice is 2 Nf3.  Black's most popular reply is 2...Nc6.  And the most popular choice for White at this point is 3 Bb5, the Ruy Lopez.  Black's most popular choice now is 3...a6.  Now what?<br /><br />Well, I think it is just fine to retreat that White Bishop to a4.  That's the most popular move.  But Black has plenty of choices at this point.  Maybe you'll see a deferred Steinitz variation.  Or an Open Lopez.  Or a Closed Ruy, such as the Chigorin, the Breyer, the Smyslov, or the Zaitsev.  Or even a sideline such as the Archangelsk or the Moeller.  Or maybe the well-known Marshall (unless you play an anti-Marshall).<br /><br />Or maybe you won't see any of them.  You can chop down that Black Knight now.  With the Exchange Variation.  And try heading for a pleasant endgame in which, if you win, it will seem like Black never had a chance.<br /><br />This book shows all the important lines in the Exchange variation.  It has 74 complete and annotated games as examples.  And 21 of those games are from the years 2001 to 2004.<br /><br />If you want to learn this opening for White, there are some lines you will need to know.  The main ones, after 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 a6 4 Bxc6 dxc6 5 0-0 are:<br /><br />5...Be6 6 Nxe5 Qd4 7 Nf3 Qxe4 8 Ng5<br /><br />5...Qf6 6 d4 exd4 7 Bg5<br /><br />5...Qe7 6 d4 exd4, where you have to decide between 7 Qxd4 and 7 Nxd4<br /><br />5...Be7 where you must choose between 6 Nxe5 and 6 d3<br /><br />5...Ne7 6 Nxe5 Qd4 7 Qh5<br /><br />5...Bd6 6 d4 exd4 7 Qxd4<br /><br />5...Bg4 6 h3 h5 7 d3 Qf6 where you must choose between 8 Be3 and 8 Nbd2<br /><br />5...Qd6 6 Na3 Be6 7 Qe2 f6 8 Rd1<br /><br />5...Qd6 6 Na3 b5 7 c3 c5 8 Nc2 Bb7 9 Re1<br /><br />5...f6 6 d4 exd4 7 Nxd4 c5 8 Nb3 Qxd1 9 Rxd1 Bg4 10 f3<br /><br />5...f6 6 d4 Bg4 7 dxe5 Qxd1 8 Rxd1 fxe5 9 Nbd2 0-0-0 10 Re1<br /><br />The book also mentions moves other than 5 0-0 for White, and it even mentions 4...bxc6 for Black.<br /><br />The fundamental strategic idea behind this opening for White is to get all the pieces off the board somehow and win the resulting endgame by getting a passed pawn on the Kingside.  Black is generally happy to exchange the Queens.  But Black will be very slow to exchange anything else, and will fight hard to keep her Bishop pair.<br /><br />I'll give an example of this opening from one of my own games, one I remember quite well:<br /><br />1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 Bb5 a6 4 Bxc6 dxc6 5 0-0 Bg4 6 h3 h5 7 d3 (obviously, White can't take the Bishop without losing her Knight or getting mated) 7...Qf6 8 Be3 Bxf3 9 Qxf3 Qxf3 (Black may have messed up White's pawn structure and removed the Queens, but at the cost of the Bishop pair) 10 gxf3 g6 (this is not good: Black has to try to stop White from getting in f4; in addition, the Black Knight may belong on g6) 11 f4 Bg7 12 fxe5 Bxe5 13 c3 0-0-0 14 d4 Bg7 15 Nd2 Nf6 16 f3 Bh6 17 Kf2 Bxe3+ 18 Kxe3 Rhe8 19 c4 Nh7 20 Rg1 Nf8 21 Rad1 Ne6 22 Nb3 b6 23 d5 cxd5 24 cxd5 Ng7 25 Kf4 Rd7 26 Nd4 Red8 27 Rc1 Rd6 28 Nc6 R8d7 29 Rg2 Rf6+ 30 Ke3 Ne8<br /><br />See how easy that was?  White has practically effortlessly obtained what ought to be a winning position.  Black hasn't had a chance to do anything.  Of course, any position can be compromised.  And White proved it:<br /><br />31 Kd4? (any reasonable move wins, and 31 e5 may be best) Rxf3 32 Ne5?? (White was already worse, but this hangs a Rook to 32...c5+).  Of course, the fact that White made these awful errors will be a secret just among us.<br /><br />I recommend this book.ard somehow and win the resulting endgame by getting a passed pawn on the Kingside.

74121:US	53071109	R30K4URKTI8IAS	1903900727	950125458	Jews and Australian Politics	Books	4	0	1	N	N	All about the political significance of Australian Jewry	This book consists of thirteen articles about the politics involving Australian Jewry.  It begins with a nice article on demographics by John Goldlust.  Next, Suzanne Rutland tells us about groups that speak for Australian Jews.  Next are articles about Jewish participation in Australia's political parties.  Jews traditionally supported Labor, but in the past couple of decades, they have become more conservative.<br /><br />As Philip Mendes explains, Jews tended to support the Left politically, because the Left sided with the liberal idea of political and legal equality for all.  Many on the Left criticize the politics of Israel, but that alone is not a problem: many Jews do the same.  However, as Mendes tells us, \\"much of the Australian Left\\" goes beyond what I would call mere criticism.  Some \\"argue that Israel is a racist and colonial state which has no right to exist.\\"  That, to my mind, is a reactionary and racist position to take.  In addition, those who take this position \\"extends the denunciation of Israel to include all Jews - Zionist or otherwise - who are supportive of Israel's existence.\\"  Mendes argues that this \\"ethnic stereotyping of all Israelis or all Jews as 'oppressors' is highly intimidating and offensive to most Jews, and is hardly likely to attract younger Jews to the organized left.\\"  My feeling is that those who wish to support social justice and humanitarian causes, Jewish or not, will need to look elsewhere.  The problem is that such groups on the \\"Left\\" simply do not abide human rights.<br /><br />William Rubenstein makes a couple of points about Australian Jews, namely their relative geographical and residential stability.  That is contrasted to America's Jewry, many of whom have moved from what are now slum areas in New York to suburbs in the American West and South.<br /><br />What about anti-Semitism?  Is it a problem in Australia?  Not really.  But there are a couple of things worth monitoring.  One of them is the \\"One Nation\\" party, which obtained 23% of the vote in the 1998 Queensland elections.<br /><br />How about feminism?  There is a good chapter by Barbara Bloch and Eva Cox that discusses the involvement of Jewish women in Australian feminist movements.  Many do this from within Judaism, using Jewish ideas, rather than as rebels.<br /><br />What do Jews think of another Australian minority, namely the Aborigines?  Actually, it hasn't been a big issue.  As Colin Tatz explains, race politics has not been a violent issue in Australia.  In addition, Jews have not traditionally had a great deal of contact with Aborigines.  Perhaps that is why they have not made Aborigine rights more of an issue.<br /><br />The final two chapters deal with what I think are two major issues.  First is the problem with a television station, SBS (Special Broadcasting Service).  As Chanan Reich reports, that station, in its \\"World News\\" programs, has displayed consistently displayed anti-Israeli bias, factual inaccuracy, and editorializing.  It called the one pro-Israeli program it showed (in 1996, called \\"A Nation is Born\\" written by Abba Eban) \\"'a partisan view'\\" but it never called the numerous and overwhelmingly anti-Israeli programs partisan.  I consider this a major problem.  It appears that this station is happy to make a mockery of journalistic standards just to attack a few Jews, and that ought to concern us all.<br /><br />The final chapter deals with a big embarrassment to Australia, namely the indecent awarding of the Sydney University Peace Foundation's peace prize, in August, 2003, to an infamous thug, Hanan Ashrawi.  Ashrawi has served the cause of death and destruction well, by being a minister of education for Yasir Arafat, where she helped teach children hate propaganda.  It would be hard to find a person less suitable for a peace prize.  However, there are precedents for such indecency: Arafat himself grabbed a Nobel Peace Prize.<br /><br />Mendes and Geoffrey Levey discuss the Ashrawi award.  Iagree with them that the issue ought to have been Ashrawi's suitability (actually unsuitability) for the award, and not the actions of Australia's Jews in protesting it.  On the other hand, they feel that by regarding Ashrawi as an extremist, they were refusing to engage in \\"reasoned debate about her suitability.\\"  I can't blame that on Australia's Jews.  Ashrawi is as bad as they come, and I think everyone has a duty to say so when she is recommended for such ill-deserved praise.  I deducted a star from my rating for the authors' failure to make that point.<br /><br />I still recommend this book.s the Ashrawi award.

Now you are all prepared for Black side of a Ruy Lopez.  But your opponent comes up with 3 Bc4.  What do you play?<br /><br />You could play 3...Be7, as a surprise in case you know the Hungarian Defence much better than your opponent.  And if you have reason to believe that your opponent wants to play, say, a Moeller Attack and not an Evans Gambit, you probably ought to try 3...Bc5.  Otherwise, I think 3...Nf6 is a good choice.  And this book will teach you about it.<br /><br />According to this book, White has three basic moves after 3...Nf6, namely 4 Ng5, 4 d4, and 4 d3. Statistically, none of them are all that good for White.<br /><br />After 4 Ng5, the main line is 4...d5 5 exd5 Na5 6 Bb5+ c6 7 dxc6 bxc6 8 Be2 h6 9 Nf3 e4 10 Ne5 Bd6 11 d4 exd3 12 Nxd3 Bc7 13 b3.  And we see a game in this line, as well as several games in various sidelines.<br /><br />Still, I think the most interesting of the divergences is for Black to play 4...Bc5.  This is the infamous Traxler or Wilkes-Barre Variation, and Pinski gives it a 26-page chapter in this book.  There are also books by Williams, by Estrin, and by Palkovi just on this move, by the way.  It's wild.  Statistically, Black does very well, but of the Grandmasters, Beliavsky is one of the few to play it.<br /><br />I tried the Wilkes-Barre a couple of times.  Here's an example where I won quickly:  1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bc4 Nf6 4 Ng5 Bc5 5 Nxf7 (5 Bxf7 is better) 5...Bxf2+ 6 Kxf2 Nxe4+ 7 Ke3 (7 Kg1 is probably better) 7...Qh4 8 Qf3 (8 g3 is much better) 8...Ng5 9 Nxg5 Qxg5+ 10 Kd3 Rf8 11 Qe2 Qf5+ 12 Kc3 e4 (I'm threatening mate!) 13 a3 (rats, he saw it) 13...d5 14 Bb5 d4+ 15 Kb3 Be6+ 16 Ka4 d3! (Winning the Queen, since I'm threatening mate again!) 17 Qe3 (overlooking the mate) 17...Qxb5+ 18 White Resigns.<br /><br />Of course, White does not have to play 4 Ng5.  There are three chapters covering 4 d4 exd4.  White gets nowhere with 5 0-0, so her best chance is 5 e5, but we see that Black is still fine after 5...d5.<br /><br />The final chapter deals with another White alternative, 4 d3.  And with the Black reply 4...Be7.  I do not recommend this line for Black (look over the game where Ivanchuk, with Black, loses to Macieja, and you may agree with me).  I think it is better to play 4...Bc5 and transpose into a Giuoco Pianissimo, which Pinski calls (in his book on the Italian Game and Evans Gambit), \\"The Italian Regretted.\\"<br /><br />Actually, White can try other moves.  To prove it, I'll give one more game where I won quickly with Black:<br /><br />1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bc4 Nf6 4 0-0 (this move looks dubious, and it is not mentioned in this book) 4...Nxe4 (4...Bc5 may be better) 5 Re1 (5 Nc3 is better) 5...d5 6 Bb5 Bc5 7 Rf1 Bg4 8 Bxc6+ bxc6 9 d3 Qf6 (moving my Knight might make more sense) 10 dxe4 dxe4 11 h3 Bh5 12 g4 exf3 13 gxh5 (finally winning a piece, but things definitely look black for White) 13...Rd8 14 Qe1 Qf5 15 Qc3 0-0 16 Kh2 e4 17 Rg1 Bd6+ (this forces mate) 18 White Resigns.<br /><br />I recommend this book.e with 5 0-0, so her best chance is 5 e5, but we see that Black is still fine after 5...d5. <br /> <br />The final chapter deals with another White alternative, 4 d3.

Every so often in the past few centuries, some folks have told us, in effect, that we are faced with what I think is a false choice: human rights for some minority (say, Pagans or Jews) or human rights for everyone.  In my opinion, human rights for everyone do not preclude human rights for Pagans, Jews, or Arabs.  In fact, such rights are required or at least some people will not have them.<br /><br />In this misleading book, Susan Nathan reports on what it's like to be an Arab in Israel.  Not in the disputed West Bank, but on the Israeli side of the 1966 borders.  And it is no fun being connected by nationality not just to people who are at war with the nation you live in, but who deny your nation a right to exist or to protect the rights of its citizens.<br /><br />Nathan shows that even supposedly liberal Israelis seem to be reluctant to hire or promote Arabs over Jews.  And she gives a number of examples in which Arabs face discrimination.  But it seems to me that she's implying that unless Jewish Israelis are unfair to Arabs, Israel's ability to protect Jewish rights will be destroyed.  And I see such an implication as both false and racist.  In my opinion, everyone would be better off were Jewish Israelis to treat Arabs more fairly.<br /><br />Nathan spends plenty of time espousing some really ugly anti-Zionist propaganda.  She blasts the Israeli action in Jenin in April of 2002, in spite of the fact that Israel went so far out of its way to risk the lives of its soldiers to reduce civilian casualties.  And she says that the liberation of the Jews came at the expense of another people's bereavement.  That is outrageous: all humans gain when folks are emancipated.<br /><br />The author says that she was taught a Zionist story that nineteenth-century Israel was \\"'a land without people.'\\"  Actually, the original quote, which is by just one rather controversial person, is that it was \\"a land without a people.\\"  That's very different.  And I regard it as no innocent error on her part.<br /><br />Nathan considers Israel to promote a racist view of Arabs, but she's got no critique of Arab racism.  She also says that the Israelis steal land from the Arabs.  Now, that is an interesting viewpoint.  And it leads me to ask what would happen were all humans to be honest and color-blind.  Well, I think the 5 million Jews in Israel would have little difficulty buying up far more land than the 8,000 to 11,000 square miles they now have, especially since they might be joined by some of the roughly equal number of Diaspora Jews.  And I think they'd keep that land and make excellent use of it.  Instead, Nathan implies that Israeli Jews are getting away with something by being allowed to live in Israel.<br /><br />The author realizes that some Jews may feel she is betraying them.  That ought to be the least of her worries.  I suspect that those who find the most problems with her book will be those who value truth and human rights, independent of what religious views they may have.<br /><br />Today, Nathan says that the Jews who bought land at high prices in their homeland are in fact living on someone else's land.  Tomorrow, someone with an equal lack of regard for truth may say the same thing about Arabs.  The truth is that all of us are living right here, on this planet.  Not on someone else's land.  We humans have a right to be here on this planet, whatever Susan Nathan may say.no innocent error on her part. <br /> <br />Nathan considers Israel to promote a racist view of Arabs, but she's got no critique of Arab racism.

And the extreme values it gives are actually fairly interesting and fun to read about.  Besides, we all like to know if we're in the middle of truly unusual weather.<br /><br />The book starts with heat records for every state, both absolute maximums and July averages.  As well as maps showing number of days with 90-degree (Fahrenheit) or higher temperatures.  We learn about temperature-humidity indexes, heat waves, and even heat bursts.  As well as extremes in temperature ranges.  There's information about heat extremes in foreign countries as well.<br /><br />Next we get to cold weather!  Heat records for every state, both absolute minimums and January averages.  Cold waves.  Wind chill.  And international extremes.  Did you know that near Lake Vostok, in Antarctica, the temperature once reached minus 128.6 degrees Fahrenheit?  Brrrr!<br /><br />We learn about the snowiest cities.  And then we get to rainfall records for a big bunch of American cities.  There are also records for varying amounts of time.  What's the record for rainfall in 30 minutes?  It's over 11 inches!  And it fell in Sikeshugou, China.  And there's material about floods, thunderstorms, hail, and tornadoes.  As well as wind and fog!<br /><br />There is a fascinating chapter on hurricanes.  I vividly remember Hurricane Carol, which struck in August of 1954.  And there's a picture of Providence, Rhode Island, after it was hit by the storm surge from that hurricane.  There is also an excellent map of the American Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean coasts, with probabilities per year of being hit by a hurricane, as well as probabilities of being hit by 125 mile-per-hour winds or greater.  The five areas that in 2004 that were \\"overdue\\" for a hurricane are listed.  Of course, as any technical person knows, being \\"overdue\\" for a storm does not increase the chance of being hit, if anything, it decreases it.  But it does imply that one may be less prepared for one when it does hit.  New Orleans is listed as one of the five areas (it was hit by Betsy in 1965 and not hit again until Katrina in 2005).  The book explains that the dikes protecting downtown New Orleans, including the French Quarter, from the water in Lake Pontchartrain would almost certainly be overwhelmed by a Category 4 or 5 storm surge.  And that if they were, much of that area could be swamped under 20 feet of water.  I wish that more people with the responsibility for protecting the city of New Orleans (or voting for its protection) had been more aware of this, so that some of the damage caused by Katrina might have been lessened.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.is listed as one of the five areas (it was hit by Betsy in 1965 and not hit again until Katrina in 2005).

No, this book should not be banned.  For one thing, our freedoms are important.  Once we start banning books that tell dangerous lies, we'll have set a precedent for banning others.  And one day maybe the only books that will not be banned will be stuff like this!<br /><br />In addition, I want people to see this book!  I want them to see how bad it is.  And how much it insults everyone's intelligence.  It may, in the short term, serve the interests of a few bullies, bigots, racists and tyrants.  But in the long term, it will simply expose them for what they will have been.  And in the meantime, many decent people will read this book with an open mind and quite properly reject the nonsense it espouses.<br /><br />This book spends plenty of time talking about Jews, and it always seems to be recommending that something special be done regarding them.  For example, there are the reckless and ruthless American Jewish elites that must not be \\"coddled\\" but \\"stopped.\\"  Um, will it really help anyone to do that?  Did it help anyone when the Germans tried it?  The truth is that doing something about the Jews is not going to stop Arab aggression or Arab opposition to human rights for their neighbors.  That's something the Arabs need to work on among themselves.<br /><br />Readers of this book might well come away with an impression that Israel is some sort of huge Empire which is shortsightedly keeping masses of ordinary people at bay by refusing them entry.  In fact, the opposite is true.  Israel is more like an overpopulated Bantustan (under 11,000 square miles), with its Arab neighbors actually holding a vast Empire (of about 5.5 million square miles) in which Jews are not particularly welcome.  In the long run, if human rights are to be tolerated for all, the anti-Zionists will have to lose.<br /><br />The United Nations has come up with a bizarre set of anti-Israeli resolutions.  Any reasonable discussion of the Arab war against Israel ought to consider the arbitrariness and bias of these resolutions as a problem that needs to be faced.  But Finkelstein just boasts about them as if they make his case!  And he blames Israel for having the nerve to build a barrier to protect its citizens.  When Israel considers putting that barrier around Maale Adumim or Ariel, he's horrified, and considers it a land grab.  I think that even if it were a land grab, Israel ought to have a duty, not just a right, to do something to protect the lives of its citizens.<br /><br />The author blames unwillingness of more folks to support anti-Israeli aggression on the Jews.  In particular, he says that Jews invoke the Holocaust, which gives them immunity to criticism.  He continues with this argument by saying that the real reason people complain in a strong manner against anti-Zionism is to defend Israel.  Now, I have nothing against those who defend Israel.  But I have to reject this line for another reason.  Back in the 1940s, some folks said that those who wanted to fight Germany merely wanted to defend the Jews.  That argument was both bogus and racist then, and I think it still is.<br /><br />Finkelstein appears to have a policy of picking on a few irrelevant and minor items to label entire works as hoaxes.  Some of these items are simply typos.  Others are in fact accurate, and by starting a debate on them, Finkelstein can manage to get a discussion off track.  In any case, let's look at a couple of fundamentals.  Joan Peters wrote a book that gets the basic aspects of the Arab war against Israel right.  Finkelstein calls it a hoax.  Finkelstein says that the only possible way to justify Zionism is via some racist argument.  I say that the opposite is true, and that the only way to justify anti-Zionism is via some racist argument.  At least one of us is not only wrong, but anti-scholarly.  In my opinion, neither of us ought to have our writings banned.  But at least one of us ought to have a big Warning on what we write on the topic from some accreditor: maybe some sort of Bad Housekeeping Stamp of Disapproval (from some non-governmental organization that has to stand on its own merits).<br /><br />My big complaint with this book is not its style or its politics.  It is with its substitution of political propaganda for scholarship.  How does one complain about such a thing without appearing to be just as political?  Some folks will praise this book, and some will condemn it.  Are they all the same?  No.  I want to warn against being evenhanded.  Some say that the Earth is flat, some say it is not.  Some say that the Earth goes around the Sun, some say it does not.  Some say pi is less than 4, some say it is not.  Refusing to take a stand on such nonsense is unacceptable: it would lead to a huge loss of knowledge for our civilization.  That's the case here.<br /><br />The University of California is a very fine educational institution.  It will easily survive having its press publish many volumes such as this one.  But there is no doubt that the book is bad news.  Haim Harari, in \\"A View from the Eye of the Storm,\\" says that we all ought to say to the perpetrators of some of these anti-Zionist lies:<br /><br />\\"You are lying.

Still, one of the prices of freedom is having to put up with material of this sort.<br /><br />On the other hand, our educational institutions and their presses do not need to publish anti-scholarly stuff such as this.

After all, Israelis want and need peace.  But they can accept no substitutes.  Arabs probably want peace too.  But some of them prefer to deny human rights to Jews.  And that includes Arafat's gang of thugs.  When those folks make it to a negotiating table, nothing good comes of it.<br /><br />But let's see what the authors have to say about all this!<br /><br />William Quandt seems to exist in a fantasy world.  To him, all the negotiations so far, UN resolution 242, Madrid in 1991, the Oslo accords, the Beilin-Abu Mazen understanding, and so on, are reality.  To me, they are a big and silly joke.  And the issues they discussed: Hebron, Gaza, Jerusalem, refugees, and so forth, are to my mind minor and irrelevant.  If Arabs are willing to abide human rights for Jews, these issues will be settled easily.  If not, there will not be peace.<br /><br />Quandt speaks of \\"painful concessions.\\"  That indicates to me that he's not playing with all 52 cards.  Is peace and prosperity somehow more painful than death, destruction, and poverty?<br /><br />Omar Dajani explains that the Levantine Arabs see themselves as deserving of victory.  After all, the situation is that a giant is facing down by a dwarf (actually, I have no idea which one he thinks is the giant).  He complains that the Arabs often had no plan in the negotiations, and sometimes agreed \\"to concessions at the eleventh hour.\\"  Really!  I can assure him that I would have given his team all the time in the world, and more, to prepare a plan.  My feeling is that Dajani made some good points: the Arabs did indeed give many people the feeling that they were not serious about reaching a deal.  I know that had I been on their team, I would have wanted to reach a deal, even if I intended to break it.  And I think there it was a real problem for the Arabs to decide what they really wanted as well as to decide if they ought to ask for what they actually wanted.<br /><br />There is a strange article by Aharon Klieman.  He suspects that the West Bank is being used as little more than a bargaining chip by Israel for \\"security tangibles.\\"  That's possible, of course.  And he lists four things that bothered the Israelis about the Arab negotiators:<br /><br />1)  Arab insistence on sole victimization and full entitlement<br /><br />2)  Arab refusal to accept compromises or make counteroffers<br /><br />3)  Arab intolerance for fundamental Israeli rights and claims<br /><br />4) Arafat's demand for the \\"return\\" of Arab refugees not to a new Arab state, but to Israel, as well as Arafat's absurd claim that there was never a Jewish Temple in Jerusalem<br /><br />Still, isn't there something missing here?  Such as the constant anti-Israeli rhetoric by Arab leaders and media?  And the hate taught to Arab schoolchildren?  Klieman seems to have overlooked all this.  And we see the result when Klieman is unable to understand Barak's reaction to the failure of the Camp David talks.  Barak complained that in Arab culture, lying creates no dissonance.  \\"Truth is seen as an irrelevant category.  There is only that which serves your purpose and that which doesn't.  They see themselves as emissaries of a national movement for whom everything is permissible.  There is no such thing as `the truth.'\\"  Klieman wonders why Barak would say such a thing.  I'm not wondering at all: he observed the Arab negotiators doing just this and he didn't like it.  He was frustrated with all the lies.  Klieman must be blind not to realize this.  And it is outrageous for Klieman to find fault with what Barak said without even discussing how accurately it might apply to the Arab negotiators.<br /><br />Tamara Wittes talks about a \\"clash of worldviews\\" between Arafat and Barak.  I think she's right about this.  I think we're not talking about a disagreement over facts.  I think we're talking about a more fundamental issue.  And I think Arafat was a racist whobelieved that Arabs had a Divine Right to oppress non-Arabs in general and Jews in particular, while  Barak believed that Arabs and Jews ought to treat each other as fellow humans with equal rights.  Of course, that's not quite what Wittes means.  She seems to think of Arafat as wanting to focus on \\"justice,\\" although I must admit that she did use the more accurate term \\"pan-Arab issues.\\"  And of Barak as wanting to focus on security issues.<br /><br />I claim that the reason there was no peace was that the Arabs refused it.  But why was there no piece of paper?  I have to admit that I expected at least an agreement, even if the \\"peace\\" it produced lasted for only a few microseconds.  Wittes offers three explanations:<br /><br />1) It was just too hard; the gap between the two sides was too great on issues such as the Old City of Jerusalem or Arab refugees<br /><br />2) The personalities of the participants was too much of a problem<br /><br />3) There was a failure to communicate<br /><br />Well, that's enough for this book.  I'd prefer a more stimulating and academic topic.  I think even a tome about the number of angels that can dance on a microdot would be more enlightening.nk Arafat was a racist who believed that Arabs had a Divine Right to oppress non-Arabs in general and Jews in particular, while  Barak believed that Arabs and Jews ought to treat each other as fellow humans with equal rights.

I've read plenty of books about Israel.  Some say Israel is right to defend the lives, liberty, and property of its citizens.  Some say it isn't.  But until now, every one of them has given some semblance of a justification for its stance.  This book is an exception.  It simply takes it as a given that Israel is Wrong with a capital W.  It was Wrong for it to incur the wrath of the Arabs.  It was Wrong to build illegal homes on Sacred Arab Land.  For Adam and Moodley, it is not necessary to give some bogus history of the Middle East to defend such a conclusion.  To them, it is simply Truth.  To me, it is simply a Lie that can be stated in ten seconds but takes years of work to expose.  That's one of the powers of lies: they destroy in seconds what civilization has taken years to build up.<br /><br />The authors pretend to be reasonable.  They are nothing of the sort.  They boast about having talked to all sorts of Jews and Arabs.  But they have learned nothing from them.  They repeat some of the arguments they have heard.  But they do not understand them at all.  They sympathize with those who are being hurt on both sides of the conflict, without once doubting that the Israelis are Wrong.<br /><br />It never occurs to the authors that in a just world, in peacetime, the Israeli Jews would simply buy up 20,000 or 40,000 or 60,000 square miles in the Middle East and make it bloom, improving the economy of the area.  And that no one would challenge the ability of Israel to stand on its own feet, treat its own citizens properly, or hold on to its own land.  It is beyond their imagination to picture, as I do, Israel as a Bantustan, with racist Arabs refusing to let Jews pollute neighboring nations by buying homes and living there.<br /><br />Nor, in their closed-mindedness, do the authors realize that many rational people see Israel as being entitled to its land.  Instead, they imply that the only people who could think such thoughts are closed-minded zealots who are \\"beyond rational persuasion.\\"<br /><br />When antizionists shout down Zionist speakers on campuses, the authors complain that opposing such bullying would \\"ban all discussions\\" and shirk \\"rational, analytic debate where it should be encouraged.\\"  They insist that the logic of Zionism requires that Arabs be second-class citizens in Israel, if not completely expelled.  That's nonsense, of course.  Zionism is simply human rights, and what they say is its opposite.<br /><br />The authors come up with contradictory arguments about demography, saying that Jews can't be a majority in little Israel but then dismissing the idea that an Arab \\"right of return to Israel would threaten its Jewish majority!<br /><br />The authors discuss the idea of shaming people into acting morally.  I wonder if the National Socialists in the early 1940s could have shamed the Slavs, Jews, Roma, and others into killing themselves.  Somehow, I doubt it.  Moreover, I even more strongly doubt that such actions would have been moral.<br /><br />The authors regard Israel as a fluke of nature, created by pogroms, slaughters, and so on.  It does not occur to them that Jews were going to flock to the Levant as soon as it became possible for them to do so: emancipation as the cause of Israel just escapes them.<br /><br />The authors say that there are good and bad things about Zionism.  And that \\"Zionism\\" ought not be a term of opprobrium!  But I wonder what the good things might be when simply acquiring land is considered by them to be an act of displacing Arabs!<br /><br />I have never seen the case in favor of terrorism made so loudly internationally as it has been for Yasir Arafat and his gang of thugs.  But the authors complain that their case is represented poorly in the Western media!<br /><br />Adam and Moodley argue in favor of a Truth (and Reconciliation) Commission.  I strongly agree.  I think they display their closed-mindedness by not even dreaming of what it might discover.  They are right that it would find that some Arabs were expelled from their homes in 1948.  It might discover plenty about what the Arabs did to the Jews, of course, but I wonder if they realize just what this might mean.  They do say that it would find that there was indeed a Jewish Temple in Jerusalem long ago.  Good for them.  But there is so much more.  And, oh yes, they even say that being Christian is not necessary for reconciliation.  As a Pagan, I'm glad to learn that!<br /><br />The authors display shock that anyone with liberal credentials could support the Israeli fence which had to be put in place to defend the lives of Israelis against suicide bombers.  They wonder how 83% (of Israeli Jews, presumably) can support defending the lives of their fellow Jewish citizens, even those who live in Ariel or Maale Adumim.  I, in turn, wonder how Adam and Moodley can deny that Israel has a duty to defend those lives, and I would feel the same way even if I thought that Israel ought to cede Ariel and Maale Adumim to the Arabs.<br /><br />If the Levantine Arabs had been represented by Mandela, not Arafat, would there have been peace?  I have no idea.  But I'm sure that having a thug like Arafat lead the Arabs precluded peace.  The authors say that even Mandela could not have brought peace.  And they conclude that Israel is unwilling to have peace while the Arabs lack the capacity to achieve it.  This conclusion is total nonsense.  If enough people believe it, maybe we'll avoid peace for a very long time.<br /><br />This book is simply awful.ed-mindedness by not even dreaming of what it might discover.

And they conclude that Israel is unwilling to have peace while the Arabs lack the capacity to achieve it.  This conclusion is total nonsense.  If enough people believe it, maybe we'll avoid peace for a very long time. <br /> <br />This book is simply awful. <br />	2005-08-30

And Jordan Paper makes some good points about polytheism and the ways in which it is superior to monotheism.<br /><br />The author begins by explaining what he means by \\"theology.\\"  Theology to him can mean \\"to theorize from within a particular tradition.\\"  But that does not suffice to define the term to me.<br /><br />We find out that the Goddesses and Gods are fairly diverse.  My favorites are the perfections of attributes (such as strength, honesty, wisdom, cooperation, adventure, and so on).  But others are simply representatives of non-humans (such as trees, earth, sky, or the entire planet).  And some are specific to given locales, so that your Goddess may have no jurisdiction over the valley on the other side of the mountain where your neighbors live.<br /><br />The author discusses many of the North American and Chinese Deities and explains their natures as well as how they are hailed.  There are sections on ancestral spirits, and divine ghosts.<br /><br />Paper explains that polytheism is natural to humans.  And that the Gods and Goddesses tend to be hailed or adored, not feared.  While the term \\"worshipper\\" may be appropriate for many monotheists, the more common term for polytheists is \\"devotee.\\" Paper explains that the polytheistic deities \\"tend to be more companionable than a single, absolute, monarchial deity.\\"<br /><br />The author explains that for polytheists, there is no concept of \\"heresy.\\"  There simply is no single religious dogma to be denied.  That's not true for monotheists, who often confuse their dogmas with empirical truths.  And that can lead to a very destructive fanaticism among monotheists.  In addition, we can see that the major monotheistic religions tend to favor Men over Women, and can favor one race over another as well.<br /><br />In my opinion, we humans are varied and fickle and thus need to worship a big bunch of Goddesses and Gods.  And Paper seems to imply this as well: he points out that if our prayers to one deity are not answered, it is normal to consider switching to some other deity.<br /><br />One obvious aspect of modern monotheism is its stultifying authoritarianism.  And Paper does explain that polytheism is useful, enjoyable, and exhilarating.  Still, I would have appreciated more of a discussion about the lack of authoritarianism in some forms of polytheism.<br /><br />Since Paper does discuss the problems of monotheism in leading us humans into conflict, I was hoping he would draw some conclusions about the future of polytheism.  One possibility is that the future will be much like the past: the polytheistic religions that correspond to the human spirit will be defeated by a few monotheists at gunpoint.  But I think it is more likely that such impositions of the religions of others will eventually be rejected by society, that we'll return to the Gods and Goddesses, and that They will return to us.ddesses and Gods.

Well, it ought to be.  There is much that we can learn about our world from history.  If we know plenty of facts about events that happened in the past, we can reach conclusions about why they happened.  We can deduce a few things that we otherwise could not have known.  And we may even be able to make better predictions about the future.<br /><br />As Windschuttle points out, history is more than mere science; it is also literature.  And since stories can be told from many different points of view, there is always a risk of giving too much credence to historical theories that are at odds with the facts.  In addition, history can have political uses, so there can be even greater incentive to be inaccurate.<br /><br />Still, the author's main targets are a few relatively new literary and social theories that have served as a justification for some poor scholarship in the field of history.  He includes cultural relativism, semiotics, structuralism, post-structuralism, anti-humanism, Marxism, postmodernism, radical skepticism, and hermeneutics.  There's also a discussion of historical fiction and poetics.  The unifying theme is the rejection of historical scholarship by these theories.  As one of those who find history fascinating and useful, I have to side with Windschuttle here.<br /><br />In this book, the author gives a number of specific examples of genuine historical work.  Major topics include the European conquest of Mexico, the death of James Cook, the mutiny on the Bounty, and the European settlement of Australia.<br /><br />Of course, the main question about the conquest of Mexico is how a small number of Spaniards managed to do it.  And the author explains that answer is easy: the Aztecs were notorious for their cruelty and had made numerous enemies; the Spaniards allied themselves with these natives.  In addition, the Spaniards had great military strength, as well as enormous knowledge of the tactics of siege warfare.  While Aztec culture was not irrelevant to what happened, it was not the main reason why the Aztecs lost.<br /><br />In the case of Cook, one simple question arises: was Cook regarded by the Hawaiians as a god (Lono) or simply a chief (to be treated with respect by non-chiefs)?  Windschuttle shows that logic and facts point to the latter conclusion.<br /><br />The author, quite properly, affirms the value of the \\"Western\\" scientific method.  And he deplores the tribalism that would have us ignore it.<br /><br />I have long been intrigued by the fact that some foes of genuine historical research, such as Ed Said, have been propagandists for causes that have much to fear from truth.  In my opinion, such propagandists use \\"history\\" to make some truly outrageous and inconsistent arguments, such as that people who have been oppressed in the past ought to be oppressed in the future (or given breaks in the future), or that people who have lived on land in the past ought to be denied the right to live there in the future (or given special rights to it in the future).  This book helped me see how some of the attacks on empirical reality fit into the realm of propaganda.t to what happened, it was not the main reason why the Aztecs lost.

One would think that American universities would be centers of free speech, where all sorts of views could be stated freely.  Well, that hasn't been entirely the case recently.  And this book examines some of the problems that have arisen.<br /><br />I would have thought that the fundamental issues would be simple.  Most speech is inoffensive.  Some speech is actually illegal (sedition, incitement, or whatever).  The line between illegal speech and legal speech may be a subject of debate, but that line exists somewhere.  And some speech is in between: it is offensive but not illegal.  And those who are offended have plenty of options: they can shun such people, or tell others about their bad manners, and so forth.<br /><br />As this book points out, once one has rules against offensive speech, not just against intimidation (or worse), that leads to thought control.  And there are some examples of what has been happening along these lines.<br /><br />One spectacular example is the 1993 \\"water buffalo\\" case at the University of Pennsylvania.  A Penn freshman got in trouble for using the term \\"water buffalo\\" in response to students who were making too much noise at midnight outside his dormitory.  Although a simple apology from him would have been the most reasonable resolution, Penn made this into a major case.  So did much of the nation!  The result was not only a victory for the accused student, but the removal of the \\"speech codes\\" at Penn.  It seems that the speech codes were doomed by the idiotic claims of Penn officials, including the Penn President, that they were merely following due process in the water buffalo case.<br /><br />Downs describes how speech codes were removed at the University of Wisconsin as well.  And there is some fascinating material about the University of California, Berkeley.  The campus newspaper ran an ad that offended some people, and then compounded the problem by apologizing for it (offending even more folks).  And then, there was a speech by well-known conservative David Horowitz.  An assistant chancellor warned Horowitz that he might be shouted down \\"because the right of free expression also\\" belonged to those that disagreed with him!  I find it incredible that such censorship could be called \\"free expression.\\"  Others were similarly censored just for having \\"politically incorrect\\" views.  A striking example was former Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was prevented from speaking to 2000 waiting ticket holders by a couple of hundred foes of free speech.  One of these people, when challenged about what she had done replied that she didn't \\"believe in free speech for war criminals.\\"  By the way, given Netanyahu's record, I find such a charge against him ludicrous.  And I wonder if genuine criminals, such as Yasir Arafat, would have been shouted down at Berkeley.<br /><br />One more topic in the book is the sexual misconduct policy at Columbia University.  That's another university that has a problem with taking political correctness too seriously.  But in this case, the issue was simply that people accused of sexual misconduct were denied due process, including the right to hear the testimony against them or to cross-examine.  That policy eventually had to be scrapped.  Still, the incident serves to show the moral blindness of some of those who create policies on campus.<br /><br />I found this book very interesting and I strongly recommend it.ive David Horowitz.

And I expected this to be Falk's concern as well, whether we agreed about details or not.<br /><br />Falk discusses what he calls the Westphalian model of order, involving states of varying shapes and sizes that more or less protect the rights and interests of their citizens and other residents.  And then he gets to regionalism, in which groups of states can work together for their mutual benefit and protection.  Of course, some states do not work well to benefit their citizens.  I might add that there are a few cases in which regions may gang up on a member rather than protect it.  Should there be strong global organizations that can help remedy this?  Or would such organizations, if given the power to do so, just make matters worse?<br /><br />I think the track record of the United Nations is so bad that we need to concentrate on avoiding the possibility of a global tyranny.  Falk, on the other hand, feels that states are losing power as well as becoming greater threats to world order, so a strong global government is not a bad idea.  The author admits that the UN failed strikingly to protect human rights in Rwanda and elsewhere, but he tends to blame such failures on the West.<br /><br />There is plenty more in this book, and I don't have the space to discuss it all, but I will comment on Falk's support for an International Criminal Court.  Falk precedes this with some reasonable material about war crimes trials and reparations in the twentieth centuries.  And he notes that some of the courts used in these trials may have been ad hoc, and that it would be good to standardize such justice worldwide.  Well, I strongly disagree.  One concern I have about an International Criminal Court is that I feel it would arbitrarily side with aggressors on many occasions.  One specific example I would pick is the attack on Jewish rights in the Middle East.  And Falk immediately discusses this issue!  However, he does not reassure me; he merely confirms my fears about all this.<br /><br />The author insists that the frustration of Levantine Arab \\"rights\\" to \\"self-determination\\" has been seen by many \\"as the most vivid expression of double standards in international life, thereby undermining respect for international law and the UN.\\"  Well, I think there is indeed a huge double standard, but in the opposite direction.  Land-poor Israel is deemed greedy for having less than 11,000 square miles for its 6 million people, 5 million of whom are Jews.  It is asked to cede land to a vast Arab Empire.  And it is asked to allow anti-Israeli Arabs to move to what land it gets to keep (as citizens, no less!).  Meanwhile, its Arab neighbors are not chided for pretty much banning Jews, loyal or otherwise, as citizens and homeowners.  What we're seeing is not a demand for Arab rights at all, but opposition to Jewish rights specifically and human rights in general.  International courts ought to be ruling against the theft of land from the land-poor for the purpose of giving such land to the land-rich.  If they instead make it a major goal of theirs to rule in favor of such theft, I think they are counterproductive.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book.trials may have been ad hoc, and that it would be good to standardize such justice worldwide.

But that does not stop him from misleading his readers in this piece of propaganda.<br /><br />This book does have some really interesting material in it.  Some of it is about Masada.  Here, the author complains that the traditional Masada story is pretty far off.  I tend to agree with much of what Gelvin says here.  But I also feel that Gelvin is wrong to imply that Masada is being used as an excuse by Jews for the policies of Israel.  I think Israeli policies are typically driven by a desire of Israel to protect the rights of its citizens.<br /><br />The author discusses Golda Meir's comments about the Levantine Arab nation not having existed prior to 1967.  Gelvin and I disagree here: he says that Meir's claim was absurd, while I say it was accurate.  As a matter of fact, I think the Levantine Arabs still do not behave like a nation.  They do not ask for rights for themselves.  They do not ask for land.  They ask only for less rights for Jews.  They are more like the Sudeten Germans, who did not ask for independence, but merely for an end to Czech independence.  Or the Ku Klux Klan, which does not ask for freedom for Whites, but an end to freedom for Blacks.<br /><br />Gelvin spends some time discussing the Levantine Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair.  This exhibit looked like an idealized Jewish \\"tower and stockade\\" construction.  And I found the whole section quite interesting.  But I was shocked that Gelvin did not appear to take a strong stand against the way the British were treating the Jews at the time.  As I see it, the British White Paper of 1939 was one of the most obviously evil acts of a rather wicked twentieth century.  I can't imagine why anyone would want to appear to be neutral about it.  But Gelvin implies that the Jews should have been more moderate, at a time when we can all see that moderation was totally unsuccessful in preventing a truly huge disaster in which millions of Jews were murdered.  That's quite a view to take.<br /><br />Just to make sure that we readers can be sure where Gelvin stands, he then whitewashes the \\"poetry\\" of racist thugs such as Mahmoud Darwish.  And he casually mentions that the Jews took land that belonged to the Arabs.  But wait a second.  Does all land belong to the Arabs?  Even land that wasn't Arab before, or was sold by the Arabs to others?  Gelvin is misleading his readers quite badly here by implying that all of the Levant was (and is) rightfully Arab land.  And he has to know better than that.<br /><br />In my opinion, if the Arabs want peace, they can have it in five minutes, just by calling off their war and abiding Jewish rights in the region.  I suspect the Jews truly want peace, even one that may not be totally fair to them.  But it doesn't matter: the Jews would have no choice but to accept such a peace, since they need peace to survive and prosper.<br /><br />I think we need some scholarly works on the Arab war against Israel, rather than all the propaganda we see.

I liked it, even though I often disagreed with it.  It argues for a two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.  But this book makes a better case against the enemies of peace than it does in favor of any specific solution.  And indeed, if the people in the region want peace, they'll achieve it and it will benefit them.  But that will entail, in my opinion, a big change in Arab attitudes.<br /><br />Late in the book, Dershowitz makes an excellent point.  Namely, that, perhaps in response to his own book called \\"The Case for Israel,\\" Michael Neumann has written a book called \\"The Case Against Israel.\\"  Um, why not \\"The Case for the Arabs?\\"  I think this shows part of the problem: many of those who are against Israel are not really for anyone.<br /><br />Dershowitz realizes that many Arabs want to be rewarded, not punished, for their campaign of terrorism.  And he knows that some actions he recommends may be seen as impractical appeasement of terrorism.  He's willing to state some of the objections to what he says.  And he then makes his points clearly and fairly.<br /><br />The author notes that some people, including some Jews, say that the existence of Israel is bad for the Jews.  Well, they might want to ask some of the Jews from Russia, Ethiopia, Argentina, and elsewhere who have found Israel to be a very useful haven!<br /><br />There is a discussion of the failure of the Camp David talks.  Dershowitz explains that although some people claim that the Arabs were offered only a disjointed and non-contiguous area in the West Bank, the truth is that they were offered a completely contiguous region there, and he shows maps to illustrate this.  And he disposes of claims that peace would somehow infringe upon the rights of individuals or groups in the region.<br /><br />The author says that Jerusalem can be shared in order to achieve peace.  I disagree.  It may indeed be shared, but I think this idea is too clever by half.  I suspect it is likely to be a waste of time to spend so much effort to split up Jerusalem, inch by inch, when such agreements may last only hours before being replaced by something which changes the border by miles.  If the people on both sides really want to split Jerusalem in this weird and awkward manner, they'll choose it.  If not, I think it may be a bad idea anyway.<br /><br />Dershowitz notes that suicide bombers, along with the hate speech and other incitement that helps produce them, are serious threats to peace.  And that a new Levantine Arab state that launched terrorist attacks on Israel would also threaten peace.  He also explains why the touted \\"Geneva Accords\\" won't work.<br /><br />Well, what about having an international court help out?  Dershowitz replies that the International Court of Justice is much like Mississippi courts in the 1930s.  Just as these Mississippi courts, which excluded Blacks, could not judge fairly when issues involved disputes between Blacks and Whites, the International Court of Justice can't judge fairly when issues involve Israel.  Nor can the United Nations.<br /><br />The author argues in favor of having a demilitarized Levantine Arab state.  I think this is a bad idea, and that the entire purpose of such a state would be to militarize and attack Israel.<br /><br />Now, what about those who are on the sidelines, off in America or Europe?  And not in the  Middle East at all?  Dershowitz shows us that many professors are so extreme in their demands for war that even if Israel could make peace with the Arabs, it would have no chance of making peace with these academics (especially with some of the professors at Columbia University, in New York City).  Some of these scholars compare Israel with Germany of the 1930s and 1940s.  Or with South African apartheid.  But the author shows that such comparisons are not mere opinions, but wild falsehoods.  And he also shows that there are some media folks with similar problems.<br /><br />One frequent charge made by anti-Zionists is that any criticism of Israel is called anti-Semitic.  Dershowitz carefully explains that this charge is false, and includes nice checklists that show the differences between legitimate criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism.<br /><br />But what about supporters of Israel who make stronger demands than Israel does itself?  Dershowitz implies that this is going too far.  But I disagree.  I think a stand has to be judged on its merits, not on how unusual it is.  Israeli Jews may be pressured into violating the rights of Arabs.  They may be pressured into violating their own rights.  I see absolutely no reason why I and others shouldn't criticize them, or simply disagree with them, if they do so.<br /><br />Near the end of the book, Dershowitz takes on a trio of anti-Israeli writers: Noam Chomsky, Norman Finkelstein, and Alexander Cockburn.  Chomsky is a very bright individual who has made many scholarly contributions to society, but as Dershowitz shows, Chomsky is also a very strong opponent of Jewish rights in the Levant.  Finkelstein is a little different.  He's not much of a scholar, and is a terrific example of one who has substituted political propaganda for scholarly work.  As the author tells us, Finkelstein has criticized Joan Peters' book, \\"From Time Immemorial.\\"  And that some of Peters' data about Arab immigration and in-migration may be a little off, and some of her interpretations of these data may be inaccurate.  Still, most of her book has nothing to do with any of this.  And even in the part that is affected, others have shown that her most basic conclusions are valid.  But Finkelstein has gone overboard, and called her whole work a \\"hoax\\" based on such minor points!<br /><br />This is a fine book, and I recommend it to everyone.cism of Israel is called anti-Semitic.

Yes, some of us can remember the generation in Germany that stood up to those Jews, Czechs, and others.  But we can also remember that this generation accomplished little of value.  And that win or lose, they wouldn't have improved the quality of life for many folks.  Now there is a generation of Arabs that is willing to stand up to the Jews.  And maybe to others as well.  And once again, I can't see how this attitude is going to help anyone, win or lose.<br /><br />While this book purports to see the Arab war against Israel from both sides, it basically faults Israel for not recognizing the suffering of the Arabs.  And I think this misses the point.  Even if the charges made against Israel were true, I think Israeli confessions would do little to make life better for Arabs.<br /><br />The authors seem to praise (and boast about) racist Arab aggression against Israel.  And they say that sympathy for the Jews after World War Two is responsible for Israel's existence.  They thus imply that Israel's very right to exist is dubious.  But they do not point out that had there been no second World War (or at least, no slaughter of millions of Jewish civilians), Israel would still exist, and be quite a bit stronger (and very likely larger).<br /><br />The authors dismiss the Six Day War as only having a price of seven hundred Israeli dead.  Well, they are right about the casualty figures.  They are some of the lowest in Jewish history.  They might want to look at Jewish casualties at other times when Jews were attacked in the past few centuries.  Do you suppose the authors would be so dismissive of an Arab victory if there were relatively few Arab casualties?<br /><br />Rabinowitz and Abu-Baker say that Israelis are too self-righteous.  But even if they are, shouldn't the authors worry about the Arabs too?  Doesn't it matter how much Arabs value truth, justice, human rights, peace, or prosperity?  Or, for that matter, their own Arab Empire?<br /><br />It seems to me that if the authors get their way, Israel will become just one more Arab state that discriminates against non-Muslims.  That's nothing to cheer about.e that if the authors get their way, Israel will become just one more Arab state that discriminates against non-Muslims.  That's nothing to cheer about.	2005-08-20

And while it makes some valid points, most of them are trivial.  And others are simply wrong.<br /><br />Halliday excuses Arab violence on the grounds that other people are violent too!  However, I think that we ought to oppose crime no matter who engages in it.<br /><br />In any case, Halliday has 100 points to make.  And in point (8) he implies that Arab hostility to Israel is not a continuation of prior Arab persecution of Jews.  I have to disagree with him here.<br /><br />In point (38), Halliday tries to get us to think that Islamic states allow for separation of religion and state.  But this is totally misleading.  In point (61), the author implies that the oil weapon did not help the Arabs in their war against Israel.  I wonder about that.  I wonder just how eager everyone would have been to applaud a terrorist thug such as Arafat at the United Nations had the Arabs been without oil.  Plenty of anti-Israeli propaganda is backed by Arab oil money.<br /><br />Halliday also says that Israel is basically \\"just another corrupt Southern Mediterranean country.\\"  And not, say, a light unto nations.  I disagree.  Israel has accomplished a great deal in less than 60 years.  It has been a haven for oppressed Jews.  And it has thrived un spite of all the attacks on it.  I find the whole story inspiring.  Halliday is right about Israel being a Mediterranean country, of course.  Perhaps he could tell those folks in the rest of the Mediterranean countries, so that they might think about inviting it to the Mediterranean Games!<br /><br />And oh yes, the author tells us that Israel is a colonial state which is occupying the lands of others!  I wonder why Israel had to fight against the British for its independence if it were simply a colonial state.  And I wonder why it is that when Jews far outbid others for land and pay high prices as a result, folks like Halliday imply that it is the \\"occupation\\" of the lands of others!  Well, no matter why Halliday does it, he's wrong.<br /><br />I'm not sure why there's so much nonsense of this sort in print.  I'd have guessed that if oil money is the reason, it would have produced better material than this.  Maybe if we avoid buying books such as this one, folks will still produce them.  But I think we ought to try avoiding this book and see what happens.tter why Halliday does it, he's wrong. <br /> <br />I'm not sure why there's so much nonsense of this sort in print.

In the decade prior to 1948, hundreds of thousands (perhaps millions) of Jewish lives would have been saved had Israel existed.  They would have moved to Israel much as Jews actually did in 1948 and the next few years.  In those days, Jews reached Israel from Europe, Yemen and elsewhere.  But not too many showed up from Ethiopia.  And this book begins by explaining why.<br /><br />One complication is that the Ethiopian Jews are not genetically related to the Ashkenazic (German) or Sephardic (Spanish) Jews.  Does that mean that they are not really Jews?  Well, that's up to Israel and some of its rabbis and other leaders to decide.  They certainly look like Jews to me, but I'm a Pagan, and my opinion isn't relevant.  On the other hand, they also look like Jews to some Israelis rabbis whose opinion is relevant.  And it seems that there may well be a third branch of Jews, in addition to the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim.<br /><br />When Golda Meir was the Prime Minister of Israel, she showed little interest in bringing the Ethiopians to Israel, in part because she feared that it would endanger Israeli relations with Ethiopia and other African nations.  But Menachim Begin felt that Israel's claim to be a Zionist state would be sabotaged unless it could bring Ethiopian Jews into the country.  As for the Ethiopian Jews, most of them not only wanted to immigrate to Israel but were willing to risk their lives to do so.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after the Yom Kippur War, most African nations, including Ethiopia, broke diplomatic relations with Israel.<br /><br />That's where this book starts, and it continues by describing the rescue of Ethiopian Jews, over 94,000 of whom now live in Israel.  The most exciting part is about the airlift of over 14,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in May, 1991 (Operation Solomon).  It happened quickly.  The first plane left Addis Ababa at 1:30 PM on May 24, and the final one, less than a day later, at 11:35 AM on May 25, with the planes crossing the Red Sea, of course.<br /><br />I found the book very exciting, as it described the wars and revolutions that confronted everyone in the region, as well as the various bribes that people had to pay to try to free the Ethiopian Jews.  And I feel it has a moral: the oppressed can indeed be liberated, and people will show courage and strength to help liberate themselves and to liberate others.M on May 25, with the planes crossing the Red Sea, of course.

Should we ignore them?  Or support them?  Of course not.  America is being attacked by a real enemy.  That enemy means business.  And it is a good idea for us to defend ourselves.  On the other hand, we ought not take action against loyal American citizens, whether Muslim or non-Muslim.  We need to separate the sheep from the goats.  And I think this otherwise excellent book does not do an adequate job of making that separation.<br /><br />One of the primary things that makes America great is our people.  And a main reason why we have such good people is that we attract them from all over the world.  We do not want to be discouraging Muslims from coming here.  And we don't want to be encouraging them to emigrate.  I think we need to be careful not to needlessly restrict Muslim freedom to travel, wear burqas, eat halal food, or worship.  But as this book explains, we still need to defend ourselves from those who are taking advantage of the opportunities a free society has to offer and using them to launch violent attacks on us.<br /><br />In this book, Sperry shows that the spreading of some \\"politically correct\\" untruths about Islam has in fact been funded by Arabs who have anything but America's best interests at heart.  And there is an example of a prominent pro-Islamic American professor who has a wealthy Arab benefactor from the Middle East.  In addition, a prominent Muslim organization, CAIR, seems to have a number of links to pro-terrorist funds.  It isn't clear just where the line between \\"sheep\\" and \\"goat\\" needs to be drawn, but I think these examples make it clear that it has to be drawn somewhere.<br /><br />Sperry has some recommendations.  I think some may go too far, while others may not go far enough in both addressing the problem of Muslim terrorism while not chasing away loyal American Muslims.  Here they are.<br /><br />1)  Schools which teach hatred should enjoy no tax breaks and no government support.  I agree.<br /><br />2)  The U.S. should enforce the oath of allegiance.  I think this is reasonable as well.<br /><br />3)  Profile Muslim travellers.  That's a good idea, but I'm worried about overly restricting freedom of travel.<br /><br />4)  Audit Muslim \\"charities.\\"  Unfortunately, some of this needs to be done, given their track record.<br /><br />5)  Break off official ties with CAIR.  I agree.<br /><br />6)  Expose the Saudi embassy.<br /><br />7)  Deny security clearances to Muslim activists.  Actually, I think this goes over the \\"sheep-goat\\" line.  It makes the same people into both.<br /><br />8)  Offer scholarships in Arabic.<br /><br />9)  Fight Muslim activism in public schools.  Again, I think this has to be thought about more carefully.<br /><br />10)  Improve counterterrorism organizations.  By the way, Sperry mentions that Jewish Arabic-speakers are routinely turned down for counterterrorism jobs.  I agree that this is an error.<br /><br />Sperry points out that communities can refuse to allow Muslim schools or mosques to be built.  I think this is a bad idea.  These schools and mosques will (and should) be built anyway.  What communities need to do is enforce laws against incitement to violence or sedition.  In fact, I would look carefully at the material taught in government-funded schools and reported on government-funded radio and television stations.  I think there is no need to fund the teaching or reporting of pro-terrorist lies with government money.<br /><br />All in all, I think there is plenty of very useful material in this book and I recommend it.nt support.

And here, Peters distinguishes between \\"practical\\" terrorists and \\"apocalyptic\\" terrorists.  I think this is a useful concept.  After all, some terrorists clearly want to make some changes, often positive (at least for themeselves) in the here and now.  Such people don't want to die, even if they are willing to take big risks relatively fearlessly.  And they probably would be hesitant to use certain weapons of mass destruction: they would rather rule cities than vaporize them.  On the other hand, apocalyptic terrorists often have destruction (and even death) as a goal.<br /><br />Peters points out that Muslim support for the 9/11 attacks is symptomatic of a big problem with modern Islam.  And that many Arabs appear to be fighting not against the real Israel or the real America, but against some mythical and demonic construct which they call \\"America\\" or \\"Israel.\\"  This is, in the author's opinion, the main obstacle to peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict.<br /><br />Peters has plenty of advice to give America in our war against terror.  Some of it seems quite appropriate: Be feared.  Identify and know your enemy.  Don't fear your own power.  Speak bluntly.  Don't engage in public dialog with terrorists.  A dead terrorist is less of a martyr than an imprisoned one (sounds a little Machiavellian to me).  Strike against what terrorists hold dear.  Don't offer sanctuary to terrorists.  Be implacable when dealing with terrorists.  Do not declare victory.<br /><br />But the author has many other points to make.  One is that while America's successes have come from an embrace of the future, our diplomats seem stuck in a love with the past.<br /><br />One very important point that Peters makes is that borders have a way of changing.  Yet we pretend that recent borders are \\"permanent\\" and inviolate.  And many of us do so with the conviction of religious fanatics.  But it is all nonsense.  We need to accept the fact that demographics change, as do borders.  Peters even wants us to accept the fact that we may need to put up with ethnic cleansing, and try to accomodate it.  I can't agree with that, but I understand his point, namely that managed change is better than explosive change.<br /><br />The author also mentions that if we truly need to fight a war, we Americans will accept casualties.  We'll have to if we want to win.<br /><br />I think it's a good idea for all of us to read this book and consider the points it makes.nt\\" and inviolate.

How would I like to see a politically incorrect guide to Paganism?  Or even to Christianity, Buddhism or Judaism?  There are plenty of negative things one could say.  And some of them are indeed politically incorrect, even in today's society.  How would I like to be a Muslim and see my religion blasted away at like this?  What would my Muslim ancestors have thought of this book?<br /><br />For me, the key question is whether this book adds or subtracts to our understanding of Islam today.  And I think it adds to it, although I think it could have done a better job of it by being less one-sided.<br /><br />Spencer reminds us that Mohammed was a military leader and that he advocated war against non-Muslims.  Moreover, Islam today appears to be acting in a similar manner, with its leaders often advocating war.  The author says that it is a PC myth that \\"Islam is a religion of peace that has been hijacked by a few extremists.\\"  As Spencer says, there are some moderate Muslims who don't regard Islam as a religion of war.  But I think Spencer is making a good point here: nothing inherent in Islam is stopping Muslims from trying to convert or rule the whole world by force.<br /><br />There is a section on the Crusades which I do not entirely agree with.  But I think it makes the point that Islam was not just an innocent victim but an aggressor in much of this period.  And that in any case, there is no need for Christians to make additional and unilateral concessions to Islam on the basis of Crusades of long ago, especially when there are more recent jihads by the Muslims.<br /><br />This book is at its best when it points out that Islam has been (and still is) a religion of intolerance that oppresses women.  And that Islam clearly opposes what most of us would regard as human rights for all.  Spencer reminds us of Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which gives every human the right to freedom of thought, including the right to change his (or her) religion or belief.  Islam does not share this view.<br /><br />Now, what is to be done?  I think we need to separate the sheep from the goats here.  Those people who can't abide human rights for their neighbors are a problem.  They'll have to obey the laws of the nations they live in.  But let's see what Spencer's advice is.  And let's also see if it is Islamophobic.  Does it make unreasonable demands on Muslims, or attack law-abiding people as well as criminals?<br /><br />Well, no.  Spencer does want us to tell the truth about Muslim organizations in the United States.  Truth is always a good idea, and it certainly fits right in with separating the sheep from the goats.  He wants us to tie global foreign aid to Muslim countries to their treatment of non-Muslims.  That is certainly fair. He wants us to reconfigure our global alliances and friendships the same way: those who support jihad won't be our allies.  And we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, a smart idea no matter who controls it.<br /><br />I feel that Spencer's recommendations are reasonable.  I think they would make life easier, not harder, for all Americans, including American Muslims.  And they would make it easier for us to isolate our enemies and discourage people from joining with them.or her) religion or belief.  Islam does not share this view.    Now, what is to be done?

That includes the economic status, religious attitudes, and politics of the terrorists, of those who send them to their deaths, and to their supporters in the public at large.  And there's quite a bit about the goals of some of the terrorists, as well as how terrorism has been working: it provokes concessions.<br /><br />Well, what is to be done about all this terrorism?  Obviously, at some point, terrorism will cause an unacceptable amount of destruction.  Society will need to do something about it or fall apart.  But what?  As I see it, there are four main ideas, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive.<br /><br />The first is to defeat terror militarily.  I think that can be done.  The author is very suspicious of such an idea, calling it \\"fatally flawed.\\"  And I admit that it may take plenty of troops, and plenty of determination.  It may also require an ability to convince most folks that you mean business, and that those who support the terrorists will suffer some real consequences.  But I think that military defeats against terrorism are a symptom of a larger problem, rather than a cause of such problems.  In short, I think that no matter how terrorism is defeated, force will need to be used at some point, and used successfully.  I feel that Pape could have done a better job of discussing this topic.<br /><br />A second idea is \\"democracy.\\"  The idea is that people as a whole will refuse to support arbitrary terror against a foe that wants peace in the first place.  Pape is suspicious of this as well, and so am I.  One problem is that democracy and freedom can be like releasing a slingshot.  One builds up energy by indoctrinating one's people, undemocratically.  And then one suddenly installs \\"democracy,\\" releasing the population when a huge majority of them may still be intent on aggression and destruction.  Releasing a loaded slingshot represents violence to me.  The proper method is to put the slingshot down nicely.  That means having a democracy in which people have had a chance to become more diverse politically.<br /><br />One idea that I feel Pape ought to have spent more time on is truth.  Those who value truth are less likely to engage in irrational and destructive behavior.  Oh, but didn't Pape just explain that terrorism is rational?  That it works?  That it produces concessions?<br /><br />Well, terror may produce concessions.  But if those concessions merely mean that everyone has to become more fair, they can be achieved without terrorist aggression.  And if the demands are only to satisfy the greed and racism of the terrorists and their supporters, these concessions are arbitrary, and they will not produce long-term benefits to anyone.  I think that those who value truth are more likely to understand this.  And I feel that Pape could have spent more time analyzing the negative effects of pro-terrorist propaganda and the possibilities for improving the situation here.  I think truth constitutes the third major idea in battling terrorism.<br /><br />The final idea is to simply make (or not make) concessions.  And while Pape has plenty to say about this, I think he could do a much better job here.  Oh, he does realize that concessions enhance the effectiveness of terrorism.  And he explicitly warns us about incremental concessions.  But I think he fails to distinguish between types of concessions.<br /><br />In my opinion, any legitimate acts (which might lead towards peace) that might be regarded as concessions will not be among terrorist demands.  There are two reasons for this.  First, such concessions will be offered for free anyway.  Second, the terrorists want war, not peace.  Terrorist demands will be primarily for things that will directly promote war: stuff like the release of jailed terrorists, the donation of money and weapons to terrorists, abandonment of land to terrorists, and above all, public apologies for \\"crimes\\" thatthe terrorists falsely accuse others of.  Generally, some of these demands seem \\"reasonable\\" to some neutral observers.  And that may be enough to keep the terrorists going indefinitely.  I think Pape ought to have spent more time discussing the reverse strategy: keeping terrorists in jail, annexing portions of disputed land, cutting off supplies of money and weapons, and making pro-terrorist propaganda an international issue.<br /><br />In spite of all this, I think it is an interesting book.the terrorists falsely accuse others of.

It begins with 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 (yes, those who have second thoughts with Black after seeing the almost inevitable 2 d4 can still change their minds and play 2...d6, switching to a Pirc, but that's another story).<br /><br />Gallagher leads us through the main lines we need to know to play this defense, as well as to decide what to play against it with White.  We begin with the Classical: 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 Nc3 dxe4 4 Nxe4.  And I agree with the author that those interested in this ought to buy Tal's book on his 1960 match versus Botvinnik as well.  Black has a choice of 4...Bf5, which is fairly solid, or 4...Nd7, which can be a little trickier, or the more dubious 4...Nf6.  The Classical lines take up over half the book.<br /><br />Then we proceed to the Advance Variation (1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5).  Gallagher spends quite a bit of time on 3...c5 here.  In this, Black is playing an Advance Variation of the French defense a tempo down.  We also see a good analysis of 3...Bf5 4 Nc3, where White hopes to launch a kingside attack that includes g4 as a tempo-gaining shot at that f5 Bishop.<br /><br />Next is the Panov (1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 c4).  This is my favorite for White.  That's because I can use this analysis to play White against the Scandinavian, the Queen's Gambit Declined (if I open 1 d4), and even the Nimzo-Indian (the same isolated queen pawn position can arise in all of these).  After 4...Nf6 5 Nc3 e6 6 Nf3 Be7 7 cxd5 Nxd5, we're there (the author now recommends 8 Bd3).  Gallagher talks about that isolated White Queen pawn, and how minor piece trades tend to favor Black here by reducing White's attacking chances.<br /><br />Late in the book, there is a section on the move 2 c4, which I think Gallagher ought to have given a little more discussion.  This is an attempt by White to get to a Panov before committing to playing d4.  The idea is to make it harder for Black to employ certain defences (such as 5...g6) that might otherwise be used versus the Panov.  After 1 e4 c6 2 c4 (I agree with Gallagher that this move looks ugly, leaving that awful hole on d4), I think Black ought to be considering 2...e5, and Gallagher gives a couple of brief ideas here.  However, Black is often content to get into a Panov with 2...d5.  Next is 3 exd5, to which the author gives 3...cxd5 as the automatic response.  But I disagree.  I think the automatic response ought to be 3...Nf6!?  After that, White will have to humbly crawl back into the Panov with 4 d4, and let Black defend against it any way she wants to.  Or else \\"win\\" Black's pawn with 4 dxc6 Nxc6, but this is a well-known position from the Scandinavian, and most folks would already prefer Black.<br /><br />After 1 e4 c6 2 c4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 cxd5 Nf6, I think White is getting what she wants after 5 Nc3, and she even has the option of playing 5 Bb5+ instead.<br /><br />This book also has three pages on the Exchange Variation (1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 Bd3).  And it has a section on the infamous Fantasy Variation (1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 f3).  I once fell into a famous trap in this line that Gallagher boasts he won three games in as White.  I, and Gallagher's opponents, played the following first nine suicidal moves as Black:<br /><br />1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 f3 dxe4 4 fxe4 e5 5 Nf3 exd4? 6 Bc4 Bb4+? 7 c3  dxc3 8 Bxf7+ (this wins by force) Kxf7 9 Qxd8 cxb2+ 10 Ke2 bxc1=N+ (as the book shows, 10...bxa1=Q gets Black mated, so I tried something else) 11 Rxc1 (White's advantage is overwhelming but now my opponent demonstrates that with bad enough play, any position can be compromised) 11...Bg4 12 Qc7+ Nd7 13 Qxb7 Rb8 14 Qxa7 Nc7 15 Nc3 Bc5 16 Qc7 Rb2+ 17 Ke1 Rxg2 18 Qf4+ Ke8 19 Rab1 Rf8 20 Rb8+ Nxb8 21 Qxb8+ Bc8 22 Ne5 Bf2+ 23 White Resigns<br /><br />This book is very readable and clear, and I think it is an excellent introduction to the Caro-Kann.

I think the automatic response ought to be 3...Nf6!?  After that, White will have to humbly crawl back into the Panov with 4 d4, and let Black defend against it any way she wants to.  Or else \\"win\\" Black's pawn with 4 dxc6 Nxc6, but this is a well-known position from the Scandinavian, and most folks would already prefer Black.      After 1 e4 c6 2 c4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 cxd5 Nf6, I think White is getting what she wants after 5 Nc3, and she even has the option of playing 5 Bb5+ instead.    This book also has three pages on the Exchange Variation (1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 exd5 cxd5 4 Bd3).  And it has a section on the infamous Fantasy Variation (1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 f3).  I once fell into a famous trap in this line that Gallagher boasts he won three games in as White.  I, and Gallagher's opponents, played the following first nine suicidal moves as Black:    1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 f3 dxe4 4 fxe4 e5 5 Nf3 exd4? 6 Bc4 Bb4+? 7 c3  dxc3 8 Bxf7+ (this wins by force) Kxf7 9 Qxd8 cxb2+ 10 Ke2 bxc1=N+ (as the book shows, 10...bxa1=Q gets Black mated, so I tried something else) 11 Rxc1 (White's advantage is overwhelming but now my opponent demonstrates that with bad enough play, any position can be compromised) 11...Bg4 12 Qc7+ Nd7 13 Qxb7 Rb8 14 Qxa7 Nc7 15 Nc3 Bc5 16 Qc7 Rb2+ 17 Ke1 Rxg2 18 Qf4+ Ke8 19 Rab1 Rf8 20 Rb8+ Nxb8 21 Qxb8+ Bc8 22 Ne5 Bf2+ 23 White Resigns    This book is very readable and clear, and I think it is an excellent introduction to the Caro-Kann.  I recommend it.	2005-08-13

But I think that too much of it is simply a disgusting paean to racist attacks on human rights, with sneering taunts directed at any attempts by Israelis to protect their rights.<br /><br />Yes, there are discussions of Israelis being thrilled by the prospect of finally being allowed to visit nearby Petra, on the Jordanian side of the border.  And there is even an admission that it is \\"preposterous\\" for an Egyptian video to imply that European Jews \\"deserved to suffer genocide\\" and that Arab suffering is the result \\"of Jewish existence.\\"<br /><br />Yes, there's quite a bit of material that a scholar could find useful.

Buber's intelligence and sincerity are on display throughout it.  Of course, I disagree with much of what Buber says.  I'm a Polytheist, and I do not like Monotheistic religions.  And I find some of Buber's advice to Israelis to be puzzling at times.  Even after the British White Paper of 1939, he thought a Levantine Jewish state unnnecessary, although he admitted that most Levantine Jews disagreed.  Still, one can see in these essays how he's always interested in equal rights, including rights for Jews that are neither more nor less than those of others.<br /><br />I know that some Zionists are more than a little suspicious of Buber.  But please try reading Mohandas Gandhi's 1938 article, \\"The Jews.\\"  I consider that article a vicious repudiation of human rights.  Then read Buber's calm and dignified response to it.<br /><br />I know that many anti-Zionists like to cite Buber.  But I would advise them to copy his honesty and sincerity, traits I have been seeing far too little of from modern anti-Zionists.  In my opinion, Buber would have been more than a little hesitant to excuse, let alone support, Arab aggression and slander, all in the name of equal rights.	2005-08-13

But she sure doesn't seem that way to me.  This book does make me want to become a human rights activist, however, if only to try to counter some of the damage people like Kathy Kelly are doing.<br /><br />I think it is a good question to ask if we Americans are behaving properly in Iraq.  Especially from the standpoint of human rights.  We surely could use some sensible advice.  But Kelly is not the one to provide it.<br /><br />One test I give Kelly is what she says about the Israeli attack on the terrorists in Jenin in April, 2002.  Israel went out of its way to use ground troops, incurring more casualties in an effort to reduce the number of civilian casualties.  The Israeli doves were successful in convincing Israel to take this approach.  And that makes this a true test: if Kelly can't find a way to praise this, she's no supporter of human rights.<br /><br />Anyway, the author flunks this test completely, writing dishonestly about Jenin and even going so far as to blast America for permitting Israel to defend itself against terrorism.  If she's going to cheer for anti-American terrorists and mislead us about what is happening, I think we have little reason to trust her advice.	2005-08-12

Perhaps you'll even want to try one of these defences yourself.  This well written book can help you do both.<br /><br />The Chigorin is the soundest of these three choices.  White can try 3 cxd5, 3 Nc3, or 3 Nf3.  I think the line that gives Black the most trouble is 3 cxd5 Qxd5 4 e3 e5 5 Nc3 Bb4 6 Bd2 Bxc3 7 Bxc3 exd4 8 Ne2 Nf6 9 Nxd4 0-0 10 Nb5 Qg5 11 Nxc7.  This book tells about it and gives some suggestions.  But, sure, I'd rather have White here.<br /><br />The Baltic isn't a good choice for Black.  3 cxd5 Bxb1 4 Qa4+ c6 5 Rxb1 is good for White.  And even 3 cxd5 Bxb1 4 Rxb1 favors White.  Black has to hope for 3 Qb3 e5 or 3 Nc3 e6, which, as this book shows, are not nearly as good choices for White.<br /><br />Still, there is a line in the Baltic that is worth knowing if one plays the Slav, namely 3 Nf3.  The reason is that White may try 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3.  Now what?  What happened to that Slav you were going to play?  And is this your chance to get that Queen Bishop outside your pawn chain?<br /><br />Yes.  It is.  You can play 2...Bf5 and if 3 c4 e6 4 Nc3 c6, with a favorable version of a Slav.  Ward gives a couple of games to show how this can go, but one can see more in books on the Slav.<br /><br />In the Albin, my suggestion for White, which the book does not entirely agree with, is 3 dxe5 d4 4 Nf3 Nc6 5 Nbd2 (the book recommends 5 g3) Bg4 6 a3.  Here, Ward recommends 6...Nge7 for Black, but I still prefer White and so does he.<br /><br />The Albin seems to me to be a bunch of traps.  The most ridiculous is the following suicidal play by White: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 d4 4 e3? Bb4+ 5 Bd2 dxe3 6 Bxb4 exf2+ 7 Ke2 fxg1=N 8 Rxg1 Bg4+ 9 White resigns.  But the author shows us some quick wins for Black in saner lines.  One is 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 d4 4 e4 Nc6 5 f4 f6 6 exf6 Nxf6 7 Bd3 Bb4+ 8 Bd2 Ng4 9 Nf3 Ne3 10 Qe2 0-0 11 g3 Bg4 12 a3 Ne5 13 Bxb4 Nxf3+ 14 Kf2 Rxf4 15 gxf4 Qh4 mate.<br /><br />You may protest that White ought to play an early a3 to avoid all this.  But Ward also shows us the following: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 d4 4 Nf3 Nc6 5 a3 f6 6 exf6 Nxf6 7 g3 Bg4 8 Nbd2 a5 9 b3 Bc5 10 Bb2 0-0 11 Bg2 Qd7 12 0-0 Rae8 13 Re1 Bh3 14 b4 axb4 15 Nb3 b6 16 Nxc5 bxc5 17 axb4 Nxb4 18 Ra5 Bxg2 19 Kxg2 20 Ba3 Qh3+! (winning for Black).<br /><br />Even in Ward's recommended line for White, namely 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 d4 4 Nf3 Nc6 5 g3, we see a couple of games where Black wins fast by pushing her h-pawn and getting her Queen Bishop to h3 (generally via e6 or f5).<br /><br />I wouldn't want to play the Albin with Black, in spite of all these possibilities, but some of you might want to try it, or the Baltic or the Chigorin, for Black.  And I do recommend this book to learn all these openings for White.Ne3 10 Qe2 0-0 11 g3 Bg4 12 a3 Ne5 13 Bxb4 Nxf3+ 14 Kf2 Rxf4 15 gxf4 Qh4 mate.

No matter what your political views may be, a book that tells the truth will be helpful.  On the other hand, no matter what your political views may be, this book won't help.  It can't be trusted.<br /><br />The topic I'm expert enough to judge this book on is Israel.  And what Pilger has to say about it is way off.<br /><br />Now, what kinds of comments could one make about Israel?  One could say that while Jews are not allowed to live in Saudi Arabia, and while they don't live in Jordan either, nor (at least in significant numbers) in much of the rest of the region, Jews are permitted to live in Israel, and even to have human rights there!  And that many folks in the United Nations, the European Union, the Arab world, and elsewhere in the international community, rather than deploring the racist exclusion of Jews in much of the Arab world, deplore the existence of human rights in Israel!<br /><br />Pilger does not say that!<br /><br />It seems to me an extraordinary manifestation of racism for Israel to be excluded from the Mediterranean Games.  But Pilger does not mention this.  No, he's too busy implying that Arafat was a statesman, not a thug.  And that the Israeli attempts to defend its citizens from terror is just a sneaky trick, designed to hurt innocent Arabs.  And that the BBC is too biased in favor (!) of Israel.<br /><br />As I said, no matter what your politics may be, what you want is a book you can trust with its facts.

But not all that many on Pagan theology.  That means that a book like this one could be pioneering, but it might also be trivial.<br /><br />In spite of all that has been written about monotheistic theology, I find the concept of a \\"perfect Creator,\\" let alone a just, good, omnescient, or omnipresent one rather silly.  In my opinion, real Goddesses and Gods are perfections of attributes.  Now, is that what most folks think?  Is it what the author of this book thinks?<br /><br />Well, it isn't something everyone agrees on.  As York says in his preface, the associate provost of Boston University finds neopagans \\"confused, deluded, frivolous, and devoid of intellectual seriousness.\\"  Hey, that's what I think of the Christians, Jews, and Muslims!  Anyway, the provost's point is that Pagan religions offer no ethical guidance.  And there is something to that.  Pagans often try to learn how to contribute as best they can in areas they feel are of value.  Monotheists worry more about what it is they ought to value.  But to claim that monotheists offer ethical guidance is something of an exaggeration, as is the suggestion that Pagans offer less ethical guidance.<br /><br />So I can see why York wrote this book.  He's quite properly defending the claim that Pagan religions are serious.<br /><br />York begins with a chapter on Paganism as religion.  He starts by leaving out the monotheists, the Buddhists, and even the Hindus (huh?) as Pagans.  And he discusses folk religions of China, Japan, and elsewhere.  The focus is on supernatural aspects.<br /><br />Next comes a chapter on Paganism as behavior.  That means the commitment that Pagans display.  But just what is that commitment to?  There is some description of some Gods and Goddesses, but I don't think York really answers this question well.  There is also some description of ritual.  But is ritual a mere display of commitment?  Or does it have an independent significance in making one a different person?  At least, this chapter devotes a great deal of space to Hinduism.  As well as Buddhism and monotheism.<br /><br />At the end of the book, the author has a chapter on Paganism as theology.  He tells of the difference between Paganism and Gnosticism.  And he addresses the charge that Pagan religions can be reactionary, fascist, chauvinist, and racist (actually, this charge can be made against monotheistic religions as well).<br /><br />This is a pretty good book.  But I think we're still awaiting a serious and pioneering work on the topic.e in making one a different person?   At least, this chapter devotes a great deal of space to Hinduism.

Even Chafets admits that the latter group tends to view Israel as largely to blame for Arab aggression.  Is that really rational?<br /><br />In my opinion, the German takeover of Czechoslovakia in the 1930s was not a battle of competing nationalisms.  The Czechs had no designs on Germany.  Similarly, the Israelis have no designs on Saudi Arabia, or any other Arab lands.  Their crime is to want to keep their own land, and their reason is because they can't defend their rights without it.<br /><br />The Arab war on Israel does not make sense as a dispute over territory either.  The Arabs are land-rich!  They could have had every inch of Israel, with Jewish approval, had they been willing to abide Jewish rights there.  But they weren't willing to do that.  Now, they want to find a way to destroy Jewish rights, and that means finding an excuse, any excuse to destroy Israel.  Does that make me an \\"emotionalist?\\"  Well, no.  I'm just being rational.  Since I'm not an Arab or Israeli, that ought to be the end of it.  But I'm writing about this because I support truth and scholarship.  And in this war, I've seen the opponents of Israel behave in a nearly uniform anti-scholarly and dishonest manner.<br /><br />In short, the \\"emotionalists\\" are right.  Those who wanted to deprive Jews of human rights did not have enough fun in the last ten or fifteen centuries.  Not even World War Two was good enough to satisfy them.  Now they want more, and they are happy to sacrifice academic standards, justice, and anything else that gets in their way.<br /><br />Chafets does not come to this conclusion at all.  Instead, he merely points out that Israeli attitudes are ambivalent.  But there are a couple of places where I think what Chafets says, in all sincerity, ought to be reflected upon.  For example, he says that when terrorists murdered hostages at Maalot, \\"the chances of Israel negotiating with Yasir Arafat ended for good.\\"<br /><br />Obviously, Israel got pressured into negotiating with Arafat anyway.  And upon reflection, most of us can see that this was an error.  Maybe upon further reflection, most of us can see that in the future, terrorized nations may be far less likely to negotiate with thugs such as Arafat.<br /><br />I think Chafets is good at describing Israel, and he seems to give us a reasonable picture of the place.  I recommend this book.standards, justice, and anything else that gets in their way. <br /> <br />Chafets does not come to this conclusion at all.

But Cox does give a game that goes 1 e4 Nf6 2 Nc3 d5 3 e5 Ne4 4 Nce2 d4 5 c3.  That's a good line for White, and Black would be better off with 2...e5, letting White choose between a Vienna and a Four Knights.<br /><br />Now, what about the Alekhine with Black?  You may say you don't play it!  But what if you get in a blindfold game, and your opponent plays 1 d4 Nf6 2 e5 (only now do you discover that White's first move was 1 e4).  Or maybe you are in a 5-minute game and you want to have some fun with Black and not play your main defence.  The author boasts that you can be prepared to meet 1 e4 in 30 minutes.  Against the main line, you can try 4...dxe5 5 Nxe5 c6.  Against 1 e4 Nf6 2 e5 Nd5 3 d4 d6 4 c4, you play 4...Nb6 5 f4 (if 5 exd6 exd6) dxe5 6 fxe5 c5 7 d5 g6.

And if White avoids the Alekhine with 1 e4 Nf6 2 Nc3, you play 2...e5, settling for that Vienna game.<br /><br />The author also gives recommendations for positional and tactical repertoires for Black.<br /><br />Years ago, I tried playing the Alekhine in four games.  Two opponents played the main line.  I tried 4...dxe5 5 Nxe5 g6 (which Cox devotes two games to).  The first time I saw this, I continued as Cox recommends, with 6 Bc4 c6.  But I soon got in trouble.  In the other game, I answered 6 Bc4 with 6...Be6.

Of course.  We need some thoughtful, objective, and constructive criticism.  And some good advice.  But this book doesn't provide it.<br /><br />I'll mention just a couple of areas where I think the book disqualifies itself from being helpful.  The first is in the discussion of a racist American backlash against innocent Arab Americans.  And a backlash against dissent from American policies.  That's something that I do not take lightly.  And what this book says will, in my opinion, make matters worse.  Mahajan says \\"the backlash against dissent got so bad that even one tenured professor lost his job because of it.\\"<br /><br />Um, who lost his job?<br /><br />Sami al-Arian!  For those of you who don't know who he is, he's on trial for having been the North American leader of Islamic Jihad, a notorious terrorist group that has claimed \\"credit\\" for attacks that have killed at least 100 people in Israel and the disputed West Bank territories.  He's also accused of having played a crucial role in writing the Jihad's constitution, raising money for the Jihad, helping other Jihad leaders enter the United States, and planning an extensive espionage operation.<br /><br />If there were just one person the United States ought to have been firing from their position, arresting, and putting on trial, it might well have been al-Arian.

He's not the right person to try to defend by implying that his only crime was that \\"in his youth\\" he made \\"an intemperate speech.\\"<br /><br />Well, let's see how this book deals with the Levant.  The author says that the Oslo process was about the Arabs \\"bargaining away part of their internationally recognized rights to the whole of the occupied territories.\\"  Unfortunately for him, there is no such right to all of the disputed West Bank.  Nor is there even a right to ethnically cleanse all Jews (or Arabs) who might wind up on the \\"wrong\\" side of the Israeli border.<br /><br />You can give constructive advice on how to deal with terrorism.

It is as if Bishara does not realize that most Arab \\"moderates\\" (not to mention the extremists) are well to the right, politically, of fascism, and even further to the right of Sharon.  And if Bishara doesn't like Sharon, just why didn't he oppose the Arab violence that preceded (and helped ensure) Sharon's election?<br /><br />As near as I can tell, Bishara wants to turn back the clock a couple of centuries, perhaps to a time when Blacks and Jews, um, knew their place.

He pretends that the disputed West Bank is \\"occupied\\" territory.  And he seems to want to destroy Israel by pumping in Arabs who promise to vote to abolish human rights for Jews there. Well, maybe he ought to consider the possibility that what goes around can come around.  Greedy and dishonest aggressors do not always win.  World War Two proved that.<br /><br />The author keeps talking about Israel, Israel, and Israel as if Israel were the solution to all of the world's problems.  But it isn't.  He and those who agree with him ought to grow up.	2005-08-03

McDonald (1886-1964) was Chairman of the Foreign Policy Association from 1919 to 1933.  From 1933 to 1935, he was the League of Nations High Commissioner for German Refugees.  And he was the first United States Ambassador to Israel (from 1948 to 1951).  By the way, McDonald was also familiar, first-hand, with the \\"appalling race problem\\" in South Africa.<br /><br />McDonald's diaries show that as early as 1933, he believed that the Nazis were considering the mass killing of Europe's Jews.  McDonald had met with and interviewed Hitler on April 8, 1933.<br /><br />One of the more striking parts of this book tells of McDonald's meeting with of Ernest Bevin in 1948.  The author was \\"aghast\\" at Bevin's arrogance and lies.  Facing him, he had to tell himself \\"that this was not Hitler seated before me but His Majesty's Principle Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\\"  And he reports that Bevin, like Hitler and Mussolini in his interviews with them in the 1930's, had impressed him with a \\"complete sense of ruthlessness.\\"  Those who want to get a little first-hand information about Bevin may want to read this book.<br /><br />In August, 1948, the British officials that McDonald met with were very strongly against recognizing Israel.  Instead, many of them hoped to destroy it, or at least remove the Negev and Jerusalem from it.  And they hoped to get the United Nations to declare Israel as an aggressor and thus coax the United States into cooperating in sanctions against Israel.  The author also met with Count Bernadotte, whom he characterizes in this book as \\"charming, public spirited, wholly devoted but not unusually able or perceptive.\\"  As McDonald relates, Bernadotte had suggested giving all of Jerusalem to the Arabs.  This totally discredited Bernadotte among the Jews.  Bernadotte basically favored (and appeared to parrot) anti-Israeli proposals put forth by the British Foreign Office.<br /><br />McDonald's book continues by telling of the events of the ensuing couple of years.  He's at his best in describing the many public figures he met with.  Given the amount of absurd \\"revisionist\\" history about this time period, I recommend this dose of reality to those who want to know about the early days of modern Israel.h by the British Foreign Office. <br /> <br />McDonald's book continues by telling of the events of the ensuing couple of years.

It starts by briefly describing Scandinavia and even telling a little about the Norse Goddesses and Gods.  Then we see a history of the notorious Viking raids, which began near the end of the eighth century AD.  There's plenty of material about the Viking adventures in England.  But we also get to read about Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and other Viking destinations, including North America and Russia.  And there's a mention of the famous Icelandic Sagas, the best known Viking literature.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, and I recommend it.	2005-07-31
141713:US	53071109	R27DY64CZMJ2LC	1901983196	839168715	The Gambit Guide to the English Opening: 1...e5	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A very useful chess book on 1...e5 in the English Opening	I think a chess player ought to know at least a little about how to play the most typical first moves for White.  That means having some sort of repertoire with 1 e4.  And 1 d4.  And 1 Nf3.  And, yes, 1 c4.<br /><br />That's where this book comes in.  Black may answer 1 c4 with 1...e5  (you'll need to find out what to do about other replies in other books, of course).  Now you play 2 Nc3 (if you want to do something else, maybe this isn't the right book for you: it spends 230 pages on 2 Nc3 and 17 pages on everything else combined).  And Hansen shows you what you can do in response to all the popular Black systems at that point.  Namely:<br /><br />2...f5<br />2...d6<br />2...Bb4<br />2...Nf6 3 Nf3 (my choice as White).  Black can try 3...e4 or 3...d6.<br />2...Nf6 3 g3<br />2...Nc6 3 Nf3.  Black can try 3...d6 or 3...Bb4 or 3...f5 or 3...g6?!  Or 3...Nf6.<br /><br />After 1 c4 e5 2 Nc3 Nc6 3 Nf3 Nf6, White has a bunch of choices: 4 a3, 4 d3, 4 d4, 4 e4, 4 e3, and the most popular, namely 4 g3.  My recommendation, for what it is worth, is 4 d3.  Hansen spends three pages on this move, while the rest combined get 73 pages.<br /><br />Of course, there is another potential use for this book.  You can prepare to use 1...e5 as your defence to 1 c4.  I'm happy that Hansen spends over 18 pages on 2...Bb4.  That's an atypical system that I'd recommend looking at, just to see if you like it.<br /><br />Why would anyone want to play 1...e5 with Black against 1 c4?  I'll tell you why I do it.  Many years ago, I had to play a tournament game against someone who liked to play the English.  I told a friend, a novice at chess (USCF rating 1017) that I'd probably be facing 1 c4.  He asked if I wanted to try a practice game.  I secretly doubted that playing Black against a 1017 player would help me much, but I consented.  Our practice game, however, was a shock that I still remember vividly:<br /><br />1 c4 c5 2 Nc3 Nf6 3 g3 e6 4 Nf3 (4 Bg2?! is not good) b6 5 Bg2 Bb7 6 d4 cxd4 7 Qxd4 Be7 8 0-0 d6 9 Rd1 0-0 10 b3 Nbd7 11 Bb2 a6 12 Qe3 Qc7 13 Nd4 Bxg2 (so far, everything has gone well, of course, I'm still in \\"book\\") 14 Kxg2 Rab8 (this was the book move, but obviously it is not very good) 15 Nf5 Nc5? (Black is still alive after 15...Rfe8 but not after this) 16 Nd5! Nxd5 (now White has a forced mate) 17 Qh6 gxh6 18 Nxh6 mate<br /><br />In the tournament game, I decided to avoid 1...c5.  I'm sure you can understand why.  In fact, I tried the unsound Bellon Gambit, mainly because I'd come up with what I thought was a new move for Black:<br /><br />1 c4 e5 2 Nc3 Nf6 3 Nf3 e4 4 Ng5 b5 5 d3 bxc4 6 dxe4 Nc6 (this was my \\"new\\" move, and I was proud of it, since, as this book explains, an immediate 6...h6 loses to 7 Nxf7) 7 e3 h6 (this move has to be played now!) 8 Nf3 Bb4 9 Qc2 Qe7 10 Nd2 Ne5 11 Be2 Ba6 12 0-0 c6 13 a3 Ba5 14 Nf3 Nxf3 15 Bxf3 Qe5 16 Qa4 0-0 17 Nd5 c3 18 Nxf6 gxf6 19 Rd1 Rfb8 20 b4 c2 21 Rd4 (a forced move that I had overlooked) c5 22 bxc5 Rb1 23 Qxa5 Rab8 24 Qd2 Rxa1 25 Qxc2 Qxd4 26 exd4 Rbb1 27 White Resigns<br /><br />Since then, I've used 1...e5 to answer 1 c4.  I even tried the Bellon Gambit once again, in a friendly game.  The first seven moves were identical to the above game, but now my opponent tried 8 Nxf7.  Obviously, if this move actually works, the Bellon Gambit is not merely unsound but unplayable.  The game continued 8...Kxf7 9 Bxc4 d5 10 Bb5 Ne5 11 f4 (Hansen's recommendation for White at this point) Bg4 12 Qb3 Ned7 13 exd5 Bc5 14 e4 Re8 15 e5 a6 16 Bc6 Nxe5! 17 fxe5 Rxe5+ 18 Kd2 Be3+ 19 Kd3 Bf5+ 20 Kc4 Rb8 21 Qa3 Nxd5 22 Nxd5 Qh4+ 23 Kc3 Qd4 mate<br /><br />This book gives the Bellon Gambit a little over two pages.  Hansen quotes Bagirov, who gives the 8 Nxf7 line as well as 8 Nf3 Bb4 9 Bd2 0-0 10 Bxc4 Bxc3 11 Bxc3 Nxe4.  In this final line, Bagirov and Hansen say that White can get an excellent game with 12 Rc1 and an even better game with 12 Qd3.  However, I think Black still has some practical chances even in these two lines.<br /><br />One complaint that I have about my particular copy of this book is that pages 129 through 160 are upside down!  I wonder if there is a quality control problem here.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I think the book itself is a great text and reference and I recommend it.ough 160 are upside down!

146227:US	53071109	R10LUIN0AOJR36	1857443799	880229820	Starting Out: Benoni Systems (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)	Books	5	15	19	N	N	Everything except the Modern Benoni	The most important thing you ought to know about this book is that it does NOT cover the Modern Benoni.  It covers the other Benoni systems.  And some of them are plenty of fun to try in a chess game, even if you are not from the town of Benoni or know anyone named Benoni (or Benjamin).<br /><br />The first half of the book is spent on the Benko Gambit, which the authors insist on calling the Volga Gambit.  Um, they can call it whatever they please.  I'm calling it the Benko Gambit.<br /><br />In any case, Raetsky and Chetverik give a good description and overview of the Benko.  There are 38 complete, analyzed games of it, about a third of which are from 2000 and later.  And I think everyone ought to try playing this gambit with Black a few times.  It sure is easy to learn it!  The ideas are fairly clear.  If the Gambit is accepted, the first few moves are automatic, and you blast away at White's Queenside with both your Rooks, your Queen, your Queenside Knight, and hopefully your fianchettoed King Bishop.  If you manage to clean up White's Queen Rook and Queen Knight pawns, and keep your passed c-pawn, that's typically a decisive advantage.<br /><br />Oh, yes, if you have White, I'd suggest turning down the Gambit.  White has good theoretical chances, but Black's moves are just too easy to find if White takes both pawns.  This book has plenty of advice to give whether you take both pawns, one pawn, or none.<br /><br />The rest of the book is devoted to \\"other\\" Benoni systems.  There are over 30 complete, analyzed games in these chapters as well.  We see the Blumenfeld Gambit, Benko/Blumenfeld hybrids, Benoni/King's Indian hybrids, Czech Benonis, Schmid Benonis, Benoni-style responses to 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3, and so on.<br /><br />Still, maybe because I like reading the Harry Potter books, my favorite section was on the Snake.  This is an unsound try by Black, and it is nearly unplayable, but I wanted to see what the book would say.  And it gave it three fully analyzed games!<br /><br />I've tried the Snake in a game.  Basically, instead of putting a pawn on d6, you put your King Bishop there, hoping to free it via c7 and eventually exchange it for the White Knight on c3 (the path the Bishop takes is what gives this opening its name).  The biggest problem with the opening is that when you move your d6 Bishop, White often can put a pawn on d6, and that tends to be lethal.<br /><br />The Snake starts with the moves 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 e6 4 Nc3 (the book also analyzes Snakes against 4 Nf3) 4...exd5 5 cxd5 Bd6.  The line that gives Black the most trouble, in my opinion and in the authors' is 6 e4 0-0 7 f4.  Now what?<br /><br />Well, I guess one can play something like 7...Bc7 and hope to survive.  With luck, you may get a continuation like 8 e5 Ne8 9 d6 Ba5 10 Bc4 Kh8 11 Be3 f6 12 Qh5 g6 13 Qh6 Ng7 14 Bxc5 fxe5 15 fxe5 Bxc3+ 16 bxc3 Qa5 17 Bd4 Nc6 18 Qd2 Nxe5 (now the worst is over and anything might happen).  But nobody does that.  I've seen a couple of games from strong Masters with Black.  They, the book, and I all recommend the desperate sacrifice 7...Nxe4.  White will play 8 Nxe4 Re8 9 Qe2.  What do you do next?<br /><br />The move the Masters both tried was 9...Bf8.  And one of them won brilliantly.  But the book says that the Black's best try (not good enough to equalize, but to at least have some chance) is 9...Na6 10 Nf3 f5 11 Nxd6 Rxe2+ 12 Bxe2 Nb4.<br /><br />When I tried this line as Black, I didn't know about 9...Na6.  My game went 9...Bc7 10 d6 Bxd6 11 Qc4 Bxf4 12 Bxf4 d5 13 Qxc5 Rxe4+ 14 Ne2 Qe8 15 Bxb8 Rxb8 16 Qxd5 Bg4 17 Qd2 Rd8 18 Qc2 Rc8 19 Qd2 Rc6 20 Rd1 Rce6, and Black won.

150208:US	53071109	R2JK5Y3IXL3RE0	1400062306	657112830	Infidels: A History of the Conflict Between Christendom and Islam	Books	3	12	14	N	N	Interesting but unconvincing	I enjoyed reading this book.  It told me plenty about some of the religious wars between Islam and Christendom.  And it emphasized some of the misconceptions each side had about the other.  Wheatcroft is especially good at showing some of the incitement used.  And he warns us all to be careful about getting carried away with our suspicions and risking unnecessary and counterproductive wars!  He wisely urges us to take our language seriously.  I agree.  We need to stick with truth.  And we ought to be careful about provoking others by using strong and misleading language.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book does have a problem.  It is all well and good to warn folks not to fight.  But once one of them breaks the law, and commits assault, robbery, or murder, it is not sufficient to tell that person to be more reasonable.  We have to focus on enforcing the law.  That is true when nations step out of line as well.  We need to concentrate on truth and reality and decide what to do about it.  The author cites Lincoln, who appealed to \\"the better angels of our nature.\\"  He would do well to remind us that Lincoln also led us in civil war that was extremely destructive.  Wheatcroft also has praise for Teddy Roosevelt, who said it was good to \\"speak softly and carry a big stick.\\"  With all this praise for these two Presidents, I would expect a little more sympathy with those who say we may need to fight some real enemies in the future.<br /><br />In my opinion, the author has gone overboard to come up with equivalences between anti-Semitic speeches by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir and a few wild comments by American General William Boykin.  I think Boykin has been pretty far out of line.  And he is indeed in a position of some responsibility.  But Mahathir was in a position of much greater responsibility in his country.  And while I think there is a real threat of the United States getting into a war that the majority of us would reject if we knew all the facts and were unaffected by all the propaganda, at least our potential targets are nations that are way out of line.  The only questions are the severity of the threat each poses, the practical risks, and the overall morality.<br /><br />Mahathir, however, represents a genuine problem: he's part of a Muslim world and he's encouraging it to take us on, right or wrong.  And he wants to start by having 1300 million Muslims (in his words) defeat a \\"few million Jews.\\"  This is not merely a poor choice of words or unfortunate misunderstanding.  In my opinion, Mahathir is sounding like an Axis leader from the late 1930s, and Boykin is sounding like an American General from the same time period.  There is a big difference between these two positions.<br /><br />An example of the author's corresponding lack of sympathy for those who warn us that we may need to fight is his discussion of the book \\"An End to Evil\\" by David Frum and Richard Perle.  It is no surprise that Wheatcroft finds fault with this book.  You may want to read my own review of it.  And yes, Frum and Perle do not speak all that softly.  They do indeed use plenty of \\"political\\" words.  And they are trying to make a case.  But are they really more a part of the problem than of the solution?  Does their book truly deserve to be compared with a fifteenth-century tract by Kramer and Sprenger against \\"witchcraft?\\"  Don't forget that as a Pagan, I may be biased against this awful Kramer and Sprenger book, but I still say that Wheatcroft has gone overboard again with this.  After all, in this age of disinformation, Frum and Perle do make some points that I think we all ought to consider:<br /><br />*  Neither the Ku Klux Klan nor Jesse James were a \\"national resistance.\\" Describing their political heirs as such is incorrect.<br /><br />*  Toppling Saddam Hussein denied a huge victory to our enemies and may make future potential aggressors think twice about taking us on.<br /><br />*  American Muslims ought to be expected, as citizens, to stop the flow of their funds to terror, end incitement in their schools and mosques, stop promoting anti-Semitism, and avoid denials and excuses for failing to do this.<br /><br />*  Whenever militant Islam approaches power, it turns its wrath on women.<br /><br />*  The Arab-Israeli conflict is not a cause but a manifestation of Islamic extremism.<br /><br />*  Respect for America on the world stage rests not merely on our power and wealth but also on our moral authority. If we go back on our principles, we give credence to charges that we're a \\"rogue nation, an imperial state, and a threat to world order.\\"<br /><br />*  At the UN, \\"the heroes are in fact thieves, thugs, liars, and killers. The UN regularly broadcasts a spectacle as dishonest and morally deadening as a Stalinist show trial.\\"<br /><br />*  The defeat of Muslim extremism will come, maybe sooner than most of us expect.<br /><br />I think Wheatcroft ought to have considered these points more seriously before appearing to dismiss this entire work as inciteful witch-hunting propaganda.o be expected, as citizens, to stop the flow of their funds to terror, end incitement in their schools and mosques, stop promoting anti-Semitism, and avoid denials and excuses for failing to do this.  <br /> <br />*  Whenever militant Islam approaches power, it turns its wrath on women.  <br /> <br />*  The Arab-Israeli conflict is not a cause but a manifestation of Islamic extremism.  <br /> <br />*  Respect for America on the world stage rests not merely on our power and wealth but also on our moral authority.

But I think that to be objective, one needs to be honest rather than \\"balanced.\\"  When one tells the truth, there will indeed be ugly facts about everyone.  But that is all right.  The problem comes in trying to achieve \\"balance\\" by inserting a few popular but malicious lies.  These lies then can serve as a litmus test for some readers, who then consider you and your work to be discredited.<br /><br />In this book, there is one question I wish the author would have asked more often when considering the Arab position.  Namely, had the Jews done nothing offensive in any respect, what would the Arabs have done about it?  In some cases, Dowty does admit that Arab \\"responses\\" would have been the same had there been no \\"provocation\\" at all.<br /><br />The author begins with five points, none of which I entirely agree with:<br /><br />1) This is not an age-old conflict.<br /><br />Although the present violence seems to have started only in the past 130 years, the battle against Jewish rights in the Middle East has lasted for many centuries.<br /><br />2) This conflict is not caused by ethnic hatreds.<br /><br />To me, Arabic-speakers and Hebrew-speakers seem to be of different ethnicities.<br /><br />3) This conflict is not rooted in a clash of religions.<br /><br />Maybe so, but Islam is often invoked in the battle against Jewish rights.<br /><br />4) This conflict is solvable.<br /><br />Obviously it is solvable, but I'm not so sure it can be solved by giving land to land-rich Arabs and by making arbitrary rules against Jewish rights in the region.<br /><br />5) The core of this conflict is two claims to the same land.<br /><br />I doubt this.  After all, even if the Arabs got every single inch of Israel and the West Bank, I suspect that few of them would be satisfied were Israel merely to move to Jordan or the Sinai (or, worse, Kuwait).  I think the core of this conflict is whether Jews ought to have human rights.<br /><br />To his credit, Dowty does note that the early Modern Zionists saw no problem with the fact that Arabs and others (including Jews) lived in the Levant.  After all, the Zionists wanted human rights and justice for everyone.  And he shows that one reason why Jews were a minority in the Levant (although they were a majority in Jerusalem by 1880) was that the Ottoman Empire had laws against them moving there, buying land, and building on land.  I think those who look on these laws proudly and then claim the land for the Arabs on the grounds that Jews didn't move there are being dishonest, not just hypocritical.<br /><br />The author does discuss the issue of whether there was a Levantine Arab people 100 years ago.  But I think this issue is bogus: the Arabs have fought Jewish rights as Arabs, not as Levantine Arabs.  And there is an argument that Arabs ought not allow Jews to \\"steal\\" any of their land.  But that is bogus too: it would make the whole world off-limits to legitimate purchase of any land by minorities.<br /><br />There is a mention of Deir Yassin.  The Arabs did not like the Jewish victory at Deir Yassin.  What is not said is that the Jewish attack on Deir Yassin was close to the very first attack on any town, anywhere, by Jews, as Jews, in well over 900 years.  I think many Arabs would have screamed bloody murder about it even had no Arab been scratched, let alone seriously wounded or killed.  For this reason, I tend to be somewhat suspicious of Arab claims of great Jewish wrongdoing here.  I see the Jewish victory here as part of a triumph over tyranny, much like the Allied victory in 1942 at Stalingrad, albeit on a smaller scale.<br /><br />The description of the 1967 Six-Day War is reasonable.  But it fails to put Arab claims of merely defending themselves in perspective.  One could equally well call the German invasion of Poland in 1939 \\"defensive.\\"<br /><br />Dowty says that in 1988, Arafat \\"renounced terrorism.\\"  That's untrue.  At most, hepretended to say he renounced it.  Dowty does point out that the Oslo Declaration of Principles, in 1993, was completely ambiguous.  I agree with his implication that this was not very clever and was in fact a fatal flaw in them.  The author mentions the 1996 Arab riots over the opening of a door to the Herodian tunnel, but fails to expose these as totally unprovoked by Israel.  And while he does admit that the Arabs were the aggressors against Israel in 2000, he gives too much credence to their ridiculous claims that they merely wanted justice!<br /><br />The author discusses the \\"demographic problem\\" in the region as if 5 million Jews are simply too few to dominate 8000 square miles (let alone 11,000) in peacetime.  I think that in peacetime, the Jews and Levantine Arabs would each buy at least twice this much land.<br /><br />The author concludes by asking if this conflict is a tragedy of Right against Right.  This leaves me aghast.  Would he say that the conflict between the Blacks and the Ku Klux Klan is one of Right against Right?  Jewish rights do not preclude Arab rights, and Arab rights do not preclude Jewish rights.  In my opinion, if the Arabs are willing to abide Jewish rights, the conflict will be over.  There may indeed eventually be more (or other) Arab states.  There may even be more than one Jewish state.  But I see no need for any of this, and no need at all for a state whose only purpose is to terrorize some other state.<br /><br />This is an interesting book, but it has some serious flaws.I agree with his implication that this was not very clever and was in fact a fatal flaw in them.

This leaves me aghast.  Would he say that the conflict between the Blacks and the Ku Klux Klan is one of Right against Right?  Jewish rights do not preclude Arab rights, and Arab rights do not preclude Jewish rights.  In my opinion, if the Arabs are willing to abide Jewish rights, the conflict will be over.  There may indeed eventually be more (or other) Arab states.  There may even be more than one Jewish state.  But I see no need for any of this, and no need at all for a state whose only purpose is to terrorize some other state.    This is an interesting book, but it has some serious flaws.	2005-07-22

And various people pointed out flaws in Standard American bidding.  The range of our opening 1-bids was too great.  And so on.  But when I read the excellent book by Belladonna and Avarelli (two members of the winning Italian team) about the Roman Club system of bidding (this came out in 1959 in the U. S.) I was immediately struck by the emphasis on the number of losers in suit contracts:<br /><br />The number of losers is easy to estimate.  xxxx or xxx = 3 losers.  Axxx or Axx or KJx or QJx = 2 losers.  And so on.  An Ace or a King covered a loser in opener's hand.  To open the bidding, you needed at least 12 high card points and no more than 7 losers.  Suit bidding put a big emphasis on finding out which losers were covered by one's partner.<br /><br />In the present book, Ron Klinger explains a slightly more precise version of calculating losers to arrive at good suit contracts.  He starts with a formula: Add your losers to your partner's losers and deduct the sum from 24 to estimate how many tricks you will take.<br /><br />We learn details about how to count losers and how to adjust the losing trick count for trump suit quality, and controls.  And there are examples about how to reach (or avoid) games and slams.  It's certainly worth reading.<br /><br />By the way, I think that when it comes to competitive bidding, most of these ideas often go out the window if your side and the other side both have long trump suits.  The number of trumps you and your partner have in your suit plus the number the opponents have in their suit is roughly equal to the number of tricks you can take in your suit plus the number they can take in theirs!  This is sometimes called \\"the law of total tricks.\\" So you get in the habit of simply bidding the number of trumps you and your partner have between you, not caring if you make or go down.<br /><br />But when you are involved in purely constructive bidding, I think you simply have to count your losers in suit contracts.  And if you aren't already doing that, get this book.your losers in suit contracts.  And if you aren't already doing that, get this book.	2005-07-21

And Laurel Leff has done us all a service by explaining this in detail.<br /><br />Did this betrayal of journalistic standards harm anyone?  Of course it did.  Still, it happened decades ago, so why worry about it now?  Well, there are good reasons for worrying about it now.  For one thing, the New York Times hasn't improved much, judging by its biased coverage of Israel.  And while it is too late to save those who died in World War Two, there is still time to help those who are threatened today.<br /><br />Leff explains that the Times managed to ensure that fewer people would hear the last screams of those murdered in World War Two.  Now, why did the Times do such a thing?  The author analyzes this in some detail.  And part of the reason was that Sulzberger did not want his paper to appear too \\"Jewish.\\"<br /><br />I think there is a moral here, namely that journalists need to report honestly, even when honesty might appear to make their group look good or bad.<br /><br />We humans do not make good choices when the information we need is omitted or reported inaccurately.  It does no one any good if we lie on the grounds that truth might seem to be self-serving!  And I think this case shows us why.	2005-07-20

Those in this book are usually easy, however.  And that is how it should be.  Most decisions at the bridge table are pretty easy.  You just need to make the right ones consistently.<br /><br />After a brief introduction to basic probability theory, Kelsey tells us about the odds for distributions of missing cards.  The next chapter is on how to play various card combinations in a suit.<br /><br />After that, we practice combining chances as a declarer.  We learn to play for a drop in one suit before taking a risky finesse in another, and so on.<br /><br />Next is a chapter on care of options.  Sometimes, the opponents will remove one of your options.  Sometimes, you will remove one of theirs.  We learn to make some straightforward plays that take all this into account.<br /><br />Of course, one elementary aspect of bridge is that the odds change as the hand is played.  If an opponent shows out of a suit, or gives you other information about the distribution of cards, the odds can change.  And Kelsey expresses the change in odds by the number of \\"vacant places\\" that remain undetermined.<br /><br />The final elementary concept in bridge odds is generally referred to as \\"restricted choice.\\"  Kelsey finds this term confusing, so he calls it \\"freedom of choice.\\"  A simple example is when you have nine trumps, missing the Queen, Jack, five, and four.  With the Ace and King in your hand, you try the Ace.  Your left-hand opponent drops an honor!  Before that happened, you would have played for the suit to split 2-2.  But you now realize that there are only two kinds of hands your opponent could have started with: a singleton honor or both honors.  There are two hands where your opponent has a singleton (singleton Queen and singleton Jack).  And only one hand where your opponent has both honors.  So the odds are nearly 2 to 1 in favor of finessing on the next round of trumps.  That's a basic concept one has to know in bridge, and Kelsey gives some more examples of it.<br /><br />This book is easy to read but teaches some valuable lessons.  There is only one statement I seriously disagree with in it, and naturally, it is not about bridge.  Near the start of the book, Kelsey asks about the probability of a \\"tossed coin\\" to come down tails if it has come down heads nine times running.<br /><br />Kelsey is trying to explain that the chance of tails is not greater than 50%.  After all, the coin has no memory.  It is not going to come down tails just to even the odds!  Kelsey says that each toss of the coin is a separate 50% chance.<br /><br />Well, that's not quite true.  The chance of it coming down tails is not 50%.  After all, there is only one chance in 512 of a fair coin coming down heads nine times running.  The chance may be considerably greater if the coin (or the toss) is not fair.  If the coin is two-headed, the chance of nine straight heads is 100%.<br /><br />Clearly, the chance of tails on the tenth throw is less than 50%.<br /><br />I recommend this book.e, and Kelsey gives some more examples of it.

It became the capital city of the Jews very long ago, for historical reasons.  And it remains their capital today.<br /><br />Other nations have capitals.  Lithuania has Vilnius.  France has Paris.  Austria has Vienna.  Italy has Rome.  Germany has Berlin.  Even the United States has a capital city.  There is no good reason to give away, divide, or internationalize any of these capital cities.<br /><br />Other religions have holy sites.  The Christians have the Vatican.  The Muslims have the Kaaba in Mecca.  The Mormons have a Temple.  The Baha'i have a beautiful Temple.  There is no good reason to rule that the Jews, although they have a Temple-based religion as well, are Special, with no right to have a Temple in their capital city.<br /><br />In my opinion, if the Dome of the Rock is torn down to build a Jewish temple, many Muslims will complain and many Jews will appear to taunt them about it.  That will not be conducive to peace.  On the other hand, if the Jews are pressured into not having a Temple anywhere in Jerusalem, many Jews will complain, and many Muslims will appear to taunt them about it.  That will not be conducive to peace either.  I'd recommend a compromise here, with Jews being allowed to build a Temple elsewhere in Jerusalem (maybe on top of the Mount of Olives, or, better yet, on top of Mount Scopus).  It's just an idea.  But I think it might eventually resolve the religious aspects of the conflict over the Temple Mount.<br /><br />However, that will not resolve the conflict over truth, justice, and human rights.  That's a conflict that Chapman entirely overlooks.<br /><br />Chapman claims that the only Jewish claim to Jerusalem is religious.  That is preposterous.  Secular Americans claim the American capital as their own.  Seculars in France claim Paris.  And so on.  Chapman then says that the Christians who agree that Jerusalem is the Jewish capital do so for incoherent religious reasons.  That's equally preposterous.  Many simply see the issues as truth and justice.<br /><br />The author says that by contrast, Muslim claims to Jerusalem are secular: it was in Arab hands for years, and Muslims have been especially tolerant and are thus worthy of keeping it.  I have five complaints with this.  First, Jerusalem was in Jewish hands for a long time as well, and it has had a Jewish majority since the 1870s (a time when Jerusalem was virtually the only town with a Jewish majority in Asia).  Second, Jerusalem is the Jewish capital.  Third, many Muslims have been very intolerant of Jewish rights in the region and still are.  Fourth, even if the Muslims became more tolerant, that would not justify their proposed theft of the city.  Fifth, a major reason for Muslim interest in the city appears to be that it is the Jewish capital.<br /><br />Chapman calls these Muslim claims to the city an appeal to \\"principles of human rights and international law.\\"  But I think they're just taunting threats to swipe the capital city of those they wish to oppress.<br /><br />The author faults Israel for being unwilling to give away enough of its capital city.  When Israel was willing to give away Arab portions of the city, he wanted it to give away Jewish portions as well!  He falsely says that the Camp David accords would have split the Arab portion of the Levant into \\"Bantustans.\\"  And he boasts, incorrectly, that all non-Jews in Jerusalem would vote to be part of a new Arab state, and not Israel.  That's plenty of self-serving untruths on his part!<br /><br />In 1938, we could all have demanded that the Czechs admit to crimes that they never committed.  But that would not have led to peace in Europe.  Today, we can demand the same of Israel.  But that will not lead to peace now.  Instead, I think we need an Arab willingness to face up to the past and to tell the truth.  And I think we need a big apology from many Arabs.

I'm curious to see how many antizionists will, realizing how bad she makes them look, claim that she is a Zionist plant.<br /><br />Given the title, I wondered if the book might be innocent and humorous.  But it turned out otherwise.  The author says she is concerned about human rights.  It seems to me that if she gets her way, she'll get rid of those rights.  Here's some of what she says about Israel:<br /><br />\\"The State of Israel has a racist ideology in Zionism, happily played the role of modern colonial oppressor, and bullied the Middle East.  Israel represents all that is evil in the world today.  All freedom-loving individuals with a sense of human rights and social justice are ethically obliged to hate the oppression and injustice that Israel perpetuates and executes.\\"<br /><br />This puts Gandhi-Ganesh at odds with me.  I'm a Pagan and a Polytheist.  And I am a strong supporter of truth, justice, and human rights.  That's why I am a Zionist.  Zionism is simply Jewish nationalism.  As such, it demands human rights for all, including Jews.<br /><br />The author tells us that Zionism is racist and oppressive.  But that's a lie.  She then argues that non-Jews do not belong in Israel, which makes it racist.  But that's not true either.  She also falsely accuses Israel of threatening World War Three, and she falsely accuses Zionism of being responsible for the mass murder of Jews in World War Two.  Overlooked in all this is the right of people, even if they are Jews, to live on this planet and to move to new homes.  I would make this right even stronger when the homes are in the homeland of that people, where the main language is of that people.<br /><br />Gandhi-Ganesh then says that Israel oppresses Catholics and Muslims.  Wow.  Considering the difference in sizes of these groups and the historical record, that's like saying that a weak lynch mob victim is the one who is oppressing the lynch mob.  She praises the anti-Israeli stance of the Vatican.  She praises \\"resistance\\" to Israel by the Arabs.  I wonder what she thinks of the German National Socialists, and their willingness to, um, stand up to the Jews just a little more than six decades ago.<br /><br />She's a Hindu, and I would have hoped that she would be against bigotry by the Catholic Church.  But that bigotry is directed against Jews and against Israel, so she likes it.<br /><br />Her history of the conflict is way off.  She implies that there was a Levantine Arab state which was destroyed by modern Israel.  But there wasn't.  She says that Jews could have returned to Jerusalem after 70 AD, but chose not to.  In fact, Jews always found ways to return to Jerusalem.  After all, it was the Jewish capital, and they found ways to keep a presence there, no matter how strongly they were persecuted.  And in the 1870s, Jews became a majority in Jerusalem, even though there were very few Jews in the rest of the Levant.  By the time of the UN partition of the British Mandate, Jews were a bigger majority in Jerusalem (which the UN wanted to set aside for ten years as a neutral city), and Jews were a majority in the Jewish portion of the partitioned Mandate territory.<br /><br />The author says that Arabs are magnanimous, have always treated the Jewish minority in the Levant kindly, and are willing to share land, while the Jews are stingy.  That's false.  She implies that the Israeli Jews are some sort of fanatical demons, whose only desire is to launch a suicidal attack on innocent Levantine Arabs.  But in fact, allowing Jews to have rights would not infringe on the rights of Arabs.  And the truth is that the Jews simply want to exist and want to have the rights of life, liberty and property.  They came to the Levant and worked hard to make the land more valuable, draining swamps and making the deserts bloom.  Peace and cooperation would be a bigvictory for the Jews and they know it.  That's what Gandhi-Ganesh is fighting against.  And she loves to single out the Israelis for condemnation, while dismissing all charges against those who are real problems.<br /><br />Some people mention that there has been a long history of attacks on Jews by European Christians.  So does the author.  But she has the nerve to boast about it!  Rather than conclude that all this bigotry is counterproductive, she concludes that Jews ought to give up now!  Well, if a big and wicked gang were after me (or, say, against all Pagans), intent on depriving me of my property, liberty, and life, I would not give up.  Even if the odds were against me, I'd try to find some decent people who could become allies.  And one day, we might fight back and even win equal rights for ourselves.<br /><br />Gandhi-Ganesh has a closing chapter about bullying.  That is topical.  I can not stand bullies.  And I will not apologize for my opposition to lies, injustice, and tyranny.  I'm more than a little annoyed to see the arrogant way in which the Arab world, often with the support of the European Union and much of the rest of the international community singles out Israel, bans Jews from living in much of the Middle East, boycotts Israeli goods, lies about Israel in the media, bans Israeli athletes from the Mediterranean Games, applauds anti-Israeli terror, teaches anti-Israeli lies in schoolbooks and college texts, and threatens Israel for daring to exist and for permitting Jews to have human rights there.<br /><br />The author is a bully who is taunting those who support social justice and human rights.anesh is fighting against.

It begins by showing some wonderful pictures of sea otters and telling about their ultradensely furry waterproof coats.  A sea otter can wander onto land, but it is very clumsy out of the water.  It may spend its whole life in the sea.<br /><br />About 300 years ago, there were over 150,000 sea otters, maybe twice that many.  But there was extensive hunting which reduced the population to one or two thousand.  In 1911, the remaining ones were protected under the Fur Seal agreement.  Now, the population is back to 150,000.  They tend to live off the California coast, off Vancouver Island, off the Aleutians and off the Kuriles.<br /><br />Sea otters don't like deep water, because they want to find food on the sea floor.  And they prefer a depth of only about 75 feet, although they can dive twice that deep.  We get to see photos of sea otters at lunch, and of some of the food available to them.<br /><br />We also are told of how the sea otter has fared in its interactions with humans.  We've hunted them, and threatened them with atom bomb tests and oil spills.  But now they seem to be doing better.  I think it would be a terrible shame if we were unable to protect these marvellous creatures.	2005-07-13

It has ten interesting articles.<br /><br />As a polytheist who is strongly against monotheism but also strongly favors human rights and Zionism, I was curious to see whether anyone regarded what I consider neutral views as anti-semitic or philo-semitic.  I also wanted to see the logic of a couple of people whose works I've always considered anti-semitic.<br /><br />The first article is by Irwin Cotler.  He explains that there are four basic trends in modern antisemitism (this was written before the 2000 Arab attacks on Israel).  First, classical antisemitism has been finding its way back into political discourse and popular culture.  Second, holocaust denial has been a major tool of the antisemites, and it has been used not only to taunt Jews but to attack human rights as well.  Third, delegitimization of Israel has become a new form of antisemitism.  Fourth, \\"human rights\\" and the United Nations are being used as part of this antisemitic assault.  Cotler points out that a world which is unsafe for Jews will be unsafe for other minorities as well as for democracy or human rights.<br /><br />The second article is a fine one by Bernard Lewis, showing how antisemitism has increased in the Middle East.  The next article, by Skip Porteous, discusses antisemitism among those of the Christian Right, mostly involving stereotyping and aggressive missionary activity (presumably regarded as antisemitic due to the emphasis on Jews as targets).<br /><br />In the fourth article, Joshua Muravchik discusses Black antisemitism.  I think it is counterproductive for one minority to be fooled into opposing minority rights for another minority.  The fifth article, by Cherie Brown, talks about the psychological impact of antisemitism on Jews.  And the next article, by the American Jewish Committee, attempts to soberly assess the extent of antisemitism in 1996.<br /><br />The seventh article, by Naim Ateek, is fascinating.  In it, someone I would consider a blatant antisemite claims that antisemitism is bad and is caused by Israel.  He says that \\"Israel has done a great disservice to God.\\"  And that it \\"has done a disservice to humanity.\\"  And that a big fraction of Israeli land is \\"confiscated\\" from Arabs.  Obviously, he'd consider me a total antisemite.  I think he's projecting, big-time.<br /><br />In the eighth article, Richard John Neuhaus argues that much of Christian America is not antisemitic.  As near as I can tell, this is consistent with some Christians, both on the Left and on the Right, being very different in that respect.<br /><br />The ninth article is by Joseph Sobran, who argues that Christians ought not be blamed for antisemitism.  But I think this misses the point.  A fundamental aspect of antisemitism is the bullying, the lies, the taunts, and so on.  These assaults are on a group that is perceived to be different and weak.  While Sobron does not blame the Jews per se for antisemitism, I think he does whitewash the extent to which Christians (and especially Christian leaders) have been part of the problem.  In addition, he downplays the extent to which Jews regard Muslim antisemites as being a problem as well.<br /><br />In the final article, Alan Dershowitz argues that assimilation is more of a problem than antisemitism.  I have to disagree.  After all, antisemitism is an assault on human rights of life, liberty and property.  Assimilation is very different.  Sure, Jews could all be assimilated.  But this would be a big problem only if they were assimilated into a society that behaved badly.  My emphasis is on truth, justice, and human rights.  Assimilation is bad only if it threatens one of these.<br /><br />I think that were we to use force to get rid of a nation, such as France or Italy, and use assimilation as a tool to permanently rid society of the Italians or the French, we'd be doing something counterproductive.  The same would be true if we gotrid of Israel.  However, Dershowitz argues that something is wrong with assimilation of Jews into American society, and I think this goes too far.<br /><br />I recommend this book.g with assimilation of Jews into American society, and I think this goes too far.

There's even a Jewish state which is sovereign over some land.  That sounds fine to me.  But are the Jews too greedy?  Have they asked for too much?  Is it, perhaps, a crime for Jews or Israel to exist at all?<br /><br />Scott has nothing against the existence of Jews.  And, to his credit, he does not make fun of Arab threats to Jewish rights.  Nor does he always find fault with Israel for defending itself.  But he does regard it as fundamental that \\"Jerusalem belongs to the world\\" and certainly not to Israel.  That seems rather arbitrary to me.  He's not so eager to deprive any other nation of its capital city!<br /><br />The author also asserts that the \\"need for a Jewish haven\\" is not all that great or important.  And he fails to disagree with a statement he claims has been made about the creation of the modern state of Israel representing \\"international lawlessness on a scale heretofore not imagined.\\"<br /><br />Scott is way off here.  Hebrew-speakers are a people, just like Hungarian-speakers or Italian-speakers.  Such a people is a nation whether it has land or not.  And while there are a few countries that are more crowded than Israel, Israel is indeed land-poor.  Israel's Jews, if permitted to do so, would buy even more land.  It is not arbitrary to allow Israel to exist.  What would be arbitrary is a ruling against the right of Jews to buy land and have property rights on it.  And it is not a crime to demand rights to life, liberty and property.<br /><br />The author seems to argue that the Jews can't win, because sooner or later the Arabs will defeat them.  This already sounds arbitrary: if the Jews lose, we shrug and say the Arabs were stronger.  If the Jews win, we taunt the Jews, saying the Arabs will get them next time.  After all, the Jews won one.  The Arabs will win one.  What is fair is fair!<br /><br />But all this overlooks the fact that some disputes are settled in peacetime.  The Jews may indeed lose.  But in the long run, most groups tend to acquire something close to the amount of land they can and do outbid all others for.  Who are we to say that the Jews are special exceptions, doomed to be cheated forever?  It is like saying that at the beach, there will always be low tide, and never high tide.<br /><br />I find this book biased, and I do not recommend it.ng close to the amount of land they can and do outbid all others for.

171527:US	53071109	R24B01J70ZHU6H	1889323128	276813140	Chess Openings for Black, Explained (A Complete Repertoire)	Books	5	11	20	N	N	An excellent chess opening repertoire book	This is a fine repertoire book that will be useful to a wide variety of players.  In theory, anyone with a rating from 1400 to 2400 (that means practically everyone) could use this book to help them adopt this repertoire (Accelerated Dragon, Nimzo-Indian, Bogo-Indian, and Symmetrical English).  And the book is helpful to those who want to play against these openings.  The book is well-written, with a huge number of diagrams (actually, I might have preferred more material and less diagrams).  The book is comprehensive enough so that it will get you through the opening relatively safely most of the time.<br /><br />I think this book is most helpful for those who want to play people rated between 1800 and 2200.  These are players who can picture the chessboard and play a game blindfold.  They can pose a tactical and strategic threat.  They often play openings for White in which one Black error can give White a huge advantage.  That means that a repertoire book has to tell you how to avoid the major traps in a line.  It also ought to get you to avoid lines in which White has a simple strategic attacking plan that pretty much plays itself.  Such lines require almost no preparation by White and require precise defence by Black.  If you are weaker than your 1800-2200 foe, your chances with Black are not good in such a line.  Even if you are stronger, your chance of being upset is annoyingly large.<br /><br />That is exactly what this book will help you with.  Yes, you will play the Sicilian Defence if you follow its repertoire.  But not the Dragon, in which White can push that King Rook Pawn in a Yugoslav attack (or even confuse the issue with e5 in the Levenfish).  Or the Najdorf, where White has a huge number of dangerous sacrificial lines.  You won't have to face a Keres attack against the Scheveningen.  Or a Velimirovic attack.  You won't even be playing the Sveshnikov.  Nor the Sicilian Four Knights, which is a good system but can get you into a tricky isolated pawn position in which White has too many good choices.<br /><br />No, you'll be allowing a Maroczy bind.  And that is relatively safe, given the alternatives.  It ought to work pretty well.  In short, this looks like an ideal book for teaching you how to beat me.  I usually play 1 e4.  I play the Open Sicilian.  And the last thing I want to see from my opponent is an Accelerated Dragon.  Oh, I'll probably play an early c4.  But I'd feel much better against an opponent who is not prepared to face it.<br /><br />Sure, I could play something else against the Sicilian, such as 2 c3 or 2 Nc3 or 2 f4.  But I wouldn't.  And this book has some good advice for how to handle them.<br /><br />I sometimes play 1 d4.  After 1...Nf6, I could play 2 Bg5, the Trompowsky.  This book has some reasonable advice about what to do here, of course.  But I think I would instead play against the Nimzo-Indian with 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Bb4 4 f3.<br /><br />Still, no matter what I played with White, I'd be at least 100 points worse off just because my opponent would know how to avoid my most dangerous lines while still being able to meet what I did play.<br /><br />Obviously, you have to follow developments in these lines if you want to play the repertoire.  As some other reviews have indicated, plenty of folks will try lines such as 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 g6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nc6 5 Nc3 Bg7 6 Be3 Nf6 7 Bc4 0-0 8 f3 (the book gives this move an undeserved question mark) Qb6 9 Bb3 Nxe4 10 Nd5 (the book only considered 10 Nxe4?).  I'm not all that thrilled with this line for White, but obviously, you need to be up to date on errors or improvements in your repertoire.<br /><br />I looked through my own games to see if any of them were, in effect, against this repertoire.  And I found one!  Let it serve as an Awful Example of what can happen to you in the Accelerated Dragon if you misplay it with Black:<br /><br />1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 g6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nc6 5 c4 Nf6 6 Nc3 d6 7 Nxc6?!

And yes, people are getting killed on both sides.  But this fight is about human rights.  I've no idea if anyone will win.  But I do suspect that those Arabs who insist that Jews and other non-Muslims in the Middle East must be denied human rights are going to have to change their ways.  Or else get hurt badly, and probably not by some small nation like Israel.<br /><br />Motro, however, is more concerned with the morality of the Israeli victims.  To me, that is not a very interesting question.  Moreover, I think an overemphasis on this question tends to fit right in with propaganda that the Israeli victims are in fact the villains.<br /><br />Motro knew Jamal al-Dura on a first name basis, so she has plenty to say about the death of Mohammed al-Dura.  But I think she misses the whole point of the incident.<br /><br />The truth is that it is unlikely that Israelis killed Mohammed al-Dura, and even less likely that Israelis killed him on purpose.  It is likely that Arabs killed al-Dura and quite possible that the entire incident was staged.  While Motro mentions some of these possibilities, she pretty much dismisses them without cause.  Worse, she fails to mention a couple of things that we can all be completely sure of:<br /><br />1)  No matter what actually happened in the al-Dura case, plenty of anti-Israeli propaganda is simply staged events.<br /><br />2)  Accounts of actual deaths of Arabs will almost always be twisted by Arab propagandists so that Israel will be blamed, with no doubt or reservations expressed by the propagandists, no matter what the facts are.<br /><br />These are the lessons we all need to keep in mind.  After all, we humans fare poorly when cut off from truth.  If we're ever going to stop the warfare in the region, we'll need to value truth far more than we do now.<br /><br />Motro makes the same mistakes with regard to Rachel Corrie, a supporter of Arab terror who died in what appears to have been an accident.  The author wonders why Israelis were not outraged by Corrie's death.  I think she would have done better to wonder why Corrie had not been expelled from Israel much earlier, both for her own safety and for the safety of the Jews she came to Israel to hurt.<br /><br />Once again, even if Corrie's death had been murder, that would not have proved that some Arabs are right to want to eliminate Jewish rights in the Middle East (or that some Germans were right to want to do the same in Germany seventy years ago).  Plenty of people get killed in wartime, and it would be a surprise but not a shock to discover that one or two out of a number of deaths that were previously thought to be accidental really might have been murders.<br /><br />Motro mentions some antisemitic incidents in Europe.  That includes the \\"Snow White\\" display (which praised a suicide bomber) in Sweden that so annoyed the Israeli ambassador to that country.  And it includes the bad reputation the BBC has in Israel.  Motro shows how far she is from reality when she asks if the problems with the BBC stem from Israeli bad deeds or poor Israeli PR!  Obviously, I think the answer any reasonable person would give is \\"neither.\\"<br /><br />It's too bad that Motro is not an Arab.  After all, she does have a tendency to discuss facts on all sides of the issue.  Where she falls down is in her overall assignment of blame.  And I think this is caused in part by a huge overemphasis on asking what Jewish Israelis such as herself could have done differently.

But which part of Maui is best?  The western part is a little wetter and a little cooler, so some folks prefer the rest of the island.  But I like the western part best, and this book shows, in over 300 color images, some of the reasons.<br /><br />After a brief section on Wailuku, we get to see the Iao Valley, including the famous Needle and some waterfalls.  Then we're off to the beach at Maalaea Bay and the Pali Road to Lahaina, through the Pali tunnel, and along beaches, canyons, and sugar cane fields.<br /><br />There is a long section on Lahaina itself.  We see the 12-foot high Buddha.  And the famous Banyan tree.  And the harbor, and Front Street, and the shoreline.  There are photos of flowers and fruit from the region.  And the region includes some of the central rain forest, only a few miles inland, which many tourists fail to visit.<br /><br />Kepler then takes us north to Kaanapali, with its resorts, beaches, and golf courses.  The book concludes with a mention of Kapalua and the far northern part of the island (Napili Bay, my favorite, is pretty much overlooked), as well as 34 photos from other parts of Maui.<br /><br />I recommend this book.	2005-07-09

I sure did.<br /><br />I agree with the title.  With so much oppression to fight in the world today, why waste one's time applauding oppressors who fight Israel?  But do the Geneva Accords basically supply the parameters of a deal, as Lochery states?  I doubt it.  I think a Levant that could accept those accords would already be at peace.  I think the Geneva Accords would do more harm than good.  I think a Mediterranean that has never allowed Israel to so much as participate in the Mediterranean Games is not ready for peace negotiations at all.  And I think Lochery underestimates the need for truth and human rights to resolve this conflict.<br /><br />The author makes some interesting statements.  He says that international powers, by denying strategic victory to either side, have prolonged the conflict.  I think this denial of strategic victory has indeed been part of the problem.  Lochery also makes the point that Britain's refusal to allow Jews into the Levant was bipartisan.  In 1946, the Labour Party was in power, and it behaved very badly.  But even Winston Churchill, in Opposition, agreed, in a speech on August 1, 1946, that it would be \\"silly\\" to try to help solve the \\"Jewish problem\\" by allowing lots of Jews into the Levant.  As Lochery says, \\"the Zionists survived, and indeed flourished, despite the actions of the British.\\"<br /><br />Lochery says the Arabs ought to have accepted the 1948 Partition Plan, which was more than fair to them.  While that is true, he ignores the fact that rejecting that Plan was an Arab goal in and of itself.  The author then says that Israel was not \\"innocent\\" following the 1948 war because it did not return land it gained nor did it allow refugees to return.  Lochery wanted Israel to make \\"meaningful concessions\\" for peace here.  I disagree completely.  Israel had nothing to give, but even if it had, concessions would not have brought peace.  Considering how desperately Israel needed peace, these are very strange statements from Lochery.<br /><br />The author says that Israel's strategic planning tends to be short-term.  And he says that the term \\"peace process\\" is simply a \\"disguise\\" for lack of progress towards peace.  I think he may be on the right track on these statements, but I'm not sure I agree.<br /><br />Lochery says that anti-Semitic propaganda in Arab lands is dangerous and may lead to the Arab world resembling Germany of the 1930s in this respect.  And that Israel in 1967 was a victim of aggression that was forced to fight.  I agree with the author on both counts.<br /><br />We then read that the 1990s were a decade of Israeli concessions which \\"when taken together came close to amounting to a collective form of national suicide.\\"  And that the U. S. State Department has not learned \\"the lessons from the disastrous Oslo peace process.\\"  Lochery continues by telling that the mere signing of peace agreements is not a method to bring an end to violence and bloodshed.  I tend to agree, but I think Lochery underestimates the amount of pressure Israel was under, and that he underestimates the desire of the U. S. State Department to put pressure on Israel, right or wrong.<br /><br />I like the fact that Lochery realizes who the bullies are.  As he declares, \\"it is the schoolyard bully who continues to dominate in the world of international conflict.\\"  And I agree with him that we all need to stop regarding these bullies as the moral equals of their victims.<br /><br />I disagree most with the author on a set of five lessons he thinks he's learned from the Oslo disaster:<br /><br />1) Secret diplomacy is good!<br /><br />Really?  It didn't seem to work well in the Oslo case.  One benefit of a democracy is that counterproductive ideas have a chance of being weeded out in the open.<br /><br />2) Interim agreements are good!<br /><br />Again, I didn't see it work well in the Oslo case, and I think such agreements risk being very counterproductive when peace is not in the offing.<br /><br />3) Personal trust between enemy leaders is good!<br /><br />I don't buy this either.  I'm always worried to hear that some wicked dictator is felt to be trustworthy.  I'd rather see deeds, not staged smiles.<br /><br />4) External parties must not be guarantors!<br /><br />Actually, this is the one area where I think external parties can help, just by being honest evaluators of whether agreements are being kept and threatening those who break them.  Of course, in the Oslo case, external parties often did the opposite.<br /><br />5) An economic peace deal must underpin any political deal.<br /><br />If the Arabs are willing to live in peace with their neighbors, I think there will be a big peace dividend in any case.<br /><br />In spite of all this, I still recommend the book.not in the offing.    3) Personal trust between enemy leaders is good!

So I tried getting this book to relearn some of the language before going back to Hungary this year.  It helped me do just that, and I was able to converse with plenty of non-English speaking Hungarians.  This is a well-written book.<br /><br />But how much will this book help you if you don't know Hungarian at all?  I'm not so sure.  To communicate in a language, I think you really need to hear it spoken and painstakingly learn a bunch of vocabulary words (I like using flashcards to do this).  I think it will be more of a help to those who already know something about the language, or at least have access to someone who can help them practice it.<br /><br />I'm glad I got this book.  I recommend it.	2005-07-05

He tells of his growing up in South Africa and joining the air force there after World War Two broke out and France was defeated.  And of his flying missions in Italy in World War Two as a South African member of the RAF.  After luckily surviving this, he went on to become a member of the Irgun and then the Haganah (switching in large part because the Irgun had no air force).  He became one of the first pilots in Israel's air force.<br /><br />As Senior relates, the Israeli air force did not get off to an auspicious start.  On May 15, 1948, when hostilities began, the entire Israeli air fleet was arranged in neatly parked rows on either side of the Sde Dov airport.  They were hit by four waves of Egyptian Spitfires (two of the waves struck before most Israelis knew what hit them).  Thus, the Israeli air force was badly damaged in the first hours of the war.  Nevertheless, the Israelis rebounded from this terrible day.  Perhaps its most glorious time came at the end of the war, on January 7, 1949, when the Israeli pilots shot down five RAF planes without any losses of their own.<br /><br />I highly recommend this interesting book.	2005-07-04

It covers the years 1984 to 2002, during which time the author served as a part-time soldier.  And, of course, there was plenty of violence in the region during that time.<br /><br />Watzman did not like the idea of Israel's presence in the disputed West Bank, a region which has an overall Arab majority.  Nor did he like the fact that Jews often justified Israel's presence there on the basis of religion, not for practical reasons, or on the basis of justice or human rights.  And while I disagree with that politically, he's the Israeli, not I.<br /><br />Still, I found it interesting to see what Watzman thought about the idea of refusing to obey illegal orders.  Clearly, one can be given orders that need to be disobeyed for moral reasons.  But disobedience is risky and it lets down one's comrades (by making everyone less trustworthy).  He was lucky: he never got an order that, by being out of line, put him to that test.  But that may not be true of everyone.  As the author reminds us, it certainly is not true of Arabs who have received orders to murder Israeli civilians at random, as suicide bombers.  And Watzman is confident that he would disobey such an order, whether he were a Jew, an Arab, or anyone else.<br /><br />When violence broke out in September, 2000, much of the world's media refused to admit that Arabs were responsible for it.  Was that a triumph of Arab propaganda, or of media bias?  Maybe.  But it was not a total triumph.  After all, the morale of Israel's soldiers could have been a serious issue.  However, that morale was sky-high.  Watzman explains why.  Israelis across the political spectrum had no doubts about who the bad guys were.  Arafat had overplayed his hand.  Saying that no Jewish temple ever stood on the Temple Mount sure was fun.  But it was the icing on the cake for those who had seen Arafat turn down very significant proposed Israeli territorial concessions.  Arab demands to destroy Israel with violence and the \\"return\\" of Arab \\"refugees\\" were also unambiguous.  Watzman's company was united.  Religious issues were secondary compared to the need for defend the citizenry.  All agreed that they had to fight back.<br /><br />I recommend this book.iolence and the \\"return\\" of Arab \\"refugees\\" were also unambiguous.  Watzman's company was united.

That could be true.  And perhaps we ought to worry about whether the rest of the world will head in the same direction, or whether we'll be in conflict with it.  The author also says that borders between states will become much fuzzier.  I'm not so sure I agree with that, but it's an interesting hypothesis.<br /><br />Kaplan then takes on democracy.  Was this just a temporary fad for our society?  Again, maybe.  He emphasizes that democracy is \\"value-neutral.\\"  If society has inherent flaws, democracy merely serves as a mechanism to let these flaws be expressed.  Actually, I disagree somewhat.  I think democracy results in more responsibility and has some other advantages as well.<br /><br />The analogy Kapaln makes here is one I never would have dreamed of.  He asks why Christianity's triumph in the fourth century did not result in a consensus that would lead to peace!  But I think that's absurd.  I don't see why anyone would have expected Christianity to accomplish anything positive in this regard.<br /><br />The author, in the same essay, examines elements of our own society, including basketball games at the University of Arizona, contests which he depicts as gladitorial.  Well, if that's the worst he can say about our society, I think we're in good shape.<br /><br />There's an article on mass murder, which he says that idealism will not stop.  I agree with that.  But I do think that our civilization can do much more to inhibit genocide than we're doing now.<br /><br />Kaplan emphasizes political realism in inhibiting war.  As he points out, whenever the international community has attempted to avoid war at all costs, it has quickly found itself at the mercy of its most ruthless members.  He agrees with Kissinger in warning against people convinced of their moral superiority.  And he reminds us that tyranny is a form of disorder posing as order.<br /><br />As a sidelight, he notices that some revolutions truly involved abrupt political changes, such as the French revolution of the 1790s.  Others, such as the American revolution in the 1770s or the Zionist one in the 1940s, merely confirmed evolutionary changes that had been in the works for quite a while.<br /><br />A final issue Kaplan deals with is the value of the United Nations.  He thinks that a truly muscular international organization is undesirable, and would be stultifying.  I think it would be tyrannical!  He says the UN represents the illusions, not the hopes, of \\"millions\\" of people.  I think the biggest threat the UN and other international organizations pose may to scholarship.  Tyrannies don't like truth.  But truth is a value, and a tyrannical world will make everyone miserable, not just because we'll all lack freedom but because we'll be so much worse at dealing with life in general.<br /><br />This book gives the reader some things to think about.

She thinks the reason there is violence in the Levant is that Jews, using a \\"rapidly eroding\\" argument, feel they have to maintain a Jewish majority in Israel.  She notes that some Jews are passionate about this.<br /><br />Well, I am a liberal.  And a polytheist.  I am for human rights.  I am for peace.  I would like nothing better than for the people of the Levant to live together in peace.  Not only that, I think it would not be peace to ban Arabs from Israel or to ban Jews from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Gaza, the Golan, or the West Bank.  I think it would be a mistake (and again, not peace) to \\"ethnically cleanse\\" regions by expelling Arabs from Israel or expelling Jews from the West Bank.  Matter of fact, I would like it if both sides let Pagans live in the region as well, and granted us human rights.  Furthermore, I agree with Tilley that the Jewish settlements in the West Bank might be tough to remove.  Maale Adumim and Ariel in particular are big towns.<br /><br />Some folks say that a two-state solution is needed.  Um, which two states?  Two Arab states?  Two Jewish states?  One of each?  There really isn't much land there.  Israel, even including the West Bank and Gaza, is less than 11,000 square miles.  The remaining Arab states have millions of square miles of land.  11,000 square miles is in fact not enough for either a Jewish state or an Arab state.  While that land has plenty of coastline, it doesn't have oil.  A few million people would, in time, buy up much more than 11,000 square miles.  If we want two states, we'll need to find much more land for them.  That fits right in with Tilley's argument: one state on 11,000 square miles is plenty.  Dividing it up would render it less valuable to everyone and be a threat to peace as well.<br /><br />However, Tilley fails to realize that Israel itself is land-poor.  To her, the over 5 million Jews in Israel are inherently insufficient to be a majority in 11,000 square miles of Israel, while the millions of square miles of Arab lands are not really enough for the Arabs!  That is preposterous.  In peacetime, Jews would dominate that most or all of that 11,000 square miles, and probably buy up another ten or twenty thousand square miles as well.  An actual Arab majority in Israel would signify to me that something bad probably had been done to the Israelis, just as an Arab majority in Italy would signify to me that something bad probably had been done to the Italians.<br /><br />So I can't agree that we all need to realize that there is something wrong with Jews being a majority in Israel!  As for the passion that Tilley says some people show on this matter, well, I think it is proper for people to be passionate about having rights to life, liberty, and property.<br /><br />That gets us to the second big thing that is wrong with Tilley's entire concept.  She seems to regard a binational state as a great new idea.  It isn't.  It was the original idea.  It did not work.  And the reasons why it didn't work are just as valid today as ever.  Back in the 1920s and early 1930s, most Levantine Jews wanted the British Mandate to become just such a state.  Jews would have rights of life, liberty, and property.  They would be allowed unlimited immigration to the new state.  Hebrew language and culture would be officially recognized (Hebrew and Arabic could be dual national languages).  Jewish religious rights would be protected.  Holy sites of all people would be protected and be open to all.  And the Jews would have their own schools, universities, and hospitals.<br /><br />Arab fanatics made sure that none of this could ever happen.  The final blow came when Arabs convinced the British government to issue the infamous 1939 White Paper.  That took away the right of Jews to immigrate, condemned hundreds of thousands of Jews (or more) to death in Europe, and made it clear that for Jews to have rights in the Levant, a Jewishstate was a necessity.  Tilley, by wanting to remove the elements of this state that allow Jews to have these rights, is being an outright opponent of human rights, not just for Jews, but for everyone.<br /><br />There are some other problems with the book.  Tilley complains about Jews ravaging the land and threatening the water table.  I think that is misleading.  The Jews have worked wonders with Levantine land in the past century or more, draining swamps, irrigating the deserts, using water efficiently, and making desalinization so inexpensive that it may permanently answer any long-term threat of catastrophic Israeli water shortages.  If any group has traditionally ravaged Levantine land, it has been the Arabs.  A single state might help fix that problem, not by reducing poor Jewish practices as much as by reducing poor Arab practices.<br /><br />I think Tilley may be right that one state in the Levant is enough.  But I think that state ought to guarantee human rights for Jews, including rights of immigration, not preclude them.<br /><br />I do not recommend this book.he Levant, a Jewish state was a necessity.

In it, the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), which I feel is a major opponent of human rights, is praised and is portrayed as supporting human rights!  Universities are advised to divest from Israel, an act which I consider a blow not only to peace, justice, and human rights, but also a racist attack on truth and scholarship.  Israel's \\"failure to comply with United Nations resolutions\\" is used to condemn not the UN, but Israel.<br /><br />There's an interview with Noam Chomsky, who seems to feel that just because America conquered some land which is now part of our country, and just because Israel defended itself against some attacks, it is unjust for America or Israel to exist today.  That is totally absurd.  A better way to analyze such situations is simple: ask who would own what if nobody had committed any crimes or acts of violence.  The obvious answer should come as a shock only to a few fanatical antizionists: Americans would own America and Israelis would own Israel.  We Americans got into fights over land that we would have bought anyway, sooner or later.  And Israel got into fights over land it either already owned or would have bought, and it lost some of that land in those fights.<br /><br />This arbitrary treatment of the Arab war against Israel reminds me of a test proposed by Edward Alexander: are those who demand rights for others willing to demand the same rights (not more, not less) for themselves, or for their own people?<br /><br />One after another, Chomsky, Steve Quester, Joel Koval, Norton Mezvinsky, Ora Wise, Norman Finkelstein, Phyllis Bennis, Adam Shapiro, Daniel Boyarin, David Weiss, and Marc Ellis join Seth Farber in flunking this test.  Some are explicit about it.  For example, Boyarin says one has to \\"take care of the poor behavior of your own people before you worry about the poor behavior of other people.\\"<br /><br />If anyone who called me one of their people said that \\"we\\" should ignore violent attacks on me and instead investigate accusations (probably by my attackers) of bad behavior on my part, I might start to question my relationship to that person!  But whether I did so or not, that person would be taking a completely arbitrary stand.  A total outsider would be exposed as being arbitrary at once for ignoring crimes by one side in a dispute.  Claiming to be a member of one of the two sides does not grant one immunity from any of this.  Refusing to consider the crimes of one of the sides is arbitrary no matter who does it.<br /><br />Still, arbitrariness is not the only problem with the book.  Even the advantage of being able to describe a war as though only one of the sides is actually fighting is not enough for the contributors to this book.  In addition, they simply come up with outright misinformation.  And that bothers me.  This book is unscholarly.  It is antischolarly.  And its falsehoods serve to support terrorism.<br /><br />Such an approach absolutely destroys any faith I might have that I am dealing with people who are willing to sincerely deliberate issues of public policy.  Basically, unless they stop feeding me intentional untruths, I won't consider any of their recommendations.<br /><br />If there were just a few mistakes or exaggerations, I might let that go.  But that's not the case.  The book is misleading almost all the time.  I'll give what looks like an innocent example.  It would be innocent if it occurred just once or twice.  But not when it is one of many famous untruths that have been heavily cited and criticized by honest people.  Norman Finkelstein talks about the fact that Jews only owned 6% of some land when Israel became a state.  He implies that Arabs owned the other 94%.  Hmm, 94% sounds bigger than 6%.  Maybe the Arab claim to the land was even better than that of the Jews!<br /><br />But this is all nonsense.  Jews outnumbered Arabs in the portion of the British Mandate that the United Nations put in the Jewish partition.  It wasn't 6% Jewish.  The majority were Jews (in spite of enormous efforts made by Arabs and British to keep Jews out of land the League of Nations had given Jews a right to settle in).  And while only 6% of the total British Mandate soil was Jewish private property, most of that soil was state land!  The Arabs didn't own much of the land either.  You may want to check for yourselves what the actual amounts were, both in the entire Mandate and in the Jewish partition.<br /><br />Almost every sentence is like that.  The contributors know what they are doing.  They feel that if they tell the truth, they have no case.  That may not stop them from coming up with books like this one, but it certainly ought to stop us from recommending them.6% Jewish.

But to me that is like asking for cake when one is unable to get bread.  Israel exists precisely because its neighbors have been in no mood to allow the Levantine Jews to have rights.  Israel has not been the party to wish for anything other than clear and friendly borders.  Its neighbors are the ones who have demanded that.<br /><br />The author says she wants to support human rights.  But if Israel's neighbors were willing to abide human rights, the issues she comes up with would be easily resolved.  Few people would care about the details of border locations if people had rights of life, liberty, and property on both sides of those borders.  Issues of immigration, justice, and security would also be resolved easily.<br /><br />The tough part is trying to figure out how to get Israel's neighbors to accept the idea of human rights, or, failing that, how to make the best of not being able to achieve such a goal.  Golan-Agnon doesn't have any answers here.  Instead, she concentrates on how Israel can appease its most reactionary neighbors.  That is not a new idea, but it certainly is inconsistent with any support for human rights.<br /><br />I do not recommend this idiotic book.	2005-06-11

And maybe that's a good way to start thinking about the topics in this book.  Walzer asks us some tough questions right away.<br /><br />Try this one first.  Should liberals be tolerant of totalitarian groups within their society?  There is no easy answer.  If we rule that some religious parents have no right to raise their children in religious schools we would be saying, in effect, \\"We're tolerant!  We're liberals!  We tolerate all liberals!  And we don't tolerate others, but so what ... they're different than us!\\"<br /><br />Obviously, that won't do at all.<br /><br />If we go to the other extreme, and tolerate everyone, no matter how much of a threat they are to our society, that won't work either.  If we smugly decide to do something in between these two extremes, that means being arbitrary rather than following easily applied principles.<br /><br />Walzer concludes that when \\"political power is at stake, we should tilt decisively against the totalizing groups,\\" just for the sake of decency.  But he reminds us that this is merely a guideline.  \\"It doesn't solve the problem of day-to-day coexistence.\\"  Such problems require \\"a long and unstable series of compromises.\\"<br /><br />The author also talks about involuntary associations, such as family or cultural group.  Are we morally obliged to defend our families or cultural groups if they are attacked?  Walzer thinks we generally are.<br /><br />Walzer also asks about the concept of deliberation.  That's different than debate, which is simply a contest in which one tries to win, even with an unsound argument.  Deliberation involves trying to make as good a decision as possible about what policy to pursue.  Here, the author points out that liberal societies debate thinkable policies with great freedom.  But they also define what policies are thinkable, and those which are not simply don't get brought up.<br /><br />A final topic is passion in politics.  Do we want our villains to be cold and calculating?  Or wild and frenzied?  Do we need more passion or less?<br /><br />I guess I disagree with the author here.  Any human is likely to be passionate enough about any interesting issue, the more so if there is widespread debate about it.  As a liberal, I'm not afraid of fickleness on social issues.  I'm not afraid of having kids disagree politically with their parents.  But I am afraid of people going overboard and taking dubious and illogical political positions, unsupported by facts, which they then passionately refuse to reconsider.<br /><br />In any case, the author has some good ideas, and I recommend the book.and frenzied?

But if you want just one repertoire book on the Scandinavian, I'd recommend getting the one by Emms instead.  Both books have plenty of good material.  But the one by Emms has more recent games, and Emms comes up with more suggestions for Black in what I feel are some key lines.<br /><br />After 1 e4 d5, White can play 2 e5, 2 Nc3, 2 Nf3, 2 d4, or, of course, 2 dxe5.  Few books spend much time on 2 e5.  Plaskett, to his credit, does spend three pages on 2 Nc3.  I think a repertoire book on the Scandinavian ought to say something about 2 Nf3 and 2 d4, but neither Plaskett nor Emms give these moves any real space.<br /><br />When White plays 2 exd5, White can play 2...Qxd5 or 2...Nf6.  I play the latter move.  But both Emms and Plaskett spend plenty of space on 2...Qxd5.  Their emphases are different, though!  After 3 Nc3 (both books mention 3 d4 as well), Plaskett has 8 pages on 3...Qd8, 11 pages on 3...Qe5+, only 21 pages on 3...Qa5, and 51 pages on 3...Qd6.  Emms has 2 pages on 3...Qd8, 3 pages on 3...Qe5+, 74 pages on 3...Qa5, and only 9 pages on 3...Qd6.  By the way, if you want to play 3...Qd6 you may want to get the book on it by Michael Melts as well.<br /><br />Of course, you may play what I think is the objectively stronger move, 2...Nf6.  Both Plaskett and Emms have some good material on 3 Bb5+.  But the two moves you'll generally face are 3 d4 and 3 c4.<br /><br />3 d4 may be the strongest White move.  Black can play 3...Nxd5, the main line, and come under some strong White pressure.  Or Black can try the possibly unsound Portuguese Variation, 3...Bg4.  Plaskett has 38 pages on the Portuguese, and if you play it, I think you may want to get Selby Anderson's book on it as well.  However, I don't play the Portuguese, and I think Emms has better advice on how to survive in the 3...Nxd5 lines.<br /><br />3 c4 is the other main White try.  It tends to transpose into the Panov-Botvinnik attack against the Caro-Kann.  But Plaskett lets us down by not covering the Panov at all, while Emms at least has an interesting recommendation for Black after 3 c4 c6 4 d4 cxd5 5 Nc3 e6 6 Nf3 Bb4.<br /><br />I prefer not to defend against the Panov-Botvinnik attack, and I generally prefer the move ...e6 to ...c6, so I play the Icelandic Gambit (1 e4 d5 2 exd5 Nf6 3 c4 e6).  Plaskett spends 15 pages on this, while Emms has only 8 pages, but I prefer Emms' treatment.  Both Plaskett and Emms agree that 4 dxe6 Bxe6 5 Nf3 is the most dangerous try for White.  But while Plaskett simply recommends avoiding the gambit with Black, Emms at least tries to offer a playable line with Black, namely 5...Qe7 6 Qe2 Nc6 7 d4 Bg4.  That's what I think is best.  Surprisingly, neither Plaskett nor Emms look at the line Andrew Martin recommends in \\"Secret Weapons,\\" namely 5...c5 6 d4 cxd4 7 Nxd4 Bc5 8 Be3 Qb6.<br /><br />Still, I like this book and I enjoyed the writing style of the author.ose into the Panov-Botvinnik attack against the Caro-Kann.

Now he addresses the issue of neoconservatism.  He does not \\"argue that Bush is a puppet of the neocons and Cheney/Rumsfield.\\"  As the author says, the top Bush officials are not neocons.  And Bush seems to have come up with ideas on terrorism and Iraq on his own.  But Dorrien does criticize neocons for their dreams of Empire, their annoyance with the United Nations, and their hawkishness.<br /><br />Is Dorrien right?  Do neocons want the United States to be an Empire?  What do neocons think of international law?  More precisely, do neocons want the United States to be fair, or do they want us to throw our weight around to get our way?<br /><br />I think the author makes some good and bad points on these issues.  The problem is that we need to start with a couple of fundamentals.  Political disputes, say between liberals and conservatives, involve agreement on some goals and disagreement on the means to achieve them or the nature of successfully meeting them.  That is, most of us want American society to be just, fair, and prosperous.  That could be a mutual goal.  We could have totally different political ideas about what that goal might mean.  Still, we would be speaking the same language, even though we disagreed.  Those who wanted American society to be damaged or destroyed would not be able to truly agree or disagree with any of the rest of us.<br /><br />Now where do I think this places those with some specific political views, such as the neocons?  Well, I think some neocons might indeed want the United States to be unfairly biased in helping Americans rather than others.  But they surely would not want to put it that way in a debate!  Matter of fact, they would much rather put the shoe on the other foot, and be able to argue in favor of justice, fairness, and human rights for all against those who are explicitly against them.  And that leads to what I call \\"litmus test\\" issues.  It seems to me that the neocons have picked some issues of this sort.  Dorrien recognizes this, as he points out that one neocon, Norman Podhoretz, has emphatically criticized Communism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Americanism.  But Dorrien implies that these issues tend to separate the neocons from the liberals or paleocons.  I think that misses the point.  I think issues such as Iraq, Korea, and Taiwan might do a better job of drawing such lines.  Communism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Americanism are, in my opinion, issues that neocons want to use to draw the line between being able to join the debate or not being able to do so.  Those who strongly favor Communism, anti-Americanism, or anti-Zionist terror really are not in a position to constructively criticize liberals, paleocons, or neocons.<br /><br />Dorrien does realize that neocons are sincere about these issues.  If they are wrong, he encourages us to address their arguments rather than speculate about their motives.  But he merely explains that these issues are important.  He fails to address the question of where the line is between such issues becoming national in nature and merely being a facet of partisan politics.<br /><br />I'm a liberal, and I am often in disagreement with neocons, on tactics, strategies, and goals.  And I think we ought to oppose dubious or arbitrary American policies.  I think we Americans can pursue a better foreign policy.  But that certainly ought not mean supporting Communism, anti-Zionism, or anti-Americanism.  I think Dorrien agrees with this.

First, there is a failure to admit that the Arab side refuses to accept Israel as a Jewish state.  Second, there is an unwillingness to assign responsibility for deaths caused by armed Arabs who strike from within an otherwise unarmed crowd.  Third, there is a failure to recognize the effect on Arabs of systematic education in schools and in the media to idealize terrorist acts of murder and mayhem.  Fourth, there's a tendency to describe terrorism and the war against it as if they were the same thing.  Fifth is the pretense that sypathizers with Arab terrorism are the most reliable sources for news.  Sixth is misleading reporting of events, as if responses to terror are the problem.  Seventh is refusal to condemn terrorism or even call terrorist acts \\"terrorism.\\"  Eighth is refusal to recognize that Jews living on the West Bank are human beings.  Ninth is abiding by Arab wishes in reporting, in order to avoid being threatened and to be rewarded with scoops.<br /><br />We see people call Israeli attacks on major terrorists \\"illegal executions,\\" but a nation has a duty to protect its citizens from murderers.  The author explains that some Europeans react this way due to fear of Islam, shame at what Europe has done to Jews, and a \\"need to justify past crimes by criminalizing the Jews.\\"<br /><br />Some people complain that if they criticize Israel, they are taken to task for it.  But Nirenstein explains that much of this criticism is not lucid.  If someone says that Israel kills children and journalists on purpose, and calls Jenin a slaughter, Nirenstein labels that person an antisemite, just like the antisemites of old that many of them now pretend to hate.<br /><br />We are shown the constant lies and taunts, the demonization of Jews, the denial of rights to Jews, claims that no Jewish Temples ever existed, claims that there never was a Holocaust, and so on.  The author says these are an integral part of the action, not merely background to it.  And there is a substantial discussion of the demonization of Jews at the well-named Durban racism conference in 2001.  Nirenstein also provides an interesting interview with would-be suicide bomber.<br /><br />The author concludes that to defeat antisemitism in Europe, education is needed in four major areas.  First, that the purpose of demonization of Israel is to incite violence and terrorism.  Second, that ignorance of the history of Israel and Zionism are essential for this demonization to work.  Third, that grief for the deaths of Jews in no way implies any willingness to save Jews who are still alive.  Fourth, that the Arab terrorists are not in fact victims.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.xisted, claims that there never was a Holocaust, and so on.

There were articles on the need (or lack of need) for Israel, whether Israel treated Arabs fairly, whether the United States ought to support Israel, and on Israel's international role and future.  Now, in 2005, the Greenhaven Press has come up with a new (albeit noticeably shorter) book on Israel.  It continues in the same fine tradition.  There are all sorts of viewpoints here!<br /><br />The book starts with a couple of articles on Israel's right to exist.  However, nations do exist, and for reasons.  I think it is silly to say a nation has a right to exist, and even more absurd to say that a nation has no such right.  In any case, Yaron Brook and Peter Schwartz make the point that the Arabs who want a new Levantine state do not want freedom but the right to attack Jews.  If America appeases such demands, it will make matters worse.  Meanwhile, Ahron Cohen says that Zionism annoys Muslims and must therefore be abandoned, with Jews returning to their prior relationship to Muslims (dhimmihood).  Those of us who support human rights are unlikely to be convinced.<br /><br />Given that nations have features that differentiate them, it is easy to argue that Israel ought to be Jewish.  And the Kinneret agreement does just that.  But Joel Kovel argues that such an Israel would fight for Jewish exceptionalism!  In fact, getting rid of Israel's Jewish nature would make Judaism truly exceptional, and result in a special lack of rights just for Jews.<br /><br />Tony Judt argues that Israel was formed only in 1948, and that is too late!  That's preposterous.  He calls Israel (but not any other state) a \\"dysfunctional anachronism.\\"  But that is simply an attack on human rights by Judt, as Jonathan Rosenblum points out.  After all, the Arab nationalism that opposes Israel is far more virulent and exclusivist.  I agree.  The threats to human rights that made Israel a necessity in the first place are still present.<br /><br />James Inhofe argues that Israel rightfully belongs to the Jews.  I think a more convincing case can be made, but he raises some good points.  The Arab counterargument is astonishing.  It simply greedily demands everything.  There is no recognition that other people live on this planet too.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Paul Eisen's article probably has the most misinformation.  It rhetorically asks if Israel's ethnicity is the major obstacle to a just peace.  Well, no, it isn't.  The major obstacle to a just peace is the refusal to abide Israel's insistence on everyone, even Jews, being granted human rights.  Barry Block makes this point more strongly, explaining that Zionism is the national liberation movement of the Jewish people.  \\"Liberating and saving the life of one's own people is not racism.\\"<br /><br />Jonathan Rosenblum argues that no Levantine Arab is above suspicion in the present war.  After all, women and kids are sometimes suicide bombers.  But this raises more questions than it answers.  Obviously, some Arabs want to be law-abiding, and a way needs to be found to distinguish them from those who want to engage in violence against Jews.<br /><br />Patrick Johnston's article argues that Israel is a terrorist state, that Zionists (such as myself) must be declared terrorists, that there must be war crimes tribunals against Israeli leaders, and that the UN must impose harsh sanctions against Israel.  But everything he says against Israel and Zionism can be applied to anyone.  I think one could use the same argument to justify getting rid of all humans.<br /><br />Ziad Asali argues that peace between Israel and the Levantine Arabs is possible, but only on Arab terms.  Basically, those terms seem to be \\"what is mine is mine, what is yours I'll take most of, and the rest we'll share until I want that too.\\"  That's not peace.  David Horowitz correctly argues that peace with the Levantine Arabs is not possible because their only real demand is for the destruction of Israel.  Peace will have to entail that demand being thwarted or dropped.  Don Feder agrees: the advertised \\"two-state\\" solution will not bring peace.  But a George Bush speech is included which indeed advertises just this solution.<br /><br />Uzi Landau argues in favor of the security fence between Israel and the Arabs.  But he also argues that Arabs must continue to be allowed to live in Israel, and that by symmetry, Jews must be allowed to live across the border in Arab territory.  Catherine Cook expresses her outrage that Israel actually claims a tiny amount of land that happens to be heavily Jewish demographically.  If there is a protecting fence, she wants West Bank Jews to be outside it.  But that makes her appear as if she wants those Jews to be murdered.<br /><br />Bruce Thornton argues coherently that all of us who value law and individual freedom ought to support Israel.  Sarah Helm disagrees, asking us to sacrifice Israel to appease Arabs and saying (quite unconvincingly) that Israel is immoral anyway.  Paul Findley blames the 9/11 terrorist attacks on American support for Israel and says that \\"Israel is a scofflaw nation and should be treated as such.\\"  Once again, I feel that if even Israel is a scofflaw, everyone is.  The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs points out that it is Israel's existence, not the status of the peace process, that is the main Levantine issue.<br /><br />Lee Hamilton argues that the United States can help resolve the conflict by getting both sides to recognize the legitimacy of the other.  I disagree, of course, and feel that the Arab side is not a genuine potential peace partner.  Leon Hadar takes a different point of view, and says that the United States should not attempt to mediate, as our most recent attempt simply got both sides to harden their positions.  I disagree with that as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this fascinating book.will have to entail that demand being thwarted or dropped.

This was already enough to accomplish his goal of precluding peace.  The author continues with a fine history of Israel, emphasizing those who, by accepting arbitrary and racist complaints about Zionism as valid, refused to demand for their own people the human rights they demanded for everyone else.<br /><br />Why would people do that?  Lewin says that some Jews have \\"deluded themselves into believing they could win peace through embracing the indictments of their enemies and seeking to appease them.\\"<br /><br />I think the author is right about that.  But I also feel there is more to it than this.  I think that some religious Jews want to avoid taking what appear to be provincial political public stands.  And that some people of Jewish descent are even more reluctant to appear Jewish at all, either religiously or politically.  Meanwhile, we can see in this book that some Israelis, aware that Israel needs peace, feel they have to snap at every piece of bait marked \\"peace\\" offered by anti-Israelis.<br /><br />Israel exists because the British White Paper of 1939 convinced a large majority of Jews, both in the Levant and outside it, that Jewish rights to life, liberty, property in the British Mandate (and immigration to it) could not be protected unless a Jewish state were declared there.  We see the reactions of many folks to those who want to undo all this by having Israel renounce the Law of Return, or by giving non-Jews the right to revoke human rights for Jews in the country.  If the need for Israel to ever be a refuge for Jews no longer existed, and if the threat to Jewish rights were no longer present, there could be a good reason to consider such steps.  But it seems to me, as well as to the author, that these threats are as strong as ever.<br /><br />Levin makes an interesting point about the Camp David talks of 2000.  My view had been that the peace with Arafat was doomed from the start, and I thought that Israel was lucky that Arafat had not agreed to it, signed some documents, broken all his promises, and then blamed Israel.  I winced when Israel made big offers to someone who clearly was not a potential peace partner.  But Levin says that these offers were not entirely counterproductive.  Arafat had hoped that Israel would display the intransigence I had wanted to see.  After that, he would have unilaterally declared a state, and probably obtained recognition from Europe (and possibly from the United States as well).  Instead, as the author explains, Clinton and most of Europe blamed Arafat for the failure of the talks.<br /><br />Levin mentions the Kineret Declaration, which appears to reflect a broad response to anti-Zionist attacks.  It affirms that Israel has the responsibility of being the national home of the Jewish people, that Israel is both a democracy and a Jewish state, that Israel is home to many communities and respects the rights of all its citizens, and that Israel is committed to the pursuit of peace and justice.  I think that is something most Zionists ought to be able to agree on.2000.

It includes some useful references and a glossary.<br /><br />The book starts with an excellent introduction by Oz.  We are told that Pagans accept no dogma, authority, or hierarchy in spirituality, and don't proselytize.  And we see that Pagans show respect for the animate, the inanimate, and the conceptual.  Frey Aswynn then has some good advice on making a personal connection with a deity.  Graham Harvey explains some of the options in Paganism and has some advice for figuring out which one fits you.  The idea is not to choose something to convert to but to discover what you already are.<br /><br />There are chapters on nature, on magic, on the study of Paganism and on rituals.  For some Pagans, the social aspects of religion are the most meaningful, and Tehom gives some advice on working with a group.  Kristin Madden (the dean of Ardantane's School of Shamanic Studies) and others explain the option of being more private (or more secretive) and practicing one's faith alone.  That option does not preclude being a member of a small or large Pagan community, of course, and Madden has a chapter on Pagan communities as well.  In addition, she explains that a parent can teach a faith powerfully by example.  I agree.  Certainly, my mother was a powerful example for me, and I learned from her at an early age what polytheism and religious privacy are all about.<br /><br />Amber K and others tell us about the various ways in which Pagans live, and give advice about organizing one's own group.  Kerr Cuhulain has a good chapter on \\"coming out\\" (of that broom closet).  He advises being prepared before one takes any stand, gives advice about religious arguments (in general, avoid discussing the Bible), explains that Paganism is legal, and has suggestions for dealing with schools and workplaces.  Gus diZerega has a good chapter on Pagans, social responsibility, and politics.<br /><br />When people ask me if I am a Pagan, like Jezebel, Hypatia, Margot Adler, Galina Krasskova, Kristin Madden, Freya Aswynn, or my Mom, I say I am.  But when they ask if I am a Pagan, like Starhawk, I tend to say, um, no.  Starhawk's chapter is on political action.  I think Pagans ought to get involved politically just like everyone else.  Besides, we often agree about a few major issues.  We usually feel that the value of monotheism is exaggerated in our society.  As a minority, we generally support minority rights.  We tend to be anti-authoritarian.  And many of us value and revere nature.<br /><br />But what can I say about my profound disagreement with Starhawk?  My comment is that I think we need to be very careful in choosing political allies, and that fanatical, bullying, chauvinist, right-wing monotheists can be dubious choices.<br /><br />All that aside, I highly recommend this book.and politics. <br /> <br />When people ask me if I am a Pagan, like Jezebel, Hypatia, Margot Adler, Galina Krasskova, Kristin Madden, Freya Aswynn, or my Mom, I say I am.

But it makes some excellent points.  Still, it could be that this book was not really written primarily for a polytheist such as myself.<br /><br />Sper begins by noting that many people have enemies that persecute them.  Some overcome them.  Others succumb.  The Jews have done neither.<br /><br />He then gives an unforgettable example of Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, who berated a starving Jewish girl but gave gifts to the Romans who persecuted her.<br /><br />After that comes a section on Jewish history which I think is a little biased and misleading.  I think Jews often overestimated their strength and suffered the consequences.  In my opinion, Sper also overestimates the potential of the Jews to compete against the Roman Empire.  Still, I think it is worth reading what he says.<br /><br />The author makes a good point about truth: some folks have sacrificed it in favor of convenience.  And that has led to some great absurdities, such as terrorists being called \\"freedom fighters\\" (although the only fighting they do is against freedom) and Yassir Arafat getting a Nobel Peace Prize.<br /><br />Sper discusses the Jewish right to the land of Israel.  He mentions that Arabs left the land desolate.  I think that's a very good point!  Mongols left Russia desolate, and that was a big clue that Russia, not Mongolia, was going to have a better claim to the land.  He also mentions that Arabs have 500 times as much land as Israel.  That means that Israel can afford to buy its land while the Arabs can not afford to buy theirs.  Another good point!<br /><br />Some Arabs say that they want the land of Israel.  But when they did have the West Bank, they used it for little more than a base from which to try to destroy Israel.  I believe that Abraham Lincoln said that those who deny freedom to others do not deserve it for themselves, and Sper surely makes that point as well.  And I have to agree.  Just as the Sudetens forfeited their rights to Czechoslovakia by denying rights to the Czechs, I think Arabs who do not abide rights for Jews have forfeited their rights to Israeli land.<br /><br />The author wants Israel to make use of its strengths and build on them.  That makes sense.  And if one looks at it from the point of view of the Arabs, it makes even more sense.  As Sper says, the Arabs (not Israel) are the source of political instability in the Middle East.  If they can't stop fighting their neighbors, they'll eventually run into opponents who make full use of their abilities to fight back, whether they be Jews or others or both.<br /><br />I agree with Sper that Israel ought to declare some borders and state its case for them.  That would get others to realize that Israel has both a goal and a case to support it.  As it stands, many folks believe that Israel has neither.  And the author correctly points out that there has never been a \\"peace process,\\" only a \\"surrender of land\\" process in which Israel loses land and gets its people killed.<br /><br />I was going to give this book three stars.  But I'm adding one because Sper says that it is a lie that the Levantine Arabs \\"are a unique people, different than other Arabs, and it is a lie that their goal is to build a state.  Their goal, as demonstrated time and time again, is not to build but to destroy, to destroy Israel.\\"  They do not have a constructive national movement.<br /><br />All this is pretty obvious, but very few people have said this in print!

This concept was invoked to prosecute the losers in World War II, at Nuremberg and at Tokyo.  But there are problems with the entire concept.  Definitions of justice are different in different countries.  And there are serious concerns about jurisdiction.  Finally, there are quite legitimate worries about political uses of such a court.  By this, I do not mean a fear of a dubious decision which favors the majority of the world against a single nation.  I mean the fear of a horrible decision that hurts the entire world, in the name of injustice.  That is, we have seen the court system in Germany become perverted in the 1930s and 1940s.  Could the same thing happen to the International Criminal Court (ICC)?<br /><br />Yes, it could.  We've seen the United Nations applaud Arafat.  By the same token, an ICC could try to arrest an American President and try him for totally bogus \\"war crimes.\\"  Obviously, the United States has been worried about having its citizens facing wrongful charges, possibly for the undefined crime of \\"aggression.\\"  In addition, there is a concern that real war criminals may be unprosecutable by the ICC.  If a leader committed genocide against his own people, that would be outside the jurisdiction of the ICC.<br /><br />In Part One, we see the goals of the ICC, which include achieving justice for all, ending impunity, helping to end conflicts, remedying the deficiencies of ad hoc tribunals, taking over when national criminal justice systems are unable or unwilling to act, and deterring future war criminals.<br /><br />In Part Two, we see some objections.  India was puzzled that the ICC gave itself the authority to block trials for war crimes.  And it was clearly upset that it refused to ban any weapons of mass destruction by calling their use a war crime.  Israel was pleased to see the ICC proposed, given that the idea came out of prosecuting those who committed the Holocaust.  But it was more than mildly spooked when the ICC made it clear that it would regard it a war crime were Israel to permit Jews to live in disputed territory or even in Eastern Jerusalem.  Not only was such a plan bad in and of itself, it also served as a precedent: literally anything might be called a war crime.<br /><br />Another article, by David Rivkin, Lee Casey, and Darin Bartram, explains that \\"few notions of justice and procedural fairness truly transcend national frontiers.\\"  In addition, there is the risk of political use against the United States, which would weaken our potential for deterrence and therefore encourage aggressors.<br /><br />There are rebuttals to these concerns, and the entire book makes for interesting reading.  I am not convinced by the rebuttals.  I think the ICC as it now exists is counterproductive.  But read this book for yourself and see what you think.who committed the Holocaust.

A few good players.  A good coach.  And who knows?<br /><br />Anyway, in 1996, Castel di Sangro (no, not Sangria) managed to advance to Serie B in the Italian soccer league.  That meant playing against teams from cities you may have actually heard of, such as Turin, Genoa, Padua, Palermo, Verona, Bari, and Venice.<br /><br />The point of this book is not how Castel di Sangro fought and clawed its way through its first season in Serie B.  It's mostly the humor of the situation.  Not all of it is humor.  Some very unfunny things happen as well.  But this book left me guffawing.  Whether it is about trying to get the stadium ready, or getting a good athlete at midseason, or simply having the author describe travelling in Italy, this book is just plain funny.<br /><br />We watch as a player in a match tries to move the ball six inches away from the spot for a penalty kick.  And as he feigns injury, getting the keeper to come forward to see what the matter is, and then gets up and quickly kicks the ball into the open net.  And we watch a game played in bad weather against Genoa, in which the soccer ball simply sinks, ending the match.  And we get to hear discussions of more serious matters, such as the morality of lynching a referee.<br /><br />I recommend this book.	2005-06-02

And there are some comments about perceptions of antisemitism.  Even here, I think Cragg sometimes is way off base.  For example, he claims that Shakespeare's play, \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" is pro-Semitic because Shakespeare gives Shylock some lines.  I think that's silly of Cragg.  The play is, in fact, casually antisemitic, written for an audience known to be unsympathetic to Shylock's lines, and it agrees with that audience via Shylock's daughter.<br /><br />Cragg has an interesting comment about a fascinating quote from Martin Luther: \\"'We let them eat and drink with us ... we do not kidnap their children nor poison their wells,' making a virtue of habits of hospitality Christians found no occasion to exercise while being libellous as well.\\"  Fine words!  Unfortunately, Cragg has his own set of libels about Zionism in store for his readers.  Whether he is writing about the noble Zionist refusal to commit the, um, ultimate crime of destroying the Dome of the Rock, or about Israelis seeing \\"land or peace\\" as a false choice, or about Ed Said's view of the \\"peace process,\\" or about the Hebrew language, or about love of land, or about the United Nations, Cragg has something stunningly misleading and counterproductive to offer us.<br /><br />The author implies that the land of Israel is a beautiful bride, but she's married to another man (not to the Jews, but to the Arabs).  But anyone can see that Israel has been the most populous and prosperous when Jews have been the majority.  If any people husband her, I guess it's the Jews.<br /><br />If one started by knowing nothing about the Middle East and read this book first, one would never guess that Israel is a land-poor little nation and that the Arabs have a vast Empire.  Instead, one would think that Israel is a major power of enormous independent importance.  And rather than realize that Arab terrorism and propaganda are serious crimes, one would conclude that they are a simply a predictable reaction to the unfairness of Israel's existence.  Cragg not only presents this misinformation, he also implies that it is unchallenged.<br /><br />I think this book reflects very badly on the Anglican Church.East and read this book first, one would never guess that Israel is a land-poor little nation and that the Arabs have a vast Empire.

So it may not be surprising that I enjoyed this book.  But I can recommend it to those who have far less knowledge about it.<br /><br />Suppose you have, say, read Njal's Saga (as I did a few decades ago, when I was a teenager).  Suppose you were outraged, as I was, upon reading about how Hjalti Skeggjason said that either Odin or Freyja had to be a dog.  Suppose you concluded that dismissing the Goddesses and Gods for a nailed corpse did not represent progress.  What sort of book would be a good introduction to Norse, German, and Anglo-Saxon religious practices for you?  Not one that represented the whole idea as an outmoded telling of myths that had been replaced by something better, that is for sure.<br /><br />I think this book, by Galina Krasskova, is the best one.  It does not challenge the fact that polytheism has much to offer all of us.  And it has the enormous advantage of describing the Northern religious tradition from a Heathen point of view.  It is a great introduction with some excellent references for further reading.  It tells us about Heathen lore, and about how Heathenry is practiced today by those who are \\"seeking to restore a spiritual and cultural tradition that was largely destroyed by the spread of Christianity across Europe.\\"<br /><br />The author begins with a short historical overview and a brief explanation of the spectrum of modern Heathenry.  Next is a section on Heathen cosmology, followed by an important chapter on the Gods and Goddesses.  It is indeed refreshing to see a book that capitalizes the pronouns She and He when referring to a Goddess or a God.  We learn what it means to hail a God or a Goddess and get some advice on meditation.  There is a section on devotional practice and another one on holy days.  And we learn the Nine Noble Virtues: Courage, Discipline, Fidelity, Honor, Hospitality, Industriousness, Perseverance, Self-reliance, and Truth.  Perhaps you'll find these suited to you and agree that we are our deeds.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and Truth.

But this book does not criticize liberalism nearly as much as it does the non-liberal policies of some so-called liberals.<br /><br />There is a chapter about the protection of our borders.  Now protection of our borders, language, and culture is actually a national issue, not simply a conservative one.  Similarly, human rights, justice, and truth are national issues, not simply liberal ones.  I think it is better to discuss these issues in such terms.  And to some extent, Savage does so.<br /><br />The author is right that the United States needs to control its borders.  Now, we may disagree signifcantly about some of the details, such as how many immigrants we'll allow in.  But I certainly am not going to recommend that we simply open our borders to everyone (as well as to any nuclear weapons they may be smuggling).  Even if we intend to let in many of those who now enter the United States illegally, I want this done legally, with our authorities in control of our borders.  Savage implies that liberals are too soft on border control, but I think this is unfair, and that border control is a national issue.<br /><br />What about Islamofascism, as Savage quite appropriately calls it?  Are some liberals just a little too eager to whitewash it?  Yes, some are.  But the issues are of truth, incitement, human rights, and sedition, and all of these are national issues.  Besides, fascism is simply not liberal.  I think Savage makes some good points, but they are valid for all of us, across the political spectrum.<br /><br />The same can be said for puff pieces about Arafat.  Savage lives up to his name in relating some of the more revolting paeans to this monstrous mass murderer.  And I think those of us who indulge in coming up with them are not behaving as liberals.  Arafat was not merely a monster, he was also an enemy of the United States and a political enemy of liberalism.  I would have serious doubts about the liberal credentials of anyone who called George W. Bush the greatest President America has ever had.  I have even more serious doubts about the liberal credentials of those who issue similar praise for Arafat.<br /><br />I think we liberals need to read this book.  We've got enough problems trying to drum up support for rational behavior, human rights, equality, freedom, and justice.  We do not need to give ourselves more problems by appearing to fight against our own principles.d for puff pieces about Arafat.

WHERE IS EVERYBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Is there intelligent life in the Galaxy?	Are there any civilizations in the Galaxy that are sending out radio signals besides us?<br /><br />If so, why haven't we detected them?  Why hasn't such a civilization visited us?  After all, our Galaxy has been around for billions of years, but it would take only a few million years to populate it.<br /><br />Webb is thorough in covering possible answers to these questions.  Perhaps they are already here!  Maybe they call themselves Hungarians.  Or perhaps they exist but haven't communicated with us.  The author discusses this all at great length.  And next, he gets into the most obvious possibility: maybe they don't exist.  Maybe we're the only ones.  Or maybe we're just the first of many.<br /><br />Webb discusses the possibility that there are several difficult steps (say, 12) on the path from abiotic material to intelligent life.  Maybe we'd be the only lucky ones who made it through all twelve!  Actually, I think this argument is mildly garbled by Webb, and that the best way for us to be the only ones is for there to be exactly one very unlikely step that could happen at any time (like winning a lottery).<br /><br />There are other reasons why we might be the only ones.  Perhaps there are unusual properties of our part of the Galaxy or of our planet that make our odds much better.  There is a discussion of \\"habitable zones,\\" both of the Galaxy and of stellar systems.  And there is a discussion of hazards to life: another area where we humans may have been luckier than we might imagine.  Webb also writes about how life may have originated on Earth in the first place.<br /><br />At the end of the book, the author gives his own \\"solution\\" to the problem.  Basically, it is that roughly one planet in the Galaxy has communicating life.  Actually, that looks like a very interesting and plausible guess.  But he also estimates that there are 10,000 planets in the Galaxy with complex life.  Or is it 4,000,000?  You see, he sloppily made three arithmetic mistakes in his calculation: factors of 10, 10, and 4.

But this in no way shows what he implies next, namely that systems with critical elements could not have evolved from simpler ones!<br /><br />Evolution is a fact, with an overwhelming amount of evidence to back it up.  And Behe constantly underestimates the power of all this evidence.<br /><br />Suppose people in the far future wondered where airplanes came from.  Did humans build them?  And suppose they eventually uncovered some of the blueprints for an early passenger plane, clearly produced by humans.  And then they found some prototypes of the planes, and the factory that produced them, and so on, until the evidence were overwhelming that humans had built these planes.  Now suppose someone came along and found a later model of that passenger plane and stated that it were obvious that such simple-minded humans could never have designed it.  And therefore that hobgoblins (creatures that have never been shown to exist at all) must have done it!  What would we say to that?  Well, that's what I am thinking about Behe.<br /><br />Behe says, in effect, that since he can't think of a mechanism for the evolution of blood clotting, it never evolved.  That shows more than a little nerve.  Especially when he glosses over many of the clues that are helping folks figure out the answer, such as homologies among clotting proteins.<br /><br />The power of incremental improvement is something Behe ought to know better than to underestimate.  But he nevertheless goes after Dawkins for giving an example of how incremental improvement quickly produces a line from Shakespeare.  Now, it is true that a line from Shakespeare does not confer a competitive advantage, so it isn't the greatest example.  But there are sequences in nature which do indeed give a competitive advantage.  And I can confirm that incremental improvement, where the best single modification is chosen at each step, is incredibly powerful.  Behe is totally wrong here.<br /><br />What bothers me most about all these questions Behe asks is that he has no countertheory.  \\"Intelligent Design\\" is not a theory; it is an anti-theory.  Behe wants to argue that there was an intelligent designer.  But who designed his designer?  We're losing ground here, and Occam's Razor is going to, um, give Behe some nasty cuts, I think.<br /><br />In any case, this leads the author into a discussion of design philosophy.  And here, he discusses the Big Bang.  Behe explains that some folks never liked the Big Bang because it seemed philosophically weak.  And that it was too religious.<br /><br />Well, there is plenty of evidence for the Big Bang, especially the obvious products of the nucleosynthesis that occurred in those very early and hot few minutes.  Yes, it looks philosophically weak to say that the Universe originated out of nothing.  And even more provincial to say that Existence began less than 20 billion years ago (less than five times the age of our little home planet).  However, there is plenty of potential philosophical justification for a Big Bang, and my guess is that most philosophers will soon be happy with it, just as most are now happy with evolution.<br /><br />I tend to be a fairly sceptical person.  I'm actually annoyed by Behe's implication that Darwinian evolution is an example of dogmatism, and that we all need to be more open-minded so we can reject it.

Books	5	9	10	N	N	Informative and fun to read	This is a well written book, and it has plenty of fascinating material. Ruse begins with a discussion of what \\"purpose\\" is. That means understanding that causes precede effects. And it means understanding that objects can have purposes: a watch can have a purpose, namely to tell time. A bread knife can have a purpose, namely to cut bread. And so on.<br /><br />But what is the purpose of, um, the planet Jupiter? Or of Niagara Falls? We soon see that inanimate objects can be purposeless. And when we look at animate objects, such as eyes or entire creatures, we see that these can fail to have any overall purpose in a Darwinian world.<br /><br />Ruse then gets to the issue of complexity. Does apparent complexity of some entities show that they have purposes? No. And he shows how Hume argued that apparent complexity in the world may be deceptive.<br /><br />I wish that Ruse had spent some time on the following argument against design: who designed god? If god didn't need to be designed, why did the observed universe need to be designed? If god needed a designer, was that designer bigger, tougher, and more complex than god or weaker and simpler? And who designed the designer that designed god? But Ruse spares us what I think is actually a good set of questions here.<br /><br />Ruse then discusses Darwinian evolution and adaptation. And we see some interesting examples. There's a fine discussion of male-to-female ratios at birth and the connection to survival and reproduction. \\"High ranking\\" females of some species have more male offspring (consistent with the idea that such offspring will do well in competing for mates) while \\"low ranking\\" females have more female offspring (consistent with the idea that almost all females will reproduce).<br /><br />We also get to read about behavior that seems only partially adaptive, such as the breeding of dunnocks, as well as the tomography of some square-shaped bacteria in saline pools in the Sinai.<br /><br />Those of us who read books about evolution often see design used as a metaphor. Ruse discusses this. It isn't so much that we're using the language of Design. That's fine if such language is appropriate. But is it? And in some cases, it certainly makes sense.<br /><br />The book concludes with a chapter on \\"Intelligent Design.\\" Ruse politely demolishes some of the arguments made by some of the modern proponents of this outdated idea. And he also talks about Dawkins, who claims that Darwinism is a major challenge to religious belief. Is Dawkins right? Well, yes, he is. It is indeed a challenge to religious belief. And Ruse makes the point that one can argue in favor of religious belief anyway, but not by arbitrarily dismissing either Darwin or Dawkins.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book, and I recommend it.us who read books about evolution often see design used as a metaphor.

But is this a full-time opening or merely a surprise weapon?<br /><br />It can be used as a full-time opening, and this book shows us how.  But I use it as a surprise weapon.  And there are two reasons why one might want to use it this way.  One possibility is that you play 1 d4 regularly and want to avoid 2 c4 against a well-prepared opponent.  Another is that you rarely play 1 d4 at all.  Perhaps you want to surprise an opponent with a Blackmar Gambit after 1 d4 d5, but Black plays 1...Nf6.  Now what?<br /><br />As Nigel Davies explains, there are several ways to play this opening.  I first tried it over thirty years ago, after reading about a game between Hort and Hartston which began 1 d4 Nf6 2 Bg5 c5 3 Bxf6 gxf6 4 d5 Qb6 5 Nd2 (5 Qc1 is often preferred nowadays) 5...Qxb2 6 e3 f5 7 Rb1 Qf6 (7...Qxa2 is risky) 8 Bd3.  White won that game fairly easily.<br /><br />But what if your opponent doesn't let you take the Knight?  Well, after 1 d4 Nf6 2 Bg5 Ne4 3 Bf4 d5, I'm sure you'll understand why I play 4 f3.  I'm heading into a Blackmar Gambit!  After 4...Nf6 5 e4 dxe4 6 Nc3 exf3 7 Nc3, I'm actually a tempo up in the Blackmar, and getting ready to play Bc4, Qe2, 0-0-0, and d5 to break open the position.  Davies explains how to play all this, and he also shows the line where White plays 4 Nd2 instead of 4 f3 (recommended by Andrew Martin in \\"Secret Weapons\\").<br /><br />We also see lines with 3...c5 instead of 3...d5.  Here, 4 f3 is the most popular move for White, but I don't like it.  Instead, I prefer 4 d5.  That way, I get the same position as when Black plays 1 d4 Nf6 2 Bg5 c5 3 d5 Ne4 4 Bf4 Qb6 (although I pass up my opportunity to grab that Black Knight).  And in this position, I play 5 Nd2.  The book shows a game with this move, as well as games with 5 Qc1 and 5 Bc1.  And it gives us some games with 2...c5 3 Bxf6 gxf6.  When I face the Trompowsky as Black, I play 2...c5, and this book has some great advice on how to play both sides of this.<br /><br />Well, what else can White expect to see in this opening?  There is a chapter on 2...d5.  After 3 Bxf6 exf6 4 e3 Bd6 what should White do?  Andrew Martin, in Secret Weapons, suggested 5 c4, but Davies doesn't like it at all, preferring 5 g3.<br /><br />There is also a chapter on 2...e6.  Black then plays 3 e4 h6 4 Bxf6 Qxf6.  Andrew Martin recommends this for Black in \\"Trashing the Tromp.\\"  White can play 5 Nf3, a move this book does not even consider (Martin looks at it in Secret Weapons).  But the standard move is 5 Nc3, which Anand played against Karpov in a FIDE World Championship knockout match.  Karpov played 5...d6 (Martin recommends 5...Bb4 in Trashing the Tromp) and lost.  Davies also examines 5 c3, which is the move I like for White here.<br /><br />And yes, there are a few other options for Black.  In many opening books, we see some minor line tried by some, um, minor master (or weaker player) against a World Champion.  The World Champion wins, and the conclusion is that the line is no good.  But who knows?  We'd be more convinced if we saw a World Champion lose with the minor line!<br /><br />Anyway, the game Davies picks to show the minor line 2...d6 is Adams - Kasparov (1993).  And yes, Adams won that game, giving me every reason to suspect that this entire line is weak for Black.<br /><br />This is an excellent and up-to-date book.  I recommend it for anyone wanting to play either side of this opening.how to play both sides of this.    Well, what else can White expect to see in this opening?  There is a chapter on 2...d5.

But there is a typo in the title.  The actual title has the words \\"United Nations\\" not \\"United States.\\"<br /><br />The United Nations surely has been exposed as counterproductive in its mishandling of conflicts.  And one of the most obvious examples involves Israel.  The UN failed to protect Israel when it was invaded in 1948 by five Arab states.  Instead, it merely sent a negotiator who proposed that Israel cede Jerusalem to the Arabs.  The UN failed to help resettle Arab refugees.  Instead, via the UNRWA, it kept them for decades in camps that promoted terrorism.  The UN failed to protect Israel in 1967, pulling its peacekeeping forces from the Sinai.  When Arafat tried to visit the UN in 1974, did the UN have him arrested, tried, and executed?  Um, no.  Instead, it let him address them and applauded him!  The UN passed the preposterous \\"Zionism equals racism\\" resolution in 1975.  In 1981, the year this book was originally published, the UN voted to \\"deplore\\" the extradition of an Arab murderer, Ziad Abu Eain, from the United States to Israel.  And so on.  The UN has been perverse at best in this conflict.  I can't imagine anyone having the nerve to defend the UN on all this.<br /><br />Well, the author does not defend the UN here.  He criticizes it for not giving more support to the thugs who wish to expel, ban, rob, slander, murder, and otherwise oppress Levantine Jews.<br /><br />Nuseibeh complains that injustice is being done.  It is easy to see that!  In a just world, the Jews would be allowed to live in peace and buy land and keep it.  Of course, such a world would be \\"color-blind\\" and not applaud racists who find it natural to oppress non-Arabs.<br /><br />The author boasts that Arabs settled the Levant 5000 years ago.  That's not true, but it would be irrelevant even if it were true.  Who cares who owned the land then?  What matters is that some Arabs want to steal some of it now.<br /><br />It is relevant that Jews wanted to buy land in the Levant and live in it, and that they outbid everyone else for plenty of land and moved there.  It is relevant that they made good on their purchases by draining swamps and making the deserts bloom.  That is what got them the land: paying top dollar to outbid others and then finding a way to make staying there profitable.<br /><br />Nuseibeh mocks this entire history, dismissing the Jews as destroyers of the land when in fact it is the Arabs who ran down the land.  The Jews are the ones who raised land values.<br /><br />The Arabs are responsible for getting the British to issue the notorious White Paper of 1939, which closed off the Levant to Jews who tried to flee Europe.  That paper resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Jews or more, and it completely violated the terms of the British Mandate.  That paper convinced the Levantine Jews that a Jewish state was a necessity if Jewish rights to life, liberty, property, or immigration were to be protected.  But the author dismisses all this.  Nuseibeh also dismisses British support for Arab attacks on Jews in 1948.  It is as if the Jews that fought the British for their independence were just demonic monsters that wished to die.  But if Jews are such suicidal demons, why did they come all the way to the Levant, buy all that land at high prices, and work so hard to make the deserts bloom?  Oh, we're not supposed to ask that!<br /><br />The whole book is like this.  It assumes that the reader agrees with the racist idea that Jews are sub-humans who must not be allowed to own land, have rights, or live near real humans.  It assumes that the West Bank is not disputed land but eternally owned by Arabs, no matter how often the Arabs may sell it for high prices!  It pretends that Jerusalem was an Arab town until 1967, when in fact it had a Jewish majority since the 1870s and is the most traditionally Jewish town in the region.<br /><br />In 1938,some people asked if the Czechs were above the law.  Could they really be allowed to live in Czechoslovakia?  After all, the Sudetens were not going to vanish!  But the Czechs do indeed live in the Czech Republic today.  The Germans have mostly gone back to Germany.<br /><br />In this book, the author asks if the Israelis are above the law.  That's hilarious.  The Israelis would like nothing better than to have equal rights for all humans in the region!  Israel would stay on the map, and Jews would have human rights!  Israel would prosper, and the whole region would be better off.  But if the Arabs insist on denying human rights to their neighbors, I think they risk the fate of Germany in the 1940s or worse.  Eventually, those who deny rights to others will get into a fight they will lose.<br /><br />There are over five million Jews in Israel now.  And there are Jews in the Diaspora who might well move there were there peace.  I would expect Arabs to be happy to allow Israel to exist on less than 11,000 square miles, given all this.  Instead, we see way too much racism and greed, and this book is a great example of it.gion. <br /> <br />In 1938, some people asked if the Czechs were above the law.

But it gives me a chance to show that I can be generous, and give five stars to any book that makes a serious effort to inform its readers.  This book does that.<br /><br />Sure, it made me gulp when it claimed that both the Jews and Arabs believed that they \\"had the right to the entire territory.\\"  Um, really?  Anyone can see that the Jews saw it as their right to buy land and live on it, not to expel Arabs, while many Arabs appear to have fought for the right to ban, expel, rob, slander, oppress, and murder the Jews.  There is a big asymmetry here!  And that asymmetry is even greater when one considers the fact that Jews were indeed banned from Saudi Arabia and even Jordan (actually the bulk of the original Mandate!) but still did not consider returning the favor by banning Arabs from their fifth of the Mandate.<br /><br />The book often misses a chance to show just how greedy many of the Arabs were being in demanding rights to all Jewish land.  But it does report on the bulk of Israel's history in a reasonably accurate manner.<br /><br />One problem one has in discussing the history of Israel is that there are a great many highly dubious Arab complaints about Israel.  These complaints are manifested in absurd UN resolutions and in statements to the media.  What does one do about it?  If one dismisses the most ridiculous accusations, one appears to be taking sides.  If one does not dismiss them, one is being misleading, and making it appear that the more outrageous UN resolutions against Israel reflect badly not on the UN but on Israel.<br /><br />I think the book could have been much better in addressing all this, but it did report the reaction of both sides as soberly as it could, and it did let us readers draw our own conclusions.<br /><br />One last comment.  I know it is a tiny point, far less important than any other, but I simply have to make it.  Israel is the only Jewish state.  Were the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva still in Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem), I would have been surprised to see it adorn the cover of this book.  If there is a book about France, I expect to see something French on the cover.  If it is about Hungary, I expect to see something Hungarian.  This book is about Israel, and the Dome of the Rock is not really the most Israeli thing, and certainly not the most Jewish thing that I can think of.  Quite the contrary.<br /><br />I can imagine the reaction that I would have were a book about my country to show some edifice that was not merely of a different people but of a people that were at war with my nation and were bullying my nation.  I'd feel provoked.  I'd be asking myself if it might be a good idea to tear that edifice down, so I wouldn't be seeing my country pictured this way.  And that's a really bad idea.<br /><br />If I were an Arab, I would still feel provoked.  But now, I'd be wondering why, instead of showing that Israel is sovereign over something Jewish, it implied that Israel was sovereign over an Arab edifice!  And I'd be asking myself if it might be a good idea to get total sovereignty over the place, so nobody would show it as part of Israel any more.  And that is a really bad idea too.<br /><br />I think this book (and a few others) ought to be faulted not so much for showing this picture, but for showing only this picture on its cover.a (Jerusalem), I would have been surprised to see it adorn the cover of this book.

And I was not disappointed.  It shows the same careful and thorough approach.<br /><br />It begins by showing the legacy of Saudi extremism, slavery, racism, bigotry, intolerance, and chauvinism.  And then we get to the subject of oil money.  That money, combined with King Faisal's preoccupation with Jews and Zionists (whom he saw as evil) was a toxic mix.  It resulted in pressure on Aramco as well as on the United States government directly to try to help change American foreign policy in the Middle East.<br /><br />Of course, for the United States to abandon an ally in that region would have unpredictable but almost certainly fairly serious and negative consequences.  So when the Arabs attacked Israel in 1973, the United States soon found itself aiding its ally, much to the displeasure of Saudi leaders.  And we see the result of this displeasure: boycotts, embargoes, Saudi funding of terror, and Saudi contributions to American universities (in an obvious attempt to promote the teaching of Saudi racism here).<br /><br />Posner also shows us some of the American response to this.  There has been plenty of American timidity, especially in the State Department.  But there has also been an anti-boycott law, as well as some state condemnations of Saudi intolerance.<br /><br />This is a well written book and I highly recommend it.	2005-05-21

It tells about Muslim history, Muslim religious life, Islamic art, and Muslim society.  It is a useful reference.<br /><br />Normally, I would give such a reference five stars.  But there are three outstanding questions.  Namely, just how tolerant is Muslim society of non-Muslims?  How tolerant is Muslim society of human rights?  And how tolerant is Muslim society of truth?  These are absolutely fundamental questions.<br /><br />These questions could have been asked of European society in the year 1200.  Or German society in 1935.  And it ought to be asked about Muslim society today.  After all, we can see from this book that this society is well-organized and has the power to do plenty of good.  But it can also be quite destructive, and self-destructive.  What does this book say about that?<br /><br />Not much.<br /><br />This book glosses over the problems Islam has had with human rights.  It barely mentions the problems with dhimmihood.  It discusses the status of women, but steers clear of taking a stand on the topic.  In short, the book finds it easy to glorify anything about Islam that looks nice, but just can't bring itself to criticize anything about it.  After some reflection, I've decided that this is a serious failing.<br /><br />If this were the year 1935, and there were a book that had a similar difficulty in finding any fault with German society or leadership, would I give it five stars?  I hope not.<br /><br />Both Islamic society and human society as a whole need to respect the rights of others and value truth if they are to prosper.  Now, how does the Muslim world view the West?  How does it view minorities in its own lands?  How does it view a small non-Muslim neighbor, namely Israel?  Let's see what the book has to say about the latter question.<br /><br />\\"Nothing brought home the continuing inferiority of the Muslim position more acutely than the existence of the state of Israel,\\" says the book.  We find that this feeling was \\"exacerbated by the constant flow of immigrants,\\" by what it calls the \\"expansionist aims of some Israelis\\" and by the \\"humiliation\\" of Arab armies in the wars of 1948, 1956, and 1967.  All this without explaining how these wars occurred!  Again, what if a book about Germany had said such misleading things in 1935?  Would I have given that five stars?  Again, I hope not.<br /><br />The book goes on to explain that Muslims everywhere take the war against Israel seriously.  Well, if that is true, Muslim society has a big problem.  Societies that base their existence not on trying to improve the lives of their citizens and becoming more prosperous but instead focus on aggressive wars against their neighbors are deserving of substantial criticism.  Surely there is more to Muslim society than a goal of oppressing others!  And I think that a book of this sort ought to point to ways in which more positive goals can be supported.<br /><br />This book is good at much of what it does, but it falls down badly when it comes to topics such as human rights or truth.constant flow of immigrants,\\" by what it calls the \\"expansionist aims of some Israelis\\" and by the \\"humiliation\\" of Arab armies in the wars of 1948, 1956, and 1967.

It reminds me of another fine (but much older) work, namely \\"The Art of Controversy,\\" by Arthur Schopenhauer.<br /><br />McInerny starts right out with recommendations on how to communicate.  Avoid evasive language!  Pursue truth!  And he explains that truth is divided into ontological (existence) and logical (valid statements).<br /><br />We then get to principles of logic.  These are identity (a=a), excluded middle (a either exists or it does not, not both or neither), and sufficient reason (everything has a cause).<br /><br />The author tells us some of the causes of illogical thinking.  These include overskepticism, evasion, cynicism, naivete, narrowmindedness, emotion, insincerity, and lack of respect for common sense.  And, of course, as in \\"The Art of Controversy,\\" there is a section on forms of illogical thinking.  One of the more interesting ones involves precedents.  Obviously it is a fallacy to say that just because there is a precedent of something having been done before, it is a good idea to do it again.  But the author shows how this fits in with the dubious claim that \\"two wrongs make a right.\\"  Of course, to claim that because it was wrong to do something in the past, it is wrong to do it now would be yet another fallacy.  I think the author could have expanded on the question of precedents here.<br /><br />I recommend this book.	2005-05-20

But it does take quite a few shots at France.<br /><br />In general, it is not a good idea to toss around this kind of criticism.  Criticism can rebound, and it can lead to unnecessary friction among nations.  Still, I think this book is at a reasonable level.  France does deserve some criticism for its behavior.  And that criticism is directed not at the French people in general, but at the leaders.<br /><br />Typical of the criticism is a comparison of France and North Korea.  Which one trades with China?  Which has nuclear weapons?  Which is a threat?  Which is an enemy?  Both?  It's all quite amusing, but there is a solid undercurrent of truth to all this criticism.  Besides, we know we are reading a polemic.  This book says so right up front.  The book makes the boast \\"Truth in advertising!\\"  And Boyles points out that Le Monde is not equally honest about the nature of its articles.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, especially if you've always liked France.	2005-05-18

It starts with historical material, including the refutation of ancient \\"spontaneous generation\\" theories by Pasteur.  We then get to the Darwinians.  Haeckel in particular felt that inanimate matter made a transition to a living system in an evolutionary manner.  In the 1920s, Oparin and Haldane speculated on the organic components and atmosphere that might have been present on the early Earth.  And Fry tells us of the Urey-Miller experiment of 1953.<br /><br />Next we find out about the contributions of Sidney Fox, who suggested a model that started with abiotic material and then generated amino acids, condensed them to form \\"protenoids,\\" and then formed cell-like \\"microspheres.\\"  This was a \\"protein-first approach.\\"  That is contrasted with the \\"gene-first approach\\" and accompanying experiments by Spiegelman, Orgel, and Eigen.<br /><br />There is a discussion of the \\"RNA world\\" and whether or not there was a world of earlier self-replicators.  And Fry gives arguments for and against the ideas of Freeman Dyson (with the emphasis on primitive cells), Stuart Kauffman (with the emphasis on \\"catalytic closure\\") and Gunter Wachtershauser (with the emphasis on Iron Sulfide chemistry).<br /><br />Fry is at her best discussing the need to ask if life originated by a series of likely steps, by design, or by one or more unlikely steps.  She makes it clear that long required sequences simply can't form by pure chance.  There must be some natural ordering (such as in snowflakes) as well as incremental improvement (in an evolutionary manner).  And if we are left with some theories that require some incredible luck and some theories that do not require such luck, we'll obviously prefer the latter.  She discusses de Duve's ideas here.  It seems that a \\"scaffolding\\" approach is a good concept, while autocatalytic cycles may be needed almost by definition (of life).<br /><br />That gets us to the final chapter, where the definition of life is indeed discussed.  In addition, Fry talks about the possibility of there having been life on Mars and elsewhere in our solar system.  There's also some material about habitable zones, and on the possibility of life on extrasolar planets.<br /><br />I recommend this book.hapter, where the definition of life is indeed discussed.

And they tell me about all sorts of physicists who have been avid monotheists (often adding that most biologists know better).  I tell them that there really are Goddesses and Gods, which are perfections of attributes.  But I just get more laughter.<br /><br />Now they can laugh at Unwin, and for good reason.  This book did indeed belong in the humor section.<br /><br />The most serious problems with the hypothesis of a monotheist god are with the self-inconsistent properties.  Not the chance that it actually is well-defined but non-existent.  I could discuss such problems at length.  If god is the First Cause, why didn't god need a cause?  There is a possible reason that might not even violate Occam's razor: god might have been infinitely small and powerless.  But that is not the image of god that Unwin or most monotheists have.  Meanwhile, god is said to be perfect, but there is no such thing as a perfect being.  Perfection at one attribute is the exact opposite of perfection at the opposite attribute.  A god that does nothing wrong can not do anything right.  And it gets worse when we get to god being omnipotent and benevolent.  There is a problem with the existence of evil.  We could, of course, claim that we do not understand what god is up to, but if we do, we find it hard to rule out the possibility of god being evil.  We can claim that god gives us the freedom and opportunity to be evil, and that freedom is good in itself, but then we find it hard to explain why god does not make us more rational.<br /><br />Now, what does Unwin do in this book?<br /><br />He starts with Bayes' Rule, and he explains it fairly well.  This rule is simply arithmetic.  It can't be challenged or denied, any more than arithmetic can be challenged or denied.  And it surely is applicable even to (maybe especially to) questions of origins, deisgn, and the like.  Of course, the inputs to such a rule can be senseless, in which case the outputs can be nonsense as well.<br /><br />The author asks about things we observe in the real world that might be more likely if god exists or less likely if god exists, so that he can apply Bayes' rule.  He views the existence of (and recognition of) good as a plus here.  I'm not so sure about this, even for a well-defined and self-consistent god.  I think we're getting back to a general \\"goodness\\" or \\"perfection\\" here, but I think that \\"good\\" needs a more specific reference than that.<br /><br />Next we get to the existence of evil.  As I already said, that surely is a problem, and Unwin views it as such.  I don't see it as a problem for the Gods and Goddesses, but for a single benevolent god, one has to wonder.<br /><br />After that, there is the argument from miracles.  Unwin tends to dismiss these.  I agree.  I also think it is worth noting that several people have pointed out the following: suppose we all had proof of the resurrection of Jesus (or others).  Would that prove the existence of a monotheistic god?  No.  Would it even be strong evidence for it?  Probably not.<br /><br />Unwin finishes with the argument from religious experience.  And he winds up with two chances in three that god exists.  Pardon me while I giggle.<br /><br />After that, there is a discussion of how we should react to this.  And this includes some material about \\"Pascal's wager.\\"  Pascal claimed that if god exists, we win big by believing in her.  And if god does not exist, we lose nothing by this belief.  But this argument is outrageous.  Unwin is not all that impressed by Pascal's argument either.<br /><br />I feel that Pascal's argument is truly deplorable.  It is like being asked how big we need to make a counterfeit bill before one will accept it.  If you won't take a counterfeit $20 bill, how about a counterfeit $1,000,000,000,000?  Of course, they don't make such bills in real life.  But merely increasing the promised gain does not always make dubious behavior worthwhile.  If you can see that a bill is counterfeit, you won't take it no matter how big it is.  And while one probably can convince oneself to believe in a monotheistic god, and presumably can try to fake out god about being sincere, is it worth it?  What if god punishes those who worship her for this reason?  What if she doesn't exist at all, and you've seriously wasted your time, as well as your self-respect?<br /><br />All in all, I think questions about the existence of the Goddesses and Gods are better treated with logic (and maybe philosophy) rather than with arithmetic.in real life.

But there is no mistaking its seriousness.  We see how a satirical French work which had nothing to do with Jews was transformed by some Russians into a libel against Jews in general.  And we see the history of this fabrication as it makes its way through Europe and World War II, as well as into the Arab world, the Americas, and elsewhere.<br /><br />If there is one thing on this planet that outrages me more than anything else, it is anti-scholarly lies.  We humans aren't worth much without our brains, and our brains are not worth much unless we value truth.  Lies are major causes, in my opinion, of many human misfortunes, including plenty of unnecessary wars.  And I think lies such as the fabricated \\"Protocols\\" need to be exposed.<br /><br />A minor point that occurs to me is that many people call \\"The Protocols\\" a \\"forgery.\\"  While that is certainly true, it can give a few people a misleading impression that there is a genuine Protocols and they are reading the wrong one!  I prefer to call \\"The Protocols\\" a fabrication.<br /><br />In this book, we see many people claim victory over this lie, only to see \\"The Protocols\\" arise again, like some sort of undead monster.  But I think this misses a big point.  Namely that there is a difference between a lie, produced with a serious intent to deceive, and a taunt (such as, say, \\"your mother is a garbage truck\\") which is designed to insult and certainly is untrue, but does not have deception as a primary goal.  A taunt can't have deception as a primary goal (imagine the taunted victim admitting that yes, her mother truly is a garbage truck, and here is a photo of the truck and a birth certificate).<br /><br />That means that \\"The Protocols\\" really can be defeated.  Oh yes, copies will still be sold here and there.  But most responsible people will dismiss this as a taunt, not as a controversial or serious work.  And that is indeed happening.  I think the deceptive power of this fabrication is diminishing, maybe significantly.<br /><br />There will be other lies in the future.  And \\"The Protocols\\" is still around.  But, with that big stake through its heart, this libel is indeed in just the kind of trouble it deserves.<br /><br />I recommend this book.ptive power of this fabrication is diminishing, maybe significantly.

Sure, the first third of the book does rely too much on the works of Van Creveld and Morris.  And it could have said something more (and something different) about Israel's war in Lebanon.  But it is fairly reasonable.  It does spend a little time showing how Sharon won the libel suit against Time Magazine.  And it has some interesting material from Sharon's time as leader of Unit 101 (an anti-terrorism squad that was formed in 1953, after more than 450 Israelis died in terrorist attacks over a three-year period).<br /><br />There is plenty of discussion about retaliatory raids for terror attacks.  Can one simply ask folks nicely not to allow their towns to sponsor terrorist attacks?  Um, no.  That does not work.  The people in the town simply deny them.  And they mention that they are not required to keep Israel safe!  Well, what if one fights back?  Doesn't that just provoke more terror?  Not necessarily.  We see that even the Kibeyeh raid did more to slow down terror than increase it.<br /><br />Still, the best part of this work is the excellent history from 1997 to 2002, which takes up about two thirds of the book.  We are told of the BBC's vicious untruths in its program \\"The Accused,\\" which aired in June of 2001.  We read about the Durban conference.  And the battle of Jenin.  And much more.<br /><br />I've seen quite a few books about Israel fall down badly when they get to recent history.  This one is a big exception to that rule.  I recommend it.	2005-05-17

But what if we failed to do this?  What if rational thought were suppressed?  What would happen?  This experiment has been run.  And the result was the Dark Ages.  In the fourth century AD, Western thought was indeed suppressed by the Christians, and the result was the destruction of the society, the dramatic lowering of the population and standard of living, a loss of political independence, and a catastrophic devaluation of truth and scholarship.  There was no one to stand on the shoulders of an Archimedes any more.  As other readers have pointed out, the Plato University in Athens was closed, and the Library of Alexandria was destroyed.  Hypatia was literally ripped to shreds, with her fate symbolic of the fate of all rational thought in the West.  One gets the feeling that if some natural catastrophe were to kill off half the people on Earth, it would take society far less than a thousand years to recover.  The effect of Christianity was more severe than that.  As Freeman tells us, there weren't any recorded astronomical observations by Westerners in the entirety of the sixth through fifteenth centuries.  The study of other sciences was similarly obliterated.<br /><br />This book tells us about how it happened.  Once again, as others have pointed out, Paganism, with its lack of a totalitarian authority that had jurisdiction over everyone, was not a threat to rational thought.  In fact, it went right along with it.  That was not true of Christianity.<br /><br />Freeman claims that Aquinas helped open the West to rationalism once again, by using it in his works.  That seems to me to be a bit of an exaggeration, but I think it's worth considering.<br /><br />The author claims that the Church did not explicitly undermine the Roman Empire.  It had tactical reasons for wishing to preserve authority.  And it did survive the collapse of Rome.  Gibbon, by contrast, stresses the damage early Christianity did to Western thought and how much Christianity actually subverted Rome.  I tend to agree more with Gibbon than Freeman here, but I think both authors need to be read and appreciated.<br /><br />In any case, Freeman gets across the nature of the early Christians and the catastrophic and horrifying loss of reason that occured in the fourth century in the West.  I highly recommend this book.thought and how much Christianity actually subverted Rome.

But the causes for evolution are certainly grounds worthy of debate.  To some extent, that is true even today, let alone in 1932.<br /><br />We start right out with a discussion of genes and mutations, with drosophila as examples.  That includes a chapter on the cellular basis of heredity and a chapter on Mendelian inheritance.  After that, the author tells us about variability and artificial selection, including issues of infertility associated with inbreeding.  And next, there is a chapter about adaptation and natural selection.  It is pointed out that one can be both a \\"mutationist\\" and an \\"adaptationist,\\" but at the time, some scientists stressed one over the other.  Morgan points out that mutation is a clear mechanism for accomplishing evolution, and that Darwin himself had, of course, not said so specifically (given that mutation theory was not developed until long after Darwin wrote).<br /><br />Of course, natural selection does not mean just survival of the fittest but reproduction of the fittest, and that leads us to a chapter on sexual selection.<br /><br />Morgan then discusses embryonic development.  Does the embryo truly \\"repeat in its development the history of the evolution of the group to which it belongs?\\"  This is, of course, recapitulation theory, as formulated by Haeckel.  And the answer, in general, is no: the higher forms do not necessarily repeat all phases of development of earlier ancestral forms.  On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence of repetition of developmental stages (examples being gill slits and aortic arches needed for fish showing up in bird embryos), and this at least gives more evidence for evolution.<br /><br />Next there is a chapter on acquired characteristics, where Lamarckian theories are obliterated.  And after that is a chapter on the social evolution of man, and some speculations about the extent to which we can direct, or at least interfere with, the future evolution of our species.<br /><br />We then get to evolution and order of nature, where Morgan reminds us that evolution is a scientific endeavor which needs to be consistent with laws from chemistry and other scientific fields, and is independent of religion.  The final chapter deals with speculations about mechanistic and metaphysical theories.<br /><br />This is an excellent book about evolution, written halfway between the time of Darwin's Origin of Species and the present..

And by Divinity, I mean study of the monotheistic god.  I have very little respect for that god.  Let's see how the 23 authors in this book fare when dealing with this topic.<br /><br />The first argument for the existence of the monotheist god is the ontological one, by Saint Anselm.  Anselm argued that perfection entails existence.  Since the monotheistic god is perfect, it exists.  But Saint Thomas Aquinas rejects this argument.  Descartes and Liebniz restate and expand on Anselm's argument, but then Kant argues that existence is not really a predicate.  And Norman Malcolm provides further discussion.  I think the whole argument is silly given that no being can be perfect, and that even if a being could be perfect in some respect, no such being might exist.  But I do think it applies far better to the real Goddesses and Gods than to the monotheist god.<br /><br />We then get to the \\"first cause\\" argument.  Plato, Aquinas, and Copelston explain the basis for this argument.  But David Hume argues that there is no contradiction in omitting a \\"first cause.\\"  I think that a complex first cause simply violates Occam's Razor.  Whatever the Gods and Goddesses may be, they are not first causes.  Perhaps existence can come from nothing, but there is no reason to assume that it starts with impossibly infinite complexity.<br /><br />After that we have the argument from Design.  A watch needs a watchmaker.  Paley states this argument, unaware of Hume's strong criticism of it from 23 years earlier.  I think this argument does suffer from one of the same problems as the First Cause Argument, namely \\"who made god?\\"<br /><br />We then get to the problem of evil (which appears to make hash out of the hypothesis that there is an omnipotent and benevolent god).  And arguments from morality, and from religious experience.<br /><br />There's an interesting debate between Copelston and Bertrand Russell.  After this, there is an article that discusses the validity of biblical arguments, and another about whether theistic proofs make sense even from a religious point of view.<br /><br />We then get to a powerful argument, namely falsification.  This is stated powerfully by A. J. Ayer and Anthony Flew.  Namely, what would have to happen (or have to have happened) to convince one that god does not love us or does not exist?  The answer to that question helps define what one means when one discusses god (if in fact there is any cognitive meaning at all).  Braithwaite concedes this argument, but explains that religious statements have ethical significance, while John Hick asserts that the claim of god's existence is of a factual nature.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those interested in the subject.There's an interesting debate between Copelston and Bertrand Russell.

We see a few accusations of a \\"liberal\\" or a \\"conservative\\" media.  But that misses the point; what we really have is a lying media.  A media for which truth has become an enemy rather than a value.  Of course, ratings are the goal, and truth may well interfere with that goal, at least in the short term.  And we see some folks even claim that truth is just relative anyway (and only in the eye of the beholder).  But it isn't.  There is such a thing as honest and accurate reporting.  And we consumers need to have a way to say so, objectively, when we're not getting that.<br /><br />I think people of all political persuasions need to read this book.  I'm a liberal, and I found myself sympathizing with some of the author's complaints politically.  But I would have sympathized with some of them had I been a conservative.  I was impressed by the way that the author analyzed bad reporting independent of its political stance.<br /><br />I was especially intrigued by the section on propaganda.  Here, Kitty shows us how the media feed us an overdose of dubious anecdotes, demonization, and material from which relevant parts have been censored.  We see stories with all sorts of logical holes that are simply designed to get a reaction from the audience rather than report accurately, educate, or inform.  And we are misled by straight-faced claims that are utter nonsense, such as that prosperity for one side in a struggle would be a violation of rights for the other side.<br /><br />I do not know how thoroughly the author takes her own advice.  But we certainly ought to!	2005-05-08

But the author fails to condemn any of this or even point out that such acts are counterproductive both in the short term and in the long term.<br /><br />I'll give just a taste of the things Bashar has said that are quoted in the book.  In a speech in front of Pope John Paul II in Damascus, Bashar claimed that Jews were \\"aggressing against Muslim and Christian holy sites\\" in the Levant.  He mentioned al Aqsa, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and the Church of the Nativity in particular!  That is the opposite of reality.  And no matter what Bashar is trying to accomplish, absurd taunts like these are not going to help.  Truth has value.  And Leverett ought to tell us so.  In addition, the author should have pointed out just how far from truth such statements are.<br /><br />The author quotes several more atrocious libels against Israelis and Jews.  These include an illogical and preposterous comment that Israel might not want peace (presumably, he expects us to think it is true and natural that Israelis would all want poverty and death instead of happiness, life, and prosperity).  And the even more untruthful remark that Israeli society is more racist than the German National Socialists (something further from the truth would actually be hard to find).<br /><br />I do not recommend this book.	2005-05-08

And that terror is a means to do this.  That's better than dismissing terror as a reaction of those who are too desperate to do anything else.<br /><br />Of course, there are few records of those who are truly desperate resorting to terror.  Most truly desperate people would rather flee.  Force would be used only against those trying to kill them or stopping their flight.  And a very large number of truly desperate people do not have the means to commit terrorist acts.  So while this book does characterize terrorists to some extent, it doesn't say anything profound.<br /><br />The author does, however, avoid the real questions about why there is a war in the first place.<br /><br />Why is it that terrorists are so sure that they can't get what they want through negotiations?  Usually, it is because terrorist demands are so extreme.  But Bloom doesn't tell us this.  And in fact, the demands of Islamist terrorists in Israel are so extreme (getting rid of the Jewish population) that most folks assume that the Jews would rather fight than allow this.<br /><br />Why can't the terrorists get what they want by calling the cops?  Can't an outside force satisfy them?  Generally, no, it won't.  Most rational people will think twice before supporting those whose goals appear suspect.  Still, it is the best chance, given that some people may be fooled or bribed into supporting an illegitimate cause.  Again, the author does not even hint at this.<br /><br />Now, there is a final option.  Why do terrorists fight at all?  If the cause is legitimate, won't it win in the long run anyway?  Well, some terrorists are in a hurry.  But there is another answer, which, once again, the author does not tell us.  Namely, terrorist demands generally represent greed and arbitrariness.  They won't be met in the long run.  In fact, they won't be met at all.<br /><br />And this is the point I truly wish the author had made.  Most terrorists are not primarily fighting for rights that they might get some day, anyway.  If they were, at least one could sympathize with some aspects of their cause.  They are fighting to take away rights from people they dislike.  That's bad enough, but here is where there is an even more important point: the terrorists can't win.  There will always be people the terrorists dislike.<br /><br />Bloom is right to question some of the anti-terror strategies, but she made a big mistake when she implied that the terrorists have constructive goals that may one day be met.I truly wish the author had made.

But they can do plenty of damage. The author points out that some folks are opposed to anti-terror measures, no matter what they may be.  But that policy is no good.  As the author reminds us, \\"the state's primary function is the protection of its citizens, and there is no rational defense for the kind of random violence directed at noncombatants that is the essence of terror.\\"<br /><br />That's true.  And if the state refuses to defend its citizens against violence, vigilantes will try their hand at it and the society will fall further apart.  Something has to be done to oppose terror if we want to have a productive society.<br /><br />Well, perhaps one can appease the terrorists.  But the author points out that many, if not most, terrorists are unappeasable.  Instead, they relish the freedoms they enjoy in Canada as they go about trying to destroy them.  Yes, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien did, in a speech at the United Nations, \\"propose ending terror through foreign aid.\\"  But Bell explains that this is not going to work.  I agree.  In many cases, such money winds up being given to terrorists, which generally leads to more terror.<br /><br />This book shows how poorly Canada has fared in dealing with the problem of terrorists within its borders.  And it shows dramatically just what some of the results have been.  I highly recommend it.	2005-05-07

These rights were attacked in the 1920s and 1930s.  The British White Paper of 1939 was a direct attack on Jewish rights and got almost all the Levantine Jews to insist on a state in order to protect their lives, liberty, property, and right to immigrate.<br /><br />Now, what about Jewish terror?  There was some, and it was directed against the British, not to evict the British from Britain, but from the Levant, a place British troops had no more right to be in than the German troops in the Soviet Union in the same decade.  It might have been reasonable to look for actual parallels and differences in the goals of Jewish and Arab terrorists, but the author makes no real effort to do this.<br /><br />Nor does the author explain that Arab terrorism in Israel is in fact a war against Jewish rights there.  If the Arabs called off this war, there would be peace.  Not because Jews are somehow immune from wanting to be greedy or wicked, but because the Israeli Jews happen to want to survive and prosper.  An unnecessary war might be almost the only way to lose all of this.  On the other hand, if the Jews call off their self-defense, there may be a very short pause, but after that, it is likely that the Asian Jews will be evicted, if not exterminated.  After which there may be another short pause, followed by more misadventures, given that getting rid of the Jews will not benefit those who remain in the region.<br /><br />Instead, the author says that Arab violence \\"is to recover lost rights\\" and is due to colonization of their land.  Well, actually that violence is to obliterate Jewish rights.  The author is not being honest here.<br /><br />Nasser then says that a central part of Zionism was ethnic cleansing!  \\"Ethnic purification was so important to Zionist planners because of the demographics involved.\\"  This is a malicious untruth.  There's no record of Zionists planning ethnic purification.  There were a few instances of some Arabs being evicted during a war that the Arabs started.  But in Haifa, the Zionists were begging the Arabs to stay, while the Arabs refused.  That does not sound like very efficient planning of ethnic cleansing by the Jews!  And many Arabs did stay, with the Jews treating them well.  Demographics favored the Jews back then: many were moving to a state that was already about 50% Jewish.  I think that in peacetime, demographics still favors the Jews: Israel is small and there are far more than enough Jews to dominate its less than 11,000 square miles.  Nor is there any reason to believe that the presence of Arabs in Israel would get rid of Jewish rights.  Nasser's entire claim is absurd.<br /><br />The author discusses Israeli self-defense, something he calls \\"Israeli terror.\\"  Considering how fatal unnecessary violence would be to the Jews, I wonder what would motivate them to commit acts of terror?  Why would the Jews prefer to be poor and dead to being happy, alive, and prosperous?  I want to know!  Nasser says that the Zionists have a \\"motivation of permanently subjugating the occupied territories.\\"  He has to be kidding.  Zionists need peace and they know it.  And Arabs have something at stake as well, namely a vast Empire.  Arabs could use peace too.  And that is something the author has conveniently forgotten.ed.\\"  This is a malicious untruth.

And plenty has been written by these Christians.  This book is in the second of these categories.<br /><br />We start right out learning that the land belongs to Abraham and his descendants in perpetuity.  Of course, as a Pagan, it may not surprise anyone that I reject that attitude.  I think there are indeed ways to acquire land.  And that Jews have both a right and an incentive to acquire (by legal purchase) land in Jerusalem.  But they also have a right to sell that land.<br /><br />There is a brief history of the Temple Mount and the temples that have been built there.  I hadn't realized that the Jews had built four temples in places other than Jerusalem, two in Egypt, one on Mount Gerazim (the Samaritan temple) and one west of Amman (presumably Philadelphia).  Anyway, the authors do not show too much sympathy for the destruction of the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.  They clearly prefer the monotheist god to real Gods and Goddesses!<br /><br />But then we get to the interesting stuff, preparations to build a new temple.  Who wants to do this, and why?  Will they succeed?  Should they be supported or opposed?<br /><br />The authors say that the temple ought to be rebuilt.  It is one of the 613 commandments in the Torah (Number 20, according to Maimonedes).  It would also be the fulfilment of a dream, and a unifying rallying point for the Jewish nation.  Several thousand Jews have explicitly supported the idea.<br /><br />My reaction to this is simple.  If a few thousand people want to build a temple, they may very well do just that.  In addition, it seems that the number of people interested in doing so is as likely to increase as not.  There are, after all, millions of Jews.<br /><br />And we also see the reaction of many evangelical Christians.  I think all sides see that the issue is partly one of religious freedom.  And I think there is a powerful argument for letting the Jews build a new temple.  But I also think it would be best to try to avoid knocking down the temples of others to do so.  And that leads right in to the part of the book that discusses where the previous temple was.<br /><br />I hope that the nationalistic, religious, and human rights issues can be separated in this case.  And I hope that people on both sides will agree that a new Jewish temple should be permitted, if some Jews want to build one.  And I also hope they will agree not to tear down other temples.  But I am not too optimistic about any of this.<br /><br />In any case, I found this book very interesting.argument for letting the Jews build a new temple.

And there is excellent advice about how to play these fine works.<br /><br />Still, there are arguments about what Beethoven really intended, especially in regard to tempos.  And this book concentrates on what four of Beethoven's students, Karl Czerny, Ferdinand Ries, Ignaz Moscheles, and Anton Schindler concluded about how to play these pieces.<br /><br />Of course, this task is not made any easier by the fact that of these four, Schindler may have had the best opportunity to discover what Beethoven really thought about some of the sonatas.  And Schindler eagerly published his views about them.  But the other students were far better musicians.  And of all four students, Moscheles may have been the one who had heard the most Beethoven performances of them.  Meanwhile, Czerny probably was the one who had performed these sonatas most often in Beethoven's presence.<br /><br />This book lists the tempos recommended for every movement of 29 of the sonatas (the two easy sonatas and the sonatina are omitted), by Czerny in 1842, Czerny in 1850 and Moscheles in 1858, as well as the more recent editions (von Bulow in 1894 and Schnabel in 1935).  And we see some big differences in recommendations.<br /><br />Yes, the \\"fastest\\" tempo is the very end of the Waldstein, where a whole note equals as much as 88.  But there are some interesting differences between the recommendations of Moscheles or Czerny and what I learned from von Bulow's edition of the sonatas.  Basically, (albeit with a few exceptions) Moscheles recommended playing them faster.  In sonata 1, Bulow had the finale with a half note at 104, Moscheles at 112.  Moscheles had the finale of the Pathetique a little faster too, 104 to 96 for a half note.<br /><br />I thought von Bulow was making it tough on me in the Tempest, with the allegro putting a half note at 108.  Moscheles made it 126.  And his finale was faster too.  Moscheles also wanted the finale of the Appassionata a little faster than von Bulow.  And so on.<br /><br />When it comes to dynamics, the intent is stressed over the actual loudness.  Pianissimo is never to be inaudible or indistinct.  It is to give a feeling of secrecy or mysteriousness.  Fortissimo is as loud as it gets, within the limits of beauty.<br /><br />There is some advice about Beethoven's frequent crescendos and subito pianos.  And I always wondered how we were supposed to honor the occasional Beethoven crescendos during sustained notes.  Moscheles omits them.<br /><br />There's plenty more about style, accentuation, and ornamentation.  And a chapter on pedaling.  Here, there is a hint that Beethoven may have recommended a little more pedaling than is needed today, given the nature of the pianofortes of his day (others may disagree).  But the book agrees with most everyone else that Beethoven really meant it when he put that long pedal at the end of the development of the finale of the Waldstein.<br /><br />I learned quite a bit from this book, and I recommend it.aster too.

But there is a flip side to this, the fear of \\"shanda fur de goyim\\" (embarrassment in front of the gentiles).<br /><br />Dershowitz analyzes the discrimination he's seen against Jews.  In some places, it is non-existent.  In others, it is significant.  In yet others, it is striking.  He begins with his experiences in trying to find employment as a summer hire in various law firms.  Of course, discrimination against people on the basis of race, religion, gender, and (if known) sexual preference is now much less than it used to be.  But we see some of the history of it among law firms and at Harvard.<br /><br />One issue that I found intriguing was that of the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.  Now, I do not see any reason for Jews or anyone else to consider Auschwitz, of all places, holy ground.  But I am well aware that many people do consider it as such, and I respect their views on the matter.  And it was up to the Catholic authorities whether or not to make a deal with the Jews to not have a Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.  But once the Catholics made that deal and a bunch of nuns broke it, a rabbi and six other Jews were totally within their rights to ask the nuns to explain what they were doing there, and even \\"trespass\\" on convent grounds to pray.  And it was certainly out of line for Polish Cardinal Glemp to make a totally wild and preposterous accusation, namely that these Jews were trying to murder the nuns and destroy the convent.  I think Dershowitz was right to take the case against Glemp for defamation here.<br /><br />There is an good chapter about Zionism.  That includes a discussion of Jewish antizionism.  Dershowitz explains the pressure on Jews to be antizionist and to oppose Israel as Jews.  He thinks they are wrong to do so.  I agree.  I think everyone ought to support Israel's (or any other nation's) right to exist as a human being, or oppose it as a human being!  Or be neutral as a human being.<br /><br />I recommend this book.<br /> <br />I recommend this book. <br />	2005-05-04

Shermer starts by explaining a little about what science and scholarship are.  One example he gives of scholarship is in the field of history.  It is fair to ask to what extent Aristotle and other Greeks may have been influenced by ideas from Africa.  That can be examined in a scholarly manner.  But it is outrageous to simply claim that Aristotle \\"stole\\" ideas from the Library of Alexandria, which was built after Aristotle died.<br /><br />Shermer then gets into ways we can mislead ourselves.  We tend to underestimate the extent to which our theories, equipment, and observations color our interpretations of our results.  We sometimes exaggerate the importance of anecdotes, rumors, boldness, and heresy.  We often underestimate the power of enormous amounts of evidence.  And we can make a variety of logical errors.  We see some interesting examples, including an analysis of some claims of extrasensory perception.<br /><br />As a Polytheist, I'm intrigued by epidemics of accusations of witchcraft, and Shermer gives a little analysis of these.  There is also a discussion of cults, and one example is of Ayn Rand's followers (a group I would have expected to exhibit a little more skepticism).<br /><br />After this comes a comparison of evolution-denial and holocaust-denial.  These are both anti-intellectual, to put it mildly.  Now, why is it that both are attacked almost unanimously by scholars?  Is it a circling of the wagons against outsiders?  No.  Shermer quotes Murray Gell-Mann, who explains that outsiders can make valuable contributions.  The reason for the near unanimity is that the deniers are talking utter nonsense.<br /><br />There is a section at the end that discusses why some rather smart people are rather easy to fool.  The reason is that smart people often overestimate their ability to see through nonsense.  When they do get tricked, they are slow to admit it.  And those who actually try to trick people (rather than simply talk nonsense or taunt people) are generally good enough at it to trick just about anyone, as any amateur magician realizes.<br /><br />There's plenty of information in this book, and I enjoyed reading it.actually try to trick people (rather than simply talk nonsense or taunt people) are generally good enough at it to trick just about anyone, as any amateur magician realizes. <br /> <br />There's plenty of information in this book, and I enjoyed reading it. <br /> <br />	2005-05-03

You get to see all sorts of points of view.<br /><br />The book starts with articles that discuss how religious American society is.  After that is an article claiming that Protestant Christianity is basically America's religion.  And one claiming that our cultural heritage is really America's religion.  And we see a opposing articles on whether America's identity is religious or secular.<br /><br />Now, do religious values preserve democracy or undermine it?  Barbara Ehrenreich argues that they undermine it.  I agree: I think religious values can preclude useful debate.<br /><br />Should religious leaders challenge public policy?  We see arguments on both sides of this issue.  And we see some interesting arguments on the reverse question, namely whether politicians ought to promote their religious values.<br /><br />On the latter issue, I think we need to promote our personal values, and be careful to avoid implying that we will take moral direction from spiritual leaders.  If we want to support human rights, we ought to say so as individuals.<br /><br />Is it religious discrimination to ban public prayer in schools?  Well, as a Polytheist, I would say no.  A school is supposed to be a secular place.  I think school prayer makes the state a partner in evangelizing for monotheism.<br /><br />There are articles about the extent to which government ought to interfere with personal religious beliefs.  Well, my reaction is simple.  There are secular laws.  If your personal beliefs are such that you break them, you should and will face the consequences.<br /><br />Is television evangelism legitimate?  There are articles on both sides of this.  But while I'm not so sure that the television medium is special in this regard, I think there is a serious issue with sincerity.  Some evangelists are simply untruthful hypocrites.  And I wouldn't dream of calling them legitimate.<br /><br />Will religious faith of Americans increase or decline?  We see articles on both sides, of course.<br /><br />Finally, what about non-monotheist religions?  Well, there are a couple of articles about the New Age movement.  I hoped there would be something a little better than that.  But at least it gives one a chance to discuss the problems of religious authoritarianism. Too many people look to others for spiritual advice when they ought to be making up their own minds about who they are and what they want to do.<br /><br />I recommend this book.ith of Americans increase or decline?

It is not totally comprehensive on the issue of arguments about the monotheist god (for example, the Kalam argument is not included).  And there is virtually no discussion of the Pagan Goddesses and Gods.  But I still like what the book does contain.<br /><br />I've always despised the monotheist god as powerless and unworthy of respect.  This articles in this book make a case against it, so I like it for that reason already.<br /><br />My strongest complaint (but far from my only complaint) about the monotheist god is that it is supposed to be The First Cause.  Well, I do not like that concept much.  It is similar to saying that the world rests on the back of a large turtle.  Well, what does that turtle rest on?  A larger turtle!  And do not worry, there are turtles all the way down, each one larger than the previous one!<br /><br />The analogy with a First Cause is obvious, there are causes all the way down, with god being the biggest!  Infinitely big.  But I think this begs the question.  We are trying to explain the simple in terms of the complex, not a good idea philosophically.  The only way to get any sense out of this is for the causes to be simpler as you go down.  And that makes the first cause infinitely weak, small, and powerless.  And not strong at all.<br /><br />On top of that, I think the monotheist god not only has too many inconsistent qualities, it is also a little too talented at opposite kinds of things.  What does it mean to be perfectly patient and perfectly impatient at the same time?<br /><br />Anyway, the book starts with Kant's fine attack on the ontological argument for the existence of god, which happens to be one of the few pro-god arguments that I actually think is worth reading about.  It then makes a more serious point, namely that a benevolent and omnipotent god is inconsistent with observed reality.<br /><br />There are, of course, discussions of the First Cause argument.  And the argument from Design.  There is also a discussion of the idea that when one thinks about god, one ought to avoid reason, logic, and facts!<br /><br />There is a great chapter about ineffability.  I think this is an interesting argument, namely that belief in god is a reasonable, helpful, and self-consistent concept, but it is just hard to explain it to everyone!  And that leads into arguments about religious experience.<br /><br />I like the section about free will and evil.  The argument is often made that god has a choice between making us Good by force and allowing us the Freedom to be Bad.  But that is surely a false choice.  We could be more rational!<br /><br />Then there is a section on morality without god (a concept I think we all need to ponder on, given that the monotheist god surely does not actually exist as described by the major monotheist religions).  A section on illusions of immortality.  And on the \\"meaning\\" of life, of the cosmos, and of existence.<br /><br />Finally, there is an article about religious claims that an honest and scholarly search for truth is in fact malicious.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.rse, discussions of the First Cause argument.

So I was able to read this book fairly dispassionately.  But in it, I did see some attempts to explain why some people purport to believe some assertions that are truly strange, and why they refuse to even consider questioning them.<br /><br />There is a tendency for many of us to think everyone is just like ourselves.  But that is not the case.  There are things I would fight very hard for, such as human rights, justice, and truth.  But I have met people who have a strong desire to fight against them.  We're not talking about people who simply have a strong but misplaced sense of fairness.  We're talking about fanaticism which can result in truly counterproductive behavior that most people will later refer to as irrational.<br /><br />In this superb book, Eric Hoffer gives us some of his thoughts about mass movements, not all of which he dismisses as uniformly bad.  The first comment is that mass movements are bred by a combination of discontent and a sense of power.  And he then emphasizes the interchangeability of mass movements.  But here I think I would have spent some more time distinguishing between rational and irrational ones.  It can be rational to buy nice clothes, or prepare good food, or raise children, or work as a scientist or engineer, or even travel to a faraway land.  It can be rational to help others in emergencies, such as storms, floods, fires, epidemics, famines, or invasions.  Yet each of these activities could be done with a sense of purpose that is similar to that of any religious fanatic.  I'm not interested in that.  I'm interested in mass movements that lead folks astray.  And into counterproductive and irrational activities.<br /><br />The author then characterizes various types of people who often have a susceptibility to being recruited for a mass movement: the poor, misfits, outcasts, minorities, adolescents, the ambitious, the obsessed, the impotent, the selfish, the bored, and the sinners.<br /><br />Hoffer explains that once in a mass movement, one begins to identify strongly with a group as opposed to seeing oneself as an individual.  That makes self-sacrifice a distinct possibility.  And the author also reminds us that a fanatic uses a cause as an anchor.  That person can be converted to some other cause, even an opposite cause, but never by appeals to reason or morality.  An interesting observation!<br /><br />Thus, the fanatic and moderate are poles apart.  Fanatics of opposite sides are basically siblings.<br /><br />Now, what about unifying agents?  Hatred is a good one.  So is imitation.  And action.  And now Hoffer makes another great point: propaganda is overrated.  If people stop believing, propaganda will not convince them at all.  Propaganda is of little use without force to back it up.<br /><br />Hoffer explains that without a big bunch of people ready to be led, a potential leader has nothing.  But without a talented leader, a movement has nothing.  He gives Lenin as an example.  I am unconvinced: I think it is quite possible for movements to do just fine with a total idiot for a leader, or with no leader at all.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it.impotent, the selfish, the bored, and the sinners.   <br /> <br />Hoffer explains that once in a mass movement, one begins to identify strongly with a group as opposed to seeing oneself as an individual.

Not really.  But it will help you get there.<br /><br />There are twelve excellent lessons, with ten or fifteen very well chosen exercises at the end of each lesson.  The next twelve lessons are in the companion book, \\"Assess Your Chess Fast.\\"<br /><br />Lesson 1 gives some elementary positions, and some openings where famous beginner's errors get one side mated fast. A couple of fine examples of the Vienna Game are included here.<br /><br />The next lesson teaches the elementary mates, and tells a little about the Scotch Game.  Lesson 3 is devoted to the King's Gambit.  A chess player has to know how to play a tactical position.  Fourteen games with the King's Gambit are analyzed.  And in lesson 4, we learn more about the Scotch Game, with five examples of the Scotch Gambit, a couple more examples without gambit play, and a nice discussion of the Two Knight's defense.<br /><br />In the following lesson, the author reminds us that a single poor move is sufficient to turn a good opening into a bad one.  That means to him that you can play just about any opening you feel comfortable with.  If you want to set traps, you can do it.  The important thing is to use your intelligence, not your memory.  He discusses the Giuoco Piano opening.<br /><br />Lesson 6 gives some examples of pins and traps involving them, while lesson 7 has some fine examples of attacks on the castled King, the first few of which involve sacrificing one's Bishop for the enemy King Rook Pawn.<br /><br />Lesson 8 shows how to make use of the advantage of the Bishop pair.  In lesson 9, we see how to use one's Rooks, opening files, getting the Rooks on them, and getting them into the enemy position.  The next two lessons are on endings, good bishops against knights, bad bishops, bishops of opposite colors, Queen endings, Rook endings, and Pawn endings.<br /><br />The final lesson is on how to think in chess.  That includes advice to check for potential blunders before each move (Do you have material en prise? Is a sacrifice or fork threatened?  Can you be put in check, and if so, what are the potential consequences of the check?).  It also includes a famous position shown by de Groot to many top Grandmasters (I think all but one solved it correctly rather quickly).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.have material en prise?

I think Morris has a number of good points to make.  I didn't always agree with the author, but I still like this book.<br /><br />Morris starts by pointing out that the New York Times is untrustworthy.  Did he just now realize this?  Anyway, he shows that its polling methods are biased, confusing people on all sides of issues.  And worse, that it pays for interviews and scoops by pulling punches.<br /><br />Now, we were attacked by terrorists on 9/11.  Why do the terrorists hate us?  Morris says it is simple.  We have freedom of religion and speech.  And we have rights for women, Jews, and other minorities.<br /><br />I think that we need to admit that there are people who say that we're forgetting poverty, despair, and American support for foreign despots.  Obviously, poverty is bad.  Despair is bad.  We ought not promote either.  And we aren't helping matters when we support dictators in an attempt to have \\"stability.\\"  But I feel these are not the main reasons for why we were attacked.  I think that our perceived support for Israel proves it.  Israel is not a dictatorship.  I think complaints about our support for Israel tend to make Morris' point.<br /><br />Of course, Morris has plenty to say about these issues in this book.  And he discusses at length claims by others that the war on terror is racist and an excuse to grab Iraqi oil.  And that we should change our policy, and appease the United Nations and support Arab terror when it is against Israel.  Morris replies that the issue is not racism, but terrorism, and some profiling is indeed needed.  As well as that Israel clearly wants to be left in peace, and Arabs are the ones initiating the violence in the Levant.<br /><br />The author discusses France and its reaction to terror.  France strongly favors appeasement, and Morris says that this is likely in response to the terrible casualties it suffered in World War I.<br /><br />What about the United Nations?  Morris simply wants us to avoid it at least as long as France has a veto.  I certainly would not say this myself.  I'd get rid of the UN entirely.<br /><br />There is an interesting chapter on Enron and its significance.  And one on nursing homes.  And one on reducing tobacco sales.  And there is one on how a couple of states (Iowa and Arizona) are no longer gerrymandering their congressional districts!  If all states did that, it would refranchise us voters.<br /><br />I recommend this book.is simply wants us to avoid it at least as long as France has a veto.  I certainly would not say this myself.

And special pleading (if I do it, it's cool, if you do it, it's tacky).  You'll see links in a chain of reasoning omitted.  And false premises, and omitted premises.  And non sequiturs (omitted chains).  Suppressed majors.  Negated minors.  Argumentum ad ignorantiam.  Question-begging (sticking your conclusion into a premise).<br /><br />There is advice about false generalizations.  Get your opponent to admit that your examples are true.  Do not ask about the validity of the general case, but later act as if this has been admitted as well.<br /><br />Then there are \\"false choice\\" arguments, where you pretend that the only alternative to your policy is some manifestly crazy \\"straw-man\\" counterplan.  And there are false reductio ad absurdums and false counterexamples.  There are also suggestive questions, such as asking why something is true, when it may not be true at all.<br /><br />There are hidden judgments, as anyone will discover when she calls a city by its name in one language as opposed to another.<br /><br />A very important stratagem is argumentum ad auditores (this ought to be illegal in a debate).  Here, you simply make an argument that you and your opponent know full well is totally invalid, hoping to win over your audience.  If your audience is a mob, it is called argumentum ad captandum.<br /><br />You'll learn to blitz your opponent by talking fast (and maybe especially softly or loudly as well).  And to extend your opponent's propositions, exaggerate them, and make them absolute.<br /><br />If you think your opponent has a potentially strong but unusual counter to what you are about to propose, get her to admit the opposite of it before you start your main argument (advice from Aristotle).  Try to ask it so that a \\"no\\" answer is the one you want.  Never tell an opponent that you have won an argument.  You do not want to hear her reply.  Address victory claims only to the audience.<br /><br />I've used plenty of Latin here.  That's a good idea in general; it makes you look wise even though you are just another plebeian.  Don't say \\"No way!\\"  Say \\"Non possumus.\\"<br /><br />You'll learn that the line \\"That is all very good in theory, but it would never work in practice\\" is in fact a famous sophism.<br /><br />And there is much more in this terrific essay.  Perhaps the most interesting advice is this.  If an opponent comes up with some captious sophistry, try to dispose of her ex concessis rather than ad rem.  That is, come up with something just as silly as her nonsense (as long as it is something she can't or won't refute).  After all, you are seeking victory, not truth!  Schopenhauer assures us that this works better.<br /><br />I'd be more than a little reluctant to follow this last bit of advice, but I truly enjoyed The Art of Controversy.an argument.

Jeane Kirkpatrick points out that in the first intifada, spin was heavily against Israel, and 80% of reported comments from American Jews were critical of Israel.  Marvin Maurer shows how the media shape the news to fit an overall picture of Israel being important and wrong.  He explains that the media often collude with rioters to produce stories.  And he says that reporters need to cover Israel responsibly, as if it were Norway.<br /><br />We see how the Los Angeles Times gave 1667 column inches to Afghanistan in a year in which there were about a million casualties, and 3122 inches to Gaza and the West Bank in just two months during which there were less than a hundred casualties.<br /><br />Ed Koch also mentions how Arabs tailor their rhetoric and actions to the television crews that tape them.  And he says, \\"This is not news.  This is acting.\\"<br /><br />Stephen Karetzky has a long and excellent analysis of the New York Times' propaganda war against Israel.  It is shocking.<br /><br />There is also an example of terrible bias from another paper, \\"The Record,\\" which serves Bergen County, New Jersey.  Here, Eli Warach tells of The Record's comparisons of Israelis to Nazis (maybe that's not so bad when we read its defences of Kurt Waldheim and Martin Bormann).  And he wonders why there are so many bigoted attacks in it on Israel.  He asks what is bothering The Record, and what does it want?<br /><br />And sure, this question gets a possible answer from one of the Record's most vicious antizionists.  In effect, it is that some people are liberals, and they do not like the Jewish god, so they take it out on Israel.  But this answer does not help me.  I am a liberal, and I can't stand the Jewish god, but my reaction is very different.<br /><br />I think the media are doing the whole world a big disservice by supporting thugs and terrorists.  What will the ultimate effect of such lies be?  I think we'll see some thugs get away with all sorts of aggression, until some people fight back, at which point there will be a great deal of unnecessary carnage.  It would be fine if the media put a damper on violence, but in this case, it seems to be provoking it on both sides.<br /><br />I think that we need better media standards.  It is as simple as that.

The war truly began when Great Britain came up with the White Paper of 1939.  And Begin, who led the Irgun, one of the Jewish groups fighting against Great Britain, was instrumental in helping the Jews win that fight.<br /><br />The book starts with Begin being sentenced to eight years in a labor camp, on April 1, 1941.  Begin's response was an involuntary \\"April Fool!\\"  And the joke may have been on his persecutors, as Begin soon wound up in the Levant, where he quickly took over the leadership of the Irgun.<br /><br />Begin states his reaction to the problems the Jews faced at that time.  If your house is on fire, you do not wait for the fire department to arrive to try to rescue your family.  By the time they get there, it may be too late.<br /><br />Many people call the Irgun a terrorist group.  But Begin explains that while both fighters for freedom and fighters for oppression may use violence to try to overthrow a regime, there is an inherent difference between them.  Physical force was neither the aim nor the creed of the Irgun, which properly believed in the supremacy of moral forces.  It was the British enemies of the Irgun which mocked morality.<br /><br />Begin tells of the British order, in 1929, that the Jews not blow notes on their Shofars at the Western Wall.  And we see the consequences of this ill-advised law.  After all, even the Roman conquerors had allowed Jews to blow their Shofars there.<br /><br />And we learn that, except during actual planned missions, the Irgun did not carry weapons.  If they were stopped and searched, they were often released on the spot.<br /><br />Begin tells of the Irgun's exploits.  And the Altalena affair, in which Begin managed to escape and convince his troops not to start a civil war.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the description of the battle for Deir Yassin.  I've always regarded some of the wilder stories about this battle with some suspicion. Here is why. The Jews, with Jerusalem besieged, decided on April 1, 1948 to counterattack.  This was really the first offensive by a Jewish army in centuries.  Two key targets were Castel and Deir Yassin, vantage points which overlooked the endangered Jerusalem road.  A Jewish failure to win any battles would doom Jerusalem.  Thus the attacks a week later were unusual.  I would have expected huge protests from the Arabs no matter what the outcome.<br /><br />Of course, the Jewish army was inexperienced.  And Begin's Irgun was especially inexperienced at such an attack.  It fell for a bogus Arab surrender.  It fell for tricks such as Iraqi soldiers dressed as women (with concealed weapons).  Nevertheless, the Jews won that battle.  It may not have been as big a battle, in terms of casualties, as Gettysburg or Stalingrad.  But it was a part of a battle for freedom and human rights that saved Western Jerusalem and I think that is worth celebrating.<br /><br />The author explains that the Arab complaints about the battle backfired, with many Arab civilians, believing wild stories about Jewish atrocities (and perhaps believing them even more given the tendency of Arab soldiers to engage in them), fleeing the battle zone.  Begin claims this effect was very significant in saving the city of Tiberias, and made the attack on Haifa easier.<br /><br />It is a fascinating book, and I recommend it.suspicion. Here is why.

I was in college when I read this book, and I believe that prior to this, I had never heard the word \\"Zionist\\" in my life. But I had heard of Arthur Koestler, the author of \\"Darkness at Noon\\" and \\"The Sleepwalkers.\\"<br /><br />And I knew that Israel was a country that had fought against Egypt in 1956.  And that Israel used ladies as fighters in its army!  And I knew one more thing.  That when war broke out in 1956, and a British captain in the Mediterranean was told that Britain was at war, he said something like, \\"Fine.  What side are we on?\\"<br /><br />Still, when I read this book, I was floored to discover how badly the British had betrayed the Jews of the Levant.  I'd imagined the Levant as being almost empty, except for a few Arabs, until the end of World War Two.  I simply assumed that Jews hadn't been there since the second century.<br /><br />The chapter on \\"The Little Death Ships\\" was a big shock to me.  There was no doubting the truth of it: I checked other sources and it was pretty much all confirmed.  I'd spent several months in England, and nobody had told me any of this.  Nor had I known anything about the War of Independence that Koestler describes so well.<br /><br />But there was one magical moment when the British, having been so complicit in the murder of millions of Jews during World War Two, could have done something easy and intelligent to partly redeem themselves, in July, 1945, when the Labour Government took power.  A major Labour Government campaign promise was to give the entire Mandate to the Jews, making it into a Jewish state.  Suppose that government, once taking power, had started to do that, but suddenly compromised, and given some of the land to the Arabs?

And Telhami knows plenty about the region!  And he has some good ideas for what we ought to do!  And I actually have little idea what we ought to do.  How can I have the nerve to give him only one star?<br /><br />I'll tell you how.<br /><br />The problem is this.  The main issues in the region are truth and human rights.  Now, Telhami does give Truth some respect.  He shows that many people in the Middle East have a big problem with Truth.  And he gives some examples.  Unfortunately, he also gives Untruth equal respect.  And he basically appears to recommend that the fight against human rights had better be given equal weight with the struggle to defend human rights.  Or else!<br /><br />And that's not enough.	2005-04-24

I said I wasn't sure, so they recommended the first edition of this book.  I simply read the book and then asked them about the problems they were working on.  They explained their problems in detail and hired me to work on them.  And because of this book, I had no trouble solving them.  This book opened up a whole new world to me.  I've used it as a reference ever since.<br /><br />Of course, before I read this book, I had learned an enormous amount of pure mathematics and engineering mathematics.  As well as fluid mechanics and thermodynamics.  I think you need to be confident about your ability to handle the math to get full value from this text.	2005-04-24

On the whole, they were able to understand the material and solve the homework problems.  I certainly wouldn't mind teaching a class on this subject from the second edition as well, which I feel is a mild improvement over the first one.<br /><br />The chapter on finite automata is excellent.  And the material on context-free languages is thorough and well written.  So is the introduction to Turing machines.<br /><br />Of course, the book then spends a fair amount of time on recursive function theory.  That is exactly what I want it to do.  And I think the chapter on unsolvability, starting with the Halting Problem, is excellent.<br /><br />The style, especially of the first edition, is a little formal.  But this is serious mathematical material, and I think it is not asking too much to require students to handle this subject in such a manner.	2005-04-24

One is from Arthur Koestler, and it is a must read.  Another article is about the heroic death of Dov Gruner.<br /><br />The articles about the War of Independence deal with the siege of Jerusalem, the battle for Yad Mordechai, and a couple of other topics.  And the articles about the 1956 war are very illuminating.  Best of all are the articles about the Six-Day war, and how Israel managed to outfight opponents whose proclaimed goal was to destroy it.<br /><br />I found this entire book fascinating, and I strongly recommend it.	2005-04-24

Especially in wartime.  But there is a line that is unwise to cross; sedition is unhelpful.  And while I do not know exactly where that line is, I would be very hesitant to appear to recommend foreign action against my own nation, especially were I to couple that with what appeared to be blatant untruths designed to justify such action.<br /><br />Not all the articles in this book do that, of course.  But at least one went far enough so that I would simply have advised the authors not to write it, just for that reason.<br /><br />There are many different \\"voices\\" in this book.  But there are some similarities.  Most, if not all of them, fail to realize that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are as legal as Arab ones.  Nor do they consider that an obvious thing to do, if for some reason the Jewish settlements were in fact illegal and on Arab land, would be to force land-poor Israel to buy most (or all) of them and keep them rather than abandon them.<br /><br />The writers are often correct in describing the present situation in Israel as bad in many respects.  But I think their recommendations would make things worse.  In addition, many of the articles are extremely misleading, which indicates to me that truth is no friend of most of the arguments made in this book.<br /><br />In one of the articles, Uri Avnery makes a good point, namely that when a whole population \\"is seething with rage\\" it becomes dangerous.  We should not forget that.  Arab incitement has indeed made the situation more dangerous.  And Arabs are not the only people on this planet who are capable of seething with rage.  Such an effect might be produced in some victims of Arab violence.  Maybe the time to try to prevent this is before it happens.	2005-04-23

Well, we'd expect a book on the subject to try to avoid making arbitrary changes that would do harm.  That is, it might make sense to some people to tear down the Dome of the Rock and put a third Jewish Temple in its place, but that would violate this principle.  And this book does, in fact, not recommend doing that!  So far, so good!<br /><br />For many centuries in ancient times, the Old City was Jewish.  More recently, the nineteenth century saw the Jews become first a plurality and then a clear majority in the Old City.  The Old City was captured by Arabs in 1948, and the Jews were expelled, but it was liberated in 1967.  Jews were allowed to return to the Old City and Arabs were allowed to be there as well.  And Jerusalem was reunified.  I think it makes sense to call the Old City, \\"the traditionally Jewish Old City.\\"  It is very misleading to strongly imply, as this book does, that the place is traditionally Arab and is being counterproductively Judaized in the twentieth century.  After all, as even the author admits, the Jewish majority in the Old City of a century ago has been replaced by an Old City today that is about ten percent Jewish.<br /><br />There is a mention of Muslim archaeology in the Old City.  But there is no indication of what a hot topic it is, given many complaints by Jews that Muslims are digging up and removing vast amounts of material, including plenty of Jewish artifacts, from the Temple Mount.  I think a reasonable recommendation would be to have such work done only by teams that include trustworthy Muslims, Jews, and others.<br /><br />The book discusses the Christians of the Old City.  Church leadership there has sided with the antizionists, and that has not helped relations with Israeli authorities.<br /><br />There is a discussion of peace proposals that involve the Old City.  Here, the author spends quite a bit of time on statistics about tourism.  That is a good point!<br /><br />The author explains that his preferred solution would be to give the Old City of Jerusalem to the Arabs (which to me sounds exactly as smart as tearing down the Dome of the Rock and replacing it with a new Jewish Temple).  But he admits that this solution is not realistic and would not create a harmonious environment.<br /><br />What the author wants now is for Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel and the capital of an Arab state.  I think this is a very poor idea which would damage the city.  And I think it is equivalent in wisdom to demanding that the Israelis build a new Jewish Temple right between the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa.  Let's do better than this!

The Temple Mount is the site of the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.  Well, that Temple is gone.  And I think it would indeed be a crime (although not all that big a crime) to knock down the Dome of the Rock and rebuild the Temple to some genuine, sophisticated, and modern Deities.<br /><br />Well, this book explains how some people want to discover where the First and Second Jewish Temples, which actually predate the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, stood.  It discusses some religious fanatics who want to rebuild the Jewish Temple.  It talks about Christians and Muslims as well.<br /><br />I could say that we wouldn't have this problem if we'd just left the Temple to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva alone.  And that this entire issue is Their revenge on us for abandoning Them in favor of the ridiculous monotheist god.  But I won't do that.<br /><br />Now, I do, of course, think it would be a crime if the Jews simply knocked down the Dome of the Rock and rebuilt their Temple in its place.  But I think there is little risk of that happening soon.  And I think that the claim that such a move would risk a world war is more than a bit of an exaggeration.  Anything could trigger some events that could have serious consequences.  But Gorenberg appears to put way too much importance on the Temple Mount.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a few religious Jews and some assorted Jewish nationalists are thinking about building a new Temple.  Now, Gorenberg does point out that the religious fanatics are rather crazy.  But he managed to convince me that he's at least as crazy as they are.<br /><br />First, it ought to be easy to resolve the question of the Dome of the Rock: unless there is a very good reason to remove it, simply leave it there!  And I see no very good reason.  Here, Gorenberg is correct to hope that we can all put our fights behind us and not kill each other over such issues.  But there is one minor problem that still needs to be addressed.<br /><br />That problem is simple: it will not bring peace to say, \\"Let's all put the past behind us and quit fighting.  Since we no longer care about the Temple Mount, I'll take it and do what I please with it.  Since nobody cares about it any more, we ought to let me win!\\"<br /><br />That will not work.<br /><br />That is what would happen if we tore down the Dome of the Rock to build a Pagan, Jewish, or Christian Temple.  But is there a chance that we'll have the same problem if we give everything to the Muslims?<br /><br />I think there is.  And I think Gorenberg fails to admit this at all.<br /><br />The problem is simple.  Hindus have temples.  The Bahai have a splendid temple, in Haifa.  All sorts of religions have their special sites.  And no matter how silly Gorenberg thinks it is, Judaism is a temple-based religion.  If even a few Jews want to rebuild their temple, I think they'll do it eventually.  If that means tearing down the Dome of the Rock, that will annoy the Muslims.  If it means not building a temple at all, the issue suddenly leaves the world of religion for that of human rights: Muslims have no right to demand that people of some other religion be precluded from having a temple.<br /><br />I think an obvious possible solution (not the only one) is for the Jews to resolve the issue by building a temple somewhere else, say on Mount Scopus.  But I think Gorenberg is crazier than the fundamentalists if he says that the only reasonable solution is to agree to fundamentalist demands to keep the Jews, but no others, from having a temple at all.re is one minor problem that still needs to be addressed.   <br /> <br />That problem is simple: it will not bring peace to say, \\"Let's all put the past behind us and quit fighting.

Yes, there are some facts in it.  You see some trees here and there.  But whole forests are left out elsewhere.  Rodinson says very little about the Peel Plan and the British White Paper, and what he does say is very misleading.  There are few details about the Jewish fight for independence from Britain.  He basically denies the history of Jews in the Levant from AD 135 until late in the nineteenth century.<br /><br />When we get to the Six-Day War, Rodinson makes excuse after excuse for Arab violence.  The best is the following example of illogic:<br /><br />\\"In the absence of any specific international convention, was any state obliged to grant passage, through its coastal waters extending less than two miles from its shores, to strategic material intended for another state with which it is legally at war?\\"<br /><br />This is unbelievable.  The closure of the Straits of Tiran was a clear act of war on Egypt's part.  Now, Rodinson makes the preposterous argument that Israel had no right to attack Egypt because it was already at war with it!  That is just a taste of the bias we see throughout this book.<br /><br />Rodinson has a reason to pretend that Jews had no connection to the Levant for more than 1700 years.  He wants to say that Jews were an alien people settling on someone else's land.  Okay.  Would he say that about the Russians in Russia?  After all, much of central Russia was depopulated by the Mongols.  Clearly, such reasoning would make it Mongol land in perpetuity, even though very few Mongols ever lived there.<br /><br />This is pure racism on Rodinson's part.  It seems that to him, Arabs are Real Humans who can live anywhere.  Why shouldn't they?  Meanwhile, Jews (and maybe Pagans?) are subhumans who can't live anywhere near Real Humans.  After all, the Real Humans might not like that!  If subhumans get kicked out of a land, they can't return.  If they do return, and buy land at high prices, it is Right to steal it from them.  If that is what you think human civilization needs, fine.  You still ought to buy some other book that tells the whole story, though.  I find Rodinson's attitude outrageous.  Still, the biggest problem with the book is that it messes up the history.<br /><br />Rodinson does not care that when the population of the region was high, the Jews were the majority.  Nor does he care that the Jewish presence in the Levant never vanished, that most Jews considered Jerusalem their capital, and that significant decisions about Judaism were made in Jerusalem for most of the time period between 135 AD and the nineteenth century.  This does not matter much, but Rodinson implies that it does matter, and then pretends it isn't true.<br /><br />Rodinson says that he has been accused of not giving the ancient Jewish ties to Israel enough credit.  That's another misleading statement.  Rodinson's real problem is not realizing that no matter who the Jews were, they had a desire to buy Levantine land, they bought Levantine land, they developed Levantine land, and they made good use of Levantine land.  If we are to have human rights, those Jews needed to be able to keep their lives, liberty, and property.  That is what Rodinson fails to say.  Instead, he mumbles something about Jews having rights (to life, liberty, and property?) and Arabs having rights (to rob, ban, evict, slander, and murder Jews?).  And that these rights are in conflict.  But the truth is that the rights of Arabs to life, liberty, and property are not in conflict with the rights of Jews to life, liberty, and property.

One can accidentally cite what turns out to be a lie that has slipped into the international information supply.  One can simply \\"forget\\" to search through works that might refute one's thesis.  One can cite dubious claims, recklessly disregarding the inconsistencies between them and plenty of other information.  But in the case of David Irving, the problem is fraud, where there is actual falsification of the historical record.<br /><br />Now, any work can be used in part to taunt others.  But it seems to me that in the case of denying what happened to so many Jews in World War II, a primary goal must be to taunt people.  Too many people are too aware of the truth for deceit to be the whole plan.  The liars know they are lying, and they know that many others know it as well.<br /><br />So I wondered what would happen in this trial.  Could liars truly get away with anything?  And the answer in this case was no.<br /><br />It's important to realize that David Irving was not the defendant in some sort of case to censor his lies.  If that had been the situation, some folks would have raised issues of freedom of speech.  However, Irving was actually suing Lipstadt for defamation.  If anyone's right to free speech was threatened, it was Lipstadt's.<br /><br />As one who strongly opposes antischolarly lies, I found this book very interesting.  And I was not surprised to see how bad an impression Irving made in court.  After Irving lost, even the Guardian had as a headline, \\"Irving: Confined to History as a Racist Liar.\\"<br /><br />Lipstadt explains that the actual falsifiers of history are not the issue.  \\"Though the battle against our opponents is exceptionally important, the opponents themselves are not.  Their arguments make as much sense as flat-earth theory.  However, in dramatic contrast to flat-earthers, they can cause tremendous pain and damage.\\"  And we see some of that in the reactions of some of the survivors of death camps.<br /><br />I wondered if Lipstadt would make any mention of the stunning number of lies that are in print about the Middle East.  She did.  Lipstadt naturally mentioned Holocaust denial on the part of Mahmoud Abbas and Abdel Aziz Rantisi.  But she also noted, um, Nobel Laureate Yasir Arafat's denial of any connection between the Jewish people and the land of Israel.  As well as the incresed status of various blood libel myths and the \\"Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\\"  In addition, she explains that one of Arafat's fellow Nobel Laureates, Jose Saramago, compared Arabs in the Levant with Jews at Auschwitz.  And that Tom Paulin called Yeshan Jews \\"Nazis and racists\\" who \\"ought to be shot dead.\\"<br /><br />Now, what is to be done with the liars?  Must they be refuted?  Lipstadt says yes.  And she says it is important to leave them dressed \\"in the jester's costume.\\"  I agree.  At some point, the entire scholarly endeavor of our civilization will be in jeopardy if we can't pass proper judgment on such absurd lies.<br /><br />I recommend this book.t would make any mention of the stunning number of lies that are in print about the Middle East.

It begins with a summary of the story of Arkansas' Act 590.  Next is an introduction by Ashley Montagu, who points out that the creationists \\"are in no sense scientists.\\"  After that is a superb article by Kenneth Miller.  Miller shows how radioactive dating shows the age of the Earth's minerals.  And he explains that had the Earth really been created 10,000 years ago, radioactive dating would prove it.  He mentions that if the Universe was only 10,000 years old, we'd also see only 10,000 years of bombardment of the lunar regolith, and the most distant star in the night sky would be no more than 10,000 light years away.  And he makes the excellent point that if we, right now, are not smart enough to think of a mechanism that explains life or existence, we need not give up and say that some complex creator is responsible.  For all we know, not too many decades from now, we will think of such a mechanism.  And even if we do not, that doesn't prove much.<br /><br />Robert Root-Bernstein then has a fine article on what a scientific theory is.  George Marsden explains the nature of fundamentalist views of science.  And Stephen Jay Gould has two short articles, where he explains that evolution is indeed a fact.  By contrast, the precise mechanisms for evolution, including the exact role of natural selection are still being debated.  Laurie Godfrey's article shows the amount of distortion in creationist arguments.<br /><br />Isaac Asimov has an excellent article on why creationism is indeed a threat.  As he puts it, \\"there are numerous cases of societies in which the armies of the night have ridden triumphantly over minorities in order to establish a powerful orthodoxy which dictates official thought.

Probably.  But just to show everyone that I am not only tolerant and soft-hearted, but generous, I'll give this book not just one, but two stars!<br /><br />You see, there are plenty of facts in this small book.  In addition to the misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense which it does indeed abound with.<br /><br />Shlaim claims that the 1973 Yom Kippur War broke the diplomatic stalemate in the region and led to peace.  He's not the only one to have said this.  But I wouldn't consider saying something like this on a dare.  I'd be laughed out of town!  Could I say with a straight face that the way to start negotiations towards peace is to launch a war of aggression against a neighbor?  No.  And just how strong is the peace between Egypt and Israel anyway?  Not very.  It is more a cease-fire than a peace, with a constant barrage of anti-Israeli propaganda from the Egyptian side.<br /><br />After that, we see Shlaim explain that land-poor Israel can have territory or peace.  Really?  I think it is more reasonable for those who want peace to permit land-poor nations to buy or keep something closer to their fair share of land.  In my opinion, Israel is more likely to have both territory and peace or neither of them than one or the other.  And the author says that Israel can have territory or American support.  Again, this could well be a false choice.  Even if Israel, for some reason, can not have both American support and territory, why ought one expect it to have American support if it does not have territory?<br /><br />Shlaim sums up the problem of the Arabs versus the Jews.  Security pleases the Jews.  Fairness pleases the Arabs.  I wish this were true.<br /><br />Let's see.  Fairness.  Does that mean letting everyone, including Jews and Arabs, buy land throughout the region and keep it?  Does that mean a Truth and Reconciliation session or two where the Arabs can apologize for their violence and aggression against Levantine Jews?  Sounds fair to me!  Shlaim is totally out of line to pretend that it is unfair to not steal Jewish land, or that it is unfair to allow Israel to stay on the map.<br /><br />As for the Oslo peace accords, Shlaim praises them as the beginning of a new era.  Plenty of people were extremely suspicious of Oslo.  Shlaim was wrong here.  And those who were suspicious of Oslo generally had the right reasons to be suspicious.  I think that ought to make us more than a little suspicious of Shlaim.<br /><br />Now, what does Shlaim recommend?  It is simple.  America is simply too much in favor of Israel!  Shlaim thinks we need a more \\"even-handed\\" approach.  And that (this was written before 9/11) America ought not \\"bolster Israel as a strategic partner in an unwinnable war against an imaginary Islamic threat.\\"  Wow.  Imaginary.  But unbeatable.  Shlaim really took a strong view here.  I think 9/11 showed that we're dealing with a real, not an imaginary threat.  And in the long run, why shouldn't a war in favor of truth, justice, and human rights be winnable?  I see no reason to give up without even trying.<br /><br />If you want to learn about war and peace in the Middle East, try some other book., buy land throughout the region and keep it?

Well, not if you believe our Founding Fathers, including George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and Benjamin Franklin.  They argued for complete separation of church and state.  And Wills is actually quite good at telling us what Madison, the most important of them in this regard, said.<br /><br />But America does have plenty of Christians.  And Wills claims (in 1990) that polls show nine out of ten Americans believe in god.  As a Polytheist who regards such a belief atheistic, I find that a discouraging statistic, but that does not mean it is untrue.<br /><br />Wills also argues that an atheist (who does not believe in any Goddesses or Gods, not even the monotheist one) would have no chance of being elected President (presumably being a candidate without a prayer).  Given what Adams and Jefferson said about Christianity in their letters to each other, I doubt that either of their positions would get them elected today.<br /><br />Wills discusses the issue of the words in our Pledge of Allegiance, including the reference to the monotheist god.  I do think symbols are important.  Our flag does not have a Christian Cross on it, and that's intentional.  And I do not understand either side in this dispute.  Do the Christians really want to be on the wrong side of Madison's arguments and demand that Polytheists refer to the monotheist god?  Do non-monotheists really want to appear unpatriotic by refusing to salute their own flag because of these words?<br /><br />The author then moves into the debate over Darwinian evolution.  And he contrasts William Jennings Bryan at the Scopes trial not so much with Clarence Darrow as with H. L. Mencken.  Willis is quick to criticize Mencken's completely politically incorrect attacks on Women, Jews, and Blacks.  Well, maybe I am just too tolerant.  I agree that Mencken's style was like Nietzsche's.  But I find their works thought-provoking rather than parts of a demonic theology!<br /><br />Wills then claims that the real winners of the Scopes trial were not the Darwinians.  He is right about that.  After the trial, the quality of American biology textbooks went way down.  Wills says \\"it was not Scopes that put evolution in the schools, but Sputnik.\\"  That is true.  The author then argues in favor of putting creationism into the science classroom.  I am disappointed with Wills for wanting to do this.  We're not talking about a ritual Pledge to our Flag here.  We're talking about teaching falsehoods in science classes.  Shame on him!<br /><br />There is also a discussion of Jesus, including the virgin birth, miracles, and resurrection.  By the way, I have always thought these made Jesus less heroic and more attackable.  After all, without any of this, who would dream of comparing Jesus with powerful people such as Stalin or Mohammed or Julius Caesar?  Jesus would be a simple hero and no one would find cause to demonize him.<br /><br />Wills is not afraid to talk about abortions and a Woman's Right to Choose.  My only comment on this is to say that I can't see an argument for an embryo being sacred in the first few hours after fertilization, before we even know if it will be twins or not.<br /><br />It is an interesting book, but the comments about creationist arguments are simply wrong.  Even if Wills is being sincere and merely in error here (rather than being reckless or dishonest), I can't give him more than one star for this book after that.Wills then claims that the real winners of the Scopes trial were not the Darwinians.

Next is a discussion of the age of the Earth.  Yes, it is a \\"little indelicate\\" to ask the Earth for her age, but we do that anyway.<br /><br />After that, we get into some early speculations about the origin of life, including the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis.  This involved a reducing atmosphere and a prebiotic \\"soup.\\"  Some of its assumptions now appear invalid.  Shapiro also attacks the fact that the step from abiotic to biotic forms is too quick, requiring a stroke of luck which is far more than astronomical, even worse than the numbers Hoyle and Wickramasinghe came up with.  We can get better numbers just by producing a random replicator rather than an enitre organism, but that still can't be done spontaneously.  Theories that simply produce nucleic acids by chance don't make sense.  We need to find something that gets us there another way, with more plausible steps.  Perhaps there is a substrate that can lock the ingredients in place, where they can evolve chemically.  And the author mentions some ideas here.  I think the most important point should be that it is always dangerous to say that a process can't happen because you haven't thought of a mechanism for it yet!  A mechanism may well exist.  You or someone else may think of such a mechanism in the future.<br /><br />Shapiro then gets to Hoyle and Wickramasinghe's ideas about life reaching Earth from outer space.  And maybe the best part of the book is the way he shoots down some of their specific ideas and claims on the subject.  This, of course, does not disprove the idea that life on Earth came from outer space (although at even odds, I'd bet against it).  It just means that Hoyle went badly astray here.<br /><br />After that is a discussion of creationism, where the author points out that creationists are \\"not so much interested in advocating the practice of religion, which they can do in many other, less controversial ways, but rather are trying to subvert the practice of science in areas where the conclusions reached by scientists do not please them.\\"  Shapiro also shows that the creationists really have no evidence to base their views on.  Making snide comments about the evidence of others does not suffice to constitute evidence for their own views.<br /><br />Shapiro then returns to the question of which came first, nucleic acids or proteins.  He feels the nucleic acids couldn't have been first, and I agree, although I feel far less sure about it than he does.  He concludes that life appears to have originated on Earth, and that the complicated molecules and structures that we observe in life today are the result of a long process of evolution.  That's a sensible conclusion.  He adds some speculations about substrates which are plausible as well.<br /><br />I recommend this book.nists are \\"not so much interested in advocating the practice of religion, which they can do in many other, less controversial ways, but rather are trying to subvert the practice of science in areas where the conclusions reached by scientists do not please them.\\"  Shapiro also shows that the creationists really have no evidence to base their views on.

But I think the author is dealing with an important issue here, and we ought to think about what he's saying, right or wrong.<br /><br />Is Iran well on its way to acquiring the technology to produce nuclear weapons?  The author thinks so, and he has some evidence for it.  My guess is that he's basically right about this.  Would Iran use such weapons as a threat?  Probably, at least under some circumstances.  Would Iran simply use such weapons to launch what might be considered an unprovoked attack on the United States, or to make part or all of Israel uninhabitable?  I have no idea.  But given what we know about Iran, there is reason to suspect that it might.  Iran is supporting anti-Western terror, mostly against Israel, right now.<br /><br />Corsi says that the Kerry-Edwards team, had it been elected, would have been particularly inept at dealing with this issue.  I disagree.  In any case, this is a problem that affects all Americans, of all parties.  Sooner or later, we'll all try to come to grips with it, and we'll do that well or poorly as a nation.<br /><br />The book makes some good points about Israel.  Israel is simply a convenient \\"Western\\" target.  Rather than causing problems in the region, it is simply threatened by those who are causing problems.  Now, should Israel launch an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, as it did in the case of Iraq?  Corsi thinks it may do so, and that we ought to support it if it does.  I think Israel is unlikely to do that, and we need to try to find another way to deal with Iran's potential nuclear capability than to ask Israel to handle it.<br /><br />Corsi is at his best when he explains what the effects might be of a nuclear weapon being detonated in, say, New York.  There are some questions about all this, of course.  Smuggling a bomb into New York may not be so easy.  Unlike the surprise of 9/11, this time, we might get lucky, stumble upon the plot, and stop it.  Even if we didn't, it might be difficult for any nation or terror group to hit us more than a few times before we figured out a way to stop it.  And the casualties from one bomb might be substantially less than the case Corsi uses as an example (of course, the absolute worst case bomb would by a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb, which would create substantially more carnage than Corsi's example).<br /><br />Still, a few bombs, or even one bomb, could wreak plenty of havoc.  And Corsi makes a very good point here.  Suppose just one bomb were detonated, say in New York City.  That would cause enormous damage.  And it would weaken our nation.  We might retaliate, and we might not.  But Corsi explains that the damage we incurred would not be lessened even if we did retaliate.  That includes the loss of confidence about the future those of us who survived would have.  Terrorist nuclear weapons, if detonated, are going to have dramatic consequences, mostly very negative for the targeted nations.  Maybe now is indeed the time for us to think carefully about how to reduce the chances of this happening.<br /><br />Others might have said that this is the time to address the causes of such threats, and concluded (perversely) that this is the time to appease those who may threaten us.  Corsi, of course, has a very dim view of appeasement here.  So do I.<br /><br />What is to be done?  I'm not sure, and this book didn't convince me what the best answer is.  But I do know that we'd all be much safer were Iran and a few other nations less fanatical and more responsible.ult for any nation or terror group to hit us more than a few times before we figured out a way to stop it.

And this book, with facts and plenty of anecdotal material, is quite interesting.<br /><br />We see how in Sinai, the Israelis were improperly prepared, slow to react to the threats, managed to waste a day due to poor coordination, yet did get around to counterattacking and getting the upper hand.  And we see how Israel's position in the Golan was critical.  Losing the Golan could have meant having much of northeastern Israel being overrun rather quickly, having far more casualties, and being forced to withdraw forces from Sinai in an attempt to protect the northern front.<br /><br />And we see the issue of the use of nuclear weapons.  Would Israel have actually used nuclear weapons?  I certainly do not know.  But it appears that Israel was quite ready to threaten to use them, either to give their enemies pause or to convince the United States to give Israel a significant amount of arms, rapidly.<br /><br />But what about the element of surprise?<br /><br />It seems to me that in wartime, surprise is surprisingly easy to achieve.  The German attacks of May, 1940, in the middle of a declared war, seemed to catch France and Britain off-guard.  The German attack on the Soviet Union, in June of 1941, something a huge number of people obviously saw coming, clearly caught the Soviets off-guard.  Pearl Harbor, at a time of very high tension between the United States and Japan, caught us off-guard.  D-day caught the Germans off-guard.  I suspect that the Inchon landing in the Korean War was a big surprise too.  And with the Middle East clearly heading towards all-out war in June 1967, the Egyptians were shockingly unprepared for Israel's warplanes.  So it is no surprise that even with all sorts of people betting on war (some of whom had good reasons to be sure about it) in 1973, Israel wasn't sure the war was coming until it actually started.  Blum correctly implies that Israel ought to have done a little better here, but I think we're missing the perspective of just how tough it is to do that.<br /><br />More recently, we in the United States were taken by surprise by the events of September 11, 2001, even though once again, there was plenty of information that ought to have warned us.<br /><br />Blum shows how Shabtai Brill deduced days in advance of the attack that war was coming.  I'm sure he wasn't the only one who was ignored.  IDF reserve general Rahavam Ze'evi said that Israeli intelligence had 500 indicators that an attack was imminent, but Israel's assessment still had a big element of doubt.  Blum does cast some blame on a bad Israeli intelligence source, but obviously this is just one element of a not very surprising part of the story.<br /><br />I think readers of this book may also want to look at what Bruce Brill has to say.  His article in the May, 1994 issue of Midstream, is readily available for free on the internet.  Brill quotes Prime Minister Golda Meir, who felt that an attack had to be imminent, given the rushed exodus of Soviet advisor's families on the night of Thursday, October 4.  Meir was not the only one who thought so.  That day (afternoon in the US, very late at night in Israel) Brill says that he himself got a phone call from his supervisor at the United States National Security Agency, who told him that the war would start Saturday.<br /><br />Given that all sorts of people were aware that war was coming and that war did indeed start as expected, I see no reason to disbelieve Bruce Brill about what he was told and when he was told it.  However, Brill concludes from this that the United States intentionally held back information from Israel.  I think that is too strong a conclusion.  Just as Israel had a tough time deciding what to do with its information, I'm sure the United States had some problems deciding what to tell Israel.  But I can see how some folks inIsrael might afterwards have decided that they would rather know what we know outright (via espionage if necessary) than hope to be told what we know.<br /><br />In any case, Blum's book is certainly one to read to learn more about the Yom Kippur War.hat we know outright (via espionage if necessary) than hope to be told what we know.

Well, that depends on the religion.  If a religion insists on stating falsehoods or dubious propositions as facts, there is going to be a problem.  If it challenges the entire idea of seeking truth, there will be a problem.  Not just with science, but with scholarship in general.  And that will extend to every aspect of human endeavor.  Still, I would argue that religions do not always challenge science or dispute known facts.  Nor do they need to.<br /><br />Well, what do the articles in this book have to say about it?  Norman and Lucia Hall point out that many religious people accept some scientific findings for their practical value but are suspicious of the scientific method.  Delos McKown points out that Christianity in particular is simply fraudulent.  Bertrand Russell, surely no defender of Christianity, feels that religions can avoid challenging scholarship on matters of fact, and that they can also cure themselves of the desire to persecute (which is one of the reasons for challenging scholarship in the first place).<br /><br />There is an article by Albert Einstein, which I won't comment on.  And then we get into a section on how the universe originated.  I do think that there is some overlap between science and philosophy here.  Anyway, there is an article by Howard Slusher, who argues in favor of a young universe (several thousand years old).  It is pure nonsense.  I'm outraged that anyone would make such claims.  To back up his \\"argument,\\" Slusher looks for disagreements among those who realize that the universe is much older.  In any case, the truth is that we know that the universe used to be much denser and hotter.  When was it truly hot?  Somewhere between 10 billion and 20 billion years ago.  We know this from the Hubble expansion, from the 2.7 Kelvin blackbody radiation, and most impressively, from the Helium content everywhere corresponding to Big Bang nucleosynthesis.  I think if a religion wants to take sides on this issue, it had better take the side of truth, not falsehood.<br /><br />Now, was the universe created by accident or design?  Victor Stenger makes a powerful argument that the universe was never created.  It probably came about by chance.  Once we postulate that the universe was \\"created,\\" we're already on the wrong side of Occam's Razor.  I'm not sure I'm completely convinced, but it is a strong argument.  Holmes Ralston III argues for creation by design, but this has a couple of big problems.  First, who created the creator?  And second, why ought it surprise us that we are in a universe which happens to support life?  Whether the universe was designed or not, that needs to be the case.<br /><br />Robert Jastrow and Isaac Asimov have articles about whether the universe could have been created by God.  Jastrow's article implies that scientists used to believe that the universe had no beginning, but the Bible turned out to be right: the universe did have a beginning, and scientists are now unhappy because they don't like the Bible!  I think this is an irrelevant taunt.  Asimov says that logically speaking, the universe must be unchanging, changing cyclically, or must be changing (presumably with a birth and a death).  I'm not so sure about this either!  But I do think it is truly silly to picture a complex god as a First Cause!<br /><br />There is a section about the origin of life.  That includes a very weak argument against evolution from Donald Chittick, and a solid defense of evolution as a scientific fact from Stephen Gould.  But there is no article that specifically gets into scientific views of the origin of life as opposed to evolution of life after it got started.<br /><br />The final articles are about science, religion, and ethics.  Well, science has produced bombs, and some scientists have even been war criminals.  Religion has fared badly as well, with many Saints abetting mass murder.  What is to be done?  I'll tell you what.  Ethics is impossible without recognizing that truth is an inherent value.  Those who actively fight truth will discover that they have difficulties being ethical.  So I think Science, with its respect for truth, may have an edge here.'ll tell you what.  Ethics is impossible without recognizing that truth is an inherent value.

It is clearly written with prospective and actual studio potters in mind.<br /><br />The book originally came out in 1992, and is now in its fourth edition.  And, after mentioning some safety issues, it has plenty of instructional material on how to shape clay, and what tools to use.  There are sections on hand building: pinching, coil building, and slab building.  Then there's plenty about the technique of \\"throwing\\" clay on a potter's wheel, with nice sequences of photos.  This takes plenty of skill and practice!  As the author says, the wheel is very sensuous, rhythmic, and hypnotic.  Peterson is always warning us to treat clay properly: if you attack it in one way and then hit  it from another direction in the same place, you may find cracks there in firing, induced by the strains you imposed on it.  It's simply wrong to overwork clay.<br /><br />Still, many potters and artists like to produce many objects with the same overall shape.  And that means making and using molds made from plaster, and making casting slips, so Peterson shows us quite a bit about these.  After this comes a discussion of decoration.  This involves artistry and visualization.<br /><br />There is a good discussion of types of clays, and explanations of what earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain are.  We're shown different types of clay bodies, including terra sigillata and raku (a process which requires a clay body that has some dirt mixed in with it to make it porous enough to avoid thermal shock).  And there is a wonderful chapter on glazes.  Following that, there is plenty about kilns and firing, including using cones, inconel tubes, and pyrometers to measure temperature.<br /><br />A technical section explains how to do calculations on glazes, and there are charts of coefficients of expansion, data on frits, color charts of clay and glaze combinations, and much more.<br /><br />There is a historical overview, which includes a discussion of the studio potter movement and the contributions to it from Bernard Leach and Shoji Hamada.  And we see some of the work of Maria Martinez and Lucy Lewis in Pueblo Indian ceramics.  There is also an excellent portfolio of interesting works.  I especially like some of the low-fire ones.<br /><br />This is a very useful resource and I highly recommend it.ovement and the contributions to it from Bernard Leach and Shoji Hamada.

Part of the reason is that it was outlawed in many events.  I think the proper response to that is to play bridge exclusively in events where such a logical system is allowed.<br /><br />This is by no means an ideal bidding system.  But it is a very good one.  No, there was no information theory analysis done to make best use of bidding room.  But I still like it.  It has been around for about fifty years, and it is high time for it to be accepted everywhere.<br /><br />With balanced distributions, points are the most important.  With 12-16, you bid an artifical one club.  17-20 is one no trump.  And with 21-26 you bid one club, but jump on the second round to show that you do not have the 12-16 one club.  One diamond is an artificial negative response to one club.<br /><br />When you want to play in a suit contract, distribution is more important than points.  Those of us who know the law of total tricks realize that points are truly secondary to knowing the number of trumps each side has.  In this system, you play canape, which means bidding the shorter suit first and the longer one second.  If you have long hearts with diamonds as your second suit, you open one diamond.  After a one heart response, one no trump shows long hearts and a weak hand, two hearts shows long hearts and a strong hand, and three hearts is like a reverse, long hearts and a very strong hand.<br /><br />When your second suit is clubs, you have a problem, because the one club opening is taken.  So with hearts and clubs, you open two hearts, with spades and hearts, you open two spades.  With diamonds and clubs, you open two no trump!  With all these suit openers, you count losers as well as points (losers are at least as important).  Opening bids of two clubs and two diamonds are used to describe three-suited hands.<br /><br />Slam bidding has a Roman twist, the infamous Roman Asking Bids (often mispronounced \\"Roaming Ashcan Bids\\").  These bids ask about controls in a specific suit.  The response tells everyone at the table whether a suit is wide open or not.  Blackwood is, of course, replaced by Roman Blackwood.<br /><br />I know most folks will strongly disagree with me, but I think this is an ideal system for total beginners, not just World Champions.  The authors tend to support this, noting that for beginners, errors in judgment are more frequent than lapses of memory.  This system gives one less leeway than most others, which is a good idea!<br /><br />The book concludes with some useful quizzes, followed by some excellent examples of the Roman Club in action in World Championship play.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.ispronounced \\"Roaming Ashcan Bids\\").

Yes, there is plenty of oil in the Middle East.  And it is controlled by Middle Eastern nations that get into fights.<br /><br />And yes, the twin towers were destroyed on September 11, 2001.<br /><br />How long will it be before we run out of oil?  That's not at all clear.  But sure, we ought to try to conserve it, if only to be at less risk of blackmail from oil-producing nations.  Not to mention the deleterious effects on the environment if we use up oil too fast.  And the shock to the worldwide economy if we pretty much run out.<br /><br />Now, what about 9/11?  Did America mess up by not catching the terrorists?  Yes.  Did we do it on purpose, with our own administration in on the attack?  Well, let's think about it.  We could stage an attack on ourselves in some circumstances.  But this sure doesn't look like one of them.  And the evidence Ruppert has for us is completely unconvincing.<br /><br />Most mistakes are unintentional.  I think most people in our government would react to Ruppert's book with something like, \\"that just isn't how our government operates.\\"  And maybe some stronger comments as well.<br /><br />I like scholarship, and I do not like lies.  So I find this book to be part of the problem: it is simply too misleading.<br /><br />Let's see how this book does when it discusses Israel, a topic on which plenty of information is available.  Is there any attempt at honesty here, or just some blatant attempts to mislead us?  It turns out to be the latter.  First, Ruppert points out that \\"members of the Bush administration have exceptionally close ties with the Israeli government.\\"  That is misleading.  Then he continues with, \\"for centuries, Muslims and Jews lived side by side in relative tranquility in the Middle East.\\"  Yes, and in the American South, for years, slave owners and slaves lived side by side in relative tranquility.  Ruppert then speculates that Israel was involved in 9/11 along with our administration.  I find that very hard to believe.  I see no motive, and I see too much risk of getting caught.  Plus, there's no evidence, and there's no logical follow-up to such acts.<br /><br />To top it off, Ruppert takes some intentionally inaccurate and misleading shots at Israel.  He says Israel has violated more UN resolutions than Iraq.  Well, Israel certainly has been on the wrong side of more UN resolutions than Iraq, as I constantly point out.  But the problem is with the UN, not with Israel.  Then Ruppert says that Israel started wars, committed atrocities against civilians, invaded and violated nations, occupied nations for years, and illegally annexed territory!  That basically writes the history of racist Arab aggression against human rights for Jews in the region backwards, blaming the victims and praising the villains.  And Ruppert goes on from there, saying that Ariel Sharon \\"narrowly escaped (on a technicality) prosecution in Belgium.\\"  It seems to me that Ruppert is a little too eager to put Israel on trial for all mishaps in the Middle East. Meanwhile, when a ship, the Karine A, is discovered loaded with weapons to be used by terrorists against Israel, Ruppert dismisses this as manipulative Israeli propaganda.<br /><br />This book is not good reporting; it isn't scholarship.  It is a bunch of absurd taunts., and I see too much risk of getting caught.  Plus, there's no evidence, and there's no logical follow-up to such acts.

The Stern Gang was characterized by its unwavering fight against British colonial rule in the Levant, its seemingly quixotic tendency to shoot it out with the cops, its eagerness to ask the Nazis to spare Jews from death, and its murders of two key bad guys: Lord Moyne and Count Bernadotte.  Not to mention \\"the assault on the barracks of the British air-borne division, in which seven of His Majesty's soldiers were cold-bloodedly killed.\\"<br /><br />Were these criminal acts justified?  No.  But with Nazis killing Jews in huge numbers, it is no surprise that some Jews would ask them to stop, and offer to do pretty much anything in return.  It is also no surprise that the Nazis refused such a deal.  In addition, during World War Two, the British rulers of the area were knowingly condemning enormous numbers of Jews to their deaths by illegally closing the Levant to refugees, and one reason the British did this was that there was an insufficiently violent response on the part of the Jews.  At that point, justification was no longer the most important issue to Jewish desperados.<br /><br />Cohen joined the Stern Gang during World War Two, and that meant becoming a criminal.  It meant stealing things.  It meant putting up illegal posters.  It meant that if you were followed by a suspicious looking man, you'd kick him in the groin and run away (and if he then started shooting at you, you might well shoot back).<br /><br />The author examines what it means not just to be an outlawed fighter, but an outlawed Woman Fighter.  To risk being arrested and have the judge call you \\"a silly thoughtless young girl\\" rather than give you credit for being a serious combatant.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed Cohen's descriptive powers.  Typical of her style is \\"Her sentences rocketed in every direction.  Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.  She supplied air enough for only the first half of each sentence, the second was on its own.\\"  And it is easy to imagine her introductory words on the air, \\"This is the Voice of the Hebrew Underground!  This is the radio station of the Freedom Fighters of Israel!\\"<br /><br />We find out plenty of details about some of the Stern Gang's, um, adventures.  And about Cohen's capture by British authorities.  Cohen tried to escape by running away from the Bethlehem prison prior to her trial, but she was pursued by guards, shot and wounded, and recaptured.  The British sentenced her to seven years for illegal possession of weapons and for illegal possession of a radio transmitter.  Cohen spent well over a year in prison, finally making her escape after managing to get herself transferred to a Jerusalem hospital.<br /><br />For years, the Stern Gang said that the British would leave.  Well, they did.  In 1948.  And it made me think about what we all would be saying had they left ten years earlier, permitting many of Jews who died in World War Two to survive.descriptive powers.

But there are also some good points.<br /><br />What are some aspects of modernity?  Well, we're technologically better off than we were just a few centuries ago.  And getting there has involved scholarship, progress, and cooperation.  I think that recognizing that truth is an inherent value has sparked much of the progress.  Now, truth can be used as one of the weapons in the arsenal of a tyrant, and it can result in acquiring the ability to cause more carnage in wars, but the triumph of Untruth would get rid of all the progress we've made.<br /><br />The author discusses Positivism quite a bit, and I see no reason to do this.  Positivism focuses on empirical truth, so it isn't the problem.  We know empirically that people can make errors, so having faith that those who seek truth will be free from error is ill-advised.  It seems to me that Gray is ready to attack and discard Positivism simply because it might lead to error.  But that would also get rid of scholarship and progress.<br /><br />Well, given all this, why am I giving this book a, um, positive review?<br /><br />I think Gray does make a few interesting points.  He does point out that Polytheistic Greece and Rome allowed for the fact that humans are varied, and did not insist on a single way to salvation.  And he does point out that a Christian myth is precisely that there is one and only one way to salvation for everyone.<br /><br />While I think Gray is attacking a ridiculous straw man to say that advances in science do not always advance humans socially, he's right about that.  Still, I want to emphasize that his overall point seems wrong: if we were to address social problems in a more scholarly manner, I think we'd probably be better off, not worse off.<br /><br />Now, what about al-Qaeda?  Gray interprets it not so much as a blast from the past, populated by reactionaries representing a Dark Ages religion.  Instead, he sees it more as an outgrowth of a more modern religious belief, shared by the German National Socialists, that our salvation lies in genocide.  Perhaps that is an extreme way to put it, but this is approximately what Gray says.  And I think there may be some truth to this.  Maybe German extremism in the 1930s, along with its propaganda, ought to be compared more carefully with Islamist extremism today, along with its propaganda.<br /><br />One final point that Gray makes is that there is a connection between terrorism and .... something.  But what?  Poverty?  Despair?  Bad karma?  Gray looks at the question of failed states.  Strong, stable, representative, and healthy states are less likely to sponsor terror, and they're certainly less likely to produce it.  Gray thinks that the best environment for producing terror is semi-anarchy.  We ought to think about that as well.shared by the German National Socialists, that our salvation lies in genocide.

I just read two books besides this one.  One was Haim Harari's book about terror and reason in the Middle East.  Another was Brett Goldberg's about Jenin.  And I've been reading articles about the \\"Columbia disaster.\\"  No, not the space shuttle, but Columbia University in New York City and its infamous Middle East Studies department.  The author is a member of this department at Columbia.  He's a signatory of the notorious divestment (from Israel) petition.  He's a defender of fellow Middle East studies department member Joseph Massad, who calls Israel \\"racist,\\" and claims that Zionism is antisemitic!  He's spoken out in favor of a Truth and Reconciliation tribunal in Israel to help achieve peace there (analagous to truth and reconciliation in South Africa).  On this final point, I agree with Mamdani.  We need exactly that.  We need to put the Arab racists in front of the world community and get a big apology from them as well as a guarantee to stop their aggression and antizionist slanders.  Unfortunately, Mamdani would turn this around, put the victims on trial and make them apologize to the thugs.<br /><br />In an age where a small but significant number of Muslims are terrorists and terrorist supporters, it becomes important to separate the sheep from the goats.  Otherwise, all Muslims are going to be suspect.  Mamdani is not helping matters by trying to justify terrorism.<br /><br />Mamdani talks about Jenin in this book.  He quotes Ed Said, saying \\"by what inhumane calculus did Israel's army\\" besiege Jenin \\"and call it a response to terrorist violence?\\"  And he continues by saying that \\"we may never know the story of what happened in Jenin.\\"  Oh, but we know plenty of it from Brett Goldberg's book, and I think everyone ought to read it.  Mamdani seems to want to pretend that book doesn't exist.<br /><br />As for suicide bombers, well, Mamdani wants to find a way to justify what they do.  But why?  What goes around comes around.  Sooner or later, the shoe will be on the other foot, and people will use force against the thugs.  Meanwhile, just what purpose does it serve to create a culture of death and destruction?  Anyway, for reasons best known to Mamdani, we get stuff in this book such as:<br /><br />\\"Suicide bombing needs to be understood as a feature of modern political violence rather than stigmatized as a mark of barbarism.\\"<br /><br />And he goes on to imply that all this violence is simply noble self-defence.  But it isn't.  It is aggression.  It is criminal.<br /><br />Haim Harari, in his book, was not kind to those who intentionally slander Israel.  His recommendation is for people to stand up to the liars and say \\"You are lying.  You are deliberately spreading dangerous, vicious lies.  Lies like these kill.\\"  Now, would it stop people from writing books like these if a few more of us were to say that?  Probably not.  But if enough of us said it often enough, universities such as Columbia would be forced to make a choice between scholarship and propaganda against human rights.er, the shoe will be on the other foot, and people will use force against the thugs.

His interest has been in neutrino interactions and oscillations, solar neutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos, neutrinos as dark matter candidates, neutrino masses, mixing angles and possible decays, models for neutrino mass patterns, and astrophysical and cosmological implications of neutrino properties.  Sounds fascinating!<br /><br />But this book is on a somewhat, um, heavier topic than neutrinos.<br /><br />The author's great-great-grandmother was one of those who lived in Jerusalem in 1844, back when it was a little town in the Syrian province of the Ottoman Empire.  Back when a census showed it had 7120 Jews, 5760 Muslims, and 3390 Christians (by the way, back then, these 7120 Jews all lived in what some folks today mistakenly  call \\"traditionally Arab East Jerusalem\\").<br /><br />Harari was sometimes amazed \\"by the successful penetration of so much fiction into the facts of the Middle East.\\"  He points out that \\"if someone in the world of science is caught even once in a deliberate lie, he or she is excluded, forever, from the scientific community; no scientist would ever listen to or employ him or her again.\\"<br /><br />I think this is what we need to do with those \\"scholars\\" who spread antizionist lies.<br /><br />Harari tells us about what is behind the suicide murders in Israel.  It is money, power, and cold-blooded murderous incitement.  It has nothing to do with poverty and despair.  Now, what does one do about suicide murderers in wartime?  If you are convinced that a man in a heavy coat approaching a big group of children is about to kill a large number of them, do you shoot to kill him?  You don't have much time to decide!  Harari says that one has to use common sense here.  And he's right.  Sooner or later, that is what people will do.  And what does one do, asks Harari, when faced by a bunch of stone-throwing children, right behind whom are a bunch of adults who are shooting at you?  As usual, enemy television is showing you and the children, but not the shooting adults.<br /><br />Harari shows that international organizations that ought to help with such problems have been corrupted, including the United Nations, the International Red Cross, the International Court of Justice, and the UN Human Rights Commission.<br /><br />The author also points out that many in Europe say that Israel is defended by the United States, even though Israel has never been protected by American troops.  Meanwhile, much of Europe's prosperity has been been supported by American troops on European soil, protecting Europe!<br /><br />The author says that the way to defeat the terror networks is to have an absolute united commitment among the nations of the free world, eliminate the ringleaders, isolate or liberate the countries who support the terrorists, emancipate women, ban indoctrination of children, prevent systematic brainwashing by media, and open the relevant countries to the world at large.<br /><br />There are some great lines.  God ought to let the terrorists know that He doesn't exist!  Immediately!  And as for the international organizations that intend to judge Israel, \\"The jury is out.  It better not come back!\\"  Two wrongs do not make a right.  But two Rights (the Arab Far Right and European Far Right) can make a Wrong.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Harari notes that \\"something is very sick with\\" the European Far Left, which \\"spends so much energy attacking Israel without ever protesting any of the true evils coming from the Middle East.\\"<br /><br />There is a good section about the use of the media by the terrorists.  That includes reporting lies as if they were truth and carefully omitting anything that might make the terrorists look bad.  I am convinced that to have anything remotely resembling peace in the region, we need to crack down on these lies, with a full-scale Truth and Reconciliation that includes all the major media.<br /><br />But the lies extend to well-known history.  And Ithink we need to condemn \\"scholarly books\\" that include some of the more preposterous ones.  As Harari says, \\"if I told you that the towers of the World Trade Center never existed, that Julius Caesar was British, and that the American Civil War did not happen, would you ever pay attention to anything else I told you?\\"<br /><br />The author tells of many of the anti-Israeli lies that are told.

But how about a book for biology students?  This one provides 23 interesting articles on evolution, with students and scientists in mind.<br /><br />The first part is on the genetic machinery of evolution.  That starts with an examination of the importance of various types of mutations: deleterious, \\"nearly neutral,\\" neutral, and advantageous.  We see the significance of random drift, and that there is a negative correlation between evolutionary rate and population size.  Next is a discussion of the characteristic footprint left by natural selection in DNA sequences, and how this footprint can be detected from the analysis of intraspecific nucelotide variation.  After that is a paper which addresses the extent and severity of deleterious mutations, and the reduction in overall fitness that ensues from them.  This \\"mutational load\\" is shown to be less than had been previously estimated.  The following topic is gene duplication.  Many of the key evolutionary lineages of multicellular eukaryotes have experienced polyploidization at some point.  Gene duplication clearly plays an important role in genome evolution and in all likelihood in phenotypic evolution as well.  After that comes the issue of gene regulation: how have regulatory sequences evolved, mutated, and drifted?  The section finishes with a paper on the relevance of the human genome project to evolution.  We may find causes of suboptimality, infer nonorthologous gene displacements, learn about the origin of nonhierarchical distributions in character states, infer ancestral character states (my favorite), learn about the relative importance of neutral mutations (as well as of duplications, transportations, and gene and genome shuffling), and learn about the interaction between directional and stabilizing selection.<br /><br />The second part is about molecular variation and evolution.  That includes a discussion of the evolution of virulence in AIDS viruses, the evolution of the plasmodium parasites (which cause malaria), and the evolution of symbioses in insects (the conquest of insect intercellular habitats by bacteria).<br /><br />Part Three deals with the ecological and biogeographic context of evolutionary change.  While evolutionary biology is a study of how organisms evolve, evolutionary ecology is a study of why they evolve.  That means looking at both abiotic and biotic drivers of natural selection.  And we see a little of how a single genotype can produce different phenotypes in different environments.  If there is a predictable change in the environment (such as the annual cycle), genotypes can adapt very well to it (consider the summer diopause of cyclopoids).  Next there are a couple of articles on the evolutionary peculiarities of cyclical parthenogens (species that more or less regularly alternate between sexual and parthenogenetic reproduction).  There are about 15,000 species of cyclical parthenogens, with rotifers and aphids being well-known representatives of them.  After that is an article about how ecosystem-level phenomena (habitat persistence) may shape the dispersal strategies of populations, and what consequences these dispersal strategies may have on gene flow and genetic differentiation of populations.  The final article in the section is on using molecules to understand the distribution of animal and plant diversity.  That means a fascinating tracing the progress of DNA sequences through the Pangea continent era (about 225 million years ago), the production of the Alps, Himalayas, and Andes mountain ranges (all in the past 35 million years or so), the production of the Hawaiian chain of islands (in the past 30 million years), and the series of ice ages in the past two million years.<br /><br />The fourth part has papers on speciation and major evolutionary events.  The first of these is about allopatric speciation (where total geographic isolation of populations causes the formation of different species due to the effects of random genetic divergence).  But how often are these \\"isolated\\" populations truly isolated?  It appears that in many cases, isolation is not complete, and sexual selection plays a major role in the ensuing speciation.  The next paper attempts to summarize the evidence that hybrids are not evolutionary dead ends, but actually a positive source of evolutionary innovations.  That leads to a discussion of mobile DNA sequences, called transposons, which can transpose copies of themselves throughout the genome.  The idea is that hybridization can induce high transposition rates.  That means high mutation and rearrangement rates.  Selection effects and increased fixation by drift in small hybrid populations then lead to introgression or to speciation.  Then there is a paper on cooperation and conflict during two major evolutionary transitions, prokaryotic to eukaryotic and unicellular to multi-cellular.  It is pointed out that natural selection not only fails to maximize fitness in the \\"Prisoner's Dilemma\\" game, it minimizes it.  The next paper discusses the molecular evidence on the origin and phylogenetic relationships among the major groups of vertebrates.  The phylogeny of vertebrates is relatively well known given their fossil record.  The final paper in the section discusses mass extinctions.  Some clades survive with little change in long-term patterns.  Some die.  Others diversify.  Some suffer setbacks and then recover (in some cases, genera disappear from the fossil record prior to the extinction and reappear late in the recovery period).  And some survive the extinction but perish in the recovery (dead clade walking).<br /><br />The last part has four intriguing papers about behavior, evolution, and human affairs.  The first of these is on how evolution may explain play.  After all, it uses up energy to play.  Why is it worth doing?  The next paper is on the evolutionary psychology of human physical attraction and attractiveness.  The third paper is about the genome view on human evolution.  And the final paper is an attempt to find a Darwinian account for human creativity.  Here, the claim is made that we have no way to be sure that Kasparov's method for finding a good chess move is entirely unlike the means exploited by Deep Blue.  Good.  I have now found a statement in this book that I can strongly disagree with and be confident that I am right.  I highly recommend the book in spite of this.e to the effects of random genetic divergence).  But how often are these \\"isolated\\" populations truly isolated?

The reason is that an unscientific debate continues.  Part of the problem is that many people have little understanding of what science is all about.<br /><br />My feeling about the controversy is that we have on one side some educated people who are actually using science to make progress in fields such as medicine that would otherwise be impossible while on the other side are those who complain that all these achievements are indeed impossible.<br /><br />Pigliucci starts with some of the history behind the creationism-evolution debate.  This includes the heresy conviction for James Woodrow in South Carolina in the 1880s, and the Scopes trial of 1925 in Tennessee.  And we see the latter involving a clear case of anti-intellectualism, where William Jennings Bryan appeared to favor majority rule in matters of scientific fact.<br /><br />In Chapter Two, we see David Hume's arguments against intelligent design.  The analogy between the universe and human artifacts is weak.  Intelligence is not the only cause of patterns (consider snowflakes).  Even if intelligent beings do create things today, that does not mean that intelligence created the Universe.  The origin of the Universe may be unique, and thus analogies to it may not be meaningful.  The analogy between a human mind and a divine mind is anthropomorphic and leads to a finite God.  We also see what evolution is.  It is defined as a change in frequencies of the genes found in natural populations.  As a consequence, it can also be seen as gradual descent with modification linking different life forms on Earth.  Evolution itself is not a theory of origins, either of life or of the Universe.<br /><br />The next chapter has an interesting discussion of anti-intellectualism, including \\"post-modernism.\\"  Of course, to my way of thinking, anti-intellectualism simply attacks truth.  However, truth is an inherent value, and in general, those who fight it on principle will not fare as well as those who embrace it.<br /><br />The author then gets into a good discussion of what science is, and what hypotheses, theories, and laws are.  After that he covers eleven specific creationist fallacies, followed by three very misleading creationist claims.  Next is a short chapter that mentions some errors made by scientists.  Scientists can make mistakes, get defrauded, or have error imposed upon them by a government (such as Lysenko in the Soviet Union).  Pigliucci shows that science, being self-correcting, eventually deals with these errors by measuring them against the real world.<br /><br />What recommendations does the author make?  Well, scientists must take a more active role in their communities, and also organize \\"community days.\\"  We need to hire good researchers to do research and good teachers to teach.  There must be continuing education for teachers.  Universities must provide teacher training for professors and graduate students.  Universities ought to have more truly interdisciplinary courses and curricula.  Some textbooks teach too many facts and not enough ideas, and need to be rewritten.  We need more \\"active learning,\\" not lectures in the classroom.  There need to be more \\"open-inquiry\\" exercises.  More emphasis has to be placed on the \\"how\\" of science, not just the \\"what.\\"  Students need to be taught critical thinking, and their writing and communication skills need to be improved.  The use of information technology must engage the student's brain, not bypass it.  Teachers ought to use contoversial subject matter as a stimulus to thinking.<br /><br />I occasionally disagreed with some of what the author said.  But it is an excellent book, and I strongly recommend it.nd in general, those who fight it on principle will not fare as well as those who embrace it.

Oil?  Food?  Water?  Infectious diseases?  Gratutitous terror?<br /><br />This book tries to answer some of these questions.<br /><br />The first main issue is the connection between population and security.  Overpopulated countries with high birth rates are at risk of getting into wars.  They also have potential worries about employment, as well as food and water shortages.<br /><br />What about infectious diseases?  Many people in Western nations can expect over 70 years of healthy life.  But life expectancies in Africa are much less.  How much less?  Less than 30 years of healthy life in Sierra Leone, and under 35 years in six other African nations!  We see some horrifying statistics on the effects of HIV/AIDS in many of these nations.<br /><br />Food security has many aspects.  The main one addressed here is defence against climate changes.<br /><br />What about water?  The problem here is not so much of not having enough to go around.  It is that arguments about water can escalate into warfare.  This is a good example of where environmental cooperation is important and achievable.<br /><br />As for oil, there are three obvious concerns.  First, if we keep doing what we've been doing, eventually we'll run out.  Second, oil's value as a commodity is undermining efforts for peace in some areas of the world.  Third, burning oil threatens the stability of our climate.  The first suggestion here is demand-side management.  Now, what about burning hydrogen?  That looks like a technologically tricky idea.  We may need to look at other options.  Hybrid cars will help a little, but that still means using gasoline.  I happen to favor an intermediate idea: cutting way back on gasoline and trying to make use of alcohol as a fuel.<br /><br />The next chapter is on disarmament.  That idea has not had a good history.  People simply rearm.  I think the whole topic needs a great deal more thought.<br /><br />The final chapter is on laying the foundations for peace.  Is the United Nations up to this task?  My answer would be a clear no.  This book strongly disagrees, although it does feel that some new ideas are needed.<br /><br />I think the biggest weakness of the book is in addressing terrorism.  The claim is made that terror can not be defeated by military means.  Well, obviously more is needed than occasional use of force.  But if the terrorists win militarily, the game is over.  Unless our civilization can avoid being defeated militarily by terrorists, it may not have a chance at a future.  I think defeating terror requires imposition of an authority that values truth and insists on teaching it to those who would otherwise be educated by terrorists.<br /><br />What does this book say about that?  Just that \\"terrorism is a path chosen by protagonists who tend to be politically desperate and militarily weak.\\"  And that \\"acts of terror are not going to disappear as long as the roots of extremist violence are not tackled.\\"<br /><br />This sort of stuff lowered my rating of this book.  Terrorists are often simply aggressors and bullies whose goals are so unjust and extreme that they know they can not achieve them peacefully.  The roots of extremist violence do need to be tackled.  But they are quite different from what this book implies.<br /><br />I found most of the book interesting, but this one flaw is very serious.ght. <br /> <br />The final chapter is on laying the foundations for peace.

She should be applauded for exposing the problems in Syrian education.<br /><br />We see that Syrians teach their children that Zionism is colonialism and is based on racist fabrications.  Claims are made that it endangers the Arab world.<br /><br />The Arab-Israeli conflict is presented inaccurately in Syrian textbooks.  Far from addressing the 1948 U. S. arms embargo on Israel, it claims that Arabs would have defeated Israel except for the United States!  There are claims that the name of a (mythical) Levantine Arab state was removed from atlases in 1948.  That's really rich, given that the name in those atlases before 1948 was of the British Mandate, and before that of the Ottoman Empire.  But Wurmser shows that these claims are mild compared to many other falsehoods about Zionism in Syrian schoolbooks.<br /><br />The struggle of Syria against Zionism is emphasized.  That's scary, as far as I am concerned.  Zionism is, after all, just the application of the philosophy of universal human rights to everyone, including the Jews.  But to Syria, peace means the obliteration of such rights.<br /><br />As the author points out, \\"Syrian textbooks do not merely fail to educate children for peace, they indoctrinate them with the idea that it is their duty to wage Jihad (Holy War) and become martyrs in the service of the state and its ideology.\\"  And we see that Syrian education is antisemitic as well.  Extermination of the Jews is stated as an obligation in an eleventh-grade textbook.<br /><br />An appendix includes almost 40 pages of examples in Arabic, with the relevant portions translated into English.<br /><br />Clearly, we're not going to have peace in the region unless there is more value placed on truth and less on aggression against one's neighbors.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.	2005-04-12
280719:US	53071109	R35R80N8YY0CBI	185744244X	72820415	The Marshall Attack: Incorporating the Anti-Marshall Lines	Books	5	7	9	N	N	An excellent and relatively up-to-date book on the Marshall	It sure is fun to play the Marshall attack with Black!  You get plenty of shots against the White King.  There are clear chances to win against a strong opponent with Black, since all it takes is one mistake by White.<br /><br />But I play this for White, not for Black.  One reason is that White does not have to let you play the Marshall.  Even after 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 a6, White can simply play the Exchange Variation.  And if White does play 4 Ba4 Nf6 5 0-0 Be7 6 Re1 b5 7 Bb3 0-0 you'll still be as likely as not to wind up in some sort of anti-Marshall.<br /><br />This fine book tells us all where the Marshall stands as of early 2003.<br /><br />First, there is the \\"old main line\\" with 8 c3 d5 9 exd5 Nxd5 10 Nxe5 Nxe5 11 Rxe5 c6 12 d4 Bd6 13 Re1 Qh4 14 g3 Qh3 15 Be3 Bg4 16 Qd3.  Black is trying to get in 16...f5 and then ...f4.  That does not work on move 16!  So the line goes 16...Rae8 17 Nd2 Re6 18 a4 bxa4 (Lalic does not say so explicitly, but 18...f5 19 axb5 looks like it wins for White) 19 Rxa4 f5 20 Qf1 Qh5.  Black has good chances to survive here.<br /><br />Next is the line I play, 15 Re4 g5 16 Qf3, which gives both sides chances, although a draw is a typical result.<br /><br />Chapter three gives a similar idea for White: 12 d3 Bd6 13 Re1 Qh4 14 g3 Qh3 15 Re4.  Now the White rook is defended, so Black can't try 15...g5 any more.  So we get lines like 15...Qf5 16 Nd2 Qg6 17 Re1 f5, after which Black has good chances to live.<br /><br />The next chapter discusses 12 g3 and other options on White's 12th and 13th moves.  Black is okay with proper play.  After that, we examine an important issue: alternatives to 11...c6.  11...Nb4, 11...Nb6, and 11...Nf6 (the original Marshall) do not work.  But 11... Bb7 offers some chances for Black, although I think White is doing rather well after 12 Qf3 Bd6 13 Bxd5.<br /><br />Chapter 6 deals with the unsound Steiner Variation, namely 9...e4.  White is much better after 10 dxc6 exf3 11 d4 fxg2 12 Bg5.  This is a tricky line, and if White wants to allow the Marshall, she has to be prepared for it.<br /><br />Now we get into a variety of anti-Marshalls.  The first is 8 h3, where an interesting possiblity for Black is 8...Bb7 9 d3 d6 10 a3 Na7.  Lalic gives one of his games where he played this for Black.  Next is 8 a4, where Lalic recommends 8...Bb7 9 d3 Re8.  After that, we see 8 d4 Nxd4 9 Nxd4 exd4 10 e5 Ne8 with the idea ...Bb7.  And we see that Black can survive 8 d3 d6 9 c3 Na5 10 Bc2 c5, with the idea of transferring the Kinght from f6 to the Queenside.<br /><br />The final variation is a little surprise from White: 8 c3 d5 9 d4.  Black can get enough counterplay with 9...exd4 10 e5 Ne4.<br /><br />I recommend this book for those interested in playing either side of this exciting defence.This is a tricky line, and if White wants to allow the Marshall, she has to be prepared for it. <br /> <br />Now we get into a variety of anti-Marshalls.

281406:US	53071109	R15YSLTOY8PAGW	1592571794	364292828	The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jerusalem	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Could have been much better	This book has some interesting facts about Jerusalem.  But it does not tell us much about sightseeing in the city.  And it definitely needs some maps.<br /><br />Now, what about the population of Jerusalem?  That is an interesting issue.  I think it is fascinating that when Jerusalem has had a high population, whether it was 2000 years ago or today, the Jews were the majority.  The author could be clearer about the population of the city, by religion, at different times.  He gives us some information, but it isn't all that accurate.<br /><br />I think the historical material is interesting enough so that it makes the book worth reading in spite of what looks like some bias on its part.  The bias is mild when we deal just with facts.  But it exists.  One example is when on page 167, the author tells about the casualties in the Israeli war of independence.  He cites casualties from Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria.  But wait!  He tosses in one more \\"nation!\\"  Were the Levantine Arabs really a nation back then?  Of course not.  Such statements are preposterous antizionist propaganda.  Must be a typo.  But it is in there.  Why?<br /><br />When we get to the UN and efforts to achieve peace, it gets worse.  Now we see Israel as being unwilling to give up territory it acquired in the six-day war.  But it did give up territory, namely the entire Sinai peninsula.  Including Taba.  This book glosses over the fact that UN resolution 242 did not require Israel to give up all the land it acquired (and liberated) at that time.<br /><br />We see an emphasis about Israel, in violation of the UN, trying to change the legal status of Jerusalem.  But we do not see anything about what that status was supposed to be in the first place.  Even internationalization, proposed in 1948, was to end in ten years.  The Jews, being a big majority, would have kept their own capital city.  Why doesn't the author mention this?<br /><br />Still, all these little biases and errors aside, this book is pretty good at reporting quite a few facts.  The biggest problem is that it treats all points of view as equally valid.  After all, you can never satisfy everyone!  I wonder how we would all react to a book about the American South which explained that the Ku Klux Klan wanted to oppress Blacks and that Blacks did not want to be oppressed, and treated the two sides as having equally valid views.pretty good at reporting quite a few facts.

Judith Miller, a reporter, spent quite a while interviewing plenty of people and has written a book which tells about what she heard.  Its style is anecdotal, of course.  It shows plenty about the region and its people, warts and all.<br /><br />Now, what about the reviews of this book?  David Pryce-Jones feels that Miller seriously misinterprets the rationale of Islamists.  That may well be true.  But I think that Miller is free to judge the Islamists by her own standards.  It might be better for us readers were she to tell us more.  But she didn't, and I think we ought to read David Pryce-Jones' book, \\"The Closed Circle,\\" as well as Miller's.<br /><br />More striking is the amazing attack on Miller by Ed Said.  Without this, I might not have read her book at all.  First, Said, a notorious thug, grouped Miller with a surprisingly diverse set of scholars, namely Samuel Huntington, Martin Kramer, Bernard Lewis, Daniel Pipes, Steven Emerson, and Barry Rubin.  I wonder if Said confused these people with the \\"Magnificent Seven\\" and was worried that they would ride into town and gun him down.  It seemed that way when he complained (in 1996) that these seven all make it look as though there is a \\"threat\\" from militant Islam.  Said went on to say that this book is a weapon \\"in the conflict to subordinate, beat down, compel, and defeat any Arab or Muslim resistance to U. S. - Israeli dominance.\\"<br /><br />Um, this book?  Said had to be kidding.  If there was ever projection, this was it, given that so many of Said's books really were weapons in Said's war against human rights, justice, and truth.  Said went on to question Miller's qualifications to write such a book.  He wisely did not challenge his own qualifications to write anything on this subject.<br /><br />In any case, this book is worth reading.	2005-04-11

This is one of them.  And yes, it tries to find some common ground between Pagans and Christians.  It also looks at differences between them.<br /><br />diZerega begins by stating that while Pagans are quite varied in their approaches to religion, there are five characteristics that are typically associated with Paganism, namely Pantheism (or Panentheism), Animism, Polytheism, cyclical as opposed to linear reality, and the lack of an Ultimate Evil.<br /><br />That's an interesting claim.  It may well be true.<br /><br />Unlike the author, I'm not too interested in whether there is an underlying unity to divinity.  I think we've seen far too much of that way of \\"thinking\\" from the \\"monotheists.\\"  If by unity, we mean reality and perfection, that's fine.  But the whole point of Polytheism, to my way of thinking, is that the Goddesses and Gods are perfections of attributes.  That is the most they can be.  The Christian god is far less than that, in my opinion, because by being defined to be bad at nothing, it can not be good at anything either.<br /><br />diZerega does not mention the difference between a \\"first cause\\" monotheist god and the very different Polytheist Gods and Goddesses.  Once again, by making their god the first cause, I think the monotheists rendered it far less than any real Goddess or God.  A first cause needs to be infinitely weak, otherwise something even weaker would have had to create it.<br /><br />The author mentions that some Jews and Muslims think Christianity is basically Polytheistic.  That's because the Trinity seems like three deities.  One could also argue that the Saints are actually an entire Pantheon.  I don't buy either of these arguments.  Instead, I dismiss Judaism, Islam, and Christianity as atheism.  My flippant reason is that their adherents believe in so few gods that they are basically no different than atheists, but I think you can see my real reasoning in the preceding paragraphs.<br /><br />Now, what about idol worship?  Here, the author makes the excellent point that Pagans do not think that idols are actual deities.  Instead, many of us focus on the idols and on ourselves.  Actually many Christians do the same with statues of their heroes.<br /><br />I think the distinction between cyclic and linear views of reality is valid.  Authors such as Walter Kaufmann have stated that Judaism in particular emphasizes the uniqueness of reality.  There is one universe, it was created, and it moves linearly through time.  Things happen once, and that is it.  Most Pagans tend towards a very different view, one where the universe always exists, and recurring phenomena, including rebirth become significant.<br /><br />diZerega now makes a major point with which I strongly agree.  He says that three major aspects of Paganism that makes it different from Christianity are:<br /><br />1)  Religious pluralism<br /><br />2)  Harmony rather than salvation as the primary religious focus<br /><br />3)  Greater respect for personal experience than faith or the experiences of others as a valid criterion for spiritual truth<br /><br />I think he got that right!  This may explain why many Pagans feel offended when authoritarian monotheists try to dictate how we ought to worship, or cite religious authorities as experts on spirituality, or preach intolerance of those who have \\"incorrect\\" religious views.  He contrasts this with the intolerance of Christians for Christians of different sects, even before the Christians took over the Roman Empire.  And he gives some evidence that this intolerance was what got the Christians in trouble with the relatively tolerant Romans.<br /><br />The book has a brief but sincere description of Wicca.  And then we get into Christian complaints about Wicca and Wiccan complaints about Christianity.<br /><br />The Christian criticisms of Wicca fall into a three categories: Wicca does notaddress the problem of suffering and Evil, Wicca does not deal with the problem of malice, and Wicca not only denies the Bible but has no sacred scriptures to substitute for it.  While I think these criticisms are probably invalid, I see no reason why Wicca needs to (or ought to) deal with suffering, malice, or evil, or have any sacred scriptures for that matter. diZerega spends a while attacking the Bible as inaccurate and self-inconsistent.<br /><br />The Wiccan criticisms of Christianity start with Christianity's blindness to spirit and nature: Christians rarely sympathize with considering the material world sacred.  The other criticism is, of course, Christianity's intolerance of multiple Deities.<br /><br />I think this latter criticism is very serious.  Humans are varied, live in all sorts of different locations, and are fickle.  For all three reasons, we need a big Pantheon.  Making Them into just one deity not only gets rid of Them all, it also gives tyrants an excuse to say that the only remaining deity rules the whole world and everyone in it, giving these tyrants an excuse to impose religious tyranny on their own people, their neighbors, and everyone else.<br /><br />This is an interesting and thought-provoking book.ca not only denies the Bible but has no sacred scriptures to substitute for it.

All sorts of results from polls that tell us what Jews and Arabs think.  Distributed by where they live, age group, and all kinds of other factors.  I didn't check to see how good the polling was, but for the sake of argument, let's say that it may be reasonable.  The reason I won't simply accept it out of hand is that it comes up with a few results that seem unusual.  But that is not my problem with the book.<br /><br />My problem is with the interpretation of the results.  We see all sorts of stuff about how strongly Arabs and Jews feel about Jeruasalem, the Temple Mount, the Western Wall, the Jewish neighborhoods in Jerusalem, having Jerusalem as a capital, and all sorts of other topics.  As well as what folks on each side think of the chances (at about the time of Camp David) for peace.<br /><br />But strength of feelings is no determiner of truth or justice.<br /><br />If Paris were a French city, both in terms of truth and justice, Germans might well feel much more strongly about it than French.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I think if we were to try to measure which side of an argument about facts were true, I suspect that there might well tend to be a anticorrelation between strength of feelings and truth.  Why lie if you don't care about it?  Similarly, I think many Jews might reason that Jerusalem is their capital; if it gets stolen, they'll just get a new one.  Arabs might well feel the same way about Mecca (which is, of course, a religious capital, not a secular one).  On the other hand, Jerusalem may be more important to Arabs than it is to Jews.  Unless Arabs can swipe Jerusalem, they'll never be able to swipe the Jewish capital!  There isn't any alternative location!  You can't humiliate someone by pretending to swipe their capital.  You need to do it for real.<br /><br />So I would expect Jerusalem to be more important to the Arabs than to the Jews if indeed everyone realizes that it is the Jewish capital.  But only if plenty of Arabs feel a need to reduce or eliminate Jewish rights.<br /><br />Now, some of the polls show that 39% of the Jews \\"realize\\" that Arabs may have legitimate rights in Jerusalem, while 20% of Arabs \\"realize\\" that Jews may have legitmate rights in Jerusalem.  Um, I wonder just what rights those might be?  Rights to exclude others?  Rights to determine the national language there?  I think this topic is a little bit vague.<br /><br />Had the book stopped after giving all the facts, I would have given it three or four stars.  But it went to the trouble of trying to draw conclusions about peace.  As we now know, 2000 was a deceptive year, in which many of us thought that peace might be forthcoming.  Well, this book made good use of its chance to draw some conclusions which soon became dubious.<br /><br />It showed that both sides would have plenty of popular support if they refused to compromise on Jerusalem.  But it made no serious effort to address what a good solution would be if everyone agreed to it!  If 100 engineers agree that a bad design for a bridge is fine, that bridge will still collapse!  Why try to agree on something which is doomed to fail?<br /><br />Instead, the book said that the best chance for peace appeared to be to try to increase the number of Jews who thought that compromise on Jerusalem would lead to peace.  Now, let's think about that.  Does that mean putting pressure on Israelis to say that ceding land to an aggressor will lead to peace?  And if it does, will that truly lead to peace, or just increase the chances that both sides will move towards war?<br /><br />The book explains that 88% of Israeli Jews felt that appeasement of Arab demands on Jerusalem would simply lead to open-ended Arab demands in the future.  I think the proper conclusion is not to pressure Israel into making such concessions anyway, or into changing their minds about such concessions being counterproductive.  I think some people think the right answer is tomake sure that concessions are final, not open-ended.  But saying that they are final is just words.  I think the authors all ought to have asked themselves if the 88% were right, not how they could change the minds of the 88%.<br /><br />My conclusions would have been the following:<br /><br />1)  Insist on truth, not agreement on lies, as a prerequisite to peace.<br /><br />2)  If concessions need to be made, let them be ones that are productive, not destructive.  The side that receives something must actually value it more than the side that gives it up.<br /><br />3)  Since concessions will have real value, make sure all of them are paid for.  Pay for land with money or land.  Accept money for land only if it is from the actual future owners and is more than you yourself would be willing to pay for it.<br /><br />4)  Actually enforce agreements.  If either side feels that the agreements will not be enforced (or worse, are not desired by any of the parties), the agreements will accomplish nothing.make sure that concessions are final, not open-ended.

Yes, what ought we do now?<br /><br />First, let me say that with all due respect for Greg Palast and his fine article, no, Kerry did not win the 2004 election.  Let me explain what I mean by this.  Under the laws of the land, Bush won.  If Bush had received every vote Kerry got and Kerry had received every vote Bush got, Kerry would actually have won.  Bush really won the election.  But a big reason why Bush won the election is that the election itself was unfair.  With the spoilage and provisional ballots, Democratic votes were tossed out, legally, in large numbers, much more so than Republican votes.  Yes, we lost, quite legally.  But we need to change some of the laws here, and get back to every citizen having a right to vote and to get their vote counted!<br /><br />In contrast, Gore did win the 2000 election.  Under the laws of the land, Gore got more popular and electoral votes.  Had Bush received every vote Gore got and Gore received every vote Bush got, Bush would have won easily.  Bush became President because the rules were changed after the results were known, so that the loser would become President.  That did not happen in 2004.<br /><br />Now, what ought we do?  This book has some good ideas.<br /><br />As the book says, many of us voted against the person who had stolen the 2000 election.  So one priority has to be election reform.  Greg Palast recommends giving Black voters real ballots and counting them, not provisional ballots and not counting them.  A good idea!  Howard Dean has a superb suggestion: instant runoff voting.  I know some of you out there do not agree with him (or me) on this.  But he's right.  Donna Brazille wants us to make voting machines more secure, as secure as ATMs or slot-machines!  Another excellent idea.  We need to campaign for all these ideas.<br /><br />Now, what about our campaigns?  That's a subject for debate.  But Steve Almond has an idea that I like very much: tell the truth.  Yes.  Tell the truth, as bluntly as possible.  I like truth, and I also like the fact that the electorate may eventually like it as well, if it ever gets a good taste of it.  Almond reminds us that the media are not interested in truth.  They view the election as a \\"reality TV drama,\\" not a political event.  Telling the truth includes attacking the media when it covers up failed policy.  Fixing the media system has to be a major goal.<br /><br />By the way, there are plenty of women in this country.  But in 2001, when ABC, CBS, and NBC interviewed people on their nightly news broadcasts, 85% of those they interviewed were males.  Meanwhile, Bush defunded Planned Parenthood.  And Roe vs Wade could be in jeopardy now.  We're going to have to address these issues, in or out of a Presidential campaign.<br /><br />Is the United States a Christian country?  Robin Morgan points out the views of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jerfferson, and James Madison.  Our founders did not create a Christian nation, but a secular one.  And the 1796 Treaty of Tripoli, initiated by George Washington and signed into law by John Adams, says \\"The government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.\\"<br /><br />There's plenty more advice in this book, on all sorts of topics.  But here are two more ideas from this book.  Reduce our dependence on foreign oil!  And build schools, plenty of them, in Muslim countries and staff them with our teachers, so the kids there will have alternatives to fundamentalist madrasas for their educations.s bluntly as possible.

It tells us plenty about what happened in Rwanda in 1994, a year in which ten percent of the nation's population died, including most of the minority Tutsi population.  Most were slaughtered by the majority Hutus, with machetes.<br /><br />This book has an appendix that includes the entire screenplay of the movie.  And it has a very interesting transcript of a PBS show about the genocide called \\"The Triumph of Evil.\\"  In addition, it discusses the making of the movie.<br /><br />I've never been in Rwanda, so let me say what questions I had that I hoped this book (and the movie) might shed some light on:<br /><br />1)  Fear.  I think the movie is excellent at showing the constant fear on the part of the Tutsis.  But what about the killers?  Were they scared?  I couldn't tell.  It was awfully difficult for me to comprehend what would make people go out and massacre their neighbors with machetes.<br /><br />2)  Betrayal.  The movie does explain that it would have taken relatively little effort for outside troops to stop the slaughter.  And it shows some of the politics that appear to have prevented this.  But betrayal was not only by the United Nations, France, and a variety of other Western nations.  There was also betrayal by the Catholic church, given that most of the killers and most of the victims were Catholics.  We don't see much of that.  But the book tells us that many Tutsis tried to seek refuge in the churches only to be killed in them.<br /><br />3)  Ugliness.  I was curious about appearances in such times.  Some folks say that people who are perceived to be ugly, grubby, impoverished, or disheveled are easier to see as dehumanized, putting them at greater risk in slaughters.  And we see a hint of this in the movie, when Paul Rusesabagina says \\"this is not a refugee camp.  The Interahamwe believe that the Mille Collines is a four star Sabena hotel.  That is the only thing that is keeping us alive.\\"<br /><br />I agree that the question of just which people were allowed into the Mille Collines is interesting.  It was a matter of life and death for most of them.  But I don't think this is critical to the story.<br /><br />One last point.  The book makes it clear that one of the biggest differences between the movie and real life is the blood.  Considering that hundreds of thousands of people were killed with machetes, I can believe that.  And I'm glad that the movie left out some of the realism here.<br /><br />I know that many people will be suspicious of a book and movie about such a political issue.  But this movie and book got me to look more deeply into the history of what did happen in Rwanda.  I think it is worth recommending on that basis alone.I agree that the question of just which people were allowed into the Mille Collines is interesting.

This is a fine book about an important topic in acoustics.  If the field of acoustics is like a bunch of fine wines, this is the champagne!<br /><br />Acoustic bubbles have many manifestations.  These include clinical ultrasound as well as ocean acoustics.  It is worthwhile for someone who wishes to be an expert on one of these topics to become familiar with some other applications the study of acoustic bubbles.<br /><br />The first chapter covers the fundamentals of waves, sound, and wavefronts.  Of course, special attention is placed on sound in solid and liquid media.  And we also learn about the generation of ultrasound, simulated sound fields, and nonlinear effects in underwater ultrasound beams.<br /><br />The second chapter teaches us about bubbles.  We learn about the tensile strength of liquids, so we'll know what it takes to make them cavitate.  And we learn about Rayleigh collapse, so we'll know what it takes to produce decavitation.  Next, we review (I hope it is a review!) fluid dynamics, and look at the problem of a rigid sphere moving through a liquid.<br /><br />In the third chapter, we get to a powerful analogy to a bubble in a liquid, namely a bob of a specified mass attached to a spring.  After a quick review of unforced oscillators, we get to the Minnaert frequency (the natural frequency of a spherical gas bubble in a liquid for low-amplitude simple harmonic motion).  It's interesting to see if we can thus approximate the sounds of brooks, waterfalls, rainfall, or the ocean.<br /><br />The next chapter gets us to a discussion of the interaction between a bubble and the sound wave that can drive it into oscillation.  We still use the analogy of the bob on a spring, but now we're dealing with a driven oscillator (the author assures us that this is a better approximation that trying to predict the outcome of a horse race by assuming a spherically symmetrical horse).  We learn about acoustic emissions from these bubbles, chaotic oscillations of bubbles, and so forth.  We're still basically dealing with individual bubbles, of course.<br /><br />The final chapter deals with the real behavior of acoustic bubble systems.  That includes topics such as detection of bubbles, bubble motion and stabilization, and use of bubbles in ultrasonic surgery.  And, of course, sonoluminescence, for which there is a discussion of mechanisms as well as what is now a particularly, um, hot topic, temperatures of imploding bubbles.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book.  I'll never listen to champagne the same way again.ally dealing with individual bubbles, of course.    The final chapter deals with the real behavior of acoustic bubble systems.

Why are they in Charlotte, Dearborn, New York City, Newark, Boston, Chicago, Louisville, Houston, Atlanta, Tampa, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Portland?  And why are they engaged in criminal activities there?<br /><br />This book explains some of the answers about who they are, how they get here, and what many of them do once they are here.  And it explains, suspense and all, how a cell of terrorists in Charlotte was rounded up.<br /><br />The moral of this tale is simple.  We could have stopped the 9/11 terrorists a couple of times, had we simply allowed our intelligence people and crime investigators to cooperate.  We will need to be prepared for more terror.  And unless we do something to prevent it, one day there will be an even bigger disaster.<br /><br />We are vulnerable to attacks on our food, water, power, and transportation.  \\"The biggest threat to our civil liberties is our continuing inability to deal with the threat [of terrorism] in a reasonable time.\\"  Obviously, if several hundred thousand Americans were to die in one or more terrorist attacks, both that and our response to it would reduce our liberties severely.<br /><br />Here are the concluding recommendations, some of which may seem a little repetitive, of this rather exciting and thought-provoking book:<br /><br />*  Realize that a determined army of radical Islamists long ago declared war on America<br /><br />*  Realize that Hezbollah is in the front rank of this army<br /><br />*  Avoid making scapegoats of our law enforcement and intelligence agenicies as institutions<br /><br />*  Put handcuffs on the terrorists, not the law enforcement agencies<br /><br />*  Understand as a nation that the goals of those agents who hunt terrorists is not to harm the innocent but to catch and convict the guilty<br /><br />*  Do a better job of controlling our borders<br /><br />*  Come up with a consistent national form of secure identification<br /><br />*  Study the \\"trip wires\\" of organized terrorism so that we will know when they are being triggered<br /><br />*  Integrate our vulnerability to terror into our national thinking<br /><br />*  Honor those in law enforcement and counterterrorism who combat the terrorists<br /><br />I'm not sure exactly what we ought to do.

He starts out by mentioning that about half of the Jews in the world live in Israel, while less than a percent of all Arabs live in the Levant.  And there is a fundamental truth that might have resulted in peace had just a few \\"honest brokers\\" of a peace agreement admitted to it.  Please repeat after me:<br /><br />\\"If the Arabs and Muslims would lay down their arms, there will be no more violence.  If Israel does so, there will be no more Israel.\\"<br /><br />Please repeat it one more time.  Thank you!<br /><br />Another essay shows that there is nothing in common between historic colonialism or even \\"neocolonialism\\" and the resettlement of the Land of Israel by Jews.<br /><br />We also see that a demand to remove all Jews from a new Levantine Arab state implies, by reciprocity, that all Arabs ought to be removed from Israel.  The author shows that such ethnic cleansing is simply a bad idea.<br /><br />Then there is a topic that is totally politically incorrect, namely the truth about Sabra and Shatilla and the roles of Elie Hubeika and the Syrians.<br /><br />There is a good article comparing the Levantine Jews to the Native North Americans.  Both are the only surviving native nations of their ancient homelands.  But I think the author could have mentioned that in times of high population in the Levant, the Jews have been a majority.  That's no small point, as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />Yes, it is true that some Levantine Arabs are miserable.  Anbar reminds us that so were some Germans in 1945.<br /><br />There is a superb essay on non-negotiable points, just in case Israel wants to talk peace with the terrorists.  First, there must be no negotiations under fire.  Such adventures are simply acts of surrender.  If one wishes to negotiate, there must be an effective cease-fire first.<br /><br />Anbar proposes some very reasonable preconditions.  Any civilized society that is at all interested in peace will accept them.  If they are rejected, negotiations weren't going to get anywhere useful anyway.  Here they are:<br /><br />* Acknowledge history<br /><br />* Recognize Zionism<br /><br />* Accept that Jerusalem will remain exclusively the capital of the Jewish State<br /><br />* Give Jews the right to live as full citizens in territories under Arab rule and vice-versa<br /><br />* Recognize and respect each other's boundaries<br /><br />* Extradite all citizens guilty of crimes in territories of the other<br /><br />* Protect and respect all sites of religious or historical significance under one's jurisdiction<br /><br />These are all well worth considering.<br /><br />Now, what punishment is appropriate for aggression?  Anbar says that penalties ought to be assessed in kind.  Israel has nothing to gain by making Arabs miserable.  The proper penalty for Arab aggression ought to be political, namely permanent loss of what is now Arab territory.<br /><br />There is an essay on revisionist historians, such as the Soviets, who kept changing history with each new edition of their encyclopedias.  One example is Karen Armstrong, who simply purged Islam's violent past from her history of it.  And there is a good essay about the UN, a global sheriff that we need to fire.<br /><br />Now what about the historical myths of Arafat's gang?  Anbar mentions some of them.  These include the taunt that there never was a Jewish Temple and that Jesus was an Arab, not a Jew.  This latter statement was endorsed by a Christian, namely Hanan Ashrawi.  By the way, I have an especially dim view of negotiating with people who say such things.  If they are going to bray nonsense on such simple issues, why ought we think there is anything to agreements they may sign?<br /><br />For those of us who have not read Suras 19 or 62 of the Koran, it may be a surprise to learn that Miriam, the elder sister of Moses, lived to be the mother of Jesus, well over 1000 years later.  Thatis a long time to be a virgin!<br /><br />In another essay, we learn that \\"Jews are a relatively easy preliminary target of Islamist violence.\\"  Yes, violence is a threat.  But the \\"demographic bomb\\" scare is less dangerous, and Anbar shows us why.<br /><br />What about a constitution for the State of Israel?  Yes, Israel ought to have one.  And Anbar recommends that it include stating that the Land of Israel is the ancient homeland of the Jewish people, the Zionist flag and anthem are Israel's flag and anthem, and that Hebrew is the official language.  To put it mildly, these are reasonable ideas that any other nation would grant itself without debate.

And Anbar recommends that it include stating that the Land of Israel is the ancient homeland of the Jewish people, the Zionist flag and anthem are Israel's flag and anthem, and that Hebrew is the official language.

In general, this means attacks on human rights for Jews from Muslims and Arabs (often calling it \\"antizionism\\").  These attacks are often from the political Left.  That is not exactly new.  The political Left has attacked Jews before.  Even if one wishes to ignore Vichy France, one can look at the record of the Soviet Union and its supporters in the last few years before 1967.<br /><br />This book has plenty of anecdotes about antisemitism in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  But the significant part is what people with some responsibility do, as part of their jobs.  That includes leaders of groups that supposedly support human rights.  It includes some major elements of the media.  And it includes some members of Congress.<br /><br />The book shows that the nationally syndicated Evans and Novak column, the Christian Science Monitor, and Time Magazine all had some serious problems in this respect.  Here is Time Magazine in March, 1970:<br /><br />\\"The vehemence of the American Jewish community's support for Israel creates an impression in the minds of some that Washington is acting not on the basis of national interest but out of fear of Jewish wrath.  When public officials such as John Lindsay and Nelson Rockefeller abdicate their ceremonial responsibilities toward a foreign leader, it is a sign that pressure-bloc politics is taking precedence over common sense and public duty.\\"<br /><br />Strong words!  Time Magazine is free to say what it pleases, of course.  But if I were to come up with something like this, I'd expect and deserve to be called an antisemite.<br /><br />There's plenty more about which groups were doing what back then.  I think it is worthwhile looking at books from thirty and fifty years ago, especially to see how much of this era is denied by \\"revisionist\\" historians.	2005-04-04
290521:US	53071109	R3I7EHUTDBILF9	0802141935	918527495	The Neocon Reader	Books	5	35	46	N	N	An informative book	I'm not a conservative.  I'm neither paleoconservative nor neoconservative.  I'm a liberal.<br /><br />Still, this book tells us who the neoconservatives are and gives us a fair sampling of what they say, and what others say about them.<br /><br />Basically, neoconservatives are former liberals.  Most started as Democratic hawks.  Some of them were startled by the anti-war Democrats in the 1960s and 1970s, and felt that the anti-war movement went beyond constructive criticism and rejected traditional American attitudes, values, and goals.  Others, including many \\"Scoop Jackson\\" Democrats, were liberals who wanted to avoid appeasing Soviet tyranny.  And some were liberals who were shocked by the treatment of liberal values at the United Nations.<br /><br />Obviously, none of these people had to leave the Democratic Party to maintain their liberal views.  But most did.  And I was curious to see what views they wound up with.<br /><br />One article is about foot patrols by policemen.  But this strikes me as an issue anyone might take either side of, liberal or conservative.  Another article discusses pornography and censorship.  Well, that certainly might get a different reaction from liberals than from conservatives.  Still, both sides surely would draw a line somewhere as to what constitutes obscenity.  The only question is where.<br /><br />There is a fascinating article on the deficit.  It is pointed out that the deficit only includes money that the government has borrowed and chosen to pay interest on.  Social security, which swamps the deficit in size, doesn't count.  Neither do America's assets.  Even the interest rate is not factored into the size of the deficit in many comparisons.  Good points.  But what does that have to do with being a liberal or a conservative?<br /><br />There are a couple of articles telling about the history of Britain in its fight against Napoleon, and against Vichy France, and against the Soviets, and even in Kosovo.  That is more like it.  And while much of this is simply historical, it is clear that George Bush senior and James Baker were anti-interventionist in the former Yugoslavia (clumsily so, if you ask me), while the neocons are interventionists.<br /><br />Well, there is one more issue.  Many neocons are Jews.  And that leads to why I started reading this book in the first place.  A friend of mine told me that the neocons got us into the war with Iraq.  And said that \\"some folks are willing to hurt the United States if they can thereby help Israel.\\"<br /><br />Annoyed, I came up with a, um, jilllike reply:<br /><br />\\"I'm willing to help Israel if I can thereby help the United States.  Unlike some on the Right who are willing to hurt the United States if they can thereby hurt Israel.  And some on the Left who are willing to hurt Israel if they can thereby hurt the United States.\\"<br /><br />Of course, all these statements go a little too far.  We all know that relatively few Americans want to hurt the United States.<br /><br />Still, we do see some folks imply that the neocons are simply Jews who are more loyal to Israel than to the United States, and who have taken over American foreign policy to boot.  That is not accurate, just malicious.  Joshua Muravchik's article in this book exposes this for the untruth that it is, and also shows how some in the media (especially the BBC) have tried to propagate this untruth.<br /><br />Actually, I think the full untruth is that Israel is responsible for causing all Arab hatred of the West, that the war in Iraq is being fought for Israel's sake, and that the ungrateful Israelis don't even help us or thank us.  And this seems rather like the claim that the reason some folks opposed the German National Socialists in 1938 was that a Czech conspiracy existed which opposed Germany and had conned many in the West into supporting it rather than doing what was right.<br /><br />For those who want a little reality and truth about who the neocons are and what they say, I recommend this book.	2005-04-04

After all, he was a Christian.  The answer is that the majority of his fellow terrorists in Arafat's gang were Muslims.<br /><br />Said took sides in the Arab war against Jewish rights.  In this war, there are two basic sides.<br /><br />The Arab argument, rarely stated in English, is simple.  There are vastly more Arabs than Jews.  Sooner or later, Arabs will be in the same league as the Jews militarily.  Twice as good per person, half as good per person, it doesn't matter.  Sooner or later, the rest of the world will stand by idly and let the Arabs defeat the Jews.  The Arabs, being more numerous, are going to kick the Jews out of most of Asia, most of Africa, and maybe Europe too.  That is what happens to small minorities that are disliked.  It's silly to oppose any of this.  After all, the Arabs may benefit somewhat by the presence of Jews, but they'd rather just start a war to get rid of them.  And that is what counts.<br /><br />The Jewish argument is simple too.  Yes, there are more Arabs than Jews.  But the Jews are almost impossible to defeat in peacetime.  Only a war can really get rid of the Jews.  And in a world that insists on human rights to life, liberty, and property, all sorts of people have a chance to survive and contribute to the prosperity of their societies.  Sooner or later, people will allow minorities to survive, just because it helps everyone to do that.  It's silly to oppose any of this.  A few minorities may get hurt badly if enough people gang up against them.  But in the long run, that won't help anyone, and eventually, minorities will be allowed to have rights and aggressors will get spanked.<br /><br />Said picked the Arab side here.  And this is one of many books he wrote as a weapon in his war against human rights.<br /><br />We certainly ought to be honest when we cover Islam in the media.  But that means we should avoid any advice given to us by a dishonest thug like Said.  Instead, we ought to discover the basics about Islam and its role in the world without his \\"help.\\"<br /><br />Said wanted the Muslim extremists to win, so, especially since he was writing before 2001, he tried to tell people not to fight Islamic extremism.  That is why in this book, he took great pains to attack and defame people such as Martin Peretz, Bernard Lewis, David Pryce-Jones, Charles Krauthammer, and Judith Miller.  What bothered him about them certainly was not any of their mistakes.  It was their honesty and accuracy.<br /><br />In this book, Said used a sentence of over 100 words to mention Ziad Abu Ain.  Now, I know that Said was a thug.  But he did go to college and I think he even took more than one class in English in college!  He ought to have known that such a sentence is too long.  Let's look at part of that sentence.  Said said that Abu Ain was just a poor Arab youth who \\"was undergoing the prolonged agony of extradition proceedings (plus the denial of bail and of a habeas corpus writ) with the active collaboration of the State Department, just because (and only because) the Israeli government had claimed - with a third-party confession extracted from and later retracted\\" by another Arab \\"in an Israeli jail in Hebrew, a language he did not know - that he was a terrorist, responsible for a bomb incident two years before.\\"<br /><br />Two years!  That is a long time.  Maybe we ought to forget it, or at least forgive.  No, let's make this \\"youth\\" a hero!  By the way, why ought we assume that Israeli justice is unfair?  Said implied here that Jews will do anything to hurt an innocent Arab.  But that's manifest nonsense.  If Jewish authorities really were like that, most Jews would convert to other religions in minutes, to avoid having anything to do with such a suicidally demonic people.  And the rest wouldn't last a week.<br /><br />Now, what did Abu Ain really do?  On May 14, 1979, he put a time-bomb in a public trash basket next to a bus stop.  The bomb was timed to go off when many children would be there, near the start of Lag b'Omer celebrations.  Two boys were killed, and 36 people were maimed and wounded, including an American citizen.  Abu Ain fled the country, and an accomplice told authorities what happened, and confessed.  The accomplice retracted the confession, but there was easily enough evidence for an extradition.  Abu Ain's lawyers fought extradition, claiming that what Ain did was a political act, not a criminal one.  Besides, they said that for Abu Ain to be held by the Israelis would be cruel and unusual!  You may want to read about this in some other book!<br /><br />Would you have guessed any of this from what Said wrote?<br /><br />Just avoid this book.re, near the start of Lag b'Omer celebrations.

This isn't it.<br /><br />Oh, and I've been told that the author is an atheist.  Well, that makes little difference to me.  From my perspective, atheists are a majority in the world (I count monotheists as atheists, given that they believe in such a small number of Gods and Goddesses).  I've also been told that the author is in favor of human rights.  After reading this book, I have my doubts about that.<br /><br />I'd love to see some useful information about places I wish I knew more about, such as Pakistan.  But I didn't get anything I could trust from this book, nor even guidance from it on how to find trustworthy material.<br /><br />The topic I do know something about is Israel, and on this topic, Ali is way off.  So far off that I couldn't trust anything he said after reading the many things he said about it.  Oh, Ali does admit that Israel did indeed fight in 1967, and that its survival caused it problems.  That makes sense; if it hadn't survived, it would have had fewer problems!  Yes, many Jews were genuinely and rightfully worried in 1967.  According to Ali, they were afraid that Arab revenge on them would be brutal.  Um, is that anything like the worry many Jews felt in central Europe in the early 1940s?  Were these Jews rightfully worried that German revenge on them would be brutal?  After all, several million Jews did get murdered at that time.  But I almost forgot!  Revenge for what?<br /><br />Since Ali didn't tell you what crime the Jews committed, I will.  They became emancipated.  That was the crime that needed avenging!  Now you can see why I am suspicious of Ali's commitment to human rights.<br /><br />Anyway, I read books to be informed, not misinformed.<br /><br />Still, suppose you want to read something witty, imaginative, and both politically and factually incorrect.  Something anti-monotheistic and anti-Israeli.  Something that hits the neocons below the belt.

Reflections on Justice and Nationhood	Books	1	8	53	N	N	Absurd	Noam Chomsky has been a pioneer in the field of linguistics. He helped restore a rationalistic approach to the subject.  Chomsky came up with the concept of context-free grammars, and developed many of their properties. He has backed the idea that language acquisition in humans is largely innate, and the evidence for this idea seems to be increasing. He's a very bright person who has made many genuine scholarly contributions to society.<br /><br />Even Chomsky's approach to social issues has had some positive aspects. While many people have addressed national policy issues principally in pragmatic terms, Chomsky has emphasized moral issues. He has wisely advised us to avoid resolving debates on moral issues purely on pragmatic grounds. And he has advised us to be wary of the role of the media in obtaining popular consent for dubious policies.<br /><br />But this book is useless trash.<br /><br />Sure, there are plenty of details about what Chomsky thinks of Arab-Israeli peace, and sure, I disagree with plenty of what he says, but the main problem is the lack of any credible basis for evaluating where we stand.  Before we can even consider solutions to the Arab war against Jewish rights in the region, we need to apply some facts and logic.  This is something Chomsky could have done extremely well, but he chose not to do that.<br /><br />Chomsky says in this book that both sides can make a persuasive case.  Well, I suppose one could claim that both the Blacks and the Ku Klux Klan can make a persuasive case.  But those of us who support human rights are not going to be persuaded by the claims of the Ku Klux Klan or by Arab racists into oppressing Southern Blacks or Middle Eastern Jews.<br /><br />Now, here are some facts and logic that Chomsky appears to have chosen not to consider:<br /><br />Humans who have an interest in buying land and the means to do so will often buy land and improve it.  Land that is for sale often goes to the high bidders.  The high bidders tend to have the biggest interest in making good use of that land.  Jews are humans.  Jews wanted land in the Levant and were willing to pay very high prices for it.  And they bought land for those prices.<br /><br />Human rights include property rights.  If racists are going to be allowed to steal land from Blacks, Jews, or other minorities, that will violate property rights for everyone.<br /><br />Israel became a nation because Great Britain came up with the White Paper of 1939, which kept large numbers of Jews from moving to the Levant.  This cost most of these Jews their lives and convinced almost all of the survivors that the only way to support human rights in the Levant was to have an independent state there that would allow Jews to have rights.  Since Jews are humans, repudiation of Jewish rights is a repudiation of human rights.  Needless to say, human rights do not preclude Arab rights.  Quite the contrary.  Arabs are humans and repudiation of Arab rights would repudiate human rights.<br /><br />Israel is land-poor.  That is a fairly well-defined concept.  Namely, if everyone in the world actually owned the land they lived on but had to put it up for sale to the highest bidder (which in many cases would be themselves, since they would be paying themselves for the land), in peacetime, Jews would buy up more of the Levant than they have now.  Unless violence is employed to do something about Israelis, they'll wind up with a little more land, not a little less land.  There are five million Jews in Israel now, and in peacetime, even more Jews might want to move there.  And the amount of territory five million people in that region tend to be sovereign in is well over 11,000 square miles.<br /><br />That is what truth, justice, facts, logic, and human rights tell us.<br /><br />It is true that many Jews lost land in the past century.  So did some Arabs.  I could argue that the Jews tended to lose it in wars of aggression against them, while the Arabs tended to lose it in wars of aggression by them.  But, I think that is irrelevant.  Most of the victims are long dead now, and I think it is time to close that chapter.  However, it is preposterous and counterproductive to indict only the victims of such crimes, and reward the villains.  And I think we ought to find something better to do than that.of the victims are long dead now, and I think it is time to close that chapter.

But I do not mind at all that the author disagrees with him on some issues.  I am politically liberal, a Pagan, and a Zionist.  Still, I did not get angry when I read this book, even though I disagreed with the author on many issues.  Amal Saad-Ghorayeb really does examine Hizbu'llah, a Lebanese terrorist organization.  And as far as I can tell, she tries very hard to be politically neutral.  Unfortunately, she could have done better in that respect.<br /><br />Saad-Ghorayeb does not shy away from obvious questions about Hizbu'llah.  She does mention statements which do \\"leave the indelible impression that martyrdom\\" is valued \\"as an end in itself.\\"  She discusses Hizbu'llah's fight against the West.  And its anti-Zionism and anti-Judaism.<br /><br />Now, is this a good scholarly work?  It's not all that bad.  And it is fascinating.  But it could be improved.  The first problem is that there is a difference between truth and falsehood.  On issues such as Holocaust denial, it would be worth pointing that out.  The author could also have explained which side is telling the truth, rather than merely citing opposing claims.  And she could even have tried to discuss why one side would indulge in fiction here.<br /><br />There many are other topics on which I think the author is simply wrong.  She discusses Zionist domination of American films.  Obviously, there have been some movies, such as \\"Exodus,\\" which present an ardently Zionist perspective.  But I think she could have simply dropped this topic from her book.  That's what I would have done with a topic if I knew as little about it as she does about this one.  And she could have presented a discussion of Israel that included arguments for its legitimacy, from a Zionist perspective, just to contrast it with Hizbu'llah's point of view.	2005-03-29

Of course.  Right now, we're seeing some carefully organized terrorism from Muslim fanatics.  Raphael Israeli explains the nature of it and has some recommendations.<br /><br />I find this topic interesting, given that I feel that there is plenty at stake.  The United States and Europe are Western democracies that are relatively free and rich.  We have plenty of strength as well as plenty we can lose.  The Arabs have a huge amount of land and resources, so they have plenty to lose as well.  By the way, Israel is small and has rather little land or resources, so it has less at stake, but it is threatened as well.<br /><br />The author chooses the term \\"Islamikaze\\" rather than \\"suicide bomber.\\"  He explains that suicidal people plan to take their own lives and carry out their own plans to do that.  On the contrary, Islamikazes follow the plans of others to kill a perceived enemy.  In any case, I see their actions as manifestly counterproductive and therefore I think they merit serious study.<br /><br />Israeli starts by sampling Muslim reactions to the horrors of 9/11/2001.  These reactions are clearly a cause for concern.  The author is suspicious of the long-term loyalty of Muslim immigrants to Western nations.  While I am not quite so concerned about loyalty of Muslims in general, I do think we need to separate the sheep from the goats here.  I take sedition seriously.  And the author does demonstrate that there is a serious cultural intent on the part of many Muslims not to cooperate with the West but to wreck it.<br /><br />Reading this book, I could see from the wild misrepresentations of the West and of Zionism that the Enemy of Islamist fantasies is very different than real-life Westerners and Zionists.  That is not a good sign.  Now, what about our views of the terrorists?  Do they really seek to impose an arbitrary tyranny on everyone?  Israeli shows that for the most part, that's exactly their plan.<br /><br />Israeli shows that just as the Germans used extravagant libels, incitement, and aggression against the Jews to start their attacks on their neighbors, Muslim fanatics are using libels, incitement, and aggression against Jews to start similar attacks on the West.  I can see that support for such libels and incitement have become a litmus test of sorts for some terrorist sympathizers.  But Israeli turns that litmus test around, quite properly in my opinion.  He shows that once we refuse to support the antizionist libels and taunts, we've taken a decisive step towards opposing the Islamikazes.<br /><br />Well, what is to be done about the Islamikaze attacks on the West?  The author recommends truth and reciprocity.  His specific recommendations include:<br /><br />* Forming an alliance of Western and Democratic States (AWADS)<br /><br />* Having AWADS adopt an iron-clad definition of terror<br /><br />* Importing books and culture to the West from Muslim nations only to the extent that these nations allow free flow of similar Western assets into their lands<br /><br />* Forbidding by law the dissemination of hate and acting upon that law<br /><br />* Accepting support from Saudi Arabia in building mosques in the West only if there is parallel permission from Saudi Arabia to build churches and synagogues in Saudi Arabia without incitement or hatred there<br /><br />* Stopping transfer of military supplies from AWADS nations to non-AWADS nations<br /><br />* Basing economic aid to non-AWADS states on human rights in those states<br /><br />* Controlling immigration of anti-Western immigrants to non-AWADS states<br /><br />Do these ideas sound politically incorrect or extreme?

His specific recommendations include: <br /> <br />* Forming an alliance of Western and Democratic States (AWADS) <br />* Having AWADS adopt an iron-clad definition of terror <br />* Importing books and culture to the West from Muslim nations only to the extent that these nations allow free flow of similar Western assets into their lands <br />* Forbidding by law the dissemination of hate and acting upon that law <br />* Accepting support from Saudi Arabia in building mosques in the West only if there is parallel permission from Saudi Arabia to build churches and synagogues in Saudi Arabia without incitement or hatred there <br />* Stopping transfer of military supplies from AWADS nations to non-AWADS nations <br />* Basing economic aid to non-AWADS states on human rights in those states <br />* Controlling immigration of anti-Western immigrants to non-AWADS states <br /> <br />Do these ideas sound politically incorrect or extreme?  Well, so does a big war!  I think these are ideas we need to consider now, when we have a chance to reflect on them somewhat dispassionately. <br />	2005-03-29

Benko was a Candidate for the World Championship on two occasions, 1959 and 1962.<br /><br />In the first part of the book, Benko tells about his life and annotates more than 130 of his best games.  These include games against Botvinnik, Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian, and Fischer.  It includes a fascinating description of life in Hungary during World War Two and of life under Communist rule in Hungary after the war.  In 1957, Benko escaped from Hungary via Iceland to the West.  Seven years later, Benko, now an American, was given amnesty by Hungary and was able to return there.  Eventually, he wound up spending half his time in Hungary and half in the US.<br /><br />Benko includes a section on his development of the Benko Gambit (1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 b5).  There are eleven games in this section, all Benko Gambits.  Benko has Black in ten of them.  The eleventh is a game with White, against Berry.<br /><br />The book also has a fine section by John Watson analyzing Benko's openings both with White and Black and concludes with a large selection of Benko's chess problems and compositions.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.	2005-03-28

Is it a good idea?  Can we \\"terraform\\" Mars?<br /><br />The author, writing in 1996, says that for about 20 billion to 30 billion dollars, we could do it.  For a project starting now, launch of the return vehicle would be in about ten years, launch of the astronauts a couple of years later, and astronaut return less than three years after that.<br /><br />What do I think of this?  It's going to be expensive and risky.  The statistics on unmanned Mars missions has not been completely encouraging.  Manned missions are even trickier.<br /><br />Is it a good idea?  Well, let's see what Zubrin has to say.  \\"We are not sending a crew to Mars to set a new altitude record for the Aviation Almanac.  We are going to Mars to explore a planet; to determine if it ever harbored life in the past and to survey its potential as a future home for a new branch of human civilization.\\"<br /><br />I think going to Mars is a very reasonable idea, and we'll need that attitude to get there.  If enough people agree and if we're willing to commit to it, we ought to try it.  I think exploration of the solar system is indeed our birthright, and we ought to do it whether or not we think there is (or was) life on Mars.  I think \\"ad astra\\" (\\"to the stars\\") is a good motto.  The meek will inherit the Earth.  The rest of us will aim a little higher.<br /><br />Zubrin now explains his idea for an initial manned mission.  He's proposed sending the return module there first.  After Zubrin said this, I think most folks started to realize that it's a good idea.  Now, what about the trajectory?  A fast mission is better than a slow one.  And the author explains that a \\"conjunction\\" mission is much better than an \\"opposition\\" mission.  The former spends much more time on the Martian surface, is less expensive, and appears less risky.<br /><br />Zubrin discusses crew size, and concludes that a 4-person crew is probably best.  And there is a nice chapter on \\"killing the dragons, avoiding the sirens.\\"  The \\"dragons\\" include risks from radiation, zero-gravity, Martian weather, contamination of Mars, and back-contamination of the Earth.  Yes, there are risks, but they can be handled.  A \\"siren\\" is the belief that we need lunar bases before going to Mars.  Zubrin explains that such bases are not necessary.<br /><br />The author discusses advanced propulsion technologies that might make it easier for us to go to Mars, although his plans can be implemented with present technologies.  I think that we need to keep developing advanced technologies and that they'll help us. But I agree that even without them, we can still get to Mars.<br /><br />We can go to Mars if we make a serious commitment to do so.  But what about the package deal?  Can we terraform Mars, even if we are committed to do so?  Would it take too long?  Do we have the resources as a species to do such a thing?  Zubrin delves into these questions.  He asks, \\"Can we transform Mars to make it fully habitable?\\"  On the, um, surface, \\"the idea appears to be utterly fantastical, simply science fiction.\\"  But he points out that it hasn't been long since traveling to the Moon was science fiction.<br /><br />Zubrin shows that there is a possibility that Mars could be terraformed.  The Martian regolith (the soil and rock near the surface) could indeed contain enough carbon dioxide to create an atmospheric surface pressure of 300 millibar were it all released.  And we could trigger the process that would produce a \\"greenhouse effect.\\"  Release of \\"greenhouse\\" gases would raise the temperature of the surface, increasing the release of more greenhouse gases.  We might be able to achieve a pressure of 100 millibar in only a couple of centuries.  That is something a committed civilization can actually do.<br /><br />Of course, to accomplish all this, we probably will need some of those advanced propulsion technologies that Zubrin discusses.<br /><br />Going to Mars is serious business.  Here is aquote from the author:<br /><br />\\"I would say that failure to terraform Mars constitutes failure to live up to our human nature and a betrayal of our responsibility as members of the community of life itself.\\"<br /><br />I think that's a pretty clear statement.  I agree with it.ious business.

I dislike Empire.  I dislike Imperialism.  Now, I think Tariq Ali and I probably agree to some extent about disliking British imperialism.  And I think we even agree that the United States, a very powerful nation, has thrown its weight around sometimes, and in a counterproductive manner.  And that the Monroe Doctrine has to be looked at as an example of us throwing our weight around, good or bad.<br /><br />Now, that really ought to start a serious discussion about how we Americans are actually affecting the lives of, say, impoverished potters in Guatemala.  Are we helping them overall?  Do we have little effect on their lives?  Or are we actively hurting them?  If we're doing something Wrong, could we stop doing it?  Yes, these would be interesting questions.  But Ali is not the one to discuss them, as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />One problem is that the book spends some time discussing the Arab war against Israel.  I think Ali and I may agree that anyone who picks the wrong side to oppose in this war is immoral and dishonest.  Unfortunately, we've picked different sides.<br /><br />Ali feels that the Arab-Israeli war is important because the US has jumped into it and backed the wrong side.  I feel it is important because the United Nations has jumped into it and backed the wrong side. I feel that the contamination of the international information supply with arbitrary antizionist lies is serious, and is part of a greater fight against truth in general.  Ali feels that the United States and Israel ought to be condemned for supporting each other.<br /><br />Now this could raise an interesting question.  Suppose the United States were truly awful.  And suppose Israel, surrounded by Arab nations that might be politically dominated at any time by racist antizionists, agreed to accept support from the United States, just to try to avoid being overrun.  Ought we condemn Israel were it to do that?<br /><br />My answer to that question would be that I expect people and nations who are being threatened with obliteration to fight for their lives, right or wrong, whether they do it or not.  But Ali is too busy complaining about Israel and the United States to ask such a question.  At least, we both realize that politics is politics, and that large, powerful nations can rarely be trusted to act morally when their interests are at stake.<br /><br />Now, what do I think of this book?  I think it is dishonest and immoral.  I think Ali's views are on the extreme right wing.  And I think it might be a good idea to see if his comments on Rachel Corrie are anything like Joseph Goebbels' comments on Horst Wessel.<br /><br />Well, what would I advise?  I think if you are interested in what Ali has to say, I'd advise learning enough about American foreign policy and about the Arab-Israeli war to judge books such as this one for yourself.nited States, just to try to avoid being overrun.

Why is it that when they are asked about Israeli misdoings, they not only deny many of them but tend to find most of them so irrelevant to the problem of antizionism that they do not deign to discuss them?  Well, I am a Zionist.  The author is going to tell us all what is wrong with me.<br /><br />I think it is fine to tell people what their mental shortcomings are.  We can start with visual illusions and the like.  Next we can address questions demanding some intellect and show where many of us go wrong and why.  But it's always a little dicey to propose to explain what psychological inadequacies are present in the minds of, say, Christians, or Pagans, or Democrats, or Republicans.  It is an understatement to say that the shoe may not fit the intended wearer.<br /><br />The author begins by defending her right to single out Israel for criticism.  Okay, that is fair.  But only if such criticism is both warranted and relevant.  If I want to talk about the tsunami off Sumatra, I'll dismiss what you say about Zionism as irrelevant.  And when I complain about Arab antizionist propaganda, I do indeed find that arbitrary criticism of Israel can be so irrelevant that even were it justified, it simply precludes discussion of my topic.<br /><br />I completely agree with Rose when she says that Israel has been anything but a bystander to its own history.  But it has indeed been a bystander to the racist refusal of some Arabs to abide human rights for Jews in the Middle East.<br /><br />Next, we find out that people like me are dogmatic and can find no fault with what she calls \\"Zionism\\" and what it turns out I call \\"human rights.\\"  You support it or you don't.  Well, she's right about that.  If you say you are against human rights, your goals are probably different than mine.  If you want to convince me that you are for human rights, I'll insist that you be for human rights for Arabs and Jews as well as for everyone else.  But I am willing to consider the consequences of being against human rights.  I happen to think it is misleading to call me dogmatic, but I will let that go.<br /><br />Rose calls Israel \\"schizophrenic\\" for wanting both peace (80% want a deal with the Arabs, even if it isn't a very good one and even if it may not last) and self-defence (80% supported attacking the terrorists).  As Rose says, one can see that the numbers don't add (actually, I can't see any reason why they ought to add to 100%).  Um, I think the author is the one with a mental problem here.<br /><br />The book gets a little boring after this.  Yes, she does claim that the Holocaust is not merely an excuse to justify Israeli misdoings but also a real event which has affected some of the decisions by Israeli leaders!  But this comment is hardly profound, and she has nothing more of value to say on the matter.<br /><br />Rose writes as if she is all in favor of reason and justice.  But I think that reality and justice would disintegrate her arguments much as sunlight would disintegrate a vampire.  She needs to ask herself where she stands on human rights.  Is she really willing to demand equal rights for everyone, herself included?  As near as I can tell, she isn't.to consider the consequences of being against human rights.

It talks about Western views of the Islamic world.  And it is thorough.  It does spend quite a while discussing the views of Ed Said.  And it even mentions many of Said's critics and quotes them fairly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when Said writes nonsense, the author basically lets it pass, taking him to task only for some of his more extreme language.  When others criticize some of Said's brayings, the critics are often condemned in no uncertain terms.  Given how awful Said was, I find this inexcusably dishonest.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I liked the book so much that I'm actually giving it two stars!  Some of the criticisms of the Zionists are very thoughtful.  It is true that we don't always predict the future accurately.  And it is true that consistent failures of the antizionists to predict the future would not in itself prove that antizionism is somehow Wrong.  In addition, there are plenty of facts in this book.  It isn't completely worthless!	2005-03-26

And Here My Troubles Began	Books	5	6	8	N	N	A masterpiece	Art Spiegelman has done a terrific job with this pair of um, comic books about his father's experiences during World War Two.  And yes, depicting the people as mice, cats, dogs, and pigs is an excellent idea, and certainly not racist.  If the authorities demanded to kill you and were hunting you down, just how would you see people?<br /><br />What makes these books so impressive is the vivid no-punches-pulled approach.  Even so, if anything, the overall horror is understated, given that Spiegelman's parents were among the survivors.<br /><br />The whole idea of being hunted down arbtrarily takes some getting used to.  How would we in America feel if a law were passed, say, to murder all people whose last names began with a Y?  Or all those born in, say, 1974?  Or, to make the analogy a little better, all Pagans?<br /><br />Normally, people who are outlawed en masse try to flee (sometimes using force to fight their way across a border).  Others try to find allies, some try to stay and fight (that usually does not work well), some try to get off the outlawed list, perhaps by converting.  And we see how poorly this worked in Poland in World War Two.  One genuine chance looked like a complete scam, namely moving to Japan.  A few people tried it and saved themselves, as Japan turned out to be relatively safe in World War Two.<br /><br />Most of the rest wound up stuck in Poland, and they ran out of options.  Many tried to hide, including the author's parents.  We see the bribery involved in doing that.  But there were huge risks of being caught.  And the book addresses the question of what to do if some innocent man finds your hiding place.  Do you kill him?  If you don't, he really will tell the authorities about you.<br /><br />What do you do when you are about to be caught?  Well, either you kill yourself or surrender, hoping that you'll get lucky and survive.  And we see both ideas tried in these books.<br /><br />I came away from these books with the strong feeling that I would never want to be a cat or a mouse in this situation.  For those who are thinking about being cats, I would say that there is always a better, more moral, and less counterproductive way to deal with neighbors you dislike than genocide.  For those who are thinking about being mice, I would advise knowing how to flee and maybe knowing a little about self-defence.  That won't always work very well, but if enough people were good enough at it, we'd be less likely to have mass slaughters.<br /><br />What about the rest of us?  What about those who simply avert their eyes as people are demonized and outlawed?  Well, at the end, some of us have a chance to be heroes, by taking great risks to do something moral.  But by then, it is a little late.  I think we all have a duty when things appear calm to be on the lookout for the symptoms of arbitrary discrimination and demonization that can lead to having the authorities legalize mass murder.  And these books are excellent at making us think about such questions.<br /><br />I highly recommend these books.that I would never want to be a cat or a mouse in this situation.

And there's material about what happened to Pagan customs when the Christians took over.  Some, such as maypoles and caroling, appear to have survived.<br /><br />I got the feeling from reading the book that Pagans were simply too tolerant to do well in the fight against the Christians.  The Christians weren't tolerant at all, and so they tended to win battles against the Pagans.  Of course, having a worse product to sell, the Christians had to fight to have any chance.<br /><br />There were decisive defeats for the Pagans in the Roman Empire in the fifth century, including the brutal murder of Hypatia.  And then, in 782 AD came a severe blow to Paganism in Western Europe: Charlemagne murdered 4500 Pagans who preferred death to conversion.  Within three centuries, Scandinavia converted to Christianity, and that basically left Lithuania as the lone Pagan holdout in Europe.  Pagans fled to Lithuania, but eventually the Christians took over there as well.<br /><br />What did the triumph of Christianity mean?  Well, I think it meant that people gave up the worship of the Goddesses and Gods in favor of a foreign atheistic religion, namely Christianity.  It meant abandoning local and private worship in favor of an autocratic religious tyranny.  I think the book glosses over the loss of freedom involved in giving up Paganism.<br /><br />The book then recounts Pagan reaffirmation in Europe.  There isn't much to that.  A few Lithuanians stayed loyal to their old traditions into the eighteenth century.  And some Gypsies arrived in Europe, but in keeping with Christian tradition, they were dealt with severely.<br /><br />What is happening in Europe today?  Is Paganism making a comeback?  Given that people are different and fickle, there are obvious reasons to choose among many Gods and Goddesses.  In addition, Christianity has never been morally or theologically sound.  In an age where Christianity is being replaced by modern humanism, are Pagans being tolerated?  Is it safe for them to come out of the broom closet?<br /><br />Well, yes, Pagans are finally being tolerated.  As the book says, the two biggest reasons for Europeans wanting to become Pagans today are to adopt a less chauvinistic religion than Christianity and to adopt a religion that takes a pro-ecology stand.  I think these are fine reasons as well.<br /><br />Jones and Pennick mention that Iceland, which shamefully converted to Christianity in 1000 AD, officially recognized Asatru (worship of the Aesir) as a religion in 1973.  But the book does not say why this happened.  The reason is that Iceland, as has been traditional in Scandinavia, has a Church tax.  There is a State Church.  But such a tax is inherently unfair to anyone who might not want to be a Lutheran.  And so Norse Paganism was given some rights as an official minority religion.  The issue was really about taxes, not about religion.<br /><br />Overall, this is a readable and reasonable work.  I recommend it.any Gods and Goddesses.

If you want to start playing the Ruy with White, you ought to get a repertoire book or two.  And this is a very reasonable choice.<br /><br />No, it doesn't cover the Exchange Variation.  That is the whole point.  Larry Kaufman's book (The Chess Advantage in Black and White) is a fine repertoire book that has White playing the Exchange Variation, so if you want to do that, get his book, not this one.<br /><br />But if you want to play the real Ruy Lopez, get this book.<br /><br />You probably already have some ideas about how you want to meet some variations of the Ruy.  The reason you need a repertoire book is so that you can get ideas about how to meet some of the lines you don't know much about.  And this book is great at explaining the ideas behind the various defences, as well as giving some specific lines to play.<br /><br />Of course, the book is a few years old already.  But I think that is not a big problem.  Theory hasn't changed all that much, and the ideas that are presented are, for the most part, valid.  You will want to stay up-to-date on some lines, of course.<br /><br />The author recommends playing the anti-Marshall with 8 a4.  That is not a bad line, but I certainly prefer allowing Black to play the Marshall.  That's not a problem with the book, of course, merely a personal preference.<br /><br />I do have a minor complaint about the book, however.  Namely, suppose you read this book and then play, um, me.  What will happen?  Will you be prepared for what I play in the opening?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />You see, as Black, I'll play the Berlin Defence.  Emms spends twelve pages on this defence and gives the ideas behind it.  But this book is faulty on both the ideas and the lines if you play me.  I've played the Berlin for over thirty years as Black.  And when I get into the endgame Emms recommends, my first choice is always to get my King to the Queenside, to b7 or c6, where it is both safe and active.  If you take the advice in this book, you'll let me do that.  The line is 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 Nf6 4 0-0 Nxe4 5 d4 Nd6 6 Bxc6 dxc6 7 dxe5 Nf5 8 Qxd8+ Kxd8 9 Nc3.<br /><br />At this point, I may play 9...Bd7, which this book does not consider.  But even if I play 9...Ne7, 9...h6, or 9...Be6, all of which the book does consider, you still will not be expecting my King to head for the Queenside, with my pawns on b6, c7, and c5.  On top of this, recent high-level grandmaster games seem to be confirming the power of my strategy.<br /><br />And one more tidbit.  The book has a good chapter on the Open Variation: 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 a6 4 Ba4 Nf6 5 0-0 Nxe4 6 d4.  Well, there is an unsound and flaky try for Black here, which I occasionally spring on folks in 5-minute games, namely 6...exd4 (the infamous Riga Variation).  The book gives some good advice here, but it stops just one move short.  It advises 7 Re1 d5 8 Nxd4 Bd6 9 Nxc6 Bxh2+ 10 Kh1! (not Kxh2, which gives Black a perpetual) 10...Qh4 11 Rxe4+ dxe4 12 Qd8+ Qxd8 13 Nxd8+ Kxd8 14 Kxh2.  Yes, but the book needs to give you just one more move, because when I play 14...Be3, half my opponents play 15 Nc3? They are not happy when I reply 15...c5, winning material.  This silly trap is the whole point of this defence, so the book should have warned everyone.<br /><br />On the whole, however, I think it is an excellent book. I recommend it.e it is both safe and active.  If you take the advice in this book, you'll let me do that.  The line is 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 Nf6 4 0-0 Nxe4 5 d4 Nd6 6 Bxc6 dxc6 7 dxe5 Nf5 8 Qxd8+ Kxd8 9 Nc3. <br /> <br />At this point, I may play 9...Bd7, which this book does not consider.  But even if I play 9...Ne7, 9...h6, or 9...Be6, all of which the book does consider, you still will not be expecting my King to head for the Queenside, with my pawns on b6, c7, and c5.  On top of this, recent high-level grandmaster games seem to be confirming the power of my strategy. <br /> <br />And one more tidbit.  The book has a good chapter on the Open Variation: 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 a6 4 Ba4 Nf6 5 0-0 Nxe4 6 d4.  Well, there is an unsound and flaky try for Black here, which I occasionally spring on folks in 5-minute games, namely 6...exd4 (the infamous Riga Variation).  The book gives some good advice here, but it stops just one move short.  It advises 7 Re1 d5 8 Nxd4 Bd6 9 Nxc6 Bxh2+ 10 Kh1! (not Kxh2, which gives Black a perpetual) 10...Qh4 11 Rxe4+ dxe4 12 Qd8+ Qxd8 13 Nxd8+ Kxd8 14 Kxh2.  Yes, but the book needs to give you just one more move, because when I play 14...Be3, half my opponents play 15 Nc3? They are not happy when I reply 15...c5, winning material.  This silly trap is the whole point of this defence, so the book should have warned everyone. <br /> <br />On the whole, however, I think it is an excellent book. I recommend it.	2005-03-24
303318:US	53071109	R1GBC23X2ULIW5	1569245568	804156228	Inside Israel: The Faiths, the People, and the Modern Conflicts of the World's Holiest Land	Books	3	1	2	N	N	An interesting book	This is a collection of fourteen essays and excerpts from books about the Arab-Israeli conflict.  There are a number of different opinions presented, and that's good.  But I think too many ideas are overlooked.<br /><br />David Shipler starts with an overview of the conflict.  Next is Karen Armstrong.  She appears to sneeringly dismiss any claims by others to Muslim land, but is all sweetness when she begs all reasonable people to share their non-Muslim land with the Muslims.  And she discusses the power of \\"myth\\" here.  But this misses the point.  It is absurd to think that the five million Jews of Israel would happily agree, in the name of equality, to be oppressed by the Arabs!  And even more absurd to claim that the only reason the Jews haven't been reasonable enough to surrender is the power of some myth.  Human rights are no myth.<br /><br />Paul Johnson supplies a very reasonable discussion of the history of the establishment of the State of Israel.  Next is Meron Benvenisti, who has the same problem as Armstrong: what is Arab is Arab, what's Jewish is negotiable.  After that, David Grossman does an excellent job of documenting Arab hatred of Israel.  But he's somewhat biased.  He shows that the Jews wanted the Land.  Now the Arabs want it.  What symmetry!  He ignores the fact that there is a big difference.  The Arabs have millions of square kilometers.  The Jews are willing to let the Arabs keep it all.  Meanwhile, I'd say that Arabs who insist on grabbing all the Jewish land are being just a little bit greedy.<br /><br />We then see an excellent and thoughtful article by David Horovitz on what living in Israel has been like.  And a silly article by Deborah Sontag.  Sontag's article includes some interviews of Arabs.  Out of context, it would be pure propaganda.  In this book, the other articles provide a little balance.<br /><br />Adina Hoffman has an interesting article in which she shows the difficulty of tracing house ownership.  This article made me even more convinced that the rights to a house should never be \\"returned\\" to those who never actually owned it.  Do we really want those who claim to be heirs (or descendants, or friends) of Jews or Arabs who had their land swiped in Libya, Poland, and Israel to be given houses they never owned, never improved, and never paid property taxes on?  Hoffman does not come up with this question herself, but I sure did.<br /><br />Saul Bellow doesn't want Israel to fight.  Well, that is fine.  It's not that bad an idea; those who fight can get hurt.  What he wants people to do when they get attacked, however, is not clear.  Nor is it clear how he'll stop people from fighting back.  Israel is not the only nation in the world that will ever have to decide whether to defend itself or not.<br /><br />P. J. O'Rourke makes a couple of good points.  He says that reality is not a zero-sum game.  That is, people make something of what they have.  Both sides can prosper.  On the other hand, politics is zero-sum.  That is, the argument is made that what is good for one side is necessarily bad for the other.<br /><br />Uri Savir tells of trying to negotiate.  But over what?  I think there's always someone you can find who will want to lay claim to what is yours.  But unless you get to negotiate over what is theirs too, I think \\"negotiations\\" are going to be counterproductive.  The land-poor Israelis will feel cheated because it is their land that will be stolen.  The Arabs will feel cheated because even though the principle has been established that they are entitled to steal Jewish land, they won't get all of it.  So I was unimpressed with Savir.<br /><br />Anthony Lewis has an interesting article in which he doubts that a new Arab state will benefit anyone.  I have to agree with that assessment.  The fact that we disagree politically does not change that.<br /><br />Ed Said says that the Arab and Jewish narratives are incompatible.  He implies that the Jews are wrong but will not change their minds.  But I think the whole idea of narratives is silly.  If we want to get our history right, no one is stopping us.  There is one truth, not many truths.  And he pretends to be realistic and moderate when he proposes to let evil Israel exist, as long as it ceases to be a refuge for Jews (he demands to get rid of the Law of Return).  Isn't that the least the grateful Jews can do if the Arabs agree not to crush them?  Well, no, it isn't.  There are over 5 million Jews in Israel.  And if we are to have peace, they will need to have rights too.<br /><br />The book finishes with an article by Robert Stone, who makes the obvious statement that the Arabs won't leave unless forced to do so.  That's a truly stupid note to end on.  After all, the Arabs have millions of square kilometers to live on.  The Middle Eastern Jews are restricted to Israel.  If any side is going to be bought out of the Levant in peacetime, it will be the Arabs.<br /><br />There are some interesting excerpts and articles in this book, but there's much better material out there.f we want to get our history right, no one is stopping us.

White can play the Exchange Variation with 4 Bxc6.  But suppose we play the main line with 4 Ba4 Nf6 5 0-0 Be7 6 Re1 b5 7 Bb3.  Black can now play 7...Bb7, the Trajkovic, but this book tells us how to get an advantage with 8 d4.  So Black plays 7...0-0, threatening to play the Marshall.  Now what?<br /><br />Nunn and Harding analyze just about everything here.  The best options are an anti-Marshall with 8 d4, an anti-Marshall with 8 a4, or simply 8 c3, calling Black's bluff in a sense.  Sure, White may get a good game with 8 a4 b4 (8...Bb7 9 d3 Re8 is probably a better try for Black here) 9 d3 d6 10 a5, but I think White is better off letting Black play the Marshall.  And this book tells us how to do that.<br /><br />That means 8 c3 d5 (the Marshall) 9 exd5.  Now there is a sideline that you have to know for White.  Black can play 9...e4.  You have to play 10 dxc6 (not 10 Ng5) exf3 11 d4 (not 11 Qxf3).<br /><br />After 9 exd5, the main line is 9...Nxd5 10 Nxe5 Nxe5 11 Rxe5.  Originally, Marshall tried 11...Nf6 against Capablanca and lost.  It's not a good line for Black, and we learn to play 12 d4 against it.  Against 11...Bb7, we play 12 Qf3 Bd6 13 Bxd5.  That gets us back to the main line, 11...c6.  We now play 12 d4 Bd6 13 Re1 Qh4 14 g3 Qh3.  At this point, I like to play 15 Re4 g5! 16 Qf3!<br /><br />However, the main line for White seems even better.  After 15 Be3 Bg4 16 Qd3 Rae8 17 Nd2 Re6 18 a4, Black has a problem.  I think the best move is Spassky's 18...Qh5, but after 19 axb5 axb5 20 Nf1, White is the only one with winning chances.  These days, most folks try 18...bxa4 with Black.<br /><br />This book suggests 18...f5 as the main line here, but I think this is no good.  A few years ago, even Harding, one of the authors, agreed.  It was pointed out that 19 axb5 (a move not in this book) ought to win for White.  The problem with the position is strategic; White's counterplay on the Queenside is just too much.  If 19...f4 20 Bxf4.<br /><br />I used to play the Marshall for Black.  Now I play it for White.  I was considering giving it up as Black because White rarely let me play it.  But a little over 20 years ago, a good player let me try it with Black, and here is what happened.  I tried that main line, all the way through 18 a4 f5.  I felt good about all this.  I wanted to get in ...f4, and I thought that I'd get the chance to do that.<br /><br />As I said, 19 axb5 is best here, but White tried 19 f4, stopping my intended ...f4.  19 f4 was considered a losing move in the book, so I felt pretty good for a little while.  I played 19...Rfe8 (19...Rh6 is probably a better try) 20 axb5 Bxf4 after which we both thought for a while.  This book gives 20...Bxf4! an exclam, but to put it mildly, I disagree.<br /><br />While I was thinking, it occurred to me that 18...f5 had been a mistake.  Sure, I might be okay after 21 gxf4 Rg6.  But almost anything else seemed to be really good for White!  I silently prayed to Caissa \\"Please save me!  If you do, I swear I'll never play 18...f5 again here!\\"  I was already thinking of giving up the Marshall completely with Black.<br /><br />My opponent played 21 Bf2 and I almost resigned on the spot.  Unless I took White's pawn on b5, White's Queenside counterplay would be fatal.  So I decided to play 21...axb5 and resign if White played 22 Bxd5 cxd5 23 Qxb5.  Instead, Caissa answered my prayer, and White inexplicably tried 22 Bxd5 cxd5 23 Nf1? Re2 24 b3.  When I played 24...Bg5, White couldn't find a defence and resigned.<br /><br />Needless to say, I have not tried the Marshall for Black since then.  But I think the book is great (albeit a little dated) for those of you who do.  And it's also excellent for those of us who play it with White.axb5 (a move not in this book) ought to win for White.

An active volcano?  Or maybe a geyser?  Then this book is for you!  Beautifully illustrated, with excellent maps, it tells all about what you can see and what it all means.<br /><br />Rosaly Lopes, an award-winning volcanologist, describes the different types of volcanic eruptions, and then gives some advice and rules for visiting volcanoes safely.  If you are serious about being in a potentially dangerous area, that means helmets, gas masks, gloves, sturdy boots, and eye protection.  She also gives some advice on volcano photography.<br /><br />Next are field guides to visiting specific volcanoes in Hawaii, the continental USA, Italy, Greece, Iceland, Costa Rica, and the West Indies.  There's all kinds of material about each of the major volcanoes and geysers there.  In addition, there is some practical advice.  Don't carry a purse in Naples!  Lopes had two of them stolen less than twelve hours apart there.  In Iceland, we see a photo of the Viti (\\"Hell\\") crater with a thick layer of ice over part of it, proving that Hell can freeze over.<br /><br />Lopes has personal accounts of her visits to many of these volcanoes.  That includes her first visit to Arenal, which could have been dangerous and is used as an example to show the importance of knowing exactly where one is and just how dangerous the volcano is.  And there's all sorts of anecdotal material.  For example, Mount Kilimanjaro, a very beautiful African volcano was given as a birthday present from Queen Victoria to her grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany.<br /><br />This entire book is simply fascinating.  I highly recommend it.	2005-03-23

What do bright kids at a top-notch college do in their spare time?  Say, during the summer?<br /><br />Well, as the ABBA song says, \\"I'll have to go to Las Vegas or Monaco.  And make a fortune in a game; my life will never be the same.  Money, money, money!\\"<br /><br />Would kids do such a thing?  Um, you bet.<br /><br />Can the house be beaten?  Obviously.  It can even be beaten at roulette if you find a defective wheel.  Blackjack is favorable to the player, but you have to be able to count cards acceptably and have a big enough bankroll to make winning likely.  And you won't win for long.  The casinos will notice that you are winning and will not care why.  They'll simply blacklist you.<br /><br />Are M.I.T. students the ones to try it?  Well, the M.I.T. mascot is the beaver.  Just as the beaver is the engineer of the animal world...<br /><br />In this suspense-filled book we find out.  No, silly.  Not whether the M.I.T. students are the animals of the engineering world.  Whether the M.I.T. students can win.<br /><br />Will their training at M.I.T. help them?  As an M.I.T. cheer goes, \\"Why are we going to win tonight and do so well?  We've got the Devil on our side 'cause Tech is Hell!\\"<br /><br />The students mastered keeping a simple count.  You call all cards above a 9 \\"-1\\" and all those below a 7 \\"+1.\\"  Doing this well takes plenty of practice!  A big plus count is very favorable for the player.  You should divide the count by the number of cards remaining to get a truer count.<br /><br />If you have a team, it's easier.  That means there are several card counters.  All they need to do is tell someone (by code words or signals) what the count is and that person can sit down and bet huge sums right from the start.  If the casino shuffles the decks whenever someone new sits down, that's no problem.  They can simply wait for the decks to become good.  They can do the counting themselves or even have others count for them.  When the decks are good, they raise the size of their bets.  We find out about a few miscellaneous advanced techniques that some of the players used to get even more of an advantage.<br /><br />Of course, the team has to act the part.  The players have to act like mildly inebriated high rollers.  Or beginners.  Or something other than what they really are.  If the house gets suspicious, they have to split, fast.  And by \\"split,\\" I don't mean splitting the hand, but getting out of the casino.  They need to stay calm as they do so.<br /><br />Speaking of acting, do you wonder what happens when a sexy Las Vegas lady walks up to one of the M.I.T. guys and asks him to buy her a drink?  Well, in this book, we find out.<br /><br />Of course, even with the odds favoring you, you are still gambling.  We see the team grab over $300,000 dollars in a single night.  But we also see a player lose $100,000 on just two consecutive hands.<br /><br />And your life really is never the same.  In addition, for better or worse, you can't just keep doing it.

Pat Dasch clearly did a fine job as editor.<br /><br />There is an introduction by Jonathan Lunine.  We see the significance of solar system ice as the source of the Earth's water and of life.  Robert Bindschadler then has a section on ice on Earth.  He explains that Ice is 2 % of the Earth's water.  Glaciation began 2.3 billion years ago, when the Earth was half its present age.  And there's much more on the nature and history of our planet's ice.<br /><br />There's clearly no reason to study ice on Venus, so Bryan Butler discusses the potential for finding ice on Mercury and the Moon.  He thinks it is likely that ther are significant ice deposits on Mercury in permanently shaded regions in polar craters there.  And there may be some on the Moon as well.<br /><br />Next is a section by Tobias Owen on the role of icy planetesimals and indigenous rocks in providing our Earth with an atmosphere.  After that, Michael Mellon discusses the nature of the Martian polar caps.  Ice can exist only near the poles on Mars; nearer the equator, it simply sublimates.  Paul Schenk then covers the solar system's icy satellites, including the terrain of the Jovian moons.  And John Stansberry tells us about Triton, Pluto, and the Kuiper Belt.<br /><br />The final chapter is by Dale Cruikshank, on comets.  As we discover, comets appear to have supplied the Earth with a significant amount of water.<br /><br />If we humans are going to explore the solar system, the amount of water on these surfaces may be of critical importance to us.  In addition, the mechanisms that cause Earth to have as much water as it does may be present in other stellar systems, which could indicate something about the chances of life elsewhere in the Galaxy.<br /><br />This is an interesting book for laymen and scientists, and I recommend it.	2005-03-22

The author, the famous Israeli general Yigal Allon, is clearly an expert on the topic.<br /><br />It is well known that for many centuries, the Jews did not fight at all as a people.  This book describes the creation of the first military formation in modern Jewish history, and traces it through the six-day war of 1967.<br /><br />Allon's narrative begins over 100 years ago.  While modern Zionists did create a chain of villages in the Levant prior to 1900, the first use of Jewish arms sprang from the Kishinev pogrom of 1903, in the Ukraine.  After that, Jews in a small nearby town called Gomel acquired weapons and prepared for an attack.  Later that year, when they were indeed attacked, they fought back, first against the hooligans and later against the Czar's troops who intervened to protect the thugs.  The fighting lasted three days.  The next year, some of the Jews who had fought at Gomel moved to the Levant.<br /><br />In 1907, the Gomel group founded Bar Giora and chose Israel Shochat as their leader.  Bar Giora was a secret defense organization, but in 1909, it was reorganized to form an open self-defence force, Hashomer (The Watchman).  By 1914, Hashomer was a military force with a duty to preserve the Levantine Jewish population (which by then was over 80,000 people).  It even considered conquering Jerusalem.<br /><br />By the winter of 1917, the Jewish population was indeed reduced, but 56,000 Jews remained and they formed the nucleus of what was to become the state of Israel a little more than thirty years later.<br /><br />There are detailed discussions of Jewish defence against Arab pogroms in the 1920s and 1930s.  Hashomer was replaced by the Haganah.  We learn about the British White Paper of 1939 and the fight against it, including some the boats used to try to break the British blockade of the Levant.  There is a discussion of Jewish plans to defend the Levant from a possible Nazi invasion, and of a number of Levantine Jews who carried out operations in Europe during World War Two (most of whom simply died).  And there is a long section on the post-World War Two struggle against the British.<br /><br />There is an excellent history of the War of Independence.  The book concludes with forty pages on the history of Israel's military from the beginning of 1949 through the end of the six-day war.<br /><br />I recommend this superbly written book.a possible Nazi invasion, and of a number of Levantine Jews who carried out operations in Europe during World War Two (most of whom simply died).

And people are indeed getting hurt on both sides.  Ought we document abuses of human rights?  Of course.  What about manipulation of the media?  Ought we document that as well?  Yes!  And a book that did that honestly would be worthwhile.  But this book isn't it.<br /><br />Joceyln Grange leads off with a malicious misrepresentation of Israeli history.  Does that make a difference?  Yes, because we now are misled into thinking that Israel is somehow the result of a crime, or is engaged in criminal activity just by existing, or as a minimum is illegally occupying someone else's country.  That might justify, or at least explain, a very strong response by the people Israel has Wronged.<br /><br />Once we get into the details of Israeli crimes, it gets worse.  Logic dictates that Israel as a nation wants to minimize civilian deaths in this war.  Arab civilian deaths are known to be bad militarily, morally, and from a media standpoint.  So we should suspect that many accounts of willful Israeli killings of civilians are dubious.  This book does not seem to follow this simple logic.  Instead, we are treated to a description of the death of Muhammed al-Dura that implies that it is likely that Israelis killed this boy on purpose.  In fact, it is very unlikely that Israelis killed him at all.  The entire incident may well have been staged.  We don't read anything about that in this book!  Now, what were we just saying about media manipulation?<br /><br />If the rest of the incidents are reported as accurately as the al-Dura one, the entire book is simply fraudulent.  But there is a deeper problem.  We want to know just why there are deaths in this war.  The reason is that the Arab side chose to attack.  Without this aggression, there would be no deaths on either side.  And the book, by not making this clear, is simply Arab propaganda.<br /><br />An interesting and relevant question is whether Israel is using excessive force in responding to murderous attacks on its civilians.  Excessive force is not good for either side.  We need to realize that using too little force is also bad, in that it produces more attacks and more responses, some of which may be excessive as a result.  Anyway, the verdict of this book is that Israel has been going too far.  And that Israel bears some responsibility for this as a nation.  I do wonder just what recommendations these folks would give their own nations were they under attack.<br /><br />It is hard for me to imagine Israel doing more to limit civilian casualties than it did in Jenin.  If that is not good enough for these reporters, then these reporters are opposing human rights, not supporting them.  Eventually, nations will probably defend themselves, whether others approve or not.  Israel is no exception.  If Israel is not going to be granted a right to defend itself, then the concept of a \\"right to defend oneself\\" will no longer have any meaning.<br /><br />But I almost forgot the best part!  There is Balance in this book.  After 140 pages of extremely misleading material condemning Israel, we have 60 pages of criticism of the Arabs!  Yes, some individual Arabs have committed crimes.  Many are listed explicitly.  These include suicide bombings.  But there is more.  Some \\"collaborators\\" have been murdered.  The Arabs have not prosecuted and convicted people for such crimes.  In fact, some Arab courts have passed dubious sentences of death on collaborators themselves.  The Arab justice system is imperfect!  On top of that, free expression is limited in Arafat's territory, and even freedom of the press could be improved.<br /><br />Still, the book implies that any responsibility for such problems is individual.  A few terrorist groups are out of line.  Even an administration may have some corruption and mismanagement.  But there is no hint that there may be something wrong with the whole idea of pressuring Israel into ceding land.  And there is little hint that the whole purpose of the Arab aggression may be to attack Jewish rights of life, liberty, and property in the region.<br /><br />A serious discussion of attacks on human rights and media manipulation ought to include the pervasive antisemitic incitement in Arab media and schools.  It should recognize the contamination of the Arab and international media by arbitrary antizionist untruths.  And it needs to identify the aggressors.  It sure isn't the Israeli side that wants a war that could destroy it.to attack Jewish rights of life, liberty, and property in the region.

It was written in 1988, but I have the updated edition from 1995.<br /><br />Blacks and Jews are minorities that cooperated during the civil rights struggles of the early 1960s.  And there is still some cooperation on that issue, as various states continue to discriminate against minority voters.<br /><br />We see some of the cooperation and also some of the problems as this book as the experiences of six different people are examined in detail.<br /><br />Paul Parks, a Black who joined the civil rights movement in the 1960s, in chosen as an example of one who valued a Black-Jewish alliance.  In April 1945, he was one of the soldiers who liberated the concentration camp at Dachau.  But in 1967, he noted that there were complaints by some Blacks about Jewish landlords in the ghettos.  Parks wanted to distinguish between the slumlords and those Whites who were actively helping the Blacks, given that without White support, Black causes would be hurt.  But we see how many of the more politically involved Blacks thought of the Jews not as another minority but as part of the White majority.<br /><br />Next, we see Jack Greenberg and Esther Brown, who filed a landmark suit against segregated schools (Brown versus the Board of Education).  These were Jews who saw the issue \\"not as a Negro cause but as a human cause.\\"  Still, there were problems when some Blacks decided to boycott a class that Greenberg taught at Harvard on \\"Race and the Law\\" to protest the fact that the instructor was not Black.<br /><br />After that, there is the story of Rhody McCoy, a Black who became the head of the Ocean Hills-Brownsville school district in New York City.  Right away, there was a problem with a teacher strike.  McCoy kept the schools open by hiring sustitute teachers, but this soured relations with the strikers.  The issue became bigger, bitter, and painful, and certainly reduced cooperation among Blacks and Jews in the city.<br /><br />The story Kaufman tells next is of Roz Ebstein and her family.  Hers was just one of many Jewish families in Chicago that supported the civil rights movement in the 1960s.  But we discover the effects of blockbusting, as her neighborhood, rather than becoming integrated, simply became almost exclusively Black.  Eventually, she and her family felt forced to move to a new neighborhood, a few miles away, in order to be in a better school district and to avoid harrassment from Blacks.<br /><br />There is an excellent section about Martin Peretz, who became the editor of The New Republic in 1974.  Right away, we see one effect of Black-Jewish cooperation, namely that some Jews who learned more about Black culture and history decided they might as well learn about Jewish culture and history as well.  Peretz, a liberal, couldn't stand Begin, a conservative Israeli Prime Minister.  But Peretz made a point of supporting Israel's right to exist in the New Republic.  Peretz, a stong supporter of civil rights, raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the civil rights movement.  But a turning point came in 1967, with the National Convention on New Politics.  This group became dominated by radicals who tended to ignore problems of poverty, oppression, the war in Vietnam, racism, and discrimination and instead attacked Zionism.  Peretz was more cautious about which groups he supported after that.<br /><br />The final chapter is about Donna Brazile, a well-known political campaign chairwoman. We see her introduction to issues that were separating Blacks and Jews: Jewish landlords, failure of some Jews to support affirmative action, and failure of some Blacks to support Israel.  Plus, some specific problems, such as the firing of Andrew Young as UN ambassador and Black Presidential candidate Jesse Jackson meeting with terrorist leader Yasser Arafat.  Through all this, Brazile kept her focus on trying to get as diverse and inclusive group of supporters as possiblein her campaigns.<br /><br />I was struck by the mention of Alice Walker, who wrote \\"The Color Purple.\\"  Walker is well-known as a sensitive and thoughtful person.  The book tells that when asked about Farrakhan, she condemned him as a bigot and an antisemite.  But the book also tells of Walker's attitude about Israel, and this shocked me.  I'm not asking that she favor some minority, whether it be Blacks, Jews, Pagans, or anyone else.  But I am asking someone with her credentials to support human rights against aggressive and lying tyrants, thugs, and bullies.  I feel that Walker should have found some way to oppose antizionism very strongly, and I certainly condemn her for not doing so.<br /><br />I think the issue of cooperation among minorities is important.  There is a tendency for minorities, often in an effort to win favor with the majority, to show hostility to other minorities.  That is not the true path.<br /><br />I recommend this book.e Walker, who wrote \\"The Color Purple.\\"  Walker is well-known as a sensitive and thoughtful person.

It starts with a mention of a cartoon in February 1993 by Art Spiegelman, the creator of \\"Maus,\\" showing a Valentine's Day kiss.  This cartoon originally ran on the cover of the New Yorker.  The kiss, which is also on the cover of the book, shows a Hasidic Jew and a glamorous dark-skinned lady.  Now, do I think it is racist for folks to be upset about that cartoon?  Of course.<br /><br />As we see in this book, both Blacks and Jews are minorities.  But both are also majorities, as most Jews are Whites while most Blacks are part of the non-Jewish monotheist majority.<br /><br />Paul Berman's essay brings up some issues, including opposition to South African racism, support for Israel, and support for affirmative action.  These may explain some of the friction between some Blacks and some Jews.  But the solution, in my opinion, is for both to fight oppression.  I can see that even the most reasonable Blacks and Jews will feel uncomfortable if the focus of such attacks is, say, Meir Kahane or Louis Farrakhan.  That's the time to focus on, say, David Duke explicitly and Kahane or Farrakhan only implicitly.<br /><br />On issues of affirmative action, I think the place for cooperation is on educational support for the underprivileged.  It is counterproductive to try for cooperation to lower academic standards.  I think Berman did a good job in showing Jewish concerns about anti-Jewish quotas in universities.<br /><br />Still, I think Berman could have done better when discussing South Africa or Israel.  It is reasonable to ask both Blacks and Jews to oppose White South African racism against Blacks.  It is outrageous to ask either Blacks or Jews to support White South African racism against Blacks.  Similarly, it is reasonable to ask both Blacks and Jews to oppose racist Arab terrorism against Jews.  It is outrageous to ask either Blacks or Jews to support racist Arab terrorism against Jews.  Although I am suspicious of many analogies which make two sides look the same, I think Berman could have said this.<br /><br />Good and bad analogies are a major theme in many of the essays.  James Baldwin compares the riots in Watts and Harlem with the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto.  But I think that no matter what the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto did or didn't do, the analogy is horrible: those in the Ghetto were marked for extermination.<br /><br />On the other hand, Baldwin does make the point that \\"one wrong doesn't make a right, either.\\"  As he says, we love to tell people that we have wronged that two wrongs do not make a right, but people who have been wronged have to be expected to right that wrong.  And I think this is excellent advice that we ought to consider this when we try to be peacemakers in the Middle East.<br /><br />Baldwin is superb in discussing the baffling arbitrariness of racism.  And he asks why one ought to blame Jews for not having been ennobled by oppression.  Baldwin was oppressed but he says \\"that oppression did not ennoble me.\\"<br /><br />Cynthia Ozick deals with the question of riots in Crown Heights.  She points out that we ought not strive to see a false symmetry in the riots.  The Hasidic Jews and Blacks behaved differently in them.  Just as we see very few incidents of the Amish lynching Presbyterians or Methodists, we see very few incidents of mob violence by Hasidic Jews.  And she reminds us that \\"the opposite of war is not love, and certainly not lovemaking.  It is living in peace.\\"<br /><br />The nineteen essays in the book are all worth reading.  I certainly recommend the book.spicious of many analogies which make two sides look the same, I think Berman could have said this.    Good and bad analogies are a major theme in many of the essays.

And this book does a good job of that.<br /><br />As the author says, \\"the Jews have had it better than the Blacks in America, in no small part because of the historical advantage derived from the biological accident of white skin.\\"  Well, lighter skin.  However, \\"if the Nation of Islam - in junior partnership with white racist antisemites - does somehow transform the U. S. into a country where Black-Jewish cooperation towards goals of minority rights and social justice becomes impossible,\\" Jews and Blacks will both suffer.<br /><br />The author says that \\"those who lie to us about the past foreclose our chance to shape the future.\\"<br /><br />There are numerous untruths in \\"The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews.\\"  Brackman exposes many of them in this book.  The untruths include claims that Jews \\"dominated\\" the slave trade in Medieval Europe, Africa, Latin America, and New England.  In fact, Jews played a minor role in all these locations, while Arabs seem to have been the biggest slave traders in Africa.  \\"According to the African historian J. E. Inikori, Arab slavers between the years 650 and 1900 drained Black Africa of 14.4 million people - more than most estimates of slave exports to the Americas during the 400 years of the Atlantic slave trade.\\"<br /><br />What about Southern Jews?  Yes, there were some Southern Jewish slaveowners.  In 1830, there were about 225,000 Southern families who owned slaves, including 322 Jewish families.  About 59,000 of the families owned twenty or more slaves, including 23 Jewish ones.  About 11,000 of the families owned fifty or more slaves including 4 Jewish ones.  By the way, the author points out that some \\"persons of color\\" owned slaves too.  These colored slaveowners \\"outnumbered the Jewish ones by fifteen to one.\\"<br /><br />I want all humans to be happy and prosperous, not poor and miserable.

Are they fighting for human rights together?  Or are some of them bailing out on support for human rights, at least on some issues, as if they have forgotten that oppression is bad?  Michael Lerner and Cornel West explore some of these issues.<br /><br />One question is, of course, justice, and that includes high-publicity trials for violent crimes.  I have noticed that many Whites are willing to strongly denounce the outcomes of the Rodney King and Latasha Harlins cases.  It seems to me that fewer Blacks are as willing to denounce the outcomes of the Nicole Simpson/Ron Goldman and Yankel Rosenbaum trials.  I was hoping this book would have, as a minimum, both authors advocate that both sides do better here.  There will occasionally be some outrageous outcomes of court cases.  We have to accept that.  But I think we have to speak out in favor of truth and justice and do it loudly.  And I think this book is far from satisfactory in that regard.<br /><br />On another topic, here is an amazing quote from Lerner:<br /><br />\\"I don't underestimate the pernicious effect on Jewish consciousness of Commentary Magazine and The New Republic, each of which has given a certain intellectual legitimacy to racist tendencies in the Jewish world, most importantly the deep desire to imagine that Jews have no serious moral or political stake in ending the economic oppression of Blacks.  But these are nevertheless not people who in any overt and conscious way say that Blacks are an evil force in the world.\\"<br /><br />Wow.  It is true that there are a few Blacks who do insist that Jews are an evil force in the world.  But why contrast them with Commentary, which is a conservative but non-racist magazine, let alone with The New Republic, which is a liberal magazine that does claim that we all have a serious moral and political stake in ending discrimination against Blacks?<br /><br />There is an interesting discussion of Black nationalism.  And I certainly agree that it is wrong to oppose nationalism simply on the grounds that some nationalists can be racists or bigots.  When people have common interests or problems, it often makes sense for them to form a national group.  There's also a discussion of Jewish nationalism.  Lerner makes the point that the Dreyfus case in France was a key element in showing the need for Jewish nationalism.<br /><br />Now, what ought one hope for in a book of this sort?  One hope might be that right or wrong, the two authors would agree on how to cooperate.  They would come up with some bad ideas, but the good part would be that they agreed!  Another hope could be that they would come up with good ideas.  I think they came closer to the former than the latter.agree that it is wrong to oppose nationalism simply on the grounds that some nationalists can be racists or bigots.

And there will be revolutionaries in the future.  What impresses me about many of them is the arbitrariness of their causes.  That's the feeling I have about this book in particular.<br /><br />Can left-wingers fight against human rights?  Can they be colonialists?  Albert Memmi, in his book, \\"Portrait du Colonise,\\" says they can.  And the author quotes Memmi here, and agrees with him.  However, Warschawski portrays Memmi and his fellow Zionists as the colonialists!<br /><br />I guess I can play this game as well, and say that the author is a colonialist.  But I'm not sure what the author means by that word.  In any case, I think the author is trying to protect the world from human rights.  He dismisses Jewish attempts to protect their rights to life, liberty, and property as \\"tribalism.\\"  However, these rights are actually universal, not tribal.  These rights ought to apply to all humans in a colorblind world.<br /><br />We're told that the author is for \\"peace.\\"  But enshrining the tyranny his sort of peace would mean is more than a little frightening.<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln once said that those who deny rights to others do not deserve those rights for themselves.  But I don't want to deny rights to anyone.  I simply want to get people to argue for equal rights for everyone.  And I want them to insist on the same rights for themselves as for everyone else, not more and not less.	2005-03-18

Well, it could be partly due to all the incitement against Jews having rights in the Middle East.  It could be in part due to all the antizionist propaganda, and to the support for such propaganda at the UN, in the European Union, among the Arabs, and in much of the international media.  It could be plenty of things.  It could be in part due to insisting on blaming the wrong party much of the time.<br /><br />That's why this book, which does have quite a few facts in it, seems to be less than what one would hope it to be.<br /><br />There are a couple of places where the author had a chance to make a statement that would help put blame where it belongs and thus promote peace.  At one point, Rabinovich quotes some folks who blamed Israel for the collapse of the 2000 Camp David \\"peace\\" talks.  According to the quote, the Arabs \\"were more resigned to the two-state solution than they were willing to embrace it; they were willing to accept Israel's existence but not its moral legitimacy.\\"<br /><br />Well, this is just the place to say something strong against some extremist attitudes.  Aggression is a crime.  Obviously, to get it to stop, it will not suffice to convince a criminal that he or she ought not attack one particular victim for a little while and ought to concentrate on others instead!  If it is legitimate for any human to exist, it is legitimate for Israelis and Israel to exist.  If there is a complaint with some Israelis or with some Israeli action, those individuals and particular actions need to be questioned, not the right of humans to exist in general.<br /><br />Agreement on moral legitimacy is a key and essential element of peace.<br /><br />Moreover, I think we need to ask ourselves about the wisdom of a \\"two-state\\" solution that everyone wants except the combatants.  Israel is small.  It is land-poor.  Why should it be forced to cede land?  Shouldn't it be forced to buy it instead?  Why should we force another Arab state on the world, one whose only purpose is to attack a neighboring state?  If people want to live together, we ought to allow it.  If not, we ought to help draw a border between them, not maliciously decide how much land to steal from an already land-poor minority.  A minority that will be banned from living on the wrong side of the border!<br /><br />But the author let all this pass, not seeming to realize that an insistence on having a right to slander, rob, ban, evict, and kill Jews is unacceptable, whether that \\"right\\" is enforceable or not.  A \\"colorblind\\" approach to the problem was needed, where people would have rights no matter who they were.  But that was unthinkable to the peacemakers as well as to the author.<br /><br />Rabinovich had another chance to try to make a case to me.  After all, I am a liberal and I am very open-minded.  He did say that Ephraim Karsh, a noted historian, had said that accepting Arafat as a peace partner was \\"the single gravest strategic error committed by an Israeli government since the establishment of the state.\\"  The author disagrees.  I suspect that Karsh is correct.  Still, Rabinovich had a chance to make a case against Karsh.  And I found the author quite unconvincing.<br /><br />Read something else.

Let's hear it for Rosaly Lopes, Tracy Gregg, Katherine Cashman, Ellen Stofan, Lisa Gaddis, Susan Sakimoto, Joy Crisp, Louise Prockter, Mary Chapman, Gudrun Larsen, and Susan Kieffer!  These ladies were the logical authorities to be chosen to write their respective chapters.  And they did a great job.<br /><br />Cashman leads off with a discussion of hot spot volcanism and subduction zone volcanism.  The part on hot spots deals mostly with volcanoes in Hawaii, but the Laki volcano in Iceland is chosen as the most dramatic example of \\"the deleterious effects of volcanic gases.\\"  The section on subduction zone volcanism includes topics such as silicic lava flows and lava domes as well as caldera collapse.  And there's plenty about the hazards associated with such volcanism, including a speculation that the eruption of Toba, Sumatra (74,000 years ago) may have reduced the human population to less than 100,000 back then.<br /><br />Gregg talks about the exploration of volcanoes hidden at the sea floor on mid-ocean ridges.  This includes some discussion of hydrothermal venting there, which can raise the ocean water temperature near a vent to over 400 degrees Celsius.  And, of course, it is mentioned that there is speculation about similar volcanism (and even life) on the Jovian moon Europa.<br /><br />What about \\"Earth's evil twin,\\" as Stofan appropriately calls Venus?  Thousands of volcanoes have been identified on Venus.  We learn about lava flows there as well as long sinuous channels.  Some of the lava flows there are much longer than were predicted.  Hopefully, we'll learn from them how to better predict how far lava flows will travel on our own planet!<br /><br />Gaddis tells us about lunar volcanoes.  She shows a picture of a sinuous rille on the Moon.  A few decades ago, some people speculated that such rilles were produced by water, but Gaddis explains that they are now known to have been carved by lava.  And she says that volcanoes on the Moon range from about 4.3 billion years old (since the formation of the lunar crust) to 3 billion years old.  There hasn't been any volcanic activity on the moon in the past billion years or so.<br /><br />Sakamoto and Crisp then have sections on Martian volcanoes.  Besides an overview, we get a detailed discussion of what Mars Pathfinder discovered from the Martian surface.<br /><br />Lopes (who is almost literally the girl from Ipanema) has a fascinating section on the Io volcanoes observed by the Voyager and Galileo missions.  She is now working on the Cassini Mission, where she is getting a chance to investigate calderas and cryovolcanism on Titan.  I think we'll need a new edition to tell us about this!<br /><br />Procter's section is on ice volcanism.  She shows us evidence of cryoclastic eruptions on Europa and on other moons of major planets.  The most interesting part is the discussion of the \\"cantaloupe terrain\\" of Triton.<br /><br />Well, what do volcanoes produce? Um, ash!  And Chapman and Larsen tell us plenty about it.  Larsen is an expert in tephrachronology, and she knows all about the varied ages and types of ash deposits in Iceland.  This detailed knowledge is used by the authors to draw conclusions about volcanic deposits on Mars (Chapman's specialty).<br /><br />The book concludes with a chapter by Kieffer.  She begins with the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park.  She contrasts these geyser eruptions with volcanic plumes on Mars, Io, and Mount Saint Helens.  And from here, she makes analogies with volcanism on Triton and Titan.<br /><br />Volcanoes are very interesting.  But one can see that it takes hard work and talent to do work in this field.  In my opinion, there is one other requirement, namely courage.  Volcanoes are dangerous!  In any case, let me express my sincere admiration forall the authors in producing this fine book.	2005-03-16

S. Champion, a World Junior Champion, and twice a Candidate for the World Championship.  And this is a very good book for beginners on chess openings.<br /><br />We start by looking at some games played by complete beginners.  That includes starting with h4 so that you can play Rh3.  It includes some silly Queen raids, such as 1 e4 e5 2 Qh5 g6 3 Qxe5+ Qe7 4 Qxh8.  And it explains that such raids do not work if your opponent pays attention to your threats.  And then there is a discussion of the Legal mate, after which we get to a brief discussion of the ideas behind most of the common openings.<br /><br />The section on the openings and the ideas behind them takes up 166 pages, well over half the book.  I think it is just what a beginner can use.  And the book finishes with a suggestion for a beginner's repertoire: the King's Indian attack, the King's Indian defence, and the Pirc defence.  Now, some folks like these openings and some do not.  But what impressed me was Seirawan's clear explanations to beginners about how to play them.<br /><br />I was surprised to see the discussion of beginner's games.  But I think it is a good idea!  Matter of fact, I would have included just one more chapter, showing just one step beyond the Queen raids, where White plays for a cheap but deadly attack.  Here are two examples, but of course there are many others:<br /><br />1 Nc3 e5 2 e4 (this is the Vienna Game) 2...Nf6 3 f4 exf4 (a famous beginner's error!) 4 e5 Qe7 5 Qe2 Ng8 6 Nf3 Nc6 7 d4 f6? 8 Nd5 Qd8 9 exf6+ Nge7 10 Ng5 (Black can't stop checkmate here).<br /><br />1 Nc3 d5 2 d4 Nf6 3 e4 dxe4 4 f3 (this is the Blackmar Gambit) 4...exf3 5 Qxf3 Qxd4 6 Be3 Qb4 7 0-0 Bg5 (a very famous beginner's error) 8 Nb5 Qa5 9 Qxb7 (White is winning easily).<br /><br />I think a couple of examples such as these would drive home the point that one has to know the most famous two or three tricks that folks have in mind with some of these openings.  Otherwise, one is bound to get in trouble the first couple of times one faces them.<br /><br />I think I might also give an example of how easy it is to get into trouble even against a silly opening.  Something like this:<br /><br />1 Nc3 c5 2 Rb1 (you can't get much sillier than this!) Nf6 3 g3 d5 4 Bg2 e5 5 e4 Be6 (just one careless move and it can all fall apart) 6 exd5 Nxd5 7 Qf3 Nxc3 8 bxc3 Nc6 9 Rxb7 (the total triumph of evil over good) Rc8 10 Qxc6 (Black can resign now).<br /><br />Anyway, I think this is a superb book, even without the sort of additional material I was hoping to see.Otherwise, one is bound to get in trouble the first couple of times one faces them. <br /> <br />I think I might also give an example of how easy it is to get into trouble even against a silly opening.

Books	1	5	12	N	N	Has little to do with reality	I looked hard for something in this book that I could praise.  I didn't find anything.<br /><br />Now, someone could say that the Jews in Israel are outnumbered by folks who want to remove their rights, steal their land, and kill them.  And whether this is true or false, they could then make some recommendations to both sides.  They could tell the Jews to flee, to sell their land, to find new allies, to get old allies to help, to fight, to convert, to roll over and die, to ally themselves with their enemies, or whatever.  And they could tell the Arabs that Israel is a small country with few resources, and that smashing it is a big crime.<br /><br />This book does nothing of the sort.  Instead, it seems to make the absurd and false point that Israel is by nature unable to exist honestly, and ought to give away its excess land!<br /><br />Now, let's reason together.  I think the Arabs who are attacking Israel are not a nation.  For the sake of argument, let us say that I am right or wrong.  We will look at both cases.  Let us imagine that there is to be peace, and let us see what happens to poor little Israel if peace and justice should prevail.<br /><br />Well, if the Arabs of the region are not really a nation, they may have plenty of kids.  But when Jews and Arabs buy and sell homes in the region, Jews will be willing to pay far more than Arabs.  No matter how many kids the Arabs have, the Jews will win the demographic battle.  Even if there are hundreds of millions of Arabs, they will simply buy elsewhere, and the Jews will remain a majority in Israel.  After all, there are already over five million Jews in Israel.  There are even more in the Diaspora, many of whom may regard Israel as more attractive than ever if there is peace there.  And Jews have at least as much money per capita as the average.  They'll easily buy up much of the ten thousand square miles in the region.  Maybe more.<br /><br />So there is no demographic reason for the Jews to give up trying to live in Asia.  Perhaps there is a military reason.<br /><br />Oh, but wait!  What if I am wrong?  What if the \\"whole world\\" is right?  What if there really is a special Arab people, millions strong, who simply must live in Israel, and nowhere else?  And what if God Herself has so decreed it?<br /><br />First, if that is the case, Israel will get pretty crowded.  I wonder if there will be enough water?  Luckily, the Jews of Israel have increased water productivity in that nation to a rather high level.  So maybe there will be enough water.  But I can't guarantee that life will be inexpensive there.<br /><br />Now, let's look at the way homes will be sold if the special Arabs really will pay more than the Jews.  The Jews will indeed get bought out from Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Eilat, and the rest of Israel.  But only if they get a huge amount of money, and only if they can be sure that this money is genuine and can be used to buy houses elsewhere.  They will try to use that money to buy homes from Arabs elsewhere in Israel, but now they'll be outbid for these homes.  Therefore, the Jews will simply buy all of Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria with the money.  That sounds like a fair trade, don't you think?<br /><br />My point is simple.  There is no \\"demographic problem\\" that restricts the size of Israel to less than 9000 square miles. Arabs can not shame or cajole five million or more Jews into vanishing.  Getting rid of Israeli Jewish rights (or getting rid of the Israeli Jews) requires violence.  If there is a problem for the Jews, it is Arab violence.<br /><br />So Wasserstein is wrong.<br /><br />He asks how many Jews lived in Israel 100 years ago.  And we ought to know the answer.  But it is irrelevant to his argument and to mine.  He says that Arabs are having more kids.  But unless they are happy to live in Israel and able to afford it, that's also irrelevant to his argument and to mine.  He asks if the region was really partitioned after World War One (prior toa huge percentage of the world's Jews being killed in World War Two).  Um, that is really irrelevant now.<br /><br />As I see it, this book simply asks how much land we ought to steal from the land-poor Asian Jews.  And it comes up with a wrong answer.  See if you can guess the right answer!really irrelevant now.      As I see it, this book simply asks how much land we ought to steal from the land-poor Asian Jews.

Just whose land is it?<br /><br />Well, there is an experiment that could be done to discover the answer.  Suppose we let the people who live there now (including renters) be declared owners of what they live on.  And suppose we then make sure that there is peace in the region.  And suppose we then make sure that all humans on this planet have a right to buy any land in the region that happens to be for sale.  High bidder gets to buy!  Just what would happen then?<br /><br />I know what I think would happen.  I think Jews would get some land.  Arabs would get some land.  Others would get some land.  There would be plebescites and new borders.<br /><br />There are over five million Jews in the Holy Land right now.  If anything, I think that number would increase in peacetime.  You are as free to guess as I am just how many square miles of land would be awarded to a Jewish state after a few years of purchases and a plebescite.<br /><br />Drummond does not consider this.  Instead, she warns us that Israel is too big!  After all, Arabs are having plenty of kids.<br /><br />Well, Eastern Asians are having plenty of kids too.  Does that mean that the Netherlands is too big?  I think Drummond is missing the fact that Israel and the Netherlands are both land-poor.  On top of that, a fair amount of Israel is desert land.<br /><br />I read the new edition (2004) of this book.  And the index is messed up somewhat.  Drummond ought to have checked the new page numbers better.  But this is the least of my problems with the book.<br /><br />Drummond starts right out by saying that the Holy Land is holy for \\"the world's three monotheistic faiths.\\"  She has a way with words!  I'll accept \\"Holy Land\\" as opposed to some other term.  And I'll even accept the word \\"faiths.\\"  But even these are at least mildly biased words.  Still, surely there are more than three monotheistic religions.  And there are more than three which consider the area holy.  Even Drummond admits that there is a Baha'i religion.  She ought to have mentioned the Baha'i Temple in Haifa, too!<br /><br />As for Polytheistic faiths, well, obviously the author does not care about mere Gods and Goddesses.  Otherwise I think she would have mentioned the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva that used to be where the Dome of the Rock now is.<br /><br />Drummond calls the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan, and even the eastern part of Jerusalem \\"occupied territory.\\"  Actually, it is disputed territory.  Jerusalem was the Jewish capital for a very long time.  The entire city was supposed to be internationalized in 1948, but only for ten years.  It was intended that in 1958, a plebescite would be held.  Jerusalem would then have gone to the majority.  Considering that the Jews have been over 60% of the population of the city for most of the past century, calling the eastern part \\"occupied\\" is especially outrageous.<br /><br />The author admits that Israel does not agree with her about Jerusalem.  But she does not say why, and she implies that Israel is clearly wrong here.<br /><br />Does Drummond let her obvious bias affect her statements of what ought to be facts?  Yes.  One example is her claim that before World War Two, militant Zionists wanted the Arabs out of the Promised Land and made no secret of it.  That is false.<br /><br />Still, Drummond is even worse when she gets to interpret events.  To her credit, she does cite the fact that over 800,000 Jews from Arab lands were expelled from, fled from, or simply left in the past century.  But her interpretation is to blame Israel entirely for this.  Others have pointed out that Arab pogroms against the Jews in these lands tended to start as a result of Arab independence there, prior to the existence of Israel.  Drummond does not consider this.<br /><br />Drummond also calls Arafat a \\"world statesman.\\"  No matter what she calls him, he was always a thug.  And no matter what I say about her book, it will still have the same faults.her book, it will still have the same faults.	2005-03-14

And where each person has equal rights.<br /><br />That surely does not mean lowering standards.  A doctor still has to meet standards to practice.  A university student still has to pass exams to qualify for a profession.<br /><br />But it does mean letting people into that university independent of their race, religion, gender, sexual preference, creed, and so on.  Maybe age discrimination would be an interesting question, but discrimination in favor of or against people of a specific skin color?  That's supposed to be illiberal.<br /><br />A century ago, the bar was set higher for non-whites than for whites.  That was racist and counterproductive.  Jim Sleeper asks if we are setting the bar so low for non-whites today that we are denying non-whites the satisfaction of equal accomplishment and opportunity.  Given my Asian background, I find this question interesting.<br /><br />Sleeper asks if, not out of malice but out of folly, many liberals have overemphasized black identity and thus behaved in a racist manner themselves.  The author explains that conservatives still have some of the same exclusionary problems they've always had.  This is not an apology for conservatism.  It is a plea for genuine liberalism.<br /><br />As Sleeper explains, blacks have much to profit from a truly color-blind society.<br /><br />The first main topic Sleeper deals with is individual responsibility, as seen in court cases.  In the past, blacks simply did not get treated justly in white courts.  But there is still a threat of some of the same problems if we keep looking carefully at skin color in court cases.  What is legal for whites must be legal for blacks and what is illegal for whites has to be illegal for blacks.  The author gives some examples in which many liberals have strayed from this idea.<br /><br />The next issue is voting rights, where the threat by those who simply will not be color-blind is racial districting.  After that, Sleeper discusses the media.  He tells us that \\"good journalists are not crusaders or missionaries.  Their job is to uncover the truth, even when it hurts.\\"  He contrasts the coverage of a 35,000 person Promise Keepers rally to the 400,000 person Farrakhan \\"March.\\"  Both of these events could have been treated sympathetically, fairly, or critically.  But they were treated very differently.<br /><br />I wanted to see a more thorough discussion of affirmative action.  I think there ought to be a clear and beneficial policy here.  Namely this: everyone needs to meet the same standards to serve the community, independent of race.  But those who are having trouble meeting standards should get some extra support.  That is help so that they can meet standards, not a lowering of standards that renders those with credentials suspect.  Giving some students extra help in high school makes sense.  Kids are required to go to high school by law.  Letting people into college who do not actually qualify seems counterproductive to me.  But this is not a major criticism of the book.  The author has shown that some of us have been lowering standards on the basis of race, and that's the main issue here.<br /><br />I think Sleeper has made some valuable points.  Liberal racism may be more patronizing than malicious, but it is part of a problem in our society.  We'll all be more prosperous and happier if we can have a colorblind attitude and reduce racial divisions rather than enhance them.ights, where the threat by those who simply will not be color-blind is racial districting.

I am a liberal and I say yes!<br /><br />I do not discriminate and base my answer on your race, religion, or native language.<br /><br />When two groups appear to be fighting over the same land, there could be many things going on.  One possibility is that it is a genuine dispute over land.  In that case, both sides will be trying to figure out what to do about land that they both have a claim to.  They will tend to argue in favor of their own rights.  Not against the rights of others.  And they will be coming up with compromises: one side buying out the other, splitting the land, one or both sides moving a short ways, buying more land from others and splitting that, and so forth.  The ideas will be productive.  That is what real groups at least consider when they actually both have claims to land.<br /><br />Another possibility is that one side is being a bully.  It could care less about land.  What it wants is power.  It wants to establish itself as important and other people as trash.  So it finds out what land is most strongly claimed by some other group and then walks over to it and tells the people there to get out.  There's no real negotiation.  Both sides know whose land it really is.  There is only one question: Are humans trash?<br /><br />Needless to say, there are other possibilities as well.  But my point is that there is an enormous difference between these two scenarios.<br /><br />For many centuries, Jews have wanted to buy Levantine land.  In the 19th century, they started having serious opportunities to buy land.  They wanted the land more than others, so they bought.  At high prices.  They even came up with a new nation, simply to defend their rights of life, liberty, property, and immigration.  Now some bullies are saying that this land must be given to the bullies.<br /><br />And this book, no matter what its intention, is simply helping folks side with the bullies.  The bullies are Arab extremists who surely are not doing most Arabs any favors.<br /><br />If anything, the author implies that it is the Jews who are the bullies.  Misidentifying the bad guys is seriously counterproductive if you want peace!<br /><br />According to Rodgers, the Jews \\"may have been a people without a land.  But if there was a land without people,\\" it surely wasn't the Levant.<br /><br />No kidding.  Does he expect me to claim that there were no people in Asia in the 19th century as well?  This was never the claim made by the Zionists.  The claim was that the Levant was a land without a people.  And that was correct.  There's one there now, of course, namely the Israelis.<br /><br />Similarly, Latvia is a land with one people, namely the Latvians.  The Russians are a people too.  The Arabs are a people too.  But they have their own lands.  Latvia and Israel are not central to them.<br /><br />Rodgers makes fun of Golda Meir for saying pretty much what I just wrote.  But Meir was right, while Rodgers is wrong.  And it does make a big difference.<br /><br />The author seems to blame the survival of the Zionists in 1948 and 1967 on racist acts of religious fanatics.  That may be an exaggeration on his part (and on my part).  But I think the point is that humans need neither a justification nor an excuse for defending their lives, liberty, and property.<br /><br />What ought Israel to do?  I don't know.

That is, climate is what you expect.

Then he discusses wine harvest data from France.  Next is the rate of withdrawal of the Rhone glacier.  Detailed data are in the Appendix.<br /><br />There are discussions of atypical years.  One that he spends some time on is 1816.  The spring was cooler than normal.  June was cold.  The temperatures in Paris in June, 1816 were 3.5 degrees Celsius lower than normal.  And the ensuing winter was deadly.  In the original edition of this book (1971), Ladurie, to my surprise, did not mention the cause of all this, namely the major eruption of the Tambora volcano in 1815.  In the Afterword, written in 1982, he finally mentions it.<br /><br />Well, in a nutshell, what can we conclude about, um, worldwide climate?  It was relatively cold from 500 BC to 100 BC.

But it isn't all that good.  And the author's conclusions are dubious at best.<br /><br />Suppose we were to see a history of Vilnius.  We'd discover that the capital of Lithuania could be claimed by Russia, Belorus, or even Poland.  Of course, these places have their own capitals.  But why not steal someone else's?  We could make up a story that some Russian Czar once dreamed of Vilnius.  That ought to give folks a right to swipe it!<br /><br />And there is a demographic argument!  Lithuania doesn't have as many people as Russia.  Surely, we ought to bow to reality and let Russia have it.  Or at least internationalize it!<br /><br />The problem with the demographic argument is that the Russians have a huge land while the Lithuanians have a small one.  Unless Vilnius is stolen from the Lithuanians by force, the Lithuanians are very likely to keep it.<br /><br />Now, let's see if we can do a little better than Wasserstein, and apply this reasoning to Jerusalem.<br /><br />The author admits that in 1910, there were about 45,000 Jews in Jerusalem as opposed to 12,000 Muslims and 12,900 Christians.  Jerusalem had been the capital of the Jews for millenia, since the time of King David.  And even in the mid-1870s, before Modern Zionism began, Jerualem's Jews were a majority of the population.<br /><br />In 1910, we see that Jews were well over 60% of the population.  They still are.  Unless violence is used to get rid of them, the Jews will keep Jerusalem.<br /><br />Now, it is true that we could make up a story about Mohammed dreaming about Jerusalem.  Hey, we could make up a story about Mohammed's horse being born in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, exactly 600 years to the day after the birth of Jesus.  But would that suffice to justify swiping the Church of the Nativity?<br /><br />I'm a Pagan who would be happy to see the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva restored in Aelia Capitolina.  But I can see who really lives there now.  The Jews do.  And the Muslims are a big minority.  And the Christians have been fleeing the place, but there are still a few left.  There aren't too many Polytheists around.  We don't own the place.  And that is what counts.<br /><br />Wasserstein wants to come up with a politically correct solution that will give Muslims a right to at least share Jerusalem (oops, I mean al-Quds) equally with the Jews, or with the Jews and Christians.  Well, before I consider this, I want to see a politically incorrect proposal to share Medina (oops, I mean Yathrib) equally with the Jews.  Israel is not a large nation.

And he does mention the fact that every candidate for President of the United States in the past few elections has promised to move America's Israeli Embassy to Jerusalem.  None have done so.  This would have been an opportunity for him to advise candidates to carry out that promise or stop making it.  But he didn't really do that.  Instead, he implied that it would somehow be unfair and unwise for the United States, which has all its other embassies in the capitals of nations, to put its Israeli embassy in the capital of Israel.<br /><br />Right now, many Muslims are happy to say that what is theirs is theirs and theirs alone, while what is not theirs is negotiable and must be shared with them or given to them outright.

And the Christians have been fleeing the place, but there are still a few left.  There aren't too many Polytheists around.  We don't own the place.  And that is what counts.    Wasserstein wants to come up with a politically correct solution that will give Muslims a right to at least share Jerusalem (oops, I mean al-Quds) equally with the Jews, or with the Jews and Christians.  Well, before I consider this, I want to see a politically incorrect proposal to share Medina (oops, I mean Yathrib) equally with the Jews.  Israel is not a large nation.

His idea is that Muslims may reject violence as counterproductive and instead achieve the acceptance of their wisdom by convincing us all.  In return for accepting their wisdom, they will accept our advice to be non-violent about it.  As for those who reject the truth of what they have to say, well, they'll simply shame us all into accepting their wisdom.  Did I use the word wisdom a little too much?  If so, it is because I think this book needs more of it.  Much more of it.<br /><br />Kepel never seems to get around to condemning Arab propaganda.  And in an age where the international information supply has been seriously contaminated by arbitrary antizionist untruths, I think this is a serious oversight.<br /><br />First we see Kepel misrepresent the 2000 Intifada as the work of Sharon, who clearly provoked the Arabs by visiting the Temple Mount, and Arafat, who clearly provoked the Jews by killing them in bunches.<br /><br />But this is nonsense.  Jewish members of the Knesset had been visiting the Temple Mount, which is Judaism's holiest site, on a regular basis.  If non-Muslims were to start a war just because an Arab leader visited the Kaaba, we'd all regard this as an absurd excuse.  Kepel just adds to the problem by pretending that this is reasonable.<br /><br />This is a serious problem with the whole book, because truth is central to the theme.  If Muslims are going to support truth, they may get their way without violence.  If they are fighting truth, they will not be able to convince others or shame them into agreeing.  The only options left will be violence or apology.<br /><br />The author is convincing when he says that Israeli settlements do annoy some Arabs.  Now, these settlements are on disputed land.  They ought to be as legal as Arab settlements.  But let's forget all that.  Let us think only of justice and truth and human rights.  Here is where Kepel falls apart.  He keeps implying that in a just world, Israel would be trimmed down to size.  And that even if the settlements are legal, if Israel had to fend for itself, without anyone supporting it or attacking it, the size of Israel would decrease to something more reasonable.<br /><br />Kepel has it totally wrong.  Israel has over 6 million people and over 5 million Jews.  In a just world, all else being equal, Israel would be much bigger.  And this is the core of the problem.  The present size of Israel is not a crime against Nature.  If anything, it is like low tide at the beach: one is making a big mistake if one expects the water to recede from it for the rest of the day.<br /><br />The author admits that some folks support Israel here.  But he blames this support on a few \\"neoconservatives,\\" implying that they are fighting against reality.  The truth is that the Arab side is fighting against justice and reality, and that such a war can't be won in the long run.<br /><br />Once Kepel avoids saying that in a just world, Israel would be much bigger, it is easy for him to present Muslim violence as the wrong means for antizionist Muslims to convince others of their essential reasonableness.  And in his discussion of Europe, he concludes that European Islam will emerge with a \\"universalist perspective, freed from the straitjacket of authoritarianism and corruption.\\"  Now, I do admit that the author is a learned and intelligent person.  And he may be right!  But as far as I am concerned, he could not have made a less convincing case.would be trimmed down to size.

But when it comes to Islamic violence against non-Muslim neighbors, I think his work is way off base.  He says that the Arab-Israeli conflict is \\"the crucible of the conflicts affecting the Muslim ummah.\\"<br /><br />While many Muslims do think about this particular conflict, I think Bonney is entirely wrong here.  Suppose Israel and the Jews were all to disappear overnight.  Would that ease the conflict?  No.  The problem is not with Israel, it is with the jihadists.  Removing Israel will not solve the conflict any more than removing Czechoslovakia would have solved the 1938 problem of National Socialist Germany.<br /><br />The author does present unusual perspectives on some historical events.  He points out that in October, 1939, von Ribbentrop called the failure of the British to establish an Arab state in what is now Israel \\"an example of British perfidy.\\"  Given the promise of the British to the League of Nations to establish a Jewish national home in the Mandate, and therefore to encourage Jewish immigration into the Mandate territory, and given the huge number of Jews who died as a result of the British breaking that promise with the 1939 White Paper, I have to disagree with von Ribbentrop.  I think there was British perfidy in pretty much precluding Jewish immigration.  Bonney ought to have said so.<br /><br />Bonney thinks that Jewish claims to Israel are based on ancient ties to the land and on religious grounds.  Again, he is totally wrong.  These ties did give Jews a big incentive to purchase land and live on it.  But Jewish rights to that land are no different from the property rights of all other human beings.  They bought that land.  It is theirs.  Denying it to them means denying property rights to all humans.  Bonney seems to be unconcerned about the idea of making special international rules that apply to Jews only, or maybe to non-Muslims only.<br /><br />Bonney is willing to defend jihad as the right of defence of the community.  He overlooks the fact that when this defence includes murdering innocent non-Muslims in order to bully them and steal their land, this defence is in and of itself a crime.  And crime does not always pay.he right of defence of the community.

That's why, as a non-math major, I wandered into a very serious analysis class for mathematics majors.  That might have been a disaster for me.  Luckily, we used this book as a text, and it saved me.  I read the whole book and diligently did all the exercises (of course, back then, it was the first edition, with only 227 pages and 140 exercises; it's somewhat more now).  And that is my recommendation today.  Read the book carefully and do as many exercises as you can.  It certainly isn't easy.  But it isn't, um, countably hard either.<br /><br />The material in the book is self-contained.  I guess that in theory, it could be mastered by any bright 14-year old who had learned some high school algebra and geometry.  But I would surely recommend having much more mathematical sophistication than that as a prerequisite!<br /><br />If you haven't learned the language of mathematics before, you'll enjoy the use of terms such as \\"countable,\\" \\"real,\\" \\"rational cuts,\\" \\"measure,\\" \\"ring,\\" and \\"complete.\\" By the end of the book, when the author claims that a proof (involving Cauchy sequences no less) is complete, you'll barely be able to suppress a desire to ask \\"Does every Cauchy sequence in the proof converge?\\"<br /><br />In the first edition of this book, Rudin did mess up a little in his section on \\"the integral as a limit of sums.\\" His theorem as stated was false.  We cruelly dubbed it \\"Rudin's Last Theorem.\\"  Worse, he had used it \\"to prove some elementary properties of the Stieltjes integral.\\"  But that was all straightened out by the second edition.<br /><br />I especially like the first couple of chapters.  They give most readers the confidence to continue.  And the final chapter, on Lebesgue integration, is very well written.  One note of warning, though.  Rudin begins this chapter by saying, \\"Some of the easier propositions are stated without proof.  However the reader who has become familiar with the techniques used in the preceding chapters will certainly find no difficulty in supplying the missing steps.\\"  That is an exaggeration.  It takes work.  After all, this is, um, real mathematics you'll be doing!<br /><br />I'm thankful that I was assigned this as my textbook.certainly find no difficulty in supplying the missing steps.\\"  That is an exaggeration.

If you consider the Budapest sound, then a Budapest with an extra move ought to be playable.  And sometimes White's play against the Budapest does rely on that pawn on c4.  But at other times, the pawn would be better off on c2.  As an example, playing the Tennison, Bb5 for White does not work very well with that Black pawn still on c7.  The book does mention that White can play lines such as 1 Nf3 d5 2 a4 c5 3 e4 to get a true reversed Budapest, and it gives a few lines, but I'm not too excited about that idea.<br /><br />I got this book because I play the Scandinavian as Black, and I was fortunate to win when someone tried 1 e4 d5 2 Nf3 against me.  Reading it, I was impressed by the 1933 Keres-Teltvecker game.  That went 1 Nf3 d5 2 e4 dxe4 3 Ng5 Bf5 4 Nc3 Nf6 5 Bc4 e6 6 f3 exf3 7 Qxf3 c6 8 Nxf7 Kxf7 9 Qxf5 Qe7 10 Ne4 h6 11 Nc5 g6 12 Qxe6+ Ke8 13 0-0 b5 14 Qc8+ Qd8 15 Re1+ Be7 16 Rxe7+ Kxe7 17 Qe6+ Kf8 18 Qf7 mate.  So I tried the Tennison in six games, and won five times.  Twice, I got into this line.  The first time, my opponent played 7...Nc6 8 Nxf7 Nd4 9 Qxf5 exf5 10 Nxd8 Nxc2+ 11 Kd1 Nxa1 12 Nf7 Rg8 13 Re1+ Be7 14 Nb5 and I won easily.  My next opponent tried 6...e3 (Help! It's not in the book!) 7 d3 Be7 8 Qe2 Nd5 9 N5e4 Nf4 10 Qf1 Qd4 11 Ne2 Nxe2 12 Qxe2 Nd7 13 Qxe3 Qxe3+ 14 Bxe3 and I was lucky to win.<br /><br />I wasn't worried about 1 e4 d5 2 Nf3 e6 since I intended to play an Advance Variation of the French.  Against 2...d4, I would have played 3 Bc4.  2...e5 leads to a Queen Pawn Countergambit (or maybe the Elephant gambit) and that is very good for White.  Lutes spends a dozen pages showing what to do about it.<br /><br />One of my games started 1 e4 d5 2 Nf3 dxe4 3 Ng5 e5 4 d3 exd3 5 Bxd3 Be7 6 f4, and what I learned from the book helped me win it.  And I only drew a game which started 1 Nf3 d5 2 e4 dxe4 3 Ng5 Nf6 4 Nc3 Bg4 5 Be2 Bxe2 6 Qxe2 e6? 7 Qb5+, but I can't blame the opening for that.<br /><br />Another game started 1 Nf3 d5 2 e4 dxe4 3 Ng5 f5 4 Bc4 Nh6 5 Nxh7 (the book says 5 d3 is better) Rxh7 (5...g6 is better) 6 Qh5+ Kd7 7 Qg6 Rh8 8 Be6+ Kc6 9 Bxc8+ Qd6 10 Qe8+ Kb6 11 Qa4, and I managed to win.<br /><br />My final game began 1 e4 d5 2 Nf3 dxe4 3 Ng5 Qd5 4 d3 exd3 5 Nc3 Qe5+ 6 Be3 dxc2 Now the book move is 7 Qd5, but over the board, I got suspicious of this line, so I tried the, um, \\"Jill gambit\\" 7 Qd8+ (no, it isn't in the book).  My opponent had been all prepared for 7 Qd5 and my move was a big surprise.  After 7...Kxd8 8 Nxf7+ Ke8 9 Nxe5 Nf6 10 Bd3 e6 11 Nb5 Bd6 12 Nc4, I wound up winning again.<br /><br />That all sounds good.  But after I looked at these games and saw all the chances my opponents had, I decided to give up the Tennison.  It's unsafe chess.  There is no point taking such risks with White.  If you want to try an unusual and offbeat line against the Scandinavian Defence, here's one.  I was swept off the board with Black in this game, and I think White's line is pretty safe to use.  1 e4 d5 2 exd5 Nf6 3 d4 Nxd5 4 c4 Nb6 5 Nc3 (the books do not like this because of Black's reply) 5...e5 6 Nf3 Bg4? (this move does not work: I should have played 6...exd4, but White is safe here) 7 Be2 Bxf3 8 Bxf3 exd4 9 0-0 dxc3 10 Re1+ Be7 11 Bg5 f6 12 Bh5+ g6 13 Bxf6 0-0 14 Bxe7 Qxd1 15 Bxd1 cxb2 16 Rb1 Re8 17 c5! Nc6 18 cxb6 Rxe7 19 Rxe7 Nxe7 20 bxc7 Rc8 21 Rxb2 Rxc7 22 g3 and White eventually won.  Note that Black was almost always playing forced moves and White was never at risk.<br /><br />However, to play this, you need to prepare something against 2...Qxd5 too.  And you need something against the Portuguese Variation (3...Bg4) and maybe even something against the unusual Kiel Variation (4...Nb4).<br /><br />Anyway, if you prefer to play the wild Tennison gambit, and you like the variations you've seen, try this book.  Lutes has plenty of lines and information, as well as some background on the originator of the gambit, Captain Tennison.1 Nf3 d5 2 e4 dxe4 3 Ng5 f5 4 Bc4 Nh6 5 Nxh7 (the book says 5 d3 is better) Rxh7 (5...g6 is better) 6 Qh5+ Kd7 7 Qg6 Rh8 8 Be6+ Kc6 9 Bxc8+ Qd6 10 Qe8+ Kb6 11 Qa4, and I managed to win.

This wonderful book (which includes four beautiful full-color photos of the aurora) describes the experiences of the author, a great auroral scientist, in characterizing and explaining auroral phenomena.<br /><br />Akasofu begins his story in 1860.  In that year, R. C. Carrington observed an intense white light solar flare.  About 16 hours later, a brilliant auroral display appeared over northern Europe and elsewhere.  In the same year, E. Loomis showed that the aurora tends to appear along a fairly narrow belt centered around the northwest tip of Greenland.<br /><br />In 1896, Kristen Birkeland proposed that auroras were caused by \\"cathode rays\\" (electrons) emitted by the Sun and guided towards the Earth's higher latitudes by the Earth's magnetic field.  And in 1931, Sydney Chapman and Vincenzo Ferraro came up with the idea \\"of confinement of the Earth's magnetic field in a cavity carved in the solar gas flow.\\"<br /><br />Akasofu then tells of his own contributions to the field.  In 1958, he went to the University of Alaska to study with Chapman.  He noticed at once that the aurora \\"tends to appear in the northern sky in the evening, advances toward the zenith (or even the southern sky) of Fairbanks (gm lat 64.6 degrees), and recedes towards the northern sky in the morning.\\"  This shift had been well-known for at least two decades (and perhaps many millennia).  But it was a \\"great surprise\\" for Akasofu that the aurora behaved this way in Fort Yukon too.  And at Barrow.  Auroral data from Siberia then led Akasofu to realize \\"that when an auroral arc is quiet in Alaska (in the midnight sky) it is also quiet over Siberia (in the evening sky), and in Canada (in the morning sky).\\"  He then showed that during magnetic disturbances, the auroral ovals expand in area, with the equatorward auroral zone boundary moving to lower latitudes.  From this he evolved the concept of a magnetospheric substorm.  The auroral manifestation of this is the auroral substorm, the basic geomagnetic phenomenon associated with auroral activity.<br /><br />The author covers a variety of topics associated with the aurora.  One is about the Earth's dipole.  Akasofu asks if it is really off-centered and inclined.  Or is there a main dipole which is aligned with respect to the rotation axis and a few other dipoles at the surface of the Earth's core?<br /><br />Another chapter is called the \\"myth of the emerging flux tubes.\\"  Sometimes we see pairs of sunspots.  Flux tubes are one hypothesis that may explain them.  But this is just a hypothesis.  It requires more verification to be more than that.<br /><br />Yet another interesting and useful chapter is on predicting geomagnetic storms from solar observations.<br /><br />The author even suggests exploring for life on extraterrestrial planets by searching for oxygen emissions (the 557.7 nm \\"green line\\") in their aurora.<br /><br />I was intrigued by Akasofu's thoughts about doing science.  Auroral phenomena have plenty of patterns to them.  However, no theory about them can explain all the data.  As in other areas of science, researchers have too often tried to force their data to fit into some existing hypothesis.  Unfortunately, some of the data are counterintuitive and simply don't fit.  Besides, the phenomena are not exactly repeatable.  As Akasofu says, \\"no two substorms are alike.\\"<br /><br />Akasofu tells us that a scientist must choose which observed facts are to be considered essential.  Then one tries to derive a theory which explains these essential facts.  It isn't easy, and one must keep an open mind.  From what I have seen of auroral data, I have to agree.<br /><br />I think all scientists, not just auroral scientists, could profit from reading this book.is the auroral substorm, the basic geomagnetic phenomenon associated with auroral activity.

I find the topics fascinating.  I read all these articles when they first appeared, and they are surprisingly relevant even 25 to 50 years later.<br /><br />The first article, by Basil Mason, is from 1961, on snowflakes.  He shows what kinds of snow crystals exist and describes his experiments to grow artificial snowflakes on filaments.  Of course, plenty of work has been done on this topic since then.<br /><br />The next article is from 1965, by Syun-Ichi Akasofu, on the Aurora.  This is the article that first got me interested in the Aurora, and I learned much more about it since then.  Akasofu, in a superb article, tells us about auroral substorms and the related polar electrojets and much more.  This is a very challenging field to do research in!<br /><br />James McDonald has an article, from 1954, on the shape of raindrops.  What do you suppose they look like?  Are they tapered?  Spherical?  Um, no.  They look more like small hamburger buns, nearly hemispherical.<br /><br />After that comes an article from 1966 by Luna Leopold and W. B. Langden, on river meanders.  That's a fun topic to think about; even Einstein wrote about river meanders once.  The authors show that the pattern of river meanders is consistent with the fact that in the absence of any other constraints, a \\"sine-generated curve is the most probable path of fixed length between two fixed points.\\"<br /><br />As someone with a college degree in acoustics, I especially liked the next article, from 1975, by Arthur Few.  It is about thunder!  Thunder is the result of shock waves generated by lightning, of course.  Less than a percent of the shock wave goes into an acoustic wave, but that's still enough to make thunder really loud.<br /><br />Ferren MacIntyre has an article from 1970, explaining why the sea is so salty.  He gives us a fine description of the geochemical cycle that is involved here.<br /><br />There is an article from 1959, by Willard Bascom, on ocean waves.  Of course, this is also an interesting topic for someone learning about acoustics, since fluid mechanics is a fundamental part of the subject.  The author includes a discussion of tsunamis.  Bascom said in the article that \\"within the next century we can expect that somewhere a wave will at least equal the one that swept the shores of the Bay of Bengal in 1876, leaving 200,000 dead.\\"<br /><br />The final article, by Joel Myers, is from 1968 and is about fog.  Fog is of course, simply a cloud on the ground.  Myers explains how fog can persist as long as it does.  He points out that smog is often misnamed, as it is generally simply a haze of pollutants that are trapped by an inversion layer of dry air rather than fog.<br /><br />I recommend this fine collection of articles about natural and familiar phenomena.is an article from 1959, by Willard Bascom, on ocean waves.

He points out that smog is often misnamed, as it is generally simply a haze of pollutants that are trapped by an inversion layer of dry air rather than fog. <br /> <br />I recommend this fine collection of articles about natural and familiar phenomena.	2005-03-07

How ungodly of them.<br /><br />Now I agree that language alone can be used to express political differences.  But it doesn't have to be that way.  We Americans call the capital city of Austria \\"Vienna.\\"  Hungarians call it \\"Becs.\\"  But that doesn't mean we have to fight about it.  These are simply translatable words.<br /><br />Had the author said that Hebrew is a language of peace while Arabic is a language of war, I think I'd point out that this is misleading.  Jews spent many centuries without fighting.  And even today, Israel is a small nation, which is why Jews can't consider aggressive and unprovoked wars now.  Meanwhile, some Arabs are in a more aggressive mood.  But I can't see the language as having much to do with it.  In any case, the author says that Hebrew is a language of war as opposed to the more peaceful Arabic, which is even more misleading.<br /><br />What has actually happened in the Arab-Israeli war is that some Arab irredentists have reacted very badly to the emancipation of the Jews.  They have decided that it is their right to oppress Jews, steal from Jews, and kill Jews at their discretion.  But it is tough to get any support by saying so.  That is why they have been defaming and taunting their opponents.  Still, I don't think it would help were I to call Arabic a language of lies and Hebrew a language of truth, even though they may look like it in this particular conflict.<br /><br />The author does mention choices of words, such as \\"contested\\" land versus \\"occupied\\" land.  But that is a word within a language.  It is not the case of two words for the same thing.  One word, \\"occupied,\\" is a lie.  That is a perfectly good word, it is just an untruth here.  The other word, \\"contested,\\" is the truth.  We are not seeing two versions of reality.  There is only one reality.  And Suleiman could have made it clear which one is true.<br /><br />In 1938, Germany wanted to take over Czechoslovakia.  So they invented a bogus nationality, called the Sudetens.  Now, the Sudeten Germans could have wanted their independence.  They could have been all sorts of things.  But what they actually happened to be was a fraud.  An excuse for Germany to deny human rights to the Czechs and no more.  Hurting the Czechs did nothing good for the Sudeten Germans, and it surely never helped them get the independence they did not want in the first place.<br /><br />In 1973, a bogus word was invented for some Levantine Arabs.  The pretense was that these Arabs were a nation that just happened to need to be exactly where Israel was.  In fact, the word referred to people who demanded to kick the Jews out of the Middle East and had little if any interest in a new Arab state unless they could use it to deprive Jews of human rights.  This word now exists only as an excuse for launching terrorist attacks on Jews.  It is not a pro-Arab word.  It is just a taunt.  Saying it precludes intelligent or honest discussion of Islamist opposition to human rights.  But the author didn't mention this.  Instead, he used this word himself.<br /><br />Does that mean that the war of words is indeed important?  I think it is.  But the reason that some of the words are important is that it the meanings behind them are vicious lies.  If we get rid of the lies, the choice of languages and phrases will not matter.over Czechoslovakia.  So they invented a bogus nationality, called the Sudetens.

Well, he's right.  Some Israelis do see some similarities.  And so do I.<br /><br />Of course, the author implies that it is evil to think such thoughts.  He's entitled to his opinion.  If he wants, he can say that \\"racism and violence have always been in Israeli culture.\\"  Matter of fact, he wrote exactly that.  That's a very misleading thing to write, but it seems that people can say anything, and this book proves it.<br /><br />The author says that the symbol of Israel is the bulldozer.  Not to me.  I might pick some nice, drip-irrigated fields.  And he does discuss the use of a National Socialist \\"vocabulary,\\" not by the Arab terrorists, but by the Israelis.<br /><br />Still, if the Israelis are not good enough for him, who is?  Surely nations in general are, on the average, worse than Israel.  What solution does that imply?  I think it would have been fair for him to explain that we humans have made a huge number of species extinct, but that only one more species has to go to end the slaughter.  That would have put his views into perspective.	2005-03-06

Sometimes, it is nearly incoherent.  But there's never a doubt that it is opposed to truth, logic, peace, justice, and human rights.<br /><br />It praises and apologizes for terrorist thugs.  And when it discusses the takeover of the Church of the Nativity by Muslim terrorists, there are quotes such as, \\"didn't Israel even try to portray the siege as Muslim gunmen who were holding the Christian priests hostage?\\"<br /><br />Is the author trying to say that Christian nuns are in fact a bunch of gun molls?  And that saying otherwise somehow insults them?<br /><br />I think we need to start with a note of sanity when discussing the issue of Arab terrorism against Israel.  Arab thugs are being greedy, arbitrary, destructive, immoral, and tyrannical by denying the Jews any rights.  They are being greedy when they claim that any amount of land, no matter how small, is too much for millions of Jews.  If everyone behaved like the Islamist fanatics, we'd all be at war all the time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Jews have been content to be restricted to about 10,000 square miles of Levantine land.  That makes them quite land-poor, given that there are over 5 million Israeli Jews.  And I'm sure they would be happy to buy more land.  But they are not demanding more.  They are willing to live and let live.  If everyone behaved like the Israeli Jews, human civilization would be prosperous and happy, with a bunch of little nations all striving for peace.<br /><br />What if everyone behaved like the Levantine Christians?  I'm not sure what would happen.  But I doubt that it would be any good!  I find it tough to have much respect for those who act so counterproductively.  And books like this certainly do not help.	2005-03-06

As well as an important explanation of the Althing and its structure.<br /><br />Plenty of us read one or more Icelandic sagas.  But these sagas were written for people who knew quite well where Iceland was and where the various parts of it were located.  They knew what an Icelandic house looked like, and they knew something of the terrain and the weather in the land.  They knew how Icelanders obtained food and what resources the country had.  And they knew all about the Althing (basically, their parliament).  To understand these sagas, we need to know some of this as well.  And Byock is wonderful at giving us this very valuable information.<br /><br />There is a good description of how justice worked in Iceland.  Blood vengeance was an option, but not a necessity.  Compromise was preferred.  Those who got too far out of line, say, with multiple murders, were outlawed.  That left enforcement of penalties up to others.  The system worked fairly well.<br /><br />Two things about Icelandic society made the strongest impression on me.  First, for many reasons, Icelandic society had enormous respect for truth.  Their writings have plenty of facts.  But more important (maybe because they were not numerous and lived on an island), there were very few secret felonies!  Most people confessed to murders at once, to try to avoid blood vengeance.  As Byock says, \\"rarely was there true secrecy\\" about who the guilty parties were.<br /><br />In any case, I think Byock has confirmed that in Icelandic society, perjury was a worse crime than murder.  That is very different from modern nations, where people on trial generally are expected to tell plenty of lies under oath and get away with it, and where government officials are expected to lie as well.  I got the feeling that Viking society happened to value truth very much indeed.<br /><br />Second, in spite of the value on truth, Icelanders valued pragmatism even more.  I think Byock makes the point about Icelandic pragmatism in his description of the Icelandic conversion to Christianity.  I see this event a little differently than Byock, but I have no problems at all with what he says about it.<br /><br />I think that what Byock says is consistent with my feeling that the Icelanders knew that Christianity was at best a perverse fraud and an untruth but accepted it anyway for pragmatic reasons.  However, I think the Vikings went too far here, and that a society with so much respect for truth that accepts a known lie as a rule to live by has simply destroyed itself.  If one accepts such a lie to preserve one's society, what is left to preserve?<br /><br />I recommend all of Byock's books.  I truly enjoyed reading this book, which may be his best.ople confessed to murders at once, to try to avoid blood vengeance.

The National Socialists did that in Germany in the 1930s.  It can happen again.  If you believe the author, it already has.<br /><br />It turns out the author is not telling the truth.  We do not yet have arbitrary and racist laws on international law books that insist that Israelis must be oppressed.  But if there are enough people like Boyle, one day we will.<br /><br />Still, as long as we're all going to be liars, thieves, and murderers, I see no need for bad laws.  If that is how we're all going to be, we do not need laws at all.<br /><br />That means that I think we ought to look at Boyle's seven recommendations from the point of view of believing in human civilization, not from an attitude of trying to destroy it.<br /><br />Boyle's first recommendation is for the UN to suspend Israel.  Given that Israel is not a problem, that won't accomplish anything positive.  But suppose it were a problem.  Getting Israel out of the UN still would not help matters.  Had Germany kicked all the anti-National Socialist nations out of the League of Nations, that would have been unhelpful.  But getting Germany out of the League of Nations was also unhelpful.<br /><br />In any case, I have a modest counterproposal.  Outlaw the UN, and put those who work for it on trial.  That will get the point across that actions have consequences.  Right now, folks at the UN figure they can do anything without any fear of responsibility or consequences.  But that can be changed.<br /><br />Boyle's second proposal is to use international laws as a basis for peace.  Again, I have a counterproposal.  Use truth as a basis for peace.  And make laws consistent with justice.<br /><br />I think that the vindication of theft and murder will not bring peace.  The falsely accused victims will scoff at bad laws in the future.  The falsely acquitted thugs will try their hand at more crimes.  But the vindication of the so far falsely accused Israelis will have a very positive effect on them, and reassure them that they can be treated fairly.  It will also teach the Arabs that being led by thugs is bad for their foreign policy, not just for their domestic policy.<br /><br />The third Boyle recommendation is to dump the \\"dishonest broker,\\" namely the United States.  My comment is that the problem is the international community.  If we want human civilization to thrive, we need to do something about this problem.  Ending the demonization of Israel will not suffice.<br /><br />The author's fourth recommendation is to impose economic, diplomatic, and travel restrictions on Israel.  That's silly, of course.  Ignoring the fact that it is unfair, it may not even accomplish anything.  People can be pressured into falsely admitting to crimes, or to committing crimes, or even into killing themselves.  But innocent people can not be shamed into doing any of these things.  In World War Two, the Jews could not be shamed into dying by the millions.  It required mass murder to make them die in such numbers.<br /><br />Boyle's fifth recommendation is to set up an International Criminal Tribunal to prosecute the bad guys (but not their victims) as war criminals, both military and civilian, especially political leaders.  I agree completely, and I would include propagandists on my list to prosecute.  In World War Two, some of my civilian relatives were murdered by the Russians.  But the Russians were not tried for war crimes after the war, the Germans were.  I think this was proper.  If you keep putting the victims on trial, you'll never convict the aggressors.<br /><br />Here too, I have one minor change to make in what Boyle says.  He wants to prosecute only the Israelis, not the Arabs.  He has it backwards.  We must prosecute only the Arabs and their allies, not the Israelis.  Put the bad guys on trial!<br /><br />The sixth recommendation is a World Court lawsuit for genocide.  Given the number of Israelis who have been killed and maimed by Arab terrorists, I think a lawsuit would be appropriate.  Arab and European money has funded such crimes, and a lawsuit would attack some of the problem at the source.<br /><br />The seventh and final recommendation is a divestment and disinvestment campaign.  Of course, it is from Israel, which as I said earlier, won't be shamed into becoming bad, but might be pressured into it.  My guess is that it will take considerable pressure to get rid of their rights entirely.  But this book has given me plenty of good ideas.  Such a campaign against the antizionists might actually work.  They are the ones who can see that they are opposing truth, justice, and human rights.  There really is a potential for shaming them into becoming more decent.<br /><br />This book didn't deserve a star, but I gave it one anyway.nd European money has funded such crimes, and a lawsuit would attack some of the problem at the source.

Then this book may be for you!<br /><br />It is about people who are doing their part to make a big mess out of human civilization.  And it praises them!<br /><br />Of course, human civilization will probably survive attacks on it.  And those who are now so proud to fight against it will be forgotten, or at best, despised.<br /><br />This book is racist propaganda that favors arbitrary discrimination against Asian Jews.  The claim is that doing so will somehow help some Arabs, but I see no reason to believe that such an attack on human rights will help Arabs.<br /><br />Want some facts?  Then simply avoid this book.  It starts by giving a little background information.  \\"Zionist forces launched assualts\\" against Arabs in December, 1947, it proclaims.  Wow.  In real life, it was the other way around, with the Arabs launching attacks on the Jews.  And the book continues to make hash of history and reality.  Many of the contributors are infamous for their hatred of truth on this subject, including Noam Chomsky, Mustafa Barghouti, Ed Said, Adam Shapiro, Rachel Corrie, and the Wicked Witch of the Middle East herself, Hanan Ashrawi.<br /><br />Starhawk is one of the contributors, proving that being a Pagan does not give one immunity from supporting thugs.  She argues that the fence that Israel has been putting up to try to save civilian lives from terrorist bombers is a bad thing.<br /><br />Now I agree with Starhawk that we ought not fence people off from each other unnecessarily.  We need peace in the area, and we need both Jews and Arabs to be able to live in all the nations of the Middle East.  And this fence may look like a step in the wrong direction in that respect.<br /><br />In fact, the fence is there simply to save some lives.  If we keep letting bombers kill civilians, we'll have even less cooperation in the region.  The real argument against the fence is that it may help save Jewish lives.  And Starhawk is to be condemned for giving her voice in support of that.  She's not doing any Pagans any favors by siding with the forces of tyrannical and arbitrary monotheist fanaticism.<br /><br />I do not recommend this book.of that.

That is too much.  It must have nothing.  And Israelis have rights.  Those rights must be removed.<br /><br />Well, that's the wrong answer.  Do we really want to see how the author comes up with such a ridiculously wrong answer?  We don't, and that is why it is not worth reading this book.<br /><br />Sure, if we make it an international priority, we can cheat a few minorities.  Maybe we can annihilate all the Peruvians, or the Danish, or the Dutch, or the Israelis, or the Latvians, or the Czechs, or the Basques.  But we won't gain anything by doing so.  And, more important, if we simply do nothing of the sort, groups of millions of people will indeed tend to acquire both individual rights and sovereign rights over tens of thousands of square miles, not just thousands of square miles.<br /><br />This book is simply propaganda that attempts, quite arbitrarily, to take away the rights of life, liberty, and property from Asia's Jews.  And as a first step, demonize, discredit, libel, and destroy the state of Israel, which is guilty of the crime of protecting Jewish rights within its borders.<br /><br />In this book, each day of the existence of Israel is a crime.  This is the fundamental concept here.  The funny thing is that Israel is land-poor.  If I wanted to steal land, I sure wouldn't pick on Israel.  It has so little land that it isn't worth it.  If I didn't want Israel to get bigger, I'd simply make peace with it.<br /><br />Anyway, the book gives us some excuses for attacking Israel.  Needless to say, logic, truth, justice, and human rights are thrown out the window in this parade of ghastly propaganda.<br /><br />We see the argument that because there were more Arabs than Jews, the Arabs had a right to do what they pleased with the Jews.  Of course, in the UN partition region earmarked for the Jews, the Jews were a majority.  But that doesn't count.  We are told that the Jews owned a small fraction of the land.  We are not told that the Arabs also owned a small fraction of the land.  Arab genocidal attacks on the Jews are dismissed, and we're told even in the introduction that the Jews are basically no more than a robber band.  Nice taunts.  But it's silly to waste such juicy words on the Jews.  One day, some real live bad guys may show up, and no one will be listening any more.<br /><br />Look at the chapters in the book.  Many of them are about \\"Zionist crimes.\\"  This for one of the most praiseworthy nations on the planet!  The bulk of the events in the recent history of the region are simply called Zionist crimes.<br /><br />Nakleh discusses the reaction of Zionists to the infamous White Paper of 1939, which barred Jews from fleeing to the Levant from Europe, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people or more.  This infamous act convinced most Jews that a Jewish state was needed to protect Jewish rights.  But Nakleh says that the Zionist goal was not to save Jews, but to prevent Levantine Arab independence!  That's preposterous.<br /><br />The author claims that 81% of the 1948 Levantine Arab refugees left their homes through direct action of the Zionists.  But, in fact, the Arabs were the aggressors!<br /><br />Nakleh says there was a \\"conspiracy\\" to expel the Levantine Arabs from their homes and says that this conspiracy and the expulsion itself \\"were war crimes inevitably associated with the 'Master Race\\" basis of Zionist ideology.\\"  He calls Zionist ideology intrinsically evil and says the expulsion of the Arabs was a \\"premeditated crime.\\"  All this is absurd.  Zionism is simply Jewish nationalism.  It demands human rights for Jews on the grounds that all humans (including Jews) deserve human rights.  Opposition to Zionism in reality is simply opposition to human rights.<br /><br />Most nations are far worse than Israel.  If it is right to get rid of the Israelis, it is right to get rid of everyone else.  Do we really want to do that?  Why not write a book in praise of our species?  Or at least write one that has some constructive criticism for it?  Why write a book that simply mocks and taunts everyone?<br /><br />I think we all ought to warn our friends about books such as this one.s, it is right to get rid of everyone else.

This is a superb introductory book about the Dutch Defence.  It is appropriate for chess players of a wide variety of strengths: the Dutch is a good defence for a beginner to learn.  I started out with it, having read Botvinnik's book (One Hundred Selected Games).  And I still play it sometimes as Black, after 1 Nf3 f5 (what I play if White continues with 2 e4 I'll leave to your imagination).  Occasionally, I also get into the Dutch after inviting a Meran Defence with 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 c6.  If White now plays 4 e3, I may well reply 4...f5.  Others get into the Dutch the way Botvinnik did, by inviting a French Defence with 1 d4 e6 and then (when White plays 2 c4) replying 2...f5.  Those who want to get into a \\"Leningrad Dutch\\" (makes me wonder when the Dutch will finally invade Russia and capture Leningrad) sometimes start with 1 d4 d6.  Of course, they play a Pirc or a Modern Defence if White plays 2 e4.<br /><br />Reading this book, I got the idea that playing the Dutch means never having to say \\"I resign!\\"  You simply play on until mate.  It isn't tough, generally only one or two more moves.<br /><br />McDonald is a great chess teacher.  He begins by warning us about gambit attacks on the Dutch.  Here, he cites an Awful Example: 1 d4 f5 2 h3 Nf6 3 g4 fxg4 4 hxg4 Nxg4 5 Qd3 Nf6? 6 Rxh7 Rxh7 7 Qg6 mate.  That was quick!  He tells us to play 3...d5 here and avoid this mess.<br /><br />He gives more examples of gambit lines, such as the hilarious game 1 d4 f5 2 e4 fxe4 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 Bg5 e6? 5 Nxe4 Be7 6 Bxf6! Bxf6 7 Nf3 0-0 8 Bd3 b6 9 Ne5 Bb7 10 Qh5 Qe7 11 Qxh7+! Kh7 12 Nxf6+ Kh6 13 Neg4+ Kg5 14 h4+ Kf4 15 g3+ Kf3 16 Be2+ Kg2 17 Rh2+ Kg1 (do I get a new King for reaching the 8th rank?) 18 Kd2 mate.  We also see some games with 2 Bg5.  One of the few lines McDonald omits is 2 Qd3, but 2...d5 is a solid reply here of course.<br /><br />The author spends some useful time on the Stonewall variation.  All Dutch players need to be familiar with its ideas, because it may be best to transpose into them.  One terrific example is, of course, with Botvinnik playing Black.  1 d4 e6 2 c4 f5 3 g3 Nf6 4 Bg2 Bb4+ 5 Bd2 Be7 6 Nc3 0-0 7 Qc2 d5! 8 Nf3 c6 9 0-0 Qe8 10 Bf4 Qh5 11 Rae1 Nbd7 12 Nd2 g5!

Israel's accomplishments are something all humans can point to with pride.  We humans can indeed make great progress in medicine, science, technology, agriculture, society, and outreach.  Even a nation of just a few million people can do it.  Some nations on this planet are producing very little of lasting value.  Others are producing more.  Some, of course, are consuming more.  But we can all see from this book that Israel is more than pulling its own weight.  It is holding up far more than its share of the sky!<br /><br />This book shows why Israel ought to serve as an example for all of us.  It's exciting to see how much can be done by an educated society.  This is not a secret: all human society can and should try to emulate (or even exceed) Israel's behavior here.<br /><br />I'll mention just one of the many examples of what Israelis have done, drip irrigation.  This process, which dramatically increases water productivity, was developed by Israelis, and it has helped people in a wide variety of nations.  Bananas in the Ivory Coast, sugar cane in Mauritius, melons in Mexico, vegetables in India, strawberries in Indonesia, and grapes in Germany are just a few of the products grown using this technique, with the help of Israeli companies.  We also see a low-sugar fruit, the pepo, developed by Israelis especially with diabetics in mind.<br /><br />I know that some folks prefer not to applaud Israel but regard it with envy.  That is not the true path.  Those of us who want our species and civilization to have a future should start by praising what is good about it.  And this book certainly contributes to that.	2005-03-04

In Germany, it took years for the National Socialist government to implement a policy of complete annihilation of the Jewish population.  In Transylvania, this happened in a much shorter time.  It is mind-boggling.<br /><br />I think you can understand that I was in no hurry to read this book.  Too depressing!  But I finally did so.  And I looked for silver linings in this huge cloud.  Notes of hope.<br /><br />I didn't find many.  Sure, there were plenty of good people.  But they didn't seem to make enough of a difference most of the time.<br /><br />Of course, the details in the book are heartbreaking, right through to the final words, where the author looks at himself in the mirror at the end of his ordeal and sees \\"a corpse\\" looking back at him, a face he says he never forgot.<br /><br />Others ask about what human beings are really like, or what God is really like, or how one ought to behave.  Well, I asked myself these sorts of questions too, and I doubt that I have anything new or useful to contribute about them.  Still, what most struck me about these questions was the role of authority.  We are used to obeying commands.  When we're told to report to a place at a certain time or face consequences, we do it.  And so on.  But in that time period, obeying commands was an ideal way to get oneself killed and also enable more killing.  The best chance of survival was to disobey just those commands which looked most important to obey.  And if one generalizes, what kind of world would we have if everyone were so suspicious of others that we rejected most of their advice and orders?<br /><br />Somehow, I concluded that of all the crimes, the worst may have been coming up with rules, commands, judgments, and laws that were designed to hurt and kill others.  These remove the trust we need to have both in our fellow humans and in our most cherished institutions.<br /><br />As I said, I didn't find much to be happy about in this book.  Still, I highly recommend it.  It's well written, and I think we owe it to ourselves to read it.hurt and kill others.

There is a problem with this, given that the history of the Patriarchs is part legend.  But it is recent enough so that there is real history to cover plenty of what was going on in the Middle East at the time.  And Eban reminds us that the religion of Abraham was not that of, say, Moses.  Abraham's \\"God was not unique, omnipresent, or fully transcendent.  He was the deity of Abraham's family, not of other families, still less of all mankind.\\"<br /><br />The author traces the history of the Hebrews from then on, through the age of judges, Kings and Queens, Exile, Roman dominion, the Diaspora, and so on.  I was intrigued by the effect of the Fourth Lateran Council, convened in 1215 by Pope Innocent III.  This Council appears to have been directly responsible for the next three centuries of Jewish expulsions from various countries in Europe.<br /><br />There is an excellent discussion of Theodore Herzl and the rise of Modern Zionism.  Eban has over a page of quotes from Herzl's Diaries about it.  \\"What made me into a Zionist was the Dreyfus case.\\" \\"Death to Jews all because one was a traitor?  But was he really a traitor?\\"  \\"In a lower stratum of society, I would deny such a possibility among Jews as little as among Christians.  In Alfred Dreyfus's case, however, it was psychologically impossible.  A wealthy man, who had chosen this career only through ambition, simply could not have committed the most dishonorable of all crimes.\\"  Herzl realized that Dreyfus's desire for honor was too great for him to have done it.<br /><br />By the way, not only did the case make Herzl a Zionist, I think it ought to make every human being a Zionist.  Zionism is Jewish nationalism, and that is merely a commitment to human rights for all people (including Jews).<br /><br />The author discusses the fate of the Jews during World War Two.  He explains that the slaughter of the Jews was not the work of only a few people.  \\"Thousands of officials were necessary to carry out these tasks.\\"<br /><br />Nor were the Germans and their allies the only culprits.  Lord Moyne, the British Colonial Secretary, refused to allow Romanian Jews to immigrate to the Levant in 1941.  Instead, he helped keep the notorious British White Paper of 1939 in force.  Moyne later insisted that Britian could \\"not be a party to any measures which could undermine the existing policy regarding illegal immigration\\" into the Levant.  Perhaps it is not surprising that justice was served when Moyne was assassinated in 1944.<br /><br />Nor is it surprising that Chaim Weizmann, speaking at the 1946 Zionist Congress, in a classic understatement said of the 1939 White Paper, \\"Few documents in history have worse consequences for which to answer.\\"<br /><br />The book continues through the Six Day War and beyond.  That war actually began not on June 5, 1967 with the Israeli air strikes on Egypt but on May 22, 1967 when Egypt's Nasser announced the imposition of a blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba.  In a speech (on May 22) which \\"settled for all time the question of responsibility for the 1967 war,\\" Nasser said:<br /><br />\\"Taking over Sharm-el-Sheikh means confrontation with Israel.  Taking such action means that we are ready to enter war with Israel.  It is not a separate action.  The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel.\\"<br /><br />In retrospect, the Arab side would have profited little from defeating Israel.  They also failed to profit from losing to it.  That's still the case.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.e necessary to carry out these tasks.\\"      Nor were the Germans and their allies the only culprits.

You see, some folks claim that some books about the Middle East merely parrot a bunch of anti-Zionist myths and taunts.  This is one of the books that proves them right.<br /><br />Ross says that by 1945, Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini's reputation was \\"tarnished\\" because he moved to Germany in World War Two and entered into \\"negotiations\\" with the Nazis.  Well, that surely is one way to put it!<br /><br />The author continues by saying that more fervent Zionists were \\"irked\\" by Britain \\"limiting\\" further Jewish immigration to the Levant with the 1939 White Paper.  That also is one way of putting it.  I think that some of the more fervent Tutsis were also irked by the fact that 800,000 of them were slaughtered by Hutus.  Now I know what \\"irked\\" means, I guess.<br /><br />We also hear of secret meetings between Jordanian King Abdullah and Golda Meir in 1948.  Of course, their meeting is totally misrepresented by the author.<br /><br />What do you suppose Ross says about the assassination of Count Bernadotte?  He says that the UN mediator was killed because he \\"seemed too pro-Arab.\\"  This ignores the question of why opposition to human rights of life, liberty, and property might be synonymous with being \\"pro-Arab.\\"  I also think the author ought to have had the nerve to say what Bernadotte did and let us readers judge him ourselves.<br /><br />What about the six-day war?  Our intrepid author blames the Jews, of course.  I wonder why he praises the Arab aggressors and blames the Israeli defenders.  The benefit of doing this is not clear to me.  Such misrepresentations are not going to lead to peace or harmony.<br /><br />Ross says that Egypt's Nasser \\"felt obliged\\" to re-occupy Sharm al-Sheikh.  Now Nasser did say at the time that Egypt was ready for war.  And in no uncertain terms!  But the author wants to blame Israel, so he explains away Nasser's statement by saying \\"It was not what he meant at all.\\"  If I could misrepresent facts the way Ross does, I think I could prove anything.<br /><br />Now we get to the topic of Arab terrorism.  What do we get to read about one of the worst human beings of the twentieth century, Arafat?  Do we read about his vicious slaughters of innocent civilians?  His constant lies and taunts?  Or even his misuse of funds?<br /><br />What we read is that Arafat overcame his drawbacks \\"with an exceptional vitality that combined passion, determination, charm, and bravery.\\"<br /><br />That takes the cake.  Obviously, such words, true or false, could be used to describe any thug or mass murderer.  But what does it say about the writer?  Only a person wholly committed to opposing human rights could dream of associating the words Arafat and charm in such a manner.<br /><br />How about the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which was in response to terrorist attacks from there?  And which did drive Arafat's gang out of Lebanon?  Ross says it is the other way around.  He talks about Israel's incursions into Lebanon as if Arafat belonged there.  And then he says \\"Arafat refused to play ball.  Despite repeated incursions into Lebanon, the PLO did not retaliate.\\"  I think a reader who wants to learn about the Middle East might want to check some of the other books I have reviewed about the topic to decide if this is a good description of events.<br /><br />The author does not like Jewish settlements in the West Bank.  He calls them an \\"obvious affront\\" to the Arabs.  And he implies that the settlements are simply a theft of Arab land.<br /><br />The only problem with all this is that the land is disputed.  Jews and Arabs have equal rights to it.  Jews may well feel that the presence of Arabs in the West Bank is an \\"obvious affront.\\"  One day, some other group of people (maybe one with a truly immense army) may feel that the presence of Arabs is an obvious affront.  Is the author trying to say that this will justify the ethnic cleansing of Arabs?  Or is hetrying to say that the Arabs are the only real people in the world, and that the Arabs are justified in stealing whatever they want whenever they want?<br /><br />Ross mentions Arab riots over the opening of a door to a tunnel in the Old City of Jerusalem.  The tunnel was already open near the Western Wall.  This door was at the other end of the tunnel.  But Ross tries to imply that this somehow threatened the al-Aqsa mosque.  Hey, maybe it threatened the Kaaba and the Kremlin as well.  Stories like these are not facts.  They are so obviously untrue that they count as taunts.<br /><br />In 2000, we read that Ariel Sharon killed the peace process by visiting the Temple Mount.  This leaves unasked the question of why one more visit to Judaism's holiest site, in the middle of the capital of Israel, ought to provoke a murderous Arab riot.  Oh, but that wasn't the only provocation.  In addition, we are told that a 12-year old Arab boy was \\"shot several times by Israeli soldiers.\\"  But it is extremely unlikely that Israelis actually shot this boy.  In fact, the incident may well have been entirely staged.  In any case, the author owed it to us to tell us this, as well as to tell us about the saturation of the international information supply with anti-Israeli propaganda.  We're also entitled to know that much of the reporting of events from Israel is indeed staged.<br /><br />Obviously, I do not recommend this horrible book.the ethnic cleansing of Arabs?

332062:US	53071109	R10A4UPREIQL00	1857443748	851017766	Starting Out: Rook Endgames	Books	5	28	30	N	N	An excellent book on a very basic aspect of chess	Rook endgames are fundamental to chess.  And this book can be read by a complete beginner.  All one needs to know is the rules and how to checkmate with King and rook against a lone King.<br /><br />The author does get off to a bad start with his first (and worst) diagram (how did those Kings get there?).  But the rest of the book is excellent.  The only improvement I might make would be to include a little on endgames with two rooks on each side.<br /><br />Ward begins with some absolute basics.  Rooks belong behind passed pawns!  Checks from the side sometimes salvage draws.  Shoulder off that enemy King!  Push passed pawns!  Keep your rook away from the enemy King.  Cut off the enemy King.<br /><br />We learn about the Opposition.  And we learn the most important thing about rook endgames: rooks need to be active.  You put them on open files.  And on the seventh rank.  And you consider sacrificing a pawn to activate your rook.<br /><br />We learn that when you have a pawn on the seventh and a rook defending it on the eighth, the \\"skewer\\" trick is often the way to win.<br /><br />We see examples of King and rook versus pawns.  And we discover that when the defending King is far away, two connected pawns on the sixth defeat the rook.<br /><br />Ward then teaches us to defend with King and rook versus King, rook and pawn.  These positions are drawn unless the defender has a bad King position or an inactive rook.  When we have the better King position and the pawn, we learn how to reach the Lucena position and win.  And we learn some more tricks, such as stalemate threats and underpromotion.<br /><br />We also are shown endgames where each side has several pawns.  Of course, a basic aspect of rook endgames is that a pawn advantage is often not enough to win, while that same advantage tends to win with the rooks off the board.  The defender almost never wants to swap rooks!  When considering a rook swap, we're reminded to be really sure about the ensuing pawn endgame.<br /><br />We see why an extra pawn, with all pawns on the same side of the board, is usually a draw.  And we are shown that a 3 to 1 advantage on one side of the board and a 2 to 1 disadvantage on the other side is much better than a 3 to 2 advantage on one side and 1 to 1 on the other.<br /><br />I liked the fact that we are shown a little about how to defend with King and rook against a King, rook, and two isolated pawns (a and h files or a and c files).  That's important, albeit somewhat tricky.<br /><br />Ward finishes with some practical examples from his games.  At the end, there is an easy quiz with twenty multiple choice questions (and detailed answers).<br /><br />I recommend this book.

Gold was terrific at doing precisely this in his scientific career.<br /><br />A major part of this book is about planetary subsurface life.  Gold argues that life on Earth has a subsurface origin, that photosynthesis was an offshoot of subsurface life, and that the origin of terrestrial hydrocarbons is primarily primordial.<br /><br />The author begins by describing hyperthermophilic life near hot ocean vents.  Gold calls this environment a borderline region between the surface and subsurface worlds.  He also asks where such life gets its oxygen.  He answers that organisms spend some energy to grab oxygen from sulfates (which also releases it for use by other organisms).  And he explains that these organisms get their energy back with interest when they use that oxygen to process hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide.<br /><br />Right now, petroleum is generally regarded as a \\"fossil fuel.\\"  However, it has never been clear that most petroleum is derived from living organisms.  The biogenic theory of petroleum became accepted because it seemed likely that any primordial petroleum would have been oxidized by high temperature rocks that made up the early Earth.  However, there is now evidence that suggests that the Earth was, um, not so hot back then (it only partially melted).  There is also evidence that hydrocarbons are primordial and that they are stable at great depth.  Gold also tells us that rock at depth contains pores and that hydrocarbons are still upwelling.<br /><br />Finally, the author cites the fact that 84 barrels of oil were drilled from a depth of 6 kilometers in a purely granitic and igneous region of Sweden.  Remains of living organisms should have had no access whatsoever to this place.  So Gold may indeed be right about the abiogenic origin of much of the world's petroleum.  Does all this mean that this planet has more oil than we previously thought?  It could.  Still, even if it does, much of that oil could be tough to get to, especially if we want it quickly.<br /><br />Gold concludes with some speculations about the nature of earthquakes, about the origin of life, and about the possibilities for subsurface extraterrestrial life.<br /><br />I highly recommend this interesting book.ean that this planet has more oil than we previously thought?

About how we're a bunch of meddling isolationists!  About how we always do whatever Israel wants, and completely turn our backs on the entire Middle East.  And how we are an easily led herd of isolated and uncontrollable individuals!<br /><br />Of course, it is easy to make fun of self-contradictory criticisms.  But Revel shows that these criticisms are often used in tandem on purpose, so that at least one is always applicable.  That's one way we can tell that the criticism is insincere and not constructive.<br /><br />Another example of being criticized no matter what we do comes from de Gaulle's excuse for excluding France from participating in NATO militarily.  He said that the United States did come to France's aid in both World War One and World War Two, but we showed up tardily.  Yes, we did.  As the author points out, that was the main reason for NATO in the first place, so that we would not be tardy the next time.<br /><br />Revel asks just which groups refused to observe three minutes of silence for the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  The answer?  Xenophobes, partisans of regressive and repressive regimes, antiglobalists, and so-called \\"Greens.\\"<br /><br />Anti-Americanism necessarily includes a number of blatant misrepresentations of America.  One excellent example that Revel gives involves the Kyoto Protocol.  Out of 168 nations that were signatories, zero had ratified it by mid-2001.  That included the United States.  But anti-Americans made it appear that the United States was going against the rest of the world here.  I feel that some constructive criticism would have been a good idea here.  But this wasn't it.<br /><br />The author explains that many people all over the world admire our American lifestyle.  I think this is a good point.  Whatever our faults, much of what we do is positive.  Many elements of our lifestyle and freedoms could be copied even by poorer nations, and the result would be plenty of happier people.  Unless our critics are willing to take this into account, they are going to be regarded as incoherent.<br /><br />Revel's conclusion is that the critics are being counterproductive by attacking America even if it is in the right.  That will only lead to the critics no longer being taken seriously when we are wrong and they are right.by poorer nations, and the result would be plenty of happier people.

But there are statements in it that we can all relate to.<br /><br />At one point, Anidjar compares the Arab-Israeli dispute to the Hutu genocide against the Tutsi.  He wisely asks who in Israel \\"are the Hutu and who the Tutsi?\\"  That's not a bad question.  I'm tempted to answer by pointing out that French support has been for both the Hutu and Arab sides.  But more seriously, I think there is no question about genocidal propaganda and acts.  In Israel, the Jews are the Tutsi.  That is true even though the Jews are the majority in Israel, given the huge number of Arabs in countries bordering Israel.  It's not a tough question after all, and Anidjar could have said so, clearly and simply.<br /><br />At another point, Anidjar makes a clear statement of his own.  Namely, \\"without this enemy par excellance that is Islam, Europe, Christian Europe, would not exist or would no longer exist.\\"<br /><br />Now that may be a profound point.  But it seems to me that for the past two centuries, the existence of Europe has in no way depended on Islam.  Had Islam collapsed at the end of 1804, Europe would not have fallen apart as a result.  Nor would Christian Europe.  As a matter of fact, if Islam is to cause the end of Christian Europe, it is far more likely to do so by defeating it than by losing to it.<br /><br />Nor do I think there is anything profound about the enmity between Jew and Arab.  Even a dog knows the difference between being tripped over and kicked.  If you keep getting kicked, or insist on kicking, you'll wind up with an enemy.  Jews were treated as dhimmis by Arabs for quite a while.  When many Jews became emancipated, some Arabs felt humiliated by their liberation and decided to do plenty of kicking.  On the other side, plenty of Jews decided how to deal with being kicked.  Now, was that tough to say?<br /><br />We also get to think about the extent to which Jews learned to kick from the Nazis.  After all, Jews learned plenty about how the Nazis behaved.  In spite of having been victims, did the Jews simply decide to do unto the totally innocent Arabs what the Nazis had done to the Jews?  What can we learn from this?<br /><br />Anidjar actually should have explained that there is something we can learn.  The Jews, having been terribly mistreated by the Nazis, have shown a great aversion to doing anything that looks like what the Nazis did.  Knowing this, enemies of the Jews tend to taunt them by pretending that Jewish behavior is similar to Nazi behavior (as well as by pretending that Arab behavior is somehow similar to how Jews behaved in Nazi Europe).  Of course, the author didn't say all this.<br /><br />This book is awfully weak and uninspiring.the Nazis behaved.

They include:<br /><br />\\"Why have generations of Europeans been taught in universities to despise America and to harbor an implacable hatred for Israel?\\"<br /><br />\\"Has the 1930s - World War II alliance of Arab jihadists with European Nazis and fascist trends been resurrected today?\\"<br /><br />\\"Why does Europe call 'inviolable international boundaries' the 1949 armistice lines between Jordan and Israel, which were never recognized then as international boundaries by the Arab/Muslim world nor by other states?\\"<br /><br />She also asks if the Arab jihad against Israel merely aims at eliminating Israel or has more ominous designs.  And she points out that since jihad does target Christianity worldwide, European support for jihad is self-destructive.<br /><br />Bat Ye'or attributes this self-capitulation to Arab demands to a number of causes, including French anti-Americanism, some antisemitism, and also mutual interests in getting political power in Europe.  This book describes the European cult of Levantine Arabism.  It is a counterproductive cult, given the degree to which it perverts organizations.  When human rights organizations are applauding terrorism, something has clearly gone wrong.<br /><br />It might appear that European society is stable and immune from a major catastrophe.  And my initial reaction to the increasing Islamization of Europe has been positive: it ought to make the place more cosmopolitan and makes the society stronger.  However, if the result is a totalitarian takeover, we have more reason to be concerned.  Bat Ye'or knows that societies that look stable can vanish.  Her local one did.  She grew up in Egypt, and the Jews of Egypt are long gone now.<br /><br />Reading this book, I was reminded of Arthur Koestler's \\"Promise and Fulfilment.\\"  In that book, Koestler explained how the British abandoned their commitment to the Zionists.  According to Koestler, Britain did not sacrifice the Jews to her oil interests, instead, \\"oil interests served as a pretext for her sincere wish to liquidate her Zionist commitments.\\"  I remember how struck I was by this self-blackmail.  About how the British \\"wanted to be bullied and blackmailed out of their commitments to the Jews, and they created the instrument for Arab bullying and blackmail.\\"<br /><br />Koestler wrote that in 1949.  Bat Ye'or's description of European support for Arafat looks eerily like the same kind of self-blackmail.  She traces it from 1967, when de Gaulle dramatically ended French support for Israel just before the six-day war.  And the oil embargo served as a useful pretext for establishment of European anti-Israeli policies.<br /><br />French support for Arab irredentism after that almost single-handedly precluded peace between the combatants.  In 1973, Europeans were instrumental in the creation of a bogus Levantine Arab \\"people\\"  and the \\"internationalization of what was essentially a regional conflict.\\"<br /><br />As the author explains, the anti-Israeli cult is at its most obvious when one looks at European media.  One of many examples is that television filming has been \\"coordinated to show only children stone-throwers, carefully avoiding the gunmen behind them.\\"  During the Lebanon war, Arafat's thugs \\"inflicted mass murder, abductions, untold suffering, and destruction on over a hundred thousand Christians in Lebanon.\\"  However, \\"the valiant Christian resistance was demonized by a European press\\" that sided with Arafat and his gang.<br /><br />Ye'or explains that \\"you cannot teach people hate and then ask them to practice peace.\\"  This cult of hate needs to cease.  And Bat Ye'or says that Europeans have to stop acting like dhimmis.  Right now, \\"flattery, servility, anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism, coupled with a tremendous fear of Islamic terrorism, dominate current European media and political discourse.\\"  And Arab Christians are basically Marcionists: they've dispensed with their Old Testaments.  Meanwhile, Arab terrorists, bolstered by a huge flow of funds from Europe, have become stronger.  The author, quoting Rachel Ehrenfeld, thinks that 'maybe it's time to hold European donors legally accountable for their investments.'<br /><br />The point of this book is not that Europe is changing.  Many societies change.  The point is that this change looks counterproductive and not entirely desirable.<br /><br />I have to agree with the premise that this alliance is destructive.  After all, what benefit will there be to the people of Europe or the Arab world if they manage to destroy Israel?  Not much.  Israel is small, and there isn't much to steal.  And the abandonment of truth, justice and human rights will outweigh any benefit that might exist.<br /><br />This is an excellent book.  It explains why Europe is making sure that the Arab-Israeli dispute will have little chance of being resolved.  And it envisions a potentially unhappy future for much of Europe.  I highly recommend it.b terrorists, bolstered by a huge flow of funds from Europe, have become stronger.

It seems to be addressed to Jews in general.  But it doesn't appear to have much advice for most of them.  Of course, Rushkoff is completely free to follow whatever religious views he pleases.  The question is whether this book has much to offer anyone, Jewish or non-Jewish.<br /><br />Rushkoff traces the history of Judaism, a religion he appears to feel is not quite monotheistic enough!  Let's just say that I would not have thought of this criticism.  He then deals with the question of whether Jews are a race or whether they are simply individuals who follow Judaism as an idea.  Well, that is a good question.  Perhaps Jews ought to be more active in seeking converts.  But I think this exaggerates reality: plenty of people convert to Judaism.<br /><br />Another problem with the claim of Judaism simply being a collection of individuals is this: denial of rights to Jews is an attack on not only specific individuals, but also on the Hebrew-speaking people as well as on human rights in general.  It does no good to pretend that there is no such thing as homo sapiens, or no such thing as the Hebrew-speaking people.<br /><br />Well, what does the author think of Zionism?  It's too religious for him!  Had Zionism only been secular, it would have worked!<br /><br />With all due respect to the author, this is totally preposterous.  A typical early kibbutz was about the most secular community one could have imagined.  Attacks on Zionism have generally been due to the secularism of the Zionists.  Even religious attacks on Zionism would not be mitigated were the Zionists all to assure everyone of their secularism!  Zionists do insist on rights to life, liberty, and property.  But this is true for both religious and secular Zionists.  Were all Zionists secular, they would still demand their rights.<br /><br />I'm sure the author means well.  But I do not recommend this book to anyone.	2005-02-27

Books	5	18	18	N	N	Well, maybe a better term would be "undead"	This is a fine chess book on how to play the Latvian Gambit (1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 f5), for either side.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Latvian Gambit is not sound.  I think of all Black defences to 1 e4, it may be the one that maximizes White's play.<br /><br />Still, you have a Right to play it!  Don't let anyone deprive you of that right!  Especially if you have Black against me!<br /><br />The Latvian does get its share of points, albeit with rather few draws.  It can be played in tournament games, five-minute games, and even correspondence games.  You can play it against strong, average, or weak opponents.  Contrary to popular belief, it does not take much effort to play it for Black.  The ideas for Black are straightforward.  If White wastes time, Black will get plenty of play.  And if Black gets the chance, she'll probably castle quickly, open the f-file, and blast away at f2.<br /><br />If, Caissa forbid, you want to play the Latvian for Black as though it were a sound defence, that means vowing to try to play the objectively strongest move at every opportunity after move 2 (if you did that at move two, you would have played 2...Nc6).  And that's where this excellent book comes in handy.  The main lines are easy to learn, and this book teaches them well.<br /><br />The main line for White is 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 f5 3 Nxe5 Qf6 4 d4 d6 5 Nc4 fxe4 6 Nc3 Qg6.  Here, White has many tries, and if you simply must play this for Black, I recommend looking at the following lines in the book:<br /><br />7 f3 exf3 8 Qxf3 Nf6 9 Bd3 Qg4<br />7 Bf4 Nf6 8 Qd2 Be7 9 0-0-0 0-0 (a popular choice for White, but I prefer Black here)<br />7 Ne3 Nf6 8 Be2 c6 9 0-0 Be7<br />7 Be3 Nf6 8 h3 Be7 9 Qd2 0-0 10 0-0-0 c6<br />7 Nd5 Qf7 8 Nde3 Nf6 9 Be2 Be7<br />7 Qe2 Nf6 8 f3 Nc6 9 Be3 Be7<br />7 d5 Nf6 8 Be3 Be7 9 Qd4 0-0 10 Nd2 c5<br />7 g3 Nf6 8 Bg2 Bg4 9 Qd2 Nc6<br />7 h3 Nf6 8 g4 Be7 9 g5 Nfd7<br />7 h4 Nf6 8 h5 Qf7 9 Bg5 d5<br /><br />There are two dangerous White alternatives on move six:<br /><br />6 Ne3 c6 7 Bc4 d5 8 Bb3 Be6 9 c4 Qf7 10 Qe2 Nf6 11 0-0 Bd6<br />6 Be2 Nc6 7 d5 Ne5 8 0-0 Nxc4 9 Bxc4 Qg6 10 Bb5+ Kd8 (a very good line for White)<br /><br />Right now, the deadliest line for White is:<br /><br />1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 f5 3 Nxe5 Qf6 4 Nc4 fxe4 5 Nc3 Qf7 6 Ne3 c6 7 d3 exd3 8 Bxd3 d5 9 0-0<br /><br />In this line, I think you ought to look at 9...Bc5.  But be sure you have an idea how to survive after 10 Nexd5 cxd5 11 Nxd5 Be6.  If White plays 10 Na4 Bd6 11 c4 Ne7 12 Nc3 there is a new try for Black that Kosten does not mention, namely 12...0-0 13 cxd5 cxd5 14 Nexd5 Nxd5 15 Nxd5 Nc6 16 Nc3 Be5.  The idea is to accept this position down a full pawn and try to draw it.  It's Black's best chance.<br /><br />Some people may try 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 f5 3 Bc4 fxe4 4 Nxe5.  That's a mistake.  They obviously haven't read this book!  You'll play 4...d5 5 Qh5+ g6 6 Nxg6 hxg6.  At this point, White will probably think she's winning.  But after 7 Qxh8 Kf7 8 Qd4 Be6, White generally stands worse.  More likely, White will try something like 7 Qxg6+ Kd7 8 Bxd5 Nf6 9 Nc3 Qe7 10 d3 exd3 11 Be3 c6 12 Bb3 Bh6 13 0-0-0 Bxe3+ 14 fxe3 b6 after which she'll probably get into serious trouble.  Or you may see 7 Qxg6+ Kd7 8 Qf7+ Qe7 9 Qxd5+ Ke8 10 Nc3 Nf6 11 Qg5 Be6, which is good for Black.<br /><br />Of course, White may play 3 exf5, so you may want to look at lines such as:<br /><br />3...e4 4 Ne5 Qg5 5 d4 Qxf5 6 Bc4 Nc6 7 g4 Qf6 8 Nf7 d5 9 Bxd5 Nxd4 or maybe<br />3...e4 4 Ne5 Nf6 5 Be2 d6 6 Bh5+ Ke7 7 Nf7 Qe8 as well as<br />3...e4 4 Nd4 Qf6<br /><br />You also need to know the wild line 3 d4 fxe4 4 Nxe5 Nf6 5 Bg5 d6 6 Nc3 dxe5 7 dxe5 Qxd1+ 8 Rxd1 h6 9 Bxf6 gxf6 10 Nd5 Kd7 11 Nb6 (double check) Kc6 12 Nxa8 fxe5.<br /><br />Against 3 Nc3, just play 3...fxe4 4 Nxe5 (4 Nxe4 Nf6) Qf6 5 d4 exd3.<br /><br />One last line to look at is 3 d3 Nc6 4 Nc3 Nf6 5 exf5 d5 6 d4 exd4 7 Nxd4 Nxd4 8 Qxd4 Bxf5 9 Bg5 Bxc2 10 Rc1 Bg6 11 Bxf6 Qxf6 12 Qe3+ Qe7 13 Qxe7+ Kxe7.<br /><br />If you play 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 as White, you might want to read this just to make sure you take full advantage of anyone who tries 2...f5.<br /><br />I recommend this book for those on both sides of this gambit.3 as White, you might want to read this just to make sure you take full advantage of anyone who tries 2...f5.<br /><br />I recommend this book for those on both sides of this gambit.	2005-02-26

Robert Spencer, Bat Ye'or, David Littman, Ibn Warraq, and the others who contributed the 58 articles in it are to be congratulated.<br /><br />Ibn Warraq begins by explaining that \\"Islam is a totalitarian ideology that aims to control the religious, social, and political life of mankind in all its aspects,\\" and \\"the life of its followers without qualification.\\"  There is a myth of Islamic tolerance generated by various Europeans, and Ibn Warraq gives Thomas Carlyle as an example of a 19th-century European apologist for Islam.  Other articles show more recent examples of disinformation about Islam.<br /><br />By the way, there is no question about what Islam is like today.  There is plenty of variety among Muslims and among Muslim leaders.  And there is a wide variety of literature that can be found in Muslim bookstores.  But anyone who so desires can look over what is in those bookstores and see if it is at all consistent with what Muslim apologists are saying is there.<br /><br />My ancestors abandoned Islam, so I find the book fascinating.  I think that those who are overly uncritical of Islamic totalitarianism are doing no one any favors.  That is especially true of university professors.  Professors are doing us all a service when they defend freedom of speech, but they are being counterproductive if they extend this to defending sedition.  And they are also being counterproductive if they discourage the teaching of material such as what we see in this book.<br /><br />This book discusses the consequences of blasphemy and apostasy, the status of dhimmis, the jizya tax, the lack of freedom and rights for non-Muslims, and the culture of hate that we are witnessing today.  We see how Muslim apologists often label as \\"racist\\" the liberation of people from Muslim servitude.  And we read about the 2001 Durban Conference \\"against\\" racism, which rehabilitated rather than condemned the culture of hatred.<br /><br />There is a section on \\"human rights and human wrongs at the United Nations.\\"  The UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights is quite properly praised; it will be interesting to see if Islamist attacks on it succeed.<br /><br />Bat Ye'or has a superb section where she explains the origin of the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is mainly the result of the trauma inflicted upon Arabs by the emancipation of Jews from their former status as dhimmis.  And she continues with a very thoughtful discussion of Euro-Arab anti-Zionism.  Those who find this topic interesting should consider reading her book \\"Eurabia\\" as well.<br /><br />The book includes Ibn Warraq's excellent critique of the infamous and intellectually dishonest Ed Said, who \\"taught an entire generation of Arabs the art of self-pity.\\"<br /><br />The example of a taunting untruth that impressed me most was that by Arafat at the UN in 1983.  Arafat said that Jesus Christ was the first Arab \\"militant fedayin who carried his sword on the path\\" that Arafat's gang was then on.  Now, I admit that it is interesting to see Jesus depicted as a terrorist thug.  And I did find myself wondering if perhaps he really was the leader of a gang that hijacked the entire catch of fish from a boat on the Kinneret, and robbed a bakery.  But what struck me most about it all was how easy it is to tell that this was no scholarly effort to discern the true nature of Jesus.  Nor was it a clever lie.  It was a taunt.  The purpose of many of the lies we are seeing from apologists for totalitarianism is not to deceive but to taunt.  These statements need to be outrageously false to meet that need.  So we do not have to be geniuses to realize that they are not to be taken seriously.  And we can be confident when we criticize those who parrot such statements as if they were truths.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.d Nations.\\"  The UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights is quite properly praised; it will be interesting to see if Islamist attacks on it succeed.

There is plenty of information about the Temple of Jerusalem in this short book.  We see a plan of the Temple Mount in the time of the Herodian Temple, as well as a plan of Herod's Temple itself.  And we see a plan of the earlier Solomon's Temple.<br /><br />The significance of the Temple is shown through the ages.  We see it the Temple on a Bar Kochba shekel (from the second century AD), with a lulav and and etrog on the other side of the coin.<br /><br />Then we jump to the Christians.  We read a comment from Saint Jerome about Jewish pilgrims to the Western Wall, \\"they are not worthy of pity.\\"  By the way, disparaging comments such as this one were so typical of Christian saints that it may make the word \\"saint\\" more of an insult than a compliment.  In any case, Goldhill explains how the Christians went from an initial conclusion that \\"there was a need for no building\\" on the site of the Temple Mount to a later conclusion that a big beautiful building would be a good idea after all.<br /><br />The author does not forget about the Muslims (my ancestors!) and their connection to the Temple Mount.  And he does discuss the Dome of the Rock.  I found that especially interesting, given that I've been to the Dome of the Rock and even touched the Rock.<br /><br />What's missing from all this?<br /><br />Well, first, I think we're missing a couple of perspectives about the Temple Mount.  The Dome of the Rock is a pretty structure, but it has political significance.  Its words are a direct insult to Christians.  Its location is a direct insult to Jews.  These insults are central in nature: the fact that some Jews and Christians do not feel insulted by it does not change the challenge to Christian doctrine nor the fact that Judaism is a Temple-based religion without a Temple.<br /><br />The fact that the majority of Jews do not wish to rebuild their Temple does not change the fact that some Jews do wish to do so.  And I think that in the long run, those who wish to build a Temple will be very hard to stop.  That will be all the more true if they pick a different location than the Temple Mount, but it may be true in any case.  It is similar to the case of a girl who wants to get married.  Suppose only 14 of the 84 local eligible bachelors want to marry her.  What do you think her chances are?  Awfully good.  If only one out of six (or fewer) Jews were interested in building a new Temple, I suspect they would succeed.  And the book's discussion of the Temple scroll makes it clear that a Temple is by no means a minor or peripheral element of Judaism.<br /><br />So I think the Temple Mount has a potential for being a source of trouble not only in the past and present, but in the future as well.  And this may be true just for nationalistic reasons, not merely for religious reasons.  Not only that, I think that solemn assurances by a few Jewish leaders that the Jews will never rebuild their Temple anywhere would just make matters worse.  I suspect such assurances would just make Judaism look inferior, less trustworthy, and more threatening.<br /><br />Of course, there is another badly missing perspective.  Three of the four most famous Deities associated with this place are simply overlooked.  The Temple Mount in Aelia Capitolina was the site of the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.  I think the author ought to have discussed Them.ll be all the more true if they pick a different location than the Temple Mount, but it may be true in any case.

That is fair and reasonable.  But she should have let her facts speak for themselves.  Instead, she implies that the terrorists are at least as reasonable as those who oppose them.<br /><br />She does mention Baruch Goldstein.  This person was a doctor who committed a terrible and counterproductive crime.  He murdered over three dozen Muslims who were at prayer in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron.  I think we can all understand that this crime did no one any good. And that had someone stopped Goldstein from doing it at the last moment, it is likely that Goldstein would have been very grateful for having been stopped.  I think we can understand that it is proper to call such acts both criminal and crazy.  I think we would be quite properly affronted were we to read sober-sounding apologies for such crimes, perhaps explaining that the Muslims were about to go on a pogrom against Hebron's Jews.<br /><br />I think we ought not have to put up with similar apologies for crimes by Muslims.<br /><br />In this book, it all seems so equal.  Muslims want to kill Jews.  That offends Jews.  Jews want to live.  That offends Muslims.  Both sides are fanatical.  Arabs want 100% of all Jewish land in the Middle East.  Jews want somewhere between 8,000 and 11,000 square miles of land for the more than 5 million Jews of the Levant (in a Middle East where the Arabs have millions of square miles).  Again, it is all so equal!<br /><br />But it isn't equal.  The two sides are trying to do very different things.  And the author obscures this fact.<br /><br />When Arabs attack Jews and children get killed in the battles, the author is proud to show how equal it is.  Both sides are exploiting children to try to gain an unfair advantage.  But that is nonsense.  As even the author shows, the terrorists are targeting children intentionally.  Israel is trying to avoid civilian deaths, for obvious reasons: not only would such murders be immoral, but they would not help Israel.  On the contrary, a policy of targeting Arab children would be suicidal.<br /><br />Davis talks about Mohammed al-Dirrah, a 12-year old Arab who we are told was killed during the 2000 intifada.  Well, he's a great example of Arab propaganda.  But isn't Davis part of the problem?  She has to be aware of the fact that al-Dirrah was almost certainly not killed by the Israelis.  Isn't she aware that the entire incident as shown may well have been staged?  And that quite a few Arab propaganda photos are simply staged?  Why is she so matter-of-fact about it all being equal when we can all see that it isn't?<br /><br />Yes, she does interview some terrorists.  And she reports what they say in a matter-of-fact manner.  But that's not unbiased reporting.  And we all know it.  We can see that like Goldstein, these terrorists are involved in crazy felonies.  We can't deal with this problem unless we can face this reality and avoid blaming ourselves for the craziness of others.  Criminals love to blame their victims.  We ought to resist giving much credence to their claims.<br /><br />Davis does mention Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.  Let's see.  Sharon was a member of the Israeli cabinet who was instrumental in having Israel attack Arafat's terrorist group in Lebanon.  And Sharon did manage to get Arafat and most of his gang expelled from Lebanon.  But there was a slaughter of Arabs at the Sabra and Shatilla camps, and hundreds of people were killed, many of them civilians.  Sharon and the other cabinet members did not realize that this was about to happen and failed to prevent it.  Davis mentions that some Arabs don't exactly have fond feelings for the murderers, who were Lebanese Christians.  Anyway, Davis talks some Arabs who see Sharon as being responsible for the slaughter.  And Davis in no way disagrees with this conclusion.  But I think sheought to!  It is part of the same craziness: the Arab terrorists do not completely ignore the actual killers at Sabra and Shatilla, but they make sure to put most of the blame on those whose rights they wish to take away.<br /><br />The author pulls the same stunt when she comes to the 2000 intifada.  When a terrorist explains that Sharon, by setting foot on the Temple Mount (Judaism's holy site, which happens to be in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel), \\"stepped on holy ground\\" and caused the intifada, that raises a good question.  What if some non-Muslim fanatic explained that he had decided to murder Muslims because a Muslim leader visited the Kaaba?  We'd at once dismiss this as crazy.  Davis instead seems to treat such nonsense with respect, implying that murder was at worst an overreaction to Jews visiting the holiest Jewish site (something Jews had been doing on a regular basis, actually).<br /><br />We do want to know about terrorism.  But we don't need folks pretending that terrorists are being reasonable, or implying that their acts are a predictable reaction to the real crime, namely the existence of their victims.rrorists do not completely ignore the actual killers at Sabra and Shatilla, but they make sure to put most of the blame on those whose rights they wish to take away.

The author of this book doesn't think so.  He says that although we're headed in the wrong direction right now, there are some actions we can actually take to turn things around.<br /><br />Most of us understand the concept of an economic plan.  A family that spends plenty of money has a successful plan if it consistently makes more money than it spends.  It also has a successful plan if it consistently spends more money than it makes, if it has so much capital that it will last for a very long time.  In all this, the family has to measure the true costs and risks involved in its economic decisions, but that is the gist of it.<br /><br />If a family spends more than it makes and runs out of money, it can go bankrupt.  And that can mean being unable to purchase necessities.  It can mean being unable to purchase extremely inexpensive items that had not previously been a factor in one's budget.  And it can mean not being able to spend money on items that will enable one to earn money (or to earn much more money).<br /><br />All this means that we tend to learn about the prices of items and judge purchases accordingly.<br /><br />Well, the same is true for a global economy.  We can run out of resources.  We can use them up faster than we are accumulating them.  And one step we ought to take to prevent this is to measure the true cost of non-renewable resources and of items that do environmental damage that will be costly in the future.<br /><br />Of course, questions of overconsumption become more dramatic as the planet's population goes up.  In times of high population, we need to worry about the costs of fossil fuels, health care, education, computers, food, water, high-meat diets, yachts, jewelry, fine clothes, mansions, and the like not just in terms of the cost in paper money but in terms of effect on our resources and on the environment.<br /><br />As the author points out, the quality of life is going to depend on the population, and we need to control our population to be able to manage a global economy.  He proposes trying to improve education to help stabilize the Earth's population at about 7.5 billion.  But can we maintain such a population without ruining the environment or running out of resources?  If we can't, then human society will be in serious trouble.<br /><br />Brown offers a note of hope.  Although we'll be in trouble if we pursue a course of \\"business as usual,\\" there is a Plan B that could work fairly well.  It consists of stabilizing our population, as mentioned earlier.  And it means raising water and land productivity, as the author explains in detail.  Taking more advantage of drip irrigation alone would significantly increase water productivity.  And we'll want to cut carbon emissions in half in the next ten years.  We'll need to take this seriously, and put our planet on something like a war footing to do it.  We'll need to restructure our tax system, and place a heavy tax burden on environmentally destructive activities (such as fossil fuel burning).  We need to incorporate these ecological costs, and \\"get the market to send signals that reflect reality.\\"<br /><br />And Brown makes it clear that we need to do something soon.  Our global population is already reaching a level that is difficult to maintain indefinitely.  We're seeing the collapse of some fisheries, the melting of glaciers due to global warming, falling water tables, and food shortages in the most populous areas.  Right now, for example, although the Chinese financial picture has been improving, water shortages have caused grain harvests to fall there.<br /><br />If we do something to address the problems Brown discusses here, and do it soon, we may avoid a future in which most of us are poor and miserable.ources and on the environment.   <br /> <br />As the author points out, the quality of life is going to depend on the population, and we need to control our population to be able to manage a global economy.

Stanley won that match to become the first US Champion.  Eight year old Paul Morphy watched as Stanley, as Black, played 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 Ba5 a6! TN 4 Ba4 b5.  The move 3...a6 is now named for Morphy, who became the US Champion in 1857.  We continue with George Mackenzie, who first won the US Championship in 1871.  Mackenzie won in 1874 and again in 1880, when he defeated James Grundy in a playoff match.  Andy Soltis and Gene McCormick tell of the scandal involved, in which Grundy won a game under very dubious circumstances, allowing him to reach the playoff.<br /><br />Then we see champions Harry Pillsbury and Frank Marshall.  And a discussion of Jose Capablanca's claim to the US championship.  Capablanca defeated Marshall in a match 8-1, but was not granted the title of US Champion for a simple reason: he was not an American citizen, but a citizen of Cuba.<br /><br />We then proceed to the 1936 Championship tournament, won by Sammy Reshevsky.  (Amazingly, Reshevsky was still playing in the US Championship when he tied for third in 1981).  And we see the wild 1942 championship, in which Reshevsky was awarded a win by tournament director Walter Stephens, who, in the most outrageous ruling in US chess championship history, forfeited Arnold Denker on time even though Denker's flag was still up (the game should have been a draw).  Reshevsky wound up tying for first after that, and he won a playoff with Isaac Kashdan for the title.  Perhaps justice was served when Denker won the 1944 championship.<br /><br />After that, a new generation took over.  In 1951, 19-year old Larry Evans won the championship, and in 1954, 23-year old Arthur Bisguier won it.  In 1957, 14-year old Bobby Fischer became our youngest champion.  Fischer went on to win all eight of the championships he played in.  We see him scramble out of lost positions in 1959-60 against Robert Byrne and Edmar Mednis (he lost games in later championships to both of them).  We see the 1962-63 championship, in which Fischer finished a game ahead of Bisguier by defeating him on the White side of a Ruy Lopez, Berlin variation.  And there's the incredible Fischer 11-0 sweep in 1963-64, where the commentators thought Fischer was lost in his game with Robert Byrne until Byrne quite properly resigned.<br /><br />We see Walter Browne's championships in the 1970s and early 1980s, as well as the 1978 championship that Browne withdrew from.  And the incident in the game between Leonid Shamkovich and Mednis in that tournament: Mednis lost when he got into time pressure caused by his clock running much faster than any of the other clocks.<br /><br />In the 1987 championship, we see Nick deFirmian tie Joel Benjamin for first place.  Once again, a director's ruling came into play when deFirmian appeared to lose a game on time after his opponent, Michael Rohde, made an illegal move!  The ruling gave deFirmian enough time to reach the time control and win the game.  And we see descriptions of the tournaments through 1996.<br /><br />I liked the more than 100 games in the book.

Turcan's book shows us a great deal about how they worshipped and what rituals they observed.  And this book gives even a secular reader a chance to make some sense of it.<br /><br />Unlike the monotheist god, Roman Goddesses and Gods are perfections of actual attributes.  Romans hailed the Gods and Goddesses casually.  But their rituals were often serious and complex, for they had to instill a sense of the importance of a vow to be worthy of a particular Goddess or God.  And Turcan's book shows us some of these rituals in detail.<br /><br />As Turcan mentions, when the Romans stopped worshipping the Gods and Goddesses, the Roman Empire quickly fell apart.  I think the Christian religion that replaced the Pantheon with a nailed corpse gave Romans little reason to defend their Empire.  The new religion was too nihilistic and atheistic.  Turcan does not appear to agree with me about this, but he does cite Zosimus who did hold Constantine's failure to celebrate the Secular Games in 314 AD to be responsible for the ruin of the Empire.  Turcan also explains that by celebrating the Secular Games, the Romans were in effect \\"taking out a new 'lease' with the gods.\\"<br /><br />This is a scholarly and interesting work.  I recommend it to Pagans and non-Pagans alike.	2005-02-20

This book does indeed make mincemeat out of truth and scholarship.  But the biggest problem it has is not the untruths.  It is the absurd conclusions it draws from them.  Even if Israel were in fact guilty of some of the more absurd things Hurley says, it would still have every right to exist, and Jews would still be human beings who would deserve human rights just like all other human beings.<br /><br />By making a connection between anti-Israeli propaganda and a justification for denying human rights to Jews, books such as this one make it tough on a liberal historian of Israel.  What if a decent and honest person wants to write a history of Israel, and happens to feel like concentrating on Israeli mistakes and on events that make Israel look bad?  That's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.  But now there is a very real threat that such a book could be regarded (especially by those who find a few honest mistakes in it) as anti-Israeli propaganda.<br /><br />Well, there's no risk of that happening to this book.  It isn't good scholarship.  And it opposes human rights.<br /><br />Politically, the book blasts the Likud government of Israel.  That does not bother me.  Even if I were an Israeli, I'd have never voted Likud.<br /><br />Hurley begins with some history of ancient Israel.  And he points out, quite rightly, that there was a problem with the Jewish Zealots.  I tend to agree with him about that.  Matter of fact, I think the Arab suicide bombers of today are at least as wacky as those Zealots.<br /><br />Next, the author explains that many Jews are in the Diaspora by choice and would prefer not to live in Israel.  That is true.  But it is also true that many Jews would prefer to live in Israel, and that they ought to be permitted to do so.  Moreover, Israel is small, so it is anything but greedy for Jews to have sovereignty over all of it.<br /><br />We then see an account of Mandate history.  The British 1939 White Paper is mentioned, but it is whitewashed.  It is not shown how it directly made a state of Israel necessary.  And Hurley insists that there was nothing the British could have done to let more Jews escape from Nazi Europe.  That's false.  They could have done nothing, instead of coming up with the White Paper.  That would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives.<br /><br />There are some untruths about Levantine Arab nationalism in the White Paper era, along with casual misstatements such as the Irgun launching an \\"unrestricted campaign of terror\\" against the British in February, 1944.  The word \\"unrestricted\\" is a manifest falsehood.<br /><br />After this, there is a caricature of the history of Israel's wars, as though Israel's only purpose were to annihilate the Arab people rather than build a state which would defend Jewish rights to life, liberty, and property.  And there is a long section on the Israeli lobby.  This lobby, in real life, is strong because it has an easy product to sell: truth, freedom, justice, and human rights.  It is not as strong as Hurley pretends, but it is certainly stronger than he wishes it were!<br /><br />Of course, Hurley discusses the case of the US ship, the Liberty, which was mistakenly attacked by Israel in the 1967 war.  And he also misrepresents the Pollard spy case.  Pollard broke the law and was sent to prison for it.  Those who complained about what they considered Pollard's relatively severe sentence generally challenged only the plea-bargain aspect of the case, but Hurley doesn't tell us this.<br /><br />Hurley does not come out against those who demand to steal Israeli land, or who demand that Israel make \\"concessions\\" that they would demand from no other nation.  Instead, he tries to confuse the matter by implying that some Israelis are greedy!  Yes, it is true.  Some Israelis are greedy.  Some are chauvinists.  Some are racists.  And so on.  Does he really want to go into this?  Hasit occurred to him that Israel comes out looking very pretty in all these respects when one compares it to its neighbors?<br /><br />Hurley has a chapter where he explains that the Jews have no right to a homeland.  Only the Arabs have a right to Jewish land!  After all, to him, Jews are thieves and Arabs are innocent.<br /><br />The author and those like him are not going to be able to fight the tide of freedom and human rights forever.  Right now, plenty of people are intent on being arbitrary and are trying to make sure that Jews have very limited rights at best in the Middle East.  But it is likely that one day, people will focus on other issues. Jews (and other minorities) will then wind up with their fair share, give or take, just like everyone else.  And that fair share will be less than Hurley says they want.  But it will be far more than they have now, and vastly more than Hurley thinks they deserve.ly want to go into this?

First of all, it begins with a false assumption, namely that Israel's problem is Greed.  With a capital G.  Yes, that must be it.  After all, the Israelis (well, a few of them, anyway) want a vast Empire of over 10,000 square miles!  The author fails to detect the fact that there are over 5 million Jews in Israel.  And even more in the Jewish Diaspora.  That means that Israel can indeed be both a democracy and have a solid Jewish majority, just as Hungary can have a Hungarian majority and the Netherlands can have a Dutch majority.  In short, she fails to notice that Israelis are trying for maybe a quarter or less of what they would have if the world were color-blind, let people buy land, and acknowledged property rights.  And she fails to notice that the Arabs, with millions of square miles, are just a teensy bit on the greedy side in this respect.<br /><br />Next, she seems to imply that the Arabs who are fighting Israel have a positive cause, maybe freedom and human rights.  But if they truly had that as a cause, this war would have been over long ago.  The cause has been, for a century or so, anything but freedom and human rights for Arabs.  It has been the denial of freedom and human rights to the Jews.<br /><br />Bucaille does say that both sides want victory.  But she does not exactly explain what a victory might mean.  Suppose the Israelis did win?  Suppose they got the Big Apology from the Arabs for all the slanders, lies, and aggression?  Suppose they got the Arabs to give up all the incitement, aggression and slander.  Suppose they got the Arabs to live in peace with them.  That's the Big Victory.  Would that be so awful for the Arabs?<br /><br />On the other hand, what if the Arabs get the Big Victory?  Suppose they do get all the Jews in Asia to leave for other continents.  There will be plenty of Jewish survivors.  They'll probably put their lives back together eventually.  Meanwhile, the Arabs will be left with nothing to show for their big crime.  Israel is small.  It has few natural resources.  The only thing of much value is its people.  But all the Jews will leave, and many Arabs may do so as well.  Worse, the Arabs may then try more military adventures.  And just as Germany eventually lost World War Two, the Arabs will lose if they keep fighting their neighbors.  Would this be good for anyone?<br /><br />The book does have some interesting things to say about Gaza.  It's just that it is permeated with anti-Israeli propaganda.<br /><br />Well, what does the author conclude?  She says that real reconciliation between the Arabs and Jews is necessary, unavoidable, and the only rational outcome.  That is an exaggeration, of course.  But only a mild one.  I would say real reconciliation is desirable, likely, and reasonable.  But the problem is that Bucaille does not take her own advice.  She never dreams of a solution in which there is actually Truth and Reconciliation.  Or equal Rights for Jews and Arabs to buy land throughout the Middle East (which might mean that Jews could finally buy land just over the border in Petra and Arabs could buy land in Beersheba).  She does not talk about Jews being allowed to live in Arab lands.  She does not talk about Jews living in Arab nations but voting in Israel or Arabs living in Israel but voting in Arab nations.  She does not talk of having loyalty be a requirement for residents who wish to be citizens with voting rights.<br /><br />I do not recommend this book.be left with nothing to show for their big crime.

The author explains that in the 1960s, Syrians would challenge Israel by shooting at Israelis who lived near the border.  Now, it may be obvious to him that no decent person ought to provoke people by living near a border, but it is not obvious to me.  Actually, what is obvious to me is that such attacks violate property rights and human rights.<br /><br />In any case, Israel would fight back against these attacks by sending tractors into the area near the border.  These tractors would draw Syrian fire, after which the Israelis would shoot back.  Anyway, Bowen explains that the Israelis were not the only people who were violent.  Yes, \\"Israel set the pace, but the Arabs did their best to keep up with the violence.\\"  He goes on to describe Arafat and his gang.  And I think that Arafat more than kept up with Israeli violence!<br /><br />Is Bowen kidding?<br /><br />The author also tells us that \\"Israel has poured money into colonizing the Occupied Territories, violating international law.\\"<br /><br />Actually, the West Bank is disputed territory.  If it violates international law for Jews to spend money there and live there, it violates international law for Arabs to spend money there and live there.  What Bowen is saying is simply false.<br /><br />Oh, but there's worse.  Bowen also explains that Israel can prosper only if the Arabs suffer.  That's preposterous.<br /><br />Is there anyone who might like such a book?  Maybe someone who truly believes that Arabs have a Divine Right, decreed by God Herself, to steal land as long as by so doing, they can deprive Jews of human rights.  Maybe the book will make sense to someone like that.<br /><br />However, if you think truth has value, and if you think peace, justice, or human rights are worthwhile, this book is not for you.	2005-02-19

It makes sense to get this book just to use it to judge other works on the topic.<br /><br />Here is a simple example.  Many people know that hundreds of thousands of Jews fled or were expelled from Arab lands in the past several decades.  But was this a response to Israel becoming a nation?  No.  More than 1000 Jews were killed in anti-Jewish rioting in Baghdad, Tripoli, Aden, Aleppo, Damascus, Oudja, Djerade, and Cairo in the decade prior to Israel becoming a state.  It wasn't Israel that caused this.  As Ben-Gad explains, it was the winning of national independence by Arab countries.  For a couple of generations prior to that, European rule had protected the Jews to some extent.<br /><br />The author summarizes the mistakes of the failed Oslo peace process.  The biggest problem was legitimizing Arafat as a partner for peace and imposing his rule over Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza.  Although Arafat talked about his evil intentions all the time, this was ignored.  Israeli negotiators were inexperienced, were driven by fantasy rather than reality, were too trusting (they assumed that both sides wanted peace), and did not consult the Israeli army.  A very small majority of legislators passed the agreement to sign the Oslo accords, allowing this to suffice was a procedural error in retrospect.  Arafat was incorrectly considered as someone who could crush Arab opposition to peace: using a dictator in such a role would have been a moral and strategic error even had Arafat wanted to do all this. The agreements made a mockery of Israeli laws and red lines, giving many of Israel's opponents the feeling that they could get Israel to agree to absolutely anything.<br /><br />There were other big problems with Oslo.  One was that once the agreement was signed, Israeli negotiators went far beyond anything that the Israeli public or voters would have agreed to.  This could not have happened had the main issues been decided at once, rather than left to the end of the process.  Worst of all, Israel was expected to keep its promises while the Arab side was not required to.<br /><br />To his credit, Ben-Gad notes that the Israeli settlements promote peace.  There can be no peace if we all agree to something so arbitrary as to ban Jews from the West Bank while allowing Arabs to live in Israel proper.  A couple of hundred thousand Jews live in the West Bank, and by doing so, they legitimize the right of over a million Arabs to live in Israel proper.  The author points out that the West Bank is not occupied territory but disputed territory.<br /><br />What about the proposed \\"Road Map\\" for peace?  The author has some concerns about it.  The biggest is that it will not stop incitement against Israel.  That alone will preclude peace.<br /><br />I'll mention a few of the author's other concerns with the Road Map.  It will reward terrorists and give them a state from which to operate.  It will freeze West Bank Jewish settlements but not West Bank Arab ones.  That will concede the West Bank to the Arabs: if Jews do not have the right to move there, they certainly do not have the right to be sovereign there.  With all these concessions, the issues left to the end will be about how the division of Jerusalem is to be accomplished and how many Arabs will be allowed into Israel (confirming that the purpose of a new Arab state is to serve not as a place Arabs can move into but one Arabs can use to destroy Israel).  In addition, the Road Map will use international conferences to put pressure on Israel to make immoral and counterproductive concessions to terrorists.<br /><br />Many on both sides of this conflict regard it to be about the fate of Israel, which both sides see as very important.  I think both sides are wrong.  Israel is not all that important, after all, it is small.  But it would set a dangerous precedent for everyone on this planet for the international community to arbitrarily give in to irredentist terrorist demands to deprive Asian Jews of their rights to life, liberty, and property.<br /><br />I recommend this book.nal community to arbitrarily give in to irredentist terrorist demands to deprive Asian Jews of their rights to life, liberty, and property. <br /> <br />I recommend this book.	2005-02-19

Through the development of the country, and all the politics.  It's wild.<br /><br />At the age of 16, Sharon enrolled in a special course to train squad leaders for the Haganah.  He did not do very well in it, and became only a \\"probationary corporal.\\"  Still, he did a superb job in the 1948 War of Independence and in 1953, he gained fame as the leader of a commando unit.  He explains how he trained the soldiers physically and made them learn the terrain extremely well.<br /><br />One thing that made a big impression on me was his discussion of a big mistake.  In 1973, he was ordered to attack a strong Egyptian position.  The order turned out to be an error, based on a misreading of a battle map.  But Sharon was not able to get the order rescinded, so he obeyed it.  Plenty of people died needlessly as a result.  It was a very serious error.  As we readers can see, Sharon ought to have asked Moshe Dayan to get the order rescinded, but didn't do that until he was ordered to repeat the attack later.<br /><br />As Sharon explains, warfare commanders need to be on the battlefield to see what is happening.  He saw \\"a company of tanks disappear in a minute,\\" and \\"an entire battalion was engulfed and destroyed before they had time to report that they were being hit.\\"  I realized upon reading all this how tough it is to keep track of what is happening during a battle.<br /><br />Of course, there are daring and brilliant actions in the book, not just mistakes, such as the crossing of the Suez Canal in the 1973 war.  And it was a brilliant political decision not to allow a multinational force to step between Arafat's thugs and Israeli forces in Lebanon.  Such a force would probably have allowed Arafat to stay in Lebanon and use it as a terrorist base.  But when Israel turned down this idea, Arafat was forced to leave Lebanon or die.  He chose to leave.<br /><br />There is some discussion of the development of towns in the disputed West Bank.  It shows a practical attitude towards them.  Still, I couldn't help but notice that allowing both Arabs and Jews to live on this disputed land is highly moral.  It is not unusual for the moral choice to be a good tactical and strategic choice as well.  A further example is given by Israel's plans to invade Lebanon in the first place.  That invasion accomplished plenty, but not nearly as much as it would have had Gemayel not been assassinated.  When Israel was contemplating the invasion in response to attacks from there, US Secretary of State sent Prime Minister Begin a letter \\"urging Israel to exercise 'complete restraint.'\\"  Sharon reports Begin's answer:  \\"Mr. Secretary, the man has not been born who will ever obtain from me consent to let Jews be killed by a bloodthirsty enemy.\\"<br /><br />There is a discussion of the massacres at Sabra and Shatilla, and the Kahan commission, which found that while Sharon was not complicit, he bore \\"indirect responsibility\\" for what had happened.  Sharon feels that this ruling was absurd and harmful.  I'm not so sure it was absurd (although probably incorrect).  But it certainly was harmful.  It is proper to hold armies to high standards, but catastrophic to try to go beyond that.  Armies that are not allowed to do their job of defending people and property will soon be replaced by military forces that at least try to do that job.<br /><br />I can see many aspects of the damage.  The Israeli army was left without a lesson, having quite properly done its best to stay out of an area just to avoid getting in trouble.  Even today, many opponents of human rights point proudly to the Kahan commission to pretend that the Israeli Prime Minister is a war criminal (after all, it did say something about Sharon being responsible)!  Time Magazine became emboldened into printing a sillylibel about Sharon having planned the slaughter with the Lebanese (Sharon sued Time and won).<br /><br />When Sharon ran for Prime Minister, I was one of many people who thought he might fare poorly in a primary election.  I had a hunch that accusations of war crimes, although bogus and foreign, would be a bad thing to have on one's resume, even if one were a politician.  My hunch was wrong, and I now realize that the Israeli electorate showed what it thought of these accusations.<br /><br />I recommend this captivating book.into printing a silly libel about Sharon having planned the slaughter with the Lebanese (Sharon sued Time and won).  <br /> <br />When Sharon ran for Prime Minister, I was one of many people who thought he might fare poorly in a primary election.

It seems to me that if they are actually committing terrorist acts, they are criminals and it seems to me that those who donate money to help them in their criminal endeavors are accessories.<br /><br />In 1992, journalist Steven Emerson happened to attend a meeting of the Muslim Arab Youth Association (MAYA) in Oklahoma City.  He was surprised to find a large amount of anti-American, anti-Jewish, and anti-Christian propaganda there, as well as speakers from Hamas and other terrorist groups.  But he was even more surprised to discover that the FBI had no mandate to investigate this.  But as the FBI expalined, it was merely hateful rhetoric, wasn't it?<br /><br />Emerson decided to find out just how much more was going on than mere hateful rhetoric.  And he found some material which was broadcast in a 1994 television program, \\"Jihad in America.\\"  The program did win some awards, but Emerson was now surprised to discover the intensity of some of the more outlandish denials of parts of his program by various Muslim groups.<br /><br />Since then, many of the rest of us are the ones who have been surprised by the seriousness of the problem.  No, there is no plan of a coup that will take over the government.  But we've seen terror within our borders, with the most notable being the attacks on the World Trade Center.<br /><br />This book traces the infiltration of the United States by Hamas and other terrorist groups.  It tells about the University of South Florida and the now notorious Sami al-Arian, who was allowed to remain at the university for years in spite of his terrorist activities.  While there may be a question about who knew exactly what al-Arian was up to and how much they knew, the important fact is that America was a very easy place to infiltrate.  Too easy.  America served as an ideal location for terrorist group command and coordination activities.<br /><br />That leads Emerson to a discussion of al-Qaeda, as well as his ideas about how we can fight back against the terrorists.<br /><br />One of the most interesting parts of the book is the appendix that lists nine radicalized groups that \\"provide significant support for terrorist organizations,\\" namely MAYA, AIG, ICW, CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations), AMC (American Muslim Council), ICNA (Islamic Circle of North America), MPAC (Muslim Public Affairs Council), AMA, and ISNA, and briefly summarizes their activities.<br /><br />I recommend this book.ctivities. <br /> <br />That leads Emerson to a discussion of al-Qaeda, as well as his ideas about how we can fight back against the terrorists. <br /> <br />One of the most interesting parts of the book is the appendix that lists nine radicalized groups that \\"provide significant support for terrorist organizations,\\" namely MAYA, AIG, ICW, CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations), AMC (American Muslim Council), ICNA (Islamic Circle of North America), MPAC (Muslim Public Affairs Council), AMA, and ISNA, and briefly summarizes their activities. <br /> <br />I recommend this book.	2005-02-17
346814:US	53071109	R173OKA9IIPKYH	0300098391	370805337	The Christians as the Romans Saw Them	Books	5	12	22	N	N	The Romans, as the Christians see them	This book is well written.  And the author really attempts to be fair.  Yes, it could have been much, much better.  But I think it is still worth five stars.<br /><br />I think the book does give the reader a little bit of insight about what the Roman Pagans thought of the Roman Christians.  But I don't think it comes close to showing the huge gap between the two groups.  Moreover, given that Christians of today tend to be very reasonable, I think the reader might not realize how great a contrast there is between today's Christians and Christians of a much earlier time.<br /><br />Let me give an analogy that Wilken avoids.  Many non-Muslims feel that there is something wrong with a belief that if a man becomes a martyr, he'll enjoy 72 virgins in Paradise after death.  And they also see such a claim as part of a very intolerant attitude towards others.  On top of that, they see some statements about the West issued by the most fanatical Islamists not as great and wise truths, nor even as silly lies, but as vicious and intentionally absurd taunts.  I happen to think that this is a good starting point for thinking about how quite a few Roman Pagans really saw the Christians.<br /><br />Still, Wilken does not completely miss the fact that many Romans realized that the battle between Pagans and Christians was not about truth, and that the Christian side generally opposed truth as a matter of principle and saw no reason to deny it.<br /><br />Wilken begins with Pliny, and questions of what Christianity was.  Was it a club, like the Nicomedian firemen?  Did they have wild and unacceptable rituals, like the followers of Bacchus?  Anyway, some folks found the Christians in their town objectionable.  Wilken guesses that \\"they were scornful of the traditional worship and gods; they made converts chiefly among lower classes, rejecting efforts to discuss their religion with educated people...\\"<br /><br />In fact, I think that early Christianity did indeed appear to exclude any educated or intelligent people.<br /><br />The author explains that neither Pliny nor Emperor Trajan wanted to hunt down Christians.  And they pardoned any Christians who repented.  They also rejected anonymous accusations against Christians.<br /><br />But Pliny did note two things about Christians.  One was their superstitiousness, that is, their irrational attitudes about their deity, which they saw as arbitrary and capricious.  The other was their \\"hatred of mankind.\\"  I think this criticism hits the nail on the head.<br /><br />Galen is the next author Wilken discusses.  Galen also noted that the Christian deity was arbitrary and capricious, and whimsical as well.  And he saw that the Christians appealed to \\"faith\\" rather than reason.  Today, this complaint may seem mild.  Back then, I am sure that it amounted to an undenied accusation that Christians hated truth.<br /><br />The author mentions Saint Augustine (I call him \\"gus\\").  gus did say in \\"City of God\\" that the Romans were not really religious.  But Wilken, to his credit, says that the Romans really were religious and thought of themselves as religious.<br /><br />Wilken then writes about the works of Celsus.  Celsus pointed out several problems with Christianity, One problem was the absurd and self-inconsistent claim that the Christian god came down to earth, for no apparent purpose, to live among men.  Another was the Christian claim of the resurrection of the dead.  A third problem was Christian worship of Jesus instead of worship of the one and only god the Christians claimed existed.  Celsus also deplored the idea of making a big hero out of Jesus, who was a very ordinary person at best.<br /><br />Next we get to Porphyry, whose works were destroyed by the Christians.  It seems that Porphyry scared the Christians to death.  Wilken asks why.  And he concludes, quite reasonably, that Porphyry did not merely reject Christianity but gave convincing arguments in favor of Polytheism.  I agree.  And I alsothink that Porphyry must have exposed the Christians as the atheists they were (and still are).<br /><br />Wilken explains the power of Porphyry's demonstration that the Book of Daniel is not prophecy but history, and that Christians were totally misinterpreting it in any case.<br /><br />The final person Wilken deals with is Emperor Julian.  Julian made it illegal for Christians to be teachers of Pagan works.  He said that it would be fine for Christians to teach the New Testament; that was a Christian work.  But it would be impious for Christians to teach the works of Pagan scholars.<br /><br />Anyway, as we now know, the Christians did indeed defeat Roman civilization and in the end taunted their defeated foes by calling the Pagans enemies of truth.  But whatever problems the Pagans may have had, I think this was outrageous, coming as it did from a gang that had spent its entire existence openly hating truth.  I feel that Wilken in no way gets across the horror of the Christian victory over civilization.  But I still recommend this book.and still are).

Three dozen people contribute their perspectives on these topics.<br /><br />The book consists of the best presentations from the first Jerusalem summit, held in October, 2003, in Israel's capital.  That summit focused on developing a moral and efficient alternative to the failed Oslo process and mapping out ways to bring democracy and freedom to the Middle East.<br /><br />Here are some of the points from the summit:<br /><br />1)  US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is a good idea, and might at least remind people that Israel is here to stay with Jerusalem as its capital.<br /><br />2)  The present international bodies designated to protect international law have sunk into immorality, corruption, and inefficiency.  The UN is morally bankrupt and can not function as the instrument of justice; alternatives must be considered.<br /><br />3)  Ultimately, Arabs must liberate themselves from their irredentism.  But we Westerners can help by not leading them towards more of the same.<br /><br />4)  For the first time in history, nihilists will actually have the means to match their ends.  That means that civilization is indeed at stake.<br /><br />5)  Panting for peace with terrorists merely makes terrorists the masters of the situation.  What we need to do instead is defeat the terrorists.  Otherwise, the only way we'll get \\"peace\\" is to let the terrorists do whatever they please with us all, \\"peacefully.\\"<br /><br />6)  Peace can be accomplished only by facing the truth.  Those of us who are for human rights and justice need to go out and support it with our words at the very least.  We are speaking the truth.  We have nothing to be ashamed of.  Let's do it!<br /><br />7)  A new Levantine Arab state would be a bad idea.  It would be a terrorist state, and it would endanger Israel (and maybe Jordan as well).  And it would have absolutely no moral or historical justification.<br /><br />8)  Israel must neither rule over a million Arabs nor cede them complete sovereignty within the borders of the 1930s British Mandate.<br /><br />9)  Israel is not a foreign occupying power in Yesha.  Thus no international law prevents Israel or its citizens from establishing civilian towns on state lands.<br /><br />10)  Israel in 1967 did not \\"occupy\\" a Levantine Arab \\"nation.\\"  University professors ought to be the first ones to point out this obvious lie.  But for the most part, they haven't.<br /><br />11)  There can't be peace if anti-Jewish incitement doesn't cease, and that includes the force-feeding of propaganda to schoolchildren.<br /><br />There are several proposals for peace in the book.  They emphasize the need to separate the combatants.  A typical and excellent idea is to let Arabs vote in Jordanian elections and Jews vote in Israeli elections, independent of which side of the border they might actually live on.<br /><br />While I don't agree with all the ideas in this book (a wide variety of ideas are covered here), I find them all interesting, valuable, and sincere.<br /><br />Some people may assume that this book is of no use, because a majority of the people in the world disagree with what it says.  They may consider the contributors to be a political fringe.  And on some issues, they may be right.  But when a political fringe tells us the truth, or requests sanity rather than arbitrariness, that fringe will be proved correct in the long run.

So let me focus on how poorly this book deals with that nation.<br /><br />It starts by explaining that the Arab-Israeli conflict is the result of competing nationalist agendas.  Even this is misleading, given that the Israelis are not trying to get rid of the Arab nations, while the Arab foes of Israel are trying to get rid of Israel.  We then are treated to a statement about how sad it is that both Jewish and Arab nationalism appeared at the same time, and that this is why they fought.  Well, they did not appear simultaneously.  Arabs had been oppressing Jews for centuries.  When some Jews became liberated, that annoyed some Arabs, but a desire to get rid of Jewish rights is not the same as nationalism.  Israel became a nation in order to defend Jewish rights (and, in particular, to repeal the British White Paper of 1939, which almost completely restricted Jewish immigration to the Levant).  If a Levantine Arab nation comes into existence, even now, it will be explicitly to get rid of Israel, not for some positive purpose.  That is not true nationalism.  It is a bogus claim of nationalism, such as the one made by the Sudeten Germans in the 1930s.<br /><br />The authors continue by saying that Levantine Arabs stood in the way of Jewish nationalism.  That is misleading.  In fact, many Arabs happily sold their land to Jews in the region (at very high prices, of course).  The presence of Arabs in no way needs to stop Israel from existing, just as the presence of Catholics in no way needs to stop America from existing.  There is not an inherent need to expel all Arabs or all Jews from Israel, just as there is not an inherent need to expel all Catholics or all Protestants from the United States.  Arabs and Jews can both live in a Hebrew-speaking nation.<br /><br />The book then gets into the area of \\"founding myths.\\"  Once again, it does poorly.  When it deals with Israeli desires for human rights, it tends to group that with \\"myths\\" that may serve a purpose.  When it deals with Arab claims to be blameless bystanders to a war of aggression that they started, it tends to group these with \\"myths\\" that may serve a purpose.  Instead, the focus ought to be on truth.<br /><br />The authors boast that in 1988 Arafat literally delivered an olive branch to the UN General Assembly.  So what?  His gang was still fighting a war against Jewish rights.  If I give an olive branch to the UN General Assembly, do you suppose the authors will support my, um, right to take over the Levant in the name of the Roman Pagans who were displaced from it?<br /><br />The authors discuss the intifada and the reporting of it, and wonder whether it has brought peace any closer.  And they imply that the media did a good job.  But in fact, the media happily showed PLO propaganda more often than not, and also gave this propaganda undeserved credibility.

The Jews, considered subhuman by some Arabs, have demanded their rights as humans!  And some people have allowed this to happen.  In particular, Israel supports human rights for Jews.<br /><br />Well, this has been too much for some Arabs, so they have been fighting a war to strip Jews of their rights.  And in this book, we hear some stories by those Arabs who have been hurt in this war.<br /><br />I tend to sympathize with all the victims in wars.  That includes Americans, Japanese, Germans, English, Soviets, and others in World War Two.  But my sympathy does diminish somewhat when those who ask for it outright couple such requests with demands for revenge, theft, and murder.<br /><br />The author basically blames the Jews for all the ills of the region, whether they are responsible or not.  In this book, the Arab aggressors are blameless.  As for Israeli defence against Arab aggression, well, that's bad!  It's dehumanizing!  Pearlman fails to note that the alternative to defending oneself might be even worse, for everyone.  The alternative is to get killed and to enable one's killers to cause even more carnage.<br /><br />The truth is that if the Arabs were to call off their war against Jewish rights, they would be better off.<br /><br />The book tells us that Israel is defying UN resolutions and human rights charters!  Well, these claims are made by foes of human rights who insist on denying human rights to Jews in particular.  Is this a double standard?  You bet it is.  Pearlman ought to be noting the arbitrariness of anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist UN resolutions.  Instead, she's boasting about them!  And she goes on to say that Israel has committed a \\"grave injustice\\" against the Arabs.  That Arab land has been stolen.  She tops it by blaming the Arab suicide bombers on the Jews.  And then she says that the only solution is justice!<br /><br />I agree with Pearlman that we need justice.  And I have a suggestion here.  Imagine that you didn't know who you were.  That you might be Arab or Israeli. Muslim, Pagan, Christian, Jew, or other.  Young or old.  Female or male.  Hebrew-speaking, Arabic-speaking or other.  Healthy or sick.  Poor or rich.  Landowner or nonowner.  Suppose you had to find a solution that treated everyone equally, and didn't give special favors to anyone.  What would you do then?<br /><br />Hopefully, one would demand the same rights for everyone, and not demand less rights for oneself or more rights for oneself.  Hopefully, one would not praise racism, theft, and aggression, as this book does.<br /><br />I know that this book is misleading and dishonest.  And that it opposes justice, human rights, and peace.  But there is another problem with it that I would like to address.  Namely, it seems to assume that if some rather militant folks complain enough, everyone will give them whatever they want, even a right to steal and kill.  Well, I don't believe that.<br /><br />I think some Arabs are under the misimpression that the Jews, especially the Levantine Jews, unfairly got something really, really good by complaining about what happened to them in World War Two.  Um, have a look at how the British government treated them in 1945, 1946, 1947, and 1948.  Plenty of people react negatively to complaints, justified or not.  Herzl was one person who felt that asking for sympathy was both dishonorable and futile.  And I tend to agree with him to a large extent.<br /><br />In any case, I think the Arabs would have a far better case if they did what Herzl and the Zionists actually did, and tried to focus on positive accomplishments.  Instead, books such as this one are part of a dubious plan to do what some Arabs wrongly imagine the Zionists to have done.That you might be Arab or Israeli. Muslim, Pagan, Christian, Jew, or other.

Herzl was one person who felt that asking for sympathy was both dishonorable and futile.  And I tend to agree with him to a large extent.      In any case, I think the Arabs would have a far better case if they did what Herzl and the Zionists actually did, and tried to focus on positive accomplishments.  Instead, books such as this one are part of a dubious plan to do what some Arabs wrongly imagine the Zionists to have done.	2005-02-15

In square C8<br /><br />(d)  On square a6<br /><br />If you said that it starts out on a8, moves to a6, and then sails towards the kingside on the sixth rank, then get this book.  You won't be rooked!<br /><br />This is an excellent book about the Budapest Gambit (1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e5).<br /><br />My primary defence against 1 d4 is the Semi-Slav.  But I've used the Budapest a couple of times as a second-string defence and won with it both times.  So I was eager to see what Lalic has to say about it.  He says it is playable.<br /><br />I've always suspected that the Budapest is not really sound.  But Lalic supplies answers for all of White's serious options.  After 3 dxe5 Ng4 (Lalic also analyzes 3...Ne4, the Fajarowicz gambit), White has plenty of possible moves:<br /><br />4 Qd4 d6 5 exd6 Bxd6<br /><br />4 Nc3  Nxe5 5 Bf4 Nbc6<br /><br />4 e6  Bb4+  5 Bd2 Qf6<br /><br />4 e4 Nxe5 5 f4 Nec6<br /><br />4 e3 Nxe5 5 Nh3 g6<br /><br />4 f4 Bc5 5 e3 d6<br /><br />The Budapest Castle variation starts with 4 Nf3 Bc5 5 e3 Nc6.  White used to get an advantage with 6 Nc3 0-0 7 Be2 Re8 8 b3 Ngxe5 9 Bb2 Nxf3+ 10 Bxf3 Ne5 11 Be2.  But then Black started playing 11...a5! 12 0-0 Ra6 (this is the infamous Budapest Castle).  Black seems okay after that.<br /><br />That leaves 4 Bf4, White's most dangerous move.  Lalic gives several ideas for Black here.  One is 4...Bb4+ 5 Nd2 d6, which is risky but merits a look.  The best idea is 4...Nc6 5 Nf3 Bb4+ 6 Nbd2 Qe7 7 e3 Ngxe5 8 Nxe5 Nxe5 9 Be2 0-0 10 0-0 and now Lalic claims Black can equalize with either 10...Ng6 or 10...d6.  I think it requires plenty of work to play either of these moves against a prepared opponent.<br /><br />Just in case you are thinking about trying the Budapest and your previous main defence to 1 d4 has not been 1...Nf6, there is something really fundamental you need to know!  Half the time, White won't let you play the Budapest!  You'll find yourself on the Black side of 2 Nf3 or even 2 Bg5.  Against 2 Bg5 (the Trompowsky) you can play 2...Ne4 and reply to 3 Bf4 with 3...d5 or 3...c5, but neither are the Budapest!  Meanwhile, 2 Nf3 is a total transpositional swindle.  You'll probably wind up in a Queen's Gambit Declined after 2...d5 or in some sort of Indian defence!  Here, I play 2...e6 and after 3 c4 (if I don't want a Semi-Slav) I settle for a Queen's Indian with 3...b6.  My choice is not between the exciting Budapest or the dull Queen's Indian.  I have to know the Queen's Indian either way.  The Budapest is my alternative to the Nimzo-Indian.<br /><br />I recommend this book.pest!

It is over 1000 pages, not even counting the index or the huge bibliography.<br /><br />Sachar's idea is to tell us what happened and why.  That does not mean taking sides.  It does not mean saying if the people involved were reasonable or moral in choosing the sides they did.<br /><br />I can understand this approach.  We all wish that we could always view relatively current events from the perspective of those who could see which side was being greedy, which side was simply immoral, or which side was being impractical.  But we can't, so Sachar simply reports what happened as best he can.  And I don't see how I can ask for more than this.<br /><br />In addition, the simple retelling of what happened and why tells us plenty about how wise or moral decision-makers were.  Let me give one example.  Sachar has a hefty section on the response to the UN Partition Resolution of November, 1947.  Britain refused to gradually transfer authority to a United Nations commission, explaining that this would result in \\"confusion and disorder.\\"  Britain did everything possible to avoid cooperating with those in the UN or the Jewish Agency.  The six UN commission members were made unwelcome.  They \\"were soon reduced to foraging for food and drink.  They accomplished nothing.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, the British Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, simply regarded the Jews as enemies.  As Sachar writes, Bevin claimed \\"that the whole Jewish 'pressure' was a gigantic racket run from America,\\" that the Jews had stolen \\"half the place\\" (that is, half of the Mandate territory), and that \\"he would not be surprised if the Germans had learned their worst atrocities from the Jews.\\"  I think this ought to tell any perceptive reader plenty about Bevin.<br /><br />On top of this, Sachar explains that Bevin and some important British officers were predicting an Arab military victory, and that the Arabs would have no difficulty taking over the whole country.  Nowadays, some people appear to have forgotten all this and are pretending that everyone knew that the Arabs would be no match for the Jews, which is yet one more reason why we ought to read this book!<br /><br />Sachar also tells us about the British swiping the entire contents of the Mandate treasury, to make sure the Jews got none of the money.  At the same time, the British gave 300,000 pounds to the Supreme Moslem Council, an indirect subsidy of the Arab war effort.  The British strictly enforced an embargo on Jewish immigration and Jewish weapons acquisition.  Meanwhile, the British happily sold weapons to Iraq and Transjordan.<br /><br />It is true that on April 1, 1948, the Jews decided to stop responding to Arab attacks in a purely defensive manner.  With Jerusalem threatened, they did decide to take action to relieve the siege.  But Sachar has already shown us that one reason the Jews were unable to try such a plan before then was that the British would have stopped them by force.<br /><br />There is an enormous amount of information in this book.  I recommend it to everyone who is interested in the topic, no matter what political views they may have.ome people appear to have forgotten all this and are pretending that everyone knew that the Arabs would be no match for the Jews, which is yet one more reason why we ought to read this book!

You see, human beings will, if given the chance, tend to buy land in the places they wish to live in.  The ones who can make best use of the land and wish to do so will be the high bidders for the land.  If injustice consists of stealing that land from them and justice consists of letting them buy the land and keep it (which they will wish to do if they are offered only low prices for it), then it is easy to see what the triumph of justice would mean here.  In particular, it would mean a prosperous Israel and a triumph for Zionism.<br /><br />Shlaim appears to have missed all this.  To him, Zionism is unjust.  And to him, the triumph of terror and theft is both forthcoming and desirable.  He tells us that a new independent Levantine Arab state \\"is inevitable.\\"  I disagree.  It may be likely.  But it would serve no purpose.  It would not help Jews, Arabs, or others.  Its only purpose would be to damage Israel.  The people of such a state do not as yet have an independent language, religion, culture, cuisine, or foreign policy.  So I think there is still hope that sanity may prevail here.<br /><br />Shlaim also tells us that this new Arab state will be \\"weak, demilitarized, and territorially divided.\\"  Is it just possible that this, if true, provides even more reasons why neither side might want to create it at all?  And could that make the appearance of this state even less inevitable?  Or at least less desirable?<br /><br />And the author also explains that both sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict will have to make \\"painful compromises,\\" and that Jerusalem will have to be \\"the subject of hard bargaining.\\"<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />Is having peace and prosperity with reasonable borders a painful compromise?  For either side?  Of course not.  Shlaim is kidding us if he expects us to believe that war, poverty, and destruction are somehow less painful.<br /><br />Had Shlaim been writing about France and Germany, we'd have seen at once that the whole viewpoint is nonsense.  He'd have been telling us that the German National Socialists needed an independent state in France, either to replace all of France or part of it.  He would have laughingly dismissed French claims on the basis of the entire idea of France being unjust!  He'd have sternly explained that a German National Socialist state in France was both desirable and inevitable.  And he would have discussed the necessary \\"painful compromises\\" for both sides and the \\"hard bargaining\\" about Paris.<br /><br />There are plenty of reasonable books about the Arab war against Israel.

But which road is it in the middle of?  War on one side, with peace on the other?  Western nations on one side and Arab nations on the other?<br /><br />Maybe the author ought to have read Dante, who said that the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in times of great moral crises, maintain their neutrality!<br /><br />One example I am familiar with is the Arab war against Israel.  In this case, the Arab side feels that it has a right to get rid of Israel.  That is why the Arabs became the aggressors in the first place.  But the author doesn't seem to agree.  Maybe such a statement would seem politically incorrect.  So instead, we get the explanation that some people think the Arabs are the aggressors, some think the Israelis are the aggressors, and some simply see it as a cycle of violence.  And this latter explanation is allowed to look plausible.<br /><br />In fact, if Arab aggression were to stop, that would produce peace.  No matter who is right and who is wrong, Israel would have to be suicidal to fight against neighbors that were willing to live with it in peace.  And Israel is not suicidal.<br /><br />To back up this midde-of-the-road attitude, Davis says that in Jenin in 2002, both sides behaved badly.  Unfortunately, Jenin is one case where Israeli forces were at their best and at their most justified.  Saying otherwise is simply misleading the reader.<br /><br />Davis also indicates that a fundamental solution of the conflict is for Israel to give away its claims on the West Bank to the Arabs, and to render that region Judenrein.  He fails to tell us that the West Bank is in fact disputed territory, and that for Israel to do this would be equivalent to having France donate Alsace and Lorraine to Germany and ethnically cleansing the region of all Francophones.<br /><br />I'd rather see some accuracy and honesty than this ill-advised attempt at political correctness.	2005-02-13

One of the most enjoyable openings you can play is the White side of an Open Sicilian (1 e4 c5 2 Nf3, followed by 3 d4).  The strategic ideas are clear and there are plenty of grandmaster games to use as examples.  Your pawns fly down the board to open lines.  And your challenge is to find the most efficient squares for your pieces.  Some people want to avoid the Open Sicilian on the grounds that the lines are too complex.  Don't be one of them!  I think the lines are far tougher for Black than they are for White.<br /><br />Emms starts by reminding us that if you play 1 e4, you'll see 1...c5 half the time.<br /><br />There is one little problem with 2 Nf3 and 3 d4 of course.  You just gave away your d-pawn for Black's c-pawn.  As Emms warns us, if you don't play aggressively, you should lose.<br /><br />This book should give you an idea of which lines you'll feel comfortable with as White.<br /><br />The first system we see is the Dragon.  Emms introduces the Yugoslav attack, the Classical Variation, the Levenfish attack, and 6 g3 (personally, I think that unless you play the Yugoslav or the Levenfish, you might as well not play an Open Sicilian).  In the Yugoslav, as Fischer said and as Emms reminds us, you pry open the h-file (with your h-pawn) and then \\"sac, sac, mate!\\"  And, of course, you trade your trashy queen bishop for Black's gorgeous Dragon Bishop.  In the Yugoslav, Emms shows us 9 Bc4 and 0-0-0.  You may also want to investigate 9 g4.  I also like the Levenfish, which is very easy for White and very tricky for Black.  In it, you blast away at Black's position with 7 e5.<br /><br />The next chapter is on the Najdorf.  What do you do with your Queen Bishop now?  Emms shows us two popular ideas.  In the Main Line (6 Bg5), that Bishop just gets in your way, so you save time by exchanging it for the Black Knight on f6.  In this line, Emms covers 10 g4, but you may want to look at 10 Bd3 as well.  The other option is 6 Be3, with the idea of an eventual Qd2.  Before you decide to try this, play over the game Emms shows where Black plays 6...Ng4.<br /><br />Chapter 3 is the Scheveningen, where you have several good choices: 6 g4 (the Keres attack), 6 Be3 (the English attack) and 6 Bc4 (the Fischer attack).  I happen to prefer the latter, because I think it gives me the best chance of finding something useful for my Queen Bishop to do.<br /><br />Next is the Sveshnikov.  Here, Emms gives us the choice of 9 Bxf6 or 9 Nd5.  9 Bxf6 gxf6 10 Nd5 f5 is why I do not play the Sveshnikov for Black.  I think 11 Bxb5 and even 11 Nxb5 are very dangerous for Black.  But no matter what White plays, Emms explains that she has to figure out what to do about her pathetic horse on a3.<br /><br />After that, the author introduces us to the Richter-Rauzer attack and the Sozin and Velimirovic attacks against the Classical Sicilian.  The Velimirovic attack is especially fun to play for White.  You castle queenside, play Rhg1, g4, g5, and mate Black with your major pieces.<br /><br />That leaves us with five other Open Sicilians (Emms does not show us the O'Kelly variation, namely 2...a6, so just learn 3 c3 against it).  They are the Taimanov (where 5 Nb5 is the most interesting), the Accelerated Dragon (where White's Queen Bishop is so classy that she may not even want to trade it for Black's dragon bishop), the Four Knights Sicilian (not popular for Black due to her isolated queen pawn), the Kan, and the Kalashnikov.<br /><br />The Kan gives both sides great flexibility.  This is an excellent choice for Black against a novice, as the best lines for White are slow and positional.  If you are White, you simply have to learn how to play the Maroczy Bind against it.<br /><br />The Kalashnikov is the only Sicilian system that I am willing to play as Black.  Emms shows that both sides have plenty of options.  Play is more positional than tactical.  Again, White should play c4 with a Maroczy Bind, to prevent d5 by Black.  And now it is Black who is trying to trade her worthless king bishop for White's Queen Bishop!<br /><br />For those who want to play the Sicilian with Black (or who want to avoid 3 d4 with White), Emms concludes with the four best White alternatives: 3 Bb5, 2 c3, 2 Nc3, and 2 d4.  By the way, I've actually seen people get into these via 1 Nc3 c5 2 e4 and even 1 c3? c5 2 e4.<br /><br />I recommend this book.  If you don't yet play the Open Sicilian with White, this book ought to add at least 100 points to your rating.k.

Hanson discusses the war against terror, the Middle East, American support for Israel, Anti-Americanism, changes in Europe, the war against Iraq, and a few other topics.<br /><br />In many cases, the author's observations are controversial.  And I often disagree with him.  On the other hand, some of what Hanson says is clearly true.  And most of what he writes is worth thinking about.<br /><br />I find Hanson's ideas about NATO and the United Nations intriguing.  He asks why we should house NATO in Brussels, given Belgium's \\"anti-American rhetoric.\\"  He says that Warsaw or Rome would be better.  And he thinks France ought to be forced to decide whether it is in NATO or out of NATO: it ought not be both.<br /><br />As for the UN, he has a number of ideas that might help reform it.  First, he would expel the tyrannies from it: these nations could form their own \\"United Tyrannies.\\"  And he would include India, Japan, and Brazil as permanent members of the Security Council.  He would also \\"quit allowing functionaries like Kofi Annan or Boutros Boutros-Ghali\\" to have leadership roles in the UN and instead pick \\"real statesmen and moralists of free countries, like Vaclav Havel or Elie Wiesel.\\"<br /><br />Hanson is also at his best when he discusses the media in wartime.  As he puts it, \\"would NPR reporters have visited Hitler's Germany, paid bribes to Mr. Goebbels, and then broadcasted allied shortcomings at the Bulge, oblivious to the Nazi machinery of death and their own complicity in it?\\"<br /><br />I have to agree with Hanson about this.  Yes, we want the media to tell us the truth.  And that certainly does not mean blindly accepting the propaganda our government comes up with.  But even less does it mean blindly accepting the propaganda tyrannical enemies come up with.  The easiest way for journalists to lose freedom of the press is to cede it by allying themselves with our enemies.<br /><br />On the topic of Israel, the author shows the inanity of anti-Israeli arguments as they are presented today.  The main arguments against Israel are that it is \\"occupying\\" Arab land (actually, it is doing no such thing: the West Bank and Gaza are disputed territories), that it has displaced and even killed Arabs in wartime (as if other wars never displace or kill anyone), and that it is racist (as if the Arabs were not much more so).  These arguments are so absurd that Hanson rightfully takes them as taunts, not as serious propositions.  Hanson then ascribes support for Arab anti-Zionists as due to \\"realpolitik,\\" oil, fear of Arab terrorism, antisemitism, and \\"aristocratic guilt.\\"<br /><br />As I said, Hanson is simply picking low-hanging fruit by saying this.  It is like pointing out that an emperor is undressed.  But I still have to give him some credit for doing so./>On the topic of Israel, the author shows the inanity of anti-Israeli arguments as they are presented today.

It does address one aspect that many people overlook, namely the significance of Israel to many Western Christians.  The book does supply some counterarguments from Arab Christians.<br /><br />Rydelnik quite properly identifies Arab antijudaism as a major cause of the conflict rather than an effect of it.  And he gives examples of Arab propaganda that show how serious this problem is.<br /><br />It seems to me that the author is quite accurate in describing the history of this quarrel.  However, I did find a statement he makes that's incorrect: he says that Winston Churchill named Haj Amin el-Husseini as mufti of Jerusalem, but I think the one who appointed the mufti was actually Herbert Samuel.<br /><br />The most interesting parts of the book are the chapters on Israeli and Arab claims to Israel.  Rydelnik breaks these claims down into the following categories: religious, historical, political, economic, and human rights.  He gives arguments and rebuttals for both sides for each of these categories.<br /><br />I find the religious claims untenable for either side.  And I think the arguments ignore the fact that the land is the site of Temples of Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, Aphrodite, and many other Goddesses and Gods.<br /><br />I also think the historical claims are invalid for both sides.  No one would hand Hungary over to the Welsh today just because some Welsh people may have lived there long ago.  But I do think that what Rydelnik calls \\"memory of the land\\" does explain why many Jews wanted to purchase land in the Levant and live there.  In addition, there's more to it than mere memory: Jerusalem was the active capital of the Jewish people when Modern Zionism began in the late 1870s, and it already had a Jewish majority (perhaps the only Asian city to have one).  In short, I think this argument at best shows good faith on the part of most Jewish purchasers of land.<br /><br />Part of the historical argument is that both sides were displaced from the land and have a right to return to it.  I think this is nonsense as well.  The Jews who owned the land 2000 years ago are long dead.  So are almost all the Arabs who owned it 60 years ago (Arab children in 1948 were not owners, their parents or grandparents were).  The Jews and Arabs who left the land did not pay property taxes on it.  They did not develop it.  Their heirs never owned that land.  Nor is it even clear just who their heirs are.<br /><br />Next come the political arguments.  I reject claims that the Balfour Declaration gives Jews a right to visit the Levant, settle there, or own property there.  But the League of Nations really did give Jews that right.  On the other hand, it did not give Jews the right to their own state.  And as near as I can tell, no nation has ever been given a right to exist, anywhere.  Nations exist, that is all there is to it.  Israel exists because the British White Paper of 1939 made it necessary if Jewish rights to life, liberty, and property were to be preserved.  When Israel became a state, it replaced a colonial British mandate, just as Ghana replaced Gold Coast.  It did not replace an Arab state.  Furthermore, individual Jews bought Levantine land legally, and at high prices.  They have a right to keep that land if laws are to be worth anything.  That is not a political argument but a legal one, and I think it is decisive.<br /><br />Some Arabs say that those who want to destroy Israel have a Right of self-determination and a Right of return.  I find this absurd, just as I would find it absurd for Arabs to declare a Right to destroy the United States and \\"return\\" to it to expel the present inhabitants.  So I dismiss most of the political arguments.  However, I do recognize the fact that Israel does exist now.  And that it would be a horrible and arbitrary crime and a horrible precedent to destroy it.<br /><br />The next category of arguments is economic.  The author dwells on the improvements Israelis have made to the land, and the improvements in the economy.  I think this is a valid argument.  If people are to bid for property, the high bidders will win it.  If those who are making the most effective use of the land actually have it, they may well be the highest potential bidders.  That would make it counterproductive to award the land to others.<br /><br />The final arguments are about human rights.  I think human rights are a good idea in themselves.  Israel has promoted them, while Israel's Arab opponents have attacked Israel mainly to oppose human rights (at least to oppose human rights for Asian Jews).  And I think it is relevant that the existence of Israel supports human rights and is thus a benefit for everybody.  Rydelnik lets the Arab counterarguments speak for themselves.  These include claims that Jews are lying about the severity of the genocide in Europe in World War Two, and that the Arabs are totally innocent bystanders who are paying a price for the fact that Jews fared poorly in Europe in that war.  Such claims are very weak and amount to no more than taunts.<br /><br />I recommend this book, even for those who share neither my religious views nor the religious views of the author.and the improvements in the economy.  I think this is a valid argument.  If people are to bid for property, the high bidders will win it.

Israel has promoted them, while Israel's Arab opponents have attacked Israel mainly to oppose human rights (at least to oppose human rights for Asian Jews).  And I think it is relevant that the existence of Israel supports human rights and is thus a benefit for everybody.  Rydelnik lets the Arab counterarguments speak for themselves.  These include claims that Jews are lying about the severity of the genocide in Europe in World War Two, and that the Arabs are totally innocent bystanders who are paying a price for the fact that Jews fared poorly in Europe in that war.  Such claims are very weak and amount to no more than taunts.    I recommend this book, even for those who share neither my religious views nor the religious views of the author.	2005-02-11

Is it really that good?  As far as I'm concerned, yes, it is.<br /><br />That does not mean that those who want to learn something about the genocide in Rwanda ought to read this book and no others!  But this book ought to be one of the ones that you do read.<br /><br />Gourevitch explains that there really was a carefully planned genocide, in which about 800,000 of Rwanda's 900,000 Tutsis were slaughtered in about 100 days, decimating (reducing by 10%) the population of the country as a whole.  He shows that many rather ordinary Rwandans carried out these murders, often with machetes.  And there are a number of individual stories that make it all horrifyingly real to us readers.  Although I often dislike an anecdotal approach to events, I think Gourevitch does a superb job with it.<br /><br />There are numerous issues that beg to be discussed, and Gourevitch addresses them.  He shows how the genocide was planned, he describes how it was accomplished, and he shows the extent of retaliation for it.  Throughout, he manages to keep his moral compass.  He properly dismisses excuses by the killers that there was nothing they could do, or that they were merely following orders, or merely giving orders.  Nor does he try to make the intentional attempt to get rid of all Tutsis equivalent to incidents in a war to conquer or liberate parts of Rwanda.<br /><br />Some of the issues Gourevitch raises deal with responsibility of other nations.  Where was the UN in all of this?  Or France?  Or the United States?  He points out that there is a Genocide Convention whose premise is \\"that a moral imperative to prevent efforts to exterminate whole peoples should be the overriding interest animating the action of an international community of autonomous states.\\"  Germany was indeed conquered in 1945, its leaders were brought to justice, the country was then reconstructed.  Does the international community have the same attitude about similar threats today?  Obviously not.  In fact, France tended to support and arm the Hutu killers.  The United Nations never obtained the authority to try to stop any of the atrocities.  And the United States helped delay sending more UN forces, so that even had the UN decided to try to take action, it would have been unable to do so at the height of the massacres.<br /><br />Rwanda is an overwhelmingly Catholic nation, and I wondered about the role of the Church in the genocide.  After all, the killers and victims tended to be of the same religion.  It was disappointing to discover how little the church leaders did to speak out against the killings, let alone stop them.<br /><br />Of course, reading about such terrible inhumanity does make one wonder about our species as a whole.  Are we humans really this awful?  Well, yes, sometimes we are.  But this book also left me with a feeling of hope and a sense that we can do much better.  I think the book made me realize that if we were to show just a little more respect for truth and human rights and pay just a little more attention to events, we would be likely to avoid tragedies such as this one.imilar threats today?

The Israel Defence Army was officially created on June 27, 1948.  But its precursor had already been fighting a war for the previous six months.  And its origins were even earlier.<br /><br />As Allon explains, the first cells were formed as early as the 1880s.  During the period between the World Wars, Arab pogroms led to the development of the Haganah.  This army was founded in the 1920s, but began to acquire some skill with the arrival of Orde Wingate in the Levant in 1936.  Wingate and Yitzhak Sadeh developed the Haganah into a force that turned the military situation around, so that the Arab attacks ground to a halt in 1939.  Unfortunately, at that time, the Jews suffered a major diplomatic defeat.  The British came up with the infamous White Paper which severly restricted Jewish immigration, and that put the Jews into a virtual war with Great Britain.  In addition, the Jews faced threats from Germany and its allies as well as from Arabs.  To counter all this, the Jews in 1941 formed an additional strike force, called the Palmach.<br /><br />Allon describes how the new army trained and how decisions were made to avoid open warfare against Britain and also to avoid terrorist attacks on civilians.  Instead, the focus was on illegal (according to the White Paper) immigration of Jews.  This activity required planning and coordination: it required ground forces as well as ships.  The author explains that this experience helped prepare Israel for its war of liberation, which began on November 30, 1947.<br /><br />Allon then tells about the War of Liberation and the Sinai campaign of 1956.  He explains that peace was averted after the 1956 war primarily due to the efforts of the United States, which forced Israel to withdraw from the Sinai but did nothing to restrain the Arab side.<br /><br />The author then explains the rationale in favor of Israel going to war against the Arabs in 1967 as a preventive measure.  Allon successfully argued against this.  As a result, Israel decided not to go to war unless its neighbors concentrated their forces in clear preparation for an attack or closed the Straits of Tiran (a clear declaration of war).  Egypt did the latter, starting the Six Day War.  Allon argued for an attack in May, before the Egyptians could organize their Sinai forces, but for political reasons, the strike was postponed until June.<br /><br />The author points out that Israel was slow to attack Syria, with the result that Southern Syria remained in Syrian, not Israeli hands.  Had Israel forced Syrian forces back to the outskirts of Damascus, the Israelis might have been able to link up with the Druze people and help them form their own buffer state.<br /><br />The book concludes with over 150 pages of fascinating documents about the origin and early exploits of the Israeli forces.<br /><br />If you are interested in this topic, I'm sure you will find this book very rewarding.ns the rationale in favor of Israel going to war against the Arabs in 1967 as a preventive measure.

And suppose I showed that the Mafia broke the law sometimes, and even went so far as to say that the Mafia was more interested in its cause than in being law-abiding!  And suppose that, in an effort to be fair, I also explained that the real problem happened to be those who had the temerity to go after the Mafia and try to bring those in the Mafia to justice.  Well, if I did that, I would expect some criticism.  And Fisk got some when he explained that the PLO was more interested in its cause than in Lebanon.  And he got more when he simply condemned Israeli responses to PLO attacks out of hand.  As well as when he dismissed such criticism as Israeli propaganda.<br /><br />Fisk mentions in his book that journalists in Lebanon started to get some criticism for their unbalanced and inaccurate reporting.  As he admits, \\"Slowly, but with ever-increasing frequency, the Israelis suggested that we were anti-semitic.  Like Hitler and Arafat.\\"  Well, I don't know if some of the critics he mentions, such as Conor Cruise O'Brien and Martin Peretz, actually quite said that.  But O'Brien and Peretz did write about Lebanon and the reporting from there, and O'Brien and Peretz were basically right, while Fisk is basically wrong.  Of course, Fisk says it is the other way around.<br /><br />Part of Fisk's problem is political.  That is, he feels it is a counterproductive crime to attack terrorists who have been murdering one's people and who promise to do more of the same.  He does realize that some people will attack terrorists anyway.  But I think he fails to realize that we ought to expect terrorists to be attacked and that it is a good idea to try to stop terrorism.  Still, that is just a political problem.  The bigger problem is his misrepresentation of the victims of terror, and his misleading reporting.<br /><br />Is this book good enough to be worth a star?  Not really.  But I couldn't find a way to give it zero stars.  Just avoid it.h a star?  Not really.  But I couldn't find a way to give it zero stars.  Just avoid it.	2005-02-09

Yes, the book may appear anti-Hutu.  But that is because so many of the Hutus were guilty of genocide.  The fact that not all Tutsis have always been angels does not change that.<br /><br />Rwanda is a country of a little over 10,000 square miles, with several million people.  At the beginning of 1994, about ten percent of its people were Tutsis and almost all of the rest were Hutus.  There were about 900,000 Tutsis.  In the space of a few weeks, 800,000 of the Tutsis were brutally murdered, many of them by their neighbors, who generally used machetes to slaughter them.  This was a carefully planned extermination.  There was a long period of incitement.  And even the word \\"inyenzi\\" (literally, \\"cockroaches\\") used by Hutu extremists to describe Tutsis started as a reference to violent armed men who tended to move at night.  It was not merely a term of derision, but also one which helped produce a reaction of fear that encouraged the massacres.<br /><br />The author explains that had it not been for the success of a Tutsi army in eventually (but too late) taking the capital city, the leaders of the genocide probably would have gotten away with it completely.  There might have been a brief and partial UN boycott, with France discreetly violating it, followed by a restoration of international ties with the government.<br /><br />The differences between Tutsis and Hutus had made a big impression on European colonialists a century earlier.  The Tutsis were usually considerably taller and thinner than the Hutus.  The Tutsis typically had narrower noses and lighter skins as well.  Europeans had put Tutsis in control of the land in spite of the fact that the Hutus were a big majority.  However, when Rwanda obtained independence, the Hutus gained control and the Tutsis were almost entirely unrepresented in the government or military leadership.<br /><br />Although most of the Tutsis in Rwanda were killed, several hundred thousand Tutsis who lived outside Rwanda moved into that country when the Tutsi army gained control of it.  And well over a million Hutus fled Rwanda.<br /><br />Prunier makes many interesting points.  One is that although many people claimed that the Tutsis were much richer than the Hutus, the average incomes of Tutsis and Hutus were about the same.  Another is about the role of France in supporting the Hutus.  There is a revealing quote of a French minister who was asked about this and gave a very unconvincing denial: \\"Me!  Accuse me of having got people to train death squads!  Let's be serious!  In all these crises some people always find a way to attack France.\\"<br /><br />When some French troops finally showed up in the area, the Hutus applauded them in a big way.  Radio announcements told Hutu girls to \\"wash yourselves and put on a good dress for our French allies.  The Tutsi girls are all dead so you have your chance.\\"<br /><br />These sorts of things, along with some amazing official French comments about the Hutus and Tutsis killing each other, as though there were simply victims and no criminals, make it appear that France was a big part of the problem.  The United Nations forces, with their instructions not to stop any of the atrocities, were worse than useless.<br /><br />I learned quite a bit from this book.

358786:US	53071109	R2H9FLM4CIKSAW	1857443594	995042880	Starting Out: Minor Piece Endgames (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Minor pieces	Anyone who plays chess in tournaments generally has acquired some knowledge of endgames.  But how much?<br /><br />Well, in my experience, one learns the most about rook endgames.  That means that most tournament players know all about getting one's rook to the seventh, keeping one's rook active, getting it behind a passed pawn, and winning won endgames with rook and pawn against rook.<br /><br />But what about the endgames in this book?  What if you have only a minor piece versus pawns, or a piece and pawn against a pawn?  Or if you have one or two extra pawns where each side has a knight, or bishops of the same color, or bishops of opposite colors?<br /><br />Well, there is one lucky case: everyone knows what to do with a bishop against a bishop of the opposite color and one pawn.  The rest of it is what one has to learn, not just so that one will be able to play these endgames but so that one will know whether to try to aim for one of them during a game.  I think many tournament players are surprisingly weak at just these endgames.<br /><br />I think Emms does a good job.  This book is quite readable for any chess player.  And there are also 32 good exercises, with detailed solutions at the end of the book.  It should go a long way towards bringing readers up to speed on these positions.<br /><br />Did Emms omit anything I would have included?  Yes.  Emms never gives either side more than one piece.  So we don't see two bishops against a knight or two knights against a bishop, with or without pawns.  We don't see the basic mates with bishop and knight against a king, two bishops against a king, three knights against a king, or the instructive two knights versus king and pawn.  Still, I think these are minor omissions.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.	2005-02-07

Its theme is on what you can do to help, rather than on how you can allow apathy, revenge, fear, bias, or false hope to make you part of the problem.<br /><br />In negotiations, the author recommends showing respect for the other side, recognizing perceived injustice, believing in forgiveness, bonding at the emotional level, recognizing values that are opposed to you own, desisting in belligerent actions, avoiding ideological talk, and avoiding passing judgment (and especially in making others out to be Wrong).  And, most important, confronting the underlying factor of fear, the single most important element in conflicts.<br /><br />While I don't always agree with Chopra, I think these points are always worth considering.<br /><br />Chopra also discusses the role of religion.  He says that religion must place responsibility for violence in the mind of every person.  That it must stop judging others negatively for being outside the faith, it must stop defending war, it must stop claiming to be the only True Path, it must give up its arrogance and claim to authority, it must renounce its covert greed and desire for power, and it must discover how to return love to its place of primacy.  Again, I think that while he is demanding quite a bit here, we all ought to think about this.<br /><br />The author also discusses how terrorists are created.  His seven step recipe: group pressure, secrecy, an atmosphere of fear, a hierarchy that demands obedience, a nearby authority that makes cruelty a duty, permission to disregard morality, and no threat of punishment for evil deeds.<br /><br />Chopra notes that many very sweet people actually enable violence by refusing to oppose it.  There are numerous reasons for this but a key is false hope.  That enables victimhood, it serves as a mask for denial that there is a problem, it papers over conflicts, and it causes many people to suffer in silence.  One example of this is the hope many of us had for peace in the Levant when Rabin shook hands with Arafat.  But as Chopra points out, nothing positive happened from this pretence of friendship.  \\"Conflicts are not resolved when two parties walk away with residual animosity.\\"  I may not fully agree with Chopra here, but I think he's on the right track.<br /><br />The author says that in the short run, we see Islamist terrorists boasting that their violence has helped get their coreligionists to \\"rise up\\" against some presumed oppressor.  But he explains that the truth is that \\"governments everywhere are rising up against\\" the Islamists.  And he gives Beslan as an example.  Here he gives us some friendly advice.  We may be tempted to call support for terror \\"evil.\\"  That's not always the best idea.  Many people do support terror and most do not think they themselves are evil.  We won't be very convincing if we call them evil.<br /><br />Instead, Chopra encourages to speak to these people, but change the subject from \\"evil\\" to \\"chaos.\\"  While it may be difficult to see which side is evil, it is much easier to see if specific strategies will simply lead to chaos.  And it is easy to argue that chaos is counterproductive and that it is a poor idea to promote it.<br /><br />While the author does not give us much advice on exactly what to do about violent aggressors who insist on bullying us, I think he makes some really good points about how we all can help.  If those of us who refuse to stop thugs physically would simply support those who are against aggression instead of making excuses for the thugs, I think we'd be making plenty of progress.  In any case, the key is to react soberly.  \\"The world has become a better place because of the dominance of reason over irrational impulse.\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book.when Rabin shook hands with Arafat.

Our land?  Our wealth?  Our system of government?  Our people?<br /><br />All of the above?<br /><br />I think it is striking that all over the world, so many talented people want to join our American adventure.  We're a nation dominated by immigrants, relatives of immigrants, and friends of immigrants.  And I was very interested in what a talented immigrant would say about the nation he's joined.  D'Souza is, of course, a politically conservative immigrant.<br /><br />The book begins with a discussion of the destruction of the World Trade Center.  The author points out that the terrorists were fanatics but not cowards (they did die to do all that damage).  And that these fanatics do not like America, they do not like the American way of life, and they are willing to die to destroy our nation and to deprive us of our rights.<br /><br />D'Souza explains that antagonism for America can be summarized as European complaints about our arrogance, Asian complaints about our lack of culture, and Muslim complaints that the whole idea of America is a subversive threat to Islam.  And indeed, he says, the existence of the term \\"unamerican\\" (given that no one uses terms such as \\"ungerman\\" or \\"unpakistani\\") tends to confirm this.<br /><br />There is a chapter on colonialism.  The author makes four points about Western colonialism: the West did not invent colonialism, its colonialism was not the cause but the result of its wealth and power, colonialism eventually (if unintentionally) increased the wealth of the colonized lands, and colonialism (again unintentionally) introduced the language of freedom and human rights to colonized areas.<br /><br />D'Souza also explains that America is unusual in that birth does not determine destiny.  Anyone can pick virtually any profession to try to excel at.  Couples who wish to marry can do so in spite of their status at birth.  Of course, a downside for many immigrants is that their children become assimilated.  Actually, I think assimilation is a plus, though (I'm a liberal, you see).<br /><br />The next issue the author takes on is racism in America.  There is a discussion of the history of slavery in the United States and its repudiation after the Civil War.  And there is the question of affirmative action.  The author believes that test score differences between, say, \\"Asian-Americans\\" and \\"African-Americans\\" are genuine, but that they have temporary and cultural causes that can be readily overcome, not genetic causes.<br /><br />Now, what about American foreign policy?  D'Souza does address the fact that we have often supported dictators of various sorts, including Somoza in Nicaragua and Stalin during World War Two.  And we're sometimes wrong, even tactically, to do so.  But he points out that we do much more good than bad overall.<br /><br />Is the conflict between American society and militant Islamism a battle between two equally counterproductive ideas?  Not according to the author.  At the end of the book, he reminds us that our society produces folks who are \\"confident, self-reliant, tolerant, generous, and future-oriented.\\"  That compares favorably with being \\"wretched, servile, fatalistic, and intolerant.\\"  And the latter is what militant Islamism is producing.<br /><br />This is an interesting book, and I recommend it.come assimilated.

Of course.  We've seen the effect on the German population in the 1930s.  And on many others.  Now we're seeing the effect on the Levantine Arabs.<br /><br />Of course, that's not the way this book describes it.  Instead, it analyzes the meaning of the Arab struggle against human rights as seen by some of those who are caught up in it.  And it sympathizes with their irredentist cause.  There were some authors who described the emergency in Germany that way as well.<br /><br />Collins quite properly implies that truth, justice, and human rights are worthwhile and valuable.  But his heroes are opposing all this.  Now, what will happen when one day, those who oppose human rights lose?  Their cause is intrinsically counterproductive, so they can't win.  Eventually, those who oppose human rights will be defeated by those \\"enemies\\" they seek to oppress: either foreign or domestic.<br /><br />One day, there will be peace in the region.  Maybe some Truth and Reconciliation as well.  And maybe even equal rights for all people in the area.

One that comes to mind is the Dreyfus case in France in the late nineteenth century.  Dreyfus was a Jewish military officer who was accused of treason.  Although many people doubted his guilt, a crowd of folks still celebrated his dismissal from the army and severe prison sentence on Devil's Island.  And they shouted \\"Death to the Jews.\\"  That made a big impression on Theodore Herzl and on many other folks.  Why should all Jews be attacked just because one Jew may be a felon?<br /><br />On top of that, it turned out Dreyfus was innocent.  Where did that leave the anti-Dreyfusards?  Well, it showed them to be opponents of human rights who did not care too much about justice or truth.<br /><br />And that's where the author of this book is.  She's supporting the modern version of the anti-Dreyfusards.  And in this book, the most obvious example of this is the Mohammed al-Dura case, which some of you may have heard of.<br /><br />This was a case at the start of the 2000 intifada, where newspapers printed pictures of a 12-year old boy who they claimed was caught in a crossfire between Arabs and Israelis and who died in the arms of his wounded father.  Once again, quite a few people blamed the Jews without looking at the evidence and drew the conclusion that there needed to be group punishment on the Jews for letting such a thing happen.<br /><br />Campbell uses her journalistic skills to support the modern anti-Dreyfusards.<br /><br />Now, it is true that people do get hurt and killed in wars.  And it is true that while Arabs terrorists have targeted Jewish children and Israeli defenders have not targeted Arab children, some Arab children have indeed died at the hands of Israelis.  However, Israelis have frequently been blamed for deaths they did not cause, or that never happened.<br /><br />I am not proposing to let Israel off the hook for any instances of wrongdoing.  On the other hand, I refuse to let various Arab terrorists and their United Nations supporters off the hook for their wrongdoing.<br /><br />It is also important to realize that staged performances are a way of life in the intifada.  Plenty of anti-Israeli material is staged for the viewing audience.  Campbell ought to have warned her readers about this, but instead, she simply became part of the problem.<br /><br />The truth is that it is very unlikely that Israelis killed al-Dura on purpose.  It is unlikely that the Israelis killed al-Dura at all.  And it is quite possible that the entire set of photos and movie shots were simply staged.  Had Campbell wanted to be fair and objective, she would have realized that the verdict of history would be likely to vindicate the Israelis.  And that the numerous instances of attacks on Israel to \\"avenge\\" al-Dura were in part caused by a perversion of journalism such as what she was about to display.<br /><br />That makes the author's reporting on al-Dura just another piece of propaganda in the war against human rights.<br /><br />Truth does not depend upon where one stands.  And truthful history will not treat books such as this one kindly.<br /> <br />I am not proposing to let Israel off the hook for any instances of wrongdoing.

After all, it states that \\"Israel invaded\\" Bethlehem \\"on April 2, 2002, and besieged the Church of the Nativity.\\"  What could be more objective and unbiased?<br /><br />Well, just about anything would have been more objective.  After all, the problem wasn't the Israeli soldiers.  It was a gang of Arab terrorists who, um, invaded the Church of the Nativity in order to try to get away with their crimes.<br /><br />Still, I did have an obvious question.  Just how complicit were the Christians with the Arab terrorists?  Were they hostages?  If they were, I would have hoped that the Vatican would have complained more loudly about it.  Or were they siding with the thugs?<br /><br />Hammer explains that the Christians offered the Arabs \\"sanctuary\\" in the church.  And that the terrorists could keep their guns.  It's nifty how the author thinks he can excuse everyone.  The terrorists were just trying to find well-earned sanctuary.  And the Church can't be blamed for supporting the Human Rights of all thugs!<br /><br />Well, I think such a whitewash has the opposite effect.  I know some very decent Arab Christians.  But when I see stuff like this, it makes it difficult for me to sympathize with them.  I know that many people have been pressured into siding with (or at least tolerating) the thugs.  But there is no excuse for open support of terror.<br /><br />As a minimum, every reputable Christian leader should have unambiguously denounced the takeover of the Church of the Nativity and should have supported Israeli efforts to arrest the terrorists and bring them to justice.  But instead, the author tries to explain that such an idea was impossible, given the untrustworthiness of the Israelis.  And he blames Israel for allowing Jews to live in the West Bank at all!<br /><br />I happen to think that the Israelis were quite trustworthy.  But such an issue was separate from the fact that thugs were occupying the Church of the Nativity.  Would we have been so slow to denounce an occupation of the Kaaba by Christian terrorists?<br /><br />I do not recommend this book.  Its bias is so great that it is hard to trust what it says anyway.tivity.

Jews spent plenty of time and effort draining swamps and making the deserts bloom again.  They didn't do that as a joke.  They wanted to be allowed the human rights of life, liberty, and property in their homeland.  And live in peace there.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some Arabs are fighting a war against the Jews.  And people are getting hurt and killed in this war.  But the authors don't ask for the aggressors to call off their war against human rights.  Instead, they blame it all on the Jews.<br /><br />One of the chapter headings discusses the foundations of \\"Israel's impunity.\\"  The authors appear to wonder how Israel can get away with trying to defend its land and its people.  And they have it all figured out!  Listen to this:<br /><br />\\"The answer lies in part with Israel's ability to manipulate human rights and humanitarian law and the UN bodies responsible for overseeing compliance.\\"<br /><br />Wow.  You sure could have fooled me.  I always wondered why the UN invited a notorious terrorist, Arafat, to lecture it in 1974.  And why it came up with an embarrassingly inane resolution that Zionism was a form of racism in 1975.  I wondered why the UN spent half its time defaming Israel instead of doing something useful or productive.  Was it a big Israeli plot to get the UN to do all that?<br /><br />And have you noticed that even Israel's capital city, Jerusalem, is special?  The international community recognizes the capitals of other nations.  But most don't recognize Jerusalem.  Is that yet another example of Israeli manipulation?<br /><br />No, all these things were done by those who, um, manipulated the UN to defame Israel and to discriminate against it.<br /><br />Of course it is sad to see the book's shameless and absurd propaganda.  But it somehow makes me wonder about those who are doing the complaining.  Given all the demonization of Israel in the UN, just what is it that the authors want?  If all this anti-Israeli bias isn't good enough for them, I can hardly imagine what their reaction would be were the international community to suddenly become color-blind and give everyone, even the Jews, rights to life, liberty, and property.<br /><br />Meanwhile, two generations of Arab youth have been propagandized to damage society rather than trained to help it.  And books like this are simply part of the problem.what their reaction would be were the international community to suddenly become color-blind and give everyone, even the Jews, rights to life, liberty, and property.

364523:US	53071109	R2TO220FFOFKV8	1857443217	394967910	Starting Out: the Ruy Lopez (Starting Out - Everyman Chess)	Books	5	24	25	N	N	A valuable introduction to the Ruy Lopez	This is an excellent book about the Ruy Lopez (1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5).<br /><br />It is for a range of players, but it is primarily for those who want to learn something about one of the most important openings in chess.  And that includes near-beginners.  It teaches the reader some of the characteristics of the opening, so that one can get a feel for how one would like to play it for White or Black.  And it has plenty of recent games as examples.  Shaw starts by telling us that if Black doesn't do something to stop it, White will simply play 0-0, Re1, c3, and d4 to dominate the center and bring her Queen Knight to the Kingside (from b1 to d2, f1, and g3).<br /><br />In the chapter on third-move alternatives for Black, the book concentrates on the Berlin Defence (3...Nf6) and the Schliemann defence (3...f5).  The Berlin Defence is popular these days (World Champion Kramnik has played it frequently) and it often gives Black a good endgame, so it merits plenty of space.  The Schliemann is not a very sound line.  However, the problem is that Black may play it anyway.  Tame White responses generally give Black a chance to castle, play d6, and then launch a dangerous kingside attack.  Aggressive play by White leads to complicated lines.  So this is where Shaw quite properly spends some valuable pages.<br /><br />Then there is a section on the Exchange Variation with 3...a6 4 Bxc6 dxc6 5 0-0.  That's a good idea because White may very well want to play it, if only to avoid all the later defences.  In addition, White generally gets an easy endgame out of it.  This is a valuable line to learn for both sides!<br /><br />Yes, Shaw barely mentions 3...a6 4 Ba4 d6 5 c3 f5 (the wild \\"Siesta Variation\\").  That's fair.  He recommends 5 0-0 here, and it is unlikely that you'll get into it from either side.<br /><br />Next comes the Open defence with 3...a6 4 Ba4 Nf6 5 0-0 Nxe4 6 d4.  This is a popular and very instructive line for Black, so it gets a few games.  Right now, White has been doing well against it, but that could change as defenders do a little more studying.  Here, Shaw mentions that Black can almost get away with 6...exd4 (the \\"Riga Variation\\").  This is an unsound but wild line that might even deserve an illustrative game.<br /><br />There are seven games covering two very interesting sixth-move sidelines after 3...a6 4 Ba4 Nf6 5 0-0 b5 6 Bb3, the Archangel defence (6...Bb7) and the Moller defence (6...Bc5 or 5...Bc5).  These are very active defences, so White will be in trouble if she faces one of them unprepared.  And, of course, since they are active defences, plenty of club players will be playing them.<br /><br />Now we come to the Marshall attack (3...a6 4 Ba4 Nf6 5 0-0 Be7 6 Re1 b5 7 Bb3 0-0 8 c3 d5 9 exd5 Nxd5 10 Nxe5 Nxe5 11 Rxe5).  This is a very dangerous countergambit for Black, and it used to be very popular among club players and grandmasters.  It is still popular, but less so, given that most folks with White (including Kasparov) now opt for the anti-Marshall with 8 a4.  The Marshall is given four illustrative games.  In all of them, Black plays 11...c6.  Maybe 11...Nf6 (a weaker move) deserved at least a mention, since it is dangerous too, but it did not get one.  I was glad to see the line with 11...c6 12 d4 Bd6 13 Re1 Qh4 14 g3 Qh3 15 Re4 included, along with the claim that Black can force a draw with 15...g5!  16 Qe2 f5 17 Bxd5+! cxd5 18 Re6 f4!  The Anti-Marshalls also get four illustrative games.<br /><br />That leaves only 19 games (out of 80 in the book) for the main line closed Ruy (3...a6 4 Ba4 Nf6 5 0-0 Be7 6 Re1 b5 7 Bb3 d6 8 c3 0-0 9 h3).  And I think that is the proper balance.  Main lines are worthless if one does not understand what to do if they are avoided.  We see the four most popular versions: the Zaitsev (9...Bb7), the Smyslov (9...h6), the Breyer (9...Nb8), and the Chigorin (9...Na5).  All are roughly equally instructive at the club level.  I was glad to see four games with the Breyer, given that it gives Black very little active play but makes a White breakthrough difficult.<br /><br />This is a wonderful introduction to the Ruy, and I recommend it.White breakthrough difficult.

364855:US	53071109	RCZDJ7VS0I9A	0877229430	194402811	Atheism: A Philosophical Justification	Books	5	8	22	N	N	Thoughtful and comprehensive	This is a thoughtful study of arguments for and against the existence of a monotheist deity.  Of course, the title does bother me slightly, given that I regard Christianity, Judaism, and Islam as forms of atheism (I'm a polytheist and I see belief in one god as not really any different from belief in no god at all).<br /><br />The first question the author addresses is whom the burden of proof is on.  He's all in favor of discussing his views, so he does not press that argument.  But I think the burden of proof begins with those who claim that a monotheist deity exists, at least until they define it.  After that, the burden of proof may switch.  For us polytheists, I think there are definitions of the Goddesses and Gods as perfections of attributes, but I think the burden of proof is on us to supply those definitions before we ask others to argue that they aren't cognitive or real.<br /><br />Then we get into the question of meaningfulness of religious statements.  This is the falsifiabilty argument that has been advanced by Kai Nielsen and positivists of all sorts.  I think it is a strong argument.  My counterargument for polytheism is that if you show that an attribute really isn't coherent, then I'll admit that its Goddess or God does not exist.  Otherwise, I expect you to admit that its God or Goddess does exist.<br /><br />The issue of falsifiability is simple.  It's probably okay if others don't know what you believe.  But if what you believe isn't falsifiable, that means that you don't what you believe.  And that's more serious.<br /><br />Next is the ontological argument.  Martin spends only 17 pages on it, and he implies that it is 17 pages too many and that the whole argument is a joke.  Well, all I can say is that it is my favorite of the anti-atheistic arguments.  If you have read my previous paragraphs, you can see why.  I feel that a coherent attribute can in theory be perfect.  A well-defined being can be itself exactly, so it can in theory exhibit an attribute to perfection.  And I agree that non-existence would be an imperfection, so I like the ontological argument.<br /><br />After that, we get to the cosmological argument, namely that the monotheist god is The First Cause.  Martin shows that this argument has some flaws.  I think it has an extra one.  Namely, suppose we said that the whole universe rested on the back of a huge turtle.  We'd ask what that turtle stood on.  A much bigger turtle?  No good.  That would imply a chain of turtles that kept getting bigger.  What we need is a chain that gets smaller and smaller and finally vanishes.  And that means to me that if God is really the First Cause, She is infinitely weak and powerless.  No way would I worship something as unworthy as that!<br /><br />Martin is at his best when he discusses the teleological argument.  That's the argument that a complicated universe needs a designer, just as a watch needs a watchmaker.  But the author points out that this argument has some problems.  Better yet, given the complexity of the Universe, Martin says it makes far more sense to conclude that the Universe needed a bunch of designers, and that is more consistent with polytheism.<br /><br />The author does spend some time on arguments from religious experience, miracles, and various other evidence.  But I am not too interested in these.  I consider them equivalent to claiming that one's listeners believe in them.  If anyone disagrees with such a claim, they are right by definition.  And Martin also discusses \\"Pascal's wager,\\" in which it seems like belief in God is a good bet if one gets rewarded for it.  But this makes no sense unless there is a reason to believe that such belief is well-defined and that a positive reward is actually likely.  Otherwise, I think it is like asking someone how big a lie one must tell them before they will believe it.  If they won't accept a hopelessly counterfeit hundred dollar bill, why should they accept a hopelessly counterfeit billion dollar bill?<br /><br />I think the most devastating part of the book comes near the end, where the monotheist god is shown to be incoherently defined.  That is, it is inconsistent to say that this god is omnescient, omnipotent, and moral.  Matter of fact, I think it is inconsistent to say that God is perfect, given that something which is perfect at one thing is necessarily imperfect at its opposite.  And that gets us into the argument from the existence of evil.  The existence of evil appears to cast doubt on the existence of an all-powerful and good God.  This is discussed at length, along with the question of free will.  In any case, I think that Martin successfully argues for the non-existence of the monotheist god.  Well, monotheists, my Goddesses and Gods are doing just fine.  Sorry to hear about yours.t of the book comes near the end, where the monotheist god is shown to be incoherently defined.

Books	5	4	5	N	N	Written in 1978 but still worth reading	The international community has been exposed to an onslaught of anti-Zionist propaganda from the United Nations for some time.  In 1974, the UN invited an infamous terrorist, Arafat, to sermonize it.  In 1975, the UN passed a resolution (revoked in 1992) that Zionism is a form or racism!<br /><br />Now I can understand the fact that sometimes nations get into fights.  And we can't ensure that every nation that gets into a fight will always say nice things about its enemies.  But in this case, the United Nations, which had a fair amount of its reputation riding on being at least a little reasonable, voted for this nonsense.  And just as it damaged the Roman Senate when Caligula appointed a horse to it, this damaged the United Nations.<br /><br />Given the damage the UN's anti-Zionism has done to the international community, I think Herzog's book is very valuable.  It shows just how arbitrary and perverse some of the anti-Israeli accusations have been.<br /><br />Herzog noted in his speech against the Zionism - Racism resolution that he was speaking exactly 37 years to the day after Kristallnacht, and that the German leader of 1938 would have felt at home in that forum.  That speech is the first chapter of the book, and it is well worth reading.  Herzog finished by pointing out that \\"this resolution based on hatred, falsehood, and arrogance is devoid of any moral or legal value.\\"  And he then tore up the draft text of the resolution.<br /><br />Herzog makes some more points in the book.  He explains that Israel is in Jerusalem by right, and that Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, needs to be united in peace, with freedom for all religions, not divided, at war, and with restrictions against religions.  He explains that the main essential for peace is for the Arab world to accept Israel's existence.  And that Israel owes no explanation for the exercise of its rights.<br /><br />Herzog also states that Israel will not negotiate with terrorists who seek its destruction.  Well, he turned out to be wrong.  Israel tried it.  But in Herzog's defence, it turned out to be a bad idea.<br /><br />The author also brings up the issue of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.  Here, he agrees with the statement that these settlements are an issue because the existence of Israel is an issue.  As Herzog reminds us, the settlements are not illegal, they are not an obstacle to peace, and they are not established at the expense of expropriated Arab lands.  There is a 1977 UN resolution about these settlements that disagrees, of course.  And Herzog points out that according to it, he is forbidden to settle in the village of Masuoth Yitzchak, named for his own father.  Why?  For one reason.  Because he is Jewish.  That means that the UN has simply extended the Nuremberg Laws from National Socialist Germany.  The author has exposed the racism of demanding that Jews be banned from and expelled from various regions.  And he's also established that UN resolutions about Israel are often lies.<br /><br />Herzog makes another good point when he mentions that the UN did not \\"create\\" Israel.  And that even in 1948, the UN did little to help defend Israel from the attack by five Arab nations.<br /><br />The entire book is very well-written.  It is not out of date:  truths remain valid.

Dalrymple travelled from Greece through Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Israel to Egypt in 1994 AD.<br /><br />The author tells all sorts of interesting stories.  He explains that the Marcionites of the sixth century did not like the Old Testament heroes.  So they made villains of those heroes, including the, um, devilish God of the Old Testament.  And they made heroes of Cain, of the, um, goodly people of Sodom, and of the Serpent.  As I said, it sounds fascinating.  And maybe it's true and well known.  Maybe not.<br /><br />By the time we get to Lebanon, we can see that the author is going to be taking sides on a few political issues.  So much so that I began to doubt some of his stories.  He started by explaining that most folks blame the Maronites for the Lebanese Civil War.  It was their \\"intransigence, their unapologetic Christian supremacism, their contempt for their Muslim neighbors, and their point-blank refusal to share Lebanon ...\\"<br /><br />All this could be true.  But isn't it interesting that Lebanon seemed to be getting by before Arafat and his thugs showed up?  Anyway, it's Arafat's main enemies, such as Bashir Gemayel, that Dalrymple unleashes on.<br /><br />Speaking of Arafat's enemies, Dalrymple tells plenty of anti-Israeli stories as well.  He sure doesn't like the fact that there are Israeli settlements in the West Bank.  I wonder if it ever occurred to him that both Arabs and Jews have a right to live there.  And that neither has a right to ethnically cleanse the area.  And that if there were a peace treaty that let both Arabs and Jews remain there, but insisted that neither side had a right to ban or expel the other, the Jews wouldn't be the side that refused.  I wonder if he would want reactionary and irredentist terrorists to be rewarded so that he and his neighbors would be kicked out of his town.<br /><br />The author deplores the fact that Christians are leaving the Middle East in droves.  But he shows deference to the Muslims who are chasing them out.  I think he ought to have shown a little sympathy for those who support the human rights of life, liberty, and property.  Instead, I think he simply made fun of them.his neighbors would be kicked out of his town. <br /> <br />The author deplores the fact that Christians are leaving the Middle East in droves.

The author did realize that there are some Muslim fanatics who are indeed anti-American.  And in 1985, she predicted further attacks on the United States from them.  That was an accurate prediction.<br /><br />But there is plenty of bad news.  She simply refuses to see many of the problems with some of the fanaticism she reports on.  She calls the Iranian revolution \\"genuine.\\"  Okay, the Communist revolution in Russia was genuine as well.  The question she overlooks is whether it is going to accomplish anything positive.<br /><br />And she has nothing good to say about Israel, even though she devotes a chapter to it, which she titles \\"The Hydra: Israel.\\"  I wonder what she has against Israel.  Isn't it, um, \\"genuine\\" too?<br /><br />By the way, I also found it weird that she called militant Islam a \\"crusade.\\"  I think that is a singularly poor choice of words here.  She might want to look up who the Crusaders were and whom they fought.<br /><br />To Wright, there are simply plenty of brave soldiers.  And they are willing to risk their lives for their causes.  She lets herself quote an unnamed Israeli analyst who asks \\"how different is the committed Shia from a Marine who runs up the hill in the face of gunfire to single-handedly take out a machine-gun nest, or an IRA prisoner who starves himself to death in protest?\\"<br /><br />Well, that is a good question.  And I think Wright should have answered it.  You see, plenty of policemen are brave.  So are plenty of thugs.  But one side is doing something worthwhile, and the other is doing something counterproductive.  That is the difference.<br /><br />In the case of Israel, the issue is simple.  There are some brave Jews who are trying to defend themselves and their rights as human beings.  And there are some brave thugs who are willing to risk their lives to obliterate the rights of Jews to life, liberty, and property.  That's something the \\"Israeli analyst\\" might have known as well.  If everyone acted the way the Israelis do, the world would be at peace.

It begins with Abraham and goes right into the 20th century.<br /><br />Right away there is a problem.  Outside of the Old Testament, there's not much evidence about the existence of Hebrews or Jews until we get to something like the thirteenth century BC.  Potok solves this by telling the Biblical story and also assuming that some of it is true.  He suggests that Hebrews probably came from Sumer and probably moved to Canaan.<br /><br />Potok surmises that Moses probably was the adopted son of an Egyptian princess.  I think this may be the author's weakest guess of all, by the way. In particular, I see no reason to guess that Moses was adopted.  If he existed and lived in Egypt, I'd guess that he was more likely a genuine prince than an adopted one.  As for the business of Moses having been pulled out of the Nile as a baby, I would have hoped for a mention that this might well have been a standard Egyptian ritual.  The author also says that three thousand or more Hebrew slaves may have escaped from Egypt in the Exodus.  Again, I think this is a very wild guess.  Given the lack of any evidence for the Exodus other than the existence of the story (and of Passover) in the first place, I think three thousand could well be a huge overestimate.<br /><br />Still, once we get into (and past) the Book of Judges, we're in genuine history where we're dealing with a real people in a real land.  And now Potok has something besides the Bible to go on.  He points out that even according to the Old Testament, Elhanen, not David, killed Goliath.  That surprised me, so I had to look it up.  In the Bible, David challenges Goliath, but winds up fighting an unnamed Philistine.  And later Elhanen kills Goliath.<br /><br />After that, there are long chapters on the interactions with the Greeks and Romans.  And with the Muslims and Christians.  And even with more modern and more secular people.  At the end, there are about 15 pages dealing with the twentieth century.<br /><br />Over four thousand years ago, a Sumerian wrote about the previous few hundred years of Sumerian kings.  And what he wrote included two short but powerful sentences that Potok quotes several times in this book.  \\"Who was King?  Who was not King?\\"  He was referring to a period of anarchy in which everyone did as they pleased.  But Potok notes that we've had a number of periods since then that were no better.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and I recommend it.ury.

Those who were sent to Greece were primarily Turkish-speakers, while those who were sent to Turkey generally spoke Greek.  Similarly, the Jews in Arab lands tended to speak Arabic.  We see a similar contrast in Israel as well.  Lewis explains that the dividing line is not really between Jews from Europe and those from Africa or Asia but between Jews from Christian cultures and Jews from Islamic cultures.<br /><br />The author claims that there is relatively little racism in Arab society.  There's plenty of bias, but Lewis says it is mostly religious.  On the other hand, his chapter on aliens and infidels shows what religious bias means.  It means the dhimma, and relegating religious minorities to \\"second-class citizenship.\\"  For many centuries, that made Islam relatively tolerant, as Christian lands relegated religious minorities to \\"no citizenship at all.\\"  But present Western liberal ideas are not consistent with limited rights any more, and thus the dhimma is now regarded by many Westerners as a form of religious intolerance.  The author explains that at the same time, many Muslims are regarding even the limited rights of the dhimma as too much and too dangerous.<br /><br />There are interesting discussions of country, nation, and state.  Again, the attitudes about such concepts are different in the Middle East from what they are in, say, Europe.  One excellent example that Lewis gives is the following.  Consider the names we Americans (as well, as those in European nations) give for the countries of Europe and their languages.  Germany-German.  Norway-Norwegian.  Finland-Finnish.  Hungary-Hungarian.  France-French.  Malta-Maltese.  Greece-Greek.  Albania-Albanian.  Spain-Spanish.  Sweden-Swedish.  And so on.  In many cases, the names are quite different from the names the natives of those countries call themselves.  But we have that correspondence in a huge number of cases between country and language.<br /><br />That's not so true in the Middle East.  One of the few exceptions is Arabia-Arabic.  But Arabia is not really a country.  Saudi Arabia is.  Yemen is.  Qatar is.  Oman is.  Arabia is a peninsula.  And there is the almost-exception of Persia-Persian.  But Persia is not a country.  Iran is.  And I'm not sure how much we use the word \\"Persian\\" to describe the language any more (and we certainly don't use the word \\"Iranian\\" to describe the language).  That leaves Turkey and Turkish, but the name Turkey is of European origin and is of a country that is partially in Europe.  The correspondence between country and language is far less in the Middle East than in Europe.<br /><br />The book includes a discussion of symbols, and the author points out that the Muslim crescent and the Jewish six-pointed star do not have anything like the significance in these religions that the cross does in Christianity.  And what about the Veil?  For pious women, the garments are a symbol of submission, for emancipated women, they are a symbol of repression, and for Western Muslim women, they are often proud symbols of identity.<br /><br />This is an excellent and very informative book and I highly recommend it.ian.

It describes many aspects of Paganism: options, beliefs, practices, lifestyles, and so forth.  And it has a specific point of view.  In this age of monotheistic religious fundamentalism, \\"Drawing Down the Moon espouses radical polytheism.\\"  It's definitely anti-authoritarian.<br /><br />And I certainly like that attitude.  I find monotheism theologically unsound, morally bankrupt, and often tyrannical.  Polytheism is more natural; it is better suited to us varied and fickle humans, it gives us more options, more freedom, more flexibility, and even more privacy.  If we want to have people telling us exactly what our religious practices must be, we might as well choose monotheism in the first place.<br /><br />There is a good discussion of Pagan history, including the issue of revisionism.  That is something I am sensitive to.  I've seen too much monotheistic revisionist history.  I don't need more of the same thing in Pagan history.<br /><br />On the topic of ecology, Adler quotes Lynn White's claim that \\"Christianity made it possible to exploit nature in a mood of indifference to the feeling of natural objects.\\"  And I think this is an exaggeration.  But I do think it is accurate to say that monotheism did dump much of the reverence for natural objects or their Goddesses and Gods.  And I also think it's true that the majority of Pagans show more respect for nature and ecology than the majority of monotheists.<br /><br />One topic that was shortchanged in the original edition was Norse Paganism, which has restored the worship of local Norse Goddesses and Gods.  I'm glad there's a section on this in the revised edition.  After all, I remember reading Njal's Saga as a teenager and being outraged by the fact that Hjalti Skeggjason had taunted the Icelandic Pagans by saying that either Freyja or Odin had to be a dog.  To top it off, I was born on a Wednesday!<br /><br />Adler shows that one problem with modern Norse Paganism is that many of the Odinists and Asatruarfolk are not all that liberal, and some are racist, chauvinist, and ultra-nationalist. And while swastikas are ancient Norse symbols, their role in World War Two made them so offensive that their use discredits Asatru to a huge number of people.<br /><br />The revised edition includes some results of an interesting questionnaire that Adler distributed in 1985.  It includes statistics on how open Pagans are about their spiritual practices.  How many feel afraid to come out of the broom closet?  And anti-Paganism has given some people a genuine cause for concern.  Here, Adler mentions the anti-Pagan propaganda film \\"The Occult.\\"<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it.e Odinists and Asatruarfolk are not all that liberal, and some are racist, chauvinist, and ultra-nationalist.

Some people think the talks failed because the Arabs refused to offer peace.  Some think they failed because the Israelis failed to make any serious concessions to achieve peace.  I happen to think that they failed for two reasons: the Israelis were never offered the only thing they wanted, namely peace, and the Arabs were offered land and a state, neither of which they actually wanted.<br /><br />Rubin disagrees with all these ideas.  He states that the immediate problem was that a settlement was indeed close.  And it was the threat of peace that scared the Arab side.  Peace might destabilize Arab regimes.  And given that Arab leaders had spent years crafting an extremist public opinion, they now chose to let that public opinion scuttle negotiations.  I think this is an interesting possibility.<br /><br />The author also reminds us that \\"terrorism is not a weapon of the poor or oppressed but a carefully thought out revolutionary tactic.\\"<br /><br />Rubin quotes a couple of Arabs who say that from a practical standpoint, Arabs would be better off making peace.  After all, it is unlikely that the more extreme Arabs will achieve all their demands, some of which are quite unreasonable.  And they are ignoring the balance of forces.  But Rubin explains that in this situation, Arabs are indeed ignoring the balace of forces.<br /><br />I would go further than that.  First, I would note that part of the Arab demands happen to be to deprive Jews and others of rights to life, liberty, and property.  Such demands are arbitrary.  Next, I would note that Arab demands happen to include the theft of Levantine land from the land-poor.  Even if these demands are met now, in the long run, non-Arabs will almost surely buy even more Levantine land than they now have, and keep it.  And finally, I do agree with the implication that anti-peace Arabs are regarding war as something desirable in and of itself, even if the balance of forces is very poor.<br /><br />The author quotes a poll taken by al-Jazeera in 2001 which asked which was worse, Zionism or Nazism.  I found this interesting.  You see, I regard Zionism, which is simply Jewish nationalism, as the application of human rights for everyone, including Jews.  Given that I support human rights, I support Zionism.  And I regard Nazism as opposition to human rights.  But how would the majority of Arabs see it?  Many of them supported the Nazis.  And many are against human rights for themselves, against human rights for Women, against human rights for minorities, and against Jewish rights in particular.  Obviously, quite a few Arabs oppose human rights, and might well like Nazism and dislike Zionism.<br /><br />Anyway, the poll came out with 84.6% preferring Nazism (saying Zionism was worse than Nazism), 2.7% preferring Zionism, and 11.1% regarding them equally \\"bad.\\"  I guess the rest had no opinion.<br /><br />Rubin concludes that the tendency towards anti-American politics in Arab lands is hurting Arab people in general.  So are anti-Western, anti-American, and anti-Israeli lies.  And those who purport to champion the \\"Arab Cause\\" are in fact adding to Arab misery.cation that anti-peace Arabs are regarding war as something desirable in and of itself, even if the balance of forces is very poor.<br /><br />The author quotes a poll taken by al-Jazeera in 2001 which asked which was worse, Zionism or Nazism.

This book does an excellent job of showing the propaganda, incitement, and lies that Arab antizionists have subjected their populations to in their war against Jewish rights.<br /><br />Ben Gad supplies plenty of cartoons and photos to back up the points that he makes.  He documents the PLO crimes in Lebanon.  And he shows that giving the PLO a state would merely endanger Israel while not helping the cause of peace at all.  The author also explains how the United Nations has supported terror when that terror has been against the Jewish state.<br /><br />This work is not meant to be a history book, but it does supply a reasonable historical overview of the conflict (excluding the part since the book was written, in 1991).  And this includes the fate of the more than 850,000 Jews who lived in Arab nations in 1948.  By 1976, less than 25,000 of those Jews remained.  Luckily, many of them found a new home in Israel.<br /><br />I think two points that this book makes ought not be forgotten.  It explains that the PLO is not a peace partner.  Since 1991, the world has been urged to believe otherwise.  And in spite of the fact that the nature of the PLO was obvious, much of the world pretended otherwise.  In short, most of the world claimed that the Emperor was wearing not merely underwear, but a tuxedo, when in fact it was clear to anyone who looked that he wasn't wearing anything.<br /><br />Why did this happen?  Well, I think it is simple.  Some people in a position to write books or report on the area were pressured or bribed into lying.  Others did so out of a sincere desire to be malicious.<br /><br />But the truth is out now.  More than thirteen years have passed since this book was written.  We've seen that the PLO was never a peace partner.  Arabs may indeed want peace, but they'll need to find representatives who want it as well.<br /><br />The second point is that Arab antisemitism, as we see in cartoons, books, and other media, is not compatible with peace.  In the years since 1991, we've seen an insistence by the Arab side to keep up this steady stream of incitement.  Of course, that ought to have scuttled any peace talks.  But it did not.<br /><br />I think it is worth reading this book even today, just to realize how little things have changed.  I think it will make us see just how easy it is to pressure Israel into accepting phony promises of peace.  And how dangerous it is to everyone, especially the Arabs, for the international community to keep making such concessions to Arab terror.e with peace.

While there is much more in the book than this portion, I think Huband's treatment of this conflict is so far off that it compromises the entire work.  And Huband begins the section by quoting an Arab who says that although Israelis say they want peace, they do not really want it.<br /><br />Well, what are we to make of this?  After all, we know that the Israelis, good or bad, do want peace and do need peace.  They spent the past several decades building up a nation.  And they want to keep it.  That is one reason they need peace.  And that is also a reason why it is easy to tempt them with bogus offers of peace, just like tempting a fish with bait on a hook.  But just as fish need food, Israelis need peace.<br /><br />Huband didn't say that.<br /><br />But we know that Israelis really do want peace.  We know that if Israelis are innocent victims, they want peace.  We know that if Israelis are guilty thieves, they still want peace, just to keep their illicit gains.  What does it mean for Huband to imply that Israelis do not really want (or do not really appear to want) peace?<br /><br />Well such a claim is surely a falsehood.  But more than that, it is a taunt.  After all, suppose a bully decides to beat you up.  And suppose that bully claims you want to fight!  Obviously, you may well prefer to be left alone to being beaten up.  What the bully is saying is a taunt.  It's more than a mere falsehood.  It is a blatant way for bullies to tease their victims.<br /><br />That means that Huband's book is taunting Israelis.  That's not a very good thing for a journalist to do.  It goes beyond telling mere falsehoods.<br /><br />Huband also implies that Jews have taken Arab land, and admit to it.  And that they have taken an Arab country!  I wonder which one?  And I also wonder if buying land at high prices constitutes \\"taking\\" it.  After all, we humans are living on the same planet as the one that existed in 1805.  Not one human who was alive in 1805 is alive today.  Have we all stolen the planet from them?  Of course not.  We have bought it and inherited it.  There has been some theft, but that is no reason to invalidate the right of all humans to live on this planet today.<br /><br />Huband implies that the Arabs ought to have a greater right to steal Jewish land than the Jews do to own the land they bought at high prices.  That's bad journalism too.<br /><br />And there's more.  The author calls former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an \\"extremist.\\"  Now, I might understand making some snide remark about former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who after all was a former leader of the Stern Gang.  One might even do the same for former Prime Minister Menachim Begin, who was a former leader of the Irgun.  But Netanyahu?  Once again, this is poor journalism.  And by the way, you might want to see how often the author calls any Arabs \\"extremists.\\"<br /><br />It is true that antisemitic propaganda and incitement in the Arab world has reminded many Israelis of similar propaganda and incitement in Germany in the 1930s.  And that has resulted in some analogies being made between Arab antisemitism today and German antisemitism before and during World War Two.  Huband makes fun of such analogies.  I think he should have taken them seriously.  More bad journalism.<br /><br />The author does take Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi seriously, though.  Huband quotes him to explain that the Arabs are \\"innocent bystanders,\\" and that the Jews are visiting revenge on the Arabs for European antisemitism!  This is total nonsense, of course.  More bad journalism.<br /><br />Now, does a \\"one-state\\" solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict make sense?  Maybe so.  Israel exists in order to protect Jewish rights and to provide a refuge for Jews.  It exists to provide a state where Jews will speak Hebrew natively, attend Hebrew schools universities, have Hebrew traditions, and so forth.It can do all that in a state which has a large non-Jewish population.  And Israel, even with ten thousand square miles, would be rather small for a state which houses over five million Jews.  If Jewish rights to life, liberty, property, and immigration are protected, a one-state solution may be best.  Besides, while many people say that another Arab state is needed as well, I see no real need for one except as a mechanism to attack or destroy Israel.<br /><br />The author agrees that a one-state solution is best.  And I think he even acknowledges that Israel is part of the Middle East.  But it seems to me that his reason for wanting a one-state solution is to demolish Jewish rights rather than support them.  And getting rid of human rights would be bad for everyone in the region.<br /><br />This book is a good one to avoid.srael, even with ten thousand square miles, would be rather small for a state which houses over five million Jews.

For example, the Netherlands may have a Muslim majority by the year 2040 (then again, it may not).  Should that worry those of us who are Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Pagans?  As well as those of us who are not?<br /><br />Well, if we're going to live together in peace, I think it all sounds really good.  The newcomers probably will contribute greatly to Holland.  And those Dutch who convert will make their society more diverse.  But what if the Muslims are led mostly by extremists?  What if we get a society led by something more like the Mafia, or the Ku Klux Klan, or the Stalinists, or the National Socialists, or the Maoists, or simply the Taliban?  Then I think we have less reason to be optimistic.  And the author of this book agrees.<br /><br />In the first part of this book, Spencer discusses Jihad now.  He explains that dhimmitude is a direct challenge to the proposition that all people are created equal with unalienable rights.  He points out that the Wahhabis, the majority in Saudi Arabia, are one of the most extreme of the Islamic sects, and that they routinely identify their enemies as \\"Jews and Christians.\\"  He gives examples of hatred taught to schoolchildren from Wahhabi texts, not just in Saudi Arabia, but right here in Muslim schools in the United States.  Typical of the preaching is the claim that Wahhabi dead go to Paradise while Jewish dead go to Hell.  Given the company each would have there, I suspect that if this is true, the Jews are getting the better deal.<br /><br />I think a very revealing comment is a quote from two eleven-year old Arab girls.  They were asked which they would prefer, to have peace and full rights for all Arab people or for the two of them to die as martyrs.  Interestingly, they immediately chose martyrdom: peace and justice were not important to them, even on their terms.<br /><br />The second part of the book deals with the history of Muslim Jihad.  Here, Spencer exposes the myth that non-Muslims were treated well in Islamic lands.  Some non-Muslims did indeed do well, but none had the rights of Muslims.  And he also points out a very interesting statistic.  Fifty years ago, Christians were 15% of the total population of the Middle East.  They are now 2% of that population.  And it is pressure from radical Islam that has caused this.<br /><br />As Spencer says, \\"the problem of radical Islam is not a liberal or conservative issue.  It is a human rights issue.\\"  But many people on the political Left seem to apologize for radical Islam.  Why?  The author gives the answer: it is because radical Islam is anti-American.<br /><br />I think it is a big mistake for anyone who has any sympathy for liberalism to support reactionary terrorism, but it seems that many people strongly disagree with me about this.  As for the author, he regards those who ally themselves with America's enemies as having chosen sides in a war we're in.  I agree with him about this.<br /><br />Well, what is to be done about the threat of radical Islam?  Spencer comes up with three main suggestions: monitor mosques, control immigration, and encourage moderate Islam at home and abroad.<br /><br />As a liberal, I'm nervous about monitoring mosques.  But I do think that we need to have some way to give law-abiding and loyal Muslims a way to demonstrate that they are not the problem.  Otherwise, I fear that all Muslims will be treated with suspicion here.<br /><br />The author thinks that Muslim organizations in this country need to renounce a theology of jihad and dhimmitude.  Once again, I think we need to find out which organizations are openly and explicitly willing to do this.  And finally, Spencer warns us that we do not encourage moderate Islam by being \\"politically correct\\" and pretending that extremists are in fact moderate.  The author concludes that those of us who love freedom need to oppose jihad.<br /><br />I highly recommendthis book to everyone.	2005-01-26

One is Richard Reti's \\"Masters of the Chessboard.\\"  Another is the recent Mammoth book of the world's greatest chess games, which John Nunn co-authored.  And there are others as well, including this one, originally written by World Champion Max Euwe and updated by John Nunn.<br /><br />I think this book may be the most instructive of them.  It has 61 games, 59 of which are annotated.  But more than that, it has a 17-page description of the teachings of Wilhelm Steinitz (the first World Champion of chess).  When I read the original version of this book, I had never seen a book by Steinitz, and I was not aware of some of the fundamentals of positional play.  This book changed all that.  It describes Steinitz's main elements of positional play: development, mobility, the center, king safety, weak squares, pawn structure, Q-side majority (with both Kings castled K-side), open files, two bishops, material advantage, and the need to convert temporary advantages to permanent ones at once (or lose them).  And it gives some of Steinitz's games which illustrate these elements.<br /><br />My only complaint with the book is that it did not spend a few more pages describing a little of the thinking of other chess strategists, such as Nimzovich, Reti, Larsen, or Benko.  We see one Nimzovich game in which blockade plays a role, but we don't see much of his other ideas, such as overprotection.  We see very little on the theory of playing a flank game in which one gives up the center and then plays against it.  And I think the Benko gambit is just one example of another style of play that could have been included.<br /><br />I recommend this book, especially to those who want to learn more about positional play.	2005-01-25

This book is of the latter nature.  Modern Israel came into being in 1948 for a specific immediate reason, namely to get rid of the British White Paper of 1939 that basically prohibited Jewish immigration to the Levant.  By being against human rights for Jews, this book winds up being against human rights for everyone.<br /><br />What is new in this 2003 version?  Well, we start by learning that Jews are stifling free speech!  That it takes courage to speak out against Israel, and against the post-9/11 \\"incursions into the occupied territories.\\"  Um, these are actually disputed territories, but whether they are or not, acts of war launched from them are likely to meet with some sort of response, sooner or later.  And I think we can all tell where the author stands on terror when he treats responses to terrorist attacks as crimes.  Actually, I deplore the fact that there is so little criticism of people such as the author who refuse to condemn such terror.  Given how mild this criticism is, I find it outrageous to refer to those who apologize for terror as courageous.<br /><br />The book also tells us that it is open season on Arabs.  Here, Findley may have a point sometimes.  There is plenty of suspicion of Arabs in general since 9/11.  But I do not see how this will get better if more of us adopt a policy of applauding terror!<br /><br />Findley makes it appear that Israel is awfully important.  And it raises the question of why some folks insist on defending it (or, as in my case, insist on opposing those who support attacks on it).  If Israel is indeed evil, why bother?  Well, Findley has it all worked out: Jews are doing this counterproductive thing of defending Israel out of loyalty, those who are not defending Israel are simply being moral, and even some Jews are too moral to defend Israel.<br /><br />Well, I have a countertheory.  I think some reactionary Arabs simply couldn't accept the liberation of dhimmis such as the Jews, and are demanding to get rid of Jewish rights once and for all.  And they have used their money and threats to propagandize and pressure plenty of people into adopting some very racist and counterproductive policies.  And I think that while some Jews indeed do support Israel out of loyalty, others simply feel pressured not to.  In addition, I think that some \\"Jewish\\" antizionists who are not particularly loyal to Zionism don't seem to consider themselves Jewish either. As I see it, Israel is neither particularly important nor much of an issue.  The issue is Arab terrorism in opposition to human rights.<br /><br />Findley complains that some Jews cried out \\"No more Arafat!\\"  Well, I applaud them.  I think these are people who simply prefer that human rights be supported and that thugs be opposed, even if it might mean permitting Israel to survive.<br /><br />AIPAC gets heavily criticized in this book.  But, as AIPAC leader Hyman Bookbinder once said, the Jewish lobby is not as strong as its critics pretend it is, but it is stronger than they wish it were.<br /><br />There is a section about the US ship, the Liberty, which we now know was attacked by accident by Israel during the Six-day war.  But it seems that the author has not noticed that this truth is now known.  Maybe, hopefully, the author wrote this section before it became so well known that the whole affair was an accident.<br /><br />And there is a chapter about subverting academic freedom.  Is this a joke?  Has anyone gone into the bookstore of any elite university for the past two decades and looked at the Middle East section?  I sure have.  And that section is generally flooded with academically dishonest books of an anti-Zionist nature.  Findley has the problem backwards.  What we need are standards of academic honesty.  We've already got academic freedom, and we need to keep that too!<br /><br />I did wonder how Findley would excuse the fact that a noted terrorist leader, Sami al-Arian was kept on the payroll of a Florida university for so long.  Well, guess what?  Findley didn't need an excuse.  Instead, he called al-Arian a \\"veteran champion of Arab and Muslim rights.\\"  And he said that al-Arian was \\"the first tenured professor in American history to be fired for exercising his right to free speech.\\"<br /><br />Hopefully, those words too were written before the full scope of the case against al-Arian became public knowledge.<br /><br />Golly, this book is awful.ld excuse the fact that a noted terrorist leader, Sami al-Arian was kept on the payroll of a Florida university for so long.

The analysis of the war against Iraq is not all that coherent.  As I see it, one ought to evaluate the following sets of scenarios, whether one could have achieved them or not, about the decision to invade Iraq.  Namely, what benefits and disadvantages would there be in all six situations: not trying to get UN approval, trying to get it and failing, and trying to get it and succeeding.  Yes, that is three cases, but for each case, we could actually invade or decide not to do so.<br /><br />Then the authors could have discussed the advantages of being able to avoid immediate commitment of our forces, and the flexibility that such a policy might provide.  And they could also have discussed the risks of not fighting, including the possibility of incurring some catastrophes by refusing to take action, or of making future battles more difficult and losing flexibility of action.<br /><br />I think the authors ought to have talked about the war against Iraq in something similar to such terms.  Still, I won't fault them all that much for this, given that other writers are just as bad (or worse) in this respect.<br /><br />In addition, there could have been a better discussion of the weapons of mass destruction.  The issue is not whether the case for going to war was reasonable.  It is whether the misimplications about this issue changed the minds of legislators and voters.  If that is the case, then there are some procedural mistakes in the system.  And if we don't fix this, we'll all be at a disadvantage in the future.  We'll either be too aggressive, and make decisions based on misinformation, or we'll completely lose faith in our information and make decisions on even more illogical grounds.<br /><br />Now for some of the good news.  Frum and Perle do make some very straightforward and valuable comments.  Here are eight of them:<br /><br />1)  Neither the Ku Klux Klan nor Jesse James were a \\"national resistance.\\"  Describing their political heirs as such is incorrect.<br /><br />2)  Toppling Saddam Hussein denied a huge victory to our enemies and may make future potential aggressors think twice about taking us on.<br /><br />3)  American Muslims ought to be expected, as citizens, to stop the flow of their funds to terror, end incitement in their schools and mosques, stop promoting antisemitism, and avoid denials and excuses for failing to do this.<br /><br />4)  Whenever militant Islam approaches power, it turns its wrath on women.<br /><br />5)  The Arab-Israeli conflict is not a cause but a manifestation of Islamic extremism.<br /><br />6)  Respect for America on the world stage rests not merely on our power and wealth but also on our moral authority.  If we go back on our principles, we give credence to charges that we're a \\"rogue nation, an imperial state, and a threat to world order.\\"<br /><br />7)  At the UN, \\"the heroes are in fact thieves, thugs, liars, and killers.  The UN regularly broadcasts a spectacle as dishonest and morally deadening as a Stalinist show trial.\\"<br /><br />8)  The defeat of Muslim extremism will come, maybe sooner than most of us expect.<br /><br />I recommend this book.  It has plenty for us all to ponder.political heirs as such is incorrect. <br /> <br />2)  Toppling Saddam Hussein denied a huge victory to our enemies and may make future potential aggressors think twice about taking us on. <br /> <br />3)  American Muslims ought to be expected, as citizens, to stop the flow of their funds to terror, end incitement in their schools and mosques, stop promoting antisemitism, and avoid denials and excuses for failing to do this. <br /> <br />4)  Whenever militant Islam approaches power, it turns its wrath on women. <br /> <br />5)  The Arab-Israeli conflict is not a cause but a manifestation of Islamic extremism. <br /> <br />6)  Respect for America on the world stage rests not merely on our power and wealth but also on our moral authority.

It isn't easy to put the book down.<br /><br />Ragen is terrific in describing the horror of Arab terror in Israel and relating it to the horror of Auschwitz.  Her mother-in-law survived three years in Auschwitz as a teenager.  And while she was writing this book, Ragen found out more about Arab terror than she wanted to when she was at the Park Hotel in Netanya in 2002 for Passover.  Twenty-nine people died when a terrorist bomber struck, and hundreds were wounded.<br /><br />Is this thriller a political work?  Well, it definitely takes a stand on a couple of issues.  And I'll tell you which ones.  First, it is refreshingly in favor of human rights.  That is a pleasant change from a number of other works of fiction that I've read.  And the author is not afraid to look media complicity with terror right in the eye.  Finally, Ragen manages to portray violent criminals without glorifying them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  I think that anyone who likes human rights and dislikes terror will enjoy this book very much.	2005-01-24
375751:US	53071109	RHZXQV0LWMKLU	0964479656	567134683	Learn to Play Go, Vol. 5: The Palace of Memory	Books	5	36	37	N	N	The Modern Go Instructor	This is an excellent book about Go.<br /><br />In the preface of this book, Janice Kim says that she considered calling the book \\"My System.\\"  Of course, the reference was to Aron Nimzovitch's chess book with that title.  That book stressed some elements of chess, such as the blockade and overprotection that had been underestimated or overlooked by many good players.  Anyway, as I'm sure we all realize, that title simply would not do.<br /><br />But it would have been the wrong title anyway.  The proper title, had Kim wanted to make an analogy with chess, would have been similar to that of World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz's book from the 1880s (The Modern Chess Instructor).  Needless to say, that sort of title would not have been appropriate here either, but it is the proper analogy.<br /><br />Steinitz came up with about a dozen fundamental principles of positional play.  And Kim has done roughly the same thing in this book.  Of course, Steinitz was devising these principles himself, while Kim is simply repeating what has been well-known for centuries.<br /><br />Or is she?  The simple principles that she drums into us, all of which ought to be well-known to all low-kyu players, are not the whole story.  The implications of these principles constitute the teaching she presents.  For example, we all should know that the threat of a five-stone capture of a single stone (a pon-nuki with a friendly stone added touching two of the capturing stones) is inefficient.  Kim shows an implication of this is that we ought not threaten to make such a capture, and an implication of not wanting to make such a threat is that we ought not form a \\"closed triangle\\" that will lead to us making such a threat.<br /><br />She's turned a set of go proverbs into a coherent procedure for evaluating moves in most fights.<br /><br />Kim starts by reminding us that in a race to acquire territory, the maxim is to get out in front of one's opponent and then cut him off!  And then there are her Fourteen Points (as I call them) of Shape in Fighting:<br /><br />1)  Attach, Hane<br />2)  The Tiger's Mouth<br />3)  The One-Point Jump<br />4)  Jump-Cut the Knight's Move<br />5)  Cut, Extend<br />6)  Prevent the Bamboo Joint<br />7)  The Empty Triangle<br />8)  Sacrifice Two<br />9)  Cap, Knight's Move<br />10)  The Center of Symmetry<br />11)  Peep, Connect<br />12)  Hit the Head of Two (or Three)<br />13)  The Squeeze<br />14)  The Star Capture<br /><br />Kim gives us more advice than this.  On openings, she reminds us that her principles are: first approach the corners (in one of five ways: the 4-4, 3-4, 3-3, 3-5, or 4-5 points), second enclose or approach \\"unbalanced\\" corners, then play in the side star regions, make secondary side extensions that aim at invasions, after the sides, enlarge and defend towards the center, the third line is the line of territory, the fourth line is the line of influence, find your \\"good side,\\" bases are crucial: don't make groups without a base, and stay away from strength.<br /><br />And there are endgame principles: locate the big endgame, calculate, look to the edges, take and keep sente, be sure to get the double-sente moves, endgame moves related to a group's base are urgent, watch your liberties, watch the safety of your stones, and finally, save the endgame for the endgame!<br /><br />On all her principles, Kim gives some great examples and exercises for the reader.<br /><br />This is a fine finish to a marvellous set of five introductory Go books.ghting:    1)  Attach, Hane  2)  The Tiger's Mouth  3)  The One-Point Jump  4)  Jump-Cut the Knight's Move  5)  Cut, Extend  6)  Prevent the Bamboo Joint  7)  The Empty Triangle  8)  Sacrifice Two  9)  Cap, Knight's Move  10)  The Center of Symmetry  11)  Peep, Connect  12)  Hit the Head of Two (or Three)  13)  The Squeeze  14)  The Star Capture    Kim gives us more advice than this.

And this is one of many that did not achieve its objectives.  The idea was to cross the Antarctic continent.  And I do recommend the book by Vivian Fuchs and Edmund Hillary on the first successful crossing of Antarctica, which was completed only in 1958.<br /><br />This book is about the 1914-1916 Shackleton expedition, which attempted to start by reaching Vahsel Bay in Antarctica using a strong 144-foot, 350 horsepower wooden ship named the Endurance.<br /><br />But the Endurance never quite reached Vahsel Bay.  Instead, it became stuck in the ice near the Antarctic coast and eventually had to be abandoned.  That left the crew having to find a way to reach land, survive on that land, and find a way to send for help so that it could be rescued.  Even for a crew that had been prepared for being in cold weather and difficult circumstances, this turned out to be tricky.  It makes one amazed at how able people are to survive in extreme environments.  And, of course, this book is a testament to the leadership of Ernest Shackleton.<br /><br />Not only is the book very well-written and suspenseful, it also includes some terrific photos about the expedition.  It's a great work of non-fiction, and I highly recommend it.	2005-01-23

Would this book discuss it?  Would it be reasonably accurate?  Well, it did discuss it, and it was not accurate.<br /><br />Oh, it mentioned the fact that there was a Mandate in the region.  But it explained that the land had been promised to two different peoples.  Um, I wonder which two?  Maybe the Byzantines and the Mongols?  No, it turned out to be the Jews, given that Jerusalem was, after all, their capital and even in 1914 had a big Jewish majority.  And the Arabs, who had a vast Empire.<br /><br />Now, in reality, whether this promise was made or not, the Arabs were land-rich with or without little Israel.  And the Jews were land-poor whether they were asked to fit millions of people into a few thousand square miles or permitted to live on even less land than that.<br /><br />But this book implied that the Arabs and Jews were fighting over the same land.  That we all had to forget the millions of square miles of Arab land.  That was already spoken for.  And that we had to worry only about Jewish land, all of which was disputed!  And that allowing the Jews to have any land was a crime against the Arab people (but not allowing the Jews to have any land was unfair to the Jews...  that was why the situation was so tough).<br /><br />However, all that is simply a falsehood.  It is unfair to you to let a criminal steal your property.  It is not unfair to the criminal to let you keep your property.  And in the case of Israel, the Jews bought land at high prices while their Arab opponents demanded the right to steal it back.  That is one thing this book ought to have made clear but did not.<br /><br />The book explains that at the end of World War Two, the Jews \\"created a homeland.\\"  What a choice of words!  That region was the Jewish homeland since before World War Two.  For years before.  Actually, millenia, if I am not mistaken.  Anyway, Fellure implies that this \\"homeland\\" was \\"created\\" by unfairly taking land from the People there, 750,000 of whom were made homeless.  Um, weren't there several hundred thousand Jews in Arab lands that were not busy trying to destroy their nations who were simply expelled from Arab lands?  I didn't seem to see much about that in this book!  In any case, it is more than a bit arbitrary to focus exclusively on the Arabs who left their homes, during a war that they started, and blame the Jews for their present plight over fifty years later.<br /><br />It gets worse.  After all, there has to be some mention of the Six-day war.  In this book, it seems that no one knows who started it.  Fellure mentions that some say one thing, some say another.  Yes, but there are excellent histories of this war.  The author owes it to us to tell the truth, not lies.  And he didn't do that.<br /><br />I guess the final straw was the stuff about UN resolution 242.  While it says that Israel has to withdraw from territories as part of a final peace, Israel certainly did that when it withdrew from all of Sinai.  The West Bank is disputed land.  So is Gaza.  But Fellure comes right out and says that the West Bank and Gaza are occupied territroy from which Israel must withdraw, according to this resolution.  It looks like a little detail.  But it is a repeat of a Big Lie, which is part of an excuse for ethnically cleansing Jews from their homes in the West Bank.  And it isn't funny.  It doesn't give me much confidence in the rest of the book, by the way!<br /><br />After reading this book, I thought for quite a while about it.  Why was the book so bad?  Why did it parrot some outrageous untruths about Israel?  Moreover, why is it that these lies tend to be defended with great passion while truth often tends to be defended weakly if at all?<br /><br />I think part of the answer is power.  That is, suppose you stand up in front of powerful people and proclaim that two plus two is four.  And that you will stake your life, your fortune, your honor, and your mathematics grade on it!  Well, a powerful person may have you killed for saying it.  But more likely, the powerful people will shrug and say, \\"So what?  Everyone knows that two plus two is four.\\"  You will have accomplished nothing.<br /><br />On the other hand, suppose you make the same statement, except instead of saying that two plus two is four, you say it is seventy.  Not everyone knows that!  If you get away with it, you may become famous and powerful!  No wonder such outrageous claims are defended so passionately!<br /><br />The same sort of power is available to those who commit crimes.  You accomplish nothing by withdrawing thousands of dollars from your own bank account, quite legally.  You accomplish a great deal by robbing a bank and stealing the money.  If you get away with it.<br /><br />What we all have to do is demand honesty in accounts of the Middle East.  The reason there is a conflict between the Arabs and the Jews is that some reactionary Arabs can't stand the fact that former dhimmis have been liberated.  Since telling the truth won't help matters, the Arab case has been based primarily on terror and lies.  And the more we all put up with getting our information from books that repeat such lies, the worse off all people will be.rful person may have you killed for saying it.

Of course.<br /><br />I think it was political when Arabs built their homes with doors so low that folks couldn't ride their horses through them.  And obviously, it was political in 1936 to 1939, when Jews built 57 \\"stockade and tower\\" settlements, many of them in a single day.  But most of the politics I saw in this book was pro-ethnic cleansing of Jews from the West Bank, from the contributors.<br /><br />This book does have some maps and photos.  You may want to look at them in the library.  But don't buy the book.<br /><br />The book says that Jews are putting up buildings in the West Bank.  It implies that such construction is hideous.  It calls all this \\"arrogance.\\"  And it says that even a Jewish withdrawal from the West Bank will not undo all the damage.  But I think anything it says about the West Bank can be equally well applied to the rest of the Earth, and I think the bogus argument for removing Jews from the West Bank is no different from the one to remove them (or any other people) from this planet.<br /><br />In fact, Israel is land-poor.  Its people ought to have a right to buy land and live on that land, just as people everywhere in the world ought to have such a right.  The West Bank is disputed land, not the personal property of some Goddess who has permitted only Her People, the West Bank Arabs, to live on it.  Jews need to have as much of a right to live in the West Bank and build on it as do Arabs.  The authors, by failing to agree, have shown their opposition to human rights, not just for Jews, but for everyone.	2005-01-23

And I think you need to have played some games against some double-digit kyu players and some single-digit kyu players.  That way, you will know how it feels to need to connect stones, or connect groups, or separate enemy stones or groups, or escape with stones.  You'll know how it feels to need to find a good move to make something out of a tough position.<br /><br />Still, the problems in this book are quite reasonable.  I had more trouble with the ones in Volume 4 of \\"Graded Go problems for Beginners.\\"  The problems are instructive and are well-explained.  And as I said, these problems are clearly goal-oriented.  There are sections on capturing cutting stones, amputating cutting stones, and various kinds of ko.  There are problems involving fights between eyeless groups, between eyeless and one-eyed groups, and between two one-eyed groups.  There are sections on linking groups and on cutting groups apart.  On making shape.  And so forth.  It's just the sort of book that will help you in all phases of tactics in real game situations.	2005-01-22

But I'm glad that this one, one of the first really good such books, is still available.<br /><br />As the authors point out, in duplicate bridge, one routinely risks one's contract to get an overtrick, because the margin by which one beats the other pairs in one's direction does not matter as long as one beats them.  Your +630 at 3 NT making 4 may be fine, beating the +620 scores for 4 of a major, while +600 (which you get by making a safety play) may well get you a zero.  On the other hand, in competitive auctions, while +200 beats all part scores, you only need to double if you feel that most pairs your way will indeed get a plus score.<br /><br />Those who play Acol will enjoy the recommendations made to modify it for duplicate bridge.  Of course, you may already play many of them.  These include a variety of competitive doubles.  There are some \\"old\\" conventions, such as Swiss, Lightner doubles, and Unusual notrumps.  These conventions were around for some time when the book was written (1968), but the way the authors use them is a little different from what you might expect.  And some \\"new\\" (1968) conventions are suggested, such as Aspro over opponent's 1 NT opening in second or fourth position (bid 2D with spades and a minor, bid 2C with hearts and any other suit).<br /><br />The book includes a discussion of relay bidding systems and gives an example of a \\"futuristic\\" system, namely the \\"Little Major.\\"  I think you may not want to take up this particular system, even if your tournament director allows it, but it makes for interesting reading.  And the book then has a discussion of leads and signals.<br /><br />Oh yes, there is a final chapter about the personal factor.  Reese and Dormer give a great example.  What blind lead do you make against 3 NT from:<br /><br />Spades K J 6 3  Hearts Q 7 5  Diamonds J 6 4 2  Clubs 10 9<br /><br />Anything could be right, so just lead something quickly and smoothly.  A player who hesitates over this lead \\"is not cogitating\\" but dithering.  \\"Meanwhile, an astute declarer will be thinking\\" that you do not have a five-card suit, that your four-card suits are unattractive, and that the suit you finally lead may well be short.<br /><br />And a final piece of good advice has to do with your opponents.

This book is for grade school students and junior high school students.  You high school and college kids are too old for books written for little kids!<br /><br />As for us old folks, we'll just have to hide this book somewhere or maybe pretend that our children or grandchildren are the ones who are reading it.<br /><br />Seriously, it really is a book for kids.  But it's fun for everyone.  It has the straightforward spookiness of a children's story.  But it also has the highly imaginative touch of Diane Duane as an author.<br /><br />You don't have to start with the first book in the series, but I think it's better if you do.  In the first book, Juanita wanders into trouble pretty easily, but in this book, she really dives into it.	2005-01-19

And that we ought to embrace multilateralism and international law.  Well, that sounds really good.  Just what could be wrong with that?<br /><br />The main problem is that even if we Americans have been unfair and unjust, there is little reason to believe that we'll be better off if we give more power to an international group.  Such a group could be united against us, and it could make things worse for everyone (and really bad for us Americans).  Probably, we'd be assured at the start of the group's good intentions.  But after we conceded enough power, we'd get double-crossed.<br /><br />Well, there isn't too much chance of that!  The United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and others have made their intentions pretty clear.  And so does the author.  We're talking about a wolf in wolf's clothing.<br /><br />I think one important issue the author deals with is the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As he says, \\"On no issue is the gulf between America and the rest of the world greater than on\\" this.<br /><br />Well, given that the issue is so important, what does Prestowitz say?<br /><br />Well, he refuses to blame the Arab side for the failure of the Camp David negotiations.  And he says that Sharon's walk on the Temple Mount was about as bad an idea as one could have.  Okay, I have a few questions:<br /><br />1)  If the Arab case has any merit, why is it promoted almost exclusively by terror and lies?  Does he think that such terror and lies ought to be opposed?<br /><br />2)  Why does the author think it proper to ethnically cleanse Jews (but not Arabs) from the West Bank?  Isn't that a little arbitrary?  And why does the author think this injustice is essential to bring peace closer?<br /><br />3)  Given that plenty of members of the Knesset had been visiting the Temple Mount, why does the author think that a pre-approved visit by Sharon was so obviously a bad idea?  Has it occurred to him that refusing to let Sharon do something so ordinary might have severe ramifications in itself?  And just why is it that the author feels that a Jew visiting the holiest Jewish site, in the capital of Israel ought to be a casus belli?  Does this mean that the author thinks that Jews ought to be special in not having any rights in their own capital or at their own holy sites?<br /><br />Oh yes, some folks have boasted that the author is a conservative.  But I'm judging his book on its merits, not on the author's purported politics.  In any case, I'm a liberal.<br /><br />Had the author been more honest with us, I think I'd have been more willing to look at his advice.  As it stands, I think the one star I'm giving this book is generous.s it occurred to him that refusing to let Sharon do something so ordinary might have severe ramifications in itself?

Namely, why tell the reader what the theme is?<br /><br />Why say it is \\"double attack,\\" or \\"discovered attack,\\" or \\"discovered check,\\" or \\"pin,\\" or \\"diversion,\\" or \\"decoy,\\" or \\"interference,\\" or \\"defence-elimination,\\" or \\"square vacation,\\" or \\"line-opening,\\" or \\"utilization of open files,\\" or \\"diagonal-opening,\\" or \\"utilization of open diagonals,\\" or \\"smothered mate,\\" or \\"blocking,\\" or \\"x-ray\\" or \\"overloading,\\" or \\"back rank weakness,\\" or \\"weakness of the second rank,\\" or \\"zwischenzug,\\" or \\"passed pawns,\\" or \\"simplifying combinations,\\" or \\"stalemating combinations,\\" or \\"geometrical motifs,\\" or \\"attack on the king side castled position,\\" or \\"attack on the king caught in the center,\\" or \\"destructive combinations?\\"<br /><br />These are great themes to test us on, but in a real game, we don't know that there is a theme, let alone which theme!<br /><br />How good should one be at chess to profit from this book?  I think you need to be at least a C-player (1400 USCF) to get the full benefit.  And I've seen Masters go through it too!  It's good practice for a big range of chess players.

It shows the elements of the incitement and manipulation that create this culture.  And it makes it clear that suicide bombings are not just a few acts of a small minority, but have become an inherent aspect of the overall community.  It makes one sad to see all the destruction, and it makes one worried about the future of the Arab community as a whole, which appears to be its own worst enemy right now.<br /><br />Still, I had to take away a star from my rating.  That is because the authors make a huge effort to be totally neutral in the Arab-Israeli conflict.  They do not entirely succeed in this, but that isn't my complaint.  My problem with this attitude is that neutrality between aggressors and victims is a stand in itself.  Neutrality favors aggression and insanity, both of which need to be condemned severely.  Arab aggression is not helping Arabs or Jews.  It isn't helping the region to become more peaceful.  Quite the contrary.  Aggression needs to be opposed.  And the authors ought to have done just that.	2005-01-17

Where does this order come from?  Is it entirely from natural selection?  The author says no.  He explains that much of the order we see in the world is spontaneous, such as in the symmetry of snowflakes, and that much of the order needed for the origination of life and in living organisms is of this spontaneous nature.<br /><br />Kauffman is making a non-trivial point here, as the extent to which spontaneous order is more important than selected order is not entirely obvious.  While a snowflake is indeed an example of a system that is highly ordered as it gets synthesized, that's not true of, say, a solar system, in which short-lived bodies quickly depart the scene in favor of long-lived ones.  It's clearly significant that disordered entities tend to be shorter-lived and unable to replicate.<br /><br />The author then addresses theories of the origin of life.  Could it have started with RNA?  After all, replicating RNA could then produce the needed proteins.  Kauffman says no.  The amino acid chains one would need would be too long to replicate accurately enough (the \\"error catastrophe\\").  I tend to agree.  Besides, RNA is awfully fragile (DNA is not fragile).  And once one hypothesizes that RNA has a template to keep it safe, one's theory is that templates came first.<br /><br />Of course, the \\"error catastrophe\\" is devastating if the minimum complexity of a living cell is rather large.  Kauffman argues that this minimum complexity is indeed large, and that it is no accident that there are hundreds of genes in pleuromona, perhaps the simplest free-living (non-virus) organism.<br /><br />Spontaneous order also refutes the argument of Hoyle and Wickramasinghe that life could not have arisen on Earth because the chance of creating the 2000 functioning enzymes would be too small: 1 in 10 to the 40,000.  Well, given that life does exist here, the Hoyle argument is almost certainly wrong anyway (with a chance that small, the odds would be overwhelmingly small for life to arise anywhere, ever, so the chance that the argument is wrong must be huge, since a correct argument might then give a much higher probability for life to appear).<br /><br />The author then asks how we get the large polymers we need.  After all, life is basically autocatalysis (that's what I was taught in the 1960s, and that's what Kauffman says as well).  How does this big autocatalytic set get into gear?  The author makes an analogy to putting connectors between random pairs of entities.  At first the length of a connected chain will be small.  But once the number of connections is about half the number of entities, the longest chain quickly becomes almost as large as the number of entities.  That raises the question of how all these entities can interact, but Kaufmann says that having reactions on a substrate, effectively reducing the region to two dimensions, helps.  So does having less water around.<br /><br />We then get to the question of homeostasis.  That requires plenty of order.  Is there a way to get that order \\"for free?\\"  The author says there is, and here is where he makes his most dramatic point.  He points out that a network with 100,000 entities (call them \\"light bulbs\\") with two states each, has 10 to the 30,000 possible states.  One might expect such a network to cycle through the square root of the number of states, or 10 to the 15,000.  But it actually tends to cycle through the square root of the number of binary variables, which is only the square root of 100,000 or about 317.  That is a huge amount of \\"order for free!\\"  And it argues strongly for life's origination to be unsurprising.  As Kauffman puts it, this changes life on Earth from being \\"We, the improbable,\\" to \\"We the expected.\\"<br /><br />There's plenty more in this fine book.  The author discusses order in ontogeny.  And he has a chapter on the relationship between the diversity of species in an ecosystem and the diversity of organic molecules added from outside.  And there's also plenty of material on \\"fitness landscapes.\\"<br /><br />One question that arises in this book is statistical: how long does a species tend to last?  That has implications for the question of how long humans will last.  It may not be that long.  But that doesn't bother me, as long as we're replaced with something better.

Well, you would ask people to tell you the rules.  And you would improve just by trial and error.  But you might also need something you could use for a textbook or reference that would guide you through the steps to become more than a beginner.  That's true in Go as well.<br /><br />One problem with Go is that it is often hard for a beginner to have any idea what the score is.  In bridge, you know the score.  In chess, you can see if you are ahead in material.  In Go, it is tougher to see how you are doing.  It makes it that much more confusing for an untrained beginner.<br /><br />And that is where we come to books on Go for the beginner.  There are a variety of introductory books, such as the ones by Cho Chikun, or Kaoru Iwamoto, or Richard Bozulich, or Peter Shotwell (not to mention older ones such as those by Otto Korscheldt, or Edward Lasker, or Kaku Takagawa, or Arthur Smith).  Some are by famous Go champions, some are not.  But one can read any of these books carefully, play a few games, and still be a very weak player.<br /><br />For a set of books that can take one from a complete beginner, teach one the rules, and get one to single-digit kyu strength (or close to it), I like Janice Kim's 5-volume set the best.  And this is the second volume in it (second edition, 1998).<br /><br />I think these books teach the fundamentals better than the other books I mentioned.  In this book, one learns about making bases, running with attacked stones (that moving horse!), invading and reducing territory, and a little about attacking and defending.  I liked the example of a ko fight where one side runs out of ko threats but still comes out ahead (although losing the ko) because the winning ko threat was to try to escape from a ladder (adding stones to the ladder was worth as much as the ko).  And I liked the emphasis on preventing the \\"tiger's mouth\\" formation as a fundamental concept of contact fighting.<br /><br />This book is really easy to read: one does not even need a Go board to understand it.  And I thought it was a good idea for Kim to refer to White (generally the stronger player) as \\"she,\\" and Black as \\"he.\\"<br /><br />The first book in this series is for total beginners, and it teaches the rules of the game.  That material can be absorbed very quickly.  After that, this book ought to be easily readable for anyone who is interested in the game.one does not even need a Go board to understand it.

It includes telling about the famous 1945 Honinbo championship, played in 1945 in Hiroshima between Utaro Hashimoto and Kaoru Iwamoto.  Between moves 106 and 107 of the second game, Hiroshima was hit by an atomic bomb!  All the windows were broken, and it was afternoon by the time everything was tidied up and the game could be completed.  Hashimoto won.<br /><br />There's also plenty of information on the history Go in Europe, going back as far as the seventeenth century.  And it mentions that Marco Polo, a 2-dan player in the thirteenth century, was the very first European Champion.  And there is a history of modern Go through the year 2000.<br /><br />There is a short but interesting chapter on Computer Go.  And we learn that one can play Go on the internet: just, um, Go to<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />We learn about Go equipment, boards, stones, and bowls.  And there is a chapter on Go in Art.  Those who are interested might also want to look at William Pinckard's book on Japanese Prints and the World of Go.<br /><br />James Davies has a chapter on the rules of Go.  There are some fine points one may want to look up.  And the rules are not the same everywhere: you may need to look at the differences between the Japanese, Chinese, and New Zealand rules!<br /><br />Next there is a list (with short biographies) of all the professional Go players of Japan, Mainland China, South Korea, and Taiwan as of 2000.  And there are lists of the champions of all major professional Go tournaments.<br /><br />The book also has a dictionary of Go terms.<br /><br />I recommend this book for those interested in this game.	2005-01-15

As the author says, these are \\"curiosities\\" not \\"trivia.\\"<br /><br />We find out why Jerusalem became a center for Judaism but not for Christendom or Islam.  We learn about the Crusades.  About the Temple Mount, the Tower of David, and the Siloam and Bethesda Pools.  And about holy places of the Jews, Christians and Moslems.<br /><br />There is a section on the British in Jerusalem, which starts with Lord Palmerston's 1839 directive to the British Consul to exert friendly protection to all Jerusalem Jews, whether they be British subjects or not.  It also tells of the increasing British antagonism to the Jews in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s.<br /><br />There is also a chapter about the divided Jerusalem of 1948 to 1967, and Jordanian rule in the Eastern portion, followed by the reuniting of the city in 1967.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good read about Israel's capital city.	2005-01-15

Prior to that, I was a fair bridge player.  Afterwards, I was much better at declarer play.  The book includes 139 hands which it presents to the reader in the form of a quiz, with detailed answers.  It covers counting, card-placing, good and bad breaks, camouflage, communications, squeezes, match-point play, and percentages.<br /><br />The 20-page chapter about percentages was particularly instructive.  A bridge player does not need to know much about them.  The key knowledge is the distributions between your opponents of 2 through 8 card suits.  That means memorizing 16 numbers.  That's it.  With that knowledge, you can choose easily between lines of play that rely on good breaks or rely on avoiding bad breaks.<br /><br />The other chapter that made a big impression on me was the 30-page one on squeezes.  I didn't know anything about squeezes when I first read it.  Everyone talked about them, but I'd never intentionally played one.  Still, I realized that I'd gone down in a couple of contracts that I could have made had I understood how to play them.  I gulped when I read that the author expected the reader to be well aware of how to perform simple single and double squeezes.<br /><br />Anyway, I tried reading the chapter.  And rereading it.  And that is how I learned how to perform squeezes (they don't come up all the time, so one can play bridge moderately well without doing them).<br /><br />If you are a beginner at bridge, this book will be too advanced for you.  But if you have played in a couple of tournaments, you'll be able to understand it and profit from it.	2005-01-14

Quite the contrary.  Perhaps if any group of people has made me embarrassed to be a human being, they have.  After all, we're talking about people such as Hilarion Capucci, who is both an archbishop and a terrorist thug, and who invokes Jesus as though Jesus were a thug as well.  We're talking about Naim Ateek.  About Michael Sabbah.  We're talking about Hanan Ashrawi.  These people have done plenty to oppose human rights.  They have, by the way, done little to support their own religion, being happy to avoid any thought that Jesus might have been Jewish.  In fact, many are simply Marcionites, who have basically thrown away their Old Testaments.  Now, I happen to prefer the Koran to the Old Testament, but I'm surprised that \\"Christians\\" would.  And I'm even more surprised that Christian religious leaders would be so happy to support terror (some of it against Christians) from those of a different religion.<br /><br />I have no sympathy for the way these leaders propagandize in favor of terror.  I have no sympathy for the way they oppose other minorities, especially the Jews.  I have no doubt that they oppose Pagans as well.<br /><br />Still, I know that people are not always as bad as their leaders.  And I hoped that would be the case with the author of this book.  So I skipped breakfast and tried reading it!<br /><br />Well, the book started with an intoduction (by James Baker) that made me queasy enough so that I was glad I hadn't had breakfast.  And it turned out that Chacour was basically similar to the Arab Christian leaders, neither peace-loving nor moderate.  To him, Jews are not victims to be helped or defended.  They are evil creatures to be forgiven and cured.<br /><br />I generally feel for those who have suffered through wars.  And I know plenty of people who spent World War Two in London, Berlin, Tokyo, Paris, and far worse places.  It was no fun for many Japanese and Germans as the war came to a close and they wound up without food (or worse, sent to Siberia by the Russians).  But I can empathize with their plights.  And to their credit, I've never had any of them try to deny the fact that their nations were aggressors.

But when I speak the truth, I don't boast of it.  I simply tell people that it is they, not I, who must judge the validity of what I say.  And that they need to verify what they hear, whether it is from me or from anyone else.<br /><br />These authors have more than a little nerve when they say they are speaking the truth.  Of course, most of what they say isn't true at all.<br /><br />Desmond Tutu leads off with a vicious introduction.  Tutu was all in favor of human rights in South Africa.  But he sure isn't in favor of human rights in the Levant.  And he's opposed to human rights for Levantine Jews.<br /><br />Michael Prior writes about the challenge of historical truth and morality.  Well, what he writes clearly shows that this challenge is far too much for him.  And the Reuthers are simply more of the same.<br /><br />Ilan Pappe is next, and he says that the Israelis are in \\"denial.\\"  Actually, I think Israelis typically have a very good knowledge of the history of their region, maybe better than almost any other group in the world.  But even if many Israelis had some misconceptions about their history, what relevance would that have?<br /><br />Then we get to Daniel McGowan, who writes about Deir Yassin.  I think this battle was indeed a key victory in the struggle for human rights, on a par with Gettysburg or Stalingrad.  It was ugly, as over a hundred people died.  But that was a small number when you compare it with Stalingrad.  Or Gettysburg.<br /><br />Ask yourselves if you wish the Germans had won at Stalingrad and just kept winning after that.  It would have made hash of Soviet Russia.  But at the cost of having all of Europe under a terrible and arbitrary tyranny.  Stalingrad wasn't pretty, but it was a battle which had a good result for our species as a whole.  And Deir Yassin wasn't pretty either.  But it was one of the first battles in which the Jews actually fought back in their war for survival.  And while the Jews may not have needed to win at Deir Yassin any more than the Russians needed to win at Stalingrad, eventually both sides needed to win somewhere or condemn quite a few people to misery.<br /><br />That's not the picture we get from McGowan, who treats Deir Yassin as a Jewish war crime!  As far as I am concerned, what he writes is simply pro-terrorist propaganda.  While I certainly do not insist that he applaud Deir Yassin, I think he ought to admit that many good people do applaud it and for good reason.  And I do insist that what he does say about Deir Yassin be honest.  After all, didn't the title of the book say something about truth?<br /><br />The rest of the book is no better.  There are some articles on Christians in the region which make everyone look bad.  There's an article by Paul Eisen, who wants to speak the truth to the Jews.  The truth would indeed be a good idea!  Too bad he doesn't do it.  Naseer Aruri then discusses the Arab \\"right of return.\\"  More arbitrariness, more disregard for human rights.  What's next?

While I certainly do not insist that he applaud Deir Yassin, I think he ought to admit that many good people do applaud it and for good reason.  And I do insist that what he does say about Deir Yassin be honest.  After all, didn't the title of the book say something about truth?      The rest of the book is no better.  There are some articles on Christians in the region which make everyone look bad.  There's an article by Paul Eisen, who wants to speak the truth to the Jews.  The truth would indeed be a good idea!   Too bad he doesn't do it.  Naseer Aruri then discusses the Arab \\"right of return.\\"  More arbitrariness, more disregard for human rights.  What's next?  Maybe an explanation of why the Arabs have a right to \\"return\\" to Spain and expel the Spanish?      Elizabeth Barlow says that we need the will to act.  I thought about what would happen if we took her advice, and the implicit advice of the other authors.  Perhaps if we all did that, we'd wind up getting rid of our whole species, once and for all.    What we need instead of books like this one is the placing of more value on truth, justice, and human rights.	2005-01-13

These articles (and a few more) have been collected into this book.<br /><br />The stories are a funny sidelight to what the book is all about, namely the bridge hands.  Still, just as one remembers the bridge characters in Simon's \\"Why You Lose at Bridge\\" or in Mollo's \\"Bridge in the Menagerie,\\" it is tough to forget some of the characters in this book, whether they be the wise Weston, Norton, and Easton or the, um, imps (Olite, Udent, and Ossible).  But there is a difference among the levels of play in these books.  In Simon's book, the play is atrocious.  In Mollo's, the play is a little better, and the hands are more amusing.  In Theimer's, the play is pretty good at worst, and impossibly good at best.<br /><br />Does it improve one's bridge to struggle with hands such as these?  I think it does.  None of us are going to see all the fine points and we'll rarely if ever get any of his hands perfect (and the author doesn't give anyone much credit for coming up with a second-best line).  But there are still valuable lessons in these amazing hands.  In any case, whether you want to improve your Bridge or just have fun reading about it, this is a great book.	2005-01-12

Of course you should.  But there are considerations that may restrict your choices.  Some openings concede your opponent a choice of moves that offer such a big advantage that studying them is a waste of time.  And others, such as the Marshall Gambit against the Ruy Lopez, are so good that most of your opponents will avoid them.<br /><br />This book has some suggestions that you may want to try, just to see if they suit you.  My point is simple.  If you do indeed like some lines in this book, you can be sure that they make sense, they score well at any level of chess, and you can get to play them.  In addition, the openings are solid enough so that studying them is worthwhile.  And the author checked his analyses using three strong software packages (\\"Fritz 8,\\" \\"Junior 8,\\" and \\"Hiarcs 8 and 9\\").<br /><br />With White, Kaufman suggests an Exchange Ruy.  No Flohr-Zaitsev-Karpov Variations.  No Breyers.  No Chigorins.  No Marshalls.  No Moellers.  No Archangelsks.  And no Open Variations!  Instead, those who want to avoid your Exchange Variation after 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 will have to try the Steinitz (3...Nf6 4 0-0 d6), the Bird (3...Nd4), the Cozio (3...g6), the Schliemann (3...f5 4 d3), the Classical Berlin (3...Bc5 4 0-0 Bc5 5 Ne5), or the Berlin proper (3...Nf6 4 0-0 Ne4 5 Re1 Nd6 6 Ne5 Be7 7 Bf1).  And those who want to avoid all this on move two will need to choose among the Russian (2...Nf6), the Philidor (2...d6), the Latvian (2...f5 3 Ne5), and the Elephant (2...d5 3 ed).  This book tells you how to do well against all these choices.  As for the Exchange Ruy itself, let's just say that I'd much rather have White than Black in it!<br /><br />With White against the Sicilian, the author advises 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 Bb5+.  And 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5.  Um, okay.  That avoids the dangerous Najdorf variation.  And the Kalashnikov.  And the Dragon.  While White has fine chances in these Open Sicilians, the games become very tactical.  But that does leave us without a very scary line against 1 e4 c5 Nf3 e6 (with Black aiming to play a Scheveningen or a Taimanov).  Since we're refusing to play 3 d4, that means 3 b3 (or 3 d3).  Still, these are not bad choices, and I can understand why Kaufman recommends them.<br /><br />Against 1 d4 (and in many cases, 1 c4 or 1 Nf3 since White often starts with any of these moves to get into a Queen's Gambit), Kaufman recommends the Semi-Slav, and the variation 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 c6 4 Nf3 Nf6 5 e3 Nbd7 6 Bd3 dc 7 Bc4 b5 8 Bd3 Bd6 in particular.<br /><br />Still, I think the best part of this book is the defense to 1 e4.  Let's have some applause for the Berlin Defence to the Ruy Lopez, please!  Very few books devote so much space to playing it with Black (19 carefully analyzed games!).  The main line leads to an endgame where Black often has the Bishop pair (or a Bishop against a Knight).  Sometimes, the Black King winds up safely on the Queenside, on b7 or c6, supporting the Black pawn majority there (with these pawns on the opposite colored squares from White's missing Bishop).  I'd rather have Black than White in such positions.  And the whole idea is better than, say, the Marshall Gambit, because that just turns into an Anti-Marshall or an Exchange Variation much of the time.  The Berlin line is 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 (3 Bc4 Bc5) Nf6 4 0-0 (4 Qe2 Bc5) Ne4 5 d4 (5 Re1 Nd6 6 Ne5 Ne5 7 Re5+ Be7 8 Nc3 0-0) Nd6 6 Bc6 (6 de Nb5 7 a4 Nbd4) dc 7 de Nf5 8 Qd8+ Kd8 9 Nc3.

In the more than 20 years since it came out, the Center Counter has been played in high level chess more than in the previous century.  And I think the book gets off to an inauspicious start by omitting the Black Queen from its very first diagram.<br /><br />The part on 2...Qxd5 is weak overall, with the portion on 2...Qxd5 3 Nc3 Qd6 especially so.  That didn't bother me much, given that I play 2...Nf6, but it might annoy others.  Even in the section on 2...Nf6, the Icelandic gambit with 3 c4 e6 is dismissed outright (and that's the line I play!) while the very popular Portuguese gambit line of 3 d4 Bg4 is not even mentioned (luckily, I don't play it).  And there is no treatment of the Panov attack, so those who want to try the alternative of 2...Nf6 3 c4 c6 won't have a suggestion about what to do next when White plays 4 d4 cd 5 Nc3.<br /><br />Still, if you play the Center Counter, I think you ought to have this book.  You'll need more than this one, though.  Maybe the best recent one is the second edition (2004) of \\"the scandinavian\\" by John Emms.  For those of you who play 2...Qxd5, you may want to try \\"The Essential Center Counter,\\" by Andrew Martin.	2005-01-10

And this is indeed my main defence, so much so that I feel I could almost write a book on \\"My Life as a Scandinavian.\\"<br /><br />For the record, I play and recommend the following lines for Black:<br /><br />1 e4 d5 2 ed Nf6 3 c4 e6 (the Icelandic Gambit) 4 de (4 d4 ed 5 Nc3 Bb4) Be6 5 Nf3 (5 d4 Bb4+ 6 Bd2 Bd2+) Qe7 6 Qe2 Nc6 7 d4 Bg4<br /><br />1 e4 d5 2 ed Nf6 3 Bb5+ Bd7 4 Bc4 Bg4 5 f3 Bf5 6 Nc3 Nbd7<br /><br />1 e4 d5 2 ed Nf6 3 Nc3 Nd5 4 Bc4 Nb6 5 Bb3 Nc6 6 Nf3 e5<br /><br />1 e4 d5 2 ed Nf6 3 d4 Nd5 4 c4 Nb6 5 Nf3 Bg4 6 Be2 (6 c5 N6d7) Nc6<br /><br />1 e4 d5 2 Nc3 de 3 Ne4 Bf5<br /><br />1 e4 d5 2 e5 c5<br /><br />1 e4 d5 2 d4 (Blackmar Gambit) de 3 Nc3 Nf6<br /><br />1 e4 d5 2 Nf3 (trying for a Budapest Reversed?) de 3 Ng5 Bf5 4 Bc4 e6 5 Nc3 Nf6<br /><br />Still, if you want to rely on this opening for Black, you ought to read some other books as well.

It contains 72 analyzed games, 47 of which are from 1998 or later.  It definitely presents a modern assessment of this defence.	2005-01-10

He then tells of his political hero, Vladimir Jabotinsky, who advocated free enterprise, possessed a \\"deeply rooted liberalism\\" and strongly objected to \\"acts of an extra-legal nature.\\"  While Jabotinsky in fact approved of \\"illegal\\" immigration into what is now Israel, that was only if all other channels were closed.  And Jabotinsky was equally opposed to \\"evacuating\\" Arabs and to creating a binational state with them.<br /><br />By 1935, the 20-year old Shamir was already in the Levant.  Why?  Because Josef Goebbels had planned a visit to Warsaw.  That was the last straw for Shamir.  On hearing the news of this, he left Poland at once.<br /><br />As Shamir explains, the 1939 White Paper that basically shut down Jewish immigration to the Levant earned the British his \\"profound hostility.\\"  While he explains that he has never hated people, he then realized that the Jews of the area had to be rid of the British, and that an alliance with the British would not work.  Shamir then joined the Stern Gang.  In perhaps the best line in the book, Shamir says that he has always believed that \\"war is a conflict between the forces of evil.\\"  You read this and you wait for the second half of the sentence...maybe he'll say that it is between the forces of evil and those of good, or something.  But there is no second half to the sentence.<br /><br />The author then tells of the war against the British, \\"a war fought not for territory or glory but for immigration certificates for Jews.\\"<br /><br />The book then explains how Shamir went from being a leader of an outlawed group to a responsible citizen.  The biggest step came in 1955, when he joined the Mossad.  This gave him a chance to use the leadership skills he had developed in the Stern Gang to work for a responsible government.  After that, he slowly managed to get into normal politics.<br /><br />Shamir makes a few points that are worth remembering.  First, the dismantling of Yamit was a very bad precedent, not just for Jews or Israel, but in general.  Second, the American media generally show unfairness towards Israel.  Third, the nature of the dispute with the Arabs is not territorial: Israel's 28,000 square kilometers not being excessive compared with the 14,000,000 square kilometers belonging to the Arabs, whose population is not even 50 times that of the Jews, let alone 500 times.<br /><br />The author explains his opposition to the disastrous Oslo agreement.  And he concludes that he can only hope that the people of Israel, whose judgment and endurance he trusts, \\"will look for, and find, alternative paths - even if they are rockier and steeper - to lead them to a viable peace that has not been bought with their security, their land, or their rights.\\"<br /><br />I agree with these sentiments, and I recommend this book.ls he had developed in the Stern Gang to work for a responsible government.

And that, yes, they can actually be trained to kill people when necessary.  That they do not use their twenty-two caliber pistols just to scare people, but to fire two shots, with no pause between them, at a human target.<br /><br />But why?<br /><br />Jonas tells us why.  Because after the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972, no other nations were prepared to help bring eleven of the surviving murderers to justice.  Jonas also tells us what sorts of people become counter-terrorists.  They must be loyal and courageous.  But not goons, not psychopaths, and not super-sophisticated James Bond types.  Not too imaginative: that produces too much doubt.  Not too daring: that causes incaution.  Not too fanatical: that makes one unstable.  And the author reminds us that whether one's cause is good or bad, terrorism is not the way to pursue it and counter-terrorism is a proper and moral response.<br /><br />Jonas also addresses the issue of whether counter-terrorism actually produces peace.  Usually it does not, just as police pursuit of criminals rarely stops all crime.  On the other hand, I think we can all see the problems with letting murderers roam the world untouched, boasting of their crimes, openly recruiting people to the cause of murdering innocent civilians, and being treated as heroes by the media and other admirers.<br /><br />In this exciting tale, we find out what happens when one tries to avenge the spectacular murders of some innocent civilians.  We see that some targets are basically \\"soft.\\"  One can discover their whereabouts without much trouble and simply kill them.  But a few are \\"hard,\\" and are very professional at staying alive.  It is very difficult for a small team to kill even one such person.  And indeed, this team found it next to impossible.  On top of that, if one begins by killing one or more soft targets, the terrorists will fight back, with assassins going after the counter-terrorists.<br /><br />I recommend this book.  I think it has a moral, namely that rather than use small counter-terrorism squads, we'd all be better off if there were some international cooperation in apprehending terrorists and bringing them to justice.terrorists will fight back, with assassins going after the counter-terrorists.   <br /> <br />I recommend this book.

Anyone interested in Jupiter will find it readable.  And some of the information will appeal to specialists as well.<br /><br />An introduction gives a short history of observations of the planet, including the robotic missions of Pioneer and Voyager.  After that, there is a chapter on Jupiter's atmosphere and another on the famous Red Spot.  Beebe then tells about the problems in modeling the interior of the rapidly rotating Jupiter.  And we find out more about modeling of the upper atmosphere.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the part about spectrographic measurements of the hydrogen and helium in Jupiter's atmosphere.  You see, spectrographic analysis gave a mass ratio of 21% to 22% of Helium in the Jovian atmosphere.  But Beebe tells us that the Galileo Probe in situ observation was more like 25% Helium.  That is actually important.  It turns out that a very straightforward calculation of Big Bang nucleosynthesis predicts a minimum of 23% to 24% primordial Helium in the universe.  The percentage of Helium in Jupiter ought to be a little higher than the primordial one.  So it could be that the Big Bang calculation of 23% to 24% is indeed right on the money.  On top of that, as Beebe points out, the Probe results could confirm that there is enough mixing in the upper Jovian atmosphere to prevent much Helium from separating out and falling to lower elevations.<br /><br />Beebe continues with a description of Jupiter's satellites and ring.  By the way, I would like to point out that many more satellites of Jupiter have been discovered since her book was written.  Those discovered in 2000 include Kalyke, Harpalyke, Isonoe, Taygete, Themisto, Praxidike, and Magaclite.  Those discovered in 2001 include Aitne, Hermippe, Eurydome, Thyone, Autonoe, and Euanthe.  Several more were discovered in each of those two years.  By early 2004, a total of 63 satellites of Jupiter had been found.<br /><br />The author then briefly describes the Jovian magnetosphere.

This book shows thirty great paintings by what I consider the second-best French painter of the seventeenth century (to me, but to very few others, Simon Vouet was the best).<br /><br />Those who haven't seen Georges de La Tour's paintings will be struck by the fact that the backgrounds are typically dark black.  That was his style.  He'd paint the design, starting with the light colors.  Then he would add darker colors to it.  And he'd finish up with a very dark background.<br /><br />We see people paying taxes.  We see a peasant couple.  A hurdy-gurdy player.  Brawling musicians.  Dice players.  There's a great work showing someone cheating at cards.  In the version in the Louvre, the cheat has the Ace of Diamonds behind his back.  La Tour did a copy of the painting, which is in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, but in that one, the cheat holds the Ace of Clubs!<br /><br />Some of the paintings have religious significance.  Three of them involve Magdalene and a skull.  Another shows Irene tending to the wounded Saint Sebastian.  And there are paintings of the Holy Family.  One is of Jesus and Saint Joseph in Joseph's carpenter's shop.  Another is of Saint Anne (Mary's mother) teaching Mary to read.  One more is of Anne and Jesus.  And yet another is of Anne, Mary, and Jesus.<br /><br />The detail in all these paintings is stunning.

Now that there has been a huge disaster, with a tsunami off the coast of Sumatra in 2004, we may be interested in looking at a book about tsunamis, written in 1998.<br /><br />This book boasts about the early warning system in Hawaii.  And it tells about proposals to install real-time tsunami detectors to protect Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and much of the rest of the Pacific Ocean shores.<br /><br />Dudley and Lee begin with a description of the tsunami of April 1, 1946.  48 minutes after the earthquake, a 100-foot high wave struck Unimak Island, Alaska.  Hawaii was over 2300 miles from the site of the earthquake, but it was struck less than 5 hours later, and there was considerable damage.  There is also a description of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Lisbon, Portugal in 1755, killing tens of thousands of people.<br /><br />The book then describes how the complete lack of preparedness for the 1946 tsunami led to the development of an early warning system.  This includes a \\"tsunami watch\\" and the use of the emergency broadcast system to warn everyone.  And, of course, it includes predictions of wave arrival times at various places along the shores.  In 1957, this system was tested when a 10-foot high tsunami from Alaska struck Hawaii.  Hawaii's system was tested again in 1960, on the occasion of a very high magnitude earthquake in Chile (probably the largest earthquake in the world during the twentieth century).  That generated a huge tsunami: those in Chile could have used an early warning of it!  This tsunami was 35 feet high when it eventually struck Hilo, Hawaii.  In 1964, the waves from the great Alaskan earthquake were less than a third that high when they reached Hawaii.<br /><br />The warning system was used to warn the residents of Hawaii in 1986 of a potentially damaging tsunami.  But this turned out to be a false alarm: the waves that hit Hawaii were only one to four feet high and did no damage.<br /><br />The authors explain that Indonesia has been a frequent target of tsunamis, mentioning the ones in 1992 and 1994, as well as one that struck nearby Papua New Guinea in 1998.  And it talks about the eruption of Krakatoa, which generated a tsunami that struck nearby Merak with a 135-foot high wave.<br /><br />Dudley and Lee discuss the threat of bolide-generated tsunamis (large meteor strikes).  These could produce waves several hundred feet high, over a thousand miles away.<br /><br />The book concludes with a discussion of improvements in tsunami warning systems.  Obviously, there is more work to be done!<br /><br />If you are near the beach and get hit by a big earthquake, some folks will tell you to head for the shore to get away from buildings and avoid the aftershocks.

For example, one could get the Tartakower volume of 500 games.  But I like this book, with only 112 games, a little better.<br /><br />The book makes use of analyses from the players and others.  More important, the authors used a few good chess programs to improve their understanding of these games.  That's a big plus.  And so, what we see is a bunch of really good fights.<br /><br />Is this the best way to learn chess?  Well, tough fights are a big part of chess.  There is more to chess than that, of course.  There are books that show how to get big advantages in the opening against tepid play by one's opponent.  There are even a few that show how to try to get draws with White against stronger opponents.  And there are books that show how to restrict your opponent to a few lines that you can learn extremely well, so that you can survive the opening against anyone weaker than a Master.<br /><br />Still, this book has games by some great players, and it is fun to play through them.  In addition, a few of the games have openings that may have special appeal to some readers.  There are more than twenty Sicilian defences, and seven Semi-Slav defences.<br /><br />The nine players (in alphabetical order) that have at least six games in this book are Anand, Capablanca, Fischer, Karpov, Kasparov, Lasker, Spassky, Tal, and Topalov.  Fans of those players will get to see some detailed analyses of some of their best games.<br /><br />How strong does one need to be to get anything out of this book?  Well, I have a simple answer for that.  You need to be a candidate expert (an \\"A-player\\") or at least aspire to be one.  If you plan to improve at chess, why not see what good chess looks like and see what kinds of styles of play appeal to you?  If you are really ambitious, do some of your own analysis and see if you can come up with better lines.<br /><br />I recommend this book.book.	2005-01-04

Terrorism is indeed, as Netanyahu says, \\"the deliberate and systematic murder, maiming, or menacing of the innocent to inspire fear for political ends.\\"<br /><br />Those who support terrorism tend to reply that actually, those who fight terrorism are the terrorists.  And that the real question to ask is \\"what drives such good people to commit acts Netanyahu calls 'terrorism?'\\"  And the most famous line, that one Man's terrorist is another Man's freedom fighter.  Um, right.  And one Woman's cat is another Woman's dog, I suppose!  A better analogy might be that one person's policeman is another person's robber.  Well, there is a difference between terrorists and those who oppose them.  And it is counterproductive to give in to terrorist demands.  That is what this book is about.<br /><br />There are over three dozen contributors.  George Shultz focuses on the need for better intelligence.  I agree: that would have helped avert 9/11.  Benzion Netanyhau points out that the PLO can't be freedom fighters, given that they fight for oppression rather than against it.  Paul Johnson says we must have courage to deny hiding places to terrorists.  Daniel Moynahan explains that there is a justification to go after terrorists internationally, given that terrorism opposes both freedom and human rights.  Alain Bescancon shows how Russian terrorists in the 1870s obtained public support.  Leszek Kowalski says that state-supported terror is simply war and ought to be treated as such.  Jeane Kirkpatrick argues that terrorist victories lead to the establishment of totalitarian states.<br /><br />There is a section on Islamic terrorism.  Bernard Lewis tells us about the Assassins.  It's worth remembering that their goals were arbitrary and are long forgotten.  After that, we see the connection between domestic terror and international terrorism.  Then there is a section on international terrorism.  Jillian Becker tells us about how Europeans could come to Lebanon as guests of the PLO, be given rifles, shoot some civilians with impunity just for fun, and go home without any fear of reprisals.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important section is on terrorism and the media.  Charles Krauthammer explains how the terrorists have made those in the media \\"partners in crime.\\"  And he advises that the media at least avoid romancing terror.  John O'Sullivan wants to deny publicity to terrorists.  And Lord Chalfont reminds those in the media that when the terrorists win, the first freedom that will be taken away will be that of the press.  A short panel discussion of terror and the media is at the end of the book.<br /><br />The following section deals with the legality of fighting terror, including rights of \\"hot pursuit.\\"  Meir Shamgar recommends an international convention against terrorism.  After that, there are articles about domestic terrorism and global terrorism.  Alan Cranston discusses the threat of nuclear terrorist states.  Yitzhak Rabin recommends starting a U.S.-led international agency against terrorism.  Midge Decter warns us that if we lose the battle to the terrorists, those in the future will not say of us that we were too noble and good to fight.  They'll say we were too morally lazy to keep freedom alive for them.  Jack Kemp reminds us not to draw a false symmetry between us and those who terrorize us.  Benjamin Netanyahu has an important point to make: the more scared we are of civilian casualties, the more terrorists will attack civilians and use civilians as shields.  And the net result may well be even more civilian casualties.<br /><br />This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it.lian Becker tells us about how Europeans could come to Lebanon as guests of the PLO, be given rifles, shoot some civilians with impunity just for fun, and go home without any fear of reprisals.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important section is on terrorism and the media.

This is not really an \\"alternative history\\" book.  It takes place in the 1998 and it was written in 2004.  The action could equally well have taken place six years later.  Nor is it a time-travel book: the characters don't really go backwards in time or anything like that.  Nor is it really a science fiction book.  After all, there is a weird change after which people still function but electricity does not, solar energy works but dynamite does not, guns won't fire because gunpowder burns too slowly, and gasoline engines won't work but gasoline burns rather well, thank you!  Kerosine, twigs, and matches burn normally.  Meanwhile, hot air balloons work but steam engines don't work.  I was waiting to find out if airguns still worked!<br /><br />No, this is a fantasy book, where the laws of nature haven't merely changed, but no longer seem to make any sense or be consistent.  And there are all sorts of unlikely coincidences in the story.  Still the characters do make sense.  Many of them fight for their lives and for the lives of their loved ones.  And the motivations of the characters made at least as much sense as those in most of the other catastrophe fiction books I've read.<br /><br />I found the book captivating, and I liked the characters.  And I was very happy to read a book that had a Wiccan heroine and a favorable treatment of Wicca in general.<br /><br />If you are thinking of getting this book, do so!  You'll really enjoy it.	2005-01-02
404627:US	53071109	R3JNYKLM4UAF8S	0895267462	835931498	Red Horizons: The True Story of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescus' Crimes, Lifestyle, and Corruption	Books	5	12	13	N	N	An interesting look at Romania's Ceausescu regime	Anyone who spent even a few months in Romania when Ceausescu ran it knows that it was very poorly governed.  Some symptoms of this were the long lines, the empty shelves in the food stores, the lack of so many consumer goods, the dollar shops, the Securitate, the eagerness of so many citizens to emigrate (and the difficulty of getting visas), the lack of Western newspapers and magazines and the weakness of currency by Western standards.  There were also the searches for contraband items at the borders, such as calculators, Bibles, or coffee.  Bribery appeared to be part of the culture.  Yes, a few people in the government were relatively well off, but very few others were.<br /><br />In my opinion, one reason for the situation was the quality of those who ran the nation.  Some Romanian communists, including Ceausescu, were Communists even when Romania was allied with Germany in World War Two.  Back then, Communists were not exactly public servants: generally, they were misfits.  When the Communists were victorious, these misfits wound up running the country, and they did a poor job of it.<br /><br />In this book, written before Ceausescu was overthrown, Pacepa gives us some evidence (albeit, much of it anecdotal) that the Ceausescu regime was repressive and irresponsible in many respects.<br /><br />We see Ceausescu giving very detailed advice and support to Arafat, a terrorist leader.  We see some of the greed the Ceausescus were notorious for, as they stashed away huge amounts of money and goods.  And we see that the Ceausescu government was a special threat to minorities such as Hungarians, Jews, and Germans.<br /><br />This book was written well over 15 years ago, but I think it needs to be looked at even today, perhaps to remind us how counterproductive governments can be.	2005-01-02

That includes a discussion of stromatolites (early life), and some interesting comments about guesses of the odds of life appearing in a stellar system in the Galaxy.  While estimates that hold the chances to be small are taken seriously, Fred Hoyle's argument that the chance is outrageously small is shown to be silly.<br /><br />The author then describes the nature and diversity of life in general, and its resiliance to a variety of natural catastrophes, including bolide impacts and supernovae.<br /><br />Smil tells us about how the biosphere is energized, by solar radiation and the Earth's internal heat.  And we then see the flows of water and materials, including carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and other mineral cycles.  The next two chapters deal with the extent of the biosphere and the biosphere's mass and productivity.  There are organisms that range up to 50 km above the surface of our planet, or to the bottom of the oceans, nearly 11 km down.  To tens of meters below the land surface.  And at temperatures ranging from 110 degrees Celsius to minus 50.  pH ranges can be from 1 to 11.  Meanwhile, the biomass may be anywhere from 2200 to 4000 Gigatons of Carbon.<br /><br />There is a chapter on the dynamics and organization of the biosphere, including the quarter-power scaling of animal and plant metabolism \\"that applies across an entire range of body sizes and metabolic pathways.\\"<br /><br />After that, Smil discusses the transformation of the biosphere due to human actions, such as the release of sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon into the atmosphere.  The book concludes with some ideas about the future of the biosphere.  He speculates that the Earth's population will stabilize at well below 10 billion people and that there needs to be a transition \\"from fossil fuels to solar radiation as the dominant source of human energy needs.\\"  Meanwhile, there are problems to face: we humans are awfully prone to violence, there may be a new ice age, we could be hit by a big bolide, and so forth.  Still, the author is mentions that the biosphere might prove surprisingly resiliant to what is being done to it at present.<br /><br />There are a few useful appendices, covering milestones in the evolution of the Earth and its biosphere, sizes and masses of organisms, chemical reactions in the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles, and ocean and land estimates of the biosphere's phytomass, heterotrophic biomass, and net primary productivity,  There's also a list of useful websites.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic.ominant source of human energy needs.\\"  Meanwhile, there are problems to face: we humans are awfully prone to violence, there may be a new ice age, we could be hit by a big bolide, and so forth.

About a mile from this bomb, he survived just by luck.<br /><br />About 400,000 people were in the Hiroshima area at the time.  Of them, 232,000 are said to have died either directly from the bombing or, eventually, from radiation-induced illnesses.<br /><br />Nakazawa eventually became a cartoonist and this book is the first in a Manga series that describes Hiroshima and his family before the bombing and afterwards.  It is an extremely powerful look at a militaristic culture and the insanity of war.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this amazing book.  Matter of fact, I recommend the entire series.	2005-01-01

In the past 2000 years, there have been about 200 expulsions of Jews from nations: about one every ten years.  He then goes on to quote a number of antizionists whose idea is simple: we outnumber the Jews, so we ought to get everything and they ought to get nothing!<br /><br />The next topic is the false symmetry of Israel and its attackers and between \\"attempts to destroy a community and the reprisals that the community must resort to in self-defence.\\"  Givet goes on to explain the arbitrariness of having Arab refugees cooped up in UN camps for decades while millions of refugees everywhere else in the world generally get resettled in a matter of a few weeks.<br /><br />The author explains that an antisemitic government \\"discredits itself in all its doings.\\"  And he tells Jews that \\"only by working for their own national liberation will they join the mainstream of the forces now working for greater freedom in society at large.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile for antizionists, the Arabs are the heroes, not because any of them care for Arabs per se but because \\"the Arabs deny (and are encouraged by the anti-Zionists to deny) the human and political rights to which the Jews aspire.\\"<br /><br />I was amazed by the extent to which Middle Eastern Christians condemn Jewish nationalism outright.  All too typical is a quote the author finds of the Director of the \\"Journal for the Study of International Relations\\" who explains that Jerusalem is an Arab city of which its legitimate sovereign has been despoiled.  This Director goes on to say that \\"in fact, Jerusalem, a Holy City, is also, and above all, an Arab town.  A Holy Place in which the spirit walks, it does not exist remote from the contingencies of time and space.  It is a city of men and women.\\"<br /><br />I've never forgotten the implication that Jerusalem, the Jewish capital which has had a Jewish majority since the 1870s, is an Arab town!  Nor that Jews are not men and women but something else entirely.  I wonder if Pagans are men and women?<br /><br />Well, is there anything wrong with saying, as Maxime Rodinson does, that the Arabs \\"could do no other than dream of destroying the state of Israel?\\"  You bet there is!  Givet explains that such a statement is anti-scientific, pessimistic, anti-dialectical, arbitrary, retrograde, debasing (to Arabs), and irresponsible.  In addition, it reveals a static outlook, is opposed to progress, and shows a lack of discrimination and contempt for facts.  And, of course, it is an unreasonable generalization: not all Arabs are the same!<br /><br />Givet is at his best when he comes up with the start of a glossary used by antizionists.  These words (such as aggression, colonialism, jus soli, land, refugees, resistance, settlement, and territories) are always used to mock Jews and give unjustified praise to antizionists.<br /><br />This is an excellent little book, and I highly recommend it.>I've never forgotten the implication that Jerusalem, the Jewish capital which has had a Jewish majority since the 1870s, is an Arab town!

406811:US	53071109	R3U6LH8XB5QFV1	0880641320	288204490	The Satanizing of the Jews: Origin and Development of Mystical Anti-Semitism	Books	5	5	8	N	N	An excellent description of mystical antisemitism	This is an interesting look at \\"mystical anti-semitism.\\"  It starts with the Roman-Jewish war and the formation of the Christian Church.  Carmichael shows us the viciousness of the early Christian leaders (such as John Chrysostom) towards the Jews.  Chrysostom said that \\"God hates the Jews forever\\" because the Jews murdered Jesus.  Christianity did condemn the Jews to semi-serfdom, but since Jews were rarely considered heretics (such as the Catharists, Albigensians, Luciferians, Neo-Manicheans, Waldensians, or Passagii), the Jews were not wiped out or all forced to convert.<br /><br />The story continues into Protestant times, where Luther showed great ferocity against Jews but Calvinism was willing to tolerate Jews.  And the author makes the point that we ought not be surprised that some Jews did indeed survive the Middle Ages, given that mass murders of Jews were far enough apart so that the Jewish community had a chance to regroup.  Next, we get into secular times, where Voltaire is used as an example.  For Voltaire, the Jews were to be condemned not because they killed Jesus but because they wrote the Bible, produced Jesus, produced the Christians, and sent away the Roman civilization, along with the Roman Goddesses and Gods.  While I understand Voltaire's criticism, I can't agree with it.  We non-monotheists ought to be busy inviting the Goddesses and Gods to return to us, not busy blaming the Jews (rather than ourselves) for sending them away.<br /><br />After that, we get to some new ideas: pseudo-scientific claims about an Inferior Race (of Jews, of course).  And that leads to a discussion of antisemitism in Germany in World War Two and in Soviet Russia.  The book concludes with an analysis of the support for anti-semitism from left wing movements, including from left-wing Jews.<br /><br />I happen to disagree with Carmichael on some topics.  I know that three millenia ago, the Jews may have been characterized by their opposition to child sacrifice and to Sun-worship (and to Paganism in general).  But nowadays, I think the overall perception of what Jews are is defined as much by Christians and Muslims as by the Jews themselves.<br /><br />In addition, I think it is no accident that some non-Christians survived the Middle Ages.  There were always some people who could not abide Christian rituals, or the divinity of Jesus, or simply refused the idea of taking orders from Roman priests.  One could avoid all this by becoming (or remaining) Jewish.  Dissent could not always be prevented, and this option was often open.  Judaism was a coherent enough choice that it would have been very difficult to completely annihilate it.  Perhaps if Christianity had been demonstrably True and Judaism False, that would have made a difference, but to most dissenters, Christianity seemed about as far from truth as possible.<br /><br />So I see both Judaism and antisemitism as a little less special than Carmichael does.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I think it is a great book, and I highly recommend it.n-worship (and to Paganism in general).

But until my son managed to get the rest of the family to try playing this game, I had no idea what it was all about.  All I knew was one of the first things Warren tells us: you can't win by checking and calling.  You have to play more aggressively.<br /><br />Well, this book teaches one to play low limit, especially against, um, other beginners.  And the book expands on some fundamental principles:<br /><br />1)  Play only really high hands in early positions.<br />2)  Avoid playing low cards.<br />3)  Rarely bluff, especially against unsophisticated opponents.<br />4)  Play very solidly before the flop.<br />5)  Fold against a raise pre-flop unless you think can beat the raiser head-up at that point.<br />6)  See the flop as cheaply as possible.<br /><br />The last of these points surprised me.  I would have guessed that it would be better to raise with A-K and maybe check-raise with a pair of Kings or a pair of Aces.  But it seems that computer analyses have shown that the author's policy is better: while he virtually always raises with the Aces, he's much more cautious with other hands.<br /><br />By the way, the author does discuss how one ought to behave if one runs into a streak of good luck or bad luck.  While such streaks can affect one's attitude, they also may say something about the caliber of one's opposition, so don't assume there's nothing to such advice.<br /><br />The author recommends that one keep trying to improve one's game.  After I play a few more times, I'll try reading a more advanced book!	2004-12-31

Limor Livnat - The Leading Woman in Israeli Politics Speaks Her Mind	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Some good sense from Israel's Education Minister	Limor Livnat writes in this book that after the Six Day War, someone scribbled \\"Am Yisrael Chai\\" (the people of Israel live) on the Arch of Titus in Rome.<br /><br />You see, the Arch of Titus is there to celebrate the destruction of Jerusalem, over 1900 years ago.  The Roman Empire is gone.  And the Jews they went after, by no means as numerous or wealthy as the Romans, are still around.  Livnat says that this means that the Jews have \\"defied history.\\"<br /><br />I wouldn't put it quite that way.  But I do think we ought to realize that Big Empires can topple, while a much smaller people can withstand losing some battles and wars.  In particular, I wouldn't be surprised if the Jews, having outlasted the Romans, managed to outlast some of their more recent foes.<br /><br />Livnat is an Israeli politician.  I think it might be worth comparing her, especially given her role as Education Minister, with Hanan Ashrawi, who once served as Arafat's Education Minister.  Not all people are alike, and I think the contrast between these two people is enormous.  Livnat is a genuine public servant, while Ashrawi has merely been a counterproductive propagandizer.<br /><br />Livnat, speaking at the Golda Meir center in Haifa, says that women can be leaders.  And that they can be feminists as well.  The Knesset is dominated by men right now.  Livnat feels that there is no reason why it couldn't be half women and half men.  Neither do I.  And she points out that there are some attitude changes that may need to be made to accomplish this.  But she insists that \\"a woman can be a feminist and religious, a feminist and a capitalist, a feminist and an astronaut, or a feminist and a quilt-maker.\\"  I strongly agree.<br /><br />As for leadership, maybe that would be a problem if a leader always had to be the person who could lift the heaviest weight.  Luckily, that isn't the case at all.<br /><br />Livnat states her vision for the future.  She sees an Israel that will defend and protect Jews both in Israel and elsewhere.  One which will continue to absorb immigrants from everywhere and will have stronger bonds with the Jewish diaspora.  A Jewish and democratic Israel (as she explains, that is not a contradiction) that is at peace with its neighbors.  And an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital.<br /><br />Right now, all this may look preposterous, much as Herzl's vision of a Jewish state must have seemed preposterous a century ago.  But her dream is merely one that has come true for many other small nations.<br /><br />I recommend this book.ich will continue to absorb immigrants from everywhere and will have stronger bonds with the Jewish diaspora.

It begins with some historical material on the subject.  Then there's a some characteristics of the consitituents of cells.  Lahav points out that one property of life is that all its fundamental constituents are non-living.<br /><br />After that, there is a brief but important discussion of general thermodynamic considerations, including free energy, entropy, information content of DNA, and autocatalysis.  From there, we go to a chapter on biochemical molecules and processes.  And we see Martynas Ycas' definition of a biochemical system (\\"a system of catalysts regulating the transformation of other compounds so as to make available the system energy and matter for its further increase and maintenance\\").  In addition, there's a chapter on biological life, with four pages just to compile various definitions of life.<br /><br />Now we're ready to take on the main problem.  The basic assumptions are that the physical laws are applicable and that evolution takes place at the molecular level.  The strategies include cosmogeochemical (characterizing the environments in which the first living entities formed), biological (looking for the oldest actual life forms), and biogeochemical (looking at the synthesis of biopolymers).<br /><br />Lahav supplies some clues from biology about the origin of life, including chirality, multiplicity of steps to generate life, temperature at which life originated, common origin for RNA, the citric acid cycle, and \\"evolutionary clocks.\\"  Then we get into some specific lines of attack.  The first is that ribose has a stability problem and adenine hydrolyzes.  That gets us to look at a PNA (peptide nucleic acid) world and template-directed reactions.  And we see Hartman's theory that the original code began with glycine, alanine, arginine, and proline.  And we look at the issue of the \\"error threshold\\" of a copying process.<br /><br />We then are introduced to another question: did the origin of life entail the use of minerals as scaffolds, adsorbents, catalysts, or information carriers?  That includes a discussion of Wachtershauser's \\"iron-sulfur world.\\"  And there is a look at where on Earth life could have started: volcanoes, hot springs, bulk ocean water, bubbles, atmospheric water drops, lagoons, ocean floor, ocean surface, or hydrothermal vents.<br /><br />The final chapter is about computer modeling of some biogeochemical scenarios.  The book ends with a fine list of references.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to those genuinely interested in the fascinating question of the origin of life on Earth.l the use of minerals as scaffolds, adsorbents, catalysts, or information carriers?

In a science fiction story, real science is an integral part of the story.  Real science has no connection to moving a fleet decades backwards in time.  Nor is it supposed to, nor does it have to.<br /><br />This book is very well written.  I liked the opening scenes, where it slowly dawns on the leaders of the 1942 fleet that the newcomers have awesome weapons and are good shots.  The author draws these scenes out to explain the confusion on both sides that becomes central to the rest of the book.  The depiction of the contrast between the two worlds is great.  Ask some people in their seventies about the America of their childhoods if you don't believe it.<br /><br />More than that, I like the situation it poses: what would folks do if they were in the middle of a war and some newcomers showed up from several decades into the future?  Not just one person that no one would hear about, let alone believe.  But quite a few of them!  The author showed plenty of imagination to come up with this plot, and I can't wait for the next book.	2004-12-30

Books	5	10	10	N	N	An excellent undergraduate textbook on acoustics	This is a good up-to-date engineering text on acoustics for upper division college students.  There are plenty of good exercises at the ends of the chapters.<br /><br />The author points out that acoustics has changed in the past twenty years to encompass ultrasonics and infrasonics.  There are a number of new \\"applications in materials science, medicine, dentistry, oceanography, marine navigation, communications, petroleum and mineral prospecting, industrial processes, music and voice synthesis, animal bioacoustics, and noise control.\\"  And of course, improvements are being made in more classical parts of this field.<br /><br />To use this text, you ought to have studied lower division physics for engineers, calculus, and ordinary and partial differential equations.<br /><br />I like the fact that the book includes chapters on psychoacoustics, noise control, underwater acoustics, ultrasonics, and musical instruments.  Not all acoustics texts cover all this!  It makes this one of the more comprehensive acoustics books.  Still, I would have liked to see even more material, perhaps on topics such as shock waves or second sound in liquid helium.<br /><br />This is a well-written textbook.  I'd be happy to teach a class using it.	2004-12-29

When the first book of the prequel came out, some of the reviewers said that they wished Betancourt would write more like Zelazny had.  Well, now he seems to have taken all this to heart: this book was very much in the Zelazny style.

After a slow introductory book, there's a little more action in this one.  That makes sense, given that Oberon has to transition into a truly powerful leader to make it consistent with what we see in the Zelazny Amber series.

And it's true that Zelazny didn't write this one.  So what?<br /><br />If any fantasy series seemed to be left unfinished, it was Amber.  Betancourt is a good author and I liked his book.<br /><br />The plot is fine.  Yes, Oberon's siblings seem very much like his children.  Still, I don't see what's wrong with that.  Yes, there are some discrepancies between what we see in this book and what we may have thought we saw in Zelazny's Amber.  But most of them can be written off, given that they are only with what very untrustworthy characters said in Zelazny's Amber.<br /><br />Finally, some people thought this trilogy started a little slowly.  Well, that's just the way I like it.  Oberon is a much larger-than-life character in Amber.  We all wanted to know more about him.  Now we do.  And we all would have been frustrated to be introduced to him as a character of even more immense power and stature at the start of the first book!  I think it's better when he starts out being a little confused about what to do and about what his siblings are really like.	2004-12-29

This long work of fantasy is addictive, like some sort of soap opera.  But for those of us discouraged by reality, a good work of fantasy is a welcome break.  I found it very enjoyable, and just like many other readers, I truly wanted to walk in Amber.<br /><br />Still, there are way too many loose ends in the story.  Oberon is a major character, but we never find out much about him.  In Book Five, we're all expecting him to tell us what he has been up to, but he doesn't do that.  We expect to find out more about what Corwin has been doing in the second half of the book, but we don't get that either.  And I certainly expected Dworkin to tell us more about the history of his family.<br /><br />Well, what does one do if one runs out of pages without the story having finished?  I guess one idea is to go to the internet and read the next part, a set of five short stories by Zelazny (The Salesman's Tale; The Shroudling and the Guisel; Coming to a Cord; Blue Horse, Dancing Mountains; and Hall of Mirrors).  And after that, there's the prequel from Oberon's point of view, written by John Betancourt (The Dawn of Amber, Chaos and Amber, and To Rule in Amber).  There's never going to be an end to these stories, and we're all hopelessly hooked on them, so just keep those books coming!	2004-12-29

Others state everything in more mathematical terms.  Yet others are textbooks which get one to practice the mathematics.  This book takes a different approach from any of these.<br /><br />To understand cosmology, one needs to know some mathematics.  And that would be true even if we knew all the answers to our questions.  Given that there are actually multiple models of the universe that are being used and debated, it is even more important to see the mathematics that gets used to characterize them.<br /><br />Still, this is not a textbook with problem sets.  It is more of a review text in some areas (particularly general relativity), and a supplementary book in others.  It addresses several important topics in cosmology in useful detail.<br /><br />The book begins with an overview of cosmology and a review of general relativity.  Then Islam spends a significant amount of time on the Robertson-Walker metric, with two different derivations of it.  Next, we look at Friedman models of the universe.  And then, we look at observational cosmology, with estimates and ranges for the Hubble constant and the resulting age of the universe (which hopefully comes out larger than the ages of the stars and galaxies).<br /><br />After that, Islam discusses models with a cosmological constant.  That's a good idea given that in the last few years, we have obtained more and more evidence for the existence of this (or of a dark energy term).  He then includes an interesting chapter on singularities.<br /><br />After this, there are chapters on the early universe.  That means the temperature of the early universe and big bang nucleosynthesis.  And we find out about the amounts of primordial helium and deuterium (I think these are still very intriguing issues).  The author also shows us a variety of inflationary models (I had fun comparing this chapter with what Roger Penrose said about inflation in \\"The Road to Reality\\").  Islam then gives a brief account of quantum cosmology, including a mention of the Hartle-Hawking proposal for the wave function of the \\"ground state\\" of the universe.<br /><br />The book concludes with a chapter about the distant future of the universe, including black hole evaporation and proton decay.  While such a section may seem speculative and unsophisticated, I think such topics are a genuine part of cosmology.<br /><br />This is a useful book, and I recommend it as a supplement to almost any cosmology text.rose said about inflation in \\"The Road to Reality\\").

No one has to support human rights.  I think all people ought to do so.  But different people will always see things differently.<br /><br />Still, if one is to support human rights, one has to at least try to support human rights for everyone (or at least not oppose them).  And that means supporting Zionism (or at least not opposing it).  And that gets us to the theme of this book, which consists mostly of articles encouraging us to oppose Zionism.  The authors are, for the most part, opponents of Zionism.  They don't seem to want to be a part of the Hebrew nation.  Fine.  Neither do I.  A nation is not for everyone in the world.  Nor is a religion.<br /><br />Anyway, the authors are not trying to provide constructive criticism to Zionists.  They are providing advice to humans in general, telling us not to be Zionists.  Um, why should we listen to them?  That is, I'm a human being.  I'm providing advice to humans in general, telling everyone to support Zionism.  Does that mean that those of you who don't support human rights ought to take me Seriously?  Of course not.<br /><br />In short, I see no reason why the authors have any particular credentials merely by being Jewish.  And in fact, I was struck by their emphasis on Israel.  Don't they realize that not everyone in the world is Jewish?  Don't they realize that there are Arabs and others who stand to lose quite a bit if everyone abandons support for human rights?<br /><br />The list of authors does include some Zionists, such as Albert Einstein, Martin Buber, and Ahad Ha-Am.  These people supported Jewish nationalism in one way or another.  And they wrote before the establishment of modern Israel, when Jewish nationalism did not need to include support for the existence of a Jewish state.  However, the more recent contributors are a little different.  And while I could argue against their politics, and even more against their facts and logic, my point is that they rarely have anything to offer to those who support human rights.<br /><br />So when Tony Judt basically wants Israel to give up on being a state where Jews will be guaranteed rights of life, liberty, property, and immigration, he's overlooking the fact that he's setting a precedent for removing rights from everyone, not just from Israeli Jews.  When Ella Shohat misrepresents the Arab-Israeli conflict, she is doing a big disservice to the very people she says she wants to help, the Sephardim.<br /><br />More amusingly, when a very diplomatic (and to my mind, uncontroversial) statement by Lawrence Summers draws an amazing blast from Judith Butler, I think Butler misses a big opportunity to say something, anything, of value.  There are plenty of statements that are worthy of criticism.  Why on Earth go after that one?<br /><br />Those of you who aren't sure about how some of the authors stand on equality ought to ask themselves what solutions they would come up with if they did not know who they were.  What if you did not know whether you were rich, poor, Arab, Israeli, Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Pagan, young, old, woman, man, religious, secular, or whatever?  What kind of solution would you see as fair then?  What if you had to demand the same rights for everyone, not more for yourself or less for yourself?  Would you still decide to deprive Israeli Jews of the rights you demanded for Arabs?<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are plenty of articles by rather bright authors in this book.  And there are a few perceptive statements mixed in with the propaganda.  In particular, I loved it when Noam Chomsky demolished the idea that \\"the rightness of a political idea is never absolute.\\"  He's right about that!  No matter how absurd things are, we must always remind ourselves that truth, justice, and fairness are never incorrect, even if they are out of fashion or unachievable at the moment.

There are plenty of ideas in this book.  And I think it is worth reading, even though I rarely agreed with Roy's arguments or his conclusions.<br /><br />The author begins by saying that \\"culturalists\\" say that \\"Islam is the issue.\\"  And he disagrees with them.  Yes, the culturalists include just about everyone: Islamists, moderate Muslims, Islamophobes, anti-Islamophobes, and orientalists.  But not him.  He's not so sure it even makes sense to discuss a Muslim culture.  And he sees what most of us think of as Islamic struggles actually being examples of nationalism and ethnicity.  While Islam may provide some people with a sense of identity, he points out that in the war against Israel, there's no real difference politically between the seculars and the Islamists.  And he asks if jihad is really closer to Marx (Karl, not Harpo or Groucho) than it is to the Koran.<br /><br />I sort of blinked when I read that.  While it might be true, I didn't quite agree with Roy's logic.  He continued by explaining that the Chechens and the Levantine Arabs are engaged in liberation struggles.  I think he's wrong about the Levantine Arabs.  I see their struggle as being neither pro-religious, nor pro-nationalistic, nor even pro-ethnic, but very specifically anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-ethnic, and against human rights.  Roy calls the Levantine Arabs a people, but I see them as an antipeople who have no positive goals for themselves that need to be satisfied but only goals of hurting a people they have banded together to fight.  All this is quite the opposite of a liberation struggle.  And using Islam as a means to get people to identify with one side in this fight does indeed make Islam at least part of the issue.<br /><br />Roy continues by discussing the fact that Muslims still come up with polemics against competing religions.  According to the author, Christians, for the most part, do not.  Well, the Catholics do not.  The Evangelicals and the Christian Right Wing do.  And Roy concludes that the Christians aren't really competing against Islam.  But once again, I think he's overlooking the possibility that some people might consider polemics to be poor form.  I'm as willing as anyone to discuss the advantages of polytheism over monotheism.  But I do not want to appear as though I am trying to impose religious practices on others.<br /><br />Next, the author discusses the Westernization of Islam.  Some of this section was quite interesting, especially the age-old differences between Sufis and Salafis.  And later, there is a section on the future of Muslim terrorism and questions of deterritorialization.  Once again, I had to ask what he really meant by that.  Muslim terrorists exist in time and space just like the rest of us.  At best, he meant to differentiate between explicit state support and implicit support from many of the people in a state.<br /><br />Near the end of the book, Roy says that this is a time of great intellectual confusion.  As an example, anti-imperialist \\"supporters\\" of Women's Rights support the Taliban!  Well, if he thinks he is confused, that is fine.  I'm not.  If you support the Taliban, you do not support Women's Rights.<br /><br />Yes, it is true that some Christian moderates are in an alliance with some Muslim fundamentalists.  Some of them appear to be in this alliance to fight against Christian fundamentalists and Jews.  And it may be interesting to see why.  And yes, some Jewish moderates and Christian fundamentalists are allied as well, just to defend themselves.  Once again, it may be interesting to see if these alliances extend to anything more than that.  And I think it could be a good idea to investigate the very rare alliances of Muslim moderates and Jewish fundamentalists.  But I think Roy has not offered us much merely by saying that there are alliances which cut across religious and political boundaries.<br /><br />I found the book interesting, and I think it contains some intriguing facts.ns some intriguing facts.	2004-12-28

This is an excellent book on solar sailing.  What I like best about it is that it gives not only useful results for several mission application case studies but the means to derive those results for oneself.<br /><br />The book begins with a history of the topic and some possible applications, as well as some brief comparisons with other forms of propulsion and a couple of important performance metrics (in particular, the characteristic acceleration).  Next is a discussion of radiation pressure, where we start by being carefully walked through the calculation of the force on a perfectly reflecting sail.  That gets us in the right mood to examine radiative transfer methods, effects of a non-zero area for the solar disc, and solar sail force models for realistic sails.<br /><br />After that, McInnes discusses solar sail design parameters, sail materials, sail structures, and sail configurations.  That includes an excellent introduction to packing, deployment, and control issues.<br /><br />Now we get to my favorite chapters: solar sail orbital dynamics, for both Keplerian and non-Keplerian orbits (both Sun-centered and planet-centered).  The whole point of using solar sails is to make good use of a small but constant thrust, so a main application is to \\"levitate\\" the orbit above the Sun or above a planet.  McInnes examines the characteristics, controllabilty, and stability of some of these orbits.  And he then obtains results for orbits near Lagrange points (both planetary and lunar).<br /><br />Few books in any field do as good a job at getting the reader up to speed on a topic.

As the author explains, an individual act of terror does not have to be very expensive.  That's easy to believe.  After all, many people could wreak havoc just with items they already possess, such as cars and rifles.  And, as Ehrenfeld says, even a very sophisticated and deadly attack such as that of September 11, 2001, has been estimated to have cost only 500,000 dollars.<br /><br />But we're not dealing with a few isolated attacks.  We're dealing with a terror network that needs plenty of money for recruitment, training camps, housing, equipment, bribes, weapons, and various day-to-day expenses.  And the author says that the total cost of maintaining the entire Islamist terror network is in the billions of dollars.  Where does this money come from?  And what can be done to stop it?<br /><br />We learn that the money comes from governments, such as those of Saudi Arabia and Iran, from charitable organizations, from legitimate businesses operating as fronts, from investments ... and from criminal activities.  Ehrenfeld identifies some of the organizations and banks that terrorists have used, and she pays particular attention to terrorrist use of drug money.<br /><br />The author explains the PLO, an infamous terrorist group, had received 5.5 billion dollars in outright aid from the international community, including over 2.5 billion dollars from Europe.  I was shocked that the European community couldn't find something much more productive to do with two and a half billion dollars than fund terror.<br /><br />Ehrenfeld recommends adoption of an international integrity standard.  Corrupt nations could be given economic penalties.  Audits could show where money is actually going.  And if we are honest about who our enemies are, we could cut off funds to them.  She reminds us that if we do nothing, on the grounds that the problems are too small to be worth fighting, one day these problems may be too large to fight.  If we fight against evil, we may save not only ourselves, but large numbers of people who are at present oppressed by their own corrupt governments.<br /><br />This book is certainly worth reading.ple who are at present oppressed by their own corrupt governments.

He's a Christian, and he starts by trying to explain the significance of the Crusades.  He admits that the Crusaders were brutal and the Crusades were counterproductive.  But why would a few Crusades, several hundred years ago, account for so much Islamic rage against the West today?  Catherwood explains that they don't.  Instead, he says the answer lies in Western colonization in the past century or so.<br /><br />As a Pagan, I find the transition of Christianity from a popular religion to a State religion a great tragedy.  Once having the power of a state, Christianity was able to field armies to annihilate Pagans.  But Catherwood has a different perspective.  He points out that before Christianity was a state religion, it spread like wildfire.  Once it was a state religion, serious evangelism beyond Europe's borders pretty much stopped for a thousand years.  To put it mildly, I had never thought of it that way before.<br /><br />The author gives a good summary of Islam.  He encourages us to realize that Muslims have a wide variety of beliefs and attitudes.  And he warns us not to look only at the extremists (or, as he admits that Karen Armstrong does, look only at the most moderate Muslims).  Catherwood then gets to political Islam.  Here, he points out that many Islamic leaders have no national responsibilities.  That can make them more reckless.<br /><br />Still, the author has to come to terms with what political Islam has been doing.  And here, he runs into a problem.  While terrorist attacks are surely evil, just where can he draw the line?  After all, as a Christian, he sees non-Christians as wrong, in some non-trivial sense of the word.  I think this makes his case weaker when he faults extremist Muslims for attacking Western values, or for accepting arbitrary propaganda, or simply for demanding to be treated as special and demanding that non-Muslims be dhimmis.<br /><br />It's an interesting book, and I enjoyed reading it.d demanding that non-Muslims be dhimmis. <br /> <br />It's an interesting book, and I enjoyed reading it.	2004-12-27

It was made possible when the 30-year declassification period expired in 1997 and all sorts of material became available to historians.<br /><br />Given that Egypt ought to have been aware of Israel's recalcitrance to fight and Israel's military strength, it has long been puzzling that Egypt committed acts of war that seemed highly likely to provoke an all-out Israeli response.  It has also been puzzling that Jordan went along with the war, even when it stood to lose territory.  And it was even puzzling that Syria kept shelling Israel during the early parts of the war when it stood to lose the Golan.  But Oren shows how it all happened.<br /><br />We see some preliminary skirmishes in which Syria provoked an Israeli reply.  And false Soviet warnings of an Israeli buildup against Syria.  We also see that Egyptian President Nasser was aware that there was no such Israeli buildup but in May of 1967  went ahead with kicking the UNEF forces out of the Sinai anyway.  Nasser might have been prepared to risk an undesired war to do this.  However, he then continued by closing the Straits of Tiran, an act of war which made a major conflict very likely.  That would have been truly illogical had Nasser's intention been to avoid war.  And we discover that Nasser did indeed plan a first strike (Operation Dawn) that was cancelled in the last few hours only because Nasser feared that the plan had been compromised.  That allowed Israel to get away with its failure to act at once when Egypt closed the Straits.  In June, Israel gained a big advantage by striking Egypt first and destroying two thirds of the Egyptian air force on the ground.<br /><br />While there are excellent descriptions of exactly how the war proceeded, the most interesting questions Oren answers are when and how Israel made the decisions to liberate the rest of Jerusalem, capture the West Bank, and take the Golan heights from Syria.  Oren stresses that none of these events, not even the taking of all of Sinai, were in any Israeli Master Plan, and that these decisions were made on the spot.  Many other outcomes were still possible even a day after the outbreak of major hostilities.<br /><br />This is a fascinating book.  If there is any moral, it should be that ignorance can have deadly consequences.ne of these events, not even the taking of all of Sinai, were in any Israeli Master Plan, and that these decisions were made on the spot.

No.  There are numerous languages, religions, and cultures.  And not all of them have the same attitudes towards what some of us in the West see as inevitable and uniform modernization.  In addition, demographic changes raise issues such as the potential Islamization of Europe.<br /><br />Huntington warns us that all this implies that there will be cultural clashes in the future.  He says the dangerous ones \\"are likely to arise from the interaction of Western arrogance, Islamic intolerance, and Sinic assertiveness.\\"  This is indeed a controversial statement.  After all, such clashes are by no means an obvious necessity.  Nor is it at all clear that in the absence of such external issues, Western society would not have very serious internal problems with totalitarianism and wars.<br /><br />The author notes that Islam has \\"bloody borders,\\" and he gives five possible reasons for it.  First, Islam itself may be inherently aggressive.  Second, there may be the historical legacy of the creation of so many borders with non-Muslims.  Third, Islam's absolutism may be responsible.  Fourth, there is no Islamic \\"core state.\\"  And fifth, it may be simply that there has been a recent demographic explosion in many Muslim societies that has made a large number of unemployed males readily available.<br /><br />Huntington says that the future dominance of Western civilization is possible but not inevitable.  This is also a controversial statement, given that there is great uncertainty both about what Western civilization is and how powerful it really is.  And this leads to some (you guessed it, controversial) conclusions!  Huntington recommends greater cooperation among Western nations.  In addition, he wants to maintain Western technological and military superiority over other civilizations, in particular over Islamic and Sinic countries.  And he advises us to avoid interfering in the affairs of other civilizations if at all possible.<br /><br />It's an interesting book.	2004-12-26

Is it Jewish nationalism?  Is it simply an ideology of human rights for everyone, including Jews?  These are questions that I hoped would be answered (and are answered) in a book that contains articles written from 1843 to 1948 by about three dozen leading Zionists.<br /><br />A doctrine of human rights for all would permit any group, including Jews, to bid on land in and near Jerusalem and (upon obtaining it) pass laws ensuring their rights of life, liberty, and property there.  As well as continued immigration.  I wanted to see if most Zionists saw it that way, arguing that there are many Jews (and many Jewish nationalists) and that Zion is the Jewish homeland, with Jerusalem its capital.<br /><br />Moreover, I wanted to know if any of these thinkers said or implied anything like the following:<br /><br />1)  We Jews don't care for Zion, but many non-Jews do, so we'll buy Zion and displace those who really love the land.<br /><br />2)  We Zionists love Zion, so we'll steal it from the rightful and legal owners.<br /><br />3)  We don't care about human rights.  We want special treatment, so we can have privileges that are denied to non-Jews.<br /><br />Not one of these authors displayed any of the above three attitudes.  None of them advocated wastefulness, greed, destruction, theft, or unfairness.  They did indeed argue for the rights of Jews to be equal to those of other nationalities.  And they went on to discuss Jewish culture, Hebrew universities, Jewish religion, and the need for a people to have a common language and a state.  These days, when the international information supply is saturated with antizionist misinformation, it's worth noting all this.<br /><br />In this book, we see Theodor Herzl say that the Jews are a people, one people.  A people that he thinks \\"will not be left in peace.\\"  And, most important, that he is not aiming to arouse sympathy on behalf of the Jews: \\"All that is nonsense, as futile as it is dishonorable.\\"  Those who ask that we make the dubious stipulation that Zionism is merely a claim of sympathy for what has happened to the Jews of Europe might want to note that!<br /><br />We then see Ahad Ha-am say that he wants to focus on a national culture, with Zion providing merely a \\"secure refuge,\\" rather than starting with a state and relying on it to produce a national culture.  That's a good answer to those who ask today what Ahad Ha-am would have said about Israel's desire to continue to exist as a refuge for Jews.<br /><br />Two other authors who are often quoted by \\"post-Zionists\\" are Judah Magnes and Martin Buber.  I'd advise reading what they say as well.  In particular, Buber splatters Mahatma Gandhi's argument that the Levant \\"belongs to the Arabs\\" by pointing out that \\"God does not give any one portion of the Earth away.\\"  A powerful comment for those who might otherwise think that the Jews, not the Arabs, are the ones who are regarding the Levant as theirs by Divine Right!<br /><br />Vladimir Jabotinsky is often given as an example of someone who favored Jewish greed over Arab need.  Guess again!  Here we see him speak forthrightly about there being \\"no question of ousting the Arabs,\\"  And that Arabs will be a minority in Israel, but that is no hardship.  And that he asks \\"only for the same condition as the Albanians enjoy.\\"<br /><br />If you want to learn something about Zionism, read this.s dishonorable.\\"  Those who ask that we make the dubious stipulation that Zionism is merely a claim of sympathy for what has happened to the Jews of Europe might want to note that! <br /> <br />We then see Ahad Ha-am say that he wants to focus on a national culture, with Zion providing merely a \\"secure refuge,\\" rather than starting with a state and relying on it to produce a national culture.

And while some people in faraway nations may have failed to see just who the aggressors were, those who lived in Israel could not avoid noticing.<br /><br />Horovitz does a superb job of describing living with the threat of terrorist attacks.  We see how both Jews and Arabs react to all the fighting.  And he also explains the extent to which the conflict is misdescribed by many in the media.  I was shocked to discover that several star reporters were under the misimpression that the West Bank and Gaza had been some sort of independent sovereign territory prior to 1967.  Other disturbing signs were the reluctance of reporters to believe Israelis who disagreed with Arab lies, the eagerness of reporters to believe that Israel Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was some sort of wicked war criminal, and the \\"conventional wisdom\\" that Israel was to blame for the conflict since it was holding territory that it did not stake a sovereign claim to.  In addition, I was puzzled by the fact that a reporter insisted that Israel had to be held to a \\"higher standard.\\"<br /><br />The author explains how the Big Lie technique was used to accuse Israel of war crimes at, of all places, Jenin (where Israel went in with ground troops, dramatically sacrificing the lives of many soldiers to reduce Arab civilian casualties).  And he quotes Kofi Annan, who maliciously asked \\"Can the whole world be wrong (in condemning Israel)?\\"  Horovitz has a one-word answer. Yes.  Any reasonable person would, if shown the facts that European Union officials were demanding to punish Israel for trying to thwart terrorist bombings and simultaneously shown that the EU was supporting the bombers financially, letting them buy explosives with its money, would see that the EU is wrong.  His point is that a misinformed world will indeed be wrong.<br /><br />For me, the mangling of truth by the media stood out in this book as the most serious aspect of the fighting.  It is sad that Arabs are attacking Israeli civilians.  It is good that the media are positioned to report on this.  I think even vaguely honest reporting would bring enough political pressure to bear so that the attacks would stop.  That is why it is such a pity that we are seeing nothing of the sort.<br /><br />There are many other regions in the world where there is plenty of violence.  They don't have anything like the media coverage we see in the Levant.  If the media are failing so utterly in covering the Arab-Israeli conflict, one has to doubt their ability to get anything right.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.rious aspect of the fighting.

That includes Jews, Copts, Armenians, Kurds, Maronites, Assyrians, and Berbers.  He also asks about the status of those people who say they have been represented by Arafat.  Such people have been at the forefront of the fight against minority rights.  Are they really a minority as well?<br /><br />Next, Walid Phares gives a report on Middle Eastern Christians.  He includes the ones in southern Sudan.  It's similar in most places: the Christians are vanishing from the region.  And there is a systematic, general, and political abandonment of these Christians by the West.<br /><br />Bat Ye'or talks about the role of dhimmitude in the exodus of the Jews from Arab countries.  Dhimmis have no right to life, but must purchase it by humbly paying \\"protection money\\" to real people.  Bat Ye'or reminds us that dhimmis are not slaves.  They can and do earn money.  That enables them to pay taxes.  But they lack rights.  For example, they are not permitted to defend themselves from physical attack by Muslims or testify against Muslims in court.<br /><br />The fact that dhimmis are not slaves does suggest a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Israel, by paying sufficient protection money and humbly apologizing for existing, might be tolerated as a dhimmi nation.  And then again, it still might not be tolerated.<br /><br />Bat Ye'or reminds us that the Muslim world would be better off were it to denounce dhimmitude.  Otherwise, Muslim relations with other nations will be adversely affected, as will interactions of Muslims and non-Muslims in the West.<br /><br />Harold Troper tells about the campaign to rescue Syrian Jews, and the role of the Canadian Jewish community in achieving this.<br /><br />Ya'akov Meran talks about Arab reactions to the claims of expelled Jews.  One point he makes is that there have been multiple Arab requests for refugees from Israel to be paid back in land: that is, asking that Israel cede, say, a third of its land given that a third of the population in 1948 was expelled.  He reminds us that 35,000 Jews were expelled from Libya, which at the time had a total population of less than one person per square kilometer.  By Arab reasoning, Jews would be owed over 35,000 square kilometers from Libya alone (it gets more interesting when we add in nations such as Yemen or Iraq).  The entire West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Golan is about 5,000 square kilometers.<br /><br />Malka Hillel Shulewitz and Raphael Israeli argue for resettling the Arab refugees who are at present in refugee camps.  Given how quickly large numbers of refugees have been resettled in other population exchanges, there is no excuse to abide by Arab demands to keep the refugees in camps.  In addition, the camps are breeding grounds for terrorism.<br /><br />Avi Beker shows how UN and UNRWA obstructionism has made the Arab refugee situation much worse.  Yehuda Dominitz describes the absorption of 600,000 Jewish immigrants from Arab lands into Israel.  And Pnina Morag-Talmon explains how all these immigrants have been integrated into Israeli society.<br /><br />What are we to conclude from all this?

But what if you don't own a Border Collie or a Poodle or a German Shepherd?  What if you own a basenji, or a Whippet, or a Komondor, or a Greyhound?  How do you get started?  Matter of fact, how do you get the dog not to bite you?<br /><br />This book answers some of these questions, and tells about the way the author managed to train some of these less likely obedience candidates.  The goal generally was qualification in Utility Class, which typically takes several trials.  We see how Ms. Burnham managed to train several greyhounds and even a komondor (the photo of the komondor clearing the bar jump is one of the most unbelievable photographs of a dog I have ever seen).<br /><br />As a basenji owner, I found this book useful and enjoyable.	2004-12-26

And it has an enormous amount of interesting information that ought to intrigue even highly informed scientists.<br /><br />Harrison traces the history of cosmology and reviews some elementary astronomy.  Then we get to the question of a cosmological center and the Copernican Principle.  Next is a stimulating discussion of whether the universe has an edge or boundary in space or time.  After that, we're ready to read about curved space, relativity, and black holes (including \\"cosmic censorship,\\" Hawking radiation, and black hole thermodynamics, entropy, and information content).<br /><br />There is a wonderful chapter on the expansion of the universe, and an explanation of the Hubble sphere and its relation to the observable universe.<br /><br />After a description of several models of the universe, we get to some observational cosmology: use of redshifts and supernovae to establish distance scales, ages of the universe, galaxies, and stars, amount of helium produced by a hot big bang, and questions about \\"dark matter.\\"  Harrison then discusses what happened not in the \\"first three minutes,\\" but in the first second, including how inflationary theory can solve the horizon problem, the flatness problem, and the monopole problem.<br /><br />Near the end of the book, there is a fine explanation of why the sky is dark at night (resolving \\"Olbers' paradox\\").  The book concludes with a short discussion of life in the universe.<br /><br />This is an excellent and fascinating book.	2004-12-26

That's bad news for all sides in this dispute unless those of us who wish to resolve the conflict decide to value truth.<br /><br />Netanyahu starts by reminding us of Israel's size.  That's a major point.  Given the number of Jews, it is sobering to realize just how little sovereign land they have, and just how little value that land has.  It tells us quickly that if one side is being greedy in this conflict, it sure isn't Israel.  Netanyhau also reminds us that the land promised to the Jews as a national homeland (not necessarily a state, just land on which Jews would have permanent rights, including rights of immigration) was five times as parge as present-day Israel.  Again, exactly which side is being greedy?<br /><br />The author then traces the history of Zionism, refuting a well-known lie by Arafat that the Zionists stole a verdant land from its age-old native Arab inhabitants.  And he then gives a history of the British Mandate, which ended with the British openly supporting Arab opponents of Jewish rights.<br /><br />Now we get to the meat of the book, namely a refutation of some truly absurd and arbitrary lies that many readers will find tough to believe were ever seriously proposed.  The first is \\"the theory of Palestinian centrality.\\"  This is a claim that if one solves the problem of the Levantine Arabs, one can achieve peace in the Middle East!  Netanyahu establishes that many people really say this, and he refutes them.<br /><br />The next Big Lie is a \\"reversal of causality.\\"  It states that the problems of Levantine Arabs are a cause of the Arab attacks on Israel, not a result of them.  The author disposes of this lie as well.  Once again, the hard part is showing just how seriously some folks repeat this lie.<br /><br />Next, Netanyahu discusses the problem of the PLO, a terrorist group that claims to be the sole representative of Levantine Arabs.  He quite properly calls it a \\"Trojan horse.\\"  And he shows that establishing it as a state in the region is a counterproductive and immoral idea.<br /><br />The author then addresses the question of how peace can be achieved.  He says that for there to be peace, the Arab side must become convinced that aggression will have negative consequences.  If most Arabs become convinced of that, they may decide that Israel has a right to exist after all, and that human rights for Jews are not an affront and a casus belli.  From here, he argues that Israel needs some strategic depth, otherwise the temptation for Arabs to try to overwhelm it will be irresistable.<br /><br />Netanyahu then discusses \\"the demographic demon.\\"  He makes some good points here.  I think many people use demographics as a preposterous argument that runs something like this: Israel has a vast Empire of nearly 10,000 square miles.  Obviously, that is way too big for a mere 11 million Jews, only 5 million of whom live in Israel.  Yes, if nature takes its course, the tiny group of Jews will be overwhelmed in numbers by real people, who will outvote them.  The tiny group of Jewish oppressors will get what they deserve.  They will lose their vast Empire.  They ought to quit now, and give away all but a truly tiny amount of land, an amount they can afford!<br /><br />Of course, both 5 million and 11 million are large numbers, especially when compared to the number of Arabs per square mile of Arab land.  It is worth reading what Netanyahu has to say about the argument that Jews aren't numerous enough to have as big a nation as Israel!<br /><br />Netanyahu concludes that \\"peace must be built on foundations of security, justice, and above all, truth.\\"  He's right.  Truth has indeed, as he says, been the first casualty of the Arab war on Israel.  He points out that the problem is not territorial but existential.

Run away if you can.  If you can't get away (or simply refuse to do so), try to find allies.  No matter what you do, value truth: if you don't see things the way they really are, you will be even worse off.<br /><br />And Sennott does not really provide such advice.  He notes that Christians are leaving the area in droves.  But he fails to observe that it is generally the Muslims who are driving them away.  Nor does he see the extent to which a vicious cycle has developed in which the Christians who stay are precisely those who are willing to side more and more with the Muslims against the Jews.  And that such attitudes make the Jews less and less eager to help the Christians.  Meanwhile, Christian support for the Muslims does not reduce Muslim pressure on the Christians.<br /><br />The author's portrayal of Hanan Ashrawi is favorable, as though she is simply seeking peace and human rights for everyone.  In fact, this is far from the case.  Ashrawi has done nothing to support her fellow Christians and instead has supported the indoctrination of Arab youth that has helped produce the violence that is driving away Christians.<br /><br />Well, perhaps Sennott has an idea about how to achieve peace in the region.  Surely, that would help everyone!  How about a little truth and reconciliation?  That has helped in other conflicts.  But Sennott dismisses this on the grounds that there are no clear villians or victims.  To put it mildly, I disagree.  We've seen Jews oscillate between defending themselves and showing \\"restraint\\" when pressured by the international community.  But an Israel at peace would hardly take on the entire Arab world, let alone the rest of the world as well, just for fun.  It's obvious that if the Arabs stop attacking the Jews, there will be peace, whether the Jews all like it or not.  And that ought to get us to see who the villains are and who the victims are.<br /><br />There is a little test for Sennott in his introduction, where he describes the takeover of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem by Muslim terrorists.  This would have been a good opportunity for the Vatican to unequivocally condemn the misuse of Church property and regard the Christians in the church as hostages (and demand their release).  But instead, the Vatican's focus was on condemning Israel.  That meant one of two things: either the Vatican was abandoning its coreligionists, or it was indicating that the Christians at the church were willing accomplices of the terrorists.  This was the right time for Sennott to take an unequivocal stand in favor of human rights and against terror.  But he didn't.  Not even against anti-Christian terror.<br /><br />I don't know if Sennott's approach will get Western Christians to sympathize more with their Arab coreligionists.  But it certainly didn't make a very positive impression on me.are no clear villians or victims.   To put it mildly, I disagree.

Hertzberg, a very knowledgeable person, thinks that although a genuine peace between Arabs and Israelis is not possible, we ought to have an imposed peace.  A peace imposed by the United States!  No, not a peace.  A ceasefire, in which we'd stop Israel from its \\"creeping annexation\\" of the West Bank!  And use our troops to enforce it, rather than try to use any diplomatic options that might avoid committing American soldiers in such a manner.<br /><br />In my opinion, taking Hertzberg's advice literally is not a good idea here.  Having the US enforce a cease-fire would risk getting our soldiers attacked by the Arabs, no matter where the lines were drawn.  I think American policy in Iraq in 2004 would look positively brilliant by comparison.<br /><br />Still, this book is worth four stars.  Let me tell you some of the good points the author does make:<br /><br />1)  Israel is basically secular, not dominated by religious leaders as many of its detractors imply.<br /><br />2)  Zionism is not colonialism, nor is it racism.<br /><br />3)  Many Western \\"liberals\\" act as if Israel's existence were \\"the worst outrage that exists today in the world,\\" when in fact it is not even the biggest issue in the Arab world.<br /><br />4)  The antizionism of the British newspaper, the Guardian, and the French newspaper, Le Monde, is simply \\"disgusting.\\"<br /><br />5)  Israel is not simply a US colony, unable to stand up by itself.<br /><br />6)  Those Westerners who demand the destruction of Israel will gain nothing from it.  Certainly, they will not achieve peace, even if they succeed in destroying Israel.<br /><br />7)  Many attacks on Israel are really proxy attacks on the United States.  Noam Chomsky's attacks on the United States are particularly \\"intolerable.\\"  By the way, Hertzberg does us a service by tracing a little of the history of Chomsky's views about Israel.<br /><br />8)  A partition of the former British Mandate of 1946 will not work.  A \\"two-state solution,\\" something Hertzberg has advocated for the past 35 years, will not work.  This is an amazing concession to reality by Hertzberg, and I am impressed that he would not merely realize it but admit it.<br /><br />I actually recommend this book.8)  A partition of the former British Mandate of 1946 will not work.

413943:US	53071109	R2C9RXA959OI5E	0742517527	693492215	The Other Side of Despair: Jews and Arabs in the Promised Land	Books	1	1	1	N	N	Looking for a solution to the wrong problem	Gavron is to be commended for trying to find a solution to the long conflict between Arabs and Jews over Israel.  And he has some good points to make.  But I still think he fails to come up with any ideas that will prove useful as they stand.<br /><br />The author starts by saying that there are four ways to resolve the conflict.  One is to expel the Jews from the area.  Two is to expel the Arabs.  Three is to divide the area into two states, one for each side.  Four is to have a single-state solution.<br /><br />Gavron dismisses the first two solutions.  I agree with him on that.  Not only do I think these would be immoral and unjust, I think they would fail to achieve peace.<br /><br />The next issue is the \\"two-state\\" solution.  That might make sense if a few things were true.  If there really were two nations that needed states there to defend their people and their rights, and if both of these nations really wanted a state, then I think we'd try to figure out how much land each side had, how much land each side could propose to purchase, and so forth.  That is, we could try to accomodate each of them. If they were willing to keep their side of a bargain, they could get what they needed.<br /><br />Gavron sees part of the problem here.  Right now, neither side wants any part of a two-state solution.  Israel wants one only if it can thereby have peace.  The Arabs want one only if they can keep fighting Israel.  And he concludes that the only way a two-state solution will work is if it is totally unnecessary.<br /><br />That is a very useful point.  And the author then states that we do not really need a border between two states, so a one-state solution is the right answer.<br /><br />Still, Gavron says that we also need to get rid of the Israeli Law of Return.  In exchange, the Arabs could drop the demand to give millions of Arabs a right to move into Israel.<br /><br />I think this latter idea misses the point, and it is a serious error.  In fact, many Zionists in the period between World War One and World War Two did not demand a Jewish state.  All this changed when Jewish immigration to Israel was curtailed by the 1939 White Paper.  At that point, it became clear that to protect human rights, Jews needed a state.  That is why Israel exists today.  A solution to the present conflict that curtails immigration takes us back to the pre-state problem.<br /><br />Moreover, the problem is an Arab problem as well.  Arabs are going to need to live in peace with their neighbors.  And that means that one day, they will need to demand rights for both themselves and their neighbors, rather than for neither.  Unless they do that, they'll wind up in wars with all their neighbors, not merely in a war with the Jews.<br /><br />All sorts of peoples have states.  The French do.  The Germans do.  I see no reason to deny the Hebrews a state.  But let's suppose that for some reason, our species needed to deny statehood to the Jews and only to the Jews.  Well, in that case, I think as a minimum, we'd need to make such a state unnecessary by making sure that Jews would have rights to life, liberty, and property in the region.  And a right to immigrate into it.  That's why I think Gavron's idea is so bad.  By asking to get rid of the Law of Return, he's showing us that we really need to find a solution in which the Jews themselves have control over Jewish immigration.<br /><br />What we need is a serious discussion of a proposal that would permit all this.  After all, there are over five million Jews in Israel.  They live on less than ten thousand square miles of land.  If one wants peace, why not simply make peace with them?  Why not let them live on this rather small amount of land and enjoy human rights there?  It's unlikely that the Jews would refuse such an offer!  More important, peace would benefit the Arabs as well.

And it sure would be nice to live together on it in peace.  But unless one is prepared to fight against the establishment of a worldwide tyranny, simply agreeing to live in peace will probably produce misery.  We've seen plenty of evidence that refusal to fight does not prevent aggression and wars.<br /><br />And it seems to me that standing up to tyrants is something the author is not willing to do.  He wants the Christian world, especially the European Christians, to ally themselves with the Muslims on Muslim terms.  He thinks we all ought to focus on what we can learn from Muslim values.  And he says that \\"blood is thicker than holy water.\\"<br /><br />Well, I'm a little suspicious of how all this will turn out.  I can only imagine what, say, Bat Ye'or might write about it (probably that European Christians will wind up being treated as dhimmis by the Muslims if we take Bulliet's advice).<br /><br />I'm also suspicious of a proposal for an alliance that argues against the writings of both Bernard Lewis and Samuel Huntington.  The reason is that both of these gentlemen have noticed some disturbing increases in Muslim violence against the West.  If the alliance is to be with the more violent Muslim leaders, whom is this alliance going to attack?  The Pagans and Jews?  Not that it matters.  All sides need to be discouraging self-righteous aggression, not allying themselves with it.<br /><br />Some folks pretend that non-Muslims have two choices.  Either choose pointless aggression and destructive warfare against the Muslims, or agree to cooperate with the Muslims on the terms of their most visible (and probably most violent) leaders.  I think that's nonsense, and that either of these choices would lead to disaster.  Instead, I think we need to take a stand in favor of human rights and stick to it.<br /><br />I think Bulliet ought to have drawn a clear line and demanded that everyone must have human rights.  And that everyone needs to demand human rights both for themselves and for everyone else.  And if there are to be international rules, they need to be secular and fair to everyone, regardless of race, religion, color, or creed.  But I didn't see him do that.yone needs to demand human rights both for themselves and for everyone else.

The author is a former correspondent for the Wall Street Journal.  And he's advancing a thesis that the Arab world is headed the wrong way economically.  I tend to agree with that.  After all, except for sales of natural resources, the Arab world is not particularly competitive.  That's not a good sign.  And while some people disliked Glain's anecdotal treatment of the region, I think it actually worked fairly well to highlight some of the problems.<br /><br />Glain implies that a major Arab economic collapse wouldn't be good for anyone, and I certainly agree with that.  Glain paints a pessimistic picture, and I basically agree with that as well.<br /><br />Okay, why didn't I give it five stars?  I seem to agree with its facts, its presentation, its conclusions, and, surely, with its politics.<br /><br />But the truth is that I find fault with all of the above.<br /><br />Had I been writing such a book and come to the section on Israel, I know what I would have said.  I would have explained that Israel is a prime example of Arab failures to deal with truth and reality.  And that it is also a prime example of present Arab opposition to justice and human rights.  I would have connected all this to Arab economic and societal problems.<br /><br />I would have talked about Camp David, and I would have shown how greedy and unjust Arafat's demands were (while admitting that neither side actually was offered anything of genuine value to it: Arafat was not offered Israel's head on a platter, and the Israelis were not offered peace).  I would have made the point that Glain made, namely that Robert Malley and his boss, Dennis Ross came up with quite different views about the facts of what happened at Camp David.  But I would have drawn the obvious conclusion from that!  Namely, if you drag folks into negotiations with thugs, only to offer them nothing and then tell all sorts of lies about them, eventually people will refuse to negotiate with thugs no matter how much you want them to.<br /><br />Instead, Glain seemed to imply that in a just world, Israel can't really maintain a huge 8000 to 10,000 square mile Empire.  And that is pure nonsense.  Worse, acceptance of such obvious absurdities is at the core of the failure of the Arab world to value truth, justice, human rights, and prosperity.much you want them to. <br /> <br />Instead, Glain seemed to imply that in a just world, Israel can't really maintain a huge 8000 to 10,000 square mile Empire.

It begins with some introductory material about microscopic and macroscopic laws of physics.  After that, we learn about stars and their evolution.  And binary stars.  Next are galaxies and galactic clusters.  And cosmology and the hot big bang.  Then our planetary system.  And we finish with life and intelligence in the universe.<br /><br />I read this book when it first came out and truly enjoyed it.  But I do want to warn folks that it is getting a little out-of-date and definitely needs a new edition.  In the past twenty years, we have made plenty of new discoveries.  Topics such as dark energy, the accelerating expansion of the universe, cosmic microwave background anisotropies, gamma-ray bursters and soft gamma repeaters, supernova 1987A, ultraluminous infrared galaxies, extrasolar planets and planetary migration, the Big Splat theory of the origin of the Moon, and inflationary models of the big bang are too new to be in this book.  Plenty of work on formation of galaxies is too new as well.  Descriptions of and recent results from deep space probes and telescopes are not included.  That leaves us with much less to discuss about Uranus or Neptune, not to mention recent in situ observations of Mars or questions about water under the icy surface of Europa.  And even topics such as artificial intelligence are discussed without the benefit of the past twenty years of perspective.<br /><br />I still recommend the book.  But I wouldn't be able to teach a class on astronomy or astrophysics from this text without supplementing it with a substantial amount of extra material.	2004-12-23

And there's plenty of good material in the book.  Still, I wish it had delved into some of the topics in greater detail.  And while I tend to try to be as comprehensive as possible when I cover a field, I have to admit that Tajmar covers some topics I would actually have skipped.<br /><br />The book starts with a quick overview of rocket propulsion, including monopropellant and bipropellant engines.  And we soon discover that Tajmar is going to take us from the fundamentals of rocket science into more speculative areas.  He briefly discusses \\"advanced propellants\\" such as atomic hydrogen, metastable helium, and metallic hydrogen.  Let's just say that in spite of (or maybe due to) my familiarity with these ideas, it would not have occurred to me to mention them in a book.<br /><br />The author then evaluates launch assist technologies.  These include aircraft assists, catapults, cannons, gas guns, ram accelerators, and electromagnetic (and magnetohydrodynamic) accelerators.  There's even a mention of reducing drag with surface charging.<br /><br />Next we get to nuclear propulsion.  I would have expanded the section on fission propulsion, and thought twice about including the material on fusion propulsion and antimatter propulsion.<br /><br />I think the best part of the book is the chapter on electric propulsion systems.  There's plenty of information, including excellent photographs, of resistojets, arcjets, Hall thrusters, Kaufmann thrusters, Field Emission thrusters, Colloid thrusters, and more.  Plus, there is a short section that could have been expanded on the threat of induced interactions between the plasma emitted by the propulsion system and the spacecraft.<br /><br />Since this book looks to the future, that means a discussion of propulsion systems applicable for use on microspacecraft.  Tajmar therefore includes a chapter on micropropulsion.<br /><br />The next section is very interesting and not wholly speculative: \\"propellantless propulsion.\\"  That means tethers, laser propulsion, solar sails, and magnetic sails.  Of these, I think solar sails surely deserved at least a few more pages.<br /><br />The final chapter is a leap into what I think of as science fiction.  That includes what I call \\"quantum propulsion\\" (an attempt to modify the vacuum and use the energy generated to propel a spacecraft).  And it includes a attempts to couple gravitation and electromagnetism.  And my, um, favorite: superconductor gravitational shielding.

And while some folks may call them \\"self-hating Jews,\\" I sure don't.  These people think very highly of themselves and, for that matter, of each other.  Nevertheless, I do not think highly of most of them, and it is worth pointing out why.<br /><br />Some of the earlier articles are historical.  It is revealing to compare Ahad Ha'am, Judah Magnes, and Martin Buber with the more recent contributors.  Ha'am found plenty of fault with Herzl, but never supported terror by either side.  Magnes also demanded Jewish rights.  And Buber was willing to defend Jewish rights in the Levant, and he did so in a famous letter in 1939 to Mahatma Gandhi.  It was Gandhi who denied the Jews any rights there.<br /><br />The problem is that many of the more modern contributors have been cajoled or otherwise convinced to support fascist thugs.<br /><br />The politics of the authors is really up to them.  I don't happen to agree with them politically, but there is a little more to it than that.  For one thing, it isn't merely a political issue.  We're also seeing some rather serious misrepresentations of Israel and Zionism by many authors.  And second, I feel that on top of that, the authors are falsely pretending to have a genuine commitment to liberalism when they are actually defending reactionary terrorism.  A final problem is that the editors failed to include any articles to counter this steady barrage of misleading essays.<br /><br />I turn slightly green when I see praise of ISM members such as Rachel Corrie in this book.  And that's only one of a few dozen examples of the attacks on human rights, justice, and truth I was deluged by in this volume.<br /><br />Normally, I would point out that opposition to truth, justice, and human rights will eventually discredit one's cause.  One example in particular is the discrediting of German Paganism following World War Two.  But upon reflection, I think this is a poor analogy.  I think most of the authors have no cause.  They certainly do not espouse liberalism or human rights.  And that's part of the reason I think so poorly of them.<br /><br />I have a very poor opinion of the Icelanders who surrendered to the Christians without a real fight a thousand years ago.  These Vikings were experts at fighting who lay down their swords.  And experts at writing who lay down their pens.  The authors of this book are behaving the same way.  They ought to have picked up their pens to stand up for truth, justice, and human rights.  Instead, they wrote to support those who attack truth, justice, and human rights.<br /><br />Avoid this book.  Go watch a movie instead.

Gilbert uses his sources primarily to obtain facts, not opinions.<br /><br />The book begins with the start of modern Zionism, with the first settlements starting in 1878.  But we quickly get through World War One and into the British Mandate period.<br /><br />Although Gilbert is British, he does not hesitate to describe the infamous British White Paper of 1939, which caused a Jewish revolt that led to the establishment of Israel.  Nor does he avoid discussing the ships that tried to run the British blockade in World War Two.  And he admits that after the war, in spite of Labour Party promises to make the Mandate a Jewish state, the Labour government instead did the opposite, and became obsessed with the idea of preventing Jews from getting into the Levant.<br /><br />There is a very good description of the Arab-Israeli war of 1948.  And a thorough history of Israel from then on.  We see Israel grow as a nation.  We see wars in which Israeli succeeds on the battlefield only to lose diplomatically.  And Gilbert shows exactly what these diplomatic losses mean.  They do not mean merely the loss of a few homes or land or money.  They mean more war.  Each diplomatic loss hurts because it gets the Arabs to attack them once again.  And we see how Israeli self-restraint coupled with international demands on Israel for even more restraint generally wind up causing more violence, not less.  Gilbert is to be congratulated for showing how this has occurred.<br /><br />The only weak points of the book are the most recent four years.  These deal with the Oslo \\"peace process.\\"  Gilbert, of course, wrote the book before he knew how events would pan out.  And he wound up guessing wrong.  That caused him to lack perspective on the significance of Arab insincerity at Oslo, or the significance of the assassination of Rabin.  For example, when Israel opened a door to a tunnel in the Muslim quarter of the Old City in 1996, Gilbert quite properly puts the actual act in perspective.  All it did was improve things for tourists, giving Muslim shopkeepers a benefit.  But there were Arab riots.  Here, Gilbert, with the perspective we have years later, probably would have seen these riots as provoked only by Arabs.  But in this book, he's too close to the situation, and looks for Israeli errors.<br /><br />This book has few obvious errors.  Given how awful some of the more biased histories of Israel can be, this one is a very good place to start.That caused him to lack perspective on the significance of Arab insincerity at Oslo, or the significance of the assassination of Rabin.

This book is actually in the form of a long essay defending the hypothesis that life, at least in microbial form, is widespread in the Galaxy.<br /><br />The author starts by trying to define life.  Is it replication?  Evolution?  Metabolism?  Next, he discusses the question of the atmosphere of the early Earth.  A reducing atmosphere might produce complex organic molecules in some warm little pond.  But the Earth is unlikely to have had such an atmosphere then.  That leads to the question of where life originated.  Near ocean vents, or on (or just under) the ocean floor?  And when life originated.  Over 4 billion years ago?  When the Earth was still being bombarded by bolides?<br /><br />The author then discusses meteorites, along with the possibilities for them having brought organic molecules (or even life) to Earth.  After that, there's some material on extrasolar planets, including \\"hot Jupiters,\\" which may migrate right through a stellar system, wiping out all the rest of the planets in it.<br /><br />A very interesting section is Darling's critique of Ward and Brownlee's book, \\"Rare Earth.\\"  That book contains the view that although microbial life is probably widespread on other worlds, multicellular life (and especially intelligent life) will prove to be rare.  Actually, that view, while a minority one, is unremarkable.  After all, there is good evidence that unicellular life originated rather quickly on Earth while multicellular life took quite a bit longer.  But Ward and Brownlee go further than that, claiming that several things about Earth are special and unusual: the Moon, the exact spacing between catastrophic events, being in the right part of the \\"habitable zone,\\" having Jupiter to shield it from heavier bolide bombardment, having a high metallicity Sun, having plate tectonics, and being in the right part of the Galaxy!  Darling presents interesting rebuttals to these points.  And he finishes the chapter by pointing out that a collaborator of Ward and Brownlee, Guillermo Gonzalez, keeps finding signs that the Earth is unique.  Darling asks if Gonzalez is letting his religious beliefs influence his scientific views (Gonzalez says that his views that life's origin involved the personal involvement of a supernatural creator have motivated his science and vice-versa).  Um, that is a good question.  Still, I wonder if that's altogether fair.  Ought we ask about Simon Conway Morris, whose religious beliefs support his views on convergence?  Or about, say, Fred Hoyle, with his views on panspermia?  Or about Freeman Dyson, whose scientific ideas seem rather independent of his religious views?  Or about, um, me?<br /><br />In any case, Darling continues with the debate between Stephen Jay Gould and Simon Conway Morris.  Gould argues for divergionism, and says that were we to \\"replay the tape of life,\\" the odds are that the chordate worm that first incorporated what became the human body plan would have been lost and there would have been no humans.  Conway Morris argues for convergionism, and says that no matter what specific species survive, niches tend to get filled.  And that means that some creatures very much like humans would have evolved had we replayed that tape.  Darling agrees, and adds that even intelligence appears to be convergent.<br /><br />The author then tells about upcoming space missions to look for life in the solar system and to discover more about extrasolar planets.<br /><br />Darling concludes that life is a universal phenomenon, life's most important characteristic is to engage in Darwinian evolution, life originates on planets and moons, planets are very common, the evolution of life involves contingency and convergence, and life can be both planet-wide and refugial.  But he says that future events may get us to change our minds on some of this.  What if we find life on Mars?  Or find definitive evidence that Mars has always been sterile?  Or find life (or even find complex life) on Europa?  What if we spot an atmosphere on an extrasolar planet that suggests life abounds there?  What if we find  bacteria in interstellar space?  What if we find life based on silicon instead of carbon?  Or make contact with extraterrestrial artificial life?  And while it might be tough to verify it, what if we were to discover that there is no other intelligent life (or no other life) in the universe?<br /><br />While it wouldn't surprise too many people, the author says it would also be significant were we to verify the existence of a very deep, hot biosphere such as the one Thomas Gold has proposed.<br /><br />This book is easy to read and informative.

I wish it were, so that I could offer an attractive class with a course description something like:<br /><br />... Experimental Universe Construction (Astrobiology 404).  We'll start by discovering how our Universe was created and use this information to build and use a machine that produces universes.  After several trials lasting only a few billion years each during which we'll learn the ropes about being uniquely powerful, we'll decide which laws of nature and life-forms we like best and generate universes we'll enjoy far more than this one.  And we'll just go on having fun forever. ...<br /><br />Unfortunately, the closest I can come to this is (sigh) simply a class about the origins of life and the universe.  And this short book is a very readable and informative introduction to the subject.<br /><br />The book starts with a discussion of science and a characterization of life.  Then there is an explanation of the differences between Newtonian physics, in which there are no limits on speeds, and Einsteinian physics, where nothing (not even gravity) can move faster than the speed of light.  And we get an introduction to quantum mechanics and particle physics.  After that is a short but clear summary of our present ideas of how elements were formed in the Big Bang and gave rise to galaxies with stars and planets.<br /><br />Next, there is a description of DNA as it exists today.  From there, we discuss metabolism and the role of ATP.  That includes a mention of anaerobic metabolism, which is connected to the time when life existed on an Earth that lacked oxygen in its atmosphere.  And Lurquin explains that simple forms of life can subsist on a diet of sunlight and minerals alone.  Once life got started, it certainly had food!<br /><br />Following this is a very interesting chapter about how the first informational organic molecules may have arisen.  That includes information about organic molecules in interstellar clouds and meteorites as well as about synthesis of organics in the Earth's atmosphere and on the ocean floor.  The author discusses the two main theories about how life originated: proteins first, in an iron-and-sulfide world, or RNA first, with the RNA producing the proteins.  Lurquin mentions that the correct answer could be a little of each of these.<br /><br />I liked the next chapter best of all, a discussion of how life might have proceeded from an RNA world to a DNA world and how the progression from proto-cells to eukaryotes may have taken place.  The author then addresses the question of whether life exists (or has existed) elsewhere and whether life on Earth could have actually been brought here originally from, say, Mars.  There are some concluding speculations about how long humans on Earth may last before we destroy ourselves in wars.<br /><br />This is a well-written book and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the subject.anic molecules in interstellar clouds and meteorites as well as about synthesis of organics in the Earth's atmosphere and on the ocean floor.

417043:US	53071109	R2CXU0VUMWMGSU	038700436X	619900474	Centauri Dreams: Imagining and Planning Interstellar Exploration	Books	5	13	16	N	N	The meek inherit the Earth, the rest of us go to the stars	This book is about sending a space mission to a nearby star.  I know, it sounds more like science fiction than fact.  We're talking about really long missions.  Perhaps several hundred years or even a couple of thousand years.  Even the one-way light time to our objective would be on the order of five or ten light years.<br /><br />Gilster starts by mentioning some possible destinations: Alpha Centauri (closest, at 4.3 light years) and Epsilon Eridani (10.7 light years but may be more interesting biologically).  Or possibly Barnard's star (5.9 light years) or even Tau Ceti (11.9 light years).<br /><br />Yes, we could try to get a spacecraft to move much faster.  But that's not easy.  And there's a much, much higher chance for the spacecraft to be destroyed just by hitting a very small object.  The author warns us that at such speeds, a grain of sand would look like a torpedo.  Even if one of the speculative propulsion technologies the author then discusses could be made to work, the chance of the spacecraft surviving the trip might be rather small.<br /><br />On the other hand, the author also tells us about space telescopes that will be looking for terrestrial planets in the next few years.  What if one of them finds a planet that looks like it harbors life?  Would we then start taking a mission to that planet seriously?<br /><br />Still, how does one get there?  Gilster explains that chemical rockets are unlikely to be the right answer.  Even nuclear propulsion is too weak.  The first alternative he suggests is antimatter.  With all due respect, I find this idea preposterous.  The next idea is a Laser Accelerated Plasma Propulsion System (LAPPS).  While this idea might work in theory, present technology is several orders of magnitude short of being usable.<br /><br />Next we get a technology that come a little closer: solar sails.  The author discusses a 249 x 249 foot sail that is being built by L'Garde, a California corporation, that can take a 3-kilogram payload out of the solar system.  It would take this sail 100,000 years to get to Alpha Centauri, which shows that with today's technology, we are about two orders of magnitude short of what we need for such a mission to make any sense.  The author explains that with expected improvements in technology, we're likely to get one of those factor-of-ten improvements.  But the next one will not be so easy.  Nevertheless, this is the least speculative of the ideas presented in the book.<br /><br />Gilster also tells of another (but more speculative) idea that might give us a similar speed, namely Mini-Magnetospheric Plasma Propulsion (M2P2), which is advocated by Robert Winglee at the University of Washington.  This involves creating a \\"magnetic sail\\" kilometers in diameter which would hitch a ride on the solar wind.  This idea needs much more work than a normal solar sail, but I think it is worth pursuing.<br /><br />After this, we see a technology that would supply enough speed to our spacecraft if it worked: a laser-beam driven sail.  All we need is 65 trillion watts of power on the ground!  Plus the technology to deliver it to the spacecraft sail.  And then get the craft to survive the flight.  I guess all this is worth investigating, but this technology is nowhere near where it needs to be so far.  At best it seems impossibly expensive.<br /><br />The final portion of the book deals with some obvious problems: how do we communicate with the spacecraft when it is so far away?  How will spacecraft navigation work?  Or power?  And best of all, how will the spacecraft maintain itself?  What sorts of AI algorithms will need to be developed?<br /><br />I found this book very interesting, but it does appear that it will be a long while before we have a successful mission to another star.-kilogram payload out of the solar system.

It describes Middle East history for the first half of the twentieth century.  And it has an open, irreverent style that many people seem to like.  Hey, that's my style too.  But now that I got a big taste of my own medicine, I found I didn't always enjoy it.<br /><br />Let me try to explain the problem.  There is too much \\"realpolitik.\\"  And sometimes, it obscures the big picture.<br /><br />Suppose I were trying to describe the emancipation of the Blacks in the American South after the Civil War.  If I were into realpolitik and irreverence, I might explain how political pressure enabled the Blacks to achieve emancipation.  And, of course, I would imply that emancipation was not really wrong, given that Blacks had the power to achieve it!  But I might also explain that it was totally unfair to the Whites to allow the Blacks to be liberated from slavery!<br /><br />Well, if I did that, it would be racist of me.  And it would also be dishonest.  You see, enslaving the Blacks was always an arbitrary idea.  It was bad for pretty much everyone.  A good test is that \\"color-blind\\" folks would never have thought of such an immoral idea.<br /><br />I think Keay makes a similar mistake when he discusses the Zionists.  He has no problem allowing them their State.  But only by might, not by right.  And in doing so, he totally overlooks the fact that in a color-blind world, the Jews would have simply bought far more land than they wound up with in real life.  Meanwhile, Keay offers some misplaced sympathy to the Arabs who had to witness the Jews become emancipated, and who wound up selling land to those Jews at quite high prices, and wound up watching the Jews improve the economy and living standards for everyone in the region.<br /><br />This book offers quite a bit of history and some valuable insights, and it is fun to read.  But it occasionally lacks some needed perspective.	2004-12-19

But rather than place them a century ago or more, they are placed far away from many of us in space ... in the Levant.  In the wild, wild, West Bank.<br /><br />I think a key point is that the reader can empathize with the characters.  After all, if some law enforcement personnel were to \\"clean up\\" their little neck of the woods, the characters we see would fare well.  These are hardworking people who both dislike violence and are hurt by violence.  And it makes for an interesting story.<br /><br />Miller's descriptive powers are excellent.  And while it might have been an even better novel had there been some thrilling overall plot line, I thought the book was fine the way it was.	2004-12-19

About 24,000 Ainu still live on Hokkaido.  And we then see our first of the interesting wildlife species of the book, the fishowl.

And that means counting to 13, over and over and over again.  And it helps.  If you are indeed a good defender, this will help make you a very good defender.<br /><br />The 15 pages on opening leads helped me more than the rest of the book combined.  Right after reading the chapter, I played in a bridge tournament.  Declarer had bid both majors and dummy had picked hearts, a suit I held A-x in.  I immediately led the low heart, stopping declarer from ruffing spades while maintaining control, and setting the contract.  It was almost exactly the hand Kelsey had shown on page 61!<br /><br />That's the good thing about this book.  There's plenty of examples that are very similar to what you'll find in actual play.

And about the spectrum, and related temperatures.  And all sorts of wonderful things about telescopes.  There's a really nice description of our planetary system.  We get to learn some fundamental properties of stars, and you are taught about the main sequence and H-R diagrams.  We read about star formation: protostars, accretion disks, and Herbig-Haro objects.  And about extrasolar planets.<br /><br />Next we learn about star death.  That means looking at planetary nebulae, supernovae, and cataclysmic variable stars.  And there's a discussion of Gamma-ray bursters.<br /><br />Then we look at galaxies.  We find out how galaxies are categorized and learn about galactic evolution and mergers and star formation rates.  And about active galaxies, quasars, and black holes.<br /><br />After that, there is a chapter on cosmology.  We find out about dark matter and dark energy.  And how the expansion of our universe is accelerating.<br /><br />The final chapter is about future space missions and telescopes.  That includes missions to Mars, a comet impact in 2005, and space telescopes that may find some more extrasolar planets.  In addition we read about a proposal for a 100-meter ground-based scope, the OWL (OverWhelmingly Large Telescope).  As well as the Low-Frequency Array, a set of thousands of antennas that might not be built in the Netherlands, as the array may be larger than that nation.<br /><br />I think it may be worth getting this book for the pictures alone.

Rather than gloss over differences of opinion about the country, it selects articles with well-defined viewpoints.<br /><br />We start with an excerpt from \\"The Jewish State\\" by Herzl showing that a Jewish state is necessary to normalize the Jewish people, given that the Jews will not \\"be left in peace.\\"  That's countered by Ahad Ha-am, who argues that Jews ought to be special and refuse a state!  And there is a juicy and vicious tidbit against Zionism from Mahatma Gandhi, a person I previously had a high regard for.<br /><br />Then we see an article by David Ben-Gurion in favor of Zionism and a counterclaim by George Antonius that there is no room in the Levant for any more nations!  Plus a fascinating article by Judah Magnes, who is willing to give up on having a Jewish state if there guaranteed Jewish immigration, settlement on the land, Hebrew life, and culture.  I think it is interesting that he did not demand freedom.  But it hasn't mattered, Jews have had no chance to get any of what Magnes did demand without a state.<br /><br />There is an outrageous article by Ed Said and others that seems intent on setting a world record for falsehoods per word.  And a good article by Peter Schwartz on how the Jews and Arabs value civil rights.  There are articles about Israel's value (or lack of it) to the United States.  And once you start wondering if Israel is just an American colony, there is an article by Cheryl Rubenberg who implies that America is an Israeli colony!  Plus a sober essay by Hyman Bookbinder, who reminds us that the Jewish lobby is not nearly as strong as its enemies assert, but not nearly as weak as they would like it to be.<br /><br />The presence of opposing views breaks the spell of some of the more absurd articles.  For example, Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi might seem to be reasonable if he had the floor to himself when saying that the UN condemned Zionism as racism in 1975.  But in this book, his failure to condemn such a lie is properly seen as extreme and ludicrous.<br /><br />Yitzhak Shamir comes across well, given that he speaks sincerely in favor of fulfilling the dream of Herzl.  Kathleen Christison does not, as she tries to advise the Jews to give Arafat what he wants, in effect surrendering now, before it is too late.  And there are interesting articles about whether Israel ought to keep all, none or part of the West Bank.<br /><br />There are also articles debating whether or not Israel should become more religious, less religious, or pluralistic.  And we see arguments about the importance of rebuilding the Jewish Temple, and about Divine Purpose.<br /><br />This is simply a superb book.  As the editors claim, one can't understand one's own arguments unless one understands the arguments of those who disagree.  But one can't understand the arguments of those who disagree unless one sees them challenged.demn such a lie is properly seen as extreme and ludicrous.<br /><br />Yitzhak Shamir comes across well, given that he speaks sincerely in favor of fulfilling the dream of Herzl.

In this book, Bat Ye'or gives a surprisingly simple answer.  I think she's absolutely nailed the cause of the problem:<br /><br />\\"It is well known that the successful revolt of the colonized frequently traumatizes the colonizer.  Vengefulness and hatred express the distress of the oppressor confronted by his victim's rebellion.  An equality of rights with the inferior party humiliates the dominating group which, deprived of its superiority, seeks compensation in phantasms.  Such reactions have been exhaustively analyzed in books dealing with the phenomenon of racism.\\"<br /><br />The author shows these attitudes in action, as various Arabs complain that the presence of Jews in Israel defiles the land, or that the land is all Arab, with Jews being mere \\"dhimmis.\\"  The liberation of the Jews is sometimes considered a crime against Nature, as we see Egyptian President Nasser call it \\"the greatest international crime that has been committed in the entire history of mankind.\\"<br /><br />The terms applied by Arab racists to Jewish dhimmis who sought freedom are now applied to Israel itself: insolent, arrogant, and needing punishment.<br /><br />I think this book is one of the best at explaining why Arabs and Jews are at odds in the Middle East.  And why they'll continue to be at odds until Arabs renounce such racism and until international applause for this racism quiets down.<br /><br />Bat Ye'or explains the problems of being a dhimmi.  A dhimmi lacks rights and is thus dependent on the good will of, um, real people.  A dhimmi has no history; actually a dhimmi has no right to have a history, and real people write any history they please regarding dhimmis.  And the author shows that although Zionism is more an Oriental phenomenon than a European one, the refusal to acknowledge Zionist history tends to lead to claims that Zionism is exclusively a European movement.  In addition, she implies that the refusal of many Arabs to refer to Israel or to allow it to be on Arab maps is another symptom of the tendency to refuse dhimmis the right to a historical existence.<br /><br />The author contrasts the outrage of many antizionist Arabs with the relative silence of some genuine victims: Jews who were expelled from Arab nations.  She attributes some of this to a tendency of dhimmis, with their history of having been exploited, servile, and silent, to think in terms of gratitude and toleration rather than in terms of rights.<br /><br />In this book, Bat Ye'or does a superb job of explaining the dhimmi condition.  And I think we all ought to heed her warning that those who forget history are indeed condemned to repeat it.nother symptom of the tendency to refuse dhimmis the right to a historical existence.

Of how the less than 150 inhabitants of Yad Mordechai held off a brigade-size (2000 soldiers) Egyptian force for nearly six days starting on May 19, 1948, and showed that freedom can be possible if one is willing to fight for it.  110 of the defenders escaped in a daring May 24 retreat, while 26 died in the battle.  There were roughly 300 Egyptian casualties.<br /><br />Margaret Larkin does a splendid job of giving us the history of this kibbutz prior to the War of 1948.  And she gives an overview of the military situation at the start of the Arab invasion.  There are two dozen photographs about Yad Mordechai and the battle.<br /><br />Yad Mordechai was named for Mordechai Analevicz, the twenty-two old leader of the Warsaw Ghetto Jewish uprising against the Germans in 1943.<br /><br />Israel made good use of the six days that the defenders of Yad Mordechai provided to set up defenses against the Egyptian army, which was headed north, towards Tel Aviv.<br /><br />The defenders of Yad Mordechai had some weapons, of course.  400 hand grenades.  Two 2-inch mortars with 50 shells.  An anti-tank gun with three shells.  A machine gun with 10,000 rounds of ammunition, and five sub machine guns with several dozen rounds of ammunition for each.  And more than three dozen rifles, with about 3000 rounds of ammunition in total.  Still, I got the strong impression that most military people would have expected a kibbutz with these prospects for defence to be captured in at most a few hours, not six days.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to learn about the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 ought to read this book, with its detailed descriptions of this amazing battle and of the people who fought it.	2004-12-18

And we discover how difficult it was for even Jeane Kirkpatrick to counter some of it.  However, I think the main issue of the book is not Kirkpatrick, but the UN.<br /><br />I thought it was strange how difficult it was for our administration to counter requests to bring Arab terrorists into the country on the grounds of them being UN observers.  Or refuse to accept wacky UN braying about the Fourth Geneva Convention applying to Israelis living in the West Bank.<br /><br />Still, the most moving part of the book is on Abu Eain, a flat-out terrorist and murderer who was made a hero by the UN.  The General Assembly vote was 75 to 21 in favor of condemning the United States for being willing to extradite this killer so he could face murder charges.  That convinced me how utterly the UN supported terrorism.<br /><br />Next, there is a section on an incident in which a loony Israeli killed two Arabs and wounded about 40 others at the Dome of the Rock.  This impressed me.  We're at the UN, which is supposed to deal with the entire world, and it is spending more than half of its time on Israel.  And it's doing so not because Israel demands any attention, but just to avoid dealing with anything important.<br /><br />After an interlude on the Falkland Islands, we go back to Israel again, and the successful attempts to rescue Arafat by sea from Lebanon.  The author is proud of this, pointing out that a failure to do this (or, say, letting Arafat be executed by the Israelis) would have jeopardized the peace between Israel and Egypt.  I think it simply shows how difficult it was even for Kirkpatrick to obtain the political strength to stand up to a pure terrorist such as Arafat.<br /><br />Guess what we get next?  More Israel, as it gets threatened with expulsion by the UN.  And as members of the US team are accused of having contacts with Arab terrorists.<br /><br />Finally, there is something the UN gets to discuss besides Israel or the Falklands, namely the shooting down of a Korean airliner by the Soviets.  And the US invasion of Grenada.<br /><br />But after that, we're back to terrorism, with the infamous 1977 Protocols to revise the 1949 Geneva Convention.  These Protocols were basically what even the New York Times called them, namely a \\"pro-terrorist document.\\"  And the United States came close to endorsing them.<br /><br />Maybe the most important part of the book is at the end, where we discover how the International Court of Justice has started to treat UN General Assembly resolutions as international law.  This depressed me a little, as I pondered the prospects of spending eternity as an international outlaw.<br /><br />Before I read this book, I felt that the conservatives in this country were a little too eager to demand special favors for ourselves at the expense of other nations.  But whether that's a valid complaint or not, I now think that a bigger problem is a UN that demands special favors for terrorists.srael or the Falklands, namely the shooting down of a Korean airliner by the Soviets.

To do otherwise would be to oppose human rights.  So I am a little surprised and saddened by the fact that there are some people who do not support Zionism.  And it's worse that some of my fellow liberals regard Zionism as something not quite, um, kosher.  That's all the more reason to read this book.<br /><br />I have to admit that some antizionist propaganda is pretty wild.  Reading it, you might think that Zionism is against human rights, or is against justice, or is against truth, or is a form of racism.  Or that Zionists are greedy, wanting more land than they somehow \\"deserve.\\"  But I have come to the opposite conclusion, namely that all these epithets are more properly applied to antizionism.  And that's another reason why you might want to read this book.<br /><br />Gil Troy points out that too many people have ignored too much antizionist hatred and vitriol for too long.  He thinks the word \\"Zionism\\" is in danger of being defined by its enemies.  And I think it may be even more insidious than that.  I think that the international community risks having many of its institutions defined by their opposition to human rights.<br /><br />The author points out that Zionism is an integral part of Judaism.  He traces the history of Judaism both in and out of the Levant.  And he reviews some of the history of modern Israel.<br /><br />Troy says that at its simplest, Zionism is simply Jewish nationalism, the understanding that Jews are a people, that Judaism is not just a religion, and that Israel is the Jewish homeland.<br /><br />I think that's an important point.  We do not begrudge the French their language, their nationalism, their religions, or their homeland.  We do not demand to internationalize their capital city of Paris, or to give Paris to the Germans on the grounds that only Germans truly love Paris.  And I could make the same comments about most other nations that we are content to allow to exist.<br /><br />The author points out the demonization of Israel that we've seen at the United Nations, such as at their conference in Durban in 2001.  And he shows how media, including CNN, the BBC, and the New York Times, have played along with dramatic anti-Israeli libels.<br /><br />I think that some antizionist Big Lies have indeed poisoned the international information supply.  And I think that we see some of the effects of this on college campuses today.  Troy advocates documenting incidents of antizionist intimidation on campus and demanding campus civility.  In addition, I think we also need to demand academic honesty from some of the faculty.<br /><br />Antizionism is a problem for all of society, not just for the Jews, Hebrew-speakers, or Israelis.  And it is a major problem for anyone who supports human rights.  I think it's a good idea to read this book and then ask oneself what one can do to help promote human rights.nt to allow to exist. <br /> <br />The author points out the demonization of Israel that we've seen at the United Nations, such as at their conference in Durban in 2001.

These expressive dogs rarely pant, they rarely bark, and they rarely are obedient.  More than any other dogs, they will look you straight in the eye.  And they yodel in approval when you show up or offer food.<br /><br />These 30-pound dogs are very handsome, as they each sit like an Anubis.  A black-and-white one will appear to be wearing a perpetual tuxedo, with ears up and a curled-up tail.  They are fast and energetic escape artists.  They are short-haired, and dislike cold or wet weather.  One problem is that many of them have a tendency to nip at people without provocation.<br /><br />The author has a discussion of top show basenjis, with pictures of several of them.  And advice for those who want to take their basenjis hunting, or racing (lure coursing), or enter their dog in obedience competitions (good luck!).  And there's plenty of advice on breeding basenjis and caring for them.<br /><br />It's a great book for those who are interested in this unusual breed.	2004-12-18

For one thing, you can see predictions for the next fifteen years and assess them.  Another virtue is being able to see how 15-year old issues stay with us.<br /><br />The authors are Protestant Christians, thus the book has some interesting discussions about Protestant Christianity in Israel.  They make the point that in the Middle East, most people are born into a religion rather than choosing it.  We find out that the Protestants have no representation at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  But that's okay, because they have their own site where Jesus was buried, namely the Garden Tomb.  My Christian friends guffawed when someone asked them if Jesus was actually buried in both places, once before the resurrection and once afterwards.<br /><br />The book points out that many Arab Christians have very racist attitudes towards Jews.  They explain this by an analogy: two hundred years ago, many American Christians had equally racist attitudes towards Blacks.  And we see a discussion of Israel's \\"anti-mission\\" law.<br /><br />There are sections about all sorts of aspects of Israeli society.  But there is an interesting emphasis on some religious issues.  These include the Jewish Temple, its history, and prospects for rebuilding it.  And there's also some material on technology, including ideas about a canal from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea (but nothing on the, um, anticommunist version of it, from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea).<br /><br />One intriguing discussion was about Meir Kahane's political party, Kach, and a Knesset antiracism law.  The focus was on getting rid of Jewish racism in the Israeli Knesset.  But I think the more interesting consequence is that antiracism legislation is more applicable to the far more prevalent Arab racism we see there.<br /><br />Overall, this is an interesting and atypical book about Israel.  I recommend it.	2004-12-18

Blame all the problems on others.<br /><br />This means asking the question, \\"Who did this to us?\\"<br /><br />Lewis points out that a better question is \\"What did we do wrong?\\" which leads naturally to \\"How do we put it right?\\"  Lewis feels that the Muslims of the Middle East have the ability to make this choice.  And he feels that the alternative is to let the suicide bomber \\"become a metaphor for the whole region,\\" after which there is a risk that there will be \\"a downward spiral of hate and spite, rage and self-pity, poverty and oppression, culminating sooner or later in yet another alien domination.\\"<br /><br />I agree.  The Arab world controls a great deal of land.  Rich land.  That land can be lost.  And if one is uncompetitive, there are others who may be willing to dominate you or your land or both.  Russians, Europeans, Americans, Chinese, Indians ... it could be just about anyone.  Or an alliance of some of them.<br /><br />This book explains how the Muslims of the Middle East got to this point.  Lewis does mention what I feel is an important moment, the big Muslim victory at Mohacs, in 1526.  Anyone who has studied the accounts of this battle knows that it was, as Lewis says, a truly decisive Muslim victory.  So it makes sense to start here and ask what happened next.<br /><br />Some people think the turning point came as early as 1571, with the battle of Lepanto.  But Lewis disagrees, explaining that only in the following century did Western economic power gained from the New World start to have a major impact.  However, Muslim military power did fall apart quickly in the 1680s, with the unsuccessful Muslim siege of Vienna and the loss of Buda.<br /><br />Lewis shows that after the 1680s, the Islamic world rapidly faded in military competitiveness.  Its helplessness was shown by Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798.  By now, most Muslims realized that there was something inherently uncompetitive about their whole society.  But what?<br /><br />Muslims knew that Christianity alone was not the secret of Western success.  Certainly, it had not been so in the past.  The answer had to be elsewhere.  Lewis explains that Western patriotism and nationalism were looked at as possibilities, as was Western military modernization in general.  But Lewis regards three other social aspects as especially significant: treatment of women, approach to science, and attitudes towards music.<br /><br />I think the author does a great job of showing how much the lack of social equality affected the Islamic world.  He shows how Western secular advances had no counterparts in an Islamic world that had few examples of secular power.  Meanwhile, Muslim science, which in the past had far surpassed the West, fell way behind it.  And Lewis spends a little, um, time, dwelling on one aspect of this, the Muslim problems in measuring time and paying attention to it.<br /><br />The Muslim world also overlooked most aspects of Westen culture: art, music, and literature.<br /><br />I tend to agree with Lewis that a variety of societal differences were major in weakening the Islamic world.  And I agree that the world has modernized enough so that Muslim society can make plenty of progress if it seriously wishes to do so.  All that is needed is for Muslims to decide that truth is an inherent value and I think they will diagnose their problems and begin to solve them.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, and I think it offers an excellent perspective on how things got to be the way they are in the Middle East.elplessness was shown by Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798.

Well, that's nothing new.  All societies have had problems in the past and will in the future.  But that ought not stop us or them from trying to learn lessons from mistakes.<br /><br />Pryce-Jones starts by showing that Arabs have been showing surprising mercilessness to each other as well as to external enemies in recent years.  And we see a reversion \\"to basic tribal and kinship structures\\" rather than a Westernization of Arab culture.<br /><br />There is an interesting discussion of the \\"shame and honor\\" mentality with some startling anecdotes that illustrate how such attitudes make progress and reform far more difficult.  And there's an explanation of how the underprivileged status of women contributes to making Arab society as a whole more backward.<br /><br />The author describes the extent of Arab support for the Germans in World War Two.  And from there he shows how the shame-honor attitudes have affected Arab relations with Israel.  Obviously, many Arabs are well aware of the fact that Israel is just one more small nation.  But Israel is omitted from most Arab maps and reference books, Arabs often avoid appearing with Israelis on public platforms, there are Arab boycotts of Israel and Israeli products, and Arab media saturate the region with antisemitic propaganda.  While this is harmful to Israel, it doesn't help Arabs; it merely gets Arab behavior to be less than rational.  Were Arafat's cronies to defeat Israel, that would help no one.  There would be a slaughter of Jews, and Arabs would keep fighting Western \\"foes\\" afterwards, convinced that their victory against the Jews was a victory over the entire Western world.  This surely would not help Arabs.<br /><br />Pryce-Jones concludes that the Arab world still has no institutions that are evolved by common consent for common purposes, therefore \\"there is nothing that can be agreed as the general good.\\"  And that the world is thus deprived of much of what the Arab people could otherwise contribute.  Islam is seen by the author as irrelevant to all this: it is not monolithic, but simply follows the prevailing culture.  And the West, especially when it supports the worst elements of Arab society, is not helping.<br /><br />This book does not leave one feeling optimistic.  I for one doubt that the Arabs will ever make a big apology to Israel for all the hostility they have shown it.  And that is, in my opinion, part of an overall problem: if Arab society continues to be dysfunctional, Arab nations will become ever more uncompetitive and hostile.  And that is a very bad combination when one has a large and rich Empire to defend.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

The question is simple.  What does one do about the fact that many minority students simply are not qualified to go to college?  As I see it, there are three solutions.  One is to simply say \\"too bad.\\"  The second is to admit severely unqualified students and try to provide them with remedial education and get them to a point where they have accomplished something.  The third choice, which I favor, is to help these students before they get to college, in grades 1 through 12, so that they can qualify legitimately.  Of course, one can do a little of all three.<br /><br />The City College of New York took the second choice in 1970, and not surprisingly, standards dropped.  About half the students were either taking English as a second language or were in SEEK, a program which gave admission to otherwise unqualified students whose family incomes were below a poverty threshold.  The graduation rate of the SEEK students was somewhere below 15%.<br /><br />Hopefully, standards are going up again now.  As a person with a love of academia, I sure hope so.  We'll see what happens.<br /><br />The author spent a year at the campus, attending classes, interviewing students, and interviewing faculty.  We see a class teaching English as a second language.  We see a few SEEK students who struggled and survived.  But still, that means just getting by, maybe on track to graduate from college with the equivalent of a tenth-grade education in most fields (although having been trained to write papers that at least looked academic in form).<br /><br />I don't know what has happened on the campus since this book was written ten years ago.  But one hopeful sign was a proposal requiring incoming students to have college preparatory training in high school.  The lack of high school college prep courses was making it too difficult for many students to accomplish anything in college.<br /><br />The alternative would be to lower standards to nothing, but then one's degree would eventually be worthless.<br /><br />Still, standards were high in some fields.  More than one quarter of the school's graduates were in engineering.  Engineering schools need to meet national standards, and this one does.  Any student could enroll in engineering, but classes were difficult and had serious prerequisites.  And many students were weeded out.<br /><br />I think the most intriguing part of the book was the question of the teaching of racist ideologies on campus.  And that meant dealing with the issue of Leonard Jeffries, a notorious teacher at the school, \\"who often implied, though rarely said outright, that blacks were superior to whites not only culturally and morally but biologically.\\"<br /><br />I agree with the implication by the author that the success of Jeffries at the school ought to be thought of not merely in political terms but also as one more instance of failure to meet academic standards.<br /><br />This was an interesting book, and I recommend it.ally be worthless. <br /> <br />Still, standards were high in some fields.

Curved space, of course.  \\"Imagine,\\" I told a cosmologist friend.  \\"Mass without Mass!  Charge without Charge!\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes,\\" said my friend. \\"Equations without Solutions.  Theories without Content.\\"<br /><br />My friend continued, sarcastically, \\"To say the Universe is empty is a mistake, caused by making a sign error in the equation 1 + 1 = 2, and getting 1 + 1 = 0.  That's the problem when you make an odd number of sign errors instead of an even number of them.  After all, there are only three kinds of cosmologists, those who can count and those who can not.\\"<br /><br />Since then, I've read books that got me to picture the Universe in other ways.  As a collection of harmonic oscillators.  As real poles in a complex plane.  As strings.  As a cellular automaton.  As a set of binary values.  And as an n-dimensional brane.<br /><br />Now we have a very interesting and award-winning monograph which gets us to think of the Universe as a droplet of superfluid Helium.  And I was reminded of my earlier conversation when the author began by saying:<br /><br />\\"A number of different vortices with an intricate structure of the multi-component order parameter have been experimentally observed in the superfluid phases of Helium-3, but the mathematics which is used to treat them is as simple as the equation 1 + 1 = 0.\\"<br /><br />Of course, by this Volovik means that two soliton walls annihilate each other.<br /><br />In any case, this is a book for some of you Acoustics People out there.  Yes, you.  Ahoy!  You who work with waves and oscillations in superfluid liquid Helium!  Abandon your futile searches for Sixth Sound.  And Fifth Sound.  Switch to Cosmology!  Here is a Model you can all understand!<br /><br />The idea of this book is to find a condensed matter system analog to support the idea that elementary particles are excitations of a more fundamental medium called the quantum vacuum.  And superfluid Helium3-A comes closest.  When the temperature is non-zero, this \\"vacuum\\" is excited.  The helium quasiparticles are very similar to the chiral elementary particles of the Standard Model.  The helium \\"collective modes are very similar to gravitational, electromagnetic, and SU(2) gauge fields, and quanta of these modes are analogs of gravitons, photons, and weak bosons.\\"<br /><br />This comparison can remove the need for the ultraviolet renormalization we see in quantum field theory.  And it may get us to dispose of quantum gravity entirely, and conclude that gravity simply is not fundamental.<br /><br />James Bjorken, in a paper on Emergent Gauge Bosons, said that he likes the fact that Volovik's model supplies a solution to the cosmological constant problem (without having to invoke supersymmetry or any fine tuning).  After all, a cold quantum liquid in equilibrium will have a pressure due to surface corrections, and that pressure will scale as an inverse power of droplet size.  Bjorken tells us in the introduction to this book that \\"the vacuum dark pressure scales with the vacuum dark energy, and thus is measured by the cosmological constant, which indeed scales as the inverse square of the 'size' of the universe.\\"  Volovik says the cosmological constant is not a constant but a dynamical quantity which is either continuously or in a stepwise manner adjusted to perturbations.<br /><br />This is how the helium droplet model serves to explain why the cosmological constant is so small, 120 orders of magnitude less than predicted by relativistic quantum field theory, and solves the coincidence problem of having the cosmological constant on the order of the present mass of the universe.  The model also provides a (non-inflationary)  rationale for the Universe being flat and answers the question of why the vacuum is (almost) non-gravitating.<br /><br />Volovik explains that his model can also be used to construct analogs of black holes in the laboratory.  \\"Quasiparticles cannot escape from the region of liquid which moves faster than they can propagate.  Such regions serve as black holes.\\"  Two superfluid liquids sliding along each other can be used to construct an analog of an event horizon.  And we might deduce something about collapse of black holes from this.<br /><br />One problem for me is that this model would make the speed of light other than a fundamental constant.  After all, the analogy is to the speed of sound in Helium3-A, which varies between 3 centimeters per second and 10,000 centimeters per second, depending on the direction of propagation!  In our world, we wouldn't notice that.  But there could be \\"external\\" observers who would.  It all sounded too eerily similar to Tom Van Flandern's discussion of the speed of light.  Van Flandern said that while the speed of light is the same for all observers, no matter what their velocities, that's true \\"for any wave in any medium, if one uses only waves of various types in that medium for the measurement.\\"  And I had given only two stars to Van Flandern's book!<br /><br />More seriously, as Volovik admits, when one goes from microscopic theories to a more phenomenological approach, one runs into problems of non-locality.<br /><br />The author tells us that so far, there has indeed been a success in using a superfluid Helium3 simulation.

But it is a great book about weather in general.<br /><br />Keen became fascinated by weather in October 1954, when \\"a wild lady named Hazel\\" visited his home.  I became fascinated by weather less than two months before that, when Hazel's, um, sister, Carol, visited my home.  Hazel and Carol were two truly impressive storms.<br /><br />Keen teaches us a little about what causes weather.  He discusses cyclones, and mentions some of the major cyclones that have hit the West.  We learn about all the different types of snow and snow crystals.  And Keen tells us about thuderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and more.  There are all sorts of statistics on rainfall and on temperature extremes.  And the author teaches us how to read weather maps!<br /><br />One of the most interesting sections was on chinooks.  The author explains that the Ute Indians knew that when one is within 10 or 20 miles to the East of a mountain range, you'll get occasional downslope winds which can exceed 100 miles per hour.  That's why they refused to set their tepees at certain places just east of the Rockies.  The white men ignored the Ute warnings and built a town (now a city) called Boulder, Colorado at one of these sites.  And sure enough, every few years, Boulder gets hit by big chinook winds.  So do Livingston, Montana, and Sheridan, Wyoming, and Bishop, California, and Carson City, Nevada.  These winds are generally very warm, and can lift the temperatures by 20 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit in a few hours.  The Chinook Indians of coastal Oregon called warm winds \\"snow-eaters,\\" and that's how the snow-eating winds downslope of the mountains wound up being called \\"chinooks!\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed this book very much.  I certainly recommend it.	2004-12-14

And it is illuminating.  We see negative stereotypes that each have for the other.  More than that, I think this book shows some of the reasons why there isn't peace.<br /><br />While some of the stereotypes are shown to be overstated, the reader will come away with a very negative picture of the people who live in the area.  Some people appeared prepared to live, and some to let live, and a few weren't prepared to do either, but very few of the people Shipler showed us seemed ready to do both.<br /><br />Shipler's description of Arab complaints about Israel were interesting.  Sure, many Arabs said they had a devotion to their land.  And that's why they needed it back from the Jews.  But instead of reacting sympathetically, I asked myself if they were for real.  If I were to act the same way, what would I do?  Demand, as a descendant of Tatars who were evicted from what is now Yalta, that the Muslim Tatars get Yalta back?  Or demand, as a Pagan, that the Dome of the Rock be removed so that we could restore the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva?<br /><br />I rarely see Arabs demand land \\"back\\" that is now lived on by other Arabs.  Nor would it make sense to anyone to \\"return\\" Warsaw to the Jews.  Worse, it seemed to me that many Arabs were saying that they would do Anything to get their land back ... except pay for it.  And that they would insist on being true Israeli citizens, except they wouldn't fight for Israel!  Since I'd never want to live in a country I couldn't support, I found it hard to sympathize with the attitudes of many Israeli Arabs.<br /><br />Shipler explained to us a common Arab complaint that the Jews are punishing the Arabs for Jewish misfortunes in Europe.  But this complaint grossly underestimates Arab blame for what happened to many Jews.  And it also tacitly and incorrectly assumes that it should be a crime for Jews to live near Arabs.<br /><br />Almost all the Jews Shipler described had given plenty of thought to whether overall Jewish behavior made sense.  They came up with different answers.  But they left me with the impression that if they ever had a chance to make good policy decisions, most of them would do it.  That's not the impression I got about the Arabs he depicted.<br /><br />I think Shipler failed to show us the big picture in this conflict.  And to me, the main point is that the Jews have rather little land.  In the long run, if everyone chooses peace, the Jews probably will wind up with at least as much land as they now have.  The Jews have options.  They can fight.  They can make allies.  They can flee.  They can even convert.  Yes, they can get badly hurt.  But my point is that they have shown great resiliance and have surprisingly little to lose.  Their land has few resources.  In my opinion, contrary to popular belief, they might well survive the loss of several wars.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Arab side is unlikely to lose a big war.  But their Empire would be gone if they ever lost one.  They have an enormous amount of land and huge resources, and seem to act as though they can't lose it.  Instead, there is a huge focus on fighting a war for an arbitrary cause which, if they win it, will give them virtually nothing.<br /><br />Finally, this whole struggle is being fought primarily between those who believe Jews ought to have human rights in Israel and those who do not.  That's not very symmetrical.  I have to ask myself if Shipler was helping anyone by allowing folks to get the impression that these two points of view are equally valid.  Perhaps it would have been better if he had taken a stand, and simply said that both sides are hurting.  And that the Arabs have a choice to make: do they want it to be better for everyone or worse for everyone?  That would have allowed me to give his book a couple more stars.en plenty of thought to whether overall Jewish behavior made sense.  They came up with different answers.

And that some Muslim nations are behaving like enemies to us.  But which ones?  Iraq, when Saddam Hussein ruled it?  Iran?  Syria?  Afghanistan under the Taliban?<br /><br />How about Saudi Arabia, which has been an American ally?<br /><br />This book describes Wahhabi extremism and gives a useful history of Saudi relations with the West.<br /><br />The most interesting portion of the book is the chapter titled \\"Religious Colonialism,\\" which describes what Schwartz describes as the Wahhabi conquest of American Islam.  The author states that American Muslims are a rather diverse community.  However, Wahhabis and Wahhabi money have taken over the leadership of many Muslim organizations.  These include the Council on Islamic-American Relations (CAIR), the American Muslim Council (AMC), the American Muslim Alliance (AMA), and the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA).  Wahhabi money also supports some Hamas operational groups such as the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development (HLF).<br /><br />In addition, the Wahhabis have successfully lobbied to get non-Muslims to see them as the premier representatives of American Muslims.  Schwartz notes a letter from a number of Christian organizations, including representatives of the United Church of Christ, the National Council of the Churches of Christ, the Presbyterian Church, the National Council of Catholic Bishops and a leading body of the Methodist Church.  That letter protested alleged unfair media scrutiny of AMC activites and referred to AMC in its first line as \\"the premier, mainstream Muslim group in Washington.\\"<br /><br />The author concludes that we ought to search for reconciliation among the major monotheistic religions: Islam, Judaism, and Christianity.  Of course, as a Pagan, I see not merely the need but also the difficulty of accomplishing this.  Pagan religions are generally compatible, while monotheistic ones generally are not.  Schwartz also concludes that America ought not try to maintain any political alliance with a Wahhabi Saudi Arabia.  He looks forward to an overthrow of the Wahhabis there.<br /><br />I'm deducting a star from my evaluation, because I think Schwartz goes a little overboard in his positive evaluations of all non-Wahhabi versions of Islam.  But I think that those who have been unaware of the nature of Saudi Islam ought to read this book.lso concludes that America ought not try to maintain any political alliance with a Wahhabi Saudi Arabia.

These same nations had supported Israel when Arab armies had attacked it in 1948.<br /><br />I think it is worth reading books today that were written soon after the Six Day War just to see what was and was not said back then, before more recent historical revisionists went to work.<br /><br />Arnoni starts by demonstrating that Israel \\"was not established as a creature of British imperialism but in defiance of it.\\"  He then shows the extent to which Arab states supported Germany in World War Two.  This support extended to Vichy-governed Syria and Lebanon, where the Germans didn't even want Arab support against their Vichy allies.  The author also discusses the Mufti al-Husseini and his support for the Germans, as well as the support of Nasser, who became the Egyptian President, for the Mufti.<br /><br />Another interesting point that the author reminds us of is this: there was never a Jordanian ethnic group, culture, or history.  Jordan was simply a British invention, and may represent the most artificial imperialistic state creation in history.  Meanwhile, Arnoni explains that Israel is the product of the first of a succession of national liberation movements.  Its successors can not be justified unless it is justified.  The Arabs have no more right to exterminate Israel than Israelis do to exterminate the Arabs and their states.<br /><br />The author reminds us of the Arab insistence in 1967 to destroy Israel.  As for Arab \\"supporters\\" who deny this, Arnoni says, \\"the Arabs deserve to be taken seriously, and not treated by their friends and supporters like incoherent little children or madmen.\\"  We need to take note of Arab deeds and admissions.  And it is an insult to Arabs for those who purport to support them to pretend that their record either does not exist or does not count.<br /><br />Arnoni concluded at the time that the most decisive difficulty in obtaining peace in the region was the Arab attitude.  And that Arabs are confronted by a decision: construction or destruction.  He finished by saying, \\"When all is said and considered, the final answer is theirs.\\"<br /><br />From the perspective of 36 years later, we can see that the most recent Arab choice has been destruction.  For the sake of everyone, that has to change.<br /><br />I recommend this book.the time that the most decisive difficulty in obtaining peace in the region was the Arab attitude.

Still, that does not mean that mission operations is an art form.  Planning is essential.  Metrics are needed to at least estimate costs and workforce.  And this book provides support to those who need to plan for or perform mission operations tasks.<br /><br />The book does an excellent job of describing mission operations functions and products.  There's a very good section on how to develop a mission operations concept.  And there's some good advice on assessing mission operations complexity.<br /><br />While the operations engineers may see operations as the phase in which design errors are finally solved or worked around, we're warned to avoid letting them simply use the spacecraft as an engineering test bed.<br /><br />This text includes valuable reference material on spacecraft navigation and maneuvering, communications architectures, ground systems, and data processing.  There's also a good chapter on spacecraft anomalies.  After all, the anomalies are probably the aspects of a space mission that will stand out most to the folks in operations.<br /><br />I think one of the best parts of this book may be the appendix that contains mission summaries for fourteen space missions (ACE, COBE, ERBS, FAST, FUSE, GRO, ICE, IMP, IUE, SAMPEX, SOHO, SWAS, TRMM, and XTE).  These summaries include a mission statement, launch information, a description of the spacecraft bus, payload, and science instruments, the orbit phases, a description of the ground system, an overview of mission operations, and a schedule.<br /><br />All in all, it is quite a useful book.	2004-12-13

That gives the authors plenty of flexibility in choosing their topics.  And I'll concede that the material on \\"propositional calculus\\" in Chapter Five does not involve \\"calculus.\\"  You can understand this book without having gone past high school algebra.<br /><br />These authors have the right idea when they say \\"an undergraduate mathematics textbook should teach the student to solve problems.\\"  This text sure does!  And they even advise their students to start by trying the homework problems before reading the text and read it only when they get stuck!  Of course, I think many students do that in the first place.<br /><br />A very good feature of this text is that it has over 600 figures and tables.  We see Venn diagrams, Hasse diagrams, tree diagrams, graphs, flowcharts, state diagrams, and much more.<br /><br />I liked the part on graph theory, including the \\"Hungarian Algorithm\\" to solve the matching problem.  And there is a good chapter on Boolean Algebra, and the use of Karnaugh maps.  After that is an excellent section on finite state machines and Turing machines, which is followed by a chapter on formal languages.  And there's plenty about mathemtical games.  The whole book is enjoyable, and I think it would be plenty of fun to teach from it or learn from it.	2004-12-13

But it is still a very nice introduction to some of the more interesting parts of physics.  Not every exciting aspect of physics is covered.  But everything that is covered is a stimulating area in which plenty of noteworthy things are happening.<br /><br />There's a nice section by Clifford Will on the renaissance of general relativity.  And he makes the point that cosmologists have long been plagued by having their predicted ages of the Universe come out just a teeny bit less than the ages of (pick one) the Earth or the Milky Way Galaxy.  Alan Guth and Paul Steinhardt have a nice article on the inflationary universe.  And Stephen Hawking has some nice words about the question of whether spacetime has a boundary.  Chris Isham discusses quantum gravity.  All these are subjects that get us in the proper mood for the chapter I liked best, by Malcolm Longair, on the new astrophysics.  This 115-page article is a wonderful introduction to the field.<br /><br />Now that we've looked at something big (the universe), we study some systems that appear self-organized.  We start with an article by David Thouless on condensed matter in less than three dimensions.  I liked this, he even discussed \\"third sound\\" in superfluid helium, something which as an \\"acoustics person\\" I find fascinating.  And there's another good article on low temperature physics, by Anthony Leggett.  The next chapter in the self-organization section is by Peter Knight, on quantum optics (lasers); he has a good discussion of the generation of ultrashort optical pulses.  And there is a chapter about phase transitions and critical point phenomena by Alastair Bruce and David Wallace.<br /><br />Those who have studied Biology have seen the incredible amount of order in living systems.  But where does this order come from?  What about the order in non-Biological systems, such as the planets going around the Sun?  Or, better yet, snowflakes?  What forces produce such self-organization?  It's nonlinear dynamics and the presence of constraints maintaining a system far from equilibrium that turn out to be the basic mechanism.  We have a nice chapter by Gregoire Nicolis that discusses it.  And next is a chapter on chaos.  By this, we mean systems that are deterministic but unpredictable.  Joseph Ford discusses systems that can make use of inputs that arrive in a random manner.<br /><br />The final portion of the book deals with the ultimate structure of matter.  We start with an article by Abner Shimony, which discusses the importance of the conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics, showing that simple \\"hidden variable theories\\" are impossible.  Frank Close explains the quark structure of matter and Abdus Salam supplies an overview of particle physics.  H. M. Georgi tells us of the adventures people have had trying to use Lie Groups, especially SU(5), to come up with grand unified theories.  But he explains that they predicted proton decay and never found it.  And in his chapter on quantum field theories, he speculates that maybe we're making a mistake to try to guess the nature of reality for very small distances, rather than work our way down to it from what we can see at bigger distances.  And there is a very readable chapter on gauge theories by John Taylor, who includes a discussion of quark confinement.<br /><br />These simply aren't the topics we're used to seeing when we take high school or college physics, and it's wonderful to have them in one book so that one can see how many exciting topics there are in this field.  Yes, there's been plenty of advances on all these topics since 1989, but this isn't a bad way to get started.  If you are thinking of doing physics, this will show some of what many physicists have been doing for the past couple of decades.  If you have a little technical training and simply want a book for the layman that has relatively little math,it's a good choice.  We may need an updated version soon!ated version soon!	2004-12-13

Then we learn about Green's functions in a Fermi system at T = 0 and Feynman diagram representations of them.<br /><br />After that, we study Bose liquids and gases. That means the properties of superfluids, including quasi-particles (phonons and rotons) and quantized vortex filaments. And the book shows how to apply Green's functions to Bose liquids. There's an interesting section on the disintegration of quasi-particles. Next, we're introduced to Green's functions for T &#62; 0, using the Matsubara operators to reduce the complexity of the diagrams.<br /><br />And then we're ready to learn about superconductors. That means learning about Cooper pairing and superfluid Fermi gases, and learning how to apply Green's functions to them. And, not surprisingly, we learn the Ginzburg-Landau equations, so that we can determine the behavior of superconductors in magnetic fields in temperature ranges near the transition point.<br /><br />There's also a chapter on electrons in the crystal lattice, including the de Hass-van Alphen effect (which refers to a metal's magnetic susceptibility oscillating as the strength of a strong magnetic field changes - due to the quantization of the energy levels of the electrons) and electron-phonon interactions. And there's a nice chapter on magnetism.<br /><br />In the preface, the authors state &#34;we must again stress that this book is part of a course of theoretical physics and in no way attempts to be a textbook of solid state theory.&#34;  Are they kidding? This course is an excellent way to learn solid state physics.dding? This course is an excellent way to learn solid state physics.	2004-12-12

While the war lasted from November, 1947 until March, 1949, the bulk of it was from the first big Arab operation against the Jews on January 14, 1948 until the final significant Israeli action (shooting down five British planes that invaded Israeli airspace on January 7, 1949).<br /><br />One curious aspect of this war is that prior to it, no Jewish army had ever taken, occupied, and held an Arab Muslim city, town, or village in the Levant.  Not in the entire 1300-year history of Islam.  That's why many people were surprised to see the Jews actually fight, and there were comments about it that were absurdly insulting to both sides, such as \\"Man bites dog.\\"  Kurzman explicitly makes the point that the fighting on both sides was quite amateurish.<br /><br />This history may explain the shock it caused when the Jews broke their 1300-year losing streak by taking and holding Deir Yassin, on April 9, 1948.  Many Arabs would have considered that an unforgivable affront even had there been no Arab casualties.  But it was even worse when over 100 Arabs died in the battle, including quite a few civilians.  This helped spur exaggerations of what had occurred, and this in turn contributed to the decision of a huge number of Arabs, including 40,000 in Haifa, to flee their homes in the ensuing weeks.<br /><br />These are some of the reasons why a few history books about this war are very strange, making it appear as if only one side fought in the war.  And it is why a comprehensive, detailed, well-referenced, and well-researched book such as this one is so valuable.<br /><br />There's an enormous amount of fascinating material in this book, but I was especially intrigued by one small portion which listed seven Arab arguments against permitting a Jewish state to exist in the region, as well as the Jewish replies.  To me, this truly showed the extreme weakness of the Arab cause.  I agreed with the Jews on a couple of the points and with the Arabs on none of them.  Here are the seven Arab points and my assessment of them, so you can see for yourselves:<br /><br />1) The Balfour Declaration had no legal basis, broke British promises to the Arabs, and could be fulfilled without a Jewish state.  In addition, no international organization had a right to define territorial rearrangements.<br /><br />I disagree.  While the Balfour Declaration had no legal basis, the League of Nations version did.  And while a Jewish home could exist without a state, the British 1939 White Paper had rendered that impossible.  International organizations were not defining borders by recommending a state.<br /><br />2) The Arabs, a majority in the region, were entitled to do what they pleased.<br /><br />Even the majority needs to allow for minority rights.  And the Jews were the majority in the partitioned area earmarked for the Jews, even before any Arabs fled.  In addition, one reason the Jews were a minority in the region was that so many of them had been kept out of the Levant by force.  A Jewish state would permit many of them to enter.<br /><br />3) The Jews were descendants of Khazars, not Hebrews.<br /><br />Most Jews were actually descendants of Hebrews, not Khazars.

And they had.<br /><br />4) The proposed partition boundaries were idiotic and would start a war.<br /><br />Yes, the recommended boundaries were idiotic.  But they were not unfair to the Arabs.  And the Arabs were the ones demanding a war, not the Jews.<br /><br />5)  Jews ought not be permitted to intrude into land that belongs to Arabs.<br /><br />It doesn't belong to Arabs when they sell it to the Jews.<br /><br />6) The Jewish state and Arab state recommended in the partition would not be able to cooperate economically.<br /><br />That could be true, but so what?<br /><br />7) Zionism was artificial and European and would corrupt Arab culture and tradition.<br /><br />This takes the cake.  Arab aggressors were complaining that it is a crime against nature to change the status quo.  But the Arabs were changing the status quo by demanding to reduce Jewish rights.

Moderation in all things, except, Allah forbid, moderation!<br /><br />Oh, there are plenty of nice ideas in this book.  One of them is that it's not a bad idea for a society to permit Women to have educations.  My grandmother, born a Muslim, went to school, but only for one day.  Now we hear one Islamic thinker, Tusuf al Qaradawy, who boasts about his four daughters.  The eldest has a Ph.D. in nuclear physics.  The next one has a Ph.D. in chemistry.  The third is studying for a Ph.D. in engineering, while the fourth is going to study for one in genetics.  His three sons are successful as well.  Good for them!<br /><br />I think it is a terrific idea to study the real world.  Such studies often highlight the fact that truth is an inherent value.  And that is likely to help people be more prosperous and happier.  I think it only makes sense to allow everyone to contribute to one's society.  And I think it makes sense to get along with one's neighbors, so that everyone can be better off.<br /><br />Islamic reform sounds like a useful idea.<br /><br />Still, there is one small thing that makes me wary of this \\"Islam without fear.\\"  Namely, I ask myself what would happen were everyone to act the way this book suggests in international affairs.  If that were to happen, we'd all kill ourselves off in wars.  Once at war, those Women in nuclear physics would build some bombs, the chemists would design new poisons, the engineers would figure out how to deliver them, and the geneticists would design some biological weapons.<br /><br />If you don't believe me, just see how the New Islamists want to deal with their Israeli neighbors.  There isn't the slightest thought of \\"live and let live.\\"  Nor is there any idea of coming up with something which gives equal rights to everyone.  Nope,  it's just pure greed.  The attitude is simple.  We're important.  They aren't.  We deserve more.  But that always leads to strife in the long run.<br /><br />If this is going to be a political deal with the extremists, it will not work.  Think about it.  It is not a good idea to say, \\"We'll help you attack the United States and Israel if you'll let our Women go to school.\\"<br /><br />Making an alliance with an extremist position has huge drawbacks.  Consider the German Pagans.  For centuries, they had no rights at all: they could be killed on sight.  Finally, in the 1930s, they were tolerated for the first time in over a thousand years.  And what happened?  In 1945, Germany lost the war.  And the Pagans were discredited.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, Germany in 1940 was anything but moderate.  And I think the New Islamists could well fall into the same trap.Think about it.

Well, yes.  And we do not need Gold to tell us that.  We can see what rights (or lack of them) exist for women there.  Or for Christians.  And how Jews and Pagans are relatively lucky: for the most part they do not get to be in this nation at all.  We ought to know that Saudi Arabia was one of the very few nations that was unwilling to vote for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<br /><br />Saudi Arabia has never been in a war with Israel.  Yet, for those of you who know a few Saudis, try this: ask them what they think of Zionism.  It may be an eye-opener for you.<br /><br />My point is not that Saudis are bad people.  Quite the contrary.  I think we ought to try to figure out why many otherwise friendly, goodhearted and bright Saudis have rather strange attitudes on some issues.  And I think this book helps us do that.<br /><br />The author raises some issues that I think are relevant.  First, what is the role of Wahhabism in determining the attitudes of many Saudis on questions involving the West, Israel, women, or non-Muslims?  Second, where does Wahhabi money and other support go, and why?  Third, just what connections are there between Wahhabi money and terrorist attacks on Israel and the United States?<br /><br />Gold's conclusion is that the Saudis must be held accountable for their actions.  And this includes establishing international codes of conduct that will outlaw some of the incitement we see, including hatred taught in mosques, textbooks, and the media.  Unless this is done, the Saudis will continue to preach peace to the West while funding terrorist groups that make peace impossible.  Gold thinks that sooner or later, the Saudis will have to choose what side they are on.  But I'm afraid that eventually, the Saudis may not be in a position to make a useful choice.	2004-12-10

Can a computer program running on a computer demonstrate aspects of human intelligence?  If so, what tests could be performed to demonstrate this?<br /><br />Well, it is easy to think of some tests.  Here are seven simple ones.  1) Look up a word in a dictionary.  2) Add a very long column of numbers.  3)  Play Chess really well.  4)  Play Go really well.  5)  Solve a really difficult research problem in theoretical physics.  6)  Write a really good novel.  7)  Compose a really good classical symphony.<br /><br />Today, computers have passed tests 1), 2), and 3).  But they play chess well by using a very poor program indeed, relying instead on a computer that is extremely fast and has plenty of memory.  We're seeing really good computers.  But the programs we're seeing are awful.<br /><br />Maybe better tests would be to see if a team of a human plus a computer could do much better than two humans with no computer at each of those seven tasks.  And here, I'm sure the answer is yes to many of these seven tasks, and could easily be yes to all of them.<br /><br />Still, those who work in the field of artificial intelligence have wanted to come up with programs that exhibit some intelligent features.  And one test they have tried is one proposed by Turing in 1950: if a human or computer may be in the next room and you exchange messages with her, him, or it, (maybe at a rate of one message every 15 seconds), can you tell with better than 70% accuracy after 5 minutes if the entity in the other room is human or computer?<br /><br />The book discusses whether or not such a test has much to do with intelligence or artificial intelligence.  And it describes the failure of programs to pass that test so far.<br /><br />In 2000, several programs were entered into a contest to try to mimic a human in this manner.  No judge thought a program was in fact a human.  And worse than that, the book tells us that all nine of the following questions were answered correctly by all the humans, while no computer got any of the nine questions right:<br /><br />1)  What is the color of a blue truck?<br /><br />2)  Where is Sue's nose when Sue is in her house?<br /><br />3)  What happens to an ice cube in a hot drink?<br /><br />4)  Altogether how many feet do four cats have?<br /><br />5)  How is the father of Andy's mother related to Andy?<br /><br />6)  What does the letter 'M' look like when turned upside down?<br /><br />7)  What comes next after A1, B2, C3?<br /><br />8)  Reverse the digits in 41.<br /><br />9)  PLEASE IMITATE MY TYPING STYLE.<br /><br />That shows how utterly the programs failed Turing's test.<br /><br />In short, programs today are horrible at understanding, reasoning, learning, judgment, and creativity.<br /><br />I liked this book.  It showed that no matter what one thinks of machine intelligence, AI people have made shockingly little progress in the past fifty years.y all the humans, while no computer got any of the nine questions right: <br /> <br />1)  What is the color of a blue truck? <br />2)  Where is Sue's nose when Sue is in her house? <br />3)  What happens to an ice cube in a hot drink? <br />4)  Altogether how many feet do four cats have? <br />5)  How is the father of Andy's mother related to Andy? <br />6)  What does the letter 'M' look like when turned upside down? <br />7)  What comes next after A1, B2, C3? <br />8)  Reverse the digits in 41. <br />9)  PLEASE IMITATE MY TYPING STYLE. <br /> <br />That shows how utterly the programs failed Turing's test. <br /> <br />In short, programs today are horrible at understanding, reasoning, learning, judgment, and creativity. <br /> <br />I liked this book.

Of course it is.  Some groups of people are very superstitious.  Some are more mystical than others.  And some groups dwell on conspiracy theories to a surprising extent.<br /><br />Pipes is right to being up this topic.  He simply had so many experiences in which he heard some baffling conspiracy theories from otherwise intelligent people that he decided to look into the matter.<br /><br />The author points out that all these conspiracy theories lead to Arab misunderstanding of the world around them.  That's not good for anyone.  In addition, they have enabled plenty of snooty feelings of superiority among Westerners, some of whom arrogantly see Arabs as inferior just because they act the way Westerners themselves behaved a few decades ago.<br /><br />Pipes gives some examples of the conspiracy mentality.  He shows how Nasser used it to misanalyze the Egyptian defeat in the Six Day War of 1967.  And how others used it to tell fantastic stories about Israeli plans to acquire a rather large Empire, including not merely nearby cities such as Beirut, Damascus, El Arish, and Amman, but faraway ones such as Baghdad or Medina.<br /><br />This attitude has led to a surprising evaluation of Zionism.  That is, I can see being very angry with the government or policies of some nation.  But I am surprised that anyone would find fault with the idea of a nation.  Zionism is simply a philosophy of human rights for everyone, including Jews.  Some Zionists may be good, and some may be bad.  But Pipes shows that to many Arab conspiracy mentalities, Zionism itself is ominous and threatening.  So much so that they are often in fear of their own compatriots being secret agents for Zionism (whatever that may mean)!  And it allows them to believe simultaneously that the Zionists control the US and vice-versa.<br /><br />The author asks if the conspiracy theorists are being sincere or manipulative.  His conclusion is that for the most part, the politicians believe much of what they say.  This is often true even when their statements appear to be in direct violation of facts, implausible, vague, unrealistic or illogical.<br /><br />I think the best point that Pipes makes is that the environment in the Arab world is conducive to such beliefs.  There really are quite a few conspiracies in that part of the world.  There really is plenty of rewriting of history, so many people instinctively mistrust what they are told (only to replace it with even more dubious ideas).  And the media in that part of the world are extremely untrustworthy as well.  However, the mistrust and skepticism all this generates leads not to a more rational approach to reality but to more gullibility.<br /><br />This is a very good book, and it shows that there is a need for education and modernization in the Arab world.  And that more than anything, everyone needs to have a respect for truth and a willingness to cull lies and dispose of them.lusion is that for the most part, the politicians believe much of what they say.

British attitudes towards the Jews of Israel have had their ups and downs.  This book tells us where things now stand.<br /><br />We see that violent antisemitic incidents have gone up somewhat in the past couple of decades.  And I noted with interest that such incidents tend to occur at about the same time as anti-Jewish violence in Israel.  That is, we're seeing violence that is in sympathy with the terrorist attacks in Israel.<br /><br />Jonathan Sacks makes some excellent points.  First that antisemitism exists whenever people simultaneously believe that Jews are so powerful that they are responsible for the evils of the world and that Jews are so weak that they can be attacked with impunity.  He dismisses the possibility that such attitudes are caused by Jews, given the extreme antisemitism we see in countries where there are no Jews at all.  And he points out how this hatred puts the hater in at least as much risk as the hated.<br /><br />We see a silly essay from Antony Lerman explaining that antizionism is not antisemitism.  But surely, the fact that one makes antisemitic remarks is insufficient to prove that one is Not an antisemite!<br /><br />Jonathan Freedland also argues that antizionists may be sincere, consistent, and not antisemites.  After all, they say that Israel's existence caused the dispossession of Arabs!  But he's wrong.  Yes, they say it.  But they don't care if they are telling the truth or not.  And in fact, what they say is false.<br /><br />Douglas Davis writes an excellent essay exposing outright antisemitism by the BBC.  And Winston Pickett examines the use of standard antisemitic \\"topoi\\" by some of the British media.<br /><br />My favorite of the articles was by Melanie Phillips, on Christian theology and the new antisemitism.  She shows how many so-called liberals, for theological reasons, have decided to support the terrorists and describe the victims as monsters.  And that's a problem that I think extends well beyond the fate of the small nation of Israel.reasons, have decided to support the terrorists and describe the victims as monsters.

I found it misleading.  The author told plenty of anecdotes about Israel.  But these were not very sympathetic to anyone.<br /><br />There are Arabs and Jews living in the West Bank.  That's disputed land.  I was interested in seeing how the author treated them.  Did he admit that the Jews on the West Bank were mainly natives living in their homeland?  No, instead he implied that they were there for not entirely legitimate religious reasons.  And he concentrated on questions of revenge, as if that made it legitimate or illegitimate for people to live in their homeland!<br /><br />Rees also spent quite some time discussing the grave of a Jewish murderer, Baruch Goldstein.  I think this was to show a false and misleading symmetry between the West Bank Jews, a people who simply want the rights of human beings, and some of the Arabs who are trying to deny them the rights of human beings.<br /><br />If you read this book, you'll probably come away with the impression that both sides are wicked aggressors.

Let me explain what I mean by Right and Left and then tell you where Hazony is in this spectrum.<br /><br />People on the Right want to, as a priority, help themselves and their close allies.  That's what they know they can be good at.  When this plan works, they become more productive and the whole society benefits.  But there is a risk (that the Right is willing to take), namely that they'll help themselves so much at the expense of others that society as a whole will not benefit.  And from there, it is a short step to harming society enough so that they are brought down with it.<br /><br />People on the Left want to, as a priority, help all of society.  That's what they know they can be fair at.  When this plan works, the people they help generally reciprocate, and everyone benefits.  But there is a risk (that the Left is willing to take), namely that the rest of society may benefit a little, but only by taking advantage of the Left and its allies.  And from there, it is a short step to having thugs, not the rest of society, become the ones who truly take advantage of the Left's support, so society as a whole is harmed.<br /><br />I'm on the Left and Hazony is on the Right.  I'm first and foremost a citizen of the world.  He's first and foremost a Jewish Israeli.  And in this book, Hazony makes some interesting points about those in Israel who have gone too far off course on the Left.  But I was always concerned that Hazony was about to go off course to the Right.<br /><br />Hazony's targets are those who feel that Zionism is no longer needed (as well as those who feel it was never a good idea).  I have no problem with that.  Hazony describes the Biltmore Conference in May of 1942 at which the delegates voted overwhelmingly (478 to 4) for a Jewish state.  There's no doubt that a Jewish state was needed then (both for Jews and for human society as a whole).  And there is no reason to believe that it isn't just as necessary today, if only to protect the Jews of Israel.  In addition, why aren't those asking for an end to Zionism asking for an end to French nationalism, German nationalism, and an end to all other nationalities?<br /><br />Hazony discusses Herzl in detail.  And he shows how the British wound up adopting the infamous White Paper in May of 1939 that certainly made a Jewish state a necessity, whether one was established or not.<br /><br />The author shows how Ben-Gurion really tried very hard to establish a Jewish state.  And how some on the Left, especially Buber, went overboard and tried to avoid doing anything that might require the use of force.<br /><br />However, I think Anita Shapira is right to say that Hazony's Ben-Gurion comes across as monolithic, and that Hazony does not discuss the times when Ben-Gurion emphasized that Zionism is simply part of human rights, and that Israelis were to be free people within the family of nations.  Clearly, these types of statements, making Israel a state for everyone, sound much better to me than they do to Hazony.  I think Hazony ought to have presented a more nuanced and more accurate picture of Ben-Gurion.  He should have told us that Ben-Gurion for many years regarded modern Zionism as unconnected to ancient Jewish history.  On the other hand, Hazony is correct that once Israel became a state, Ben-Gurion began to talk more about ancient Israel.  And this is actually not a big issue for me: we all know that many Israelis take ancient Jewish history very seriously and many do not.<br /><br />In my opinion, Hazony exaggerates the importance and extent of antizionism in Israel, both historically and at present.  Yes, there are a number of people in Israeli academia who present a revisionist and inaccurate view of history.  And that is a serious matter.  But most Israelis have no trouble telling the difference between the human rights in Israel and lack of human rights, especially for Jews, in neighboring Arab nations.<br /><br />I think Hazony is not asking the reader to accept Zionism uncritically.  And he's certainly not asking Israelis to be greedy or unjust.  Far from it.  He's asking all of us to reject antizionist lies.  And he's asking Israeli Jews to demand their rights as human beings rather than allow themselves to be pressured into adopting the political positions of their Arab neighbors.<br /><br />The issue of whether Israel is a Jewish state or not is similar to the issue of whether France is a French state or not.  Until we're ready to get the French to abandon their flag and national anthem, I see no reason to ask if the Israelis ought to abandon theirs.  And that's why I think this book is worth reading.hts in Israel and lack of human rights, especially for Jews, in neighboring Arab nations.   <br /> <br />I think Hazony is not asking the reader to accept Zionism uncritically.

Actually, anyone could figure that out just by looking at a map.  And when one visits Israel, well, it sure looks like the Middle East.  The people look Middle Eastern.  The language is Middle Eastern.  And you can bet the food is Middle Eastern.<br /><br />Rejwan discusses the linguistic evidence that Israelis and Arabs have plenty of common culture.  That certainly makes sense.<br /><br />But this book goes beyond that to envision a pluralist society.  Well, does that mean pluralism in Israel's Arab neighbors?  So that Jews can be part of the societies in those nations?<br /><br />If pluralism means that Israel gives everyone human rights, that's fine.  But Israel also has a purpose: to serve as the Jewish homeland, the Jewish capital, a refuge for Jews if they need one, and a place where Jewish rights will not be infringed upon.  That's no more than the rights other nations afford their nationals.  Let's see if that counts as pluralism.  I think it does.  But Rejwan never agreed.<br /><br />We then see a discussion of Arab antisemitism.  And the author thinks it's overrated.  The idea of an Arab slaughter of Jews is preposterous to him.  It is as if the Arabs are merely, um, here.  And not special or anything.  And as if they don't really do much, so they won't really kill Jews.<br /><br />But I don't buy that argument.  This book was written six years ago.  And Arabs have indeed been killing Jews.  And I can't agree with the author about Arab antisemitism being a mere political tool.  One could have said the same thing about German antisemitism in 1900, but look what it became in just forty years.<br /><br />Yes, Arabs and Jews did live together for centuries.  But most of the time, Jews were dhimmis.  Are most Arabs really willing to live with Jews as equals?  Rejwan hasn't convinced me of that.<br /><br />On the other hand, Rejwan does a splendid job of analyzing the complaints about Israel being an alien European entity.  The Israelis are indeed Middle Eastern, and we ought to encourage people such as Rejwan who point this out.<br /><br />Rejwan would have done well to extend such arguments to the Law of Return (which is no more than similar laws other nations have with respect to what they see as their nationals).  And he might have exchanged the concept of the myth of redemption for the very real act of immigration.<br /><br />Rejwan cites some statistics from a 1988 poll.  72 percent of Israeli Arabs objected to the Law of Return.  Um, without the Law of Return, Israel would lose much of its national purpose.  70 percent of Israeli Arabs regarded Zionism as racist.  Um, really?  All Zionism amounts to is human rights.  Is that racist?  Obviously not.  1 percent of Israeli Arabs regarded themselves as Zionists, 47 percent of them were antizionists.  This makes no sense to me.  For me, the question \\"Are you a Zionist\\" is no different than \\"Do you support human rights?\\"  I can't see a reason to say no.  Rejwan should have taken the time to say this.  But he didn't.<br /><br />Rejwan thinks Israel is on the right track.  I think the proper question is whether the Arabs are on the right track.

Representatives sat in the alphabetical order of their nations, so he sat between representatives of Iraq and Israel.  After his first speech about the Middle East, an American newspaperwoman asked him how it had gone over.  He replied that both the Iraqi and Israeli delegates had thanked him.<br /><br />\\"Christ!\\" said the newspaperwoman.  \\"Was it as bad as that?\\"<br /><br />The author points out that we all ought to remember these words when we hear explanations about how the Arab and Israeli positions are to be reconciled.<br /><br />This book does an excellent job of tracing the history of Zionism.  We see the ideas of Herzl, who saw Zionism as the means to normalize the Jewish people.  We see those who saw Zion as a refuge.  And we see Balfour, who viewed Zion as a stimulus to Jewish creativity.<br /><br />And we see how the British failed to govern the Mandate wisely.  How they tried to please the Jews by letting them immigrate and buy land but placate the Arabs by letting their worst thug out of prison and making him the Mufti of Jerusalem.  (How the latter can be called a \\"pro-Arab\\" act is beyond me, of course).  And we see the British finally capitulate to Arab terror by producing the White Paper of 1939, which strongly limited immigration of Jews to Mandate territory.<br /><br />O'Brien devotes a fair amount of time to a very good question.  Namely, after World War Two, why did the British Labour government devote so much energy to keeping the White Paper in force?  By that time, the United States was insisting that Britain accept 100,000 refugees into the Mandate territory at once.  The Labour platform had insisted on dropping the White Paper and giving the Jews their state.  Britain had a unique opportunity to make everyone happy: the Jews, the Americans, and the Arabs (by partitioning the Mandate and giving the Arabs some of it when they had originally promised them nothing).  It was clearly in Britain's interest to do this.  The author explains that the reason Britain did the opposite was because its Prime Minister, Attlee and its Foreign Minister, Bevin were obsessed with depriving the Jews of what the Jews wanted, no matter how much it hurt Britain and no matter how wrong it might be.<br /><br />In short, these two were indeed so antisemitic that they thought it was worth it to damage their country and Empire just to hurt a few Jews!  It's amazing, but I have to concede O'Brien's point.<br /><br />Of course, such illogical behavior got the reward it deserved when Jews became even more convinced of the need for a state, and the Soviet Union decided to support Israeli independence just to get a free shot at the British.  Meanwhile, America's recognition of Israel did not damage its relations with the Arabs, while Britain's opposition to Israel simply helped Britain make more Arab enemies.<br /><br />I was intrigued by what O'Brien, a UN person, had to say about Folke Bernadotte.  And I found it interesting that Bernadotte had complained about Jewish \\"arrogance and hostility\\" to, of all people, the gentle Israeli Foreign Minister, Moshe Sharett.<br /><br />The book continues with a history of Israel's predicament as a nation under siege.  While the author sympathizes with Israel's plight, he does refer to some of the times when Israel demanded its rights as examples of \\"hubris.\\"  I think that it is fair to call it that on the occasions when Israel managed to be opposed by both superpowers.  After all, such demands could well have led to Israel's annihilation.  And O'Brien does refuse to find fault with Israel's overall foreign policy, saying he can't see what other options Israel has had.<br /><br />The author speculates that the Arabs may decide to live with Israel some day, and Israel may learn not to exhibit hubris.  And there may be peace in the region eventually, although O'Brien is not as hopeful as most other writers about the region.  I was left with a very different impression, namely that one day people may learn to demand their rights and get away with it.<br /><br />I recommend this book.o demand their rights and get away with it.

Fantasy?  No, it's Stanislaw Lem's preposterous farce about the future.  And it was written over 30 years ago, so we can see if we are getting any closer to it.<br /><br />In this story, very few real things remain in the world.  Almost everything is an illusion, brought about by very specific illusion-causing chemicals.<br /><br />Maybe the best thing about this farce is the multitude of hilarious words that Lem invents.  I've no idea how Michael Kandel managed to translate them so wonderfully from Polish.  I liked the mimicretins (computers that play stupid in order, once and for all, to be left in peace).  And when Ijon and Aileen get into an argument which she intensifies by taking recriminol.

This book is excellent at describing the infamous British White Paper of 1939 and its effect on world Jewry, as well as the postwar fight to get rid of the White Paper by establishing a Jewish state.<br /><br />Just to give one example of the care Dolan shows, consider the fact that a young Jewish woman warned the British, French, and city newspaper of the impending bombing of the King David Hotel (the British failed to respond to her warning and 91 people died).  Most historians merely mention that an anonymous woman made these phone calls.  Not Dolan, who identifies her as Adina Nisan.<br /><br />Dolan is good at noting one of the most important aspects of the conflict, namely the enormous amount of misinformation.  He shows that many journalists gave reports that happened to correspond to what various Arabs wanted them to say.  He quotes Tom Friedman as explaining that many journalists are physically intimidated in the region.  And how violence in Israel makes the headlines: thousands can be killed in China without anyone noting it while three deaths in Israel get such heavy coverage that it appears as though the entire region is on fire.<br /><br />In addition, he mentions that even the language used to describe the region is biased.  Terms such as \\"occupied territory\\" (rather than \\"disputed territory\\") provide a good example of this.<br /><br />Dolan takes the time to chastise those who judge an Israel at war by the standards of a Western democracy at peace.  As he puts it, \\"I am frankly amazed that the perennially despised Jews, facing not only stones and firebombs, but real threats of annihilation from Arab neighbors (by a gas attack no less) have not reacted more harshly than they have.\\"  He quotes the Hamas Charter to give us an idea of what Israel is up against today.<br /><br />One more thing Dolan takes the time to do is briefly trace the history of Christian antisemitism, a \\"legacy of hatred\\" as he puts it.  He points out that while many Christians are relatively unaware of this history, most Jews are acutely aware of it.<br /><br />Finally, there is a short but useful list of references.  This is the book that made me aware of the excellent work by Arieh Avneri, \\"The Claim of Dispossession.\\"  I highly recommend both that book and this one.legacy of hatred\\" as he puts it.

Does it compare with London, Paris, or Honolulu?  Well, whether it does or not, here is an excellent book about Jerusalem in the twentieth century.<br /><br />The book opens describing a city of about 70,000 people (45,000 of them Jews).  And I found it interesting that the Jewish percentage of the city did not change all that much during the century, even though there were all sorts of political changes: World War One, the British Mandate, World War Two, Israeli independence, and the reunification of the city.<br /><br />Some of the stories are fascinating, such as how on December 17, 1902, during a severe drought, Muslim authorities permitted Jews to pray for rain at the Tomb of David.  Within hours, there was a huge rainstorm.<br /><br />There's plenty of interesting historical material as well.  We find about about King and Crane, and their report (they said that Jews ought not be given guardianship over Christian or Muslim holy places).  We learn about the riots of April, 1920, in which Arab mobs attacked Jews, explaining that the Jews were their dogs.  And we see how everyone fared in the period prior to World War Two, and how more Arab violence led to the scuttling of the Peel Plan to create a small Jewish refuge in the region to which European Jews could have fled.  And how that violence then led to the infamous British White Paper of 1939, which very severely limited Jewish immigration.<br /><br />One of the best parts of the book is the comparison between the Jewish and Arab parts of the city from 1948 to 1967, when the city was divided.<br /><br />Probably the weakest part of the book is at the end, where there is some mention of attempts to achieve peace between Arabs and Jews in the city.  I think no one has the perspective to discuss this very well right now.  Those who boast of compromising words and predict that peace may be in the offing are taking a serious stand.  And that stand, while it may have been tossed out casually, has been disproven by events.  Most of the talk about peace from known Arab terrorists has been insincere.  Nor has this insincerity been a surprise to most historians.  I think Gilbert would have been better off to simply admit that there has been recent violence and recent peace proposals.  And that it is possible that in the future, we'll all see that some of the violence was historically very significant, or that some of the peace proposals were actually significant.  But that now, it is too early to say anything of the sort.  And that would have been a good way to avoid overdramatizing any of the most recent happenings in the city.<br /><br />Still, this is an excellent book, and I strongly recommend it.ts.

It first appeared in 1950.  And now it is back fifty years later in a fourth edition.  In the meantime, the original two authors have passed away.  However, Coppens and Sanders have done a fine job in keeping the book up-to-date.<br /><br />Plenty of exercises have been added, and answers to many odd-numbered problems are in the back of the book.  I think it is an excellent introduction to the field (yes, I expect you to have studied calculus and differential equations as an underclassman).  It's my favorite of the classic engineering acoustics textbooks.<br /><br />Two new chapters have been added in this edition, one on nonlinear acoustics and the other on shock waves.  That's a very good idea.  If I were teaching an acoustics class with an earlier edition of the book, I'd refer students to Landau Volume 6 (Fluid Mechanics) to get some of this missing information.<br /><br />Actually, I wish the authors had added a couple more chapters, one on ultrasonics and another on instruments of music.  That still would not cover all of acoustics, but I feel these topics are fairly important.<br /><br />Anyway, I really like the book, and I'd be happy to teach a class using it.	2004-12-06

It begins with an overview of the advances of Muslim armies into Europe and explains that Western voyages of discovery soon led to the West surpassing the Muslim world economically and then militarily.  And we see that in the century prior to the end of World War One, the Muslims were in steady retreat against Europeans.  Lewis shows how in Western eyes, the Ottoman Empire went from being regarded as wicked and threatening to being mysterious but weak.<br /><br />That brings up the issue of how Muslims live under non-Muslim rule.  And we discover that the major issue is simply whether or not Muslims are free to practice their way of life.<br /><br />Lewis then brings up the issue of translating Arabic terms.  In most cases, translations are not a big problem.  But there are some concepts which are not really the same in Arabic as they are in Western languages, such as \\"state,\\" \\"freedom,\\" \\"democracy,\\" or \\"revolution.\\"  The author shows how the meaning of these words relates to Muslim behavior when Muslims have Western allies in wartime.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting section is the one on Orientalism.  Here, the author describes the frightful politicization of Middle East studies.  Lewis shows how politics, generally antizionist politics, has often substituted for scholarship in this field.  In my opinion, this understates the problem.  The academic world has to maintain standards to be of value.  If these standards are abandoned in one part of history, that will bring down the esteem and value of the entire discipline.<br /><br />This is a very informative book, and it's easy to read.  I highly recommend it.	2004-12-05

The ones by Israel's foes generally contain a surprising amount of misinformation.  And that may be why books such as this one do not.  Katz finds it easiest to support Israel by refuting antizionist lies, and he does so by telling the truth.<br /><br />Katz traces the origins of the Arab war against Israel.  That means supplying background material on the Jews of the Levant prior to modern Zionism.  That helps us all realize that Jews had an important connection to and presence in the Levant during the many centuries between the defeats by the Romans and World War One.  And it makes it clear that Jerusalem was not an Arab city in the latter quarter of the nineteenth century but virtually the only Asian city with a Jewish majority.<br /><br />The book exposes many antizionist fabrications about the history of the region.  Sometimes, antizionists tell us that Jerusalem is a holy city for the Arabs.  But the author shows us that Jerusalem has been important to the Arabs only recently, when the Jews have ruled it.  It is important now, because it is the Jewish capital, and because it would give the Arabs more esteem were they to deny the Jews their own capital city.<br /><br />The author also goes into some detail about the role of Great Britain in the history of the region from the end of World War One until Israeli independence.  He mentions the revelations of Richard Crossman about the intentions of Britain's foreign minister, Ernest Bevin, to destroy the Jews of the region rather than act as an honest broker between the Jews and Arabs.  And Katz shows how Britain acted as an active participant in the confrontation, with the explicit purpose of preventing the establishment of a Jewish state by force.  That includes the infamous White Paper of 1939, which drastically limited Jewish immigration to the region just when it was most needed for those attempting to avoid death at the hands of the Germans.<br /><br />I think Katz is at his best in discussing a very prevalent lie we all see today, namely that Arabs have at least as much of a right to steal Israeli land as the Israelis do to keep it.  And that the reason is that there is an Arabic-speaking subpeople that can live only on Israeli land.<br /><br />We've seen this argument before.  When Germans wanted to occupy Czechoslovakia in the 1930s, they pretended to do so on behalf of the German-speaking \\"Sudeten\\" people.  These were Germans who happened to live in Czechoslovakia.  But there was no symmetry between the desire of Czechs to enjoy human rights, protected by their government, and the desire of many Germans to deny human rights to the Czechs.  And once the Germans obtained Czechoslovakia, the pretense of a Sudeten people was abandoned.<br /><br />The author makes us aware of a similar problem today.  While antizionists may imply that there is a huge Arab population that can live only on Jewish land, that's simply not the case.  Katz explains that when Arabs controlled the entire West Bank from 1948 through 1967, not even allowing Jews to live there at all, there were no demands for a separate Arab state there.  And he makes us realize that even an Arab victory against the Jews of the region would not produce peace: the Arabs would continue to fight against each other for the spoils.  In addition, I think that since the Jews have not been the source of the problem, removing them will not solve it.<br /><br />The author quotes a few Arabs who feel there will not and should not be peace in the region as long as Israel continues to exist as a Jewish state.  And this is a major point.  Many people have the misimpression that since there are more Arabs than Jews, the Arabs have a right to oppress or destroy the Jews.  Or at least that history is on the side of the Arabs, who will get what they want whether they have a right to do so or not.<br /><br />But I think readers of this book will come away from it aware that Israel is a nation like any other.  And that it is land-poor, not land-rich.  In peacetime, Israel, like the Netherlands or the Czech Republic, simply will not be defeated.  To get rid of such nations, small as they are, would require a major crime.  Obliterating the human rights of the Czechs, Dutch, or Hebrews would be a crime as well.  Tacit approval of these crimes would set a very poor precedent for everyone, and thus such crimes are by no means inevitable.ome away from it aware that Israel is a nation like any other.

And unjust.  There are other books, such as Ezra Sohar's \\"A Concubine in the Middle East,\\" which explain that while the United States has given Israel some support, it has shown little concern for Israel's long-term well being.  Well!  Are both books wrong?  Are both books right?  Is the United States obviously doing something very, very right to annoy so many people on both sides?  (of course not).  Or is the United States simply being unfair to everyone?<br /><br />According to this book, the United States is supporting Israel and is wrong to do so.  But this book is not merely a political statement.  It also deals with objective reality, and by calling Israel a colonialist settler state and occupier of foreign land, it denies that reality.  And that can't be a good idea.  No matter what the author wants to do, he would be better off sticking to the truth.<br /><br />And there is one section where Aruri does have something to offer, namely those wonderful glossy color maps!  They're just great, and only a little misleading.<br /><br />Still, I can't see how propaganda is superior to honesty, no matter where one stands politically.  Suppose one wanted to destroy France and expel its inhabitants.  Would it help to believe that the French were really modern interlopers who had no genuine interest in the land nor any connection to it, and that given a little time, they would all pack up and go \\"home\\" to Antarctica?  No.  Now, France is a rather large nation, and it might be valid to believe that it needs to cede Bretagne or a few other areas to more local rule.  But would it be helpful to believe that the French are so weak and underpopulated that they would not have any land at all in a peaceful and just world?  Again, no.<br /><br />Israel is a small nation and in the long run, it may not be too important how it fares.  However, if enough people such as the author of this book have their way, it will set a precedent.  And that precedent is that might makes right.  That will encourage even the most good-hearted people to focus on getting the political strength to stay alive, rather than being helpful, honest, or just.  And that's not going to help human society or civilization.<br /><br />I can't see how this book will give anyone a better understanding of the Arab war against Israel.  At best, it serves as just one more of way too many examples of propaganda against human rights.thor of this book have their way, it will set a precedent.

They do plenty of self-promotion.  They make deals with a variety of thugs just to be permitted to operate in some regions.  In other cases, they make deals with various nations, adopting their political causes.  Worst of all, they can be misused by those with truly genocidal plans: they can be assigned to give food and lodging to intended victims, drawing them into camps.  When armies show up to murder the victims, the humanitarians obviously get out of the way.  But just what service does all this provide?<br /><br />While I found myself disagreeing with the author on plenty of occasions, I think he's written a good book.  He's clearly raised all the main issues with humanitarian aid.  These include questions of whether whether neutrality, impartiality, outright support for victims, or none of the above is the most effective way to help people.<br /><br />In the case of a genuine human rights organization, there's no doubt what the goal is.  The charters of such organizations are clear: they never are to support outright opponents of human rights politically.  Those charters are often violated, but at least we all know what they are supposed to do.  But in the case of humanitarian organizations, there are no such goals.  The idea is to provide day-to-day help to the needy, and being misused by people who intend to murder the needy may not even violate their charters.<br /><br />In any case, Rieff shows how humanitarian efforts failed in a most disheartening way in Bosnia and Rwanda.  And perhaps he's at his best when he explains how useless the United Nations has been in protecting anyone from aggressors.  He quotes one person as explaining that had the UN existed in the 1930s, all of Europe would now be speaking German.<br /><br />Rieff is pessimistic about the effectiveness of humanitarian aid in many areas.  And I have to agree with him about this.  Perhaps the worst aspect of it is that such failures, by giving humanitarianism a bad name, will encourage many people who truly want to help others to do something else instead.ps the worst aspect of it is that such failures, by giving humanitarianism a bad name, will encourage many people who truly want to help others to do something else instead.	2004-12-05

There are plenty of facts.  There's quite a bit of history.  But the author fails to use what he writes to derive reasonable conclusions.<br /><br />Leshem seems to think that Israel is very important, but that Jews are in trouble as a people.  And that everything will be better if only Israelis appease some thugs. But the author realizes that these thugs will probably murder as many Jewish Israelis as they can, if given the chance to do so.  Leshem even admits that if there is a mass slaughter of Jews in Israel, the Arabs will probably get away with it.  Given all this, the author's recommendation makes no sense.<br /><br />This book was written in 1989, and I think Israel had much better options than pretending that it could help resolve its disputes with Arab thugs by appeasing them.  We're now seeing the results of what happens when a nation takes the kind of advice Leshem offers.<br /><br />Israel had few allies in 1989.  And it wanted to maintain enough stability to permit Soviet Jews to immigrate.  However, it still could have tried to avoid having some foreign thugs arrive in its territory and force-feed antisemitic lies to a generation of Arabs.  In addition, it could have drawn a border and demanded its acceptance by the international community rather than simply give the impression that it would retreat indefinitely.  The author never considers such issues.<br /><br />Worse, the author never seems to worry about the Arabs.  The Arabs are the ones with a huge Empire, not the Jews.  Even if the Jews were to lose everything they have, they would not lose much land, because they have so little.  That's not the situation the Arabs are in.  If they lose their land, that will have huge ramifications for hundreds of millions of people or more.  I think Leshem ought to have spent a little time thinking about how to help the land-rich Arabs avoid risking what they have.<br /><br />The writer of this book was wrong, truly wrong, about how to deal with the Arab war against Israel.

And that means dealing with a couple of obvious potential forms of bias.  First, the people in a nation often delude themselves into thinking that they can salvage something useful out of bad situations just by making the smartest choices.  But that's not always the case: if one is outnumbered by hostile forces, one may lose a war no matter what one does.  The second problem is the opposite one, where people who lose a war may conclude that they have been mere bystanders to their own history, and that they had no opportunities to improve their circumstances.  Again, this is not always the case: one may get into a completely avoidable war and lose it.<br /><br />Did any of this happen in the Middle East?  The authors indicate that it did.  In doing so, they show the amount of Arab disunity.  This allowed small groups of fighters to appear to represent much larger populations.  In some cases, these small groups were granted vast land holdings.  In other cases, they simply got everyone in trouble by making any coherent unified policy impossible.  Meanwhile, Middle Eastern leaders were anything but hapless bystanders to history but active schemers who often overestimated their military position.  In addition, the discussion of the incredible mass slaughters of Armenians and Assyrians shows the extent to which Middle East despots misused their power.  The Karshes explain how the Middle Eastern Jews narrowly avoided suffering a similar fate.<br /><br />The authors make a number of very valuable points.  First, while many people blame wars on nationalism, the truth is that imperialism has been the problem.  The culprits have been those who demanded the right to subjugate others.  When their neighbors tried to assert their rights as human beings, empires used threats, followed by force, to punish those who failed to be properly subservient.  Second, Middle Eastern violence was not a European import.  The forerunner of modern Middle Eastern violence is neither European nationalism nor European imperialism but Middle Eastern imperialism.  Third, the interaction between Europeans and the Hashemites was not that of imperialists interacting with nationalists but of two imperialists interacting with each other, with the Hashemites demanding neither freedom nor self-determination but the rights to a successor Empire.<br /><br />This book supplies excellent background to those who wish to trace the origins of today's Middle East.as not a European import.

In response, She drew a circle next to me, a truly beautiful and perfect circle.  And right in front of my panicky brown eyes, She turned pi into four!

What would She do next, make me unwell by dropping the first letter from my first name?  i tried to apologize, but it was too late.\\"<br /><br />I was not the only one to dream of mangling pi.

435511:US	53071109	RGBRVVSZMOQ1T	0739102087	156195413	Poison	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Shows the nature and consequences of a political lie	I find big lies to be the most serious threat to peace on this planet.  Almost any conflict has a chance to be resolved, given that no matter how bad things are, fighting tends to make them worse.  Only when one or both sides are convinced that their opponents and neutrals are reacting to ad hoc fabrications are they likely to completely abandon a search for peace in favor of pure self-defense (or even aggression against the liars).<br /><br />That is why I find this book, which discusses a truly arbitrary fabrication, to be very important.  We may laugh at the accusations that were made against Israel in this case of \\"poisoning.\\"  But witch hunts are no joke.  And the threat to all of society is very serious, even though at first it may seem that only a few \\"witches\\" are being attacked.<br /><br />Raphael Israeli describes the case in a straightforward manner.  That makes this book very useful, because Big Lies will occur in the future.  And he implies that the same scenario will repeat: the bewilderment of the accused, the outrage of the accusers, the complicity of media and authorities, the indifference of neutrals, the claims that there really is no such thing as truth, and the generation of more lies and more escapades.<br /><br />The final third of the book is the best part.  In it, the author discusses what a lie is, what a hoax is, why people lie, what types of lies exist, and what political lies are.  He then gives a little of the history of antisemitic lies.  And he shows how these lies are used today to attack Israel's legitimacy.<br /><br />Perhaps if we all read more books like this one, we would not be so easily misled by liars and their media accomplices.	2004-12-04

But even though the words are diplomatic, it strongly criticizes the UN.<br /><br />As Gold explains, The UN was originally the idea of Franklin Roosevelt, who in 1944 pictured a foursome of the US, Great Britain, China, and the Soviet Union policing the world.  The idea then grew to include all other nations, both out of a proper sense of universality and a desire to avoid repeating the errors of the League of Nations.  And the UN started out with a unity of purpose and a sense of moral clarity.  It even passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights!<br /><br />But the UN's membership soon expanded to become dominated by authoritarian and totalitarian regimes.  And the author clearly shows that the UN now makes global chaos even worse by siding with aggressors.<br /><br />Gold shows where this trend began.  In 1948, the UN was given two tests: to protect India from a Pakistani invasion of Kashmir and to protect Israel from an Arab invasion.  It failed both tests, and it rewarded the aggressors.  And that set a precedent.  China invaded Tibet.  North Korea invaded South Korea (this did trigger a UN response, but only when the Soviets refused to use their veto).  The UN failed in the Congo, in Nigeria, North Borneo, Timor, and Hungary.  In 1962, the failures became clear when even India learned its lesson, and decided to resolve its dispute with Goa by military force.  And the author also tells about Arafat being allowed to come to the UN in 1974 and being applauded there.  I think this was a key moment, and that the UN has supported terror ever since.<br /><br />The author supplies some details about more recent UN misadventures, such as doing nothing to stop the murder of 800,000 Rwandans and allowing 7000 Bosnians to be murdered in UN \\"safe havens.\\"  And he explicitly lists the names of 46 terrorists who were students at UNRWA schools.<br /><br />Gold makes some interesting points about the International Criminal Court.  I hadn't realized that if a dictator were to slaughter minorities in his own nation, the ICC would have no jurisdiction, because the problem was national, not international.  The ICC would have no authority to act against the dictator even if the US sent in troops.  But it would have the authority to put the American troops and American leaders on trial for interfering!<br /><br />The author demonstrates that we actually saw something just as arbitrary when Belgian courts threatened to put Ariel Sharon on trial for allowing Arabs to be murdered at Sabra and Shatilla, even though Israeli troops did not do the killing and even though Sharon did not find out about the killings until they were over.  Meanwhile, Belgian troops serving as peacekeepers in Rwanda knew all about the Rwandan slaughters, which lasted for a hundred days, but no authority suggested putting any of them on trial.<br /><br />Well, what does Gold advise us to do now?  He suggests forming a coalition of democracies committed to common values and strategic purpose.  And he advises us to bypass the UN.  Even if the UN can be reformed, Gold says it will take a long time.  Until then, warns the author, the UN must not be empowered.  Yes, there are some democracies, such as France, that wish to \\"counterbalance\\" the US.  But he feels that even France, once removed from its UN role, where it is tempted to say \\"I veto, therefore I am,\\" might then improve its relations with the US.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it.ernational Criminal Court.

But it discusses an interesting topic: when did the Western Roman Empire really fall?<br /><br />Some people blame the collapse of the Western Roman Empire on the Goths.  Some blame it on the Huns.  Some on the fact that Romans had grown rich and lazy.  Some blame it on the Christians (actually, I agree with this theory to a large extent).  But Henri Pirenne blamed it on the Moslems.  And we see his argument for this in the present volume.  I think Pirenne wrote much of his material while in jail, and deprived of much of the reference material that he would surely have found useful.<br /><br />Obviously, Pirenne's thesis required Rome to last well past 476 AD, given that Mohammed was not born until long after that.  As the book explains, that raises four issues:<br /><br />1)  What developments distinguished Antiquity from the Middle Ages?<br /><br />2)  What impacts were there on the West of the German invasions and the Arab invasions?<br /><br />3)  Were the events of the 8th and 9th centuries basically a continuation of the previous 300 years or were they in sharp contrast to them?<br /><br />4)  What can we as historians say about trade in the West from 400 AD to 1000 AD?<br /><br />While Pirenne is blasted by several authors in this book, I think the above issues were worth raising.  And thus I think Pirenne did make a contribution to our knowledge of the history of that era, even though his ideas have been refuted.  As a matter of fact, I think the authors could have done a more convincing job of refuting Pirenne, but I doubt that many people will agree with me about this.<br /><br />The final two articles may be the most interesting.  In one, there is an analysis by a specialist in Islamic history, Daniel C. Dennett Jr.  In the final article, Anne Riising provides an overall summary of the evidence to date and the conclusions drawn from it.<br /><br />It was surprising how difficult it was for historians to agree on something as basic as the questions Pirenne raised.  And I shudder to think how difficult it would be to come up with anything useful had the issues been as politicized as many historical questions now are.agree on something as basic as the questions Pirenne raised.

It is easy to understand why.  As the author explains, liberals believe in a rational approach to political questions, individual freedom, progress, and cultural pluralism.  Jewish emancipation appeared to require liberalism.<br /><br />Wisse points out that there is a problem with all this.  Where were the liberals when Jews were slaughtered in World War Two?  And where are they now, when antizionists threaten them?  Just prior to World War Two, most people underestimated the destructive power of antisemitism.  Are we doing the same thing now?<br /><br />Wisse also points out the dilemma of many Jewish liberals.  In the past, Jews had to agree with many political views of non-Jews to fit more easily into society as a whole.  That's true today, as many Jews see support for Israel as politically incorrect.  So it makes sense that many Diaspora Jews refuse to support Israel: these Jews are trying to gain acceptance.  But Wisse reminds us that it won't work: antisemitism bears no relation to Jewish achievements or behavior.<br /><br />I think Wisse's best point is that it makes little sense for Jews to try to arouse sympathy by reminding people of the murder of the European Jews.  While it may be a good idea for non-Jews to know about this in order to try to avoid repeating it, it doesn't do Jews much good.  As the author explains, all it does is give people the impression that Jews are an easy target, that there must be something wrong with the Jews (or they would not have been picked as a target), and that it isn't a good idea to be a Jew.<br /><br />The author points out the significance of the massacres at Sabra and Shatilla.  The world reacted as if it were a major crime.  So major that it even wanted to blame Israel for its role.  But was it major?  Did they want to do anything about the actual murderers?<br /><br />Wisse discusses the Arab Big Lie.  She explains that this is \\"the attribution to one's target of one's intentions against it.\\"  That's why the Arab antizionists had no trouble equating Zionism and racism.<br /><br />The author concludes that the ultimate test of liberalism today is whether it will defend the Jews.  After all, joining those who blame Israel exacts almost no political price, and it sure is easier than standing up to the antizionists.<br /><br />Wisse thinks that many Jews would benefit by some serious soul-searching.  And that if they did, they would have to confess to something.  Not a false confession to Arab crimes.  But a real one to their own idealism and their readiness to sacrifice other Jews in their attempts to be accepted by non-Jews.<br /><br />Edward Alexander has a little test for liberals: do you demand for yourselves the same rights that you demand for others?  I think Wisse passes this test.s \\"the attribution to one's target of one's intentions against it.\\"  That's why the Arab antizionists had no trouble equating Zionism and racism.   <br /> <br />The author concludes that the ultimate test of liberalism today is whether it will defend the Jews.

Gamma-ray bursters were first detected in 1967, by satellites designed to verify complaince with rules against testing of nuclear weapons.  This book traces the history of figuring out what produced the gamma-ray bursts and tells what we know about them.<br /><br />The first question was: were they near us or far from us?  That got answered more than ten years ago: they're far away.  Besides the gamma-ray bursters, there were other objects, \\"soft gamma repeaters.\\"  We learn how all these phenomena started to become associated with faraway neutron stars.  The soft gamma repeaters were interpreted either as a release of magnetic energy by the neutron star or as the sudden accretion of matter by the neutron star.  And the gamma-ray bursters were interpreted as the, um, collision of binary neutron stars.  Actually, I think there is good evidence for some gamma-ray bursters being collapsars rather than merging binary neutron stars, and I wish there had been a better discussion of all this.  In addition, I would have liked to see more about the difference between the shorter and longer gamma-ray bursts.<br /><br />In any case, we're led to a couple of obvious questions: just how big are these bursts?  And how much damage would one do if it occurred in our galaxy?  Well, they can dish out up to 10 to the 52 ergs per second.  And they do that for about a minute.  For reference, our Sun puts out about 4 times 10 to the 33 ergs per second.  So for a minute, the gamma-ray burster is more than 10 to the 18 times as luminous as the Sun.  Over a hundred thousand times as luminous as the entire Milky Way galaxy!  That's scary.  If a star 5 light years from us were to become a gamma-ray burster, the blast would hit us like an atom bomb going off less than 10 feet away.  We'd be vaporized.<br /><br />Still, gamma-ray bursters are rather infrequent.  We might do better if the burster were, say, 500 light years away.  Still, that would pretty much set half the planet on fire, not a very pleasant prospect.<br /><br />Supernovae are about 10,000 times more frequent than gamma-ray bursters.  But Katz explains that gamma-ray bursters may be more dangerous to us than supernovae.  After all, we might well survive a supernova blast at a distance of 20 light years.<br /><br />The good news the author gives us is that we might be able to predict when a gamma-ray burst would occur.  He speculates that we might even know the time to the minute (assuming the merging binary neutron star theory is correct and we can make use of it), and know it years in advance.  If that burst were a thousand light years away, what would we do?  Most of us would get to the side of the Earth away from the blast, and that would protect us.  And a few brave firemen would water down half the planet and hide out underground, and then try to put out all the fires!  I've no idea what we'd do about all the induced radioactivity.  Sounds like a marvellous science fiction story.<br /><br />Anyway, I liked the book.  I don't know why there isn't more popular interest in these fascinating gamma-ray bursts..

One is to teach the reader something about astrobiology.  The other is to be a text for a science course for college undergraduates (in most cases, underclassmen majoring in something other than science).   <br /> <br />The book begins by discussing how stars and planets are formed.  And then comes a major point: biology may be common in the universe given evidence that organic molecules form fairly easily, life appears to have originated early in the Earth's history, and there's evidence that Earth life can survive under a wide range of conditions. <br /> <br />Next, there's a section on the nature of science and the scientific method.  And then some material on the definition and nature of life.  From there we go to the Earth's geological record.  And there's a useful discussion of greenhouse gases, possible high surface temperatures on Earth when life first developed, and a possible \\"Snowball Earth\\" much later. <br /> <br />Now comes a key chapter: how did life get started?  And when.  The text shows that it was not all that long after the Earth emerged from forming and being heavily bombarded.  And that hyperthermophiles may well have been the common ancestor of life on Earth today.  The book speculates that the process was: synthesis of organic precursor molecules, development of replicators (RNA), development of protocells (enclosing membranes), primitive cells (the RNA world), and then DNA-based cells.  It also addresses the question of whether life could have migrated to Earth from Mars or elsewhere.  There's a discussion of the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere.  And how primitive life evolved into the intelligent life that now exists. <br /> <br />These are certainly the right topics to start with.  But I wish this book, even with the constraint of being for non-science majors, had gone into just a little more detail on all of them.  It does just that on the rest of the topics. <br /> <br />The book continues with an excellent section about possibilities of life elsewhere in our planetary system, including the environmental requirements.  We look at Mars (including evidence from Martian meteorites), Jovian moons, and Titan.  And we see why Venus is too close to the Sun to be in the \\"habitable zone.\\"   <br /> <br />After that, there is a discussion of extrasolar planets and the serach for extraterrestrial intelligence.  If anything, there is an excess of material here, including speculations about the possible technology levels of an intelligent society and interstellar travel.  But this does lead to a worthwhile discussion of the Fermi paradox: if there are relatively nearby extraterrestrials, why aren't they here by now?   <br /> <br />Writing an overview of this field for non-science majors is a daunting task, and I think the authors did a really good job.  After reading such a book, I think one will find it much easier to understand any advances made in this field in the future.	2004-12-02

One benefit is that we can be sure it hasn't been influenced by more recent events!<br /><br />Pipes points out that he writes as an historian, placing events in their larger historical context.  And that there are two main factors that make this perspective worthwhile.  First, there is the feeling that things today are going poorly, which leads to a fascination with the past.  Second is the unsettled politics which make recent events hard to explain unless one can put them in a larger context.<br /><br />There's an essay about the risks of supporting fundamentalist Muslims against communism, something we all should have taken more seriously.  There's an article comparing Jewish and Muslim life, and pointing out that in both religions, people are becoming less observant of traditions, and that as a result, there has been more emphasis on faith in both religions, making them both a little more like Christianity in that respect.  There's another fine essay about the roots of Muslim antisemitism and Western receptivity to it.  And some interesting material about the Muslims of Central Asia (my ancestors!) as part of the then Soviet Empire.  We also get to read about the origins of the Iraq-Iran war.<br /><br />We discover how oil-rich Saudi Arabia and Kuwait treat foreign workers (mostly Muslim Arabs themselves).  And there is a (pre-invasion) analysis of Kuwait in particular: it has become very rich from its oil.  What will it do with all that wealth?  Anything useful?<br /><br />We all know that many Arabs want to get rid of Israel.  Pipes asks what they want to replace it by.  A bigger Syria?  A bigger Jordan?  A Pan-Arab nation?  A local Arab tyrant?  A fundamentalist state?  A nation of local residents?  And he asks why Arafat was always so unsuccessful militarily.  Most folks who keep losing battles either start winning or get replaced.  Why was Arafat so successful at getting support even though he never accomplished anything of value to anyone in the region?  Pipes explains that Arafat's support came from Arab states, not from local Arabs.<br /><br />There's an article on suicide terrorism, \\"the new scourge,\\" which also ought to have been taken more seriously fifteen years ago.<br /><br />An excellent essay deals with the way President Carter mishandled the Iran hostage situation.  Objectively, Carter did a terrible job here, allowing American foreign policy to be determined \\"on the interests of a handful of individuals.\\"  Pipes predicted that this could set a precedent for more American helplessness when confronted by terrorists.<br /><br />Three of the more interesting articles deal with the United States and the Middle East.  The author points out that the debate between American pro-Israeli and anti-Israeli camps crosses party lines.  One can be liberal or conservative and support either side.  The pro-Israeli side sees the Arab conflict with Israel as a symptom of Arab instability.  It recommends Arab reform and says that were Israel to vanish, all the Arab problems would remain.  The anti-Israeli side sees the Arab conflict with Israel as a cause of Arab instability.  It blames Israel for all the problems between the Arabs and the West and recommends doing something about Israel.  It says that were Israel to vanish, we'd all live in peace together, our problems gone.  Pipes explains that the fact that people on both sides are taking similar positions gives the United States a unique opportunity to help resolve the conflict.  And he then gets into the question of the extent to which American Presidents determine our Middle East policy (it's to a significant extent).  And how our record in that region isn't too good: we've come up with a big bunch of plans for resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict and none have gotten off the ground (by the way, in the ensuing fifteen years, we've come up with many more plans and we're no closer).<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting essay is near the end of the book, on the media and the Middle East.  As Pipes shows, the media do not merely report the news here, they create a fair amount of it.  And he quite properly says that the preoccupation on Israel and on Arafat certainly gave us all a very narrow and misleading view of the region.  It made Israel appear far more important than it is in real life.  And I think it made Arafat appear to be something like the most important person who ever lived.  While one can make a hero out of anyone (consider Horst Wessel), it isn't always useful to do so.<br /><br />Yes, this book is still worth reading, in spite of all the wild happenings and misadventures that have gone on in the region in the past fifteen years.ps the most interesting essay is near the end of the book, on the media and the Middle East.

And in the nineteenth century, Jacob Steiner almost proved it.  He proved that if there is a figure which has a greater area than any other figure with the same perimeter, then it must be a circle. And this book shows how.  I think Steiner's proof should be shown to students in any honors geometry course.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Steiner only proved that if there was an answer, it had to be the circle.  He never proved that there was an answer.  And when this was pointed out to him, he thought this was not a serious objection.<br /><br />And yes, Karl Weierstrass did spot the error in Steiner's proof, and he found a way to prove that there is an answer to the problem, finally solving a problem that had plagued mathematicians for so many centuries.<br /><br />If you are going to take a class in honors geometry in high school, and if my review hasn't talked you out of doing so, get this book.  You'll enjoy it.	2004-12-01

Not completely new: I've been reading astrobiology books since the 1960s.  But only recently have some fairly decent astrobiology textbooks been written that picture a core of topics needed to cover the subject.  These include the definition, nature, and origin of life; the development of life on Earth, the mass extinctions on Earth; possibilities of life elsewhere in the planetary system, possibilities for life to survive in outer space; changes to the Earth's environment brought about by life; the nature and evolution of consciousness and intelligent life; detection of extrasolar planets; and signatures of extraterrestrial life.  They also include some astronomy: formation of galaxies, habitable galaxies and habitable portions of galaxies, formation of stars and planets in these galaxies, migration of planets, statistics on deadly collisions of big objects with potentially life-bearing planets, and the significance of risks to life such as supernovae and gamma ray bursters.<br /><br />So far, no book is ideal in covering all these topics for upper division college students.  But I think this one comes closest.<br /><br />Since this book might be read by those who know plenty of astronomy but not much biology, or by those who know biology but not astronomy, the book begins with some needed background: fundamentals of physics, physical chemistry, and biochemistry.  It then gets into the question of how the elements we're made of were synthesized in the first place.  And it shows that our Universe is fairly well suited for life, even if not completely ideal.<br /><br />Then we get into an important topic, the thermodynamic foundations of life.  The book makes the point that one always has to be aware of the energetics of life: life needs energy, so where does that energy come from?  In addition, life requires a low entropy state.  Such states are not all that hard to come by, but one must know how one is achieved.  And life implies a high information content.  Again, one must know how to measure that content and decide where it has come from.  The author makes the point that given sufficient free energy, systems not in equilibrium will exhibit self-organizing and self-complexifying properties.  I found this fascinating.  It was almost as though the Purpose of Life were to reduce carbon dioxide, and life were merely a side-effect of catalyzing this reaction.<br /><br />Next there is a fascinating discussion of how life might have evolved.  Did we start with replicators, cell boundaries, substrates, or proteins, or a little of all of them?  Was there an \\"RNA world\\" before the \\"DNA world?\\"  And a \\"TNA\\" or \\"PNA\\" (peptide nucleic acid) world before that?  Can we have autocatalysis without replication?<br /><br />After that comes a discussion of extreme environments, given that life's last common ancestor may well have been an extremophile.  And then we learn about the faint early Sun, a carbon dioxide greenhouse effect on Earth, the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere, and a possible \\"snowball Earth.\\"  We read about possibilities of life elsewhere in our planetary system: Europa, Titan, and Mars.  And we find out about techniques for discovering extraterrestrial signatures of life.  There's a very good and up-to-date section on extrasolar planets.<br /><br />The textbook ends with a little material on the nature of self-awareness and on future prospects for the human species and civilization.  I think it is an excellent text.mation content.  Again, one must know how to measure that content and decide where it has come from.

The writing is clear and concise.  The book is packed with information.<br /><br />This book is for those who want to do physics, and it teaches one to do physics the way physicists do it.  It is the second volume in L&L's Course on Theoretical Physics;  it follows the volume on Mechanics.  And the next logical topic is relativity.  So this book starts out with special relativity, four-vectors, relativistic mechanics, and particle decay and scattering.<br /><br />But then we proceed to what I think really needs to come next, namely a discussion of electromagnetic fields.  We derive Maxwell's equations.  We learn a little about optics.  And then we get to the field of moving charges, and radiation of electromagnetic waves.  These are very important topics.  If I were teaching a class on relativity, I'd make good use of these two chapters.  I think it is very instructive to learn about the field of an accelerating charge.<br /><br />The sections on general relativity are especially well written.  And we learn how to work all sorts of general relativity problems, such as finding the radiated energy and angular momentum loss for a system of two bodies moving in elliptical orbits.  The icing on the cake is a short chapter on cosmology.<br /><br />This is the way to learn physics.	2004-11-30

Actually, I prefer Landau's book.  But Landau's book is about 170 pages and this one is about 650 pages.<br /><br />And you get much more material with this book.  The book is readable, and there are plenty of useful exercises.  You start off with Lagrange's equations.  Then you learn a little about the calculus of variations.  And then the central force problem, kinematics of rigid body motion, and oscillations.  And there's material on Hamilton's equations, canonical transformations, and Hamilton-Jacobi theory.  In this manner, the text covers in 420 pages what Landau does in 170.  There are more explanations and more examples.  It's not a bad way to learn the subject.<br /><br />In addition, there are chapters on special relativity, chaos, canonical perturbation theory, and continuous systems and fields.  These are good topics to cover in a upper division class on mechanics.  This book has a lot to offer a student and would be fun to teach from.	2004-11-30

Anyway, if you've ever been on a boat, this is a story for you.<br /><br />And if you've ever heard of St. Pierre and Miquelon, you may wonder just what those islands are good for.  In this book we find out.  You use them to smuggle alcohol!  When you get caught, you just throw the stuff overboard, weighed down by bags of salt.  The salt takes half a day to a day to dissolve, and then the loot surfaces and can be picked up.  But by whom?  By you or by the authorities?  We find that out as well!<br /><br />This sure was fun to read.	2004-11-30

Why then am I giving it so much praise?  And a five star rating?  Well, read on.<br /><br />As some of the earlier reviewers have already explained, the facts in this book are well documented.  And, most important, the facts about the population and land purchase in the region for the past couple of centuries will shock plenty of people.<br /><br />That's the key.  Why is it that very dull facts about the population of a region are found surprising and even shocking by many people?  Why would they care about such stuff, let alone have learned incorrect information about it?  The reason is that some Arab antisemites, abetted by some antizionist propagandists, have come up with some incredible and absurd fabrications about Jewish and Arab settlement in the Middle East.<br /><br />This book shows the increase in Jewish and Arab populations in the Levant.  It shows how Arabs moved to areas with high Jewish populations, presumably for economic reasons.<br /><br />But the most strikingly false claim that this book refutes is that unarmed Jews somehow wandered into the Levant from 1878 to 1948 in order to steal land from helpless, heavily armed Arabs.  The book spends a great deal of time showing how the Jews actually purchased land, dunam by dunam, at high prices.  And it explicitly names fifty major Arab nationalists, public figures, who sold significant amounts of land to the Jews.<br /><br />These are some of the reasons why this book has become essential in understanding the Arab-Israeli conflict.  It should have been irrelevant and unimportant.  But now it has to be regarded as significant that in a world where so many books are filled to the brim with fabrications, there are a few, including this one, that tell the simple and boring truth.	2004-11-29
441079:US	53071109	RHMJDLJLZJ55I	088400189X	47670438	To Right A Wrong: The Revocation of UN General Assembly Resolution 3379 Defaming Zionism	Books	5	2	2	N	N	An interesting story	Let's put this in perspective.  The United Nations, from 1948 through 1974, had plenty of ups and downs.  It fought against smallpox.  It supported Planned Parenthood.  But its peacekeeping forces were a disaster, and it failed to help in one international dispute after another.<br /><br />In 1974, things took a big turn for the worse, as Arafat, the world's most notorious terrorist, was invited to speak at the United Nations.  Rather than being arrested and executed, he was applauded there!  After that, things went further downhill.  As this book explains, in 1975, there was a campaign to vilify a member state, Israel, by calling Zionism names.  One name that was chosen that year was \\"racism.\\"  In June, that word was included in the language at the UN conference on Women in Mexico City.  And in November, the General Assembly passed a resolution calling Zionism a form of racism.<br /><br />Well, what was to be done?<br /><br />The author of this book wanted to get that resolution repealed.  I sure wouldn't have.  I would have recommended outlawing the UN on the spot and arresting anyone working for it.  But I guess Manor is more of a diplomat than I am.<br /><br />Although I certainly disagree strongly with Manor's political views, I think this is an excellent book.  He describes the infamous Zionism = racism resolution.  He describes how it passed.  And he tells about the damage it caused.<br /><br />This is actually a major point that Manor is to be highly praised for making.  Namely that the harsh criticism the resolution received got many people to overlook how damaging it has been to the UN, to Israel, and to Mankind in general.  In fact, this resolution demoralized those who supported human rights, Israel, truth, justice, Zionism, international cooperation, or diplomacy.  It made dialog more difficult between people who disagreed about how to resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute.  And it gave antisemitism a new legitimacy.<br /><br />Consider the damage there was to the Roman Senate when Caligula added a horse to its membership.  And that damaged Rome as well.  It helped no one to have the UN damaged in such a manner, least of all Israel.<br /><br />The book then gets into the campaign to rescind the infamous resolution.  What I found enlightening was that even in 1990, when Australia sounded out 22 nations about it, none seemed ready to switch their votes.<br /><br />Finally, the resolution was indeed rescinded at the end of 1991.  But it took Soviet support to do that.<br /><br />This book was written prior to the infamous Durban conference of 2001, in which we saw that the resolution, not its rescinding, stands out as the more relevant event.  And unlike the author, I think it casts into doubt the policy of trying to reform an organization that could pass such an absurd and harmful resolution in the first place.he damage there was to the Roman Senate when Caligula added a horse to its membership.

It shows that for some people, there is a concept of \\"the City\\" as being evil.  It asks where that concept came from.  It asks what the foes of the Occidental city do to their own cities, and if they simply create brutal copies of them.  And it addresses the issue of suicide attackers of the West.  It tries to trace the recent history of cases where large groups of people willingly gave up their lives not to defend the lives and property of their countrymen but to destroy the lives and property of others.  It asks what role religious intolerance plays in Oriental hatred of the Occident.<br /><br />Moreover, the book tries to assess the Oriental point of view honestly, rather than simply apologize for it.  That's a very good idea.<br /><br />Normally, I simply give any book that can do all that five stars.  But I'm giving this one only one star.  And that is because the authors make a point which I disagree with very strongly.  At first, I thought that maybe I merely have a political disagreement with the authors.  I wouldn't want to tell people that a book is no good just because some people disagree with the politics of one of its statements!<br /><br />But the problem I have is not political.  I think what the authors are saying on the following issue is objectively false and misleading.<br /><br />Here's the problem.  The authors discuss Herzl and Zionism and Herzl's book, \\"Alteneuland.\\"  And they see its ideas as a problem.  That Zionist Jews felt they could buy love with money.<br /><br />But this implies that the Jews did something dubious in acquiring land and felt that their money would make things all right.  And that is objectively untrue.  The Jews bought land at high prices.  Not surprisingly, many of them made good use of it.  That's an example of human beings at their best.  Some of their opponents decided to kill the Jews and steal the land.  And, more importantly, trash that land.  That's an example of human beings at their worst.<br /><br />The issue isn't buying \\"the gratitude of lesser breeds.\\"  It is improving the quality of life for the entire community.  And the Jews succeeded.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I have to wonder about which side the authors wanted to imply were considered \\"lesser breeds.\\"  Suppose the authors had said such nonsense about Blacks in the South (and topped it by hinting that \\"poor White trash\\" were \\"lesser breeds\\").  Suppose they had said that the Blacks, who had earlier been enslaved by the Whites, were \\"naively\\" buying land with some of the money they were now earning.  And that they were producing goods on that land, and that Whites were eager to buy those goods.  Would the authors then blame the Blacks for doing all this?  If so, everyone would be right to call the authors racists.  More important, the authors would be saying something that is simply false, not just political.<br /><br />In this case, the Jews didn't steal land or oppress their neighbors, much less try to get away with misdeeds by giving money to their victims.  Instead, the Jews set a moral example for all of humanity, and the authors are simply criticizing people for being good.  And that is not an accurate or useful way to evaluate Oriental attitudes towards the West.an example of human beings at their worst.   <br /> <br />The issue isn't buying \\"the gratitude of lesser breeds.\\"  It is improving the quality of life for the entire community.

Or perhaps someone a bit older who never took much mathematics.  This book really does not require much (if any) math.<br /><br />That might be good.  Such a person might want to know about elementary particles.  They're fascinating.  And they are the building blocks of matter.<br /><br />The book starts with an explanation of what particles are, a little history of particle physics, and (here's what a high school student might want to know) some description of what it is like to become a particle physicist: you go to college, you go to graduate school, you become a post-doc, you stay at a university, where you work on experiments or do theory, or maybe you just give up and get a job on Wall Street.<br /><br />Then there is a description of the standard model, with the quantum numbers for the particles we know about.  The Higgs boson is added to the list, even though it has not been discovered.  And there is a discussion of high energy experiments, and plenty about that Higgs boson.<br /><br />And there's material about supersymmetry and a little about cosmology.<br /><br />There are a couple of appendices.  One has a few pages on Feynman diagrams.  Okay, that may confuse some readers but it is just an appendix.  I'd leave it in.  Another mentions internal symmetries.  Here, I think some diagrams showing a few SU(3) multiplets wouldn't have hurt, but I guess Kane figured that telling about the families of leptons and quarks was enough.<br /><br />In short, it is a good choice for the audience I mentioned.  I just wish it had a little more in it.  What's there gives a reader a good idea about why some folks find so much beauty and fascination in this field.	2004-11-28

If there's no telltale clicking (called \\"talking\\") when you snuck that coin into the hand with another coin in it, well, you'll be surprised how many people fall for it.<br /><br />Sure, if they are watching carefully when you, say, palm a card from a deck, they'll see it.  But this book aims to teach you how to get them distracted so they won't watch carefully.<br /><br />Maybe the most fun was the last couple of dozen pages, about stage illusions.  Hay explains the trick of sawing a woman in two.  \\"Obviously, however, you have to use two girls - not one to saw up and one to restore, but one for the head and one for the feet.\\"  And if you happen to be the \\"head\\" girl, remember to roll your head from side to side with each stroke of that saw.	2004-11-28

And Timmerman shows why.  First, France had been very supportive of us in the 1980s, when the fight was against Soviet power.  Second, there had been some very strong private assurances from the French President to the United States a few months earlier that France would go along with us on the Iraq issue: these were clear and somewhat surprising lies.  Third, although France was not part of NATO's unified military command, there was plenty of French cooperation with the United States, both military and commercial.  A failure to support the United States against Iraq might risk losing plenty of money and support from our side.  And going beyond that to do what France actually did, rallying world leaders against the United States, was even riskier.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, France went beyond even that when ten former Soviet-bloc nations warned Iraq that it was risking war by failing to cooperate with UN disarmament inspectors.  The French President informed those nations that they \\"missed a great opportunity to shut up,\\" and informed them that their stand on Iraq would not be forgotten when they tried to apply for membership in the European Union!<br /><br />This book gives plenty of background information about French relations with both the United States and Iraq.  It shows how French support of Saddam Hussein made it more difficult for the United States to formulate a coherent policy regarding Iraq: it appeared to many of us that France and Iraq were teammates in trying to hide weapons from inspectors.  And it asks why France was willing \\"to cast aside the 225-year old alliance with America in favor of a tinpot dictator\\" (Saddam Hussein).  The answers include money, oil, and a search for prestige.  France was a major supplier of weaponry to Saddam Hussein, and the extent of this support became clearer after Baghdad fell.<br /><br />Timmerman believes that France and the United States can patch up their differences.  But I think it is worth reading this book to discover how frayed the relations between America and France have become.lier of weaponry to Saddam Hussein, and the extent of this support became clearer after Baghdad fell. <br /> <br />Timmerman believes that France and the United States can patch up their differences.

We see how attorneys routinely destroy honest witnesses on the stand, in total violation of professional ethics.  We see attorneys hide evidence and doctor documents.  We see\\"expert\\" witnesses say whatever the attorneys tell them to say.  We see police say whatever the procedures imply would be the best testimony to give, accurate or not.  And we see some juries intentionally give unjust verdicts, without any fear of reprisals for wrongdoing.<br /><br />Katz's first target is the exclusionary rule.  This rule is intended to keep evidence out of the courtroom if the cops seize it illegally.  Well, it is all well and good to deter police misconduct, this rule is not part of our constitutional rights.  All it accomplishes is to make truth irrelevant in criminal proceedings.  It has to go, and our rights have to stay.<br /><br />The same goes for the \\"Miranda\\" rule, which once again gets truth out of the courtroom.  Since truth is a prerequisite for justice, this has to be counterproductive.<br /><br />Removing these rules would decrease the number of lies told by police on the witness stand to avoid having otherwise legitimate cases thrown out.  And these lies are deadly to the system: they cause everyone to lose respect for justice, and at some crucial moments, good lawyers will catch the police telling such lies and get completely guilty defendants to go free, causing the justice system to look even worse.  Katz points out that police ought to be prosecuted for violating Fourth Amendment rights, and that criminals ought to go free only if the violations are \\"shocking to the conscience of a civilized society.\\"<br /><br />Katz next takes on juries, explaining that the Bushell case in 1670 is a precedent that has prevented jurors from being penalized for bad verdicts.  That has been a blessing in some cases, but has allowed juries to misbehave badly in others.  Katz has some ideas on how to improve matters.  It includes avoiding the large number of jury challenges, which can degenerate into a contest to see \\"who can pick the stupidest and most bigoted jury.\\"  In my opinion, juries ought not be trusted with determining truth at all and at best ought to decide what justice to apply given the truth.<br /><br />There is a marvellous chapter about witnesses, which includes the amazing examination of Mary Brunner by fellow Manson family murderer Bobby Beausoleil.  Katz points out that statements taken by the police ought to be videotaped.  As for difficult witnesses changing their stories under oath, Katz suggests exposing such witnesses to perjury charges.<br /><br />The author also recommends getting rid of \\"imperfect self-defense\\" and other abuse excuses such as \\"diminished capacity\\" and \\"temporary insanity.\\"  Even if there really were extenuating circumstances arising from something of this sort, the time to apply them would be at sentencing, not in determining guilt or innocence.<br /><br />Finally, there is a recommendation to have cameras in the courtroom.<br /><br />I think there are plenty of useful suggestions in this book, and I enjoyed reading it.has some ideas on how to improve matters.

It consists of plenty of anecdotal information about a wide variety of aspects of Israeli life.<br /><br />We see young adults, the army, and entrepreneurs.  We see divisions among Jews into Ashkenazim, Mizrahim, Russians, Africans, Haredim, Orthodox, and Non-Orthodox.  And we see the internal and external worries and problems they have.  More than that, we see their reaction to \\"the situation,\\" namely the war of annihilation being fought by extremist Arabs against the Jews of the region.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting part of the book is the description of non-Jewish Israelis: the Muslims, Bedouin, Druze, and Christians.  I was amazed by the tolerance shown by the Israeli public for outright disloyalty to Israel in time of war shown by many non-Jews.  I can't imagine acting so against a nation I happened to be visiting, let alone one I lived in and might even be a citizen of.  These sections convinced me that there won't be any peace in the region for a long time.<br /><br />One item I can't agree with is the subtitle: ordinary people in an extraordinary land.  In fact, while the people are much the same as people everywhere, the land is also much the same as land everywhere.  Israel is, after all, a small country that looms much larger than life due to the enormous amount of ink that is spent on it.  Still, given some of the more outrageous things we sometimes see written about Israel and Israeli society from Israel's detractors, this book is a very refreshing change indeed.	2004-11-26

Let's examine Hoyle's basic argument, which is behind the papers in this book.<br /><br />In one of the papers (\\"Deductions from the Weak Anthropic Principle\\"), Hoyle claims that the information content of a simple cell or, worse, of a complex organism, is so huge that it would be basically impossible for life to originate in a Big-Bang cosmology.  That would force us to return to one of Hoyle's favorite ideas, basically a steady-state universe.<br /><br />Let's not completely dismiss the idea of Hoyle's steady-state universe.  In spite of the convincing evidence for a Big Bang, there is the worry that we're being a little provincial by saying that all of Reality may be less than 15 billion years old.  There is the question: what else is there?  What was there \\"before\\" Reality?  And note that a universe that had an infinite number of consecutive \\"Big Bangs\\" might be \\"steady-state\\" in effect.  But I am still extremely unimpressed by Hoyle's argument.<br /><br />For one thing, I can't abide the argument that life has virtually no chance (1 in 10 to the tens of thousands or more) of arising in our Universe, a Universe which if anything seems ideal for the development of life.  The Universe is here.  We're here.  Why not believe that it is possible?  I for one would bet that it is.  And if that does not agree with Hoyle's theory, I'm perfectly prepared to believe that his theory is wrong.<br /><br />For another, I think Hoyle is completely wrong to say that the transition from non-living to living matter can't really proceed by a relatively small set of surprisingly likely steps.  Hoyle calls this a semantic argument, \\"which seeks to replace the probability for the whole chain by the sum of the individual probabilities of the many steps, instead of by the product.\\"  That statement by Hoyle is very insulting and totally incorrect.  In addition, Hoyle's conclusion is absurd.<br /><br />Finally, let's get to the meat of much of the book, namely discussions of life in space.  Perhaps the motivation for this was something like the following argument: Life could not have originated on Earth.  Therefore it must have originated on a planet just like Earth and moved here from there.<br /><br />I know I have stated this argument sarcastically.  But that does not mean that Hoyle can't be right about life on Earth coming from Mars or elsewhere.  I'd bet against it.  But it is possible.  For Hoyle's idea to have a chance, we'd want evidence that some logical steps in the origin of life simply did not happen on Earth, or had insufficient time to occur.  Then, find some evidence that there was indeed a more hospitable environment elsewhere, plus time for life to develop there, plus a good mechanism to get that life here, and we'd have a very legitimate scientific discussion on our hands.<br /><br />That is what leads to many of the papers in this book, which try to assess what organic polymers there are in space.  This fits in with questions about whether life can survive the space environment: no gravity, no atmosphere, cosmic rays and other radiation, little if any water, and extreme cold.  Plus the problems of getting into space and surviving a landing on Earth.  And especially the issue of whether life is out there right now.<br /><br />Hoyle and his co-authors discuss the nature of interstellar grains.  They find that there may be an enormous amount of bacteria out there, but this conclusion has not been supported by many others in the academic community.  I feel that the strength of the evidence for such claims is indeed exaggerated in this book.<br /><br />I found this book to be unsatisfying.

And it raises some interesting questions about the morality of this deed.<br /><br />Still, I'm deducting four stars from what would otherwise have been the rating I'd give it.  Why?  Because it overlooks the human rights aspects of the murder in favor of the religious ones.  It states up front that the Stern Gang was primarily driven by religious extremism, and not by a desire to promote simple human rights for human beings, including Jews.  And I think that is a very big mistake.<br /><br />Other than that, there's plenty of good stuff about who did what.  And even about how Bernadotte became so hated by almost all Israelis, even the most moderate and liberal ones.<br /><br />The moral question it raises is simple enough.  Suppose there is a person such as Bernadotte who threatens the lives and human rights of tens of thousands of people or more.  What can one do about it?  Suppose that one can't arrest him or her because to do so would start a war.  Suppose that person is a representative of a big nation, or of the United Nations?  The alternatives eventually come down to letting that person stay around, demanding her or his expulsion from your land, or murder.<br /><br />And that appears to be the question Israel was faced with.  Bernadotte was, as the author admits, considered to be a serious threat.  The following quote of Samuel Merlin from the book, sums it up.  The murder \\"was an incredible feat.  I was never an extremist, but this deed was more important than defeating a whole division of the British Army.  Israel was very frail then, and he proposed giving the Negev to the Arabs and demilitarizing Jerusalem and making it international, including the Jewish City.  Bernadotte was a danger to Israel.\\"<br /><br />Whether or not this was the intent, I think the book does show that Bernadotte wound up siding with Arab fascists and in effect endorsing Arab murders over Jewish self-defence.  But did this cause or justify the murder of Bernadotte?<br /><br />I think it did cause it.  The murder of Bernadotte was by no means inevitable.  After all, Arafat, a major terrorist, was not murdered.  But those who cause the deaths of huge numbers of people are not immune from violent attack.<br /><br />On the other hand, I see no way to justify such extrajudicial killings.  Bernadotte was unarmed.  He was unlikely to personally murder anyone.  In the long run, such killings set several bad precedents.  Among them are killings of all sorts of people on the basis of any excuses one might find.  In addition, there's the problem of making the cause of human rights, for which I think Bernadotte actually was killed, look suspect.  And they reduce one's flexibility in dealing with armed terrorists.  Perhaps one reason that Arafat was permitted to stay alive and do so much harm to our species was a reaction to the killing of Bernadotte.  Marton does not get into any of these issues, but I think she should have.<br /><br />This book made me think quite a bit.  It almost got that elusive second star from me.over Jewish self-defence.

But why?  Pipes begins by showing that while Islamic militants may comprise only ten per cent or so of the Islamic world, their effect is enormous.  When they take control of a nation, they create a rogue state, causing misery both at home and abroad.  They repress moderate Muslims and treat non-Muslims as inferior creatures.<br /><br />Pipes points out that Muslim demographics is not the issue: Muslim moderation is.  If Islamists win, we'll see much more violence and many more threats.  One recommendation is to allow Turkey, a moderate nation, to join the European Union.  And Pipes also explains that poverty and militant Islam are pretty much unrelated: improving the economic situation in a nation does not make it more moderate.<br /><br />The author discusses Islamist goals in the United States.  One key is going beyond acceptance of Islam and Muslim practices to restrict or disallow non-Muslim worship or customs.  Such goals distinguish militants from moderates.  And here is where Pipes suggests that our media could help, by distinguishing between the two.  Instead much of our media are reluctant to criticize the militants, fearing accusations of political incorrectness, bias, defamation, and Islamophobia.  Pipes points out that the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is a leader in the Islamist campaign to intimidate those who oppose the militants.  CAIR supports Hamas, so one of its biggest goals is to reduce the criticism of Hamas terror against Israel.  That raises the issue of the threat groups such as CAIR pose to American society by urging antisemitic violence.<br /><br />Pipes has some advice for us: avoid working with militant Islamic groups, don't appease or help Islamists, support those who confront the militants, press militant states to reduce their aggression, and urge gradual democritization.<br /><br />This is a useful and informative book.	2004-11-26

It left me wondering what kind of species could do such a thing to itself.  And it convinced me that the United Nations is not merely useless, but is an extremely counterproductive organization.<br /><br />But this book does not stop there.  It continues for well over 500 pages to describe United Nations legitimization of terror.  It describes the UN view of the terrorist as a martyr, and how it ruled against taking action against Ziad Abu Ain, who murdered two boys and injured 36 other people with a bomb.<br /><br />Schoenberg then shows how the terrorists have co-opted many UN elements and forums: the General Assembly, the Security Council, Secretariat, the specialized agencies, the peacekeeping agencies.  Here we see the extent to which anti-Israeli slanders have dominated the UN agenda, crowding out many real issues the UN ought to attend to.<br /><br />The author shows the flip side of the coin: in addition to lionizing terror, the UN undermines, delegitimizes, and defames both Israel and Jews in general.<br /><br />Still, there is an obvious question: what sort of precedent is this support for terror?  Is it part of a larger problem?  Here, the author discusses the concept of a \\"national liberation movement\\" (NLM).  He asks what an NLM is, and whether the anti-Israeli terrorists actually constitute one (they don't).  And he mentions the implications for supporting anything that calls itself an NLM.<br /><br />Schoenberg then discusses the history of the political left with Arab terrorism.  After all, until the mid-1960s, Arab antisemitic terror had been politically aligned with fascism.  That had been true of Mufti Amin al-Husayni.  And Israeli relations with Cuba had been good.  But in the late 1960s, the Soviet Union pressured Castro into siding against Israel.  This was a key step in obtaining support for genocidal antisemitism from the Left.<br /><br />I think the most interesting part of the book were the descriptions of how the UN supports and disseminates terrorist propaganda.  And how it gets some otherwise intelligent people to feel that negotiating with terrorist groups and supporting at least some of their warlike demands is a means to achieve peace.<br /><br />Schoenberg concludes by explaining that if the United Nations were to represent the decent opinion of Mankind, the smaller and weaker nations of the world would have a genuine forum.  However, it doesn't do that, and thus these smaller nations are losing an opportunity to have their views listened to seriously.<br /><br />This book was written 15 years ago, but it ought to be reprinted.

I read it when it first came out.  It had a big effect on me.  It may have changed me as a person more than any other book I have ever read.<br /><br />When I read it, I was a little surprised by the fact that Benny Morris had made an error that wound up with him saying that in 1938, David Ben-Gurion had said \\"We must expel Arabs and take their places.\\"  In fact, as Karsh pointed out, using the actual source would have confirmed a typo here: Ben-Gurion actually wrote, \\"We do not wish and do not need to expel Arabs and take their places.\\"<br /><br />Yes, that was a big mistake on Morris' part, not checking the original source.  And it was a big mistake to get something like this wrong.  But I still pondered about how Morris could write something so unusual without checking it.  After all, wasn't he aware of Ben-Gurion's other statements in the previous and following years?  Wasn't he aware of how far this would have been from the statements of most of Ben-Gurion's political allies and supporters?  Wasn't Morris aware of how insane it would have seemed to most Jews to prescribe a policy of war towards the much more numerous Arabs?<br /><br />What Karsh appeared to be telling me was that some extremely unlikely speculations had been presented as history.  It would be as if some historian quoted John Kennedy as President claiming that the Earth was flat in an important speech, after proposing that we send a person to the Moon.<br /><br />Karsh did a careful job of coming up with the actual history here.  And he then demolished Avi Shlaim's claim of \\"collusion across the Jordan.\\"  Here again, Karsh showed a situation in which a supposedly serious historian made a highly dubious claim and supported it with a single piece of highly disputable evidence.  And the story continues in the next chapter when we see Shlaim and Ilan Pappe's claims about Britain going along with this non-existent collusion, and saying that Bevin warned the Jordanians not to invade territory belonging to the Jews.  Here was another surprise: I had read Glubb's original claim that Bevin had said not to invade those areas.  Glubb said that Bevin said it twice!  And it seemed possible to me that Bevin could have said such a thing.  But was Glubb telling the truth?  Karsh, after carefully examining several records of what happened at that meeting, shows that Glubb was basically not telling the truth here.<br /><br />Another good job of investigation!<br /><br />But the biggest shock was saved for last.  I had not realized that Shlaim had said \\"Far from being 'the great ogre who unleashed Arab armies to strangle the Jewish state at birth,' Bevin 'emerges from the documents as the guardian angel of the infant state.'\\"<br /><br />I had read quite a bit about Bevin, and I immediately recognized Shlaim's claim as completely and transparently false.  It was like saying that the United States had fought in World War 2, but not telling the truth about which side we fought on: Germany's or the Soviet Union's.<br /><br />Had Shlaim really said something this bizarre?  He had.  And that was a huge revelation for me.  That we were not talking about a few mistakes by some \\"new historians.\\"  Nor even some very biased reading of a few documents to support some dubious ideas.<br /><br />As Karsh had said in his title, this was indeed \\"fabricating Israeli history.\\"  We were discussing outright violations of acceptable academic behavior.<br /><br />This book made me realize just how much some academics have opposed (not just abandoned) truth.  And I think this issue is far bigger than just the Arab-Israeli conflict.  At some point, for human society to function, there must be some respect for truth by our educational institutions.  In my opinion, that is what this book is all about.<br /><br />After reading this book, I no longer assumed that academic people would necessarily strive for truth.  And recently, I have read and reviewed quite a few books about the Arab-Israeli conflict.  I have given positive reviews to most of those which made serious attempts to tell the truth.  And I've given negative ones to books which simply attempted to mislead their readers.  I hope that in so doing, I am contributing, in my own small way, to improving human society.made serious attempts to tell the truth.

They include disappointment with the theological basis of monotheism, resentment at the actions of monotheists, and loyalty to one or more Goddesses and Gods or to their adherents.  And many Pagans simply want more options, more freedom, more flexibility, or even more privacy in their religious lives.  Much of the book deals with the organizational aspects of Paganism, and that's important.  But it also shows that one can be a Pagan without submitting to much in the way of human religious authority at all.<br /><br />This book contains interviews with about sixty Pagans.  We discover from them what some Pagan options are today, what Pagan organizations are like, how Pagans fit into the larger community, what Pagan beliefs, practices, and lifestyles are all about, and what directions Pagan groups are moving in.  It's worth reading whether you are a Pagan or not.	2004-11-24

And it raises the question of why anyone would want to buy it, just to be told lies.<br /><br />I simply don't understand why anyone would want to produce such stuff.<br /><br />After all, there are quite legitimate things one could say about what we were told in the leadup to the war against Iraq.  We all knew that Saddam Hussein had used poison gas against his own people.  We knew that there was a question about Iraq's progress towards obtaining nuclear weapons, or at least enough of a threat to preclude an attack.<br /><br />Can it be argued that the statements about the Iraqi nuclear weapons threat were false and that these statements caused us to reach a decision to go to war?  I think a case can be made for it.  But don't worry!  The authors of this book do no such thing.  They just say whatever nonsense pops into their heads and pretty much taunt their readers.<br /><br />Can it be argued that the media are becoming ever more untrustworthy?  Yes.  A case can be made for that as well.  And once again, the authors miss an opportunity to address their readers in a civilized and honest manner.<br /><br />Folks, it doesn't have to be this way.  If you have a case, please make it!  When you want to expose lies, just do it!  Sure, many of the authors of this book have very bad records when it comes to honesty.  But I'd ignore that and just read the book on its merits if they would put the past behind them and simply tell the truth.  And my advice has to be: if you want to fight lies, tell the truth.  When you publish a book like this one, be on your best behavior.<br /><br />In any case, the actual book is a ridiculous joke.	2004-11-24

I think it is worth reading just to get started on thinking about some of these issues oneself.<br /><br />Harris starts out with a terrific point.  Namely that Victor Davis Hanson and Noam Chomsky, who are at roughly opposite ends of the political spectrum, agree that the attacks of 9/11 were an act of war, designed \\"to further some kind of political objective.\\"  Harris explains that 9/11 was actually more an enactment of a \\"fantasy ideology\\" than some Clausewitzian act of war.  That's interesting.  His point is that there was no military follow-up nor military goals, nor the military wherewithal to back up such acts.  But that begs a question.  What if people simply did reasonable things, such as settling for no more than their fair share.  Would we consider that to be acting out their fantasies as well?<br /><br />The next point is that we're facing an unstable situation: those who fight us are not actually viable entities in the sense of being able to deal with and survive any uncompromising attack by internal or external enemies.  That means that they may be facing a big surprise if anyone, including us, ever decides to or needs to fight them seriously.  And we may be facing an equally nasty surprise if they get their hands on nuclear weapons and launch a rogue strike on us.<br /><br />After that is a discussion about ruthlessness.  No society can be based simply on rule by a ruthless gang.  As a matter of fact, such a gang can't even create a society: at most it can take over a society.  Therefore, Harris argues, gangs not only should be driven from the face of the Earth but are inherently incapable of ruling in the long run.  They are on the wrong side of history.  So, why should we support them?  The author explains that we shouldn't.  It may be expedient, but certainly not moral to contain ruthless gangs rather than remove them.  And \\"there may be good conservative reasons for preserving a wicked status quo, but there are no liberal progressive ones.\\"<br /><br />Harris then discusses tolerance.  He makes the point that \\"compromise\\" with error simply means that you need to keep re-inventing the right answer.  And that while individual liberty is very important, if it surpasses all else it will eventually destroy all social order, which is the very thing that allows us to live in peace with one another in the first place.<br /><br />The author also warns us about \\"sham multiculturalism,\\" in which we abandon the individual and make each person the property of their culture, and applaud when that culture gives them almost no freedom at all.<br /><br />Harris concludes that America ought not become an Empire of any kind, let alone an arrogant one.  But that we need to reserve the option of acting unilaterally and at our own discretion, if we must do so, \\"not to subvert the rules of international liberalism but to uphold them.\\"  He warns that ruthless gangs must not be allowed to decide the direction of the future development of mankind.  And that today, the most obvious ruthless gangs may change in nature at any time.<br /><br />I see that a few reviewers tried to label this book as an unthinking defence of American power.  Those reviewers must have missed almost all of what the author said.

That includes magnetic shielding from cosmic rays, ultraviolet radiation, and effects of cosmic rays.  The fourth section is about gravity: gravitational effects at the cellular level, and effects of gravity on plants and animals.  And the fifth section is about complexity and life: scaling phenomena, molecular self-assembly, and what it would be like to look for fossils in an extraterrestrial environment.  The book concludes with a paper about forthcoming space missions relevant to astrobiology.<br /><br />This book has plenty of useful material for astrobiologists!	2004-11-23

Actually, I'm not sure how true that is.  People may be better at telling kids how to tidy up their rooms, but I've seen some rather messy rooms!<br /><br />And people may say that FORTRAN and PL/I are absurd languages to use as examples today.  I'm not so sure about that.  As a programmer, you may very well see old and confusing programs written in either language, especially FORTRAN.  And anyone who can program in more modern languages ought to be able to read the programs.<br /><br />It's easy to read, it's still interesting, and it raises some issues of style that are worth thinking about.  Strunk and White (The Elements of Style) is still worth reading.  And so is this.	2004-11-23

What it says is solid and valid.  There's very little speculation, and when something speculative is said, it is clearly labeled as such.<br /><br />This explains what we Know about the Big Bang.  Not what we think happened, but what we can prove happened.  What we know because we see the expansion of the universe, because we see the cosmic microwave background, and because we see the leftover helium from Big Bang nucleosynthesis in those awesome three or four minutes in which our universe was truly a hot place.<br /><br />You need very little background to appreciate this book: just an interest in what happened in our Universe in less than four minutes, more than ten billion years ago.

And sure, I care about the positions of the planets as well.  This book is indeed useful for that.  And, yes, you can put the equations on your computer or calculator or PDA.  And there's an appendix that gives mean orbital elements for Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars as well as osculating orbital elements for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto for the years 1941 through 2049.  That's useful too!<br /><br />But I confess, the real reason I got this book, and the real use I put it to is simple.  I can get really confused about how to go between geocentric ecliptic, geocentric equatorial, heliocentric, horizontal, and topocentric coordinates.

Everyone ought to read this splendid book by Natan Sharansky and discover, as he did, the power of one's \\"inner freedom, the power of a free society, and the power of the solidarity of the free world.\\"<br /><br />Sharansky starts by insisting on moral clarity.  \\"Societies that do not allow dissent will never protect human rights.\\"  Therefore, we must insist on freedom, not support for what seem to be friendly dictators.  He points out that the 9/11 attacks were a logical consequence of supporting the stability of a dictatorial Saudi Arabia.  And he's convinced that \\"all peoples desire to be free,\\" and that \\"freedom anywhere will make the world safer everywhere.\\"<br /><br />The author explains that unless folks can express their views without fear of reprisals, their society isn't free.  Instead, it is a \\"fear society,\\" in which more and more people are forced to avoid saying what they really think.  Fear societies brainwash many people, especially the young, but Sharansky points out that eventually, the constant lies simply won't hold up, the nation becomes uncompetitive, and there is hope for change.<br /><br />A major criticism of democracy is that extremists will get elected democratically.  Sharansky explains that this may be a problem with fear societies in which \\"elections\\" are held before they have really reformed.  However, a truly free society that opposes you is less of a threat than a fear society that supports you.<br /><br />The author shows how the Helsinki process led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.  And how the USSR, by allowing even a few people to emigrate, lowered the degree of control it had on its subjects.<br /><br />Sharansky is at his best in describing the Oslo \\"peace process\\" fiasco.  Here, Arafat was allowed to establish a fear society in the West Bank, and people who said they wanted peace actually thought Arafat needed to be \\"strengthened!\\"  However, Sharansky is probably correct when he says that peace between the Arabs and Israel is possible only if the Arab world can be convinced to respect human rights.<br /><br />There is a good description of the Camp David mess, where Barak tried to give up much of Jerusalem (something of great value to the Jews and, as we all got to see, rather little value to the Arabs).  Arafat simply turned down this offer and started a war instead.  And Barak responded to Arab terror by offering even more concessions.  In addition, Barak had no support for such concessions and therefore no authority to try to make them.  But the damage done by these proposals is considerable given that they are thought by many to be the starting point for new negotiations.<br /><br />Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount is put in proper perspective: it was not a provocation, as Israeli ministers and Knesset members had been visiting the Temple Mount regularly.  And they do so today.<br /><br />Sharansky reminds us that many who ask for freedom for West Bank Arabs have it backwards.  Under Israeli \\"occupation,\\" the Arabs could speak their minds, publish their opinions, practice their faith, and learn their own history and culture.  They were in a free society.  And he points out that Amnesty International is one organization that has succumbed to a lack of moral clarity, as it implies that Israel is a bigger violator of human rights than Saudi Arabia (!), a nation that has no freedom of speech, the press, or religion.<br /><br />This lack of moral compass extends to those who find an equivalence between terrorists who blow up buses to kill as many civilians as possible and those on the other side who refuse to appease terror.  And the author shows that it includes the UN-appointed International Court of Justice, which unjustly ruled against a fence to protect against suicide bombers.<br /><br />It also extends to those who failed to see the 2002 Israeli operation in Jenin as an \\"unprecedented commitment to the human rights of a foreign civilian population during wartime.\\"  I agree.  To me, Israel's behavior was supremely praiseworthy and showed true respect for human rights.  And Sharansky points out the statements of some in the media who failed to see it that way, but instead accused Israel of war crimes.  Those people clearly demonstrated their total lack of any moral compass.<br /><br />And it extends to those who boast about the \\"peace\\" between Israel and Egypt but overlook the fact that Egypt has since become one of the most anti-Semitic Arab nations.<br /><br />Sharansky uses three tests to see if anti-Israeli statements are anti-Semitic.  The first is \\"demonization,\\" such as comparing Israeli policies to those of the Germans under \\"national socialism.\\"  The second is \\"double standards,\\" such as those employed by the United Nations or the International Red Cross.  The third is \\"delegitimization,\\" namely going beyond criticizing Israeli policies to question its right to exist.<br /><br />In the author's opinion, one-sided Israeli concessions to Arab terrorists will simply strengthen the forces of fear and terror, and make peace more remote.  The way he suggests to measure progress towards peace is not how much Israel has appeased the terrorists (I'd regard this as a measure of retreat from peace), but how free Arab society in the West Bank is.<br /><br />Sharansky concludes that the free world ought not wait for dictatorships to reform, nor get support from international organizations that are dominated by dictatorships, but create a coalition of free nations that would turn the right to dissent as a test for international legitimacy.<br /><br />Get this book and read it and make sure your friends read it!ulation during wartime.\\"  I agree.

It is sad that it is difficult to adequately explain many of their properties in a book for the layman.  This book does a great job, but it is basically a textbook for graduate students.<br /><br />This book does review the fundamentals of compact stars.  It shows the evidence that the source of energy for a supernova is the binding energy of a neutron star (that binding energy is about ten per cent of the mass).<br /><br />Compact stars are relativistic, the book teaches us General Relativity, in what I consider a very readable and instructive chapter.  The Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations are then derived to obtain the gravitational mass and pressure gradient for a static and spherically symmetric compact star.  We're also reminded of a famous test of General Relativity provided by the Hulse-Taylor pulsar binary discovered in 1974.  That test found a decay in the orbital period of 0.76 microseconds per year, agreeing to within a percent of the calculations of energy loss through gravitational radiation predicted by General Relativity: convincing evidence if you ask me!<br /><br />And we're reminded that some of these compact stars rotate at very high rates.  And that objects falling towards them starting at rest from a great distance fall not towards the center of the star but instead acquire ever larger angular velocities as they approach.<br /><br />After that we learn some theoretical basics about white dwarves and neutron stars, their temperatures, the stellar sequences that produce them, and black holes.<br /><br />Next we find we need to learn some Lagrangian Field Theory, so that we can try to derive a relativistically covariant theory of dense hadronic matter (the likely constituent of neutron stars).  We learn about sigma-omega models and the isospin force.  And the author also gets to the question of whether neutron matter is bound or unbound.  While neutron stars are clearly bound by gravity, not the nuclear force, the issue is whether there is a bound state of neutron matter at any density.  If so, then the surfaces of neutron stars are, well, neutrons, rather than some overlying layer of matter at subnuclear density.<br /><br />There's a section on the observational evidence for neutron stars, namely pulsar observations.  And then we get into the constitution (including the hyperon density) and phase transitions in neutron stars, followed by an extensive discussion of rotating neutron stars.<br /><br />There's a discussion of pulsar \\"glitches\\" which are hypothesized to be starquakes, caused by deceleration-induced stress on the crust of the star. I wish Glendenning had said more about an additional possibility, namely that the star is a rotating neutron superfluid, penetrated by an array of vortex lines, and that the glitches are transitions between metastable states of the vortex array.  There are also analogies with experiments done on superfluid liquid helium that support this, so I was hoping to see a discussion of it.  Either way, the glitches seem to imply the existence of a crust, ruling out theories of a bound state of neutron matter.<br /><br />Finally, we've gotten to the fun stuff: quark stars. After all, quarks are the constituents of nucleons, and they're asymptotically free.  So are there hybrid stars, with quark matter in the central region and a nuclear matter mantle?  That gets us into our introduction to the concept of strange and charm stars, and the MIT bag model of quark confinement.  And at the end of the book, we see discussions of the structure of strange quark stars.  This is an exciting field, as observations of sub-millisecond pulsars would imply the existence of these strange quark stars.  That in turn would imply that the actual ground state of the stong interaction is not quarks confined in hadrons but deconfined strange quark matter.  In short. \\"it would tell us that the universe is in a very long-lived but excited state.\\"<br /><br />This is a very interesting book, and it is a shame that it requires so much background material to appreciate it.ckground material to appreciate it.	2004-11-22

And the prefaces by Thomas Sugrue and by Walter Kaufmann are good too.<br /><br />As a Pagan, I've wondered about the horror some people have had for human rights.  This goes for plenty of groups that have attacked others mainly in order to enslave them, kill them, and above all, deprive them of truth, justice, and human rights.<br /><br />Pagans are not immune from behaving badly.  But I wanted to see just what Christians did, and when they did it.  And while Christians managed to kill most of the European Pagans they came across in short order, many Jews were not so, um, lucky: quite a few survived to be further oppressed.<br /><br />Well, how did this all happen?  Malcolm Hay asks this question after relating some of the horror of what happened to the Jews during World War 2.  Where had this hatred and contempt come from?  Why all the anti-Jewish propaganda?  Was this contrary to Christianity?  An integral part of it?  Which Christian leaders were truly the most to blame for it?  As a Christian, Hay clearly wants to know how to make sense of all this.<br /><br />Hay starts with the Gospel according to St. John, which refers to \\"the Jews\\" in a very negative way, and more important refers to them in general.  He then goes to the fourth century, and looks at some of the language used about the Jews by the leading Christians.  That includes St. John Chrysostom, who is still very highly regarded by Christian writers.  However, \\"the violence of the language used by St. John Chrysostom in his homilies against the Jews has never been exceeded by any preacher whose sermons have been recorded.\\"  This hatred is traced through the Dark Ages down through the centuries, to the present.<br /><br />I think this confirms that a main source of the problem was from the time when Christianity first became powerful.  And I think it raises the question of whether hatred was the main message of Christianity at that time.<br /><br />We then see how this hatred became part of the culture, so that violence could erupt without any real provocation at numerous times.  We see St. Bernard's indifference to Crusader attacks on Jews.  We see outbreaks of blood-libels.  Of the Inquisition.  And mistreatment by one Pope after another.  And of the viciousness against Jews displayed by Martin Luther.  And the Dreyfus affair.<br /><br />I think the most interesting part of the book is the description of how this culture contributed to slanders and injustices perpetrated against Zionists in the first half of the twentieth century.  This book was written in 1950, and it is worth reading about the antisemitism of many Europeans towards the Levantine Jews (many of whom were of European origin).  I think this helps one to see how European antisemitic attitudes supported some of the most racist Arabs and have helped perpetuate Arab intolerance for all non-Arabs and non-Muslims, not just for Jews.<br /><br />All in all, it is a superbly written book.  It's depressing to read it, of course.  One wonders what is wrong with a species that can do so much damage to itself almost effortlessly.violence could erupt without any real provocation at numerous times.

It discusses roots of terrorism, jihad, suicide missions, intelligence failures by the West, anti-Americanism, and future potential battlefields.<br /><br />It defines terrorism as \\"the systematic use of murder, injury, and destruction, or threat of such acts, aimed at achieving political ends.\\"  And it mocks those who insist on calling terrorists \\"activists\\" as though they were merely devoting some time to a political party or local club.  He asks if we then ought to call Jack the Ripper \\"an amateur abdominal surgeon.\\"<br /><br />Laqueur explains that the main threat now is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  He also discusses the connection between terrorists and the drug trade but points out that these groups are not natural allies: criminals want to preserve the status quo that keeps them in business, while terrorists want to mess things up.<br /><br />And the author points out that there is no end in sight to terror: the terrorists will go on fighting for a very long time whether we fight back or not.  For example, many Islamists believe that it is a sin against nature to allow Jews to exist in Jerusalem or Israel.  This is not conducive to peace.<br /><br />Laqueur also points out cases in which media supporters of terror have gone way out of bounds, including the Guardian, in England.<br /><br />But there was one thing about this book that got me thinking more than any other.  Namely the claim that Israel was foolish not to have surrendered the entire West Bank to the Arabs - any Arabs - immediately after winning the six-day war, even without any truce or peace or anything.  Was this just a slip on Laqueur's part, or a symptom of poor thinking about terrorism in general?<br /><br />I think it is a symptom of a more serious problem in the author's thinking.  After all, there are two errors we see here.  First, we see the claim that it would have been moral and practical for a land-poor nation to give disputed land to an enemy that holds itself to be superior and holds you to be trash.  Second, we see the claim that it would be possible to convince the majority of the people in a democracy to simply roll over and unilaterally surrender their rights to an annihilationist enemy, given the disastrous results they had doing just that in World War 2.  And I think this is a symptom of a larger problem of blaming ourselves just a little too much for the sins of the criminals who attack us.<br /><br />What I think Laqueur needs to do is adopt some moral standards.  There is a difference between being just and unjust.  One can try to pretend that one does not know who one is, a Muslim, Jew, Buddhist, Christian, Chinese, Arab, American, man, woman, adult, child, or whatever.  And then try to come up with a just solution, knowing that one would find out who one was only afterwards.  That would help clarify blame a little better.  Another question Laqueur ought to ask is this: is he refusing to demand rights for his \\"friends\\" that he routinely demands for his enemies?  I think he fails both questions on this little test.  There is no need to make matters worse by alienating people who have the option of supporting terrorism, but I think that outright appeasement is almost always terribly counterproductive, and tends to establish a right of the terrorists to attack and oppress others.<br /><br />So I'll give this book three stars.  I don't recommend it.  I think you ought to go out and buy Sharansky's book (The Case for Democracy) instead.  Or maybe Paul Berman's (Terror and Liberalism).  What we all need is truth and moral clarity.

Books	5	34	39	N	N	What we know about constraints on population growth	Obviously, the population of the world has been growing dramatically for the past few centuries.  How high can it go?  At how high a level can it be maintained?  What restrictions are placed by the available resources, such as food and water?<br /><br />This book asks many of the right questions.  And it admits that we don't have all the answers.  But it does give some clues about where we may be headed.<br /><br />Cohen shows that basically, if we want to support people indefinitely on 3500 kilocalories per day from wheat energy, with 9000 cubic kilometers of annual fresh water supply, well, we can support only 5 billion people.  We're already beyond that.  Right now, we're using up resources at an incredible rate.  And while the Earth could support 10 billion people in theory, it is hard to see how it could do that for long in practice.<br /><br />The author thinks that we'll never get to the absolute maximum that the Earth can support.  Most people would all be right on the edge of starvation, and we'd simply be unable and unwilling to stay in that state indefinitely.  But I did realize after reading this book that we could stay at about 5 billion people for a very long time if we put our minds to it.  Standards of living would not be high, but they would be tolerable for the majority, and the ones who found such a life acceptable would keep having children who found it acceptable.<br /><br />Those of us who have political views ought to wonder if time is on our side or not.  And that is why I think it makes sense to try to imagine what options are available for our mutual future.  That's why I think this book is worth reading.	2004-11-22

Written by a Jewish resident.  And while the meat of this book is the tale of how Jebusites are dealing with the risks and tragedies, I was most intrigued by the reactions to historical events.<br /><br />We get to see, on Balint's diary entry for October 6, 2000, that a \\"sea change\\" had taken place in Israeli attitudes about the prospects of peace in less than a month.  The Israeli public had known that incendiary material fed to Arab schoolchildren was bound to result in violence.  But it was surprised to discover the extent to which Arab citizens of Israel supported the same annihilationist goals as Hamas and Islamic Jihad.<br /><br />And we get to see the lack of surprise when the Associated Press routinely reports Israeli self-defence as though it were unprovoked malice.<br /><br />We also get to see her view of Sharon's defeat of Barak in the 2000 Israeli elections.  Sharon won by a landslide, and Balint points out that Barak misread the willingness of the Israeli public to cede parts of Jerusalem.  She doesn't even mention the problem of negotiating under fire with a party that will break any agreement anyway and then blame you for it.<br /><br />Perhaps the most telling remarks the author makes are about the counterproductive manner in which European nations are interfering in the fighting.  She explains that European nations fund the textbooks used in the West Bank \\"that promote hatred of Jews and intolerance of Israel's right to exist.\\"  And she shows how Europe donates hundreds of thousands of dollars to marginal Israeli political groups on the extreme left, in hopes of undermining Israeli democracy.	2004-11-21

I like comprehensive textbooks that cover a subject convincingly.  If I had to teach a class in Planetary Science, I'd probably pick the book by de Pater and Lissauer.  That's a really good comprehensive text.  But this one is good too.  And I certainly would enjoy teaching planetary science from either book.<br /><br />What this book does is cover descriptive planetary science in twelve chapters, covering about 190 pages.  These chapters require very little prior knowledge of mathematics, physics, or astronomy.<br /><br />After that come 42 chapters on very specific topics.  These take another 280 pages or so, and they require a little more knowledge of mathematics, physics and astronomy.  They also teach some fundamentals of physics and astronomy that prospective planetary scientists need to know.  Look at the table of contents to see the topics in this section.<br /><br />The benefits of this approach are twofold.  First, the book can be used to teach a course at a rather elementary level, using mostly the first part of the text.  Second, the book avoids the trap of glossing over a large number of topics without explaining any of them really well: the 42 well-chosen topics are presented wonderfully.<br /><br />The negative side of all this is that some topics are omitted.  I'd never think of writing a book like this one.  But I'm sure glad Cole and Woolfson did!	2004-11-21

It may seem to have evidence for its speculations, but that isn't the issue.<br /><br />Many of the speculations involve the readiness of various Arab nations to engage in major regional wars.  And let's face it, these are just speculations.  People on both sides have to take the possibility of war seriously.  That means that war is a threat, but it doesn't mean that anyone is about to start one.<br /><br />But the book got five stars from me anyway, just for being the best so far of a bunch of books about the Arab-Israeli \\"peace process.\\"  It got those five stars for doing the pedestrian chores of reporting the day-to-day action on the ground, much of which is simply and purely factual.  That puts much of the negotiating in the proper perspective.<br /><br />The day-to-day action includes the visit of Sharon to the Temple Mount, a move that clearly was a litmus test: would Jews even be permitted to visit their holiest site in the event of a \\"peace agreement.\\"  Israel carefully got permission from Rajub, who was in charge of fifty Arab \\"security personnel\\" there.  And Bodansky says that Barak also got assurances from Arafat that there would be no problem.  Of course, Arafat and Rajub planned to use this visit to cause trouble.  And Bodansky then points out that this flunked the litmus test, showing most Israelis that the Arab side was completely untrustworthy.  It threw away an incredible Israeli offer to pull its people, including thousands of Israeli civilians living in their native land, out of parts of the West Bank.  And it threw away much of the political power of Israeli Arabs, who were no longer trusted much after they rioted against, in effect, their own country's right to exist.<br /><br />Day-to-day action includes the almost total lack of response by Israel to initial Arab attacks in 2000.  This refusal to fight was obviously to guarantee that everyone would see that the Arabs were the aggressors.  Bodansky points out that this idea failed, and the Israelis were labelled as aggressors by many seemingly neutral people anyway.<br /><br />Day-to-day action also reminds us of the significance of the interception of the Karine-A, a ship from Iran that was sent to supply Arafat's terrorists with heavy weapons.  That event obviously convinced some formerly misled people about what was going on, and it made it impossible for others to deny the truth in administration circles.  Did it make a difference in how the U. S. administration behaved after that?  Maybe.<br /><br />Day-to-day action also includes the events of April, 2002, when the Israeli army moved against Jenin.  Here, Bodansky is correct to point out that Israeli troops behaved admirably, and that there was in fact no massacre, and that Arab and European claims to the contrary were lies.  And he was right to point out that the IDF used its infantry rather than tanks in order to minimize civilian casualties.<br /><br />Actually, I think most Jews in Israel realized the danger of sending ground forces into Jenin.  And I think doing so was a successful attempt by Sharon to do what many people in the Israeli \\"peace camp\\" had advised: to make sure that his army behaved with impeccable morality.  It did so.  And lost in the noise of the accusations from Arabs and Europeans may have been the winning over of much of the Israeli \\"peace camp\\" to Sharon in this battle.  Well, that is a speculation, and I certainly won't fault Bodansky for not stating it!<br /><br />Anyway, yes, I'm suspicious of Bodansky's speculations, suspicious of his political stances, and suspicious of any book on the topic.

Some are about past history, and some are about present history. And a few deal with history itself. Lewis explains that there will always be people who demand to falsify, fabricate, eradicate, invent, distort, or misuse history. But he says these people must be opposed, because otherwise they will win. And if we thus abandon history, we'll no longer be able to have a knowledge about the past, understand the present, or use that information to influence what happens next.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite of the articles was one from 1979 about the United Nations. It is at least as important today as it was then. Lewis explains that there is a religious sect called the Yazidis. They believe that there is a God and a Devil. They believe that God is good, and therefore won't cause them any trouble. But the Devil is evil and may do just that. So they offer almost all their prayers to the Devil, not to God.<br /><br />And that is how Lewis describes the United Nations, where nations know that if they attack or offend the Arabs, that may be costly and risky. But if they attack or offend the United States and its policies, they risk nothing. Instead, they gratify America's enemies and win acclaim and respect from many American allies, as well as many Americans, American policy-makers, and a significant portion of the American media.<br /><br />That article alone made this book worthwhile. And there are fifty articles in addition to it.	2004-11-20

It can take a bright reader who has no more than an undergraduate college degree in a technical field and bring that person to a point where they can read and understand technical papers about fundamental physics and cosmology. It discusses these topics in a way not open to many books for the layman, since it has brought the reader up to speed on the necessary mathematics. Some of the math can be skipped, of course, but it is there to bring the material to life.<br /><br />Of course, that means starting the book with over 350 pages of math, taught in impressive style by the author, including Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry, number theory, complex numbers, logarithms, complex powers, real and complex calculus, Riemann surfaces, Fourier series, Vector fields, Quaternions, Manifolds, Symmetry groups, and Fibre bundles! That allows him to proceed to discuss quantum mechanics and the rest of fundamental physics.<br /><br />It is true that Penrose does mention his views about inflation and string theory. But the fact that he has views about these theories does not in any way stop him from being a great teacher. He covers the field of fundamental physics very well indeed.<br /><br />Penrose does impart a very important viewpoint that I think is valuable for us all. Most scientists are basically positivists: that is, they search for theories that will correspond to measurements (pass experimental tests and provide accurate predictions). It is secondary to them what reality happens to be. But there is something to be said for asking what the reality behind the physics actually is.<br /><br />If you are a very bright high school graduate about to go to some top notch university to try to become a theoretical physicist, read this book now!	2004-11-20

But I think it can be used for a first course on astronomy and astrophysics (for students with some basic calculus and physics).<br /><br />It covers everything:  Celestial mechanics, the Sun and its planetary system, electromagnetic radiation, telescopes and detectors, astrophysics of individual stars, star clusters, interstellar matter, the Milky Way, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, cosmology, and cosmogony.  But the style is concise, and there isn't enough space to cover it all in detail.  It requires careful reading, and if used for a class, some topics probably need to be skipped or amplified by an instructor.<br /><br />What would I add to it?  Not much.  Maybe a little more on planetary dynamics and magnetospheres, since I happen to find them interesting.  Perhaps more material on relativity.	2004-11-20

I like the explanations, the diagrams, the marvellous photographs, the exercises.  It covers pretty much everything I'd want as a teacher or student, and in well under 600 pages.  Maybe the parts I liked best were the sections on relativity and cosmology.  But it was all just great, as it sailed through telescopes, stars, spectra, binaries,the Sun, stellar evolution, the Milky Way, star formation, the interstellar medium, normal galaxies, active galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and the Sun's planetary system.  The treatment of the solar planetary system included planetary atmospheres, surfaces, and interiors.  It even talked about planetary resonances.<br /><br />One weakness, to my way of thinking, was the overly brief appendix on astronomical coordinates and timekeeping.  And there were a couple of minor topics I would have wanted to see mentioned.  One was Gamma Ray Bursters.  Another was Blue Stragglers.	2004-11-20

And yes, you have to do the problems to get full value from the book.  For example, in Chapter 3, the book discusses the Hohmann transfer, which gets us between two circular coplanar orbits with the least velocity change with two impulse transfers.  Now, some people I know think that this is the best you can do!  That you can't get there with less delta-v.  However, that's simply false.  And the authors point this out in problems 3.9 and 3.10 at the end of the chapter, where they discuss bielliptical transfers.<br /><br />If I were trying to become adept at doing astrodynamics, I'd be sure to make use of computers as well.  I'd have exercises where I developed or modified some code, maybe in Matlab.  I'd use these for getting answers, showing the effects of approximations, and visualizing solutions.  The book suggests using computers and even has some computer-based exercises, but it was written in 1971, and computer-based options are much, much better here in the 21st century.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-11-19

And while there is some exciting action, the overall scenario is what creates the lasting impression.<br /><br />In this story, people can make multiple copies of themselves every day.  It's fantasy, so I'll overlook questions of just how similar these copies are to real people, and how they can look and act very much like real people.  Anyway, these copies only last about a day.<br /><br />Still, the idea of having a new version of oneself every day is fairly complex.  How would you like to be just a copy?  Would you consider life cheap, given that you would exist only for one day?  Would you actually exist only for one day?  Would it really make that big a difference to you whether or not your memories for all or part of that day were incorporated into the person you were copied from?<br /><br />One thing is clear, a person could literally die a thousand times.  You could take suicidal risks as a matter of course: you (or someone with your memories) would still wake up the next day and try again.  And that sets the stage for this story, which treats the topic in an interesting manner, where the \\"real\\" people tend to let  copies of themselves do most of the real work.  One part that I thought was rather clever was letting some of those copies be noticeably smarter than the originals.  In the story, the protagonist is a detective, and some of his copies can think circles around him.<br /><br />But I won't spoil the story.  I think it's worth reading.	2004-11-19

It's back in print!	The lovely Lady is missing!  She's been spotted three times.  And the hero, the best and brightest of young Men, goes looking for Her!  There is no time to lose.  Will she be found by New Year's Day?  What an adventure story!<br /><br />Well, actually, this is a book about mathematics and celestial mechanics.  And it isn't exactly new: it was written in 1809.<br /><br />But this isn't just a history book.  Nor is it nearly impossible to read, like Newton's Principia.  This is the exciting tale, in great mathematical detail, of the techniques that enabled Gauss to find Ceres.  And how the same methods can be used to find Juno and Pallas given three observations of them, or Vesta given two complete and two incomplete observations.<br /><br />For those who don't know this, Ceres was discovered by Giuseppe Piazzi, a 40-year old mathematics professor, on January 1, 1801.  Piazzi observed Ceres twenty more times, the final time on February 11.  After that, Ceres was lost.  In the September, 1801 issue of the Monatliche Correspondenz, Piazzi published his entire set of observations of Ceres.  Karl Gauss, then 24 years old, took only a few weeks to predict the path of Ceres, in surprisingly good agreement with modern values.  He sent his results to Franz von Zach, the editor of the Monatliche Correspondenz.  On December 31, 1801, von Zach unambiguously confirmed the recovery of Ceres.<br /><br />This book has not aged well, of course.  Gauss, one of the greatest mathematicians ever, was forced to do his calculations without the aid of modern computers.  And so we see plenty of  mathematical tricks that we can all appreciate, but for the most part are unnecessary today (and we can be glad that we rarely need to employ them ourselves).<br /><br />Still, if you want to understand orbital mechanics, this is a remarkably good book to read.  It is surprisingly easy to follow all the math, and once you've read it, you'll be able to solve plenty of orbital mechanics problems.<br /><br />And if you ever want to solve some really tough problems in orbital mechanics, Gauss is a great teacher.  You'll gain valuable insight about what approximations are available and when to make them.<br />And if you ever want to solve some really tough problems in orbital mechanics, Gauss is a great teacher.

But it is not primarily a guide for clarinetists who want general advice on subjects such as embouchure and reed selection.  Jack Brymer's book, \\"Clarinet,\\" is a guide for clarinetists.  This is a book about the clarinet that anyone interested in the clarinet can appreciate.  Still, it does include some expert advice on plenty of topics, including embouchure, tone, fingering, synchronization, and so forth.<br /><br />This is more of a survey of all the different clarinets (as well as their histories), clarinet repertoire, and modern trends.  There are nice chapters on the clarinet family, including the high clarinets, the C clarinet, the basset horn, and the bass clarinet.  The basset horn is famous for its huge range (four octaves!).  But Georgina Dobree explains that it isn't easy to play.  You need a soft reed, you have to be careful in all registers.  And although it is easy to hit the high notes (especially if you have one of the smaller-bore ones), you may need alternate fingerings to play them in tune.  Personally, I think the basset clarinet is a better instrument to learn, if you have the money to acquire one.<br /><br />Michael Harris discusses my favorite of the clarinets, the bass clarinet.  I like it because its range extends far enough down so that one can play a wide variety of parts.  Harris again explains that it isn't so tough to hit the highest notes on this instrument, but one has to choose a mouthpiece that lets you hit the next highest octave as well.  Roger Heaton's chapter includes some good fingering choices for the highest notes.<br /><br />Then there are chapters on the clarinet repertoire, players and composers, clarinet recordings, the clarinet in jazz, the mechanics of playing the clarinet, and teaching the clarinet.  Then we get some expert advice on how to play historical clarinets, from Colin Lawson.  It's written in a style that is interesting for us non-professionals.  Next is some explicit advice for the prospective professional clarinetist, from Nicholas Cox.<br /><br />The most fascinating chapter is by Roger Heaton, on the contemporary clarinet.  That covers some topics such as high note fingerings, microtones, and circular breathing.<br /><br />You don't need to know much about the clarinet to enjoy this book.  But to profit from the more expert advice, you need to play the clarinet fairly well already.ce for the prospective professional clarinetist, from Nicholas Cox. <br /> <br />The most fascinating chapter is by Roger Heaton, on the contemporary clarinet.

It's considered a masterpiece, and for good reason.<br /><br />But there is still one small comment I would like to make.  Read the play.  Then ask yourself who on Earth the character Goneril was.

As living creatures, we all have a sense, either unconscious, conscious, or both, of purpose.  But how does this purposefulness, or \\"Life-Urge\\" fit into how we view ourselves, from a religious point of view?<br /><br />Carleton says there are four main ways in which people can do this.  First, one can view oneself as \\"Me.\\"  That is, the sense of purpose is one's own purpose and no more.  Second, one can view oneself as a living being among many living beings, all of whom have a sense of purpose.  Third, one can view oneself as part of Life, which has a unified Purpose (basically, a Buddhist point of view).  Fourth, one can view oneself as an entity whose purpose is secondary to what really counts, namely one or more Goddesses or Gods and Her, His, or Their Purpose.  The author strongly prefers the second of these viewpoints, which he calls \\"prototheism.\\"<br /><br />This idea is contrasted with what today is practically a majority concept, namely the fourth point of view: ascribing the Life Urge to a single Deity.  Of course, monotheistic religions today generally prescribe specific theologies, sets of beliefs, and practices to vast numbers of people.  But Carleton shows that even now, there are alternatives for people who want more flexibilty, freedom, or privacy in their religious practices.<br /><br />Still, all this is the icing on the cake.  I left out decribing the cake, namely the initial chapters of the book.  Here, Carleton starts with an excellent summary of the origin of Catholic Christianity (there are appendices that discuss Protestantism, Judaism, and Islam).  He starts with the origin of the concept of deities, but adds that when one considers, say, fire to be a deity, it \\"closes out any attempt to learn the true nature of fire.\\"<br /><br />Given the tendency for origins to be viewed in religious ways, Carleton gives some more excellent summaries....of the way we view origins scientifically.  In roughly sixty impressive pages, he covers the origin of our Universe, the origin of the Earth, the origin of life on Earth, the evolution of life to arrive at humans, and the origin of human society and of societal theistic beliefs (if you think all this is easy to write, you try it).  After that, he speculates about the attributes of the conscious and unconscious parts of our thinking and responses, and how that has contributed to our sense of purpose and of religion.<br /><br />So what is to be done about the fact that much of the world is monotheistic today?  Carleton basically advises tolerance, not potentially risky and disruptive confrontation.  Attitudes are changing.  Let them.  His recommendations are to move in a direction (towards prototheism) that he feels we are heading in anyway.<br /><br />I recommend this book.  Nobody is going to agree with every single point in it, but it has plenty for us all to think about.n roughly sixty impressive pages, he covers the origin of our Universe, the origin of the Earth, the origin of life on Earth, the evolution of life to arrive at humans, and the origin of human society and of societal theistic beliefs (if you think all this is easy to write, you try it).

Most folks don't blow themselves up. Most ladies don't do it. And even if one suddenly decided to do so, most do not have access to the explosives.<br /><br />This book explains some of the pressures these women were put under, and how they were led into such destructive tasks.<br /><br />It's touching and heartbreaking.<br /><br />The author shows us how six-year old girls in first grade are indoctrinated to the extent that they all are eager to be martyrs, so they can cause deaths of Jews and go to Paradise.  As we learn, to prospective martyrs, Paradise is a place no Jews ever get to!<br /><br />Still, there are some outstanding questions I'm sure we all have. First, is this tactic, um, working? Will it achieve something? Second, just what is the overall goal of those who send these ladies out on such missions, if any? Third, just where is the support and funding coming for the entire operation, including the propaganda and training? Fourth, what can be done to stop it?<br /><br />To some extent, the tactic is \\"working.\\" Suicide bombings are big news. I think antizionists have long realized that deaths play in their favor, whether they be deaths of Jews or Arabs. Suicide bombing gives one both, what could be better than that? And this book seems to confirm my suspicions in that regard. Meanwhile, whatever the overall goal may be, the result has been to afflict \\"an entire generation with a consuming desire to die.\\"<br /><br />As for the support and funding, well, it has come from Arafat and his coterie. Victor shows that they've force-fed hatred to an entire population. And they've obtained fiscal and political support from Arab nations as well as the European Union.<br /><br />To her credit, Victor shows the analogy between the sacrifice of today's young Arabs and the sacrifices of the, um, Youth in the defence of Berlin in 1945.<br /><br />But isn't there a goal? Freedom? Land? Maybe so! But even here, Victor allows us to be warned that this may not be achievable. After all, Israel is small. It may appear to some people that either the West Bank and Gaza or all of Israel is just the right size to accommodate a new Arab nation: all one has to do is dispose of all the Jews there. But that's not necessarily the case. What if it is simply too small? What if the Arabs that demand a new nation can't fit into just the West Bank and Gaza, or even into all of Israel? Or what if some space is to be left for the Jews? Victor quotes an Israeli general who recommends that some space in the Sinai may be needed to provide enough room.<br /><br />Victor does make a few errors.  One is her claim about UN resolution 242.  She says the French version requires Israel to withdraw from \\"all territories,\\" while the official and binding one says \\"the territories.\\"  But the truth is that the binding one says \\"territories,\\" and has no \\"the.\\"  Neither version has an \\"all.\\"  This was a major issue in the debate over the resolution.  It is no small error on Victor's part.<br /><br />Victor describes the five pillars of Islam.  She gets the last four right: charity, fasting (by day) during Ramadan, pilgrimage to Mecca, and ritual prayer five times a day.  But the first one is \\"Shahadah.\\"  That means affirming the Lord (of Ibrahim) and the Prophet.  Victor says it is \\"martyrdom, the declaration of faith.\\"  Again, this is no small error.<br /><br />The author does make some interesting distinctions among various radical Islamist terrorist groups, telling which ones favor starting by eliminating Israel and which ones prefer to start by creating an Islamic terrorist state in the region.<br /><br />While Victor does not do a good job in addressing the causes of the Arab fight against the Jews, she does have some ideas for solving it. And while I disagree with them, I think they are worth thinking about. She points out that the moderates on each side won't be able to make peace. For one thing, their stands are too far apart. For another, neither can be trusted, as neither speaks for those who are less moderate. She concludes that peace must be made between the extremists on both sides, thus, the positions of the extremists are the most important! Besides, Victor says, extremists have a tendency to say what they mean, quite openly. That may introduce an element of truth and trust.<br /><br />I disagreed with quite a bit of what Victor wrote.

That is, he addresses their arguments that evolution fails to answer some questions that they have devised.<br /><br />Creationist arguments sometimes include claims of the Earth being very young.  The author shows that these are falsified by elementary geology. Matter of fact, some of them are falsified by elementary archaeology.<br /><br />Another claim is that the second law of thermodynamics prevents order from arising naturally.  Futuyama shows that's false.  First the Earth is not a closed system: we get useful energy from the Sun, as well as from volcanic vents.  In addition, has anyone making this claim ever seen a snowflake?  It is easy for order to arise naturally.  As a matter of fact, order tends to arise in a gravitational system as well, as anyone looking at our Solar System can observe.  And an embryo becoming an adult shows an enormous increase in order.<br /><br />One common claim is that life could not have originated \\"by chance.\\"  But, as Futuyama explains, this is suspect, given the compatability of the Earth with life, and given the presence of the ingredients.  I agree.  Sure, one can do a sloppy calculation, and say there is little chance for life to originate.  But given that there is life here, the chances of that calculation being wrong are high.  It's unreasonable to make an argument of the form, \\"I'm not smart enough to figure out exactly how life got here, therefore it never did get here.\\"<br /><br />There are also claims that mutation, recombination and natural selection can't form new features.  In response, Futuyama shows how small changes have led to new features.  And he also answers the question of how a new function, such as sight can develop so that each step confers a competitive advantage.<br /><br />One favorite claim of creationists is the lack of intermediate fossils.  But many of those intermediates actually have been discovered, as Futuyama ponts out.<br /><br />But, of course, had Futuyama failed to answer these questions, that would not overthrow evolution, which is simply a set of facts.  The key to accepting evolution is the positive evidence in its favor, which is so overwhelming that little if any argument needs to be made once one has these facts.<br /><br />As Futuyama shows, that evidence includes fossil records, DNA, embryology, and homologies.  And it is significant that these facts are consistent: as the author explains, a single undisputed Pre-Cambrian fossil of a flowering plant or mammal would falsify most of evolution as we understand it.<br /><br />There is also a chapter on some of what bothers many Creationists, \\"social darwinism.\\"  This is a moral philosophy that attempts to justify unethical behavior on the grounds of natural selection.  Futuyama points out that it is dubious to justify any ethical system on such grounds, and that the claims of the social darwinists are bogus.  Again, I agree.  I don't believe that ethical systems need to be based on the existence or non-existence of evolution.  And they certainly do not need to be based on lies, nor should they be.  We ought to know and teach the truth about evolution.<br /><br />I think this is a valuable guide to evolution and the creationist attacks on it.ponts out. <br /> <br />But, of course, had Futuyama failed to answer these questions, that would not overthrow evolution, which is simply a set of facts.

This one gets my vote!  It seems to cover everything.<br /><br />After a nice introductory chapter comes the first test for this book: a 20-page chapter on dynamics with 5 pages of exercises.  And this book does a great job.  It explains Lagrangian points, orbital resonances, the chaotic nature of the orbit of Pluto, tides, the Yarkovski effect, and so on.  And it just gets better after that, with more than 70 pages on planetary atmospheres (structure, composition, clouds, winds, photochemistry, escape).  This is followed by hefty sections on planetary surfaces, planetary interiors, and planetary magnetospheres, each of which discuss the individual planets and satellites separately.<br /><br />Next is a chapter on meteorites, along with radiometric dating.  A chapter on asteroids: their orbits, size distribution, collisional evolution, surfaces, structures, and asteroid observing techniques.  And a chapter on comets, including their origins and constraints on planetary system formation theories.<br /><br />We return to dynamics for the ensuing chapter, on planetary rings: thicknesses, resonances, density waves, and shepherding.  Following that is a chapter on planet formation, followed by a short concluding chapter on extrasolar planets.<br /><br />The exercises are instructive and useful throughout.  I learned a great deal of material from this book, even though it was nowhere near my first exposure to planetary science.	2004-11-15

And this book is a very useful introduction to some theories about the origin of life.  Dyson starts by stating three of them.  The first theory is Oparin's, where cell frameworks originate first, enzymes second, and genes third.  The second theory is Eigen's, where genes are first, enzymes second, and cells third.  And the third theory is from Cairns-Smith and has clay first, enzymes second, genes third, and cells fourth.<br /><br />As Dyson explains, for the Eigen theory to work, four \\"catastrophes\\" need to be avoided.  First is the \\"error catastrophe,\\" where there are simply too many errors in replication of long RNA molecules.  Second is the \\"selfish RNA catastrophe,\\" where an RNA molecule mutates and dominates the scene, but the mutation takes away its critical role as a catalyst.  Third is the \\"short-circuit catastrophe,\\" where a mutated RNA molecule catalyzes the wrong reaction (a later one in a chain than the proper one).  Fourth is the \\"population collapse catastrophe,\\" where one simply runs<br /><br />out of a critical component.  Dyson wants to pursue other something other than the popular Eigen theory, not just to be different, but also to try to avoid the error catastrophe.  That's why he constructs a \\"toy model\\" for the Oparin theory that can allow up to a 25% error rate.<br /><br />Dyson concludes with a few \\"open questions.\\"  One of the most fundamental is, \\"Given that a population of molecules is able to maintain itself in homeostatic equilibrium at a steady level of metabolism, how many molecular species must the population contain?\\"  This leads to the question, \\"What is the smallest population that is able to constitute a self-replicating system.\\"  Dyson tells about the experiments of Spiegelman (which produced a virus RNA with only 220 nucleotides) and of Eigen (which produced one with 120 nucleotides).<br /><br />This book is easy to read and informative.	2004-11-15

That is why I think Lewis was right to begin his book by giving an example of a bomb that was exploded in 1980 in Paris, at a synagogue.  As Lewis explains, the French Prime Minister said, \\"They aimed at the Jews and they hit innocent Frenchmen.\\"  Now that is clearly not the way he meant to say it.  But the implication that to some extent, many French people view the Jews as neither French nor innocent is worth investigating.<br /><br />Lewis starts by explaining some fundamentals: who the Jews were and are, where they lived in the past and live now, what Zionism was and is, and who the Hebrew-speakers were and are.  He then explains the a little of the history of European antisemitism, or Jew-hatred, over the past few centuries.  After that, there is a discussion of Muslim relations with Jews.<br /><br />This background material allows us to understand a major point Lewis makes: that the close relationship between Germany and the Arab leadership that developed between \\"1933 and 1945 was due not to a German attempt to win over the Arabs but to a series of Arab approaches to the Germans.\\"<br /><br />This leads to an explanation of the way most Arabs use the word \\"Nazi\\" today.  They don't mean by it \\"antisemite.\\"  Such an equivalence would make some Arabs applaud the Nazis while it could make others sympathize with the Jewish victims of the Nazis.  Instead, the term is used as a term of general abuse, so that it can be applied to Jews.<br /><br />Lewis then discusses the Arab war first against Zionism and then against the Jews in general.  He shows that many Arabs are outraged at the success of the Jews, who had been a traditionally oppressed minority.  And some view the existence of Israel as unjust.  But even these views are insufficient to explain the many Arab writers who devote plenty of time and effort to reiterate European antisemitic propaganda and distribute it worldwide.  Such efforts are so manifestly counterproductive to everyone, Arabs included, that Lewis feels it is appropriate to see what motivates them.  And here, Lewis makes a final point: Israel and Zionism are being judged largely not on what they are but on a caricature of what they are that is provided by wild and arbitrary accusations against them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.rldwide.

But, of course, to him, the United States and Israel are evil.  After all, Israel permits Jews to have human rights.  And the United States supports it!<br /><br />Of course, there are some real questions about how the United States ought to use its power.  We have great economic strength and pretty fair military strength.  It's easy to force our neighbors to make deals that favor us.  And it is a great idea for someone to give us some constructive advice and criticism.<br /><br />This book is anything but that.  It's part of the problem, not part of the solution.<br /><br />Still, the existence of this book raises the issue of why it is that so many bright Arabs, both in and out of the academic world, have so much trouble coming up with honest assessments of reality.  And I think the reason is that they are pressured into doing so by both other Arabs and by Westerners.  In the past, many Arabs oppressed minorities as a matter of right.  That wasn't nice, but it wasn't dishonest.  In the past century, many in the West wanted to ally themselves with Arab states, but they had a problem: they could not support outright claims that oppression is good.  So they basically told the Arabs to lie and to blame their victims.  And a large number of Arabs have complied.  It is a shame, because Arabs are just as good people as any others.  It simply happens to be Arabs that have been put under so much pressure to be dishonest.<br /><br />Anyway, this has created a situation in which it is almost de rigeur for many Arab academics to include some standard untruths in their descriptions of Israel and the West.  And that means we're going to see plenty more books from Arabs with plenty of untruths in them.  And plenty of academic dishonesty that will damage entire disciplines and universities.  And plenty more one-star reviews by people such as me.	2004-11-14

So far, this one is the worst.<br /><br />We rely on what we read for information, so it isn't always easy to spot outright lies and omissions.  But it doesn't take long to see some of the problems with this book.<br /><br />One example is the visit of Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount.  Here's something we can check up on rather easily.  Read what Swisher says and compare it with historical truth.  It's way off.<br /><br />Or read what Swisher has to say about Jewish and Arab settlements in the disputed West Bank.<br /><br />This book appears to imply that what the world needs to do is comply with every whim of the more radical Arabs.  That, and only that, will bring \\"peace.\\"  But that's insane.  Suppose we complied with every whim of the Mafia, or the Ku Klux Klan?<br /><br />My point is not that Swisher is showing bias.  It is that he's misleading everyone.  No matter what we want, and no matter what our goals happen to be, we're better off with truth than with lies.

Some of these problems have been most obvious in high-profile cases, but that in no way means that the system is working for low-profile ones, as Rothwax shows.<br /><br />Rothwax starts by making a very strong point.  The main problem is that criminal justice rarely involves a search for the truth.  It is all well and good to discuss police misconduct or various extenuating factors, but none of this is proper until you answer what ought to be the very first question: did the defendant commit the crime?  If you get that answer right, you can try to make a just ruling.  If you can't get that one right, that is a big problem.<br /><br />And in some cases, the evidence of guilt is simply suppressed.  How can that help us produce justice?<br /><br />One very good recommendation that Rothwax makes is to have defendents come up with their side of the story in a sealed envelope.  Defendants would not be required to do this: they'd need to do it only if they wanted to see the prosecution's case via pretrial discovery.  As things stand, they change their stories to fit the prosecution case.  As Rothwax says, they'll start with \\"I wasn't there!\\"  And when the prosecution has a video to disprove that, they'll say \\"It was self-defence!\\"  And when the prosecution proves that the victim had no weapon, they'll say \\"I was crazy!\\"  Stories are concocted to fit the facts the prosecution has discovered.  The Menendez and O. J. Simpson trials are dramatic examples of this.<br /><br />Rothwax's point is simple: \\"truth must be the goal of any rational procedural system.\\"<br /><br />Next we get to laws about search and seizure.  These are shown to be hopelessly confusing, particularly when it is vehicles that are being searched or seized.  Rothwax says that we should get rid of the mandatory \\"exclusionary rule,\\" and replace it by a reasonableness criterion, as is done in Germany, for example.<br /><br />The Miranda rule is discussed after that.  While it has been useful in some cases to avoid having people get browbeaten into confessing to crimes, it is sometimes wrongfully applied to voluntary confessions.  Once again, the first question ought to be: did the defendant commit the crime?  If we answer that one correctly, we can proceed from there.  We may even let a guilty person go free because the police mistreated him, but it ought to be with the full legal knowledge that he committed the crime he was accused of.  Rothwax points out that the effect of Miranda is to say to a defendant \\"I urge you not to confess.\\"  It helps make trials a kind of game in which any defendant always has a sporting chance to escape, and that is quite a ways from truth or justice.<br /><br />Two more points that Rothwax makes include the fact that peremptory challenges of jurors should be disallowed (they tend to result in stacking the jury), and that juries should be told to regard the refusal of a defendant to testify to explain what would normally be considered evidence against him as indicating the truth of that evidence.<br /><br />But perhaps the best point of all that the author makes is that juries simply are very poor determiners of truth.<br /><br />The Miranda rule is discussed after that.

There's no problem with them.  Only there may be with my review, given that I read \\"Twilight,\\" Saint Augustine's \\"Confessions,\\" and \\"The Anti-Christ\\" in that order.  It's not a good combination.  And it may have motivated my negative (and now deleted) review of the \\"Confessions.\\"  You see, I'd just had Nietzsche explain to me that \\"the complete woman perpetrates literature in the same way that she perpetrates a little sin.\\"  Nietzsche takes a while to get used to.<br /><br />In \\"Twilight,\\" Nietzsche makes the point that there are four great logical errors:  confusion of cause and consequence, false causality, imaginary causes, and free will.  His illustration of the first is the claim that virtue causes happiness.<br /><br />Another fine point is made in reference to liberal causes.  While they are being fought for, they often promote freedom.  But once they are attained, there is a restoration of the herd mentality, and freedom is a thing of the past at best.  And one final point right before I read the \\"Confessions\\": \\"nothing is rarer among moralists and saints than integrity.\\"<br /><br />In \\"The Anti-Christ,\\" Nietzsche strongly condemns Christianity.  Nietzsche soon makes an important point which I happen to disagree with.  He says that in condemning Christianity, he does not want to \\"wrong a kindred religion,\\" namely Buddhism.  After all, Buddhism's \\"supreme goal is cheerfulness, stillness, absence of malice, and this goal is achieved.\\"  He's right about Buddhism's goal, and he's right that it is achieved.  But I think he's wrong about this being completely desirable: I think it removes so much emotion that it takes away some of what makes being human worthwhile.<br /><br />Nietzsche is outraged by the fact that Christians have made a hero of Jesus, and uses words to describe it such as \\"an instinctive hatred of reality.\\"  He analyzes Christianity from this point of view: as a constant opponent of truth.  And he concludes that it has caused distress, and that it has been a conspiracy against health, beauty, bravery, intellect, and life itself.<br /><br />I think those who have a vague feeling that monotheistic attitudes are a natural part of the human spirit ought to read this book.that it has caused distress, and that it has been a conspiracy against health, beauty, bravery, intellect, and life itself.

And you are using some standard text such as Halzen and Martin (also a book that has aged very well).

It is for the Feynman Lectures on Computation!  And that is an excellent book which is very useful (although probably insufficient) for anyone taking (or teaching) a class on the theory of computation.<br /><br />This book is quite different.  It's a collection of intriguing articles, as well as some reminiscences about Richard Feynman.  Feynman had a tendency to tell fascinating stories.  It was part and parcel of his style.  And it's generally fun to see more of his stories and more stories about him.<br /><br />The book is divided into five parts.  The first is related to the Feynman course on computation.  It includes a nice article on neural networks by John Hopfield (I wish some of this material had been put into the \\"lectures on computation\\" book!).  And an interesting article showing that the motion of Pluto is chaotic.  The next section is on reducing the size of computers, which includes scaling of MOS technology and theoretical limits on size reduction.  After that comes the \\"quantum\\" section.

But how is it doing overall?<br /><br />One might think that the trend is positive for most Muslim nations.  After all, as Lewis shows us at the start of his book, the past few decades have seen an end to imperialism.  The nations of north Africa are free.  So are Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Qatar, Bahrain, and several former members of the Soviet Union.  And the value of Arab oil has made many Muslim nations rich.<br /><br />On the other hand, we've also seen the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001.  If Islam is going to get into a war with the West, that is indeed a problem.  Even if there is merely a continuation of terror, we'll all be regarding Muslims with increased suspicion.  And those of us who have Muslim friends and relatives, or are Muslims ourselves, will sense this suspicion, in some cases first-hand.  Is terror an integral part of Islam?  If not, what can be done to dissociate Islam from it?<br /><br />Lewis explains that Islamic nations are typically more religious than nominally Christian ones.  And Islam is going through a period in which some radical elements are finding great fault with foreign societies, and want to fight them.<br /><br />Lewis makes an interesting point.  While we may see Usama Bin Laden's attacks on us as a desperate attack against the world's biggest military power, al-Qaeda did not see it quite that way.  Instead, they saw the United States as too morally corrupt and militarily enfeebled to fight back hard enough to win.  This contempt for the United States was in part due to our failure to protect the Shah of Iran when he was threatened by Islamic radicals (followed by allowing people from our embassy to be held hostage for over a year).  American tolerance and support for many Arab dictators has not helped us in this regard.<br /><br />Lewis then addresses three major issues: lack of modernity in Islamic nations, the influence of Wahhabi teaching, and the rise of terrorism.<br /><br />The lack of modernity is realized by most people in the Islamic world.  They know they are falling way behind the West in gross national products and in scientific contributions.  And some want to modernize and become more competitive.  But others see modernity as the problem.  These include the Wahhabis, a reactionary group that preach a radical version of Islam and use vast oil revenues to advertise.  And this has led to much of the terrorism we see from radical Islamists at present.<br /><br />Lewis explains that for these terrorists, the slaughter of civilians who appear to be bystanders is not collateral damage: these people are the main targets.  On top of that, counterattacks against the terrorists, who carefully hide themselves among Muslim civilians, make it appear that both sides are killing civilians and allows those who want to be misled to see the issues falsely.<br /><br />While Lewis does not see the radicals as being representative of Islam, he does see them as having a major effect on Arab politics.  Arab media have tended to report on the events of 9/11 much as they do about the slaughter of Jews in World War 2: it never happened, it was greatly exaggerated, it was deserved, and it's a shame it wasn't even worse.  While Arab media aren't yet saying that the World Trade Center wasn't knocked down, they do say that Arabs couldn't have done it.  And while they very rarely say that America deserved worse, they often say that we brought it on ourselves.<br /><br />The most interesting part was having Lewis remind us of what the radicals demand from us.  They insist that we embrace Islam, stop our, um, oppression, lies, immorality, and debauchery, and admit that we have neither principles nor manners.  In addition, we have to take their side in their wars against Israel, India (Kashmir), Russia (Chechnya), and the Philippines.  On top of that, we are to get our people out of their lands, end our support for corrupt Arab leaders, and be nice to the radicals.<br /><br/>They're not called radicals for nothing, are they?<br /><br />Luckily, there are many Muslims who have a very different point of view, and see America not as demonic but as a land \\"of human rights, of free institutions, and of a responsible and representative government.\\"<br /><br />This is why Lewis concludes that Islam is in crisis.  If the radicals manage to become accepted as the leaders of Islam, they and we are headed for serious trouble.  If the radicals fail, we in the West will find these nations to be true allies and friends.  In any case, the choice the Islamic world makes is very important for all of us and especially for the Muslims themselves.<br /><br />I think everyone ought to read this book.y, there are many Muslims who have a very different point of view, and see America not as demonic but as a land \\"of human rights, of free institutions, and of a responsible and representative government.\\"      This is why Lewis concludes that Islam is in crisis.

The volume and charge associated with a memory or logic bit has thus been reduced.  But there's a problem: at some point, a single cosmic ray can act as a signal to flip a bit.  And that point has long since been reached for heavy-ion cosmic rays.  Luckily, devices on the surface of the Earth are shielded by the atmosphere from most of these, except for the less-dangerous protons.  However, that still puts space-borne chips at risk, as well as chips on Earth that are susceptible to protons.  For the past 25 years or more, these bit flips have been called \\"single-event upsets\\" or simply \\"SEUs.\\"  This book shows how to analyze the problems these cosmic rays present.  It's an excellent textbook, with good sets of problems at the end of each chapter (and answers at the end of the book).<br /><br />The book starts with some important preliminary material on flux, fluence, current density, and cross-sections, as well as some valuable basics on chord distribution functions.  Those chord distributions come in handy when you want to know how much energy particles will deposit in the SEU-sensitive region.  Next is a chapter about the enemy: the nature, distribution, and flux of extraterrestrial SEU-inducing particles.  After that, there's a discussion of the amount of energy deposition per unit track length, which leads to an explanation of linear energy transfer (LET).  That leads to the introduction of a fundamental concept in SEU error-rate calculations, the Heinrich curve, which shows the distribution of cosmic rays by LET.  It also warns the reader about placing too much reliance on this curve: SEU cross-sections can vary with ion type, high-energy ions are more dangerous than low-energy ones, even if both have the same LET, the energy lost by a particle may not all go into the nearby SEU-sensitive region, there are variances in the amount of energy deposited, additional energy can be pulled into the sensitive region by \\"funneling,\\" and there may need to be corrections for cosmic-ray showering.<br /><br />After that comes a chapter on how to test devices for SEU susceptibility, using accelerators such as Brookhaven or simply exposing them to Californium-252.  These tests not only look at bit flips, but also at \\"latchup,\\" which can cause permanent damage to a device if it is left powered on.<br /><br />Next there is a detailed discussion of SEU rates (and techniques for computing them) for a wide variety of particle environments: geosynchronous altitudes, the Van Allen belt, neutrons at aircraft cruising altitudes, the South Atlantic anomaly, and sea level.<br /><br />Well, what is to be done about all these problems?  The authors finish by discussing shielding, circuitry-hardening, redundancy, scrubbing, error detection, and error correction to reduce or counter bit errors.  That requires a discussion of multiple-bit upsets as well.<br /><br />This is a very useful book for anyone who has to deal with such problems, especially in the design of space-borne systems.gy deposited, additional energy can be pulled into the sensitive region by \\"funneling,\\" and there may need to be corrections for cosmic-ray showering.  <br /> <br />After that comes a chapter on how to test devices for SEU susceptibility, using accelerators such as Brookhaven or simply exposing them to Californium-252.

This book is not so much about doing practical quantum mechanical calculations as with the interpretation of quantum theory.  As Griffiths says, you can't use it alone as a primary text to learn quantum mechanics: you'll need a separate text to cover blackbody radiation, the photoelectric effect, atomic spectra, the hydrogen atom, harmonic oscillators, perturbation theory, and the like.<br /><br />When quantum mechanics was developed, it gave such good results that people often overlooked the difficulties with connecting the theory to physical reality.  Reality to them consisted of actual measurements.  And so the notion grew that measurements were an integral part of the theory, and that measurements affected what was thought of as physical reality, even non-locally.  When students looked puzzled, their teachers merely reminded them that reality is weird!  Well, sure, reality is a little strange, but there is never a need to describe reality in a self-inconsistent manner.<br /><br />The problems came with concepts such as \\"collapse of the wavefunction.\\"  That is, we'd measure a property (say, the x-polarization) of some particle.  And the nature of a faraway linked particle would appear to change, instantly.  That's a non-local effect: it travels faster than light.  And if that effect were genuine, it would permit sending signals backwards in time.<br /><br />The associated problem was with measurement: the existence of an observer appeared to change reality.<br /><br />Worse, these complaints struck right at the core of quantum mechanics, whose proponents boasted about the importance of \\"looking at the fundamental laws\\" in a way \\"which makes their self-consistency obvious\\" (quoting from Dirac's quantum mechanics book).<br /><br />Those of us who read the excellent text, \\"The Feynman Lectures on Physics,\\" were taught that the following statement is false:  \\"you can not alter the physical nature of\\" (faraway) \\"photons by changing the kind of observation you make on your photons.\\"  And that just did not help.  In some sense, that statement must be not false, but true, to avoid the problems we just stated.<br /><br />Part of the reason for the confusion is that in most cases, making a measurement on a particle really does change the state of that particle.  But not always: repeated measurements of x-polarization simply verify the state rather than changing it.<br /><br />Now we have a book that explains how to make quantum theory self-consistent so we can avoid these problems.  It explains that wave function collapse is simply a calculational device, rather than a physical effect produced by a measurement.  It explicitly solves many famous quantum mechanics \\"paradoxes,\\" including the \\"Schrodinger cat,\\" the \\"Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox,\\" the \\"delayed choice paradox,\\" and the \\"Hardy paradox.\\"  It discusses Bell's inequalities, showing that actual quantum mechanics is indeed a local theory (yay!) while \\"hidden variable\\" alternatives are non-local!<br /><br />The key concept Griffiths introduces is the \\"consistent quantum framework\\" or \\"consistent quantum family.\\"  The idea is that there are multiple such frameworks, but accurate statements can be made only by choosing one of them and staying with it.<br /><br />Griffiths explains that the following are true both of classical and quantum mechanics: measurements play no fundamental role in either, both are local theories, and both are consistent with the notion of an independent reality.  However, there are some differences as well.  Quantum theory shows that physical objects never have completely precise positions or momentums.  The theory is stochastic, not deterministic, so we can't infer a unique future or past from the present.  And finally, and most important, there is no unique exhaustive description of a physical system or process.  \\"Instead, reality is such that it can be described in various alternative, incompatible ways, using descriptions which can not be combined orcompared.\\"<br /><br />This is a valuable book for every physics graduate student.can not be combined or compared.\\" <br /> <br />This is a valuable book for every physics graduate student. <br />	2004-11-11

For example, if I were teaching a class from this book, I'd take advantage of the special section on \\"building your own computer\\" in which one learns some machine-language programming and then creates a software simulation of a computer called \\"the Simpletron.\\"  I'd include the exercises where one builds a corresponding two-pass compiler (for a language called \\"Simple\\") and optimizes it, as well as the exercise to build an interpreter for it too.<br /><br />There's an enormous amount of material here.

It is almost all maps.<br /><br />The book starts with some maps that show the ancient borders of Israel.  That allows the reader to see what borders Diaspora Jews associated with the word \\"Israel.\\"  And in fact, one can see where in this region Jews tried to settle after being expelled from Spain and elsewhere near the end of the fifteenth century.<br /><br />Next it shows the places where Jews began settling starting with the advent of modern Zionism in around 1880.  I found this part fascinating.  The book explains that the Jews purchased their land from Turks and Arabs at high prices.  Given that, one can see the hypocrisy of Arabs complaining that the Jews stole their land, and that the land ought to be given to those who were the majority in 1880.  Even more interesting, Jews were easily the majority in what is now \\"East Jerusalem\\" in 1880, but very few Arabs would want to assign that land to Israel today: more likely they would complain that the place is being \\"judaized!\\"<br /><br />The book continues past World War 1, showing proposed boundaries of the region where Jewish settlement would be permitted and encouraged, promises made by Britain in order to acquire the Mandate over the area.  As we discover, Britain broke these promises to the Jews and to the international community, after Arab aggression against the Jews in 1920, 1921, 1929, and 1936-1939.  Gilbert is to be commended for giving a detailed accounting of the violence.<br /><br />The maps continue with great effect, showing all of Israel's wars and battles with Arab terrorism, along with borders suggested by various peace plans, right through Camp David and Taba in 2000.<br /><br />There are a few omissions in this book.  The most serious is simply leaving out the entire Jewish revolt against the British and their perfidious White Paper of 1939.  We don't see the routes of boats like the Patria or even the Exodus.  The omission is all the more serious given Gilbert's background in both British and Jewish history.  Of course, strictly speaking, these incidents were part of a conflict between Jews and British, not Jews and Arabs, but I think they are an integral part of the overall picture.<br /><br />Finally, a few maps are a little silly, such as showing the travels of US Secretaries of State Baker and Christopher in the Middle East in the early 1990s.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all in all, it is a wonderful resource and I highly recommend it.e serious given Gilbert's background in both British and Jewish history.

After all, Israel is a small nation.  What it does probably isn't very important.  Even if it were to do something drastically different, such as giving away most of its land, or starting a war with a neighbor, or forming a military alliance with Syria, one might wonder why that would be interesting.  Worse, Israel's options are heavily constrained: it is unlikely to do much of anything at all.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there's still quite a bit of value in these articles.  For one thing, while Israel's options may be limited, it's still worth trying to keep track of what is happening in the region and in the world.  A second point is that much of what is written about Israel is intentionally inaccurate, misleading, or simply thoughtless.  It's good to have someone around to provide some accuracy and clarity.  Finally, many of the problems we see in the Levant have larger implications, and this makes what Singer writes important for everyone.<br /><br />One theme of Singer's is the folly of \\"evenhandedness.\\"  That is, the European Union tends to support the Arabs in their war against Israel.  The United States purports to be a fair and honest broker that can bring peace to both sides.  Singer points out more than once that this doesn't work.  A neutral approach towards ending fights favors bullies.  After all, if the aggressor and the victim are to be treated equally, why not be an aggressor?  And this is in fact one of the reasons that we don't have serious progress towards peace between Israel and the Arabs.<br /><br />I liked the variety of subjects that Singer addressed and found his views thoughtful and interesting.  I recommend his book.	2004-11-10

But I think they tend to show not imagination and courage but poor intuition.<br /><br />Let's start with Van Flandern's idea that gravity propagates much faster than c, the speed of light.  That is, does the Sun pull you towards where it is, or to where it was 8 minutes ago?  I think Newton might well have agreed with Van Flandern's argument that were gravity to propagate at c, planetary orbits around the Sun would be gravitationally damped and unstable, and the Solar System would not exist.<br /><br />But this argument is false.  It is the same for electromagnetism. A charge moving at constant speed pulls you towards where it will be when the field reaches you.  A charge moving with constant velocity does not radiate: the lowest order radiation term is the dipole term, corresponding to an accelerating charge.  And gravitational radiation depends not on the dipole term, but the typically much smaller quadrupole term, which can become significant for a body with a changing acceleration.<br /><br />Examinations of binary pulsars have indicated that a quadrupole moment does indeed lead to a gravitational damping and orbit decay.  Not only that, the decay is consistent to within 1% of the speed of gravity equaling c.  I find that convincing.  Moreover, near-occultation observations of quasars may support this conclusion as well.  And on top of that, a speed of gravity greater than c would transmit a signal backwards in time.<br /><br />Van Flandern argues that there is nothing special about c, given that we use electromagnetic waves to measure time and length.  He's wrong.  As Swiatecki and others have illustrated, the constancy of c is a consequence of the local spacetime manifold.  Imagine a number of very thin boards with identical rectilinear grids and identical synchronized stopwatches fixed at all gridpoints on all boards.  Now let the boards slide around at varying speeds and directions.  Then smash one of the watches on the top board so hard that it stops all the watches directly beneath it.  Later, smash another one the same way.  You'll quickly discover the differential interval between spacetime events, and that will give you the value of c.  And we've found c without any reference to light or to Maxwell's equations.<br /><br />Van Flandern supports the \\"fission\\" theory for the origin of the Moon, rather than the \\"giant impact\\" theory.  While that's still possible, evidence is leaning heavily away from his idea.<br /><br />Now, what about a recently exploding planet creating the asteroid belt?  Well, sure, there are many asteroid orbits that are unstable over really long times.  But there's plenty of evidence that some asteroids have been around since the beginning of the solar system, and that what we're seeing is simply lots of collisions, not explosions.  Moreover, a recent explosion, without a clear mechanism no less, is a little provincial as a theory.<br /><br />The funny part is that there are some wild phenomena, such as planetary migrations, especially in other stellar systems, which do bear plenty of investigation.  We don't need to start by indulging in arbitrary and dubious speculations: explaining what's right in front of us is exciting enough!<br /><br />I think Van Flandern's comments about the \\"face on Mars\\" once again showed poor intuition.  That \\"face\\" looked awfully strongly like something with a natural origin.<br /><br />Van Flandern does not like the Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, which he feels disregards the need for an underlying reality behind all the concepts.  I think this actually may be a fair criticism, but there are alternative formulations of Quantum Mechanics which avoid such problems.<br /><br />Finally, Van Flandern goes after the Big Bang theory of the origin of our Universe.  I think that's a mistake.  The evidence is overwhelming that the Universe was once much denser and much, much hotter.  We see that from the Hubble expansion, from the 2.7 K blackbody radiation, and most important, from the helium percentages in the visible universe corresponding to Big Bang nucleosynthesis.  Complaining about the beryllium percentage is very poor intuition indeed: we'd still have that dense, hot universe just as the Big Bang says.  He'd have been better off attacking the Inflationary models of the early universe: these are still fair game.<br /><br />Um, it could be that the accelerating expansion of the universe is heading towards a singularity (called the \\"Big Rip\\") in a finite time.  Perhaps in a few billion years, spacetime will reach this.  In the final million years, the galaxies would disperse, including our Milky Way.  In the final months, our solar system would fly apart.  In the final hours, the Earth would disintegrate, as gravity would no longer bind it together.  At the end, all particles would explode as well.

Harris adds the question: are they dangerous?  And he shows that some of them are.<br /><br />I'm sure we've all heard that it is impolite and improper to challenge the religious views of our neighbors.  The implicit logic is that religious views are not harmful, thus there is no need to save others from being exposed them, even if they are potential falsehoods.  The author points out that some of these views are indeed dangerous.  He cites suicide bombings and shows that most of them are directly linked to irrational religious views.  He reminds us of the absurdity of having multitudes of people killed over differing versions of religious stories.  And he reminds us that this situation could be changed: we've given up alchemy.  Maybe we can give up religious wars too.<br /><br />A good argument Harris makes is this: many religious views are arbitrary.  If we all forgot all human knowledge tonight, we'd start to reconstruct it.  We'd learn how to find food and shelter.  And we'd slowly relearn fundamentals of science and engineering.  But most of the details of religious dogma would be lost.  His conclusion is that what we hold sacred is considered sacred only because it was considered sacred yesterday.<br /><br />The author's examples of the dangers of religion include witch hunts and blood libels.  And he cites frightening polls showing that well over half of the people in some Muslim nations now find suicide bombing defensible.  He shows that the risk of a catastrophe involving nuclear weapons is great if we stay on the present course.<br /><br />Harris takes on a number of people who have expressed themselves on these risks.  He demolishes Ed Said's claim that the al-Qaeda terrorists are simply a minor group of lunatics to be compared with Jim Jones' cult.  And while he agrees with Paul Berman on some points, he quite reasonably disagrees with Berman's characterization of al-Qaeda as \\"nihilists.\\"<br /><br />Harris concedes many of Noam Chomsky's claims about America having done many bad things in its history.  But he smashes Chomsky's omnipresent implication that killing two people as collateral damage in a successful defence of hundreds of innocents is twice as bad as simply murdering one innocent person out of malice.<br /><br />I was glad to see Harris reject the \\"pacifist\\" refusal to fight against thugs.  Mahatma Gandhi recommended that Jews protest the German Nazis by mass suicides (he also recommended that the Jews accept all Arab demands involving Levantine land).  Harris points out that taken to such extremes, such refusal to oppose evil is simply dangerous.<br /><br />Another target of Harris' words are the moral relativists.  He asks if we can say that those who commit \\"honor killings\\" of shamed wives, sisters, and daughters really are showing less love for their womenfolk than do men who do not subscribe to such murderous behavior.  His answer is: of course we can.<br /><br />On issues of genocide and torture, Harris is quick to point out that if we are to judge these on moral grounds, we must judge on the basis of how much suffering we actually cause, not on how much we appear to cause.  Killing one person up close looks horrible.  Murdering a million people from afar by pushing a button may look much less vile.  And one widely reported death can draw far more worldwide concern than a million unreported ones.  But the one million deaths are still the more serious problem.<br /><br />Are we in the United States safe from the problems of monotheistic religion?  Not necessarily.  Harris reminds us that candidates who reject religion don't have a, um, prayer when it comes to getting elected.  And that is perhaps the only actual test many of our politicians face: there are no qualification exams to pass to let them run for office.  Harris also describes the religious nature of statements by people such as Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia, and the effect of religious sentiments on national decisions involving stem cell research.<br /><br />Harris concludes that we need to dispense not with all mysticism and customs, but with faith.  And that can be done in a single generation \\"if parents and teachers would merely give honest answers to the questions of every child.\\"  To Harris, the most sacred thing is truth.  And the risks we face if we maintain the status quo include religious wars.<br /><br />This is a powerful and important book, and we ought to read it and recommend it to others.ng stem cell research.

And you can learn it from this book.  Some of the material isn't all that recent, but much of it doesn't need to be.<br /><br />35 years ago, if one were teaching a course on the theory of computation, I'd have recommended Minsky's book (it came out in 1967).  That was a great text.  Nowadays, there are numerous choices.  But one could still use books that originally came out well before Feynman's notes, such as Lewis & Papadimitriou or Hopcroft, Motwani, and Ullman.<br /><br />The question boils down to the quality of what is in the book, as well as what material it has that other books do not, and what material it is missing that most other texts have.<br /><br />This book is quite readable and preserves much of Feynman's teaching style.  So let's look at what it is missing.  First, it doesn't talk much about real neurons.  Of course, even Minsky doesn't dwell much on that, and other computation books avoid that topic too.  But now, there's a more serious omission.  Feynman spends something like two pages on grammars!  If you were using Lewis and Papadimitriou (first edition) there would be a chapter of over 70 pages on context-free languages alone.  As a teacher or a student, would you really want to miss all that?<br /><br />No, as a student, you would have to read up on all that material elsewhere.  And as a teacher, you would have to use another book or write your own notes.  That material is too much a part of most required curricula.<br /><br />But that doesn't take away from the value of the book when it comes to the rest of the material.  And the final four chapters, which discuss coding and information theory, reversible computation and the thermodynamics of computing, quantum mechanical computers, and some physical aspects of computation, are all useful material that you often won't see in other computation texts.<br /><br />As a student, I'd read the book.

After a few paragraphs, I wondered if I were reading a parody.  I was shocked that Commentary had published something that merely substituted insults for facts and logic.<br /><br />Of course, there were letters to the editor.  Including a half-page one from Paul Gross.  He rightly asked, referring to Berlinski's article, \\"How could Commentary not have let some biologist read it\\" (after which, one would hope, there was no way Commentary would have published it).  He mentioned that he didn't have the space to refute all of Berlinski's unsupported or dead-wrong assertions in a short letter.  I'm happy to report that he and Barbara Forrest have now taken the time and trouble to refute the Intelligent Designers in a full length book.<br /><br />Still, as Forrest and Gross explain, the main problem is not with the content of the Intelligent Design arguments.  It is with the lack of content.  I was to discover this eight years ago when I read Berlinski's response to the letters to the editor.  Berlinski spent over a page replying to Gross.  No problem with that.  The problem was that Berlinski didn't address the points Gross had made.  And I finally realized that Berlinski had done this intentionally, simply writing down words that gave a vague appearance of having something to do with the topic but did not in fact counter any arguments.<br /><br />The authors make this fundamental point about the \\"intelligent designers\\" (the \\"Wedge\\").  The Wedge has substituted public relations for facts and for logical arguments.  As Forrest and Gross quite properly put it, \\"The issue is not Darwinism or science: the issue is the Wedge itself.\\"<br /><br />According to the authors, the Wedge seeks to do something other than challenge a debateable set of scientific assertions.  It is trying \\"to overthrow the system of rules and procedures of modern science and those intellectual footings of our culture laid down in the Enlightenment.\\"<br /><br />I agree with Forrest and Gross that what we need is not so much a debate about Darwinian evolution: the authors answer the critics, but that topic was put to bed in any scientific sense of the term many decades ago.  What we all need to address is what to do about the threat of public policy on scientific matters being determined on grounds which are entirely divorced from any semblence of scientific knowledge.

Well, it's a wide open question.  As Popa tells us, an explanation that is missing a critical step won't do.  There are plenty of clues.  But Popa shows us that there are still many approaches to putting the clues together.<br /><br />There are plenty of approaches that are being pursued today.  Popa tells us about many of them.  Still, let's remind ourselves of some of them.  One is to look for fossil evidence and DNA evidence of our earliest ancestors.  Say that these turn out to be hyperthermophiles.  Use that information, as well as the stability properties of RNA and DNA, to deduce the environment life originated in.  A second idea is to look at the way we synthesize RNA (or DNA) today.  Use that information to speculate about how the first RNA and DNA evolved.  A third idea is to look at the self-assembly properties of entities for clues.  A fourth idea is to note the similarity of ATP and the nucleic acid adenine.  Assume this is no coincidence!  A fifth idea is to do all sorts of experiments with collections of monomers and see if they arrange themselves into replicating strings.  A sixth idea is to concentrate on computer simulations of all this.  Computer simulations of the origin of replication show that there are some dangers, such as the \\"selfish RNA catastrophe,\\" the \\"short-circuit catastrophe,\\" the \\"population collapse catastrophe,\\" and simply the risk of too many replication errors.  Draw conclusions from the fact that these hazards were successfully avoided.  A seventh idea is to at least answer the question of what came first, replication, metabolism, or cellularization.  And so on.  It seems that there is a great deal we aren't at all sure of.<br /><br />Popa starts with the issue of the issue of the development of cellularization, metabolism, and replication.  He asserts that since all are needed for life, they must have evolved together, not serially.  He states that the ATP coincidence probably is unimportant, with ATP's use as an energy carrier being a late development.  And he takes on the mathematical modelers by stating that they generally omit first order effects by not tracing the energy flow and the degradation of the evolving entities.<br /><br />The issues Popa dwells on most are the energy sources, bioinformation, chirality, and the origin of specificity (as opposed to \\"metabolism\\" or \\"homeostasis\\").  Of these, the part on chirality was the most interesting to me.  Popa discusses the implication that life's chirality implies the existence of some large-scale chiral driver, such as rotating vortices or asymmetries in right and left circularly polarized light.<br /><br />There's also quite a bit of useful material about the definition of life.  Popa is right to make the point that \\"life\\" and \\"living entities\\" are not at all synonymous.<br /><br />Anyway, it is an interesting book about a tough problem: I'm glad I can just read about it and don't have to solve it!gy carrier being a late development.

There will be some books about bridge matches, showing how some great players made some great plays (often as declarer).  There will be some books on bidding systems and conventions.  Some books on declarer play.  And, of course, not even last and certainly not least, a few books about defense.  But even these books are often oriented towards individual defensive skills.  They are geared towards the player who can walk into a game and score well with a pickup partner.<br /><br />But that leaves out the partnership aspect of the game.<br /><br />Many of the books that emphasize partnership deal primarily with what system to play, what conventions to play, and how to test one's partnership's ability to arrive at good contracts.<br /><br />However, there's a big need to defend well.  That means agreeing on what signals are to be used and when they are to be used, and it means practicing them!  And this well-written book will be of good use for your partnership if you go through it together.	2004-11-08

You won't learn how to play go or even develop a style to playing the game from a book, any book.  You'll learn it from playing the game.<br /><br />But start here, just to learn the rules and learn what the game is all about.<br /><br />After that, I do NOT recommend games against other people right away.  The people you play will be so strong that you'll just get frustrated, or they'll be so weak that you won't learn much, win or lose.  And the games will be slow and boring.  Instead, get some go computer program (preferably one that lets you take back bad moves) and learn to smash the computer, first with 9x9 games, then with 13x13 games, and then with 19x19 games.  Throw in some handicap stones, too!<br /><br />Then read this book again.  And maybe try Janice Kim's set of introductory books next, and some of the books of graded go problems.  Then try your skills against some human opponents of about 8-kyu strength.	2004-11-08

Not all of them.  There isn't much on strength of materials, for example.  This book concentrates on the fundamental issues of how much power it takes to fly and what size a flying machine ought to be to make optimal use of its power.  What makes the book so much fun is the inclusion of flight characteristics of birds and insects.<br /><br />Tennekes starts with a chart of weight versus cruising speed for the insects, birds, and planes.  Next, he discusses wing sizes.  Then fuel consumption, strategies for takeoffs and landings, and gliding.<br /><br />The author concludes with some praise for the design of the Boeing 747.  All commercial passenger planes are best off flying as fast as possible without getting too near the speed of sound, so Mach 0.9 is best.  These planes are best off flying high enough to take advantage of the cooler air and good weather: a height of 10 kilometers is ideal.  To match the cruising speed with the optimal wing loading at that height, one gets an airplane which is roughly the size and shape of a Boeing 747.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-11-08

The translation is okay, although I think it would have been even better to be less literal and more readable.<br /><br />And yes, Julian's arguments aren't all that bad against Christianity.  But what do you expect?  Christianity was never designed to win an argument against anyone who happened to be rich, intelligent, or educated: it was a religion that excluded such people.  Given all that, I'm surprised that what we're seeing from Julian wasn't more powerful.<br /><br />Still, I think we ought to read this book, if only to see the opportunity Pagans now have to make large numbers of converts today.  Christianity had no arguments against Paganism at the time of Julian, and we can see from this book that it still doesn't.	2004-11-07

This is a great book that describes where we stand in the search for neuronal correlates of consciousness (NCC).  The problem has been attacked by people from various different fields.  Still, it has to be a biology problem.  Consciousness clearly resides in the brain. If only we had plenty of examples of brain-damaged people ... some of whom clearly lacked consciousness, some who were almost conscious, some who were certainly conscious, some who were uncertainly conscious .... then maybe we'd work out what the key was.  Luckily, we don't have all that many brain-damaged subjects.<br /><br />Koch takes this sort of approach to the problem of discovering the NCC: he tries \\"to quantitatively correlate the receptive field properties of individual neurons to conscious perception.\\"  If there's no map between certain cells and the structure of a conscious perception, then it's unlikely that these cells are sufficient for that conscious percept.  That means looking at what we'd normally think of as vision problems, optical illusions, attention loss, long and short term memory, and various automatic and semi-automatic responses to stimuli.  What amazed me most was that the work on this subject is still easily readable by the layman.<br /><br />One of the more interesting questions Koch raises is this: since consciousness resides in the brain, do we get two consciousnesses when we split the brain in two?  Actually, (as Koch explains) this was studied by Roger Sperry, whose split-brain experiments on monkeys and other animals in the 1950s and 1960s showed that the two sides of the brain easily learn different responses to stimuli, indicating that these animals effectively possess two separate minds.  There are, of course, as Koch describes, some human split-brain patients who also demonstrate this.<br /><br />It's an interesting book that is easy to read.  It's sobering to realize how little progress we've made on such a fundamental question.	2004-11-07

After a brief history of ancient Israel, it pinpoints the start of modern Zionism with the assassination of the Russian Czar Alexander II in 1881.  The bulk of the book traces the history of Zionism from then until the founding of the state of Israel in 1948 and its victory in its War of Independence.  The book concludes with a short description of Modern Israel and its more recent history.<br /><br />To the book's credit, it explains that Israel now faces a propaganda war from the Arabs, including oft-repeated Big Lies to the effect that Zionism is a form of racism and that Israel has deprived Arabs of their rights.  Future authors of histories of Israel ought to read this book and try to at least do as well!	2004-11-07

However, in the past one or two centuries, the Western world was no longer willing to accept the Arab argument that oppressing Jews was a Divine Right of all Arabs.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Arabs have plenty of oil which the West wants.  That put enormous pressure on Arabs to tell lies about the Middle East.  All sorts of arbitrary lies, no matter how absurd!  The idea was to say that the Jews are the oppressors, or that the Jews don't want to live in the Middle East, or that there are no Jews, or that there were never any Jews in the Middle East in the past, or that Jerusalem wasn't Jewish, or that the Arabs never oppressed Jews.  Or that there is a special Levantine Arab people that can live only on Jewish land and nowhere else.  Anything, anything, just to get Western support.  And many in the West are begging the Arabs to tell these lies, just so that they can thereby have an excuse to support the Arabs against Israel and get more Arab oil.<br /><br />That's why there are so many non-stop Arab lies about the Middle East, and why so many of these lies are propagated by the United Nations, not just by the Arabs.  And that's why there aren't anywhere near as many Israeli lies.  As a matter of fact, given that the Arabs are lying so much, many Israelis are simply settling for the truth.<br /><br />But there can't be any genuine peace built on a foundation of these malicious lies.<br /><br />That's what makes this book so valuable.  If we want peace, we need to start with some truth.  And this book lists many \\"popular\\" arbitrary lies about the Arab war on Israel and simply states the facts that these lies need to be replaced with.  If you aren't aware of some of these facts, you ought to get the book.  And if you are aware of them, you still ought to read it so that you can recommend it to others.	2004-11-07

Okay, let's say for the sake of argument that this is true.<br /><br />Zionism is merely Jewish nationalism.  It means human rights for everyone, including Jews.  Antizionism means opposition to human rights for Levantine Jews.<br /><br />Antizionism is a consistent position to have, but it is arbitrary and racist.  And it opposes human rights.<br /><br />There are three reasons why one might want to be an antizionist anyway.  The first is that one might feel that Jews are just too different to be admitted to human society.  A second reason is that there is a war going on against the Jews that may be worth fighting out of considerations of loyalty to one's friends, no matter how wicked and racist it is.  A third reason is that it is fun to tell lies and slander, rob, mistreat, and bully people, especially when it seems that you can get away with it.<br /><br />Very few people have the first attitude.  The second attitude does not require lying about the past and present.  The third attitude includes lies and taunts as part of the package.  It wouldn't be any fun without constant lies.  And the books that have a \\"bias\\" against Zionism are almost all representative of this point of view.  Believe me, you do not want any of them, even if you are an antizionist.  You want the truth no matter who you may be.<br /><br />You may think you can find a good book in the second category: the truth from a racist opponent of human rights.  Good luck.  For example, try \\"Bitter Harvest\\" by Sami Hadawi.  It leaves out the entire Jewish point of view, already a big omission.  On top of that, it includes a number of absurd and arbitrary lies that result in some serious self-inconsistencies in his tale.<br /><br />The reason that some (not all) of the pro-Zionist books on the subject are much closer to truth than the anti-Zionist ones is that most anti-Zionists have simply abandoned truth in an effort to get support from people who think they support human rights.<br /><br />That is why you want Bard's book as an introduction.  This will give you a good foundation in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  And after reading it, yes, you'll want to look at some other material to see a wide variety of viewpoints.  But you'll never want to read something composed of pure lies which are written only to lure supporters of human rights into supporting racist opponents of those rights.  And starting with the facts in Bard's book will help you avoid that.most anti-Zionists have simply abandoned truth in an effort to get support from people who think they support human rights. <br /> <br />That is why you want Bard's book as an introduction.

It gets headlines.  It gets sympathetic treatment in the press.  It gets appeased.<br /><br />The most obvious example of this is Arab terror against Israel.  If Israelis get killed, there is immediate worldwide support for terror, not for Israel.  If Arabs get killed, there is immediate worldwide support for terror, not Israel.  The terrorist argument that terror pays seems unrefutable in this case.  Unless, of course, the terrorists get defeated militarily some day.  Dershowitz explains this very well, with charts showing the connection between Arab terrorism and international appeasement of the terrorists.<br /><br />Some say that the Jews deserve terror.  But I think they are missing the point.  The issue has to be the terrorists, not the victims.  Sure, the Jews killed Jezebel.  So what?  Yes, the Jews who fought at Masada may or may not have been all that nice.  So what?  And yes, even in the 1940s, some Jews fought against the British occupiers of their land.  Again, so what?  The point is that the present Arab terrorists are not choosing terrorism as a last, desperate measure.  It's their first choice.  Dershowitz does a good job of showing this.<br /><br />Dershowitz does discuss measures that can be taken against terrorism.  Here, I think some of what he says is speculative.  But the main point of the book is that we need to stop terror from paying.  If we can learn just this one lesson that Dershowitz is teaching us, I think the rest of the problems will be much easier to solve.	2004-11-06

But it does serve to show why many Arabs and Jews are at odds not only with each other, and not only with their compatriots, but also with many of the people from outside the region who purport to give them advice.<br />Most of what is in the book is well-known history and would be unremarkable were it not for some incredible fabrications in books by people such as Shahak, Chomsky, Finkelstein, Pappe, Hirst, and Said.  Probably the contamination of the international information supply with these ad hoc antizionist untruths is a more serious aspect of the Arab war against Israel than the actual terror and aggression.  For that reason, a book such as this one is a good place to start to try to learn something about the problem.	2004-11-06

Are we getting our money's worth?<br /><br />Well, the first issue is political bias.  Jarvik shows that there's plenty of that.  William Buckley has been the token conservative: we've always known that.  There are enough clearly political shows so that a little more equal representation, given that the public is paying for it, would be in order.<br /><br />Still, there is one truly frightening example of bad journalism that I think casts even more doubt on PBS, namely its treatment of the Arab war on Israel.  Jarvik shows that PBS is indeed guilty as charged of prevarications, outright falsehoods, and contempt for journalistic ethics.  It simply churns out anti-Israeli propaganda.  And if is willing to do all this just to hurt a few Jews, we can only wonder what other lies it's telling us.

Now \\"Ibn Warraq\\" and others give us an interesting view of the objections to Islam by those who have basically abandoned it.<br /><br />Ibn Warraq starts by making the point that it can be dangerous to leave Islam.  Doing so makes one an apostate.  Apostasy generally carries a death penalty, especially for men.  And even for those who survive, it often results in the forfeiture of one's possessions and legal rights.<br /><br />Nevertheless, some people do leave Islam.  My own ancestors did so over a hundred years ago.  And as this book mentions, some leave it in favor of polytheism, especially in Indonesia.  Or for Christianity.  But the main thrust of the book is to describe something about those former Muslims who have simply abandoned religion in general and why.<br /><br />The main reasons for abandoning Islam have turned out to be its irrationality, its immorality (especially the treatment of Women), and the personal life of the Prophet.<br /><br />Others have reacted negatively to the fanaticism and aggression of many Muslims, as well as to the increasing lack of economic competetiveness of Muslim portion of the world.<br /><br />There were a few unusual points made in the book.  One was simply that apostasy is not really applicable to Buddhism, let alone most polytheistic religions.  Another was that if we humans were in need of divine guidance 15 or 20 centuries ago, surely we are in at least as much need of it now: why are there supposedly no more prophets to supply that guidance?<br /><br />Another point is that Western media are prone to publishing pro-Islamic material.  This is explained simply: Islam is in the news, so the media have to say something about it.  And the media are reluctant to say anything negative for fear of being called Islamophobic.<br /><br />One of the writers in the book points out that some of the articles about Islam generated by those who have abandoned it are virtually a mirror image of traditional apologetics for Islam.  Is it proper to write so vehemently?  The conclusion is that while vehemence often obscures otherwise sound arguments, vehement essays often make valuable points too.<br /><br />The book concludes with some useful references to the Koran and on the life of the Prophet, followed by a list of websites critical of Islam and some books critical of Islam.<br /><br />This book is interesting and worth reading.

Most of Cioran's works have indeed been re-released recently.  Unfortunately, this one has not been.  And that is a shame given the power of the title essay.  The other essays are okay.  But the title article is the best.<br /><br />I doubt that I have ever read a better 16-page essay than \\"The New Gods.\\"  Its marvellous prose shines through everywhere.  When I read that Saint Gregory's oration against Julian the apostate \\"makes you feel like then and there converting to paganism,\\" my jaw dropped.  I got a copy of that oration right away!<br /><br />Cioran explains that early Christian apologetics are simply a set of libels camouflaged as treatises.  But there was one thing that made Christianity different: hatred.  Without that hatred, this new religion would merely have traded in \\"the old gods for a nailed corpse.\\"<br /><br />Cioran is not the first to criticize Christianity.  But he then goes on to defend Paganism.  He explains that under Paganism, fervor is shared among Goddesses and Gods.  Only under monotheism does this fervor degrade into faith and aggression.  People, being capricious, would shift from one God to another if given the chance.  And Pagan Goddesses and Gods do not demand to be worshipped, just respected: in general, one does not kneel before them but merely hails them.<br /><br />As Cioran states, the human soul is naturally Pagan.  And thus he has a conclusion: we humans will return to Paganism.  The only thing Christianity had going for it was hatred, and that is no longer going to be there to sustain it.  We'll ask the Goddesses and Gods to return to us.  And maybe we'll even stop the bizarre Christian practice of burying the dead in broad daylight.	2004-11-05

This book does a great job of answering some of these questions.<br /><br />The thesis of the book is that in some matters, there are close relations between the U. S. and Israel.  But Sohar's analogy is to the way a man might behave towards a concubine, providing her with \\"a cozy apartment, nice furniture, and a comfortable bed.\\"  The concubine's \\"true well-being and her future\\" are \\"a matter of less concern.\\"<br /><br />Israel's help to America is explained in detail, including its victories over Soviet-supplied forces and capture of advanced Soviet weapons (which were then transferred to the United States).<br /><br />Perhaps the best part of the book is its explanation of just how much aid America gives to Europe, Israel, and East Asia.  Starting in 1974, we gave Israel hundreds of millions of dollars every year in military aid.  Since 1986, we've been giving Israel 3 billion dollars per year.  That sounds like an enormous sum of money.  1.8 billion dollars is for military aid (400 million dollars in money and 1.4 million dollars worth of American arms), while 1.2 billion is to pay off debt on American loans.  Still, even in 1986, this amounted to less than 2% of Israel's Gross Domestic Product, and the percentage has been dropping.<br /><br />How big is this number?  Well, compare it to the aid we give via NATO and other alliances.  Western Europe, in the same time period, got 170 billion dollars per year.  East Asia (Japan and Korea) received another 70 billion per year.  That puts the aid to Israel in perspective.  I think this explanation alone makes this book worth reading.  But read the rest of it as well.	2004-11-05

But after the Warren Commission report came out, even I had a couple of doubts.<br /><br />First, the photos from the Zapruder film showed that the fatal shot came from in front of Kennedy, not from behind.  That puzzled me.  Second, the spacing between the three shots seemed awfully tight.  So tight that I had to doubt the timing.<br /><br />What I needed was something less garbled than the Warren report.  And this book supplied it.  It showed that the first bullet clearly struck both Kennedy and Connolly.  And that the bullet was fired from Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.  It also cleared up my problem with the fatal shot.  The Commission had idiotically switched the order of two key photos from the Zapruder film, making it appear that Kennedy was shot from in front (obviously stupidity by the Commission, not malice).  Posner is to be thanked for proving that and sharing it with us.<br /><br />Finally, Posner showed that the first hit and the fatal one were probably consecutive shots, solving the timing issue.<br /><br />The rest of the book is excellent as well.  I can see from reading some of the other posts that there are indeed some \\"conspiracy theorists.\\"  But there are also quite a few people who simply wanted to know what was going on, given that the evidence as stated simply didn't make sense.  Now we have something that truly puts this case to bed.	2004-11-05

And there are a few places where I'd have explained things a little differently.  But I like this book.  It is thorough and clear.  It doesn't simply tell the reader to work it out for herself or himself, but patiently covers one topic after another in detail.  Plenty of, um, time is spent on synchronization of clocks and half-lives of moving muons.  The properties of moving meter sticks are discussed at, um, length.<br /><br />Most relativity books leave it as an exercise for the reader why a signal that could travel just a tiny bit faster than the speed of light would go backwards in time.  Not this book, which uses space-time diagrams to explain this very well.<br /><br />The book goes on to make good use of Loedel diagrams, and uses them to help discuss some relativity \\"paradoxes.\\"  Once again, while other relativity books often leave the solutions to these paradoxes as exercises for the reader, Sartori spends some 35 pages addressing many of them outright.<br /><br />There are a couple of chapters at the end on General Relativity and Cosmology.  While they do not get into much of the formalism of these subjects, I think they are a valuable introduction for those who may be curious about them.<br /><br />This book sure makes learning special relativity less of a chore. If you are a student who doesn't mind being spoon-fed this material, you should try it.	2004-11-05

I just voted for Kerry for President, and while he got plenty of votes, he still lost.  I read this book without judging the author on his politics or his gambling record.<br /><br />We Americans were attacked by thugs on September 11, 2001.  That put us at war, whether we wanted to admit it or not.  Whether we fought back or not, we were still in a war.  And this book is something of a pep talk for us as we try to take proper action.<br /><br />Bennett's first topic is pacifism.  He makes the point that at some point, those who refuse to fight are putting their fates in the hands of those who do fight.  And, of course, he points out that some so-called pacifists are simply using that term as a cover for anti-Americanism: saying you are a pacifist does not guarantee that you are one.<br /><br />The next issue deals with the fact that we have an enemy.  Bennett shows that we have to regard those who attack us as our enemies.  The question is how to define that group.  Is it all radical anti-American Islamists?  All Arabs?  All Muslims?  If we pick too narrow a group, we're letting our enemies join our alliance.  If it is too large a group, we're alienating and attacking our friends.  Bennett shows the core of the problem: those groups who are truly extreme automatically try to confuse the issue by saying that in going after them, we're being unreasonable, xenophobic, Islamophobic, and racist.  And that in fact some groups that purport to represent many American Muslims, including the American Muslim Council (AMC) and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) have defended or supported the terrorist groups Hezbollah and Hamas.  I think he's making an excellent point here: we need to know where to draw the line.<br /><br />Bennett also discusses a potential consistency problem we face: can we truly oppose terrorism and at the same time declare our determination to help create a state for Yasir Arafat, whom Bennett refers to as \\"simultaneously a terrorist himself, an instigator of terrorism, and a supporter and harborer of terrorists?\\"  No, we can't.  Bennett does a good job of explaining the terrorist attacks on Israel and the folly of appeasement with regard to them.<br /><br />A final issue Bennett takes on is the reaction to patriotism in our universities.  And his issue here turns out to be academic freedom.  That greatly surprised me.  I had expected Bennett, of all people, to take risks with our freedoms in order to fight the enemy.  But he didn't.  Instead, he merely advised us to be careful about having one of our best universities accepting funds (with strings attached) from the bin Laden family.  And said that it might be a good idea for Harvard to restore giving credit for ROTC classes.<br /><br />Bennett may not have a reputation as a moderate, but in this book, he took a very moderate and inclusive stance.

But they were messy, abounding with all sorts of complicated integrals!  Reading them, it was easy to miss the forest for the trees.<br /><br />That made this book, when it came out in 1930, all the more powerful.  As Dirac said in his introduction, he tried to keep physics to the forefront, and began with an entirely physical chapter.  Later editions were a further improvement in that respect: this one is the fourth, and I like it very much.  I think it's a good way to start learning the subject.  For anyone who has made it through a college course on linear algebra, the first few chapters will be very easy.  You'll enjoy superposing states, and calculating amplitudes and probabilities.<br /><br />That said, in no way is the whole book elementary!  Quite the contrary.  It covers all the main topics: harmonic oscillators, the hydrogen atom, perturbation theory including the anomalous Zeeman effect, scattering problems, emission and absorption of photons, relativistic quantum mechanics, and quantum electrodynamics, including creation and annihilation operators.  Still, he's always reminding us of the underlying physics, and explaining, for example, that even quantum electrodynamics is not a complete description of nature, but breaks down at high enough energies.<br /><br />Even though this edition of the book is from the 1950s, it's aging very well.	2004-11-05

Avi Erlich shows us that there are at least six ways in which to think about land.<br /><br />The first of these is the principle of non-ownership.  This was adopted by many native American Indians, who regarded land as sacred and not available to be possessed.  This view is now respected, as it shows a concern for stewardship of the land.  However, Erlich points out that with property carved out for most land, this view is no longer dominant anywhere.  I would say that it is just as well.  After all, as the \\"tragedy of the commons\\" shows, we humans take care of land even more poorly when we have no ownership and thus no responsibility for it.<br /><br />The second is the idea that a person owns the field that he or she farms.  But such an idea can not be made real without laws and nations.  Without these trappings of civilization, the world would simply turn into one where one's property was determined only by might.  Still, if one does have laws and nations, this idea provides a good starting point for the concept of individual land ownership.<br /><br />The third idea is of using land as a mere business arrangement.  The land inside some boundary would be a place that gave businesses certain rights.  Of course, the enforcement of such rights would need to come from somewhere else.<br /><br />A fourth idea is that of Empire, simply taking the view that more is better.  Erlich doesn't like this, but I think we need to look into it more deeply.  When folks grab more land than they would actually purchase at a fair auction, then I think we can talk of Empire in a negative sense.  We'd then have people stealing land and holding it by force when others would make better use of it.  On the other hand, if people stole no land at all, but merely bought what they could afford, used it, and sold land when others offered them more than they felt it was worth to them, I think it would be wrong to blame them for being proud of how much land they held.<br /><br />The fifth idea takes up much of the book.  It is intellectual nationalism, which means assigning traditions, laws, customs, and other such attributes to a given region.  Unless one can think of land in this way, then these sets of traditions, laws, and customs will have no base in which to exist.  This book made me realize that by recognizing this can we see that we all lose something if we casually remove all the land from various groups, just as we all lose something if we hunt some species into extinction.<br /><br />The final idea is Erlich's least favorite way of looking at land, namely as a bunch of multicolored regions on a map.  Those regions may be rather arbitrary, with several of them having people of the same culture and language, or with one people being divided up as a minority in a couple of adjacent lands.<br /><br />Erlich illustrates these ideas with Biblical stories.  I think these stories do not always make the best illustrations of the points, but that is how he does it.<br /><br />I think Erlich's best point was that there are a few groups of dedicated individuals who have made simple ownership and restoration of land a noble intellectual enterprise.  Foremost among them may be the West Bank Jews.  These folks are his and my heroines and heroes.  They are, for the most part, a moderate and decent people in a rather wild world.  As Erlich points out, if all people reduced their ambition and envy to that of the West Bank Jews, the world would be a wonderful place, abounding with tiny nations eager for peace.land they held.<br /><br />The fifth idea takes up much of the book.

No Levantine Arab people existed when President Wilson came up with his fourteen points.  The Jews were the only people whose only home was in the region that became the British Mandate.  Stone points out that the Jewish claims to the Mandate region and Arab claims to Arab lands were dealt with together.  It was not a question of Arabs being given the land and Jews later encroaching on it.  The Mandate area was over 46,000 square miles.  Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank take up less than 11,000 square miles. The remaining 35,000 square miles was closed to Jewish settlement and made into what is now the Kingdom of Jordan.  The author explains that Jordan was created to provide sovereign land for the Arabs of the Mandate territory.  That alone weakens any further Arab claims to Mandate territory.<br /><br />Stone shows us that acceptance of Arab claims to Israel today would be a horrible precedent.  No state would be safe after that: anyone could come along and claim it.  And in fact, international law does say that no state may take an action aimed at the partial or total destruction of any other state or country.<br /><br />The next area of interest is the validity of General Assembly resolutions.  Stone discusses whether or not some of these resolutions ought to be regarded as having been carried under duress (say, by having a number of small nations getting blackmailed by a few oil-rich states).  He explains that there would be no international legal obligation to obey such resolutions.  And he then cites the case of Israel, whose right of sovereign equality was clearly violated by many UN resolutions.<br /><br />Stone then shows the untruth of the common assertion that Israel was created by the UN Partition Plan of 1947.  That Plan was never accepted by all parties.  Israel became a state by virtue of its Declaration of Independence, its establishment of orderly government, and its successful defence against those who tried to destroy it.  The UN was independent of all this.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important contribution of this book is to explain Israel's standing in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza.  Many people have been told that Jewish settlement in these areas is \\"illegal,\\" but the actual operative law is that of the Mandate, which holds such settlement to be a goal (quite the opposite of illegal!).<br /><br />This is an excellent work.  It shows that the foes of freedom did not bother to change international law to their advantage, they merely said that such law favored them.  I have little doubt that thugs will get around to rewriting international law.  At that point, folks will need to oppose them, ignore their laws, and restore order.  But as long as international law still has any justice associated with it, I think we need to remind ourselves of what it says.legal obligation to obey such resolutions.

It does say what the word \\"Pagan\\" means (it means \\"civilian\\" as opposed a monotheist soldier).  It explains a little about what ancient Pagans and Paganism were.  And the treatment of Paganism (by which I mean Polytheism) is reasonably sympathetic.<br /><br />The latter part of the book is devoted to a reasonable history of the conflict between the Christians and the Pagans in the Roman Empire, ending with the horrible and tragic lynching of Hypatia in the fifth century A.D.<br /><br />The reader is encouraged to tolerate Paganism and perhaps even see some of Paganism's advantages over monotheism.  Paganism is more suited to our varied and fickle species, and Paganism is far less likely to succumb to certain forms of intolerance that have plagued monotheism (monotheism's god is shared by all, so there is an incentive for monotheists to force their rules on others).  The author does speculate about how the world might have been a much better place had the Pagans not been so thoroughly crushed by the Christians.<br /><br />Still, this book is written, to some extent, from a viewpoint of ethical monotheism that was wrong to fight Paganism, not from a viewpoint of Paganism.  And it avoids some interesting issues, such as the Jewish response to Jezebel.<br /><br />Nor do we see as much as I'd hoped about the theological battles between Paganism and Christianity.  There just isn't much in this book that tells a reader why anyone would want to be a Pagan today, or why Paganism is theologically sounder than monotheism.<br /><br />As I see it, Pagan Goddesses and Gods have three properties that the monotheist god lacks: reality, strength, and perfection.  The monotheist god isn't bad at anything, so it can't really be good at anything.  Just as there might be a perfect work horse, or a perfect race horse, or a perfect show horse, but never a \\"perfect horse,\\" there can be a perfect Goddess of Wisdom but never a \\"perfect monotheist god.\\"  Being perfect at one thing means being bad at something else.  Having only one god of everything is no different from having no god at all. Meanwhile, the real Goddesses and Gods are perfections of genuine and real attributes.  Saint Anselm's ontological argument (perfection requires existence, given that nonexistence is an imperfection) does not apply to god, but it does apply to the Gods and Goddesses.  In addition, a truly supremely glorious Entity has to be created by something less glorious and less complex.  It can't be a \\"first cause.\\"  Philosophically, a first cause would have to be extremely simple and inglorious, hardly the sort of thing anyone would want to hail, much less worship.  The Goddesses and Gods are the strong and glorious ones, while the monotheist god is too inglorious and weak.<br /><br />Yes, Kirsch wrote a nice book.  But given his perspective, he couldn't say anything quite like that!  Nor could he even say some of what you'd find in Cioran's little book, \\"The New Gods.\\"  For example, Kirsch would call the victory for the Christians as forcing the adoption of the \\"Only True God,\\" while Cioran would be more likely to call it forcing the \\"trading in\\" of the Gods and Goddesses for a small and ugly \\"nailed corpse.\\"<br /><br />Finally, I think Kirsch could have continued his story a little.  He could have discussed Charlemagne's battles against the Saxon Pagans.  And perhaps he could have discussed the conversion of Iceland to Christianity in the year 1000 A.D.  At that time, Hjalti Skeggjason called Freyja a female dog.  While that was a rather mild insult, I think it showed that after so many centuries, the Christians still had no good arguments against Paganism.

While the initial exercises require far less scientific sophistication than the later ones, it is definitely written with potential scientists in mind (astronomy undergraduates in particular).  It starts with some very preliminary material on our perception of the shape of the sky, followed by the use of sky charts and then an explanation of Stonehenge as a tool to calculate eclipses.  The next twenty or so chapters deal with the fundamentals of doing planetary astronomy, while the final chapters move us outside the Solar System.

But much of what they come up with is closer to brazen lies.  And even were it merely controversial and speculative, they could have instead used plenty of simple facts that we could have agreed upon, and from which we could have drawn our own conclusions.<br /><br />The authors explain that they are for justice and human rights.  Once again, I think this is the right approach.  But I don't see much of either in this book.  One obvious test of justice is this:  What if you didn't know whether you were a Muslim, Jew, Christian, Pagan, Arabic-speaker, Hebrew-speaker, soldier, civilian, Arab West Bank settler, Jewish West Bank settler, or whatever?  What if you then had to come up with a just solution?  What would you do, given that you would find out who you were only after you came up with the answer?  Had the Reuthers tried such an approach, they might have seen how far they were from justice.<br /><br />Now, what about human rights?  Well, there is a Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Had they looked at it more closely, they would have seen that rights of life, liberty, and security (article 3) ought to belong to both Arabs and Jews, rather than neither.  And that article 17 states that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of their property, while article 30 insists that nothing in the UDHR shall be interpreted in a way as to allow any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms that were previously stated.  Again, I think that on such a basis, it becomes clear that for all their nice words, the Reuthers are awfully far from promoting human rights.<br /><br />The Reuthers state that Jewish nationalism simply required the obliteration of the rights of others.  And this raises the leading question of whether it's worth it.  But the truth is that Jewish nationalism required no such thing.  The Jews who moved into the region in the past two centuries merely required rights to life, liberty, property, and immigration.  For them, liberty included the right to speak Hebrew, be Jewish, and build schools and hospitals.  And, of course, defend themselves from attack.  This did not threaten the rights of anyone else.  If all newcomers to a land were to be charged with demolishing the rights of those already there, it would be an international crime to be born anywhere.<br /><br />The Reuthers overlook the fact that the incoming Jews were a very peaceful group which had not fought as a nation for centuries.  These people were, for the most part, not eager to fight, unwilling to fight, and morally opposed to fighting.  In addition, they were very small in numbers, had few weapons, and had no army.  That gave them no choice but to cooperate with their neighbors and fight only as a very last resort in self-defence.  But you won't get that impression from this book! Instead, you'll see claims that the Jewish leadership during the Mandate period planned military adventures to expel non-Jews!  Such a plan would have been totally illogical.  And, not surprisingly, the historical evidence shows that it didn't happen. In fact, only Arab attacks on Jews (that resulted in a British halt to Jewish immigration) got the Jewish leaders to demand a State at all.  In 1948, when Arab states launched an all-out war against Israel in which many Jews were killed or displaced, some Arabs were kicked out of their homes too, but this was tactical, and not part of any grand design.<br /><br />The Arab population of Israel and the West Bank has gone way up since 1948.  The West Bank Jews, not the Arabs, are the ones threatened with ethnic cleansing.<br /><br />Is this history important?  Yes.  Not to show that the Jews were guilty or not guilty, but to remind everyone of the bigger picture: peace is a victory for the Jews.  It is important to realize that the picture the Reuthers present is inaccurate and inconsistent.  It is of people that were busy draining swamps and making the deserts bloom so they could be prosperous and happy and at the same time were suicidally busy trying to figure out how to hurt their far more numerous neighbors so they could get themselves killed!<br /><br />The truth is that the Jewish population has needed peace desperately, and that's one reason why antizionist thugs have delighted in making bogus offers of peace.<br /><br />There's one more problem with the overall approach of the Reuthers.  To claim that the Jews are stealing land and persecuting innocent victims, they need to give the Jews a reason to act in such an obviously self-destructive manner.  And they've got such a reason: fundamental religious claims of ownership.  But it's not true: Jewish politics in the region has been dominated by secular elements.<br /><br />Actually, the Jews got their land by buying it at high prices.  They did not just waltz into the Levant unarmed and steal it for no reason from hapless heavily armed Arabs, all in the name of religious fundamentalism.  The antizionists are the ones making arbitrary claims to the land, with logic of the form:  God does not exist.  Therefore God is not in the real estate business.  Therefore God did not give the land to the Jews.  Therefore She did give it to the Arabs.  In perpetuity, no matter how often they sell it to others.<br /><br />The Jewish claim to the land is simple: they were numerous, they wanted the land, they outbid others for it, they bought it.  And if the Reuthers believed in truth, justice, and human rights, we'd be seeing a very different book from them.he deserts bloom so they could be prosperous and happy and at the same time were suicidally busy trying to figure out how to hurt their far more numerous neighbors so they could get themselves killed!

But it does so from a perspective that I think we need to realize is ridiculous.<br /><br />Yes, Ross does wonder, even in this book, if Arafat ever really wanted peace.  And if all the incitement and lack of preparation for peace was a major factor in all these misadventures.  But let's look at what Ross still doesn't get.<br /><br />First, Ross managed to help get an Israeli government to agree to a proposal that would have granted well over 90% of the West Bank to the Arabs, as well as a portion of the Israeli capital city.  That would be more than most nations would agree to give even to a completely friendly neighbor.  Israel is, after all, quite land-poor, with a population of over six million (including over five million Jews) in about ten thousand square miles (including the entire West Bank).  But Israel agreed, under prodding from the United States, to give land not to a friend but to a terrorist enemy that was almost certain to pocket any gains, start a war, and then blame Israel.<br /><br />Next, Ross laments the fact that Arafat was unable to agree to the proposals that were offered.  I doubt that he realized the extent to which both sides disliked them.  Nor does he realize how lucky he is that there was no agreement.  Arafat would have violated any agreement and would then have blamed Israel.  As for starting a war, Arafat has been able to do that at will.  All he needs to do is claim that a Jew walked down the street, and his troops will waltz up to Israeli soldiers and civilians and attack them.  Had there been an agreement, we'd still have the war we now have, but with the added misfortune of having \\"ethnically cleansed\\" tens of thousands of West Bank Jews.<br /><br />Finally, the worst part has to be the frantic efforts that Ross was involved in to try to reach an agreement at the end of the year 2000.  This truly was \\"negotiating under fire.\\"  Arafat had already launched an attack on Israel.  Arafat had already come up with a totally bogus excuse for the attack.  Arafat had already blamed Israel for the violence when all Israel had done was defend itself.  And Arafat was not arrested and put on trial.  Instead, he was rewarded with Israel's best offer ever!<br /><br />Two main obstacles to peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors are antizionist incitement and antizionist lies.  These are as serious as the antizionist aggression and terror that often accompany them.  I think Ross should have discussed these problems to a much greater extent.<br /><br />If you have to read this book, you may want to try a couple of other books on the subject as well.  There are plenty of them.  But in order to get a different perspective, I suggest including Bodansky's \\"The High Cost of Peace,\\" and also \\"The Mideast Peace Process\\" edited by Neal Kozodoy.d an attack on Israel.

And it's worth reading.<br /><br />But why did I read it?  It was because I'd seen an article by Gordis called \\"Take Off That Mask.\\"  The article was in the form of a letter, sent at Purim to Jill Jacobs, a graduating rabbinical student.  The letter began, \\"Dear Jill,\\"  and I simply had to read it.  Jill was quite properly concerned about human rights in Israel, not just for Jews but for everyone.  But when she wrote about it, she came up with something quite controversial that eventually got a reply from Gordis.  He pointed out that Jill was showing an unjustified certainty that Israel was simply Wrong, and that she was claiming that Israel had better options that were manifest to any moral person.  And that her writing showed a dangerous and myopic irresponsibility, as well as a lack of love for Israel.  Well, after reading all that, I simply had to read \\"If a Place Can Make You Cry.\\"<br /><br />The more I thought about this interesting and thoughtfully written book, the more I realized that it deserved a jilllike response.  Maybe something like, um:<br /><br />Dear Daniel,<br /><br />I'm a Pagan.  I really enjoyed your book.  I don't judge Israel.  I don't think it is Wrong.  And I don't know what it ought to do.  Still, even though I know that many centuries ago, the Jews in that region killed Jezebel, I truly support Israel.  And I hope that it will thrive in peace and that vast numbers of Israeli Jews will be walking out of Yom Kippur services during Yizkor.<br /><br />I've thought about why Israel is rightfully Yours and not Mine.  And here is my answer.  There are millions of You.  And just one of Me.  And You wanted Israel and You outbid others and bought the land and made it bloom.  That is why it is rightfully Yours.<br /><br />Shabbat Shalom,<br /><br />Jill	2004-10-31

It consists of about 50 separate essays.  One of the inspirations for the book was Philip Roth's novel, \\"Operation Shylock,\\" and the relevant excerpt from this book is included as one of the essays.  That essay explains the threat of Israel becoming a sort of extermination camp for Jews, with nuclear weapons rather than Zyklon B being the relevant weapon.<br /><br />The book, which begins with an excellent introduction by Ron Rosenbaum, is a superb collection of ideas and thoughts.  One of the essays that impressed me the most was by Tom Gross, describing the ghastly reporting by the British media of the events in Jenin in April, 2002.  Until I read this article, I just couldn't believe that the folks at the Guardian would abandon all journalistic standards just to hurt a few Jews by spouting some absurd lies about Israel.  After all, no matter what they thought about Jews or Israel, these people were professionals who I thought were unlikely to wish to destroy the good reputation the Guardian had so carefully built up.  Such destruction would cost them money!  But this article showed me that they had indeed turned the Guardian into something far less valuable than it had been in the past (perhaps thinking that such an approach would appear more sensational and improve their sales).<br /><br />I also especially enjoyed the articles by Paul Berman, Robert Wistrich, Gabriel Schoenfeld, Ruth Wisse, Melanie Phillips, Joshua Muravchik, Martin Peretz, Cynthia Ozick, Fiamma Nirenstein, and Bernard Lewis.  And of course, I had to read the essay by Daniel Gordis that started \\"Dear Jill.\\"  No, it wasn't to me, it was to Jill Jacobs.  But it was a scary look into the politics of a graduating rabbinical student.<br /><br />There are articles by various opponents of Zionism, including Tariq Ramadan, Edward Said, and Judith Butler.

And Sir Edmund Hillary's story of how he and Tenzing Norgay did it is terrific and even to my suspicious eyes seems sincere.<br /><br />The portion of the book I was most curious about dealt with the Antarctic Expedition of 1957 to 1958.  Hillary was the leader of the Ross Sea Party, which was to was to lay provisions between the Ross Sea and the South Pole to support the crossing of Antarctica by the Transpolar Party, starting from the Weddell Sea.  The Transpolar Party was led by the overall expedition leader, Dr. Vivian (Bunny) Fuchs.  The two parties reached the South Pole in January, 1958 after which they made it to the Ross Sea in less than six weeks.  As the two parties neared the Pole, the telegrams between Bunny and Hillary were in all the newspapers.  Vivian had told the story from his point of view in his 1958 book, \\"The Crossing of Antarctica,\\" and even though that book also included eighteen pages written by Hillary, I was glad to see more of what Hillary had to say, especially with his perspective of writing about it so much later.<br /><br />This entire book is worth reading and tells us plenty about the life of a successful adventurer.	2004-10-29

Along with explanations that the main problem is \\"Israeli greed?\\"  And Israel's \\"illegal theft of Arab land?\\"  And the horror of Israel permitting Jews to live in Judea?<br /><br />If so, then I think this book is for you.  Its many essays tell, in dramatic style, how things look from an Israeli perspective.  There are a wide variety of articles about the effect of all this terror on Israel and Israelis.

It's my impression that most of what he says is rather tame and cautious.  And that most of what he says is not very controversial.  He often has something illuminating in his essays, but much of this is relatively apolitical.<br /><br />At least in this book, I was able to figure out which political party he favored!<br /><br />Now, it is true that Pipes has often said that militant Islamic attacks on Americans were a form of war as opposed to individual criminal acts.  He's said that our government ought to take seriously the ideology that has been motivating such attacks, and that we ought to make policy changes in order to win this war and destroy the effectiveness of any enemy forces.  Well, our administration has regarded the 9/11 attacks as war.  It has tried to destroy the enemy forces.  As near as I can tell, what Pipes has advocated here has been fair and reasonable.<br /><br />Pipes feels that the battle is not against Islam but against militant Islamists, a group that can be marginalized and defeated with the help of moderate Muslims.  Again, this does not sound all that radical an idea.<br /><br />Pipes is indeed bothered by Islamic militants who manage to pass themselves off as moderates.  If they get away with it, Pipes' recommendations will be misimplemented and doomed.<br /><br />I liked the essays and found them informative.  Maybe you will as well.  But if you were looking for something wild and maybe, um, raging and fuming, you won't find it here.	2004-10-26

But plenty of what is in it is dubious.<br /><br />It starts out with the Exodus.  With a huge army fleeing Egypt.  There's no archaeological evidence for any of this, of course.<br /><br />What it says about Biblical warfare is intriguing, but once again, I'd want to see independent confirmation of some of this before I fully accepted it.<br /><br />Then comes Joshua's conquest of Canaan.  That also has no archaeological evidence to back it up.<br /><br />Finally, we get into an era where there's more and more evidence to back up what is being talked about.  But by now, I think the main value of the book is to get the reader to ask a few questions that one might otherwise not have thought to ask.  Here are eight examples:<br /><br />1)  Was there a Jewish revolt in 351 AD which led to the sacking of Tiberias?<br /><br />2)  Were there Samaritan rebellions against the Byzantines in 484 AD and 529 AD?  Who led them?<br /><br />3)  Was there a Jewish and Samaritan riot against the Christians of Caesaria in 556 AD?  Followed by a Jewish riot in Antioch in 608 AD?<br /><br />4)  Was Yemen a Jewish state in 525 AD, and if so, what wars did it get into?<br /><br />5)  Where can one find a more scholarly description of the final Zealot war, from 614 AD to 628 AD?<br /><br />6)  Who was Mahrab?  Was he a powerful Jew who fought against the Muslims during Mohammed's lifetime?  Did Mahrab really have a sister named Zainab who became one of Mohammed's wives but was executed for putting poison in his food?<br /><br />7)  Did Ethiopia have a Jewish Queen in 975 AD?<br /><br />8)  When did the Khazars convert to Judaism?  The eighth century?  The ninth?<br /><br />Anyway, the book is fun to read.  However, most of it is speculative at best.	2004-10-26

We'd like to think that after enough crimes, such people would be arrested and removed from the public scene permanently.  But Arafat proves that this isn't the case, and this book shows how serious a blot it is on Mankind's record to have treated Arafat so generously.<br /><br />As Karsh shows, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was correct to point out that \\"Arafat is the greatest obstacle to peace and stability in the Middle East.\\"  But he also shows that this is due in large part to the positive reactions Arafat's crimes have generated.  People in nations all over the world, leaders included, have rewarded Arafat for the violence he's almost constantly perpetrated.  This has not required any cleverness on Arafat's part: he simply commits violent acts and gets applause.  If he gets caught, he gets away with it.  As for what he says, that is easy too.  He simply tells lies all the time.  People accept some of them, or say they do.  Again, when he gets caught, he gets away with it.<br /><br />Arafat has been a lifelong enemy of human rights, and especially of human rights for Jews.  What impressed me about this book was not how awful Arafat has been.  It was how awful human civilization has been to honor him for it.  It made me embarrassed to be a human being.<br /><br />Of course, Arafat has taken obvious advantage of being put in control of Gaza and much of the West Bank.  He's made sure that the sermons in these places are political incitement.  And he's made sure that the schoolkids are all taught to hate and kill.  Karsh shows the extent to which this has happened, as well as the toleration of such behavior by the world community.  And Karsh also shows how Arafat has organized violent attacks on Israel.  I was surprised that the bulk of the violence was unprovoked, although ridiculous excuses for it were often invented at the time or afterwards.  And I was shocked by the degree to which some of these patent lies were taken seriously by world leaders.  Some may feel that this merely shows Arafat's ability to deceive.  I strongly disagree with such a conclusion.  I think if Arafat could do it, anyone could.  After all, he's never acted intelligent or trustworthy.<br /><br />Well, what needs to be done?  Karsh gives us all some advice.  He points out the structural reforms that were needed in 1945 in Germany and Japan for them to attain freedom and democracy.  And he explains that Arafat and his gang will need to be swept from power and replaced by leaders who are willing to co-exist with their neighbors.it were often invented at the time or afterwards.

Some Arab tribes were in the region even earlier.  But I'm not so sure what this proves.  Germanic-speaking people have lived in various parts of Europe for quite a while as well.  But it still is neither reasonable nor proper to give Arabic-speakers or German-speakers a right to swipe land by gobbling up small neighboring nations.<br /><br />Kimmerling and Migdal show a tendency to repeat some of Arafat's absurd and arbitrary untruths as if they were valid.  Reading this book, you would get the idea that unprovoked attacks ordered by Arafat were somehow spontaneous and provoked by Israel.<br /><br />However, there is a deeper problem with the whole idea of such a book.  Namely, are we taking a few thugs and misrepresenting them as leaders of a \\"people?\\"  Surely, we would not call the Ku Klux Klan a \\"people.\\"  Nor the \\"Aryan Nation.\\"<br /><br />The authors ought to have been more serious about their language.  Are the Arabs of the Levant truly a people, such as, say, the Hungarians, who have a language, traditions, a foreign policy, and so forth?  With impeccable national credentials?  Of course not.  Are these Arabs more like the Mormons, a group that in the nineteenth century clearly lacked national credentials but were prepared to consider their options, including an option to take advantage of nationhood and behave like a nation?  Or are they more like the Sudetens, who in the 1930s became a manifest fraud for the purpose of depriving Czechs of their rights, all in the name of German nationalism and Empire?<br /><br />This book is not a contribution to a scholarly assessment of such questions.  It's just propaganda for use in a war against the rights of non-Arabs in the Levant.	2004-10-25

That is, he tries to explain Biblical stories such as those of Adam, the Flood, the tower of Babel, Abraham, Joseph, and Moses.  Well, first, he has to convince us that these stories merit any explanation at all.<br /><br />Do Biblical scholars really feel that archaeological evidence supports the story of Adam at some specific place?  No.  How about the Flood?  That's a well-known tale in many traditions.  But all we need is evidence that there was some really bad weather a long time ago to explain it.  As for the Tower of Babel, there is no reason to take the story seriously in the first place.<br /><br />When we get to Abraham, I think it is reasonable for Salibi to point out that the stories about him look like they refer to multiple people.  But past that, there is little to say.<br /><br />Salibi is aware that the story of Moses is a central part of Jewish tradition.  And that whether Moses or Abraham actually existed, the so-called Mosiac and Abrahamic traditions are different.  He's also aware that there's no archaeological evidence of an Exodus into the Sinai.  But that is hardly a justification to invent an Exodus on the Arabian peninsula!<br /><br />To explain the existence of the Israelites in ancient Israel, starting somewhere around the 13th century BC, no Exodus is required.  The only thing left to explain is where the story of the Exodus comes from.  And that could be from just about anywhere, as long as the people involved in coming up with the story wound up in ancient Israel eventually.  Whether or not there was a historical Moses, Salibi is going way overboard to hypothesize that a large and successful slave revolt had to take place, with people wandering all over the map.<br /><br />There's plenty of reason to start taking Biblical history as evidence starting with the book of Judges.  But Biblical history prior to that is almost totally suspect, something some readers may not be aware of.  Salibi is taking these stories too seriously.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Salibi's book has been demolished by just about every scholar who has reviewed it.of.

But Thompson has managed to write something even worse.<br /><br />It is one thing to point out that Biblical stories of the Exodus and the conquest of Israel by Joshua are contradicted by archaeological evidence (they are).  It is quite another to throw out genuine archaeological evidence as well as any connections to Biblical stories from the Book of Judges onwards, as though neither people nor history existed back then!<br /><br />If folks want to say that there were ancient Israelites back in the 13th century BC, and have some evidence for it (including, say, Merneptah's Stele, which appears to refer to them explicitly), then right or wrong, that's scholarship.  If others want to say that the actual Israelites did not appear until the 12th or 11th century BC, and present some evidence for that (including explaining the Stele, of course), well, that's scholarship as well.  I'd refer interested readers to works such as \\"The First Historians\\" by Baruch Halpern (1988), \\"The Archaeology of the Land of Israel\\" by Yohanan Aharoni (1978) and \\"Who Were the Israelites and Where Did They Come From?\\" by William Dever (2003).<br /><br />Thompson, however, is an anti-scholar.  He knows that people existed from the 13th through the 3rd centuries BC.  He knows there's enormous amounts of corroborating evidence about what those people were like.  And he's out to denounce anyone who says anything about them, no matter what they say!  It's simply ridiculous.<br /><br />The claim that there were no such people as the ancient Israelites is not scholarly unless it is backed up by some rather striking evidence.  Thompson has nothing of the sort.<br /><br />This guy is worse than the Bible-is-truth fundamentalists.

Of course, the title begins with the words \\"Facing Up\\" which to Weinberg has three meanings: looking upwards as an astronomer, facing up to the conclusions one derives, and looking upwards rather than downwards as if in prayer.<br /><br />Well, who are the cultural adversaries of Science?  Creationists?  Certainly.  But there are others.  Weinberg agrees with most of the Creationists about truth being a value.  The disagreement with them is about which side possesses it.  There are others who attack the value of truth, including many multiculturalists.  We Westerners say that the Milky Way is a Galaxy, our home Galaxy.  That works for us.  Mayan culture had the Milky Way as a river in the sky.  That may have worked for them.  Can Weinberg say that one belief is better than the other?  He sure can.  As he says, \\"Western astronomers got it right.\\"<br /><br />Weinberg criticizes some political attacks on truth as well.  That's the point of his very short (about one page) article on Zionism.  His point is not that anti-Zionists may tell specific lies as a means to some goal (such as winning a war).  It is that, especially when he deals with fellow Western liberals, anti-Zionism is an attack on Western civilization and the culture of science in general, so that defeating truth as a whole becomes an anti-Zionist goal.  It is also the point of his article about utopias, some of which idealize a world in which the cultural adversaries of Science are either right or victorious or both.<br /><br />Still, the most interesting articles are on Reductionism.  This is a philosophy of trying to explain phenomena in terms of a finite set of laws, describing something complex in terms of the less complex, and describing large numbers of obervations with just a few simple rules.  It is not simply an act of trying to describe objects in terms of their components.  For Weinberg, reductionism is an important part of scientific culture.<br /><br />It's an intriguing and informative book, and I recommend it.eductionism is an important part of scientific culture.

And I see that there may be some misconceptions that need to be cleared up.<br /><br />Jews and Christians have indeed been traditional enemies.  Obviously, that isn't good for either of them, particularly for the much less numerous Jews.  Matter of fact, Jews and Pagans have also been traditional enemies.  Anyway, Foxman explains some of the history of Christian antisemitism and its effect on Jewish attitudes today.<br /><br />But there is a point to what might otherwise look like mere whining.  Jews are looking for reasonable behavior from others.  And Foxman makes it clear what sorts of things one can do to be polite and reasonable.  No matter what religious views one has, one does not need to be an antisemite, nor does one need to look like an antisemite.  That's important to know if one wants to socialize with Jews or support human rights for Jewish Israelis.<br /><br />Can we criticize Judaism without being thought of as antisemites?  Absolutely.  Can we criticize Israeli policies without being thought of as antisemites?  Yes.  Foxman's \\"sensitivity\\" is a blessing in that respect.  Let's not forget that everyone is offendable, not just Jews.  If we're not socially adept enough to avoid offending Jewish friends, maybe we need to read this book.<br /><br />Of course, Foxman shows that there is more to it than this.  Antisemitism, while it can start out as simple fun and games, has had serious consequences for over fifteen centuries.  The latest metastasy of this phenomenon has passed itself off as \\"mere\\" antizionism.  But if it involves calling Zionism a form of racism, or denying Israel (and only Israel) a right to nationhood, it is simply more of the same taunting, baiting, and dishonesty that has traditionally led to violence - first against Jews and later against others.<br /><br />Finally, we ought to think twice before we dismiss all concerns about antisemitism.  While it is true that there have been very few deaths caused by antisemitic attacks during the past few years compared to the number of Jewish deaths during World War 2, there have been quite a few recent attacks and the number of dead is not negligible.  In addition, anti-Jewish propaganda in the Arab world is as intense as anything seen before.  Foxman shows the extent to which some of it has become a part of our global culture.  That's a valuable warning and lesson for all of us.mitic attacks during the past few years compared to the number of Jewish deaths during World War 2, there have been quite a few recent attacks and the number of dead is not negligible.

But when we're trying to be impartial, we often overcompensate and apply less criticism than warranted.  There are a couple of reasons for this.  One is that we'd prefer to be fair, in the hope of being judged fairly ourselves.  That makes us lean towards leniency in judging others.  Another is that when we deal with other societies, we can argue that what we think of as strange behavior has probably helped them last long enough to be criticized.<br /><br />This has resulted in some misunderstandings about actual problems with other societies.  Symptoms of this, as the author explains, are beliefs by many modern Western scholars in \\"cultural relativism,\\" and claims that \\"primitive\\" societies were far more harmonious than modern ones.<br /><br />Edgerton points out that while selective forces have sometimes forced societies to adapt, get absorbed by others, or become extinct, \\"more often there has not been enough competition among societies to bring about major social or cultural change.\\"  That is, once one's society can survive and maintain itself, it can keep a number of counterproductive customs and beliefs.  He asserts that some of what we can rightfully judge as maladaptive may be inherent in human nature: desires for variety can lead to taking unnecessary risks, while desires to cooperate can lead to accomodating dangerous group beliefs and superstitions.  On top of that, he claims that many societies have indeed perished at least in part due to maladaptive behavior.  This puts him at odds with those who feel that to first order, societies are forced by selection to act adaptively.<br /><br />The author does admit that some kinds of behavior that appear maladaptive, such as preferring death to slavery (or defeat) may in fact be adaptive (making sacrifices to save the rest of one's society could indeed be adaptive behavior for the society).  One example he gave (of the Jewish Zealots at Masada) seemed unconvincing to me.  But I do think that examples of sacrifice in successful wars of defense, or simply by police and firemen in times of need could be cited here.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the book to read if you think there is something wrong with certain kinds of superstitions, xenophobia, racism, male chauvinism, and a large number of other kinds of behavior that drag down the quality of life in a society.  We can and should judge ourselves.  And I don't see how we can do that if we're afraid to judge others.g to me.

I didn't expect a commission to do such a competent job.  But it accomplished what ought to have been its two main goals: to state what is now known to be true and relevant, and to avoid including any wild speculations that might cast doubt on the quality of the entire work.  The aim is to clarify what happened and derive lessons from it.  This aim appears to have overridden some of the tendency to skew blame or avoid potentially embarrassing issues.<br /><br />On top of that, the book is readable and fascinating.  The authors are to be commended for letting us know what happened and what we as a nation are up against.  I recommend it.	2004-10-23

And I find it even more puzzling to see the beginnings of alliances between many Muslim fundamentalists and Christian liberals.  What's up with that?  This book helps explain it.<br /><br />First, the Christian fundamentalists and the Jewish liberals.  Traditionally, Jewish liberals have been suspicious of Christian fundamentalists for many reasons: the most vocal Christians have generally defamed Jews, encouraged anti-Jewish violence, and engaged in missionary work that Jews have reacted very negatively to.  In addition, views on social issues such as abortion, school prayer, and gay rights have generally been very different among these two groups.  And Christian fundamentalists have been suspicious of Jewish liberals for some of the same reasons: differences on social issues as well as the hostility that they see on the Jewish side.<br /><br />Why is it becoming different now?  The author explains that it is because both sides see a need to defend Israel.  I think that explains part of it.  But I think he overlooked something even more important: both the Christians and Jews are siding with Israel for the same reasons.  That is, the constant Arab lies, the United Nations and European Union support for Arab terror, and the dishonesty of many in the media have angered both groups in the same way.  And even upon further reflection, they both still see all these problems as serious threats to society as a whole.<br /><br />That's the easy part.<br /><br />The tough question, which Merkley answers superbly, is why we're seeing an alliance between Christian liberals and Muslim fundamentalists.  Merkley shows that it goes far beyond any need to attack Israel.<br /><br />The two groups are strange bedfellows indeed.  They have different religions, and their attitudes towards religion are very different.  One group has mostly liberal values while the other is reactionary and intolerant.  Historically, they have the legacy of Muslim invasions of Europe, the Crusades, and European colonialism.  Why would liberal Christians support those who favor slavery, terrorism, totalitarianism, irredentism, mistreatment of Women, and intolerance of the rights of others in general?  Why would fundamentalist Muslims even seek or accept such support?<br /><br />It certainly isn't any rational need to oppose Israeli behavior.  As the author points out, \\"Israel's offence follows from the nature of Islam.\\"  This alliance is the result of three factors: Muslim offence at the existence of Jewish rights in Israel, Muslim pressure on the Christians of the Middle East, and long-standing contempt of Judaism by more than a few Western Christians.<br /><br />Merkley shows that the effect of all this has been devastating to the Christians of the Middle East.  The majority have fled the area.  Most of those who have stayed have done so either because they supported Muslim terror against the Jews or because they were pressured into tolerating it.  This has poisoned their relations with the Israeli Jews while not raising their esteem in the eyes of Arab Muslims.<br /><br />Merkley is at his best when he documents the reactions of all sorts of diverse Christian groups to the State of Israel.  I strongly recommend this book.  And if you want more, read Bat Ye'or's book on Islam and Dhimmitude next.ral values while the other is reactionary and intolerant.

He also shows the extent to which we're getting intentionally counterproductive \\"advice\\" from some of the leaders of these nations.  One example is our war on Saddam Hussein.  Some may say that we ought to have followed the advice of the French and others and not invaded Iraq.  What this book shows is that these nations were not trying to help us and that their advice and actions, whether they turned out well or not, were intended to be unhelpful.<br /><br />Gibson points out the extent to which Saudi Arabia is part of the problem.  I had no idea that 90% of the viewers of the al Qaeda website were Saudis, and that information tells me a great deal about where much of the fundamentalist terror we see to day is generated.<br /><br />In the future, we'll have ongoing questions about how seriously to trust France, Germany, Belgium, and various Arab nations.

I want justice.  For everyone.  I want human rights, including rights to life, liberty, and property.  For everyone.  As near as I can tell, Rubenberg does not.<br /><br />If you are reading this review and are not so sure that I am being fair in making such statements, I challenge you to pretend that you do not know whether you are a Christian, Jew, Muslim, or Pagan.  That you do not know whether you are a soldier or a civilian.  That you do not know what nationality you are.  Pretend that you'll find out only after you decide what fairness and justice are.  Then decide what is fair and just.  If you do that and still read Rubenberg's book, I think you'll quickly see how far Rubenberg is from advocating justice.<br /><br />Without justice, there are no rights.  Without truth, there is no justice.  And, having read her book, it seems to me that Rubenberg can't stand truth.  She starts by making misleading statements about demography and land ownership.  She skips the entire history of Arab attacks on Jews and replaces it with absurd fabrications about Zionism's purpose, intentions, and history.  At all times, she appears to oppose both justice and human rights and seems ready to fight to the last Arab to hurt Israel.<br /><br />Rubenberg doesn't like Arafat either, blaming him for agreeing to negotiate with Israel about the disputed territories.  And, of course, she does not like the United States, a nation that to her is under the thumb of the infamous Zionist Lobby and is therefore unwilling to oppose any Israeli policies.  It makes me wonder why she bothered accepting her position at Florida International University in the first place.<br /><br />I found it embarrassing that a fellow human being could be so dishonest and nasty.<br /><br />Still, I have to admit that I did read the book, and all her notes.  She says that perhaps the best account of the history of Jerusalem is the one by Karen Armstrong.  I had just read it!<br /><br />Avoid both books.	2004-10-22

There's plenty of solid material here and very little fluff.  The information is well presented, up-to-date, and easy to read.<br /><br />Three of the nine chapters are about the potential for life elsewhere in our planetary system, in particular on Mars, Europa, and Titan.  Another three chapters are on extrasolar planets: how to find them, what we've discovered so far about them, and what signatures of life we might try to look for on them in the future.  There's also a chapter on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).  That leaves two chapters for the definition and origin of life, the Earth's acquisition of the necessary water and carbon, and so on.  I'd prefer to see quite a bit more on biology here.  I'd like to see much more discussion of the development of multicellular life, the changes in the Earth's environment caused by the production of oxygen, and the evolution of humans.<br /><br />That said, I really liked the chapter on the origin of life.  It was illuminating to read about the origin of chirality, written by a specialist in organic matter in meteorites.  And I also especially liked the chapters on exoplanets.	2004-10-22

I'm sure many of us are aware that Islam is associated with plenty of bad behavior.  We see the rights of women and homosexuals threatened in Muslim nations.  We see an intolerance for non-Muslims.  Some Muslims are embarrassed that what they feel is True Islam has been hijacked by those who have mangled its message.  Others say that Islam is in need of reform.<br /><br />A few (including my grandmother) simply look at the theological lack of justification for Islam and the dubious acts by some of those who practice it and decide to adopt a different way of life.  The author of this book is such a person.<br /><br />We soon find out why.  He explains that the problem is not those who practice Islam.  For the author, the problem is twofold, Muhammad's teachings and Islamic law.  No wonder he's against it!  He left Islam at an early age, convinced that all religions are demonstrably false and pernicious.  The Rushdie Affair and various reactions to it infuriated him and convinced him to write this book.  The title is taken from that of a famous speech by Bertrand Russell at the Battersea Town Hall in March of 1927 titled \\"Why I Am Not A  Christian.\\"  Ibn Warraq is a pen name that has been traditionally adopted by dissident authors throughout the history of Islam.<br /><br />Ibn Warraq explains to us the totalitarian nature of Islam, a religion that he shows is not compatible with democracy and human rights but is compatible with fascism, imperialism, colonialism and racism.  And he warns us that Western intellectuals who refuse to criticize Islam are doing no one any favors.  His conclusion is that if there is to be a battle, it will not be between Islam and the West, but simply between those who value freedom and those who do not.<br /><br />No matter how you feel about Islam, this is worth reading.	2004-10-22

Their patterns, often symmetrical, are surprisingly intricate.  I'm surprised that more people haven't studied these remarkable objects.  Now there is a terrific book on the subject by Caltech physicist Kenneth Libbrecht, with incredible photographs taken by Patricia Rasmussen.<br /><br />I remember how fascinated I was by Basil J. Mason's article on Snow Crystals in the January, 1961 issue of Scientific American.  Now, finally, there's a work on the topic that brings us all up-to-date.  It explains what types of snow crystals form at different temperatures and how minor changes in weather conditions as a snowflake falls determine the actual pattern while roughly maintaining the symmetry.<br /><br />As I see it, there are four major areas a good book about snowflakes ought to try to cover.  The first is what snowflakes look like.  This book does a superb job, noticeably better even than Wilson Bentley's 1931 book, Snow Crystals.  The second is why snowflakes have the patterns they do, and how this enormous complexity originates.  Again, this book does a fine job, extending the work of Ukichiro Nakiya by including results of experiments performed in Libbrecht's laboratory.  The third is how to make artificial snowflakes.  Once again, this book is superb, showing the excellent results of Libbrecht's attempts at making \\"designer snowflakes.\\"  These snowflakes are home-grown at the end of ice needles, a technique that Basil Mason had developed and Libbrecht has improved upon.  The fourth should be a reference to some good software that would allow users to produce artificial snowflake designs on their computer screens.  The lack of such a reference leads me to suspect that no good software exists yet.	2004-10-21

Just ask Karen Armstrong.  Should it be awarded to the evil Christians, who killed the Pagans and went back on the noble idea of refusing to consider mere terrain sacred?  Obviously not.  How about to the Pagans?  No, of course not.  They don't count at all, even though I must admit that Armstrong does refer to them a few times.  How about to the Jews?  No, these folks are just interlopers who had to invent arbitrary myths to pretend that they cared at all about the place, much less had a right to be there.  The winners are ... (envelope please!) ... the Muslims!  The Muslim Arabs had no need to invent any myths to \\"fuel their struggle\\" because Jerusalem was theirs like a spouse.  I wonder if Karen will award Paris to the Germans next.<br /><br />I was hoping to see a more sympathetic treatment of Aelia Capitolina.  Still, I wasn't shocked by Armstrong's lack of concern for the polytheists: she seemed to discuss them only to complain about the Christians.  But I was surprised to see Armstrong trying to mislead her readers into thinking that Jerusalem is Arab by right and is in the process of being wickedly Judaized.  After all, as even Karen states, Jerusalem was over 60% Jewish by 1900.  And, in fact, the Jewish percentage of the city hasn't changed much since then, even though the surrounding area has become far more Jewish.  This sort of blatant bias made Armstrong look more like a Hamas gun moll than a serious scholar.<br /><br />There are plenty of facts in this book, but Armstrong's tendency to invert truth makes it appear that she wrote the book just to attack the human rights of a few non-Muslims.  Avoid this paean to hatred, racism and intolerance.	2004-10-21

It manifested itself in widespread defamation of Jews, attacks on European Jews in particular, a series of horrible anti-Jewish laws, and an environment in which the combination of attacks on Jews and anti-Jewish propaganda caused Jews in general to become increasingly despised.  So despised that it was possible to murder millions of them in World War 2.<br /><br />That is not exactly what is happening today.  For the most part, Jews are faring well, and very few have been murdered.  But anti-Jewish propaganda (much of it \\"antizionist\\") is widespread, especially in the Arab world.  This book describes where things stand, and it notes the intensity of anti-Jewish propaganda in the Arab world, clearly showing that \\"the parallels between Nazism and the current Arab-Muslim brand of anti-Semitism are striking.\\"  It also shows how Arabs are training many of their children to be antisemites.<br /><br />A chapter on Europe shows a striking correlation between Arab attacks on Israelis and local attacks on European Jews.  I hadn't realized the extent to which terrorist attacks inspire violence elsewhere, but the author also explained that \\"the September 11 terrorist attack on America led to a sharp increase in European violence against Jews,\\" with dramatically increased incidents of violence in England and France in the months of September and October, 2001.<br /><br />The author says that antisemitism is a grossly delusional view of the world and its implications continue to reach far beyond the fate of the Jews.  I agree, and that's a reason I think this book is important for everyone.	2004-10-21

Many of us were captivated by \\"Darkness at Noon,\\" \\"Thieves in the Night,\\" Promise and Fulfilment,\\" \\"The Sleepwalkers,\\" \\"The Trail of the Dinosaur,\\" and many other great works.  This book, from 1976, is about the Khazars, a people of Turkish stock that lived to the northeast of the Black Sea and converted to Judaism in the eighth century AD.<br /><br />The obvious question, which had been asked by many people prior to Koestler, is to what extent the Khazars are the ancestors of the Ashkenazic Jews.  Koestler suspected it is to a great extent.<br /><br />I think there is substantial evidence that many Khazars did in fact convert to Judaism.  And there is also some evidence that the initial number of Jews who wound up in the major Jewish population centers of Eastern Europe via the Middle East and Germany was rather small.  That suggested to Koestler that the presumably more numerous Khazars dominated the Jewish population in Eastern Europe 1000 years ago and that they are the principal ancestors of today's Ashkenazic Jews.  However, it seems that recent scholarship has not given much support to this guess.  On the contrary, genetic evidence has strongly indicated that the small number of Jews coming from Germany may well have been by far the main ancestors of today's Ashkenazim.<br /><br />As Koestler feared, his hypothesis has been quoted by those trying to find an excuse to deny present-day Israelis their rights to their homes.  That is why Koestler explains that whether the genes of Israel's people are of Khazar, Spanish, Roman, or Semitic origin is irrelevant.  It \\"cannot affect Israel's right to exist - nor the moral obligation of any civilized person, Gentile or Jew - to defend that right.\\"<br /><br />In any case, I found the book interesting.	2004-10-21

Democrat Al Gore received more popular votes than Republican George W Bush, but such elections are decided state by state, and the winner in Florida was to determine who would be President.  In Florida, more voters intended to vote for Gore than for Bush, but due to several irregularities, the vote was very close.  Close enough to require a mandatory recount.  Close enough so that either candidate could ask for a hand count of disputed ballots.<br /><br />As it turned out, a complete recount of all ballots would have confirmed that Gore had won.  According to Florida law, such a recount should have been performed.  When a recount got under way, it grew increasingly clear that Gore might well win.  However, the Republican strategy (in a state where Bush's brother was the governor) was to refuse a recount or to delay any recount until the Presidential winner had to be announced.  If the Democrats protested, they would take the case to court.  To the Supreme Court.  And if they lost that case, they would simply have the Florida legislature declare Bush the winner of the state.  Either way, Bush would win an illegitimate victory.<br /><br />Given that the initial count favored Bush, a Republican victory could not be prevented.  And even in the unlikely event that a complete hand count (including \\"overvotes\\") favored Bush, neutral observers would still note that a plurality of the Florida voters had tried to vote for Gore, and that Florida law was to favor the clear intent of the voters.  So the illegitimacy of the result was inevitable no matter how the hand count came out.  The only question was where the blame would rest.  Would it be on those in Florida who delayed the count?  On the Florida legislature?  On the Florida Courts?  Or on the Supreme Court?<br /><br />Dershowitz explains how the blame wound up being applied, quite accurately, to the Supreme Court, which took a case and judged it purely on a partisan basis.  And he explains what the result of this mischief will be.  First, unlike a miscarriage of justice in a criminal case, which might get blamed on the jurors, the Supreme Court judges are there for life.  They'll be considered untrustworthy by a huge number of people for the rest of their lives, and that will make the Supreme Court less credible as long as any of them remain on it.  Dershowitz also says that it will call into much greater question the entire process by which Supreme Court judges are selected.  And of course, this entire affair has exposed the absurdities of our voting system to the world, which regards us with less esteem as a result.<br /><br />Many Americans were annoyed with the Supreme Court simply because it picked someone other than the person they voted for. Others were angry because it picked the loser rather than the winner. However, Dershowitz is more concerned with the Supreme Court having showed partisanship at all, especially in a manner that threatens the carefully established checks and balances among branches of government so carefully laid out in our Constitution.<br /><br />Finally, Dershowitz reminds us that the authority of the Supreme Court \\"rests on public acceptance of its status as a nonpartisan arbiter of law.\\"  Judicial integrity gets built up slowly and in this case was squandered quickly.

Simpson Got Away With Murder	Books	5	6	9	N	N	The final word on the OJ case	This book powerfully clears up the case against OJ Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.  As Bugliosi explains, there was no mystery in the case itself.  It was open and shut.  The only mystery was how a jury managed to acquit a manifest double murderer.  And this book supplies much of the answer to this mystery.  It shows in detail how he would have presented the case against OJ.<br /><br />Bugliosi assuredly would have presented a stronger case for the prosecution.  And let's give him the benefit of the doubt, maybe he'd have won that case.  But given the overwhelming evidence against OJ, what does that tell us?  It tells us that in cases where a criminal has good lawyers, you'll get better justice by flipping a coin than by having a jury trial.  And if expensive trials are worthless, what does that say about cheap trials?  It puts the entire American criminal justice system in doubt.  That is one reason to read this book and see some of the places where the system failed.<br /><br />Even had OJ been found guilty, there were plenty of high profile cases that already cast grave doubt on the usefulness of jury trials.  But this one took the cake, particularly since so many observers felt that there would be a conviction after reasonable jury deliberation, not an acquittal after virtually no deliberation at all.  Again, this book helps show why so many observers were so convinced that even the case as presented was airtight.<br /><br />Some people believe that, as in the Rodney King case (another grave miscarriage of justice), the issue was race.  But the defense in a criminal trial almost always comes up with an issue other than guilt.  So I agree with the author's claim that a conviction was obtainable with the actual jury. I also agree that the actual result \\"had an injurious effect on Americans' faith in the jury system.\\" And I even agree that there is still hope for the jury system.  However, I think this case shows that dramatic changes still need to be made for the jury system to be worthwhile.  And it is sad that until that happens, we'll see an disgraceful and unnecessary number of guilty people going free and innocent people being convicted.  Bugliosi thoughtfully discusses some of the recommendations to improve trials that were made at the time.<br /><br />Read this book to see just how poorly the system performed here.tic changes still need to be made for the jury system to be worthwhile.

Those of us who support human rights realize that without justice and truth, we won't have rights.  So we're tempted to agree with an author who asks for \\"justice.\\"<br /><br />The problem is that the word \\"justice\\" is misused here, just as the word \\"socialism\\" was by the National Socialists, or the word \\"democratic\\" by the German Democratic Republic, or the word \\"racism\\" by the United Nations.  For those who want a discussion of justice, I recommend \\"A Theory of Justice\\" by John Rawls.<br /><br />I think of justice as fairness.  Before saying what is just, I think Ateek would have done well to pretend that he didn't know whether he happened to be Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or Pagan.  And as a minimum, he had to realize that demanding everything for himself by right (even if he generously gave some crumbs to others) is neither fair nor just.<br /><br />Of course, the whole point of Ateek's dishonest book is to deny justice to Jews so that Jews can be denied human rights as well.  It represents a Marcionite point of view, namely a takeoff on Christianity that tosses the Old Testament into the trash basket.  While those who don't subscribe to monotheism may applaud this attitude towards the Old Testament, it is a little surprising coming from a Christian clergyman.<br /><br />In real life, just about the time when Zionism was about to establish a Jewish state, with hundreds of thousands of Jews already in what is now Israel, genocide in Europe killed most of the Jews who were intending to move to the region.  This genocide was abetted by many Arabs, especially by helping to convince the British to stop most Jewish immigration to the region in 1939.  Well, Ateek admits that there has been genocidal behavior.  But to him, the Arabs are innocent victims, and the Jews, while victims in World War 2, have been perpetrators against the Arabs. And he's willing to forgive the Jews for all this.  But only if the Jews apologize for a fabricated set of misdeeds.<br /><br />The scariest thing about this book is what it does to the image of Christians in the area.  I can only imagine how thoroughly Ateek is despised by honest people.  And this can't be good for the rest of the Arab Christians, many of whom are obviously decent people and deserve far better representation than this.about this book is what it does to the image of Christians in the area.

Real people in real life do real things for real reasons.  But after reading this book, I had an image of wicked unarmed Zionists maliciously stealing land from hapless heavily armed Arabs.  It wasn't exactly what Smith had said.  But it was close enough to make me realize what was wrong with the book.  The constant whitewashing of Arab misdeeds and criticism of reasonable Jewish behavior had simply erased the motivations for the two sides in the conflict.    Are there books that do a better job?  Oh yes.

Islam is a way of life, and she'd rather not have to abandon it.  However, there are some problems with it that she wishes were not there.  These include oppression of women, rejection of homosexuals, and intolerance of those of other religions, especially of Jews.  Manji doubts that these problems need to be inherent in Islam, but she also notes the reluctance of her religion to reform on such matters.  As the book cover implies, with Manji's mouth covered, today's Islam is reluctant to even discuss such questions.  And these problems affect her directly.<br /><br />There are side-effects of these problems that also bother Manji.  These include a lack of competitiveness of much of the Islamic world with the rest of society, economically, academically, and socially.  That includes involvement in a number of wars which have made the term \\"suicide bomber\\" almost always associated with Islam.  Once again, yet another concern has been the tendency for authorities in the Islamic world to deny such problems or blame them on others.  Meanwhile, the rest of the world is getting a less and less favorable impression of Islam, given the poverty, illiteracy, aggression, and dishonesty they see originating from it.<br /><br />Manji's solution has been to speak out about all this and encourage others to do so as well.  Can we blame her?  Shouldn't we encourage her?  Maybe we all ought to try to improve things for those around us, as she does.	2004-10-17

It is an impressive recounting of the author's coming to grips with the nearly surreal racism, irrationality, and hatred he discovered among segments of the Arab world.  Everyone ought to read this book to realize what the terror we're at war with is all about.  But be prepared: Timmerman does not mince words.<br /><br />Timmerman reminds us that \\"war without a victor and a vanquished is still war,\\" as we've seen many times in the past century.  One reason we haven't seen the kind of peace that followed World War 2 is that whenever Israel has defeated Arabs in battle, Europe and the United States have made sure to guarantee an inconclusive result. The Arabs, being neither crushed nor forced to apologize nor even forced to stop incitement towards future adventures, would inevitably be encouraged to fight again.  Timmerman says that \\"it is time to reconsider such policies.\\"<br /><br />It is true that this book emphasizes one side of the war between Israel and the Arabs.  However, Timmerman takes the trouble to explain why the two sides are not symmetrical.  As he says, visions of an Israeli victory would likely \\"resemble what we have seen over the past fifty years: Jewish sovereignty over borders defined by Israel as defensible, with full citizenship offered to Arabs who choose to live peacefully within them.\\"  On the other hand, today's Arab children are being taught that peace requires the removal of all the region's Jews.  Timmerman asks which of these outcomes risks a new \\"Holocaust.\\"  He shows us that under Arab rule, the vanquished Jews would be likely to lose their rights, including their rights to life.	2004-10-16

Some simply want to make America stronger.  Others want the United States to make reasonable sacrifices to make the world as a whole a better place.  But that's not what this book is about.  This book is about those who wish to hurt the United States and whose advice to us has to be suspect.  It is, in particular, about allegiances between portions of the American political Left and Islamic radicals, and the influence of this on American politics and on the war against terror.<br /><br />Horowitz pins down the problem to an \\"anti-American cult\\" which argues that \\"America can do no right, even the right America does is wrong, and the wrongs America is responsible for are monstrous.\\"  This view explains the alliances of this group with Soviet Communism, with Castro, with Arafat, and with others whom they perceive to be enemies of America.<br /><br />As evidence, Horowitz cites the surprising willingness of some on the Left to defend fundamentalist Islamist theocracies that oppress women, homosexuals, and non-Muslims.  He makes a striking analogy with the opposition of American Communists to fighting against Hitler during the Nazi-Soviet pact interval from the end of the summer in 1939 to the start of the summer of 1941.  In my opinion, American Zionists on the Left (such as Francisco Gil-White) often regard Israel's alliance with the United States as inconsistent at best, while American antizionists on the Left generally regard Israel and the United States as partners in crime, and I think this is further evidence for what Horowitz is saying.<br /><br />Horowitz gives some examples of malicious, dishonest, and irresponsible attacks on the United States from the Left.  A good example is that by a Columbia University assistant professor who said, \\"Peace is subversive, because peace anticipates a very different world than the one in which we live - a world where the U.S. would have no place.\\"  Horowitz shows the strong similarities between the radical Islamist indictment of America and the indictments by some Americans on the political Left.  He then goes on to describe the infamous anti-American and anti-Israeli \\"conference against racism\\" held in Durban in September 2001, just before the attacks on the World Trade Center.  He shows that many of the organizations that participated in that event went on to systematically oppose America's war against terror.  One test of this opposition is defence of terrorists.  An example Horowitz gives is Sami al-Arian, a leader of one of the principal terrorist organizations in the Middle East.  When al-Arian was finally arrested in February, 2003, a number of groups sprang to his defense.  Some radicals defended him with full knowledge of his terrorist occupation.  Other more mainstream groups did so mostly because they were unaware of al-Arian's involvement in terrorism and swallowed the line that he was being persecuted for having a few unpopular views.  This is one way that Horowitz shows the threat that radical anti-American groups can pose to mainstream politics.  Although I feel that Horowitz is exaggerating this threat somewhat, I think we all ought to be aware of it.  I definitely recommend this book.ne in which we live - a world where the U.S. would have no place.\\"  Horowitz shows the strong similarities between the radical Islamist indictment of America and the indictments by some Americans on the political Left.

The portrayal of the effects of antisemitism on Jewish families was incredible.  I even thought the discussion of American postage stamps was a brilliant touch.  I was afraid the book would be depressing, but it wasn't.<br /><br />I was surprised to see Roth come up with an alternative history work.  The book did not stress issues of what would have happened internationally had America elected a pro-Axis President in 1940, but what effects there would have been on ordinary Americans, especially Jewish Americans, and how well-known Americans would have reacted to such circumstances.  It shows that antisemitism does not have to advance to the stage of mass killings to dramatically reduce the quality of life for its victims.<br /><br />Some folks will ask what political statement Roth is making with this novel.  My guess is that they ought to ask Roth.  But I couldn't fail to notice how negative his portrayal was of those Jews who sold out to the antisemites and how positively he supported those who opposed such opportunism.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and my guess is that you will too.	2004-10-16

The sponsors of the Oslo agreement of 1993 seemed to imply that Arafat represented people who wanted a fair division of land between Jews and Arabs and equal rights for both Jews and Arabs in the region.  And that Arafat and his negotiators would be in favor of peace, justice, truth, and good behavior by both sides, in keeping with what was expected by society at large.<br /><br />That is not what Commentary thought.  Its articles tended to imply that Arafat and his gang were thugs who wanted to incite and sacrifice Arabs to benefit only themselves at best.  To Commentary, the goals of Arafat's side were to destroy Israel, reduce or obliterate human rights for Jews, and rewrite and fabricate Arab and Jewish history.  And Arafat's main demand seemed to be for the enshrinement of his right to perform all these misdeeds with worldwide blessing, approval, and applause.<br /><br />Roughly speaking, Commentary's articles indicated that the dubiously named Peace Process would fail because neither side's goals would be met.  In addition, they showed that any concession demanded of Israel by the Arabs, if granted, was almost invariably designed to reduce the prospects for peace.  Meanwhile, it appeared that the international community was prepared to allow the Arab side to break its promises, and apply serious pressure only on Israel.  In addition, Arab incitement against Israel was unlikely to lessen, and international propagation of Arab propaganda was expected to increase.<br /><br />Sure enough, Oslo failed.  And we can and should read the articles from Commentary that compose this book.  I think the best of them is the one by Fiamma Nirenstein.  However, let's face it: Commentary was basically claiming the Earth was round when it was politically correct to say that it was flat.  That took some courage, maybe plenty of courage, but not much brilliance.  At least, let's give Commentary credit for taking a moral and honest stand on this issue.	2004-10-16

And it attempts to defend a controversial thesis, namely that while life may be prevalent in the Universe, intelligent life is rare.<br /><br />The claim that life itself is at least as common as many others suspect is based on the ability of many \\"extremophiles\\" (some of which may resemble the initial forms of life on Earth) to subsist well outside what many observers would previously have called a \\"habitable environment.\\"  The authors also note the fact that unicellular life on Earth appears to have arisen fairly quickly.<br /><br />The claim that intelligent life is rare is based on the fact that multicellular animal life appears to require a large number of potentially difficult steps to evolve, and in fact took a relatively long time to develop on Earth.  The authors argue that many aspects of the Earth's nature and history are relatively rare, and that these aspects significantly increased the chance that intelligent life would develop as fast as it did.  In addition, the authors point out that the development of intelligent life requires being lucky at several key points.  For example, intelligent life on Earth required an oxygen-rich atmosphere.  This was provided by early unicellular life.  But the production of oxygen wrecked much of the \\"greenhouse effect\\" that had made the Earth's surface relatively warm.  The cooling of the Earth that resulted probably did not slow down the further evolution of life, if anything, the authors suspect that it speeded it up.  But on other planets, such a reduction of temperature would have been more likely to destroy life than enhance it.<br /><br />This is a very readable and interesting book, and I certainly recommend it.	2004-10-14

He has been a pioneer in the field of linguistics.  He helped restore a rationalistic approach to linguistics that has basically replaced the behavioralist approach of B. F. Skinner.<br /><br />Chomsky came up with the concept of context-free grammars, and developed many of their properties.  He showed the equivalence of regular grammars and finite automata, he showed the equivalence of context-free languages and push-down automata, and he showed the equivalence of grammatically computable functions and Turing-computable functions.  He has backed the idea that language acquisition in humans is largely innate, and the evidence for this idea seems to be increasing.  He's a very bright person who has made many genuine scholarly contributions to society.<br /><br />Even Chomsky's approach to social issues has had some positive aspects.  While many people have addressed national policy issues principally in pragmatic terms, Chomsky has emphasized moral issues.  He has wisely advised us to avoid resolving debates on moral issues purely on pragmatic grounds.  And he has advised us to be wary of the role of the media in obtaining popular consent for dubious policies.<br /><br />On the other hand, Chomsky has had misadventures as well.  Some of the linguistics principles he has proposed have been shown to be false.  And his opinion that language acquisition ability in humans has not developed via Darwinian evolution has exposed him to ridicule from most biologists.  In addition, he failed to notice the tendency of Cambodians (as opposed to Vietnamese) to welcome the presence of American troops nor the extent of the destruction of Cambodia (and the slaughter of Cambodians) wreaked by the Communists after our departure.  Chomsky has been extremely reluctant to admit any of these errors.<br /><br />Politically, there is much worse.  Chomsky has allied himself with some incredibly extreme and antisemitic reactionaries.  And he's simply opposed America and our allies, rather than providing any constructive criticism.  His attacks on America and Israel have justifiably led many Americans, Jews, humanitarians, and scholars to feel betrayed.  This book shows how serious this problem is and how counterproductive Chomsky has become in the political arena.<br /><br />Still, what impressed me most about the book was its convincing evidence that Chomsky, especially in political matters, is dishonest, coming up with fabrications, misquotes, and evasions to mislead his readers.  It's these deceptions that most appall me about him.  And I feel that the authors deserve a great deal of credit for pointing out his tendency to engage in them.e's simply opposed America and our allies, rather than providing any constructive criticism.

And he has a solution:  reduce the threat of terror by getting out of the land that was under Arab occupation in 1966.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the argument for doing this is unconvincing.  And there are some strong arguments for doing something else.  One is that ethnically cleansing the West Bank of its Jews is already a serious abrogation of human rights.  Another is that it may well encourage Arab terror even more if the interim result of it is to gain general acceptance of Arab rights to steal Jewish land.  I was not impressed by the author's grasp of such problems.  Van Creveld may be correct that a fence separating the Jews and Arabs is a good idea.  But there is no good reason to put even the heavily Jewish portions of the West Bank on the Arab side of the fence even when these areas are adjacent to the 1966 Israeli border.	2004-10-13

Should Jews have human rights? And the answer provided by the authors in this volume is, in effect, no.  If you agree, then this book is for you!<br /><br />There's no doubt that there's been plenty of Arab violence since the breakdown of peace talks at the end of the Clinton administration.  Well, this book doesn't apologize for it.  It merely boasts about it!<br /><br />What about apartheid and racism?  There's plenty of it in this book.  And making sure there are no Jews in the West Bank is, of course, ethnic cleansing.<br /><br />This is truly one-sided propaganda against human rights.	2004-10-13

That is the main problem with the book.  Oh, sure, there is no consideration for human rights, not for Arab rights nor Jewish rights.  But the big problem is a lack of honesty, after which any recommendations that are made become suspect.<br /><br />What is the best way to end the war of 1948, in which five Arab nations tried to get rid of Israel, a nation that formed because it was the only way to defend Jewish rights of life, liberty, and property in the region?  In my opinion, I think some way needs to be found to get Israel's neighbors to grant the Jews of Israel these basic rights!  But you'll never see this issue in Reinhart's book.	2004-10-13

Or would they merely be a collection of anti-semitic articles?  It turned out to be the latter.<br /><br />I looked at page 1 and found:<br /><br />\\"I think we should almost never take anti-semitism seriously, and maybe we should have some fun with it.\\"<br /><br />Well, there might be an argument for this, I suppose.  One of the times to have taken anti-semitism seriously should have been in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s.  But perhaps the point was precisely that deaths caused by anti-semitic attacks have been almost nothing in the past few years compared with deaths due to antisemitism in World War 2.<br /><br />On the other hand, one aspect of today's anti-semitism is indeed serious, namely the incitement against Jews in the Muslim world.  One symptom of this has been numerous suicide bombings. This is a global problem, and a problem for the Arab world in particular.  Was this what the book would encourage us to trivialize and have fun with?  Unfortunately it was.	2004-10-10

It points out that although for the UN to work, \\"it must be a serious forum for debate and decision,\\" it instead \\"corrupts debate by giving propaganda a dignity it could never otherwise achieve.\\"  In addition, this book encourages the US to \\"take direct action against UN organizations such as UNRWA (which is a front for terror) that do active harm.\\"<br /><br />Still, I feel that the author may be in error when he says that John Kerry, if elected, would \\"put American foreign policy at the mercy of the United Nations.\\"  After all, the UN is a problem for liberals, moderates, and conservatives, for Republicans and Democrats alike.  I think it would have been more appropriate simply to encourage both parties to help counter it.  And I think that the author's own recommendation to build on growing disillusion with the UN could help do this.	2004-10-10

And she stands behind what she's written.  It is an exciting narrative which keeps one's interest throughout.<br /><br />Most people in America truly enjoy the benefits of living in this country.  A few, however, are terrorists or inciters for terrorism and have it both ways: they enjoy the American way of life while they try to destroy it.  And the author is definitely performing a heroic service to everyone by opposing such folks and warning us about them.<br /><br />The author shows something of the surprising and annoying extent to which some Muslim \\"charities\\" have actually been mere fronts for terror.  Even more annoying is the amount of time it has taken to round up well-known terrorist leaders, such as Sami al-Arian.  The author explains some of the reasons why such people have been left at large for so long after their guilt has become apparent.<br /><br />I recommend this book for everyone.  Terrorism and incitement are problems for us all.  The more we become aware of which groups are actually terrorist fronts, the better.	2004-10-08

There are arguments of all sorts about the existence of God.  There are comments on the arguments from various people and comments on the comments.  I certainly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Moreland, as the Theist, gave several arguments for the existence of a Supreme Being (although I have to admit that he didn't include my favorite of them, the ontological one). Nielsen's argument for atheism was essentially the positivistic one: that key religious claims are unfalsifiable and therefore meaningless.<br /><br />But there were a couple of surprises.  First, Moreland made a serious effort to rebut Nielsen's arguments, saying that God is in fact detectable and that therefore key religious statements are indeed verifiable.  And second, Moreland used some scientific arguments to bolster his claim!  This surprised me, given that Moreland's understanding of the Science he was using appeared to be somewhat shallow.  Also, scientists play for keeps.  When a scientific theory gets shot down, it's generally as dead as a doornail.  I was wondering if Moreland really wanted to play for such stakes.<br /><br />Some people were surprised that Nielsen used only one argument.  I wasn't: it is a powerful argument and it is all he needed.  Still, I was surprised by a couple of things from him.  First, he dismissed the belief in existence of Zeus as plainly false and superstitious.  I think such statements, while they may be valid, are subject to as much debate as the main topic.  Second, I expected Nielsen to say that the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus was weak.  He didn't do that.  Instead he said that even if he were to concede that Jesus was resurrected, that would not be evidence in favor of the existence of a Supreme Being.<br /><br />All in all, a well-done book.	2004-10-08

It is carefully written, has an enormous amount of up-to-date information, and covers the subject reasonably well.  Astrobiology is a relatively new subject, and this is one of the best books about it.  I was very impressed by the amount of material Ulmschneider was able to cover in only 250 pages and how clearly he explained everything.  He went through the origin of the chemical elements, planet formation, the threat of planetary migration, the search for extrasolar planets, planetary atmospheric instabilities, theories on the origin of life on Earth, the evolution of life, the threats to the Earth's environment from the existence of life (such as the Huronic glaciation), the search for extraterrestrial life, and much more.

If one simply likes listening to the sonatas but has no intention of playing them, I wouldn't recommend this book, nor the ones by Tovey or Drake.  I'd suggest reading about them in a book about Beethoven's life, or maybe the chapter on them in Kentner's book on the piano.  But if you enjoy playing any or all of these sonatas, yes, you'll enjoy this book, with its emphasis on simplicity of style (which Rosen explains to us is the advice of Proust's grandmother).<br /><br />While there's good advice on phrasing, pedaling, and trills, the most interesting part of any book on the Beethoven sonatas is going to be about tempos.  This one is no exception.  The author points out that it is not illegal to play a piece of music at the wrong tempo.  One won't get a speeding ticket or a fine or a jail sentence for doing so. Still, even if a tempo seems comfortable to us, it may not be anything like what Beethoven had in mind, so it is useful to see what the correct tempos appear to be.  I like the fact that Rosen tries to discover what those who read Beethoven's tempo descriptions would have concluded at the time they were written, as opposed to relying on what Czerny, Moscheles, Schindler, or others might have said long afterwards.<br /><br />Rosen's comments are backed up with excerpts on an accompanying CD (played by Giulio Ricci).  I think these add substantially to the value of this book.<br /><br />And of course, if you play the piano but haven't tried the Beethoven sonatas, you are missing something truly special.	2004-10-06

It can take a bright reader who has no more than an undergraduate college degree in a technical field and bring that person to a point where they can read and understand technical papers about fundamental physics and cosmology.  It discusses these topics in a way not open to many books for the layman, since it has brought the reader up to speed on the necessary mathematics.  Some of the math can be skipped, of course, but it is there to bring the material to life.<br /><br />Of course, that means starting the book with over 350 pages of math, taught in impressive style by the author, including  Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry, number theory, complex numbers, logarithms, complex powers, real and complex calculus, Riemann surfaces, Fourier series, Vector fields, Quaternions, Manifolds, Symmetry groups, and Fibre bundles!  That allows him to proceed to discuss quantum mechanics and the rest of fundamental physics.<br /><br />It is true that Penrose does mention his views about inflation and string theory.  But the fact that he has views about these theories does not in any way stop him from being a great teacher.  He covers the field of fundamental physics very well indeed.<br /><br />Penrose does impart a very important viewpoint that I think is valuable for us all.  Most scientists are basically positivists: that is, they search for theories that will correspond to measurements (pass experimental tests and provide accurate predictions).  It is secondary to them what reality happens to be.  But there is something to be said for asking what the reality behind the physics actually is.<br /><br />If you are a very bright high school graduate about to go to some top notch university to try to become a theoretical physicist, read this book now!	2004-10-05

It not only discusses the Geneva Accord, a proposal for ending the Arab war against Israel, it also lists several objections to the Accord from both Arabs and Israelis, and comments on them.  This shows an unusual amount of honesty and sincerity in a book about this conflict.<br /><br />My complaints with the book are simply that it overlooks the major problems with the Accord in making its case.  These problems are as follows:<br /><br />First, when an aggressor has launched an attack on the rights of what it has deemed to be an inferior race, a solution to the conflict generally needs to involve a big apology from the aggressor and a sincere admission of guilt.  We've seen that in the case of the American South and and its treatment of the Blacks there by the Whites.  We've seen that in the case of the German Nazi treatment of Jews, Gypsies, and Slavs.  In this case, an Arab apology would be in order.  It is not clear that an Accord which overlooks such history will succeed.<br /><br />Second, let's suppose that for some reason, we all have to forget all previous history up to, literally, yesterday.  What changes in the status quo would we want to make now, even assuming that no one would make amends for anything?  Well, we'd probably want to have human rights, including those of life, liberty, and property, for everyone in the region.  That would mean refusing to ethnically cleanse any region, it would mean refusing to ban entire groups from an area on racial or religious grounds, and it would mean allowing people of all races or religions to buy land anywhere in the region and live on it.  But that would mean allowing both Jews and Arabs to live throughout the West Bank and even in Jordan or Saudi Arabia, which is pretty far from anything the Geneva Accord would imply.  Furthermore, given the number of Jews in the region, were everyone allowed to buy land freely at auction, the Jewish region would become considerably larger than present-day Israel, also something quite the opposite of what the Geneva Accord would permit.<br /><br />Third, for an agreement to work, it ought to offer something of strategic value to each side.  Well, this Accord fails to do that.  What the Israelis need is peace, but the Accord is unlikely to bring it.  What some Arabs say they want is a little land, but that surely isn't what they want nor is it what will get them to quit fighting.  What the Arabs appear to be fighting for right now is the right to obliterate the rights of the Jews of the Middle East, especially the Israeli Jews.  If the Arabs are not granted this request, the Accord will fail.  If they are granted this request, Israel and the Israelis will be left with nothing.  Before any accord can be reached, there needs to be some change in actual Arab demands, not merely in advertised ones.<br /><br />Fourth, there is every reason to believe that were such an Accord to be implemented, all that would happen is that the Arabs would use every Israeli concession tactically, as a means to try to destroy Israel entirely.  That is, this Accord could only be implemented in peacetime, not wartime.  And if peace requires the defeat of one or both sides, it isn't clear why an Accord will be needed after that.nsiderably larger than present-day Israel, also something quite the opposite of what the Geneva Accord would permit. <br /> <br />Third, for an agreement to work, it ought to offer something of strategic value to each side.

The purpose of the attack was not to protect anyone.  It was to obliterate human rights of Jews in the region.  In effect, the Arabs were fighting for pride while the Jews were fighting for their lives.  Not surprisingly, the Jews fought harder.  And the Jews won.<br /><br />Now some scholars have decided that the time has come to deny all this and rewrite this history, claiming not only that the Jews were arrogant aggressors, but that most Jews conspired to tell the same lies about it.  It certainly serves no purpose to blame the victims of the Arab invasion in such a manner.  If the cause the authors are fighting for loses, what will they have accomplished?  If their cause wins, they will have struck a very counterproductive blow against scholarship, justice, and human rights.	2004-10-02

The author is not a specialist in Middle East studies.  He's not saying anything new or original.  He's taken his material from an assortment of antizionist propaganda books.  He hasn't found any surprising new facts to divulge.  What's the point?<br /><br />Is the author helping anyone by coming up with such a misleading attack on Israel?  He isn't helping Israelis or Arabs: he's merely giving them more reasons to fight.  He's encouraging Arabs to kill Jews and encouraging Jews to defend themselves not only against Arabs but against antizionist lies.  As for those of us who are far away from the area, he's not helping us either by trying to misinform us all.  He didn't need to do this.

I think that it is more natural for humans, a varied and fickle bunch, to worship a large number of gods and goddesses.  I think that monotheistic theology makes little sense in many other ways.  I mistrust many monotheistic traditions and rules.  And I think that monotheistic versions of history are often terribly flawed.  I'm a polytheistic liberal humanist.<br /><br />However, in no way would I abide propaganda that serves to support religious wars against monotheism in general, nor against various monotheistic factions.  That goes for Jezebel fighting Jews, Pagans fighting Christians, the Crusades, various Muslim jihads, Saint Bartholomew's night, and so forth.  Nor do I think that one ought to deprive monotheist factions of human rights.  And this book serves to encourage just this sort of thing.  Far from being a sober critique of monotheism or Judaism, it is simply a collection of misrepresentations of Judaism which are so extreme that they serve to encourage violence against Jews.	2004-10-02

When Arabs committed acts of war against Israel, causing this small nation to decide to defend itself, it was really a premeditated expansionist plot by Israel!  And when Israel asked Arabs for peace, it was proof that this small nation that needed peace to exist in the Middle East in fact preferred war and death!<br /><br />When Israel, in wartime, made a mistake and killed some allies, that was a deep and sinister plot too!  And when it liberated Eastern Jerusalem, which had been the de facto Jewish capital for millenia, this was actually an international crime.<br /><br />Oh, there's more.  When Canada commits the sin of trading with Israel, Hadawi threatens it, saying that Canada needs the Arab world far more than the Arab world needs Canada.  This book boasts about the Arab boycotts of Israel, the Arab success in passing the infamous \\"Zionism-racism\\" slander in the United Nations, and the Arab attacks on Israel in 1948.<br /><br />You might think that the author would see a reason why the Jews didn't like the White Paper of 1939, which condemned hundreds of thousands of them to death by keeping them from fleeing Nazi lands and moving to their internationally recognized refuge in what is now Israel.  But he scoffs at all this, saying that the Jewish misfortunes in Europe actually helped the Zionists by allowing the few survivors to move to Israel!  I wonder what he would have thought of a world in which a few million more survivors had existed?<br /><br />To top it off, you would think that the author realizes that no matter how good or bad Israelis are, they probably appreciate the fact that Israel protects their lives, liberty, and property!  But no, he ascribes the interest of Jews in staying alive and keeping their possessions to fanatical and wacky fundamentalist religious views.<br /><br />Actually, yes, you probably should read this book.

No.  But it is the best of them.<br /><br />A book about the denial of human rights to non-Whites in the antebellum American South would not be flattering to slave owners.  Similarly, this book is not flattering to those who deny rights to non-Muslims.  While being a \\"dhimmi\\" literally means being \\"protected,\\" the word is used in the same sense as \\"protection money.\\"  \\"Dhimmitude\\" is basically the denial of human rights to non-Muslims.<br /><br />Bat Ye'or points out three aspects of dhimmitude.  First is political, the invariable choice to oppose rights for non-Muslims.  Second is historical, the construction of a set of arbitrary lies and taunts regarding non-Muslims, a denial and destruction of non-Muslim history, and the invention of a bogus Muslim history.  Third is theological, the development of religious attacks on non-Muslims and the generation of specifically anti-Jewish and anti-Christian theologies.<br /><br />Bat Ye'or is at her best when she shows how all this has played out in real life.  She shows how dhimmitude has led to inter-dhimmi conflicts, with Christians leaving the Middle East in droves while those Christians who remain are pressured to renounce the Old Testament and join (or even lead) the attacks on Jewish rights in Israel.	2004-09-26

This book tries to present Ashrawi (a Christian Arab woman) as a voice of reason.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ashrawi's support of Islamic terror has put her squarely against both Christian rights and women's rights.  Her role as education minister for Arafat has helped destroy the rights of a generation of Arabs.  And if what she's done to her friends isn't bad enough, you might want to see how uncharitable she is to her enemies.  She's a voice of irrationality and destruction.  It's a shame that it will take more than a Dorothy from the Middle West to undo the damage she's done.<br /><br />Christians are fleeing the Middle East in droves, and Ashrawi is part of the reason.  This book should get no stars for failing to show Ashrawi's actual nature.	2004-08-23

If Israel were anywhere near as ruthless as this book pretends, the ISM wouldn't dare go there.<br /><br />Before I read this book, I thought that the ISM members were basically well-meaning folks who had been misled.  It was this book that made me realize just how malicious the ISM actually is and how much it has opposed truth, justice, peace, and human rights.<br /><br />What is to be done about the ISM?  Well, I think education is the answer.  A slow but steady diet of truth eventually dramatically reduced cigarette smoking in our land.  Perhaps the same sort of campaign will make ISM membership less attractive as well.  And I think we have a duty to warn our friends that the ISM's behavior is irresponsible and counterproductive.	2004-08-22

The questions they raise are not whether what Said comes up with is accurate, but whether they are intended to mislead, taunt, or a little of each.<br /><br />In my opinion, Ed Said is not the first human being to have ever told a lie, merely the first to have told so many of them.  He built up an impeccable reputation for dishonesty, racism, and support for terror over a period of decades.  He once wrote, \\"it is one of the great ironies of history that in the middle of the twentieth century - in the Golden age of peoples' rights to self-determination,\\" something was \\"dropped from the map of the world.\\"  Want to guess what that something was?  My guess would have been Tibet.  But no!  It's the British Mandate!  That's like complaining about dropping Gold Coast in favor of Ghana.<br /><br />Still, there are clear elements of taunting when he constantly calls those who disagree with him liars.  Obviously, Israel wants peace.  To call the Knesset Speaker a brazen liar for saying so is simply a taunt.  And to say that \\"it's the classic Zionist ploy to defame people by identifying criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism\\" is a taunt as well.<br /><br />Said has said that the 1947 Partition Plan was unfair, \\"based on the minority getting rights equal to those of the majority.\\"  Um, wow.  That's Said's racism, showing through loud and clear.<br /><br />Said's favorite targets are those who oppose terror, namely the ones who cooperate with authorities.  As Edward Alexander has pointed out, Said has even claimed that \\"the UN Charter and every other known document or protocol entitles a people under foreign occupation not only to resist but also by extension to deal severely with collaborators.\\"<br /><br />In the present volume, Said simply spews more of the same trash.  He deplores the fact that Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount (which happens to be Judaism's holiest site, is in Israel, and is in Jerusalem, Israel's capital).  Said accuses Sharon of trying to establish a right for an Israeli to visit what he misleadingly refers to as a Muslim holy place.<br /><br />Said has plenty of harsh words for the fact that some Jews live in the disputed West Bank.  To him, this is illegal and immoral.  But he has no complaints about Arabs living on the same disputed land!<br /><br />Said has nothing bad to say about the dozens of antizionist United Nations resolutions.  Instead, he attacks Israel for \\"flouting\\" them!<br /><br />Said is quick to tell us that little Israel is just too big.  Too big?  Um, why would that be?  Are ten thousand square miles just more than Israelis can afford?  Is it just too much land for 6 million Israelis, 5 million of whom are Jewish and are not desired as potential residents of any neighboring states?  Is it too much land, given that there are millions of Diaspora Jews, some of whom might want to move there?  Said doesn't ask this!<br /><br />In any case, about four-fifths of the Mandate (35,400 out of 46,300 square miles) in which Jews were given a Right to settle in 1920 by the international community was closed to Jews by the British in 1921, and given to what is now the state of Jordan.  That means the Jews have to make do with only a fifth of the land orignally set aside for them.  And sure enough, Said does say something about someone losing 78% of the land!  But he says the Arabs lost it!  That Israel not only stole 78% of that last 10,100 square miles (as if Jewish land is the only land Arabs can live on), but now wants even more of it!  Would you care to guess how many square miles of land the Arabs have?<br /><br />The fact that Israel has any land at all is more than enough justification for Said to call Israel greedy.  And he calls it immoral to complain about the terrorist attacks on Israel.  After all, as he points out, more Arabs have been dying in these attacks than Jews!  Of course, if Arabs didn't rush out to find Jews and attack them, neither side would be fighting or dying.<br /><br />It's sad that our species includes some bad apples.  The author of this book is one of the very worst of them.that our species includes some bad apples.  The author of this book is one of the very worst of them.	2004-08-22

What the reader gets instead is some amazing fascist propaganda that won't truly serve anyone.<br /><br />Hirst writes for the Guardian, a rather famous British newspaper that took decades to establish a fine reputation for its journalism.  It is staggering to realize just how much damage the Guardian has done to this reputation in just a short while by permitting such nonsense to invade its pages.  And I think we need to ask ourselves how and why this has happened.<br /><br />The staff of the Guardian has to be professional.  One would think that they would hesitate to destroy their paper in such a manner.  After all, it would cost the paper money.  It might ruin the paper entirely, and put them out of jobs.  One might suppose it unlikely that they would want to violate any semblence of good journalistic practice just to hurt a few Jews or Israelis.<br /><br />However, the experience of reading this book and seeing some of the reviews has led me to a hypothesis of what has happened.  The destruction of the Guardian's reputation as a conduit of good journalism has not put it out of business at all.  Just as this book has brought money to its author, the ghastly articles in the Guardian bring money to the newspaper, if only by appearing sensational and controversial.<br /><br />I think we readers have a duty to try to reverse this trend.  Just as dedicated people have made great progress in the campaign against cigarette smoking, the same can be done in the campaign against bad journalism.  We can warn our friends about books such as this one.  And we ought to do just that.	2004-08-22

On every topic the author tries to be coherent, moderate, and sympathetic rather than overly critical, and I think he succeeds.  The result is that the reader has a tendency to appreciate Fein's points rather than be overly critical in response.<br /><br />Fein points out that it is unlikely that the American Jewish community will survive \\"except as a community organized around values.\\"  He discusses topics such as antisemitism, the role of Israel, and neoconservatism.  And he has plenty of thoughtful things to say.<br /><br />Still, I think that he ought to have been able to better define the line between constructive criticism of Israeli policies and counterproductive support of antizionist enemies of Jewish rights.  Given that he reminds us, quoting Hillel, \\"if I am not for myself, who will be for me,\\" I think he has accepted as a test for himself the following question (posed by Edward Alexander, who is highly critical of Fein): Do you refuse to demand for yourself the rights you demand for others?<br /><br />I think Fein does not pass this test when it comes to Israel.  It is not that Fein fails to realize that being generous to one's enemies threatens one's friends: he does discuss the sense of betrayal that some Jews feel when their co-religionists attack Israel in apparaent concert with those who genuinely wish Jews ill.  Nor is it my claim that Fein ought to change his political views.  I simply think that Fein missed an opportunity to explore how one can refuse to support the government of Israel without risking being thought of as a traitor.	2004-08-19

One might think that antisemitism is an opinion like any other.  If it were, many antisemitic arguments would be logical, perhaps to explain why Jews are, as a people, just too different or too unhelpful to society at large, and explaining why something needs to be done about it.  In addition, most antagonism to Jews would be the results of actual provocations.<br /><br />Sartre convincingly shows that the majority of antisemitic discourse is quite different, consisting instead of taunts and threats.  \\"Never believe,\\" cautions Sartre, \\"that the antisemites are unaware of the absurdity of their replies.\\"  It's all part of the fun, given that their adversaries are the ones who believe in words and thus oblige themselves to use words responsibly.<br /><br />This is a perceptive study and is well worth reading.	2004-08-19

The poor ones can serve to put into perspective the points made by the good ones, adding rather than subtracting from the work as a whole.  But in this case, the majority of the articles are unimpressive.<br /><br />The first article, by Daniel Guttwein, is about \\"post-Zionism,\\" and it makes the surprisingly powerful point that post-Zionism strives to make Zionist history loathsome in order to delegitimize any Israeli collective memory.  The second article is by Uri Ram, on the role of Zionist nationalism in Jewish thought.  Anita Shapira then discusses strategies of historical revisionism from both right and left (in keeping with the title), in a surprisingly unconvincing essay, in which she attacks an equally unconvincing work by Hazony.  Next comes another critique of Hazony, this time by Mark Lilla.  The fifth article, by Derek Penslar, claims that Zionism was not colonial at all ... until after the 1967 war.  I found this quite unimpressive.<br /><br />Sixth is an essay by Avi Bareli about why Zionism isn't colonialism.  It is well-written, but still, I think the issue of whether Zionism is colonial in nature is rather secondary.  The seventh article, by Yoav Gelber, is the best.  It is about the status of Zionist and Israeli history at Israeli universities, and it begins with the Tantura thesis scandal, in which a Master's thesis invented a war crime at Tantura in the 1948 war....only to have the accused Alexandroni brigade sue for libel.<br /><br />By far the weakest of the contributions is the final one, by Amnon Raz-Krakotzkin, on history textbooks and the limits of Israeli consciousness.  It whitewashes all Arab anti-Israeli behavior.  It falsely claims that Israeli schoolbooks on all grade levels avoid any mention of the history of the land.  It makes a hypocritical plea for more accuracy in discussing Arabs.  And it finishes by blaming Israel for the plight of Arab refugees, saying that Israel has refused to help Arab refugees in spite of United Nations demands when the opposite is more nearly the case.<br /><br />I expected a work edited by a scholar like Anita Shapira to be much better than this.refugees in spite of United Nations demands when the opposite is more nearly the case.

Special attention is given to \\"some of the more brazen and flamboyant combatants\\" in what Alexander calls \\"the Jewish wars,\\"  such as Ed Said, Pat Buchanan, and Alex Cockburn.  The book takes issue with people from all parts of the political spectrum.<br /><br />One test that Alexander applies to Jewish critics of Israel is this: do they refuse to demand for themselves the same rights that they demand for others?  While I think that Alexander thus underestimates the value of the writings of David Grossman and Leonard Fein, I have to agree that it is significant that they do not pass this test.<br /><br />Alexander reserves his sharpest criticism for those who are politically committed to deny human rights to Jews.  While Alexander exposes many misstatements by antizionists, he does not lose focus on the goals of those who write them.  His main criticism of Ed Said is not for Said's \\"longstanding habit of confidently reciting the most preposterous falsehoods\\" but for Said's demands for the \\"right\\" to murder \\"collaborators\\" with Israel.<br /><br />This is not a typical discussion of the Arab war against Israel, but given the biases and weaknesses of most books on the topic that can be found on college campuses today, I think it is a welcome addition to the bookshelf.	2004-08-17

It has extensive quotes from no less than 67 documents that are relevant to the conflict, along with five tables, two charts, and 23 maps.  And it does supply plenty of facts.<br /><br />But this book completely misses the big picture, partially due to bias and partially due to poor scholarship.  Absurdly irrelevant events, such as Arafat saying (for the thirtieth time) that he might do something to promote peace, are given star treatment when they deserve no mention at all.  Major aspects of the conflict, such as the training of a generation of Arabs to be nihilistic antisemites, get little attention.  It is taken for granted that small details about borders are the main issues: the possibility that the fight is over something as fundamental as human rights is discounted.<br /><br />The authors explicitly realize that the task of the historian is to determine truth, explain it, weed out lies, infer as yet unknown details, and predict the future.  They simply fail in that task.  Not only do they implicitly accept many manifest fabrications (only to take out their suspicions on those who ought not be mistrusted without good cause), they often fail to distinguish between errors of judgment and outright malice.  It is sad to see such problems with what could have been a far more useful reference.	2004-08-17

Prager and Telushkin come up with four answers.  First, an inability to abide ethical monotheism in general and Judaism specifically.  Second, an insistence on ascribing great significance to the concept of Jewish \\"chosenness.\\"  Third, resentment of the high quality of Jewish life.  And fourth, an eagerness to blame Jews in general for the policies of non-Jewish Jews, coupled with an eagerness to praise non-Jewish Jews for their attacks on Judaism.<br /><br />These conclusions are not at all obvious.  For example, hostility to Jews might be caused primarily by Jews being different, easy to identify, and relatively weak.  I think this book has tended to exaggerate the importance of Jews per se as targets and that a comparison might be in order with other minorities.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Prager and Telushkin have some evidence to support each of their assertions and to rebut those who disagree.  For example, Jewish opposition to Fascism and to other tyrannies is a part of Jewish ethics and traditions.  This has made opposition to Jews from tyrants anything but accidental.  In any case, it is not mere semantics to say that antisemtism is primarily related to Judaism and Jewish life rather than being a specific case of a more general phenomenon that has little if anything to do with Jews at all.  The arguments in the book are careful and well reasoned.<br /><br />Prager and Telushkin supply five types of remedies to the problem of antisemitism.  One is assimilation, which might help some individual Jews but will not solve the problem for the antisemites or their remaining victims.  A second is Zionism, which provides a refuge, a homeland, and self-respect for Jews but once again does not solve the problem for the antisemites or for their new target of Israel.  A third is to seek plenty of converts, which, if successful, would indeed mollify the effects of antisemitism even if the many people remained antisemitic.  A fourth is to deal with the problem symptomatically, using force to suppress attacks on Jews.  Again, this could not be a long-term solution.  The fifth approach is to educate people in ethical behavior.  A population that values truth, justice, and human rights will be less susceptible to antisemitism.

The first third of the book covers Jerusalem up to the time of the Arab conquest in 637 AD.  The book continues to discuss Umayyad Jerusalem, Crusader Jerusalem (at some length), Jerusalem under the Ayyubids, Mamluks, Ottomans, and modern Jerusalem.  A team of ten scholars worked on this book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is a problem.  The final chapter, written by Michael Hudson, on modern Jerusalem, is like the thirteenth note of a cuckoo clock: not only is it manifestly wrong in itself, it also casts serious doubt on the preceding notes.<br /><br />At the start of the twentieth century, Jerusalem was a Jewish oasis in the Middle East.  Jews were a big majority in Jerusalem (about 64% of the city in 1910) and a small minority almost everywhere else in Asia.  During the past hundred years, much of Israel went from having an Arab majority to having a Jewish majority, but Jerusalem's demographics changed relatively little.  But to Hudson, there has been a tragic loss of the Arab character of the city.  The way he deplores the existence of anything Jewish about Jerusalem today sounds incredibly racist and reactionary.  More than that, it renders his chapter far less than objective.  This misleading chapter alone makes it impossible for me to recommend this book as a credible source.	2004-08-15

First, I must comment on the amazing number of \\"unhelpful\\" votes (often well over 100) for any favorable reviews of this book so far.  Such votes would have convinced me to find out more about this book had I not already read it.<br /><br />Well, what is the fuss all about?  Roughly speaking, antisemitism is hostility towards Jews and towards human rights for Jews.  The \\"new antisemitism\\" generally refers to implementing such hostility by attacking Israel from the political left (calling it racist, apartheid, colonial, oppressive, expansionist, reactionary, aggressive, tribal, irredentist, impudent, arrogant, and in need of punishment).  As Chesler explains, such attacks began in earnest after the 1967 six-day war.  Yes, Chesler herself noticed the extent of this trend only in 1980 and is writing about it only now.  But that is no crime.  Anyway, if the purpose of antizionism is simply to \\"ethnically cleanse\\" Israel of its Jews or to deny Israeli Jews basic human rights, it is indeed simply the old antisemitism with a new spin.<br /><br />One unusual comment by Chesler involves criticism of Israel.  While most people would call criticism of Zionism or Israel antisemitic only if it explicitly discriminated against, demonized or defamed Jews in general, Chesler also asks if there is anger and malice behind it.  Angry refusals to provide even the most limited opposition to attacks on Jewish rights are, in Chesler's opinion, a sign of antisemitism.<br /><br />Chesler exposes many lies of the new antisemitism and has some recommendations.  These include her belief that it is fundamental for us as humans to honor our dreams of peace.  To that end, she says we must fight Big Lies.  In addition, she thinks we must restore campus civility.  And she implores us to address the real problems of the world rather than avoid them by demonizing Israel instead.	2004-08-15

The truth is that Israelis are very productive and in peacetime would be a strong economic power without any help from anyone.  Cramer knows that the 3 billion dollars we give to Israel each year is peanuts.  That it is less than two per cent of their gross domestic product.  And that much of it is given in US-made arms, and is never seen as money at all.  And he knows that the money is far less than what we give to Western European nations, via NATO, or to Japan or Korea.  But he doesn't tell us that!<br /><br />Cramer tells us that Israel is important enough so that all it has to do is give away a little land and there will be peace in a major conflict!

Well, if that is true, Israel is indeed very wrong.  And if it is obviously true, then the Israelis, who aren't stupid, realize it as well.  And if they avoid making peace in spite of realizing this, it is clear that the only reason they could have for doing so is that they are so weird that they would prefer to be poor and dead than rich, alive, and at peace.  In spite of trying so hard to better their lives that they made the deserts bloom!<br /><br />So we can be sure Cramer is wrong.  And, of course, given his wrong answer, it isn't surprising that his facts are off as well.<br /><br />Israeli paranoia is not the \\"justification\\" for the existence of Israel any more than Czech paranoia is a \\"justification\\" for the Czech Republic or Thai paranoia for Thailand.  We know why Israel exists.  It's because Jews wanted to be there and paid high prices for land, and then found out explicitly in 1939, with the British White Paper, that the land would be stolen from them (and that their lives would be at grave risk) unless they had a nation that let them keep their property and admit immigrants.  So Cramer is wrong about why Israel exists.<br /><br />You might want to see what books Cramer lists as recommended in his acknowledgements.  There are a few by reasonable authors, such as by Michael Oren, Walter Laquer, Amos Elon, Zev Chafets, and Yigal Allon.

That is a big improvement over works that dryly list events without putting them in perspective or with works which are simply an unconvincing amalgam of anecdotes.<br /><br />One praiseworthy aspect of the book is the way it shows the difference between incidents for which many Israelis would apportion significant blame to both sides and incidents for which very few Israelis would do so.  An example of the former would be the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982.  An example of the latter would be the Arab war against Israel in 2000 accompanied by outright Arab rejection of Israeli peace overtures.  The book shows why the Arab initiation of this war, highlighted by a number of suicide bombings, is regarded as perfidious by most Israelis.	2004-08-14

I was hoping for something interesting.  After all, there was even a forward by none other than Kip Thorne!<br /><br />But this book was an awful disappointment.  First, Nahin did his readers no favor by utterly failing to understand the writings of Hospers.  On pages 289-290 and elsewhere, Nahin criticizes Hospers strongly, but Nahin is seriously in error.  For one thing, Nahin claims that Hospers says that one can not go back in time while Nahin says it is possible.  In fact, the reverse is true.  Hospers says that time travel is possible and Nahin actually is arguing against it.  To put it mildly, Nahin is an intellectual lightweight who has become totally confused by the plethora of time-travel paradoxes.<br /><br />Nahin is so sure that there is only one worldline and so sure that anyone who disagrees with him does not understand this that he simply refuses to read anything which hints at multiple world lines.  However, if he wants to disagree with those who discuss the concept of multiple world lines, he ought to read what they say first and even try to understand it!<br /><br />On top of this, I was amazed at the amount of material (some of it interesting and some of it nonsense) written about people travelling to the past, as opposed to people merely sending signals to the past.  A fundamental scenario would be to send a book to a time 50 years earlier, thereby \\"creating\\" information (the author, having already received the book, might no longer need to write it).  Or perhaps sending instructions to the past on how to build a camera, so that various famous historical events could be filmed and sent back to the \\"future.\\"  I think topics such as these would have merited some discussion.	2004-08-08

Eleven of his articles appear in this volume, which serves to give us all a wonderful taste of his scholarship.<br /><br />Many people have written about the role of the Great Powers in Arab history.  Karsh draws the line when Arabs are portrayed as hapless bystanders to their own history.  And these eleven articles all help point out where Arabs have made some serious missteps in the past century that they would be best not to blame others for.<br /><br />This book refutes claims that Arabs have never had anything against Jews or Judaism, only Zionists and Zionism.  It also points out that the trauma of the dispersion of many Levantine Arabs in 1948 was a largely self-inflicted phenomenon, not some long planned grand design by Zionists to deprive Arabs of their patrimony.<br /><br />History is not a free-for-all in which all statements are of equal value.  Truth helps one understand what is going on, it helps us infer details that we are not yet sure of, and it permits us to make intelligent predictions about the future.

But are these balanced by more reasonable presentations of reality?<br /><br /> Muravchik looks at ten different periods of time from the start of the latest intifada at the end of September, 2000 through the battle for Jenin in April, 2002. And while he finds some consistently biased reporting by some individuals at CNN, CBS, NBC, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, only ABC had a consistent overall bias without any balance from less tenditious individuals. This was presumably due to the power of Peter Jennings in determining what ABC would report.<br /><br /> Muravchik does a superb job of spotting inconsistencies in stories and illogical jumps from a set of facts to unwarranted conclusions. He points out serious omissions of facts that could be expected to give viewers and readers very distorted views of each topic. And he shows how three major factors have worked to make Israel look bad. First, Arab spokesmen, even many of the &quot;people on the street,&quot; have shown a remarkable capacity for telling lies, far more so than Israeli ones. Second, the Arab press is not a free one at all, and simply says what it is told to say. Third, Arab thugs menace reporters who portray them in less than a flattering light; those reporters who cooperate with the Arabs are given scoops and interviews. These asymmetries make it easier for authoritarian regimes to pervert the profession of journalism and to twist it to serve their purposes.	2004-08-03

Every time Israel defends itself against attack, there are claims, justified or not, that Israelis have stepped over the line.<br /><br />Sometimes, this strategy seems to work, as Israelis start to ask themselves what went wrong.  They ask if there was a way to use less force and put fewer civilian lives at stake.  And some of them help give the impression that Israel is doing something inherently wrong by defending itself at all.<br /><br />Anyway, this time, the doves in Israel won out, and Jenin was handled in a truly heroic and humane fashion.  That made no difference to many antizionists, who automatically told the same lies, such as the ones in this book.  But it made a big difference to the Israelis, the vast majority of whom are very proud of Israeli behavior in Jenin and see the lies about Jenin as far worse than those about many other battles.<br /><br />The battle for Jenin was a test for antizionist writers.  And many of them flunked it.  This book is a good example of that.	2004-08-03

Much of the material that has been produced has paid more attention to political correctness than historical accuracy.<br /><br /> I am glad to say that this book is a serious and scholarly work.<br /><br /> The book starts by explaining the extent to which the Jews of the early nineteenth century had spent centuries as non-belligerents and pacifists. This was due in part to an aversion of war and to an even greater extent on the fact that the Jews were a defeated people who were not permitted to hold weapons. The book then examines how such a humiliated people finally acquired the willingness, ability, and nerve to defend itself and finally even attack its enemies.<br /><br /> Shapira starts with the development of a &quot;defensive ethos&quot; in the Levant, from 1881 to 1921. The next segment of the book tells of the defensive ethos at work from 1921 to 1936. The remainder tells of the trials of the Jews in the Levant from 1936 to 1947 that led at first to use of force by irregulars and finally to military offenses approved of by the representatives of the population at large.<br /><br /> As Shapira explains, at first, this use of force against the Arab pogroms of 1936 was confined to the Irgun, which represented a small minority of the Jews of the Levant, and an even smaller splinter group from the Irgun, namely the Stern Gang. The majority had a policy of &quot;self-restraint.&quot; This continued even after the perfidious British White Paper of 1939 shifted the Jewish population to almost total insistence on the establishment of a Jewish state in the region. However, after World War 2, when British policy became even more unbalanced in favor of Arab aggression, the majority started to approve of counterattacks, starting in October, 1945. While the counterattacks by the majority ended in 1946, the stage had been set for military action. In April, 1948, that action was taken, and what became the Israeli army the following month went into action to actively relieve the siege of Jerusalem. As Shapira points out in her introduction, in 1982 Israeli forces even went into action in Lebanon as a matter of &quot;choice.&quot; For the first time in many, many centuries, Jews had fought an offensive military action as Jews without believing that they needed to do so at once simply to survive. The transition from a humiliated people that neither was able to fight nor wished to do so to one that was willing and able to fight was finally accomplished.<br /><br /> One interesting point that Shapira makes has to do with the Shoah or Holocaust. The slaughter of millions of European Jews was a disaster for the Jews of the Levant. It was also an embarrassment that so many Jews appeared to go to their deaths &quot;as sheep to the slaughter.&quot; Shapira discusses the effect of having the Jews appear so weak and hapless on this occasion, and how this helped to catalyze the transition of the Jews to a people that were willing to fight. But Shapira shows that the establishment of Israel was not a direct result of the Holocaust. &quot;It is possible to imagine,&quot; says Shapira, &quot;that if the Holocaust had not occurred, the pressure of many more millions of living Jews would not have been inferior to the moral weight of the martyred dead.&quot;pril, 1948, that action was taken, and what became the Israeli army the following month went into action to actively relieve the siege of Jerusalem.

Dershowitz lists a number of these untruths and refutes them.<br /><br />Dershowitz is careful to quote the sources of these untruths.  That's an excellent idea.  It shows that he is not dealing with straw-men.  And it exposes as untrustworthy a number of well-known people who have commented on the Arab-Israeli dispute, including Ed Said, Noam Chomsky, Norman G. Finkelstein, Azmi Bishara, Ilan Pappe, Bob Novak, Francis Boyle, Christopher Hitchens and Desmond Tutu.<br /><br />The book mentions the support antizionist Arabs gave to the Nazis in World War 2, refuting claims that all Arabs were innocent victims in that war.  It points out that if Arab aggressors get whatever they want in their war against Israel, it will only be a matter of time before other nations choose terrorism as their first option.  It shows the similarities between the Arab terrorists who kill Jews today and the Ku Klux Klan terrorists who killed Blacks a century ago.  And it also notes that while films glorifying the Ku Klux Klan are not shown on college campuses today, films glorifying the Arab terrorists are.<br /><br />Still, there is something inherently sad about having to defend an accused nation against such absurd lies at all.  Why should a small nation such as Israel need to be defended?  Israel isn't a big problem, right or wrong.  Those who are obsessed with it are the problem.  Had much of the world not been so intent on jumping into the fray, on the side of the terrorists no less, there would not be much of an issue.	2004-08-03

However, this silly and absurd book doesn't even do that.  It has nothing to offer anyone.<br /><br />I didn't have any preconceived demands on this book.  I didn't need it to say something like:<br /><br />... We Women hold up our half of the sky.  And more.  But in monotheistic society, we've been doing two thirds of the work.  And having only one third of the fun.  Moreover, this unnatural, patriarchal monotheism has made tyrannical religious demands upon us.  That's not how we lived in the past.  We can and should return to Paganism and a more natural and cooperative society which cherishes and values everyone. ...<br /><br />Of course, had it said that and defended it with a modicum of clarity, I'd have applauded it and given it five stars.  But suppose it had merely looked at the overall problem of the role of Women in human society.  Something like:<br /><br />... There are differences between the roles of Women and Men.  The Women bear the children.  The Women nurse the children.  While both Women and Men have a big role in raising children, these roles are not exactly the same.  In addition, the Men are generally stronger than the Women.  One major societal problem is that Women tend to work harder to help their own children than they do to help the children of others.  And Men tend to work harder to help their children than they do to help the children of others.  But Women generally know which children are theirs while Men aren't always so sure.  Here's how some societies have dealt with these issues, and how a few societies, including our own, have gone astray.  And here is how we can make things better.  ...<br /><br />Well, that would have been okay too.  And it would have been heading for five stars as well.<br /><br />But this book didn't do anything of the sort.  Instead, it simply wandered all over the map.  There were plenty of factually dubious statements and poor logic that obliterated any possible flow of argument.

The slaughter of millions of Jews by the Nazis in World War 2 was especially atrocious. It was marked by several unusual features including large-scale long-standing discrimination and incitement, widespread propaganda, and a very highly organized extermination industry the likes of which had never been seen before. It took place in an era where the entire world had a chance to participate in giving potential victims a place of refuge. That is sufficient reason for anyone to reflect on its significance.<br /><br />  This book could have seriously discussed false conclusions that some people have tried to draw from the history of Jewish suffering. Instead, it viciously slams those who wish to memorialize the dead, claim reparations for stolen property, teach about the catastrophe as a means to avoid repeating it, or defend Jewish rights in Israel. These attacks are unnecessary, misleading, and invalid. On top of that, they serve to support those who oppose human rights today.	2004-08-01

We're not seeing a mass exodus or extermination of Arabs.  I can only wonder why Hoffman did not choose to bemoan the fate of the Germans in World War 2: surely the huge number of German deaths would to him have been proof of a Jewish genocide of the Nazis, rather than the contrary.<br /><br />When Jewish populations in the Levant began to increase in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries due to the success of modern Zionism, Arabs tended to move to regions of high Jewish population.  And Arab populations have tended to increase in those areas since then.  This is at odds with a hypothesis that Arabs are being strongly oppressed there!  Truly oppressed people would try to avoid that region or even flee it.<br /><br />In summary, this book has little to do with logic or facts.  It seems that the author had a different agenda in mind, namely a malicious attack on the Jews of Israel.	2004-07-25
