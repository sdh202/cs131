At times it's darkly humorous and at other times beautiful or grotesque. As historical fiction, it succeeds in taking no account at all of modern beliefs or politics (thankfully). At the same time, it can be interpreted as an indictment of the \\"modern civilization\\" that was to come -- where everything becomes the Trade. <br /> <br />I think this is a great novel that has somehow slipped into the world without much fanfare. I highly recommend it.	2005-09-16

The stories that I thought were the strongest were by Gregory Maguire, Margo Lanagan, Stepan Chapman, Tanith Lee, Catherynne M. Valente, Conrad Williams and Elizabeth A. Lynn, with a particular mention for Laird Barron's creepy, poetic western \\"Bulldozer\\". The mix of new and established writers, visible in that list, adds interest. As in the past, the stories tend toward urban/modern-day settings, but a few do represent the historical and otherworld facets of the genre. <br /> <br />If any story in the anthology is controversial, it'll be the Chuck Palahniuk. I didn't like it -- I thought it read sort of like a grade schooler's gross-out combined with a careful reading of the Anatomy and Physiology Coloring Book -- but on the other hand, it does take something really gross to gross me out these days. And gross me out it did. Recommended for strong stomachs (heh) only. <br /> <br />On page 466 my story \\"The Elf Knight and Lady Isabelle\\" from the anthology CLOAKED IN SHADOW got an honorable mention.  <br /> <br />	2005-09-14

Some of the plot elements -- Violet's experiences and the long-lost sister -- are well-worn, but the manner of telling is so fresh that it doesn't really matter. \\"Mrs. Fox\\", unrepentantly awful and cheerfully unsinkable, is a gem. <br /> <br />I think some readers will have trouble following the plotline, especially in the beginning, and the quick-spoken, intricate period diction, particularly in Mrs. Fox's voice, may lose some, but the book rewards close attention. It would appeal to readers who enjoyed books like SLAMMERKIN and THE DRESS LODGER, but its tone is far more arch. <br /> <br />Recommended.	2005-08-22

Deeply problematic in its historical research -- quoting at length from reputable but old secondary sources and at even greater length from totally unknown secondary sources; making no apparent use of primary documents at all. This sort of 'research' may be responsible for the repetition in the text of many problematic anecdotes. Unorthodox in its use of punctuation and spelling -- Stuart's response to being called 'The Plumbed (sic.) Knight' not once but thrice can only be imagined, and various grammatical errors make their way even into quoted material. Limited at best in its evocation and analysis of the battle that is the book's subject. Strange in several of its assumptions -- that the Confederates who briefly broke through the Union line on Cemetery Ridge on July 3 spent \\"twenty minutes\\" just sort of looking around and waiting for reinforcements; that Ewell could have easily taken Culp's Hill on the 2nd; that 'Pickett's Charge' should have been followed immediately, over the same ground, by a shoulder-to-shoulder cavalry charge by Stuart's troopers. (After they trampled Pickett's men, their next move was to be...?)     Readers interested in this subject are encouraged to look at Longacre's THE CAVALRY AT GETTYSBURG.	2005-06-17

I found Nolan's article on Lee's leadership particularly useful in its examination of the cavalry's role and of Lee's actions in general, although I'm not as convinced as Nolan that going into Pennsylvania in the first place was a bad idea. Krick's analysis of the appalling incompetence of two Confederate brigadiers is both horrifying and hilarious -- his vivid writing creates clear images of egregious individuals who sound like characters in a movie, except that unfortunately they were real.    I felt that all of the essays contained strong scholarship that supported its arguments with evidence from primary sources such as the OR, diaries, official communications and personal letters, treating memoirs with caution while not avoiding them absolutely. This is what one would expect in a book of this kind and to my observation it was not lacking here. Nolan's analysis of Lee's orders to Stuart, in which he categorically lists four ways in which the text of these orders offered insufficient direction, is one example of the clear and incisive work to be found here.    A little limited in its contents -- based on the publication date I wonder if this was one of Gallagher's first collections -- but definitely a useful text.	2005-05-26

Taylor's work does not exude the winning personality of a Porter Alexander or a Sam Watkins. Especially as Taylor paid considerable attention to the numerical strengths of the respective armies, this is an important primary source, but it's hard to imagine it capturing nonspecialist readers' attention. <br /> <br />Taylor owed his career to Lee both before and after the war and clearly felt an admiration amounting to worship for his chief; like all personal accounts, this one should be read with the author's perspectives and biases in mind. <br /> <br />	2005-05-11

I don't understand why so little historical fiction takes the English Civil War and its lengthy and dramatic aftermath as a setting. Whatever the reason, its rarity makes The King's Touch a particularly welcome book. While a bit more grasp of the period's ideologies and material culture would have been an improvement, in general I thought the Restoration was effectively evoked.    Told primarily in first person from the point of view of Jemmy, Charles II's illegitimate son who becomes Duke of Monmouth, the narrative focuses heavily on Jemmy's childhood, his upbringing and his relationships with others, particularly his elusive father. Morgan effectively portrays human, flawed yet deeply sympathetic characters who have been damaged by disinheritance, exile and uncertainty, without sliding (much) into anachronism. Solely a book about human relationships, King's Touch contains little physical action; a different author might have chosen to portray Jemmy in battle rather than skimming over military events. However, the plot held my interest.    I think this would have a broad appeal to readers of romantic historical fiction (as opposed to 'historical' romance novels).	2005-05-09

Williams can definitely ring the changes on one type of story effectively, but it would be interesting to see if he can do other things as well.  <br /> <br />Toward the end of the collection a couple of New Weird-ish, alternate apocalyptic stories add interest. <br /> <br />This might appeal to readers who like Kathe Koja's earlier work, for example EXTREMITIES.	2005-05-09

Lee and Civil War History (Civil War America)	Books	4	18	25	N	N	Lee Considered	Nolan analyzes the difference between Robert E. Lee as a historical person and as a semi-mythical icon.    I found the scholarship here pleasantly rational, and I particularly liked Nolan's portrayal of Lee as a product of his time. His purpose is not to \\"deconstruct\\" Lee or offer a \\"revisionist\\" history, but to correct long-accepted material that makes claims that contradict the evidence of primary sources such as Lee's own letters. Nolan consistently uses primary sources and considers nineteenth-century mentalities in making his arguments.     At times his analysis is brief, and in particular the chapter on grand strategy could have been longer and more detailed and taken into consideration more of the factors affecting Lee's actions, such as the proximity to the border of places like Richmond and the Shenandoah Valley that had to be defended. At times, he seems to ascribe Lee an overexaggerated amount of power over the hearts, minds and actions of the soldiers of the Army of Northern Virginia. It does not seem reasonable to suggest that Lee should have sought a surrender after Gettysburg (which most scholars now agree was not seen at the time as a 'turning point', and perhaps should not be seen that way today either) and it seems unlikely to me that anyone would have gone along with him if he had.    Nolan states his intention not to analyze or criticize Lee's smaller-scale decisions, so I can't knock him for keeping his word, but some analysis of Lee's relations with his subordinates might have been useful here. In particular, it would have been interesting to know to what extent Lee participated, post-war, in the making of his own myth.     Nolan's analyses of the Confederacy as a whole sometimes seem a bit broad and sweeping. I don't think that he's on particularly firm ground with his implicit claim that Confederate depredations in the North were somehow equivalent to Federal actions against civilian property in the South, and his insistence on the centralityof slavery to the Confederate cause, while probably not incorrect per se, leaves aside contemporary evidence on what actuated soldiers in the field to fight (such as the letters and diaries studied by James McPherson). It also ignores the vast regional and cultural variation across the Confederacy; slavery was not of enormous importance in some regions which nevertheless were strongly secessionist in their sympathies.    On the other hand, his discussion of postwar North-South confabulation and the North's limited commitment to the welfare of African Americans is well taken.    Overall, though, I felt this was a strong analysis containing intelligent scholarship. It remains difficult to offer any criticism of Robert E. Lee, even if the criticism amounts only to saying that he was a fallible human being and a product of his time, without experiencing violent opposition. I think that Nolan's work is a worthwhile addition to Civil War scholarship.	2005-04-29

It clearly has served as a major source for generations of scholars; it describes most of the ANV's actions with a fair amount of detail and also discusses Lee's early campaign in West Virginia. The numerical strengths of the armies are tabulated in detail. <br /> <br />Taylor's hero-worship of Lee is clear in his analyses of events and in the appended anniversary address, which doesn't make this a less useful source but should be taken into account.	2005-04-18

This is a scorchingly angry book and one with a lot of truth to it, so that even though the world depicted is so totally dystopian its features can be seen within our own -- in particular the ideology of profit. Morgan's writing also rings absolutely true in his depiction of Chris and Carla's relationship and its disintegration.    The book is far, in my opinion, from being just an anti-whateverist screed -- it's a study of a character under pressure, and its being at times ugly doesn't detract from its power. In fact, I think this is the strongest of Morgan's books yet -- the unity of theme and the skilled handling of the plot in particular show improvement over his other two novels that have been published so far in the U.S., although I thought those were excellent as well.    It's a serious book and it's not a happy one, but it does also have some just plain awesome-cool action scenes, fond thoughts of which have kept me entertained during my Highway 17 commute for a couple of days now.	2005-04-15

It is interesting as an account of Longstreet and others around him, although it shouldn't be taken as absolute gospel; Sorrel's opinion on the Gettysburg campaign in particular seems calculated to deflect any possible criticism from his erstwhile chief. <br /> <br />There are some interesting and unexpected tidbits here -- for one, the role of the spy Harrison, whose very existence has been questioned by some writers. Far from appearing only once on the eve of Gettysburg, he appears in Sorrel's memoir as a regular contact of Longstreet's and one who was still living when the memoir was written. This would seem to strengthen the argument that Harrison's information about Federal activities in the Gettysburg campaign would have been useful to the Confederate command. <br /> <br />It's also interesting (and refreshing) to see how non-teetotal Sorrel's Army of Northern Virginia is -- whiskey everywhere, and even a priceless scene of Longstreet and other officers singing arias while standing on a table.	2005-04-13

I can't understand why this series wouldn't get more support, because in my opinion it has everything that successful science fiction needs. Watts incorporates big, shiny ideas -- and the deep-sea biology is a wonderful original touch. The books include a high level of action and tension and, pleasantly unusually for \\"idea\\" SF, are strongly character-driven. And the characters are tormented enough for anyone. <br /> <br />There are flaws. At times, the plot is unclear, and while I like the pivotal role played by ignorance and misunderstanding, at times an irritating back-and-forth plot dynamic (Seppuku is a cure, no it isn't, yes it is) appears. Characterization, while overall excellent, at times seems over the top -- it's not entirely clear why *everyone* is so messed up, and the stupid bickering between the Rifters and the corporates in Atlantis left me with sympathy for neither side. I was put off by the apparent indifference of the characters to the impending destruction of Earth's whole ecosystem -- but then, they're selfish and profoundly damaged people, and creating sympathy for them in the reader's mind does not seem to have been Watts' priority. I would have found the aforesaid destruction more effective had it been shown more clearly. <br /> <br />But, despite all these quibbles, I think this series is really good SF, and I highly recommend it.	2005-04-08

(Joe Wheeler's opinion, if available, would have been interesting; as would that of, say, Frederick Douglass.) As it stands, this volume gives a limited perspective. It is interesting to note that both the memoirs by Forrest's troopers  make no denial of a \\"massacre\\" at Fort Pillow, mention a belief that the defending troops were drunk, and cite the presence of white East Tennessee Unionists as an inflammatory factor -- statements that are taken into little account in the few modern scholarly examinations of Fort Pillow I've run across.	2005-03-29

Ford's alternative history concepts are fascinating. At times, his writing is beautiful and many of the individual scenes are full of action and imagery.     However, the book reads to me like something the author wrote for himself, without considering (or perhaps without caring) if readers could follow along. Characters' motivations are opaque, as are some of the events in the plot; a major antagonist only comes into existence near the end of the book and is never developed. Whole scenes descend into a kind of oblique vagueness; characters react, sometimes with great emotional intensity, but it is not always clear to the reader what caused the reaction. That Dragon Waiting held my interest despite this is a tribute to Ford's writing, but it's hard not to think that a tremendous story was lost in the shadows of this book.	2005-03-21

At times, Glatthaar makes inexplicable comments like \\"Most Confederates were a propertied class (Glatthaar, 226)\\" that seem, if not outright incorrect, at least oversimplified. <br /> <br />Readers who enjoy the \\"great man\\" approach to history may well find this book a pleasant read.	2005-03-20

Lee's heroic image was largely created post-war by a small group of Virginians, and goes on to give what he regards as a more accurate assessment. <br /> <br />While agreeing that the post-war canonization of Lee imposed some distortions upon historians which modern scholars do well to avoid, several things about this study didn't convince me. Firstly, Connelly spends little time analyzing Lee's popularity during the war, which rose after the Peninsula campaign and remained high through the end; Lee and his army were a significant image and source of morale to all Southerners, not just Virginians, at that time. <br /> <br />Secondly, Connelly makes various statements about personalities and psychological quirks -- Mary Custis Lee was \\"unpleasant\\", Lee was morbid and death-obsessed -- in the presence of limited supporting evidence and of no discussion of the mentalities, religious faith, and social norms of the time. (His idiosyncratic assessment of individuals includes a characterization of Fitz Lee as the worst of Lee's cavalry commanders -- even considering the shadbake incident, that seems like too strong a statement when one considers that Fitz' competition for the worst would include candidates such as Grumble Jones and the luckless Lunsford Lomax.)  <br /> <br />This study does reveal the ugly post-war squabble for the portrayal of history in all its inglory.	2005-03-14

I found his comments on Ken Burns' The Civil War and on the preservation of battlefields to be interesting, pertinent and something a bit different from the usual historical paper. Other articles here examine Lee and the ideology of the Lost Cause, Confederate leadership at Gettysburg (about which I am in entire agreement with Gallagher's conclusions except that I would be less generous to Hill), the 1862 and 1864 Valley campaigns, and other, often controversial, topics.	2005-03-13

Most editions have footnotes and extensive commentary by Frederick Maurice. <br /> <br />Marshall seems to have been Lee's greatest fan, defending him at all points, claiming to know his mind (even when, as in the instance of Lee's intention to fight a battle during the Gettysburg campaign, other evidence suggests Marshall is mistaken) and fervently exonerating him of all wrong. Little personal reminiscence is here except for concerning Appomattox, although Marshall does vouchsafe the information that the first time he ever heard musket fire was during the battles of the Seven Days and he didn't know at first what he was hearing. <br /> <br />Marshall's memoir is of interest for scholars of Lee and also for those interested in the role of the cavalry during the Gettysburg campaign, because Marshall is one of the major voices to speak up blaming Stuart. I found it interesting to note that Marshall implies the famous confusing order which states \\"If General Hooker's army remains inactive...but should he not appear to be moving northward\\" was meant to be worded that way; Marshall goes on to refer to it in the same terms, suggesting there was no error, and also claims that Lee was concerned Hooker might move southward to threaten Richmond. In any case, one may (and probably should) disagree with some of what Marshall has to say but this is an important memoir nonetheless.	2005-03-06

I found the politics in this book extremely complex and hard to follow, despite having some knowledge of the time period, and that combined with periodic lulls in the plot meant the book took me over a month to finish, when I normally read a book in a few days. Several of the plot sequences, such as that with Thorfinn (Macbeth)'s lover and rival Rognvald, and the penultimate battle for Alba, are active, intense and moving, but long stretches of not-so-gripping material divide them. Some of the characters, such as Thorfinn, his wife Groa and Rognvald, are brilliantly drawn, but others, such as the legion of clerics, are too numerous for this reader, at least, to relate to. Here and there, characteristically for Dunnett, moments of humor enliven the text. <br /> <br />I liked the book very much but I found it perhaps more difficult than it had to be.	2005-03-06

I suspect not all viewers/readers would feel the same. <br /> <br />I thought CD was an intelligent and interesting book, a bit awkwardly phrased at times as I find literature in translation tends to be, though there were also some nice images. I would have liked it to be a bit more emotionally involving. It would appeal, I think, to people who like Dunning's book-trade mysteries, and who read Dumas, and there's also a sideways connection to Mary Gentle's excellent novel 1610: A Sundial In A Grave. I liked CD enough to seek out the author's other work.	2005-02-24
340895:US	51145127	R6J3BVI1XBT3T	0553803018	613675906	The Emancipator's Wife: A Novel of Mary Todd Lincoln	Books	3	27	34	N	N	The Emancipator's Wife	Probably a 3+ or 4-, really.    A character study and fictionalized biography of Mary Todd Lincoln, President Lincoln's wife.    Hambly gives a sympathetic analysis of Mary Lincoln's character, putting her well within historical context while portraying some of her troubles -- overspending, for example -- in terms many modern readers will personally relate to. The story's pacing moves well when it covers Mary's girlhood and her early courtship with Lincoln, and it rises to a peak of tension when she is committed to an insane asylum; at other times, due to Hambly's apparent determination to cover every event in Mary's life over many years, the tension drops and the story drags, at least for me. The story is entirely from Mary's point of view with the exception of brief segments from other perspectives which may not have been entirely necessary. Certainly, the worldview and political views expressed seem to be Mary's.    And because of that, though this novel is in large part a love story, it does not analyze Mr. Lincoln's character to any great extent. It has almost nothing to say about his political decisions and is uncritically orthodox in its view of him as good-hearted abolitionist. Lincoln here is an appealing character, but not necessarily a sterling work of accurate historical reconstruction.     Nor is the novel a Civil War story; most of the action takes place before the war and in 1875, and though of course the war is covered it is nearly all offscreen.    Although I think this book has considerable depth and subtlety and is at times quite moving, I'm not sure to whom it will appeal. Readers of Hambly's top-notch fantasy and historical mysteries may find this has not enough action for them - as may readers of Civil War novels and historical fiction in general. It may appeal to readers of historical fiction writers like Vidal and Doctorow; people who like the fictionalized biographies of famous women by authors such as Antonia Fraser may also enjoy this.	2005-02-22

To me, the strong similarities to Tolkien, particularly the similarity to the mythic part of the SILMARILLION, and the overall familiar multi-species fantasy setting work well here -- because I think that without the familiar setting, the turnaround that Carey is doing would be lost on many readers. She's writing here from the point of view of the \\"dark\\" side, throwing down a gauntlet of challenge to the good-versus-evil oversimplification that has become the fantasy standard. Some neat worldbuilding elements, like an immortal wound eternally bleeding ichor and the world seen fragmented and flying through ravens' eyes, do sneak in as well. <br /> <br />As well as being thematically interesting, BANEWREAKER is a good story. I found myself drawn in to the characters and their plight. The book avoids generalizations -- it's not just \\"the bad guys are good guys\\", it's \\"there are no easy choices,\\" and for me that helped keep things interesting. The writing is workmanlike rather than artistic and the characterization fairly broad, but it kept me interested and engaged. I look forward to the sequels.	2005-02-14

Bonny is a changeling, perhaps partially the offspring of a black tomcat; her caul will protect her from drowning; wise women foretell the future in mystic terms. The novel is also well characterized, with secondary characters such as Jack Rackham and Mary Read sympathetic and engaging. A certain lack of detailed action scenes (considering this is a pirate novel) is partly made up for by strong dialogue and touches of both humor and sensuality. Although in the final analysis the themes of selfhood and relationships with parents get a little muddled and a little sentimental, this is well worth reading.	2005-02-07

This study has some interesting points to make, particularly that under some circumstances attacks, including sabre charges, were highly successful -- an argument that goes against the oversimplified idea that Civil War defenders always got the upper hand. Nosworthy seems to emphasize Union sources, especially in his discussion of cavalry attacks which cites no Confederate successes at all, but uses some Confederate accounts as well throughout the text. At times he seems a bit trusting of single primary sources, particularly memoirs, but overall the use of sources and the arguments are convincing. Another intriguing discussion centers on the massive amount of lead that had to be fired to cause a casualty, and the reasons why that was the case.    The book does rather little to address soldier mentalities and the physical experience of battle -- some material is discussed but not as much as expected. I was also disappointed with its lack of discussion of any intelligence-gathering activity -- particularly when analyzing the cavalry, it seems strange to leave out scouting and the screening of army movements, as well as raiding. Perhaps Nosworthy felt these activities were beyond his battlefield-centered scope.    Overall, this was a useful and pleasantly un-positivist study. It might have benefited from clearer organization and maybe some editing of its considerable length.	2005-02-06

Timothy narrates this beautifully written book, which is not only a 19th-century thriller that will please readers who liked books such as FIEND IN HUMAN and THE ALIENIST, but is also a meditation on personality, maturation and loss. Timothy sees the ghost of his father wherever he goes, and must eventually come to terms with not only his father's death but his own adolescent behavior and the stresses that Scrooge's generosity put on his family. (Scrooge, though appearing, is never named in the text.) At times the narration slips into sentimentality, particularly when dealing with the father theme. Counteracting this, though, are moments of sensuality and some sensational action, especially a fight on the roof of a racing hansom cab.    One thing Bayard does particularly well here is to evoke a vivid, sympathetic character in first person. Timothy's personality clearly has aspects beyond what this text chooses to explore, and though this isn't the kind of book that normally has a sequel, I'd be glad to read one.    The language does occasionally slip into anachronism, but I found the errors trivial.    Definitely recommended.	2005-02-06

Merula, the African shamaness, is portrayed skillfully, as a real person rather than a stereotype. Elizabeth, as in the earlier books, is a both powerful and human figure. <br /> <br />My favorite part of this book was the dream sequences, alternative-history bits in which the Armada actually lands; but I really wanted one more sequence, one offering resolution for Becket, who is seen at a very important moment only through Merula's point of view. I wasn't crazy about the repetition of events in different POVs; usually Finney had shown the character's reactions already from another character's point of view so that the repetition really wasn't needed. In general, though, I felt the plot was fast-moving, plausible and gripping. <br /> <br />Finney's work in general and this book in particular should appeal to readers who enjoy the work of Mary Gentle and Dorothy Dunnett.	2005-02-03

I would think this book would appeal to people who enjoyed Frank Herbert's books, as it uses some similar tropes -- Mentat-like trances, reading of gesture and expression, an overall philosophical bent -- and at times reads Herbert-like, particularly in its use of internalized thoughts. With its broad, epic sweep and large cast of characters sometimes engaged in huge battles, it may well also appeal to Erikson fans, and perhaps to people who liked Glen Cook's Black Company books.    Personally, I didn't find that WARRIOR PROPHET worked for me. The characters did not capture my interest, the all-too-infrequent action scenes left me cold since I wasn't engaged with the characters, the setting seemed underwritten despite the book's overall length, and I felt like the general tone was too macho and too would-be intellectual without ever quite saying anything of philosophical substance. I just didn't find a lot here that was either immersive or emotionally engaging for me, which is what I look for in fiction. I would characterize WARRIOR PROPHET as not at all to my personal taste, which is more for character-driven, intimate, highly detailed work.    Both this and the prequel are beautiful physical artifacts, with an unusual quality of design that is a real pleasure to see and that very much outshines most of the other books on the shelves.	2005-02-03

Readers who dislike sentiment and who get bored with long expository passages won't find this is their favorite book. Even I, who love melodrama, found myself tempted at some points during CHECKMATE to shake the characters violently and yell, \\"Get over it!\\" <br /> <br />But it's gorgeous stuff nonetheless. Dunnett's whole six-book series is the story of one outstanding character, only rarely told from his point of view, and aided by a vivid supporting cast. She spares him few agonies (even if at times one feels he overreacts just a tad) and gives him great beauty and great talents. Writing in impeccable omniscient point of view, she captures the 1500's beautifully with only a tiny hint of an anachronism here and there. I recommend these books to readers who enjoy character-driven historical fiction with considerable action as well as considerable emotion.	2005-01-25

Smith has a perfect eye for the telling detail, the understated comment. The novel's dark, ironic, threatening mood, with its flashes of light in which human interaction defies death, never falters. <br /> <br />At times, the plot meanders, and here and there it drops a beat. However, the story's other good qualities make up for that. In particular, the \\"villain\\", despite committing the heinous crime of a long dialogue infodump explaining what he did and how and why, after which he of course intends to shoot the progagonist, is interesting because to many readers, including myself, his motivations won't seem villainous at all. For the most part, this novel avoids the obvious and demonstrates a mastery of brutally effective understatement. <br /> <br />	2005-01-22

I was hoping the book would help me build the mentality of a character who lives in 1876 Galveston, but in vain. Perhaps it is not possible to get such a clear picture from the available evidence. <br /> <br />It may also be worth pointing out that the sources used by Robb are heavily weighted toward the end of the 19th century, the turn of the century and the early 20th century, and tend to focus on Europe. <br /> <br />Having said that the book didn't give me what I was hoping for, I still found it interesting and worth reading. Robb adequately proves his main thesis, which is that a significant body of thought portraying same-sex relations as healthy, normal and praiseworthy was available to at least some individuals in the late 19th century.	2005-01-21

For me, though, in the end there's not enough story here to make the book memorable.    All the events affecting the characters and the little mining town in which they live are disastrous, to the point of caricature, and none of them seem to be brought about by protagonist choices or actions; even the vividly described death of a boy in a mine and an accidental pregnancy seem like the results of some looming, inexplicably malevolent Fate. The narrative style in which the story is told by the main character late in life ensures that we know he survives. The beauty of the sentence-level style masks the problems with the plot to some extent but doesn't, in the end, conceal its general pointlessness.	2005-01-21

While listening to the Steeleye Span rendition of the ballad in my car, I had a sudden inspiration: \\"I know why he kills them!\\" I shouted, slamming on the brakes.

By knowing what she's talking about, by adding a wealth of worldbuilding detail and by adding interesting original touches in the form of herblore and religion, Micklem writes about knights in armor and still makes her story seem fresh and interesting. Deft sentence-level writing helps keep the narrative engaging. <br /> <br />This character-driven story focuses on the relationship between the strong-willed herbalist Firethorn and the impetuous young knight Galan, but should not be avoided by those who normally avoid \\"romance\\"; it is an intelligent story with plenty of action. Not all the secondary characters are equally well drawn and the brutish nature of most of them gets wearying at times, but overall this is a very impressive first novel.	2004-10-21

The plots are fast-moving with plenty of action and tension, and the characters are vividly drawn and interesting. <br /> <br />In this particular book, I thought there was slightly less detail and drama than in some of the earlier ones. My suspension of disbelief was a bit strained by the introduction of Jefferson Davis as a character, and I thought Hannibal's rather pathetic naivete in the duel clashed with his personality as I interpreted it in earlier books. I also missed Shaw (I really want a novel just about him. Sigh.) <br /> <br />However, Dead Water is still a book well worth reading and I recommend it.	2004-10-13

While this first novel has some original touches and nicely avoids good-versus-evil cliches, it doesn't really stand out to me. The worldbuilding is that of generic epic fantasy, with civilizations lasting thousands of years, emperors, dark lords, and multiple species; some distinctly Frank Herbert-esque touches of religious cults, killing words and Mentat-like trances add interest, but are not really well developed. (I do think the Sranc, murderous creatures perhaps best described as goblin-elves, are interesting.) Rapid POV switches between characters who are broadly sketched rather than vividly developed makes the plot not so much hard to follow as hard to maintain interest in. <br />Sentence-level writing is sparse, at times to the point of dullness; there is an overall lack of imagery, and though I applaud the author's desire to avoid infodumps I think readers may find the setting generally underdeveloped. While reading, I never felt drawn into the world; not only visual but sensory detail is largely lacking from what feel like rapidly sketched scenes. <br />The work shows potential, but not brilliance, in my opinion.<br />This will probably appeal to fans of epic fantasy; I don't think it transcends the genre.	2004-06-21

Low Red Moon stands alone; you don't have to have read Threshold to understand it.<br />It's interesting to watch an author learn and develop skills. Kiernan's writing has improved dramatically since her first published novel, Silk; there are still shiny stylistic twists, but there's also a solid, high-tension plot (better paced than Threshold) and well-realized, believable characters. <br />Many things are well done here: the sentence-level writing, the way the dark secrets hidden at the book's center are revealed just enough to make sense, but not enough to lose their effect. Narcissa, the &quot;villain&quot;, is a complex character in her own right. The story's resolution will not please readers who want happy endings, but I liked it.<br />I wanted more of the paleontology, wanted it worked into the story (which it is in Threshold more than in this book) rather than just being a character trait - it's interesting, original and has lots of horror potential.<br />It's really good to know that someone is writing intelligent, stylish New Horror.

But if that's the case, some events are certainly left unexplained.<br />The sentence-level writing is painfully clunky at times, and overall the 20th century plot is better developed and more believable than the 17th, which doesn't seem to me to capture the necessary magic. Kerr skillfully portrays the tragedy of the early days of the AIDS epidemic. In general her characterization is competent.<br />In the first part of the book I was thinking \\"this would be great for teaching young adults about tolerance, but the universe is so benevolent it's not even believable.\\" Obviously, it doesn't stay that way. In fact, the end of the 20th century plotline is so tragic that it has stayed with me in haunting fashion. It seems clear that Elias hasn't done anything wrong, but nevertheless he's doomed, and worst of all, the swans fly away from him in his dream: he is not only physically but thematically cursed.

But apparently they don't.<br />Quibbles with the selection process aside:<br />I liked Robin Hobb's Rain Wild story. Though it doesn't reveal anything readers of the novels won't know, it is a strong character-driven work with plenty of tension.<br />I was a bit disappointed in George Martin's Ice &amp; Fire story. It is well-written, but it doesn't attain the level of grimth his work often does. (Though there is a very cool fight scene.) The twist ending happens a bit too fast and wraps things up a bit too neatly for me.<br />Diana Gabaldon's Lord John story also disappointed me a bit, for three reasons: no actual speculative element; a somewhat confused plot that feels not quite put together yet; and NO romance, despite tantalizing hints. Unfair! Still, it's an interesting time period and a character with a lot of potential. I didn't know about the novel and I mean to go read it now.<br />Don't read Anne McCaffrey's Moreta story. That's all I can say. It totally spoils the tragedy of the novel Moreta, it has several internal inconsistencies, and it lacks tension. I'd reread the novel instead.<br />Neil Gaiman's Shadow story is very good -- in fact I think I liked it better than I did American Gods. It's atmospheric and skillfully written. I wanted to know more about the significance of the ritual, and more about what the freeing of the gods would mean, but it's still a good one.	2004-02-03

Marron, a young member of an authoritarian Templar-like order, and Julianne and Elisande, two young noblewomen, must face conflicting loyalties and dark magic in a world on the brink of holy war.<br />Brenchley writes beautifully on a sentence level and incorporates some nice elements of darkness. Marron and his master/lover Sieur Anton are intriguing characters; I found both young women a bit too perky, but not irretrievable. The plot is fast-paced and high in tension, though here and there the author leaves a thread unresolved (and apparently not to be resolved in sequels). The worldbuilding is reasonably interesting, though not highly detailed on a material level--I kept wanting to know more about the tactics, the weapons, the material culture, the economy, but Brenchley doesn't develop his world deeply. On the other hand, I didn't find anything silly or out of place, and the slim length of the book makes a refreshing contrast to some of the fantasy doorstops currently in vogue. <br />This will probably please readers of GG Kay, George Martin, Judith Tarr (it has some definite romance elements) and perhaps Katherine Kurtz.	2003-12-08

A little town is victimized by bad guys, until the gunslingers from outside come and save them, doing some damage in the process to the town itself.<br />The prominence of this plot, the relationship of which to the series' primary plot is as yet unclear, may be one reason why I found this book disappointing. Although the Wolves plot works reasonably well as an idea, it seems to lack tension, partly perhaps due to being drawn out over a long book, and partly because the final confrontation is brief, easy, and (to me) unengaging. <br />Wolves of the Calla also incorporates two other main plot threads, that of Callahan (Father Callahan from Salem's Lot)'s backstory, and that of the vacant lot containing the Rose. I'm not sure of the relevance of Callahan's story and find him unlikeable as a character, and since that thread is all in the &quot;past&quot;, it lacks tension. The Rose in New York is clearly relevant, of course, but the details of the thread are confused: why do the New York characters need to flee, and how will that help the gunslingers get control over the lot, which as far as I can tell they haven't established by the novel's end?<br />Characters remain appealing in this installment, with Roland's possible illness and Susannah's possible pregnancy adding much-needed tension. I like Oy and was sorry to see him apparently forgotten at the novel's end. Though the Calla seems a bit too archetypically familiar, the plate-throwing is a nice touch.<br />The illustrations are awful. I respect the fact that they're apparently what King prefers, but to me they look like rather cloudy pictures of strangely squinch-eyed, universally bucktoothed beanpoles usually firing guns while making faces.<br />A startling bit of deliberate authorial intrusion occurs near the book's end with the characters' discovery of a copy of Salem's Lot. For amoment, I was afraid King was thinking of putting himself into the story. That would be scary, and not in a good way.	2003-11-05

In a pseudo-medieval, pseudo-western-European setting, a neglected kitchen boy seeks his destiny as a Dark Lord rises in the North. <br />This iteration of the obvious works better than some others because Williams can write on a sentence level, and in general his plot is capable of engaging readers. For me, however, the book becomes far less interesting when we meet the obnoxious Binabik and watch the characters go on a silly, and tension-free, quest; the sense of urgency, reasonably present earlier in the book, paradoxically falls to nothing as soon as physical action starts and never really recovers. Battle and chase scenes are strangely uneffective, devoid of impact.<br />Williams' Sitha, his version of elves, are the book's strength. The characters we meet are reasonably well written, but even better is the historical element: the Sitha having lost their lands to humans who slaughtered them. Ineluki, now the villain, appears in backstory as an interesting character with a lot of potential; but I'm afraid that Williams, in the sequels, will simply portray him as a demonic adversary and ignore the possibility of interesting ambivalence.	2003-11-05

But do they bring enlightenment or destruction to the people who have become natives of Monde D'Isle?<br />I've been working my way through Liz Williams' books and enjoying them; this is my favorite so far. She creates a beautiful and fascinating world, peopled with interesting and well-drawn people. Ideas are particularly strong in her work, and Ghost Sister, with its genetically modified, wild and tormented not-quite-humans, is no exception. I found the stifling ideology that informs the new human mission to be believable, if fanatical, and quite frightening; I spent the last quarter of the book in terror that I was about to read another That Ancient Light. The characters are sympathetic and vivid, particularly the questioning, idealist Elerres.<br />Williams is a good sentence-level writer, but at times an overly formal, slightly stiff diction creeps into this particular novel, which lessens its emotional immediacy. Elerres' narration seems particularly prone to this. I would have liked the climax to be a bit bigger and more dramatic, and I wanted to see more of the world -- which in itself is an indication of good worldbuilding, since I got the impression there was more to see. Williams doesn't seem to write in series, but more work set among the Mondhaith would be welcome.	2003-10-30

This story, set among prehistoric people who are sort of proto-Saami, certainly outshines most of the Clan of the Cave Bear doorstops.<br />She isn't a great sentence-level writer, nor a wildly original creator of worlds, but what she does right is to create interesting characters for whom the reader cares. I found this book harder to put down than the more literary work I was supposed to be simultaneously reading. The author has a good grasp of personality, and knows how to engage the reader's sympathies. This novel, though not wildly dramatic in plot, is free of the slow patches that mar her longer Hobb-name work. I felt that Kerlew, an autistic (?) boy who is also self-centered and essentially sinister, perhaps even evil, was a triumph of characterization; she described this type of individual vividly, without perpetuating the superstition that such handicaps make the sufferer somehow &quot;innocent&quot;. Overall, though this is not a work of great literature, I enjoyed and recommend it.	2003-10-13

Paretsky has created a strong and real-seeming character who continues to appeal through multiple novels; the plot is both exciting and plausible; and, unlike in some installments, the antagonists in Blacklist are believable. <br />I like Paretsky's politics, as expressed in her books: left-wing in the sense of humanist concern for the working class, rather than in the sense of silly New Agey political correctness. This sensible point of view is one of the books' attractions, especially compared to the radical-right-wing paranoia of some other mystery/thriller authors.<br />Blacklist provides a good balance of action and character-centered drama, with some trenchant critique of modern politics thrown in. I highly recommend it.	2003-10-13

The plot, which uses the time-honored horror element &quot;something happened that was so horrible we can get hints of it only in flashbacks&quot;, makes reasonably good sense and incorporates some interesting ideas, though the existence of too many characters means that they shift disconcertingly in importance. Generally, the mood is successfully dark, and the horrific ideas are original, though I didn't find the story especially scary.<br />The characters, however, are a weakness in my opinion: they're losers, people who actually care about the difference between deathrock and Goth, kids who have no apparent interests, goals or dreams beyond drugs, casual affairs and garage bands. I'd say that -- without using the criterion of literal age -- there are no adults in this book. I had a hard time sympathizing with these pathetic, soullessly conformist waifs.	2003-10-06

Magical blue-eyed white horses; endless blather about self-esteem and \\"caring\\"; a dull plot with massive holes (why can't a Queen fire her own daughter's dry-nurse?). The only hint of something better comes in the stories the kids learning to be Heralds tell about the dark fates of their elders, but that's not enough to carry the book. It's sentimental tripe.<br />The idea of the Heralds is cool, except that we never see them do any Heralding in this book, and the Herald name is misleading because they don't do, well, heraldry, but it's an interesting concept that perhaps the author developed better in another text.<br />Anne McCaffrey's Dragonsong trilogy is a far better written coming of age fantasy.	2003-10-06

The worldview is dark, but not ridiculously so, and the characterization is skillful. The characters have interesting backstories and subtle behaviors. My only quibble regarding the worldbuilding is that this doesn't seem like 25th century; the cultural continuity makes it read more like 100-150 years down the road. Which is not a big fault.<br />The plot is complex and full of action. I thought Kovacs was a bit slow to realize the obvious memory-wiping function of the putative murder, but mostly the plot works well. Fast-moving and unflinching in its portrayal of brutality, this is not a book for readers who dislike violence. Another thing that Morgan does well: describing weapons, computer systems, and techno-gear in general and making them interesting, not just a list of macho stats. This has all the techno-goodies anyone could want, yet it's character-driven and powerful on an emotional level.<br />I look forward to the sequel.	2003-09-27

The anthology features Crowley, Link, Harrison (M. John, not the other guy), Straub, Morrow, Hopkinson, Lethem, Haldeman, Mieville, Duncan, Wolfe (Gene), O'Leary, Carroll, Kessel, Fowler, Hand, Park, Gaiman, Wolfe (Gary) and Clute, the last two being essays. Most of the stories are slipstreamy, as I'd define it; in fact Gene Wolfe's <BR>apparently traditional otherworld fantasy was the only exception. The majority are set in real world/present day; most are literary and sophisticated in diction; several, rather than traditional &quot;character with a problem&quot; plot structures, have alternative structures such as character sketches (Straub) and nested interlocking narratives (Link). The essays, of which I found Wolfe's more understandable, discuss the &quot;New Wave Fabulist&quot; movement in terms that sound like slipstream: authors who use tools from many different genres to produce something generally speculative-feeling, but conforming to few or no traditional genre standards.<br />NWF, slipstream, whatever it's called, it is certainly one, though not the only, cutting edge in SFF today, and I'd think that anyone really interested in professional publication as an SFF author would want to have a look at the book. Although I enjoyed a fair number of the stories (particularly the Duncan, Carroll and Mieville), I found a few of them a bit short on plot and conflict, too self-consciously literary. <br />Overall, this seems like an important anthology to me and I recommend it.	2003-09-17

But...<br />The initial scenes of this novel, which starts during the original series, focusing on other characters, are fantastic. But sometime around the capture of Flick and Ulaume by the Uigenna -- an event which should have been highly dramatic, but felt glossed-over -- the writing, for me, began to deteriorate. It becomes increasingly expositional and &quot;telly&quot;, until by the end we're getting stuff more or less on the level of &quot;Pell did X. Flick felt Y.&quot; There's a reason why writers are instructed to &quot;show not tell&quot;: the effect of so much exposition is to flatten the plot arc, lose the sensuality, and distance the reader from the initially very appealing characters. <br />I'm not crazy about some of the directions Constantine takes this. I don't care about the Kamagrian, and I'm much less interested in the Wraeththu as otherworld-exploring ascended master sort of people than I am in them as crazy, sensual, magic barbarians. I would, though, have liked the author's treatment of her chosen material much more had it not been so expositional.	2003-09-11

(Van Lew was a real person, though definitely fictionalized here.)<br />I found the book to present the Civil War in a morally simplistic, black-and-white, good-guys-and-bad-guys framework. Much of it reads like sheer polemic (going well beyond the POV character's beliefs). But the war was morally complex, with a tragic balance of good and evil on both sides. Presenting it in this limited way cheapens the experience of the real people who lived through it, and makes the book far less convincing as accurate historical fiction.<br />Part of my disappointment with the book may have been due to the fact I thought somehow it was about Tennessee Unionists, which would have been more interesting to me -- Richmond, Van Lew or similar characters and Libby Prison having been featured in many novels already.<br />Normally I really enjoy supernatural elements in historical novels, but here the ghost segments didn't work for me. Nor, really, did the sentence-level writing, the characterization, or the portrayal of the period. <br />I don't recommend this one.	2003-09-10

The sentence-level writing is often beautiful, and the characterization overall is strong. Una is a vivid and distinctive personality. Ahab is also surprisingly well characterized.<br />However, overall this is a book I hesitate to wholeheartedly recommend.<br />It's whale-like in its volume -- very long and *reads* very long because the proportion of philosophizing, exposition, and musings is very high compared to the amount of story. I felt there were too many themes, too many thoughts and symbols and ideas, and would have preferred fewer and better developed. The long passages of airy stuff get boring after a while.<br />I was disappointed that Una never really experiences a crisis or has to deal with her own actions. She does a horrible thing--which I won't spoil for new readers-- but never seems compelled to expiation. Throughout the book, Una does various things that perhaps she shouldn't do, but she never really faces the consequences. Though many bad things happen to her, she always has friends and supporters and the hard times don't last. Most unrealistic to me was the way she attracts one man after another.<br />I found the characters overall a bit hard to believe as nineteenth-century people: abolitionist, with mixed feelings about whaling, religiously tolerant, proto-feminist, overwhelmingly intellectual and constantly talking about literature... these beliefs did exist at the time, but I don't really see Una as coming from a background where I would expect them to be current, and when they are all combined and little dissent (with the brief exception of Una's religious father) exists, it reads like an attempt to make historical people palatable to modern-day readers. Which I'm not in favor of.<br />Lastly, while I applaud the success of a &quot;fanfic&quot; book -- one which exists as an homage to another book, using some of its characters and its world -- and feel it's a more valid literary form than it gets credit for, Ahab's Wife falls into a common fanfic trap. That's having the main character romantically involved with several characters from the original book. Ahab was a given and works fine, but there's another character Una ends up with, and that element did not work for me at all; it seems unnecessary and inappropriate somehow.<br />The vast amount of critical praise for this book surprises me a bit. It's an interesting effort, but I can't see it as great literature.	2003-09-01

They're *interesting* people, as she portrays them, but nothing that I, as a non-expert, have read about these cultures' actual religion, social structure, or archeology matches what Scott has devised. We don't know much about early Celtic religion, but Scott's book doesn't even take into account what we do know; here are the Iceni apparently without Epona (though Scott spells them 'Eceni' for some reason). She seems to have based her Celts on Native Americans to some extent (dreams of totem animals, for example), and I'm not sure there's historical justification for that. I was confused by the portrayal of Boudica as fighting beside Caractacus against an initial Roman invasion (the work on Boudica I have previously seen has her first encountering Romans in her own homeland), and I found the gender equality in the society unbelievable. I could accept spiritual and perhaps political power in women's hands, but I can't believe that women warriors would be common in a culture that fights primarily hand to hand.<br />However, I was able to look past these issues and think of the book as semi-fantasy, and on that level I enjoyed it. The plot is dramatic, perhaps a bit over-long, but with plenty of action and lots of pain for the characters. The latter are reasonably appealing, with the troubled Ban a standout. I was disappointed with the rapid demise of Amminios, who was shaping up to be an intelligent and interesting antagonist. But the dark ending makes up for a lot. I will be reading the sequel.	2003-09-01

The first is the plot, so-called. Kydd and his friends go through one apparent challenge after another, but all are easily resolved. Just as the drama starts to build, the characters solve the problem or the danger goes away, resulting in repeated anticlimaxes. The plot does not seem to have an overall arc or a structure of building tension... essentially, there's no point.<br />The second problem is with characterization. Though the characters are appealing enough in themselves, they're never challenged and none of their experiences seem to change them. They don't develop through the book. <br />I can't really recommend this.	2003-08-27

They don't promise that long-term POV characters, ones readers will presumably have been attached to, won't die. They don't promise that climaxes will occur as expected, won't have any strange twists, or won't involve mistakes of cosmic proportions.<br />But they do, implicitly, promise that deaths (and other ways of ending up) and the resolutions of plots and themes will be developed. This is the &quot;contract&quot; that I feel was broken in this book. It's not that lots of characters die or that the end was other than expected -- both of those things would normally be good. It's that the author doesn't seem to care, to spend more than a line or two on the (often off-stage) demise of major characters, or to develop a resolution in a way that will be artistically or emotionally satisfying for readers. The book turns into a drinking game: Who will go next and how, and how few words will Cook spend on the event?<br />Add continuity errors, a weird head-hopping POV (there's a structural reason for this but it still annoyed me) and increasingly weird characterization (they've never been good guys but now they're outright villians in some inexplicably stupid ways), and this book just didn't work for me. I can only conclude that the author was totally sick of the series and the characters and decided to perpetrate a nearly 600-page joke on his readers. I'm glad I got it from the library rather than deciding to pay money for this thing.<br />The actual final conclusion is sort of cool and offers a bit of hope, and as always there are some neat scenes and twists on fantasy tropes. I really like the fact of the casualties, though not the way they were handled, and also the suggestion that the Year of the Skulls wasn't what everyone thought (oops), but overall the book is soulless, least developed where it needs to bemost.	2003-08-14

Many of the other important characters are either imprisoned in this volume or getting old, and the new upcoming ones don't hold a lot of interest for me. It's hard to see here how anyone could have ever fallen in love with Sahra, and Murgen, a favorite of mine, gets pushed to the perimeter. Only the return of Willow Swan, whom I've always liked, gives this book character interest for me.<br />The plot progresses, though I found the resolution of one fairly long-term suspenseful thread anticlimactic, accomplished easily and almost offstage. Particularly at the end, events become hard to follow and jump around. There's a sense of ennui about the whole thing, of &quot;so what?&quot;. Followers of the series will nevertheless want to see what happens and progress to the (so far) final volume.<br />I really like the way the catchy title of each book is foreshadowed in the preceding volume; a clever touch by the author.	2003-08-11

Far better characterized than the early volumes, it's from the point of view of Murgen, the standardbearer. Disturbances in Murgen's consciousness and a concomitant decline in his physical state add tension. Though here and there a plot thread is not fully developed and the book gets slow about 3/4 of the way through, overall it works well and the end is an eyecatcher.

It's possible to believe, as I do, that LOTR and the Silmarillion (the latter not discussed by Curry) are great literature, and still see them as products of a specific time, place and culture, with attendant flaws. Nothing is perfect. In addition, Curry's apparent ignorance of modern speculative fiction weakens his arguments -- he quotes LeGuin, criticizes some early writers such as Peake, and mentions Pratchett, but beyond LeGuin doesn't seem aware of any other meaningful, literary speculative fiction. This means that his argument for Tolkien's uniqueness isn't very strong. His rather humorless approach also means that popular culture doesn't get addressed--he seems to have entirely missed the subversion in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.<br />I agree with many of Curry's criticisms of &quot;modernity&quot; and his environmentalist viewpoint, and it does seem that LOTR resonates strongly with those views, though I tend to resist polemical writing even when I agree. Readers who do not share Curry's views or who were looking for a more traditional lit-critical work may find this book less than congenial.	2003-08-04

It doesn't. It's largely a retelling in the author's own not especially wonderful style, with only a brief nod to thematic and source material. I don't think this is going to help readers understand the book.<br />More importantly, the book is full of inaccuracies! The author has chosen to &quot;characterize&quot; characters like Maedhros and Beren, giving his own idea of what's going on in their heads--characterizations that are unsupported in the text. &quot;Maedhros' mind was in a turmoil&quot;, things like that. One can make such interpretations in terms of one's personal understanding of the text, but they are not in fact explicit in Tolkien's words. And there are literal inaccuracies, mostly small, but annoying -- &quot;elfin&quot; for &quot;elven&quot;, the assertion that none of Feanor's sons were married (not the case), and so on. It's clear that the author isn't familiar with Christopher Tolkien's exegeses, but even allowing for that he has not represented the published Silmarillion text accurately here.	2003-08-04

It didn't surprise me that he comes to a bad end, though I would have liked a bit more characterization along the way. <br />I had some issues of believability with this one. The whole windwhales/menhirs thread has never been my favorite -- a bit too whimsical and surreal for me. As well, I struggled to believe that the layabout Smeds could somehow become a hardcore assassin, killing person after person with a single stab.<br />There was something more than usually vague and skipped-over about the writing, too. Exile, a potentially interesting character despite coming out of nowhere, gets only a scant glance before he's taken out (killed or wounded? we aren't told). More than once, Cook left it unclear whether a character had actually died in a scene. <br />To sum up, the book has interesting elements but feels a bit sloppy and rough. However, people who have been following the series will want to have a look at it.	2003-08-02
1030853:US	51145127	R1095J671JOYDF	0156028778	990216712	The Crimson Petal and the White	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Crimson Petal and the White	In 1870's London, a group of repressed and damaged people try to deal with life and with each other.<br />For me, this book worked well in some ways but had some frustrating elements. Faber writes well on a sentence level (leaving aside a love for the word \\"puppyish\\"), and his moments of directly addressing the reader, even putting the reader in the scene, are great. That's not supposed to work, but in almost every case he carries it off. <br />As far as I could tell the period elements were correct, though I actually had wanted more about the perfume industry, which the author seems to have found boring (considering the way all the characters react to it). <br />The characters are well-drawn, believable, and not especially sympathetic. They make mistakes, change their minds, go crazy, and in general act real. I regretted, though, never really seeing why William changed his mind about Sugar. What exactly prompts that? It comes out of nowhere -- or, at least, out of some missing his wife and insecurity about his manliness, but there's no moment of change or decision shown. Because of that, a reasonably appealing character changes to an idiotic villain in a trice. <br />Despite the book's considerable length and the fact that there isn't much physical danger or action through most of it, I found it a reasonably gripping read. Faber uses physical frailty well as a source of tension. However, at the conclusion, I needed more closure -- just a line or two might have done -- regarding how Sophie would react to what Sugar did.	2003-07-29

He's an engaging, well-drawn character, but what happened to the other protagonists from the first book? I would have liked to follow them as well.<br />The book is completely from Claiborne's perspective, including his feelings about secession and the Confederate flag (which some modern readers may find disconcerting, but which seem historically probable) and slavery. Some of the secondary characters -- Olivia, Minter, Henshaw -- show promise, but vanish disappointingly; Minter, a main antagonist, is hustled out of the story in an expository section, and it's not clear whether Henshaw survives to the end of the book or not. An African-American point of view would have made a good counterpoint, but unlike in the first book Poyer does not give us one, and Ker's servant Romulus seems more a stereotype than a person.<br />Battle and action scenes are very strong throughout. The plot moves fast and grips the reader, and most of the sentence-level writing is vivid, with some striking images. Despite my reservations about the handling of secondary characters, I enjoyed the book very much and recommend it.	2003-07-26

Sentence-level writing seems particularly smooth. The historical period is evoked with great detail and believably.<br />Though I guessed the cause of death quickly (this made me happy), I never quite figured out what the motivation was that caused the victim to be murdered; the murderer is given various motives but the exact breaking point remains vague. As well, there are scads o' characters, and I'm not sure we really need them all. Don Prospero's manic Homeric crazes and rants about Central American gods are funny, scary, and believable despite their extremity. Sefton is an attractive secondary character, and his actions at the conclusion of the book give it a needed touch of seriousness.<br />At times, with the atmosphere of old gods and sacrifices, I felt as if Hambly had been tempted to sneak in a bit of the dark fantasy that she writes so well. I for one would have enjoyed that.<br />Exciting and well worth reading, though not as thematically serious as some of the other books in the series have been. I recommend it.	2003-07-25

The story of conflict between Powys and Mercia in the eighth century, it is primarily from the point of view of Cynfarch &quot;Brys&quot;, who becomes pencerdd, chief poet, in Powys. <br />Sentence-level writing is gorgeous and unobtrusive at the same time.<br />The plot has an interlaced, knotwork-like quality. At times it's completely gripping -- Cynfarch's graduation in song, for example. Here and there it falters a little, as when the characters visit Aachen, but it never lost my interest. Because of the political complexities and the huge number of characters, some with similar names, the book requires a lot of attention and the name lists are vital. Even having studied this period, I had some trouble keeping up, but the work is worth it.<br />Characters are deep in a subtle way -- there's not a lot of introspection and emoting &quot;on-stage&quot;; the reader has to watch for it. Mayse has created a host of attractive and vivid individuals; Brys, Heilyn, Meirwen, Gwydron, and the sadistic Cenwulf stand out.<br />This is a subtle book, again, and sometimes I wanted a bit more visceral impact. The battles and actions scenes are good, but could stand a touch more grit. The themes of slavery in Mercia and Cenwulf's sadism aren't completely developed -- which means, really, that the author chose to be less melodramatic with the subject than I would have been. Overall, Mayse's choice of tone works well, reminding me of the medieval Welsh poetry with which she is clearly conversant.<br />Historical accuracy is one of the book's strengths. A lot is, inevitably, speculation, but it worked for me. I'm not sure people were quite as relaxed about romantic relationships as she portrays, but who knows? The characters had believable period mentalities and the details of daily life were well-portrayed. I did wonder why no one ever sang or mentioned the epic poem Y Gododdin -- surely familiar material to Brys. (The events are briefly mentioned, but not the poem.) Perhaps, given the political difficulties Mayse postulates between southern and the descendants of northern dynasties, Aneirin's poem was politically incorrect. In any case, it's a pleasure to read a historical novel by an author who knows the sources. Many other novels set in medieval Wales have not had that advantage in their upbringing.<br />I love the tragic, though not utterly hopeless, quality of the end.	2003-07-24

I found nothing that seemed anachronistic here; the characters are steeped in the thought, literature, and problems of their times.<br />Sometimes the cleverness detracts from the story. The unusual dialogue punctuation in particular makes conversations hard to follow. At times the themes have great power, but too often they, as well as plot and characterization, sag under the weight of verbal expression. A framing device -- as well as a puzzling new voice coming in at the end -- doesn't add much and seems unnecessary.<br />Overall, I found this to be an ambitious and well-written book which will probably lose a number of readers who can't follow its verbal twists and turns, but which is well worth reading.	2003-07-17

For me, the execution was at times overly opaque and oblique, so that I spent too much time trying to figure out the political system and why the characters were doing what they did. I can imagine this having been a fantastic novel if it had been written with a bit more grace and depth.<br />Nevertheless, it's a promising first novel with some interesting ideas and a generally good treatment of characterization.	2003-07-17

It was hokey at times, but it took itself seriously which gave the hokiness an endearing quality, it had lovely art, and it sometimes actually had something genuine to say.<br />Over the past years, ever more Elfquest books have come out, and while some of them have been OK, more have been increasingly bad, until this is the worst of all.<br />Yes, it's nice to see Pini-like art back (though in a careless and occasionally mutant-looking form), but the stories here are beyond saccharine. They're like eating a bag of sugar. The dialogue is unspeakably awful-- poor Strongbow is made to say \\"Scramble and ramble!\\" at one especially low point. It's as if the whole thing were a Highlander II -esque self-parody.<br />Gag. Avoid it.	2003-07-17

O'Neill has a wonderful sense of incongruity and sometimes of humor, but often his diction is distanced and formal, in keeping with the historical setting but having the effect of pushing the reader out. The speculative elements are fascinating on an intellectual level--particularly the characters who may or may not be physically real--but despite the guts sometimes splattered across the page, I didn't find them viscerally effective. What was metaphor, and what was not? The boundary is uncertain. The distanced tone tends to rob the narrative of drama, though allowing wonderfully subtle turns of phrase.<br />Here and there something in dialogue struck me as vaguely anachronistic. The leeries, though, were very cool.<br />An ambitious book and an intelligent one, but one which in the final analysis never really engaged me.	2003-07-16

Still, I never felt drawn in, which is a pity, since there aren't a lot of novels on the Mexican War out there. I really think that the emphasis on using only real historical people as protags is a crutch of sorts, and the effect is to make the characterization seem less believable than it would if the characters were invented.<br />Reasonably enjoyable, but not great fiction.	2003-07-14

Now, they have come to threaten humanity.<br />Wonderful speculative ideas and some gorgeous images and turns of phrase. The execution seems flawed, though.<br />It's never quite clear why the hadals become a threat at this particular moment in time. The moments when they and their underworld are discovered are told in pure exposition, robbing the narrative of potential drama. The hadals and their culture are the most fascinating part of the book, yet Long chooses to focus on human military weirdos, keeping the hadals mysterious throughout. Having mystery for part of the novel would have been a good way to maintain tension, but I wanted to get to the bottom of things eventually and never did. The novel's conclusion seemed to degenerate into an action movie without really addressing the larger themes.<br />Characters are fairly appealing, and there are some wonderfully grotesque moments.	2003-07-14

It's not underwritten, it's not boring (it all actually takes place in less than a decade, though only just), and although here and there the plot tries to go in too many directions at once, for the most part it works.<br />Tarr's books are romance novels with action and magic. Relations between men and women, often of different cultures, are central to nearly everything she writes. Readers who don't like this element are advised to stay away from her work--I'm usually not too fond of the romancey subgenres myself. However, she does it well; there's plenty of spice and both the female and male characters have depth and personality, though there's a little too much \\"war of the genders\\" phrasing for me. In Daughter of Lir, both Rhian and Minas, the foremost of several pairs in the book, are well-drawn, appealing people.<br />The historical recreation generally works well for me and the horse nomads are great -- I don't know if any actual historical or archaeological evidence supports Tarr's conception, but since it's such early history that doesn't seem indispensable here. I did find it a bit hard to believe that a strongly patriarchal tribe would have a \\"Year-King\\" ritual (which apparently is never performed except when the witchy antagonist needs to use it as a threat). Battle scenes are good, though here and there the plot structure gets confusing. The horses are wonderful--sometimes on the verge of being too anthropomorphic, but never sliding over. The fact that the matriarchal society is far from a utopia adds verisimilitude.	2003-07-14

I noticed that mutation (the change of an initial letter, as Balrog -- i Malrog) isn't ever mentioned, that I could find. In addition, of Elvish languages, only Quenya and Sindarin really get mentioned -- again, some of the more obscure languages were unknown to the public until the History of Middle-Earth was published. Interesting issues, such as the existence of Exilic Noldorin (I'm a believer in this!) weren't available yet for the author to discuss.<br />I was interested to find that the language of Rohan is really Anglo-Saxon letter for letter.<br />Because it's dated, this is hard to recommend, though one has to appreciate the work the author did.	2003-07-10

In addition, he uses the comatose wizard Smoke as a source of clairvoyant information.<br />Whoa. Trippy.<br />I've heard some readers suggest that this was where they felt the series started to degenerate, but I liked this volume better than any others since the first one. It was dramatic and character-driven. Although much of it recaps the events of the book immediately before it in the series, it's from a very different point of view. When we finally get to the &quot;now&quot; moment, it's powerful. The inventive structure even includes some direct-address second person exposition-- and it works wonderfully.<br />It is, admittedly, confusing and disjointed at times.<br />I'm not sure how I feel about what Cook has done with cultures in this series. He's got his pseudo-cult of Kali, and now the Nyeung Bao, a pseudo-Vietnamese ethniticy. On one hand I like his use of non-Western images and ideas, but on the other hand I think there's a bit of exoticism going on, and I'm not sure I wouldn't prefer completely invented societies.<br />Overall, I think this book, in its different structure and emphasis, gives the series a new spark of life. It deepens our understanding of several characters, while maintaining the straightforward tone and grey morality that are the series' hallmarks.	2003-07-10

That's a strong recommendation.<br />This is much tighter and faster-moving than the previous books in the series (and it is very much in the series; it wouldn't stand alone well), with a lot happening, definitely a page-turner. Like the others, it's character-driven, and Hobb has an excellent grasp of personality. I particularly like the Fool -- and 1/2 way through the NEXT book I STILL don't know the answer to the big question, and actually I'm getting a bit tired of the mystery, but in this volume the tension between the Fool and Fitz works wonderfully.<br />Whereas the Old Blood seemed a bit extraneous before, it's central here, and I was glad to find that characters who looked like simple villains at first become more complex. There are some holes in the plot, but nothing fatal. <br />I think this will really appeal to readers who like decidedly emotional, character-driven fantasy with decent sentence-level writing and an interesting but easily understood world. Hobb has the vital talent of putting her characters through hell down pat. It isn't a series for fans of &quot;idea stories&quot;, I don't think -- I don't mean that it doesn't have ideas but that it's almost completely character-driven. It is good solid fantasy and at its best transcends that.	2003-07-09

It felt as if there wasn't really enough plot here for a whole novel (at least at this wordcount) and a lot of padding in the form of expository introspection had been added in.<br />Something was strange about the way characters interacted: a tense, emotional scene would be followed by a mutual backing off, especially toward the end of the book where Lord Golden nearly vanishes from the scene. There's a realistic quality to that, but the characters never seemed to really resolve anything between themselves in any of these scenes, and I became frustrated with the &quot;one step forward, two steps back&quot; effect.<br />While in the first volume I loved the mystery about the Fool/Golden's gender and the romantic tension between him and Fitz, by the end of this volume I was ready to have the truth already. I'm going to be disappointed if he turns out to be a woman (it would be too obvious; I'm rooting for androgynous) but either way, I'm ready to know. The repeated almost-but-not-quite scenes have given the mystery almost a boy who cried wolf feeling for me. <br />Despite all this, I did enjoy the book. The events that did take place were exciting, Hobb maintains her good grasp of personality, and I like the emotional, character-driven nature of the story. I think the transitional plot here, since it's the second in a trilogy, created some difficulties for the author, but we do get important information. I'm looking forward to the third installment, and I optimistically expect it will be tighter and faster-moving.	2003-07-09

Painfully expository, though the battle sequences near the end are worth reading. Largely a romance novel, and quite old-fashioned in its view of gender relations. Also old-fashioned in its portrayal of ethnicity, but quite sensitive for the time period (late 1970's). Rather interesting in the light of recent history -- Kabul as the city founded by Cain. One character slides annoyingly in and out of a particularly irritating stereotypical Irish brogue. On the other hand, some of the landscapes are lovely.<br />I found my eyes glazing over, but I can't deny there were exciting bits.

I respect his attempt to present a historically accurate story, especially his attention to getting period mentalities correct.<br />I also find the genre and time period of this book appealing.<br />But I couldn't finish this book. I found the prose style plodding and overwhelmingly expositional. The strict adherence to real historical figures as POV characters means that there's only so much the author can do to them; if they weren't messed with, physically or psychologically, in real life, they won't be in the book. And I like fiction where the protagonists are damaged, tested, challenged, and generally put through hell. Over and over, I found myself skimming, bored. Finally, I gave up. I think that to write a story this expositional, this un-storylike, one has to have the outstanding prose style of a Catton or a Foote, and Shaara isn't there.	2003-06-26

It's a deeply romanticized account (written, after all, in 1959), and it largely avoids any discussion of the real issues of the war. In particular, I found the author's admiring portrayal of Cromwell off-putting. Though small-scale action scenes work well, in larger battles the author seems to lose control of her material, retreating into descriptions of maneuvers that may as well have been copied from a rather dry textbook rather than giving the reader a vivid story.<br />Having said all that, the characters are appealing and there are some lovely images. This book strikes me as a foundation, and I hope more modern writers have gone further with the subject matter.	2003-06-23

It suffers from sticking too closely to the original text: Grendel, an attractive POV character here, dies early, and we skip from Beowulf as an interesting young man to an old one who has come to terms with all the personal issues that made him interesting. A less close adherence to the manuscript might have served the author well.<br />I didn't find Godwin's conception of Norse deities appealing; they are comic-book figures, with no numinous qualities at all. Boring.<br />The recasting of myths and legends in humanist terms is a tradition of speculative fiction, and I certainly think it's a valid one. However, I'm a bit tired of characters who constantly question the values and mentalities of their times -- lamenting the cost of being a hero, and so on. I feel that theme's a bit done with, and it lends itself to anachronism. My interest in the character of Beowulf here was tempered by my weariness with the &quot;I don't wanna be a warrior&quot; theme.<br />I don't entirely understand Godwin's need to insert Christianity into every historical setting.<br />Despite my quibbles, I think that overall this is an enjoyable book, lighter entertainment than some of Godwin's others but a reasonably good retelling.	2003-06-23

Wells and some Mieville-like qualities<br />Under the Skin slowly unfolds as the story of a person who has been horribly surgically remade by her dystopian underground society so that she can do a job: picking up hitchhikers. (and read the book to find out why!)<br />The writing is smooth and eloquent, and the characterization believable though not overly deep. The plot, though not especially high-tension, works well for me until the end, which feels flat and unresolved--Vess is lovely, and one comes to sympathize with Isserley, but there's no resolution, even a sad one. I would have liked just a bit more detail on the grotesque transformations of Isserley's prey. <br />Thematically, I couldn't see this as the satire it's been described as. I could, however, see it as a story about forced personal change, about people mutilating themselves -- literally and figuratively -- because they believe their place in life demands it. However, the book really doesn't demand a lit-critical reading. It's a good story.	2003-06-20

The bits of Sarmatian culture and tactics, reconstructed believably by the author from the few extant sources, are probably the most interesting elements. Ariantes and his cohorts are appealing, three-dimensional characters.<br />The plot makes sense, though it's a little familiar: the Evil Would-Be Celtic Queen and her druids, something Rosemary Sutcliff, Patricia Finney, etc. have all done already. Bodica doesn't actually get around to selecting a Year-King, as this character type tends to do, but one gets the feeling she might. <br />The plot arc is a bit off, with a lot of the action skipped over and told in exposition rather than being presented with dramatic emphasis, with the result that the novel isn't as gripping as it might have been. Still, I enjoyed the book overall, and it does feature an outstanding duel scene.	2003-06-20

The writing was awkward and full of unnecessary exposition and &quot;telling&quot;. The characters' behavior seemed nonsensical, unconnected to what was happening around them--often their reactions seemed weirdly casual, and at other times just inappropriate and lacking perceptible motivation. I couldn't relate to them, and because of that it became hard to focus on the convoluted plot.<br />I like the author's Someone to Watch Over Me, but I don't recommend this book.	2003-06-20

There were good stories by Tanith Lee, Patricia McKillip, Carol Emshwiller, Gregory Maguire, Emma Bull and Kathe Koja, but nothing earthshaking. I was disappointed that none of the stories really seemed to have anything incisive to say about environmental themes; they tended toward retold fairy tales and coming of age stories. <br />I wish that, in these folk/fairy tale-oriented anthologies, real scholars of folklore and mythology would be invited to write the introductions. It would be interesting to get an informed viewpoint on the themes as they have been expressed in real people's beliefs and practices.	2003-06-19

His characters are original and vivid, and he seems to have the quality of caring about casualties; one doesn't get the feeling that there are expendable people in his world, which I like. The plot here is basically Foolish Science Unleashes Terrible Monsters, but it's complex and interesting. It gets a little too long at times, and there's one huge deus (or maybe \\"mantis-guy\\") ex machina,  but overall it works very well and the multiple threads all resolve intelligently. The monsters, the moths, are terrifying, but at the same time I felt a lot of sympathy for them; really, they're just creatures trying to survive.<br />As in The Scar, Mieville's world of Bas-Lag is the star here, and there are times when the sheer exuberance of his worldbuilding seemed to me to get away from him a bit. I think some readers are going to get lost in the layers of detail, and some people's powers of disbelief-suspension will be overtaxed (I had trouble with the khepri). Strangely for an author who was a doctoral candidate in economics and probably has his degree by now, he doesn't give much indication of how New Crobuzon really works on a practical level. But these are quibbles: it's an outstanding book and I highly recommend it.	2003-06-17

Generally, I found his historical portrayal believable, and his characters multifaceted, although I don't quite buy that Ralegh would be such a political innocent that he wouldn't realize why Elizabeth could by no means risk becoming pregnant. The plot is exciting; it bogged down a bit for me about 3/4 of the way through, but Ralegh's attempts to escape execution are fast-moving and gripping.<br />The different portrayals of Elizabeth in historical fiction are interesting. She's always larger than life, even when, as here, she has aspects of the grotesque. And generally, as here, she's shown quite negatively. I like the darkness of the way she torments her favorites in the book, though I rather doubt it's what really happened.<br />I disliked the homophobia with which James I and his lover Villiers were portrayed -- it's fine that James is a negative character, but the prejudice here seemed to go beyond Ralegh's normal Renaissance-era reaction.<br />In the final analysis, there's something self-indulgent about this book, about Ralegh and his endless self-recriminations and maundering. Still, readers of Elizabethan historical fiction will probably want to have a look at it.	2003-06-17

Though this volume doesn't have any scene as (inadvertently?) funny as the who's-going-to-clean-up-the-tentacles scene in the last one, Hamilton's thoroughly bizarre idea of what makes for attractive male clothing goes a long ways to add humor.<br />I like the &quot;romantic&quot; aspects of these books, and I actually think quite a few of the characters are well written, though there are a few too many so we don't get quite enough of each. I particularly liked the small and angstful Sage, but all Meredith's harem are appealing. There are interesting worldbuilding elements. Yeah, it's light stuff, romance fiction for fantasy readers, but there's a place in my world for that.<br />In this one, the plot wasn't great -- particularly the climax, which had promise but fell apart, segueing into an expository wrap-up. The ideas were good, but not developed. However, it did set up for a sequel, and if I see a third book I'll read it.	2003-06-08

The setting is pseudo-SF -- there's really no reason at all why it shouldn't be fantasy, since it's about magic, and then we could get rid of silly words like \\"neocount\\". The cat people are some of the less personable aliens I've run across, though their subterranean kin are more interesting, and so is the at-will evolutionary concept. The plot, though it does move along, has at least one huge continuity error (er, what happened to Ciani's having enticed Senzei to kill himself, or if that was a simulacra, what happened with that...?)<br />Despite all this, I kept reading the book to the end, and I came up with two reasons. One is that, despite it all, Friedman does write about darkness, and does come up with some interestingly twisted situations, even if they aren't all that well written. Another is the character Tarrant -- yeah, he's the cliche Sexy Devil, the vampire prince, et cetera, but he really is cool, there's no denying it.<br />I'll probably even read the rest of the series. Ack.	2003-06-07

Those who know, or think they know, insist that every race is gonna be a winner. Or that the author is really the greatest unsung genius in the history of specfic.<br />The horses don't always win, and I could continue the analogy, but it's probably clear.<br />Folk of the Air is a competent urban fantasy. (Probably more like a 3 1/2 than a 3, really.) To me, its best feature was the well-characterized portrayal of an SCA-like organization. Sentence-level writing is smooth with a &quot;transparent&quot; style. There's little in the characterization, plot or concepts that I can point to and say &quot;this is flawed&quot;. (Except for the idea that a sword could *cut* armor. I don't think so, but then, I'm not in the SCA.)<br />But the book didn't seem to have much emotional impact. I kept waiting for the big thing to happen, the moment of drama, the resolution of the &quot;SCA&quot; theme, and though battles and duels of wizardry do take place... it comes off a little flat to me, a little indecisive, as if the author doesn't really, on some level, believe in his own material.	2003-06-04

It might be well suited to a young adult audience because of the theme, the straightforward plot and the uncomplicated language.	2003-06-03

The identity of Isengrim isn't ever supposed to be a mystery or surprise -- the tension lies in how he can ever change himself back -- and it's nicely handled.<br />Characters are mostly appealing, but I never really bought Alain and Eline as villains. They seem like young people in over their heads, and their apparently genuine affection for each other makes them endearing. In addition, the lack of any closure with Tiher, the heroine Marie's secondary suitor, disappointed me. (I really thought she should have married him, but this wasn't that kind of book.)<br />The plot moves along well and never lost my interest.	2003-06-03

Perhaps because of authorial exhaustion, the end -- the climax readers had been waiting for -- was rushed and skipped-over, told in a distant POV rather than as the events took place. <br />And the conclusion was unsatisfying. We've already seen Fitz as a scarred hermit in the woods. To have him end up in that state once again seems circular rather than progressive. The bittersweet quality of the end didn't bother me, but the &quot;back to square one&quot; feeling did.<br />However, the book still has strengths, especially in the characters and the suffering the author puts them through. Throughout the series the worldbuilding, while not a work of genius, is solid, and the sentence-level writing is effective in a workmanlike way. Having read this series, I intend to seek out more of the author's work.<br />All comments are reader reaction only. Though I am widely read, educated and hope to be a professionally published writer someday, I am not an editorial professional.	2003-06-01

Despite occasional anachronisms in the area of mentality, which I suspect are deliberate, Gentle clearly knows her medieval history. The plot moves fast and rarely falters; the final battle scene is unputdownable. Stark, brutal realism is one of the book's greatest strengths, but there are wonderful moments of humor as well. The medieval mercenaries are so appealing that, when the reader gets the casualty list at the end of the final battle, the sense of loss is genuine. And yet these individuals could scarcely exist in any other milieu.<br />I didn't find the framing device, the writer communicating with his agent, as gripping as the main story, but the postulate of subjective reality was interesting and seemed fresh in the context of alternative history.<br />The one thing that didn't work for me was the final scene, in which the historical characters are translated into the modern day -- this didn't make a lot of sense to me, and it didn't work for me on a characterization or aesthetic level. That, though, is only a few pages out of hundreds.	2003-06-01

The apocalypse event is different and fascinating, and the environment and society in aftermath are believable. There's also a really cool mutation, though it doesn't get used nearly enough in the plot.<br />As well, the novel is character-driven and includes some nice, dark bits of characterization. Sadonya is one of the ugliest, most repulsive, most vividly written savages one could hope to see, and Berk's psychological twists are well done.<br />So it was a huge disappointment to get to the end and find this was basically a libertarian political screed. Berk makes the choice not to help his society, not to do the hard work and pay his dues. Instead, he sets off on his own, with the disgusting Sadonya, probably to die, but hey, to die free! It's poisonous ideological nonsense, and the author offers no criticism of Berk's selfishness. In fact, the character, Cormack, whose more cooperative ideas seem reasonable and helpful to their beleaguered society, is presented negatively throughout. <br />The good qualities of this novel, which also include occasional lovely sentence-level writing, couldn't outweigh its immature philosophy for me.	2003-05-27

Sometimes they overreacted; sometimes they underreacted. Sometimes they were trying to kill each other one second and having a calm conversation the next. There didn't seem to be anything in the setting's sociology to cause this, and I ended up lost and unsure what character plots and motivations were.<br />The plot here is small, with the characters spending large amounts of energy and general going back and forth to attain limited goals. That's a good thing, in most respects. However, the \\"real plot\\" was revealed so slowly that I spent much of the book confused as to what was actually going on, and found myself losing interest.	2003-05-26

When Tom decides to act against a copper mine, he does so not out of simplistic ideological purity but because of a complex of reasons, largely having to do with his own identity. (And he was uncritically working as a logger before that.)<br />Nevertheless, this is a profoundly environmentalist novel, with intensely beautiful descriptions of wilderness. It's an environmentalist novel because of the unbreakable connection it creates between humans and their environment and because of its challenge to the ideals of short-term profit. (At the same time, the problems of poverty are never glossed over.)<br />Owens wrote beautifully and incorporated stunning passages of magic realism. Tom is a believable character--confused, irresponsible (college drop-out), lonely, fierce, and ultimately heroic in the same way animals are in those old Western novels where wolves and mustangs leap off cliffs rather than be captured.	2003-05-26

Cook writes in a colloquial, spare style which often achieves a weird elegance. He asks the reader to trust him that information and characterization will be shown rather than told, and he follows through. (Though I still want to know more about the psychology of the Taken.) Though the plot and setting are pretty much those of standard heroic fantasy, the world-weary tone and the fuzzy morality add a new feel.<br />This is the climactic and the most surreal and magical of the first trilogy, and at times it got a bit too out there for me. I wanted more concrete tactical detail--the Black Company is a mercenary unit but one never gets much sense of how warfare really works in this society. However, Croaker's 1st POV voice is engaging, and most of the characterization overall is strong.	2003-05-26

They're solid, workmanlike fantasy, not works of literary genius, but fun to read.<br />Sentence-level writing is smooth though not particularly artistic. Characters are generally appealing, and I like the way the author develops a limited number of people over time rather than constantly adding more \\"names\\". The protagonist is believable and has a solid first-POV voice. Generally, the characters seem real and human. Two exceptions are the wolf, whose behavior doesn't quite match with real wolf biology, and Regal, who is too much of a cardboard villain, though he does get some motivation in this volume.<br />Plenty happens in the plot, but overall the book is too long and becomes slow; it could have stood to have quite a bit cut. But at least the things that happen are exciting and make sense, and the end is dramatic. The setting isn't as detailed or vivid as I might wish, but it does go beyond the standard pseudo-medieval pap.	2003-05-26

And the grit, the horror, provides a wonderful anecdote to all that Pollyannaish pap that's out there on the shelves.<br />In addition, Hambly's background as a historian gives her the skills to write wonderfully grounded, believeable fiction.

Gibson writes beautifully, and evokes the world -- this time the sometimes silly politics of mailing lists and chat rooms -- with great insight. His protagonist, Cayce (and why is she essentially named Case? I could never figure that out) is vivid and interesting.<br />On the other hand, the book takes a *really* long time to get going -- I mean about page 150 -- and at some points I felt like there really wasn't quite enough plot there to support the tense mood and the number of characters (at least three of whom I couldn't see a real purpose for). Without wanting to give spoilers since this is such a new book, it's about mysterious footage that appears on the Internet, and the various people--from magnates to otaku--who become obsessed with finding out who's creating the footage, why, and what it means. And the answer is a gorgeous one. But do I believe in the amount of danger and tension surrounding the answer? I'm not sure.<br />On some level, I felt like this was a &quot;thriller&quot; pushing really, really hard to be a literary journey of self-discovery. There's nothing in the least wrong with that--but it was the thriller trappings that at times did not quite work for me.	2003-02-10

Clear, sensible, factual.<br />This isn't a disinterested account, but it is a well-supported one by someone who was personally involved, and I find much of it convincing. As well, it's fun. Mosby puts waspish little comments into the quotes he uses from other writers, and smashes faulty arguments with skewering, sardonic humor.<br />Mosby talks about Brandy Station and Gettysburg, with a section of personal recollection involving the capture of Federal officers and dispatches. Some of his quotes of orders relevant to Stuart's route don't match what I've seen elsewhere--hard to say what's correct at this point in time. His argument that Gettysburg was not an intended concentration point seems well supported and plausible, as does his suggestion for who was really responsible for bringing the unplanned battle on.<br />He gives almost no information about the cavalry fighting on the 3rd, but does give a bit more personal narrative about scouting.<br />Overall, a lucid and helpful text, a joy to read.	2002-12-13

Under Grumble Jones' command, they went on a raid into West Virginia in early '63--something I don't recall being covered by Longacre or any other CS cavalry historian, but if the writers here are not exaggerating, it was an impressive accomplishment. No doubt, after riding 700 miles in 30 days, they were less than thrilled at shining themselves up for the Brandy Station review.<br />And, interestingly, where almost every primary cavalry document I've read takes a moment during the Brandy Station review to praise Stuart, his appearance on a horse and so forth, the Laurels are tellingly silent.<br />The battle of Brandy Station gets much detail and good description, and while there's a bit of a gap around the start of the Gettysburg campaign (perhaps not coincidentally), the rearguard fighting is well told. The account continues through various actions to the Valley Campaign of '64, and this is interesting again, because this unit has been rather derided during that campaign. \\"The laurel is a running vine,\\" General Early is said to have scoffed. According to this text, he might better have said, \\"The laurel is a raiding into West Virginia and bringing me supplies...\\" Two more impressive raids, one in 25' snow, took place during this period. So perhaps the Laurels weren't as pathetic as contemporary scholars seem to accept (cf. Lee's Miserables; Lee's Cavalrymen), though the unit historians do lament the state of their mounts and materiel.<br />An interesting and valuable account, and, though obviously written by interested participants, seeming to suggest that this unit contributed more to the Confederacy than it commonly receives credit for.	2002-12-13

This was useful and interesting. Overall, though, there was only so much this book had to offer. I wonder if the limited hard evidence for female soldiers makes any book of this kind an uphill struggle. A new volume on the topic has just come out, and I'll be having a look at that.	2002-12-13

Morton was only 18 when he joined up in '62 and spent seven months of the war in Northern prisons, of which he gives some description.<br />Forrest wasn't happy to accept this \\"tallow-faced boy\\" at first, but Morton slowly won him over and participated in all of his campaigns.<br />We get a lot of observations as to Forrest's character -- including that, according to Morton, he believed one attacker superior to two defenders (this is alarming) and that he was \\"at times the most insubordinate of men\\" (13). (Greatest general of all time, eh? I can't quite feature that.)<br />We learn as well about the activities of Forrest's troops, and I found it interesting to observe how often his men charged entrenched opponents (cf. Morton's description of the Battle of Dover, p. 76; etc.). I would be interested to know what Forrest's casualty rates were, as compared to other cavalry commanders and as measured against what he achieved.<br />The death (possibly a murder) of Captain Freeman, Forrest's deadly brawl with Lieutenant Gould, Chickamauga and Brice's Crossroads all are covered, among other events. Though Morton quotes letters between Forrest and the Federal commander Washburn regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, there is little discussion of Fort Pillow and it is implied, as far as I can tell, that Morton and his artillery weren't there--which seems hard to believe, but that's what the text seems to suggest.<br />A detailed account, a vital source for the activities and personality of Forrest. Limited personal narrative, with Morton tending to refer to himself in the third person, but quite vivid nonetheless. For anyone wanting to understand the war in the West this would be indispensable.	2002-12-13

I'd recommend reading it in conjunction with Lee's Cavalrymen, Longacre's latest book.<br />Longacre gives a good picture of the various roles of mid-19th century cavalry, compares/contrasts ANV and AOP cavalry, and criticizes the current tactics of mounted assault. As in his later work, he opines that Confederates often didn't like to fight with sabers, and I still wish he would provide more documentary evidence for that. His point regarding the difficulties of poorly armed troopers who could either fight only on foot or only mounted, is well taken.<br />The description of the campaign itself starts with Brandy Station, goes through Aldie, Middleburg and Upperville, and then follows the various cavalry units as they traveled north. The fighting behind the Union right on July 3 gets a lot of time, as does the desperate rearguard action after the battle. <br />Longacre generally feels that CS cavalry retained the advantage throughout the campaign, for which he more or less blames Federal leadership. He effectively demolishes the argument that Stuart was not following orders or was \\"joy-riding\\" during the march into Pennsylvania, and speaks harshly of the performances of Robertson and Jenkins. He goes on to suggest that Federal tactical flexibility would serve them well in upcoming campaigns.<br />This is a detailed and useful study, made vivid by the use of a fair number of quotes.	2002-12-11

Told generally in a narrative style, the book provides a solid discussion of and evidence for Confederate cavalry dominance in the earlier part of the war. Specific actions are covered--just about all of them, in fact, which means there isn't necessarily room for a lot of detail about every event. Longacre also includes material on the training and daily life of the cavalry. Disadvantages in weaponry and materiel, as compared to the Federals, also get plenty of time.<br />Longacre gives a balanced picture of Stuart; it's hard to see how a historian of ANV cavalry could avoid writing about their commander for most of their existence, and Longacre offers both praise and criticism, as well as a couple of insightful points. He's not at all a Stuart partisan; in fact, one gets the feeling he would probably rank Hampton first in tactics.<br />This book offers a sensible account of the Confederate cavalry at (and not at) Gettysburg, and represents a modification of Longacre's view in his earlier book on the subject. In the earlier book Longacre seemed to accept the viewpoint that Stuart &quot;should have&quot; been present, whereas now, perhaps influenced by *Saber and Scapegoat* (which appears in his bibliography), he takes a more positive view.<br />Longacre is more original, and perhaps more questionable, when he analyzes the tactics of mounted charges. He claims that ANV troopers wanted to fight mounted, but with revolvers and other firearms rather than sabers, and I wish he had provided more supporting quotes, because I've read plenty of primary sources (Gilmor) where sabers are used with glee. His assertion that sabers were really more effective than firearms at close quarters is interesting, and he goes on to state that mounted charges really were of little use, being more or less outdated and causing high casualties. But did mounted fighting, which took place until the end of the war, actually result in more casualties than attrition, disease among horses and men, or the kind of dismounted fighting cavalrymen sometimes did in the West, where they were ordered to charge breastworks? (history of the 7th TN Cav). I wanted to see more analysis, more numbers and more quotes.<br />Certainly a complete and interesting account, as far as I know the only such work, and required reading for anyone interested in the topic.	2002-12-10

Parry probably did well to get out of America for this one. The grotesqueries of contemporary London are well (if not over-) evoked, and since Parry showed in his last book that he currently writes Confederates as cardboard villains, getting away from them strengthens the book. It all resolves rather easily for Jones, but it is a pleasant read with some moments of humor.<br />However, I think the author is capable of more than this. Jones is a strong character, with a powerful and engaging voice, but I'd like to see Parry create a protagonist capable of seeing the world in shades of gray. Jones doesn't change, and that makes four books about him, even though he's a well-conceived character, seem a little much.	2002-12-06

I would have thought the great narrative historian could have produced more vivid and engaging historical fiction.<br />Banners at Shenandoah is very much young adult or even for younger audiences; it's the story of a young man who becomes Sheridan's guidon bearer. One thing I did like is that the account is not romanticized. Northern depredations in the Shenandoah, scouting in Southern uniform, etc. are described--though strangely separated from the idol-worshipping view of Sheridan himself.<br />But I found the account vague, bloodless both literally and metaphorically, lacking in description and tension. The Rebels, in particular, are faceless--you'd hardly know they wore gray.<br />Not something I'd recommend seeking out. There is better Civil War young adult fiction out there.	2002-12-06

This is an anthology of short stories set in the Hell universe.<br />Among the elements of Cherryh's writing I enjoy is her mastery of the classical history and her understanding of the Roman and Greek characters she brings to the mix. This, to me, is the series' greatest strength.<br />Though this volume did contain a story by Cherryh and one by solid writer George Foy, it also contained a story--the first one, by Chris Morris--which offended me so utterly that rather than sell this book to the used book store, I will be tossing it in the recycling bin. Morris has chosen to represent historical characters by substituting insulting, juvenile, false, repulsive slander for actual research. It speaks badly for this anthology that the story was accepted at all. This writer had better get his mind out of the gutter and into some historical scholarship if he wants to continue to write historically based fiction.	2002-12-04

Though one reviewer's comments about sloppy notation are well taken, Rhea's scholarship overall seems solid, and he uses quotes to great effect to make the fighting come alive.<br />Not only Spotsylvania but the tragic cavalry battle at Yellow Tavern are covered here. Relevant to this, no other study I have seen, not even bios of Stuart, brings out Stuart and his troopers' role in initially forming the crucial defensive line on Laurel Hill and then deploying the infantry in ideal positions. Little known, but perhaps one of Stuart's finest hours.<br />Rhea seems even-handed ideologically speaking, and his criticisms of Grant and Sheridan seem well supported by the facts. I would recommend this book not only to scholars but to amateurs who want to know why the Civil War was a horrible conflict. This is not light reading. It is a story of appalling human suffering, courage, and unbelievable sheer endurance.	2002-12-04

It's not quite as tightly written as Swordspoint, and here and there an unnecessary scene has snuck in, but it's still well written and structured. A high level of tension is maintained, and there are scenes of great beauty and sensuality. (And some paintings I'd love to own.) Worldbuilding questions I had about the last book are answered, and the portrayal of historical scholarship is clearly informed by real-life experience (I think I took classes with Crabbe at UCLA).<br />The characters are deeply flawed--Theron immature and hedonistic, St. Cloud obsessive and driven--but ultimately human, and I found them sympathetic. Their mutual descent into madness, but a madness that is intertwined with truth, is skillfully handled. Theron's sluttishness did make me want to smack him--but if you're engaged enough to want to smack a character, the writer has done her job. I also found many of the minor characters appealing. <br />The very end faltered a little. I wanted a touch more of St. Cloud's POV at a crucial moment, I needed Galing to have been developed a little better earlier on, and I'm left hoping for a sequel, because the kingship theme feels unfinished to me. In addition, I wanted some ecological or economic trouble to be arising--why does what happens, happen *now*?<br />I enjoyed this book a great deal and highly recommend it.	2002-11-23

Revolutionary prophets and a mysterious killer threaten the city's rulers and the newly mageborn women.<br />I found this novel entertaining and generally solid, though it had a bit of a rushed feel. The worldbuilding is detailed and believable, though I noticed several elements familiar from earlier Hambly works -- the djinni, and the teyn seem awfully like dooic, for example. Writing is sometimes luminescent but occasionally clunky--bits of character history in the middle of high-tension action scenes don't seem to fit. Characters are appealing, especially the refreshingly nontraditional King Oryn and the host of female mages, though I found Raeshaldis a little less vivid. The plot is effective and fast-moving, but I felt that on some level the solutions were too easy, the characters never quite challenged enough.<br />I often dislike \\"war of the sexes\\" novels, but the theme was handled intelligently here.<br />To summarize, a more than competent fantasy novel and one I definitely enjoyed, but not a tour de force.	2002-11-21

I will miss these people and this world.<br />On a rescue mission to Reunion Station, the Phoenix encounters layers of political complexity, a hostile station government and a potentially hostile alien ship.<br />This book contains more action than many of Cherryh's other recent works; it's almost as if someone told her that her protag wasn't protagging enough, because suddenly he's the action hero. But he always remains in character, and the scenes are fast-moving and believable. It's interesting to me how much tension and action Cherryh manages to convey *without* describing a lot of gore. <br />There are also some humorous bits--involving the atevi response to what they find in the Archive of human culture, but most especially the first moment of communication with a member of a new species. It's not that common for me to laugh out loud while reading, and I did here.<br />A few plot elements could have done with a little more elaboration. I wanted to know a bit more about why the stationers at Reunion were so disenchanted with the Guild, and I would have liked to see meetings between long-lost Phoenix and Reunion kin, since rescuing them was the original reason for the mission.

When the government tries to impose the draft, riots erupt that affect the lives of a vivid cast of characters. <br />Baker writes in a literary but not pretentious style. This is Kantor-type historical fiction: following many characters and giving details of each person's past. Some readers will probably find this hard to get through; for me, it was effective, giving each character depth and ratcheting up the tension as I had to wait to find out what was happening to each person in the &quot;now&quot; plotline. <br />The portrayals of 1863 New York and Famine Ireland are definitely gritty, not to say grotesque, but one gets the feeling that vast and accurate research has been done. Baker's overall grip of battles and soldier mentality seems strong--Fredericksburg is excellent and the mob scenes are powerful--but the most interesting part is really the fire-fighting scene, with the details of the engines and the crews. He writes well about members of several ethnic minorities, presenting them as individuals and giving a vivid cultural picture without resorting to condescension or political correctness. The character of Billy Dove, escaped slave and shipwright, is especially well portrayed.	2002-11-15

Granted, the original text is not G-rated, but in the course of fictionalizing the author has exaggerated the nastier elements as much as humanly possible--the women as objects is bad enough, the fart jokes are *really* uninteresting.<BR>Eickhoff's introduction shows that he does have scholarly credentials, and when he's not being a 12-year-old boy, he does have a good sense of comedic timing. But too much is too much.	2002-11-11

Mark McLaughlin, Barbara Hambly and Mark Tiedemann also contribute strong stories.

The primary reason was the shallow characterization. I never cared about the characters' fates or felt a sense of tension or excitement. They lack depth and none engaged my sympathies.<br />The society Cornwell portrays seems somehow limp and tired to me, with little to make a reader sit up and take notice. There are some interesting bits, but overall I just couldn't find it engaging.<br />A strength, and a place where Cornwell's research did show, was the depiction of the building of the temple itself; the backbreaking work as well as the artistry. The illustrations are invaluable. Having seen Stonehenge, I know it's astonishingly beautiful, and that does come through here.	2002-10-30

Some nice touches of steampunk, though underutilized, liven things up. The world is detailed, believable and interesting.<br />Illusion is the story of a revolution, and the ugliness and evils of revolution are clearly well known to the author.<br />However, the stereotypical and somewhat one-dimensional characters (the heroine is spunky with a heart-shaped face, and so on) are a weakness. Though the plot moves along well, there are some holes in it (why do the nits of Nu-Nu only appear when it's convenient for the plot?). However, the author does show a pleasant willingness to be grim. The tone is a slightly distant third-person POV, which kept me from engaging as much as I would have liked to. <br />I recommend this book as an example of strong worldbuilding, even though I would have preferred more individual characters.	2002-10-28

Dawson's account of sailing as an utter landlubber (but a fan of Marryat's novels) is among the best parts of the book, amusing and anecdotal. Learning quickly, Dawson joined the CS Navy but quickly transferred to the artillery as an ordnance officer for first Longstreet and then Fitz Lee. His book includes Pickett's Charge, a not very vivid account of Longstreet's Burnside impersonation (versus Burnside!) at Fort Sanders, and the friendly-fire incident at the Wilderness that killed the brilliant young Micah Jenkins and badly wounded Longstreet. Not a deeply informative memoir, but a well-written and appealing one.	2002-10-27

He is on fairly safe ground with the first question. I believe that most reputable scholars now agree that a massacre did indeed occur. And he's not necessarily wrong about the second point, either. However, his stated intent to judge events by modern standards trips him up, his psychoanalysis of Forrest is tendentious, and his failure to discuss the massacre in either a contemporary or a military context robs the book of value.<br />Fuchs characterizes Forrest as nearly demonic--psychotic, if not downright evil. Largely absent from this section is an understanding of the culture from which Forrest came. Nor does it seem morally meaningful, if one wishes to discuss the battle in these terms, to demonize the perpetrators; to do so actually  minimizes the event. Forrest was certainly violent, but Fuchs' apparent thesis that he was emotionally disturbed does not convince. \\"The call to arms was an opportunity to fight the demon within himself.\\" (sic.) How can Fuchs know this? Forrest's biographer Hurst makes no such claim--and most of Fuchs' sources are secondary, not primary documents.<br />The description of actual battlefield events is less speculative and works better. A preponderance of accounts do suggest that a massacre -- i.e. a killing of wounded and surrendering men -- did occur, though the circumstances were certainly confused and motivations mixed. Fuchs' description of subsequent retaliation by USCT, abetted by their officers, at battles such as Jenkins' Ferry, offers information I'd never seen before and adds a depressing note. However, I would look at other sources before taking anything from this author for granted.<br />Lacking here is any real discussion of the fact that Forrest customarily threatened to take no prisoners in the case of a fort not surrendering; though it's mentioned, it's not analyzed. More importantly, in a work of this kind, I would want to see a larger analysis of massacres. Under what circumstances do they happen? In what other conflicts do we see similar events? What incites soldiers to such acts? The events at Fort Pillow would be far more informative if seen in context, not only of similar incidents during the Civil War (which Fuchs does discuss briefly), but of massacres in other wars, and especially of the mental processes involved.<br />Adding to my distrust of Fuchs is the huge number of misspellings and misused words (\\"postured\\" for \\"postulated\\", \\"jester\\" for \\"gesture\\"[!]) in the text. This may, of course, be a production issue.<br />Objectivity concerning ugly events is hard to muster, but my view is that historians should try. Fuchs does not. He opines, \\"History, however, does not judge or choose sides\\" -- immediately after characterizing Southern society as having inherent evil (sic.). The Fort Pillow Massacre needs to be studied, but I found this work to be a less than convincing contribution.	2002-10-27

Covers Forrest's pre-war life, wartime career, and postwar doings. The account of Fort Pillow is sensible, acknowledging there was a massacre, but putting it in context. Hurst may go a bit too far in presenting Forrest in late life as a reformed soul, practically a civil rights hero, but it's an interesting viewpoint.<br />It's not Hurst's fault that the information he gives made me view Forrest less positively than I had done before. I was startled to learn how frankly unprofessional Forrest was as a military officer, how impossible he was to work with; I'm surprised he was never court-martialled. And, without denying his native tactical genius or his sheer fighting ability, his no-quarter policy seems frankly foolish, and it cost the Confederacy lives when US troops retaliated--not an aspect discussed by Hurst. Characterizing Forrest as the South's greatest cavalryman, as his biographers tend to, seems contrarian to me. <br />Nevertheless, this is a decent biography; recommended.	2002-10-27

Stuart	Books	5	37	37	N	N	I Rode with JEB Stuart	More than McClellan's memoir, this is an early Stuart biography, and later biographies such as Davies' and Thomas' rely heavily upon it. McClellan became Stuart's AG in May '63, but his account starts with Stuart's youth.<br />This is a vital account in showing exactly what Stuart's cavalry did during the war: scouting, raiding, screening movements, fighting rearguard actions, gathering information, etc. One thing I didn't know was that Stuart's horse artillery, often under the command of the general himself and sometimes with regular batteries added, would take up a flank position during infantry battles and fire into the Federal ranks. The perpetual, obviously exhausting, activity of the cavalry also becomes obvious.<br />McClellan was present for the Gettysburg campaign, and his account is invaluable for this somewhat controversial issue. His writing becomes more personal at this point, and he recounts several anecdotes of interest. He continues his detailed recounting of ANV cavalry activity until Stuart's death; McClellan was present at the deathbed and ends his book there. This should be required reading for anyone interested in the cavalry.	2002-10-27

Written as a diary in classic 19th century metaphor and flowery language, though the edition I read had no editorial commentary so I was unable to tell if it had been revised afterward.<br />Neese joined Chew's Battery in late '61 and was involved in the Valley Campaign, giving good descriptions of Kernstown, Port Republic and Cedar Mountain. He talks at length about Ashby and the mourning for him. His description of Brandy Station corroborates reports of the prominence of saber fighting there, and his battery followed Imboden's brigade on the Gettysburg campaign, seeing action on the retreat. He goes on to describe the Wilderness, Spotsylvania and Trevilian Station.<br />In October '64 Neese was captured and sent to Point Lookout. At this point his account becomes difficult to read with scholarly objectivity, because his extreme personal distress and depression come through strongly. He describes prison conditions in detail. He was released in late June, '65. At the end of his diary he makes some statements that I didn't know what to make of--reflecting a fear that Unionists will read the diary, or a change of heart, or heavy-handed 19th century irony, or perhaps a broken spirit from imprisonment; who knows. In any case, this is one of the rare Civil War diaries which shows the emotional progression of the writer. In addition, it gives a good picture of the duties of the Horse Artillery, whose importance is often overlooked.	2002-10-27

The voices of Polemides, the narrator to whom Polemides tells his story, and at least one other character are used, and they're indistinguishable. This means that characterization, never a huge Pressfield strength, is lacking, and it adds a degree of confusion.<br />Pressfield, in this novel,  had a vastly complex historical situation to work with. It's hard to criticize the plot for the many turns and twists, for the fact that the reader loses track of who's on what side, what Alcibiades' current standing is, and who Polemides is working for, when the reality was just about that chaotic. What it means, though, is that the essential narrative thread tends to get lost. Long expositions of political minutia and philosophy slow the text considerably. Alcibiades, rather than an incredibly charismatic troublemaker, comes across as a blowhard whenever he opens his mouth (or pen) in this novel. It's hard to see how he bamboozled so many people.<br />Pressfield's great strength is the representation of battle, and that does appear here with the Syracuse campaign. As ever, he combines elevated diction with soldier slang to create a unique and gripping tone. Though this book did not work well for me, I believe in the author and feel that he is among the most interesting historical fiction writers currently publishing.	2002-10-27

Derfel is a romantic, an affectionate and idealistic man, who's also perfectly capable of hacking enemies into small pieces. Female characters, not always a Cornwell strength, are excellent here, especially Guinevere and Nimue.<br />The framing device here works especially well as things actually happen in the &quot;present&quot; timeline--careless readers may even miss the impending attack.<br />The &quot;past&quot; timeline has quite a bit of exciting action, though it does drag at times, probably inevitably for a narrative that covers many years. As in previous volumes, battles are an obvious strength, and the portrayal of Dark Ages Britain is fresh and interesting. As a former student of the period, I found little that struck me as incorrect here, though obviously much of the material on religious belief and mentalities is pure speculation. The only disappointment was an anticlimax regarding the loss of Derfel's hand--not how he loses it, but the description is lacking. <br />Thematically, Cornwell is saying something here about magic and religion; something especially appropriate to the too-often-ethereal Arthurian genre. I highly recommend these books.	2002-10-27

Standouts are Johnson's article on Civil War military history and the excesses of revisionism; Fishel on the Secret Service which wasn't; Starr on saber fighting. McWhiney's article sets forth the now-standard &quot;outmoded tactics&quot; viewpoint; his apparent belief that the South should have fought entirely on the defensive ignores political and supply considerations, and though he effectively proves that attackers lost more heavily, it's hard to see why a criticism of attacks should apply only to the South. By McWhiney's own admission, &quot;in half of the twenty-two major battles of the Civil War the Federals attacked&quot;. (281) While acknowledging that heavy losses were more damaging to the outnumbered South, a criticism of offensive tactics should surely apply to both sides.<br />Overall, slightly dated (another article compares Quantrill to *contemporary* Vietnamese guerrillas!) but solid scholarship. Worth searching out for the saber article in particular.	2002-10-27

His long account includes Yorktown, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Monocacy and a full recounting of the Valley Campaign of '64. (His repeated blaming of the Stonewall Brigade at Fisher's Hill and Cedar Creek should not be taken as gospel, though.) He was then captured and describes unpleasant experiences at Fort Delaware, with rampant illness the primary hardship.<br />Berkeley seems to have been quite war weary by '63, sooner than many of his comrades, and his depressed commentary punctuates his narrative--though he didn't take the oath until late April of '65, during imprisonment. Many of his quotes are worth keeping, and he gives an excellent picture of experience in the artillery.	2002-10-27

Nevertheless, this is an outstanding source.<br />Starting the war as one of Ashby's cavalrymen, Gilmor then moved to Robertson's command. He operated nearly as a partisan, generally on very detached duty, though with specific orders, sometimes coming from personal interviews with Stonewall Jackson. He gives a pretty good account of the Battle of Cedar Mountain. In the fall of '62 he was captured but was fortunate enough to be exchanged. He claims to have been a witness to Pelham's death in the spring of '63 (although I think I've seen another account which disputes the centrality of his role) and, in an act of macabre Victorian sentimentality, took a piece of skull as a memento.<br />Interesting to scholars of the Confederate cavalry will be the fact that Gilmor reports raiding in the streets of Gettysburg before the battle (so much for \\"Lee had no cavalry\\"). He was involved in the rearguard action at Williamsport. Sometimes his partisan nature got the better of him, and he was court martialled in early '64 for actions involving a train robbery, though he was acquitted. He gives a good account of Early's raid on Washington and the burning of Chambersburg, as well as the destruction of the Valley. <br />This is an exciting account of a hands-on participant who was wounded several times and literally crossed swords with Federals on many occasions. One can read between the lines and judge for oneself how much good this kind of detached quasi-partisan activity really did, but Gilmor's personal dedication is beyond reproach.	2002-10-27

The editor has excised parts he thinks are repetitive or boring, but in some cases these clearly dealt with the technical details of handling artillery, and would have been of great use to the reader.<br />The colonel of the 1st NY Artillery, Wainwright is interesting as an anti-abolitionist and a fan of McClellan up to the very end. His comment that he wouldn't trust Massachusetts or Pennsylvania not to secede if conditions were reversed (p. 207) is interesting, reflecting the strong allegiance to state in the North as well as the South. His views on the cynicism of abolitionists are intriguing as well; he believed that the radicals were deliberately prolonging the war to gain political power. His account of the fighting on Culp's Hill at Gettysburg is quite detailed.	2002-10-27

I've noticed that increasing attention is given to small press items which most readers will have trouble getting their hands on, as well as media, anime, etc. which are of less interest to me. It was disappointing to see that horror novels were just listed, not discussed. Still, the fantasy section described several works that I'll be seeking out.<br />Stories in this anthology have over the years become increasingly literary and perhaps are not the most accessible examples of the genre. Imagery and style take precedence over plot and character in most of the works reprinted here. Perhaps the best story in the volume was one about a boy who &quot;swallows a faerie&quot;, an elegant metaphor for creativity and its repression--I regrettably forget the author but recommend the piece. Also, Norman Partridge contributed a strong work of historical fantasy.	2002-10-18

The Pennsylvania State Troopers are interesting, appealing characters (though I wanted to know more about Sandy, the primary narrator). I found myself more curious about their on-the-job adventures, and more drawn to their camaraderie, than excited by the horror element in this novel.<br />Which isn't very interesting. It's the gate-to-another-world thing that King did so much better in Rose Madder.

This is a dark picture of the world, with graphic violence, moral ambiguity, plenty of sexuality (though not graphic), and no childhood or young adult characters (unless you count Per, who may be supposed to be in his late teens or early twenties). This doesn't mean I think it's inappropriate for young adults, but I'm a little surprised to see it marketed as intended for them. The diction occasionally slips into overly simplistic phrasing, but that's the only childlike thing I see here.<br />A basically exploitative corporation has invented a tube leading through into the 16th century Debated Lands on the Scottish-English border -- though this 16th century is in a slightly different dimension. On the 16th side are the Sterkarms, people reminiscent of some of PF Chisholm's wonderful Border characters. They're a fairly well drawn society, though the author sometimes overemphasizes their filth and violence in an apparent effort to sway readers' emotions. Caught up in the power struggle between the corporation and the local people are the young anthropologist Andrea and the heir to the clan lordship, Per. <br />Characterization is generally vivid, although Andrea spends way too much crying and whimpering, \\"Oh, Per!\\". The plot is fast-moving and believable, and ends on a bittersweet romantic note. Our sympathies swing from the 16th to the 21st century characters and back, ending in a pleasant ambiguity. I recommend this book.	2002-10-08

I don't normally like books featuring gangsters, but Winter manages to make them vivid without romanticism. Jinx, a major secondary character, is more appealing than he has any right to be. Here and there Winter slips into sentimental hyperbole, but for the most part the language is taut.<br />The speed of the plot here is breakneck but all the pieces seem to hang together as one layer of conspiracy after another is revealed. At their height events get more than a little improbable, but readers may well be caught up enough not to care. Obviously, there's a great deal of violence, but I only felt it was gratuitous in one place, the exploding of a helicopter with uninvolved \\"civilians\\" on board.<br />For a book that isn't my normal kind of read, I really felt this was well done and I recommend it to readers who enjoy hardcore thrillers.	2002-10-08

Poyer achieves an unusual feat, creating a junior high age girl character who's only annoying some of the time. <br />As people die mysteriously in the wintry Pennsylvania hills, a mining corporation faces a hostile takeover, and some begin to blame the killings on recently introduced wolves.<br />The corporate parts of the story are frankly rather boring until you reach the culmination, the reason for them. Poyer must have dealt with corporate vampire types before. The takeover and proposed restructuring ring true. <br />Believability isn't necessarily this novel's strong point. The twist, the criminal behavior of a character, comes with no foreshadowing whatsoever. Secret mines where trespassers are savaged by attack dogs? Wolves saving children from frozen lakes? (The wolves are described well and mostly accurately, but that bit lost me). Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book. The descriptions of the winter mountains are especially strong. I recommend it.	2002-10-08

In another, which at first looks like fantasy, people go on a slightly nebulous quest. The twist is that the people turn out to really be animals...<br />Tepper tries to draw out the device of not letting the reader know that the people in the future (as it turns out) timeline are talking animals. This requires some narrative contortions, and the result is an essential lack of visual description. In addition, I didn't find the animal society convincing, though the use of humans is a nice touch. Especially, the lack of opposable thumbs gave me trouble (we're not talking Uplift, here), but also the animal cultures seemed for the most part lacking in detail and color. I couldn't help thinking what Mary Gentle would have done with the same elements.<br />The &quot;modern&quot; timeline involves Dora, a police officer in the act of divorcing her strange and compulsive husband, Jared. Environmentalist quasi-Dionysian (though gods of any sort are rather absent) religion makes an appearance as semi-sentient trees take over much of the landscape. I found Dora a little wimpy for a cop.<br />Eventually, of course, the timelines merge, and produce some slightly improbable magical events. The revelation of what the future humans are, and have been up to, is a bright spot.<br />Tepper's ideas are interesting ones, but logical flaws and an overall lack of &quot;real&quot; detail made this book less than successful for me.	2002-10-01

Some of his best passages here are the &quot;battles&quot; between opposing magicians and shamans (we can never be sure if the magic is real, but the characters certainly believe in it). With Arthur and Aelle talking high politics, a witch and two shamans are having a private war; spitting, hopping on one foot, piling stones in significant patterns. It's great stuff.<br />Derfel is an attractive everyman sort of character, a powerful warrior but a bit of a romantic. Other characters are quite strong as well--in fact Cornwell, who doesn't always do well with villains, women and secondary characters, outdoes himself here.<br />Setting is heavily described, so much so that I found the plot to drag just a bit here and there. Still, plenty happens, and the exciting and believably authentic battle scenes should please most readers--especially since this was why we would read a Cornwell Arthur story in the first place! But even the battles aside, this is a good book and more elegantly written than I would have expected.	2002-09-27

I found the plot a little short on action, but generally well-structured. Characters are reasonably appealing, though Tarr's Alexander lacks the sheer fire of Renault's classic portrayal, and the relationship between Meriamon and Niko never quite coalesces for me. It amused me that Egypt's rebelliousness gets sympathetic treatment, while city-states resisting Alexander are perforce black-magic practitioners and baby-sacrificers. Touches of magical elements here are sometimes a bit nebulous, though Meriamon's Anubis-shadow is a nice image.	2002-09-27

Though some of the more propagandistic songs may certainly reflect such a deliberate effort, it's noteworthy that this view of Confederate nationalism contradicts the analyses of scholars such as McPherson and Gallagher.<br />Abel's discussion of field calls is useful, and he's certainly picked an under-discussed topic. Though I didn't find his analysis entirely convincing, the history of individual songs (I was glad to know I'm not the only person who thinks the words of \\"Dixie\\" are lame) was interesting. I'd have liked to see a bit more on ballads and traditional music which would have been known to soldiers of the period, but then that's not the focus of the book. <br />Probably a \\"get from the library\\" rather than a \\"buy\\" book for most readers.	2002-09-24

In this sort of work, though, I'm really looking for more innovative, new scholarship, and that's not what I see here.<br />I'm unable to refrain from mentioning that I feel the concept of Jackson having a &quot;learning disability&quot; is poppycock.

Stuart and the Gettysburg Controversy	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Saber and Scapegoat	This is a book that I've somewhat dreaded reviewing. It's a little hard to know how to rate it, and it's hard to review it without going off onto my own interpretation of the topic. (Despite the temptation, I'm going to try and avoid doing that.)<br />Nesbitt's essential thesis is that the blame laid by some upon General Stuart for the defeat at Gettysburg is unfair. I agree with him. However, I'm not sure I don't think he's right for the wrong reasons.<br />Nesbitt proposes several beliefs: Stuart's absence brought on the battle; no cavalry was left to Lee; Stuart was &quot;late&quot; for the battle; Stuart wasn't following orders; Stuart was joyriding; and offers to prove them false one by one. He is more successful with some of these proofs than others. He spends much of the narrative on Stuart's orders. I'm not sure this was the best strategy. The orders were confusingly written, we may not have them all, and after the war they were variously interpreted. Harping on the orders and on Lee's aide, Marshall's, possible postwar dishonesty concerning them tends, I think, to weaken Nesbitt's thesis by taking time and attention away from the real weak points in the &quot;Stuart was to blame&quot; argument. He gets caught up in the morass and makes some confusing and contradictory statements himself. In his discussion of the orders he does establish to my satisfaction that Stuart was not outright disobeying, though other readers have disagreed.<br />Nesbitt is perhaps on better ground with his discussion of postwar events -- the canonization of Lee as part of Lost Cause ideology and the fact that Stuart, being dead and not having been a favorite of some major hagiographers, made an ideal victim. Mosby's refreshingly lucid comments serve Nesbitt well here.<br />Time is also given to an analysis of the cavalry's role during the battle and retreat. Nesbitt points out, very cogently, that Stuart left men behind watching the Federal army who were supposed to stay in contactwith Lee, but he fails to explain why these men did not, apparently, do their duty. This would be a useful thing to know, as would the reason why much of the cavalry Lee did have was off with the Second Corps, thus out of touch with Lee--but not at Stuart's bidding. Also, though the accidental nature of Gettysburg and the fact that it wasn't seen as a &quot;high-water mark&quot; till after the war do receive mention, Nesbitt's argument might have been stronger, I think, had he focused more on those factors. <br />Some rather unusual photos grace this volume, including one in which Mosby looks startlingly like actor Kyle MacLachlan.<br />This book will be required reading for anyone interested in the subject, but I'm afraid it may intensify controversy rather than clarifying discussion.	2002-09-24

A useful study of a battle that doesn't get enough attention. <br />The author states in his introduction that he feels the battle has been misinterpreted, but he never clearly gives his thesis. That's a minor glitch in an overall vivid portrayal of the events. As a student of the 27th Virginia I was excited to learn about their heroic performance here. <br />The battle recreated in microcosm some of the war's larger tactical themes, giving a pretty clear view of the new power of the defense, illustrating the screening role of cavalry, and making very plain the fact that attacking in column should stay in Napoleon's grave where it belonged, so even scholars not especially interested in the Valley Campaign will find something of interest in this study.	2002-09-24

It's a long and detailed account, including plenty of quotes for human interest as well as an assessment of the battle's tactical and strategic import. In a larger context, it works well to fill a gap--cavalry actions get less scholarship than I think they should--and to offer a perspective on Sheridan that differs slightly from the norm.	2002-09-24

In retaliation, the magus changes him into a horse. In this form, he must learn lessons of obedience and courage, and finally find redemption.<br />Tarr is a horsewoman, and her descriptions of Hasan in his horse form are wonderful. In addition, her writing flows well, and this story has much of the action that her later work tends to lack. Characters are generally attractive, and there are some wonderfully active and humorous scenes.<br />Something bothered me here, though, and that was the reduction of the medieval Islamic enslavement of women to a mere plot device, to be outwitted by the characters at will. As well, the subjugation of Islam's enemies, the whole idea of holy war, and the horrendous custom of male castration get, well, romanticized. As a reader I'm certainly more sensitive to these portrayals due to current events, but even taking the book purely on its own terms, I think that these themes deserve more serious and critical treatment than Tarr gives them.	2002-09-23

It's the story of a floating conglomeration of ships called Armada, its fate, and the fates of several characters of varying loyalties. The steam technology and generally nautical/oceanic setting add originality. I highly recommend it.<br />Worldbuilding is the real strength here, I think. At times, the world may have even been too lush, too full of detail (I never figured out what a hotchi looked like), but at the same time the sheer fertility of the author's imagination awed me. As a reader who generally steers clear of pure fantasy, I found the world generally convincing and &quot;real&quot;. There were a few moments where I thought &quot;oh, come on, that's too silly/weird/out there&quot;, but the moments of &quot;Oh, COOL!&quot; outnumbered them by a lot.<br />I found the book well and vividly written, although the &quot;f-word&quot; got used a few more times in dialogue than I thought necessary... it doesn't offend me, but it started to seem like a bit of a crutch. That's a minor point compared to the many instances of gorgeous description. Horrific scenes in particular seem to be a Mieville strength. The first appearance of the mosquito women is especially creepy.<br />Characters in some way seem to be less the stars than the world as a whole here, but I found them generally well done. I very much like that Mieville doesn't have expendables. Even the imprisoned sailors whom the Armadans are trying to indoctrinate, and the many people killed during a savage battle, get moments of narrative sympathy. Somehow, the characters I liked the best came to bad ends -- but Fennec the spy/diplomat/? comes to one of the more gruesomely vivid bad ends I've read.<br />The plot is exciting, fast-moving and hangs together well, but I was just a little disappointed by the end. The book doesn't go out with a whimper, but it's not a bang either. <br />Still, I found this impressive and I will be seeking out the author's otherworks.	2002-09-23

If you wanted to know about medieval tax collection, here's your chance. If you wanted to know about chivalric culture, troubadours, or some other aspects of the time, you won't be in as much luck. But overall the research is very strong. My one quibble was about the presentation of contemporary Welsh culture as more or less Stone-Age; a considerable overstatement.<br />And the book presents an interesting character study, a man of extreme uprightness and honesty, who never changes no matter what temptations or ill fortune come his way.<br />Now, the problems I found with the book. Heavy-duty expositon; almost no action (though when the author deigns to give us some, it's good); and most of all, no crisis. Although moments, such as the hanging of the Welsh hostages, are effective, the sheriff is never really put to the test. I kept waiting for everything to go smash and it never did; the book ends with a whimper. As a story, I'm not sure it entirely works.	2002-09-09

Her language flows, and that's what keeps this book readable.<br />On the other hand, to me what keeps it from being a really good book is the fact that very little of interest (to me, anyway) happens. Romances and the upbringing of children take up a vast portion of the lengthy text. Battle scenes get only tantalizing hints. The portrayal of magic is intriguing but too often veers into the silly (as in the childbirth scene, which I found laughable).<br />I'm not an expert on the period; what I see here seems accurate enough to me. I think it's important to remember that even though characters portrayed in historical fiction are &quot;real people&quot;, in the context of literature, they're still fictional characters--and Cleopatra's ugliness or beauty is a matter of great indifference to me. The characters as written here are sufficiently vivid; the problem is that they don't get more active roles to play.	2002-09-03

They did much of their fighting in the Valley Campaign of '64, and those battles are described at length.<br />The writing here may be a bit too dry for amateurs. I had two major criticisms:<br />As a Californian, I wanted to know more about where in the state the men came from. Normally, in a history of a unit, one gets a roster with places of origin, peactime occupation, where enlisted, how dismissed and so forth. This information would have been interesting to me.<br />Secondly, the author is not to be trusted blindly on matters outside his specific topic. Especially, his statements on prisons and the treatment of prisoners should be qualified by examination of other texts (&quot;Portals to Hell&quot; is a decent secondary source). As befits a historian of a Unionist regiment, he is of clear Unionist sympathies and while I don't think he forsakes scholarly objectivity too badly, readers wanting to learn more about Mosby, the regiment's primary antagonist, will want to look at other sources as well.<br />Though flawed, this book still will prove invaluable for anyone curious about Californians in the Civil War.	2002-08-30

Cooke isn't great on exact accuracy of dates and events, but he captures a certain mentality well. If you want the Virginian-plume-wearing-chivalry Thing, you'd better read this book. And he is entertaining,  if turgid -- the character sketches of people like Stuart and Farley the Scout are the best parts, I think. A brief chapter on the siege of Petersburg stands out as well. The book does give a good idea of what scouts and detached cavalry units did, which I found useful.<br />Thickly styled though much of this is to a modern eye (and perhaps a contemporary one, since Stuart himself apparently considered Cooke &quot;a crashing bore&quot;, though he was too tactful to let on), it's still really a classic of the period. It represents a certain facet of Civil War mentality, and people interested in the period should certainly look at it.	2002-08-25

Once again, it proves that extensive research isn't enough to make a historical novel good.<br />Savage postulates that Lee is court-martialed over the defeat at Gettysburg, the trial taking place some time during the winter of 1863. This gives Savage an opportunity to run through all of Lee's battles (with a side trip to Jackson's Valley Campaign) and command decisions up until then. As an amateur scholar who enjoys reading nonfiction studies, I still found these segments excruciatingly boring. The more fictional bits, the court-martial itself, were slow as well and the characterization seemed flawed. Savage doesn't have anything interesting to say about Lee, his leadership, and why he should or should not have been court-martialed; he recaps other scholars' arguments with no particular insight.<br />The use of language in this book was horrifically bad. This is an example: <br />&quot;He had foresworn strong drink as a teenager for his mother.&quot;<br />Whoa. Think about that one a while.<br />Despite the work the author has apparently put in, I see no reason whatsoever why anyone would want to read this book.	2002-08-25

Stuart	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Bold Dragoon	This is an excellent biography, one which not only collects facts about its subject's life but perceptively and sympathetically portrays him as a human being. I would consider it far better than any other Stuart biography I have read. It succeeds magnificently in putting Stuart in a military context and in placing him within the mentalities and ideals of his time.<br />However, I think that Thomas sometimes overanalyzes, and sometimes relies too much on single sources. Broader evidence, for example, doesn't necessarily support the idea that Stuart kept Hagan around just as a freak. And one bit of data weighted rather heavily by Thomas came exclusively from the captured diary of the tactless Price. Occasionally I felt that Thomas protested too much, wanting all of his evidence to fit his picture of Stuart, when alternative explanations might have been possible.<br />An occasional \\"Then did...\\" construction melds a bit jarringly with Thomas' overall straightforward prose.<br />An excellent biography, however, one which transcends the factual and becomes genuinely moving.	2002-08-18

I found it quite helpful.<br />They Followed the Plume is primarily composed of a series of brief biographies of Stuart's aides, adjutants, scouts and other staff members, including famous individuals such as Farley the Scout, Esten Cooke, McClellan, and Pelham (who wasn't staff, but is included). Also included is information on what exact tasks these men performed, which I haven't found elsewhere and which was useful.<br />Little overall synthesis, and only limited discussion of Stuart himself, is included. I did find it fascinating to see how Stuart cared for the careers of his staffers, who in most cases clearly were also friends. Many of the biographies quote letters of recommendation and show the general's efforts to help his staff, even when that meant helping them to promotion away from their duties with him.<br />Quotes from some sources that are not easily available in libraries liven the book up. Many studies ignore the fascinating deeds of couriers and scouts, and this book helps to rectify that. However, its format leads to a certain amount of dryness, maybe too much for the casual reader.	2002-08-18

It asks relevant questions of other current scholarship and proposes topics for further study.<br />Gallagher's thesis is essentially that the South did not, as some scholars have proposed, lose the war because of a lack of will to fight, but because of military defeats. I found his thesis, and his criticisms of the lack-of-will scholarship, convincing. However, I did find some elements of Gallagher's argument questionable. He gives the Army of Northern Virginia an absolutely central role. What about other Confederate armies, in which many men suffered under much worse leadership? And Gallagher pretty much chooses not to discuss the existence of substantial numbers of people in the Southern mountains who never supported the Confederacy at all.<br />Nevertheless, the question which Gallagher proposes for future study -- why did so many people support the Confederacy for so long and at such cost -- I think is a vital one, and I hope to see it addressed.	2002-08-08

This backfires when an old enemy from his pirate days recognizes him. Fleeing to Madagascar, Marlowe goes back on the account, but becomes embroiled in the politics of the island.<br />I wish that there had been more description of the setting in this book. Madagascar, a fascinating environment full of many unique species, comes across as generic \\"jungle\\". There's not a single lemur to be seen.<br />I also felt that some plot elements never were worked out. Marlowe, in an exciting scene, rescues some stranded sailors. But these men play no unique part in the action afterward. Likewise, Honeyman, who keeps verging on antagonism but then proving himself loyal, would seem to have more interesting possibilities -- we never learn what motivates him.<br />The end, a kill-'em-all battle scene, works very well. Overall, I wonder if the author's heart wasn't quite in this story; it just doesn't have the structural strength and attention to detail I've seen from Nelson in the past. However, I'd still say it's worth reading.	2002-08-08

Told as a reminiscence from the point of view of Captain Pollard, The Jonah Man is primarily a character study, but doesn't lack for gripping action. The slightly distanced tone doesn't describe the horrors of months in an open boat graphically, but the mood comes across effectively nonetheless. After surviving shipwreck and near starvation, Pollard's real ordeal comes when he must face his  fellow Nantucketers. Though I was a little confused as to the exact nature of the epiphany he experiences in the end, I found the book to be an interesting study of individualism, guilt and redemption. Here and there character dialogue and thoughts seemed a little too psychoanalytic to be period, but it was a minor flaw.	2002-08-07

Coming from the Shenandoah Valley area as they did, one imagines that some of his followers were really from the mountains: did they share images of chivalry? In addition, I'd have liked to see more quotes from the irregular cavalrymen who presumably made up most of the supporters Anderson is studying. <br />Overall, I found this to be an interesting, if not flawless, study of mentalities, and a unique addition to Civil War scholarship. Anderson's descriptions of Ashby's personal experiences are especially vivid.	2002-08-07

It's an intelligent book, a book of good qualities, but it's also something I wish I hadn't read.<br />Ancient Light marks the return of Christie \\"S'aranth\\" to Orthe, now in the pay of an exploitative vaguely John Company-esque corporation. Will Witchbreed technology be rediscovered? What harm will the Company do post-holocaust Orthe? And how will Christie reinvent her relationships with her former friends and rivals?<br />Hampered by a slowly unfolding, jerkily paced and overly complex plot, this is at times a powerful book. It's powerful enough, especially taken with its wonderful prequel, to make me care; to make me care a lot.<br />And that's why I wish I hadn't read it. Without wanting to spoil the ending... to say that it's depressing is an understatement. It hurts. I suspect the book is a parable about interference and exploitation. It's not an unintelligent treatment. But it's not, by any stretch of the imagination, fun to read.	2002-07-27
1469451:US	51145127	R32IWPHBUS99RY	1590130189	268497301	Motoo Eetee: Shipwrecked at the Edge of the World	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Motoo Eetee	Despite the blurbs by excellent authors and the good reviews, I didn't find this book to be all that successful, and I admit I don't see the literary significance.<br />Four seamen -- the captain, first mate, an ordinary seaman and the ship's carpenter -- off a sealing vessel are shipwrecked on an island. The captain proves to be somewhat less than sane, and events deteriorate from there. Details of the castaways' survival -- diet, clothing, canoe-building, and so on -- as well as description of the island setting are given at length.<br />I found the writing style here a little mundane and sometimes wordier than it had to be. POV is strange, semi-omniscient with occasional forays into limited, including the book's conclusion.<br />Characters are two-dimensional. Thomas, whose POV we are most often in, is a somewhat unpleasant, selfish, crude individual. His hatred of the undeniably overbearing officers is a major theme, but it never really gets developed. It's all sort of childish resentment of being told what to do; there's no exploration of social class or any other deeper element. It's hard to care for Thomas even when he's in trouble, because he doesn't have sympathetic qualities. His friend Christopher is all-good, cheerful and self-sacrificing. The ship's captain is an unbelievable, half-baked fanatic, a cardboard villain one of whose major crimes appears to be an unlovely personal appearance. And the fourth character, the mate Morgen, is so blank that even the blurb on the book cover could only think of &quot;pedestrian&quot; for him.<br />The conclusion is peculiarly unsatisfying; we're left hanging, with the physical fate of the one still-living character remaining in the balance, but more importantly with the themes of the book, such as they are, unresolved. To a limited extent, the book raises questions about authority, fanaticism, and class, but it does not offer even limited conclusions.<br />It's not all bad. The plot does move along with sufficient action, and I found the book reasonably entertaining. I don't, however, think there are grounds for hailing this as a significant work of literature. A competent afternoon's read, yes.	2002-07-19

Nothing in the book seemed unbelievable or incorrect to me.<br />Jiles' use of language is clear and literary, though the opening of the book is a little distanced. I saw no good reason to eschew quotation marks for dialogue, which was occasionally confusing. Other than that I was impressed. Descriptions of horses and landscape are particularly gorgeous here.<br />Adair Colley, the main character, is a true survivor: selfish and self-centered, with no apparent loyalty to either side, or in fact to anything other than first herself, then her horse, and last her family. Despite not being the most attractive person in the world, she's reasonably fun to read about. Strong female historical fiction characters who are believable products of their time aren't exactly in huge supply, after all.<br />I'm going to be honest here and admit I prefer my Civil War books to be about soldiers and battles, which this isn't. (Why is it so hard to find the literary language use coupled with the active plot? Howard Bahr, write another novel, already.) The romantic subplot here isn't quite my thing, but it's believable, without melodrama. Again -- like Cold Mountain, without the jerk-the-rug-out ending. And I love the horses. I certainly recommend this.	2002-07-15

I'd rather read about someone who kept his word and did his duty. <br />The book seems to me over-intellectualized and wordy, and the nasty-twist ending a bit too cruel. Mentalities sometimes seem questionably period.<br />But it's not a bad book. Descriptions, particularly descriptions of music (which few writers can pull off), are strong. Frazier knows how to use the English language, and though sometimes I think he overdoes it, sometimes his prose is beautiful. One does become drawn into the story, and come to care about the outcome. I'll be curious to see what the upcoming movie does, for good or ill.	2002-07-15

It's written in a style both literary and dialect, and readers who don't like poetry may not enjoy it. At times the plot is hard to follow -- I think I got it, mostly, on my second read. <br />Ariane and Sylvie become lost in a world which I suspect is meant to be more a part of our own world, an inner part, than an &quot;other universe&quot;. Symbolism, dualities, and images from ballads fill this world. The symbolism is deeply powerful, because at its root it reflects natural themes: the turning of the seasons, the rise and fall of forest life, the orbit of the moon. I'm not at all sure, as some readers have thought, that the women failing in their quest would lead to dead perpetual winter *only* in the &quot;otherworld&quot;. European folkloric material also enriches the text immeasurably. However, readers without any familiarity with the images and the folklore may find themselves swamped. This is not a book that explains itself.<br />Despite the admitted inaccessibility of the work (I did wish at some point the author would simply define a hallows), the characters are appealing, particularly the wandering &quot;Mad Tom&quot; persona, and there is humor to be found.<br />It's not a book for everyone, but I'm very glad that it exists.	2002-07-11

After several years of vaguely described abuse, he escapes the pirate captain, Falcone, and flees into the hands of aliens and their human sympathizers. Now Jos' mentor, the &quot;symp&quot; Niko, trains him as a warrior and spy. As a spy, Jos signs aboard the human warship Macedon. But he finds that loyalties, rights, and wrongs are far more complex than he bargained for.<br />I had trouble with Lowachee's aliens. They are painfully derivative and frankly boring -- pseudo-medieval-Asian, fighting with blades. I kept expecting them to start quoting The Karate Kid. While they provide an interesting plot theme and are one of the loyalties compelling Jos, they are not well drawn in my opinion.<br />Another issue for me was the vagueness of the descriptions of abuse and violence. Often these descriptions were well written, but at a certain point one needed to know more about what actually happened. It is not clear that Jos has been molested until late in the story; there's little in the earlier text to suggest it. And it's a major point, something which heavily influences the character's outlook and actions. I understand the author's desire not to be graphic, but lack of clarity isn't good.<br />Having said that, the book gets exciting and becomes a fun read about 60% of the way through, when Jos has joined the Macedon (which is well described, interesting, and full of appealing characters) and one of the people from his childhood ship shows up. From then on, the story is intense and complex, deeply emotional, with a conclusion clearly setting things up for a sequel.	2002-07-09

Bizarre swamp people, ancient subterranean creatures, and angles from beyond space and time mingle in this literary horror novel. It's rather as if Kathe Koja had written _It_.     The literary language use is generally clear and incisive, though I find Kiernan's intensely poetic diction more effective in her short stories (which are exemplary).     Characters are young Goth-ish people; I would have identified with them a lot when I was 21. The nonlinear plot never lost my interest, though I felt disappointment that there wasn't more of a bang at the end.     Of greatest interest here is Kiernan's portrayal of paleontology and the tying in of that with ancient horrors. I thought the paleontology was the most interesting part of the book, and I would have liked much more of it -- I get the feeling that maybe Kiernan felt readers would be bored with too much scientific detail, but personally I would have loved more. The intellectual mystery gets a little lost in the book's artistry -- perhaps inevitable given the right-brain, image-loading writing style, but I wanted to know more about the weird ancient critters, darn it.    A significant horror novel, I think. Recommended.	2002-07-09

I needn't have. This is an excellent work of historical fiction, which outshines the book immediately before it in the series and is as good as the series' best.<br />Far from being \\"excruciatingly slow\\", the opening of the book is fascinating. It shows us the character of a murdered woman, before time and an unforgiving society take their toll. It also sets up plot elements that will be important later, and gives us a glimpse into a world of privateers, adventurers, and pirates pure and simple.<br />From there, Wet Grave rockets on a twisting, turning path. January tries to find out who murdered a woman who was once the mistress of pirates. Meanwhile, a more high-profile murder on a plantation is more demanding of the police's time. Through alligators, gun-running, hurricanes, more murders and various thugs, the madcap plot speeds on to one of the best climaxes I've read. But despite the speed and the melodramatic elements, the book never loses touch with human emotions. At times it is both powerful and moving. <br />Characterization is excellent. I can't end the review without mentioning that one of my favorite characters in all of historical fiction, Lieutenant Shaw, gets a huge role here, and his vivid combination of the uncouth and the heroic comes across perfectly. (If I had psychic powers, I'd make the author write a book just about him.) January and Rose develop too, continuing to be believable, human characters.<br />If I have a criticism, it's that the final conclusion is epilogue-style, going into a distanced ominiscient viewpoint. I didn't mind that, but I suspect some readers may.<br />This is excellent historical fiction: wonderfully researched, gripping, moving, and relevant without being preachy. Highly recommended.	2002-06-26

Dan Lenson, the hero, is shallow and unable to engage meaningfully with others. One of the themes of the book is the process by which he learns to connect with his fellow human beings. But it takes a long time, and he's a jerk for much of the story.<br />In a year I make to be about 1981, the USS Barrett is an experimental warship with a computer program that can fight the ship essentially in autopilot. Lenson is an officer on the ship. Not only are there severe technical problems with the computer system, but there are various rumblings of discontent within the crew. This plot thread is interspersed with the story of Graciela, a pregnant Cuban woman who tries to escape the island in a refugee boat. The plot develops slowly, and though the climactic portions are exciting, they take a long time to show up. Because of the year, some of the plot seems dated, as when the computer whiz figures out what a computer virus is: realistic for the time, but not very exciting from the perspective of 2002 (the book having been published in 1995).<br />Poyer was exploring the issue of homophobia here, and so the reader has to sit through lengthy revelations of ugly bigotry on the part of various characters. While the dirty stories and nasty attitudes are no doubt realistic, they weren't fun to read. Likewise, though the main antagonist, Harper, is believable in his ugly sexism and crudity, I didn't enjoy reading about him. Eventually, Poyer comes across with a genuinely heroic homosexual character, but as with other aspects of the book, the reader has to suffer for a long time first. It's a meaningful issue and I think that to portray it realistically some ugliness is necessary, because that's an accurate representation of people's attitudes, but it got hard to keep turning the pages at some points.<br />The last quarter of the book is a good, page-turning adventure story. Getting there, though, may not be worth the time.	2002-06-26

It's spare and brutal. Battle scenes are powerful, though the edgy, spiky, fierce characters and their interrelations are the real point here. As ever, Holland captures period mentalities well. The theme of same-sex relations is historically relevant to the Templars and is presented well here, without stereotyping. Only readers addicted to happy endings should avoid this wonderful book.	2002-06-17

I picked it up because the steampunk theme intrigued me. I didn't expect the quality of writing I found here.<br />Pavane is alternate history (also alternate-timeline, though that's subtle.). Queen Elizabeth was assassinated, and the Catholic Church has maintained tyrannical control of Britain and Europe. Only limited technology is allowed, and Roberts' descriptions of the steam trains and the semaphore signalling stations are beautiful.<br />This is not a book with a linear plot -- the title gives a clue to its structure. Its parts work together to form a gorgeous whole, but we don't follow one character throughout, which may throw some readers. In addition, elements of worldbuilding exist -- the long description of the semaphores, for example -- which don't directly support the plot. Some readers will be bothered by that, but I wasn't. I found the world, the Signallers' Guild and all the rest, fascinating; the sort of world in which multiple wonderful stories could be told.<br />Though we see each character for a limited period of time, Roberts keeps them sympathetic and interesting. The whole book has a mythic feel. Though written in '66, I found nothing dated about it. The only thing that might perhaps change from a modern standpoint is that I think Roberts intended the end to be entirely happy. From the perspective of 2002, it's bittersweet, with the beauty of what was lost shadowing the bright modernity with a dark counterpoint.	2002-06-17

My opinion is more negative than most, I think, so take it for whatever it may be worth.<br />The basic idea here is a good one, and Turtledove has the facts of the period down. To me, though, he doesn't get the feeling. I never felt transported to the times. And the characters, most of whom are historical figures, seem shallow; caricatures of the real people. The result is low drama and tension, even given that the theme was one in which I was interested already. I wanted more action and battle scenes, and more vivid characters with whom I could identify. A limited-POV soldier character would have been a godsend.	2002-06-17

It's about Caribbean pirates in a world where vodun (or Powers' portrayal of it, anyway) really works. It's not a great historical novel -- the author makes rather little effort to realistically reproduce mentalities and the dialogue is thoroughly modern -- but it's a romp, with zombies, swordfights, and a maiden in distress. The characters aren't deep but they're reasonably attractive. Recommended for reading on the beach.	2002-06-14

It's yet another retelling of the lives of Byron and Shelley and their crowd, though Powers also introduces new characters. Although the various characters go through horrific experiences, they have a blank quality; they're not deeply developed. But the scientific part of the vampire premise, the part about them being silicon-based and about the composition of sunlight changing and affecting them, is fascinating. I wish the author had explored that more.<br />Overall, I'd classify this as a fun, interesting book, not especially deep, with some intriguing ideas thrown in.	2002-06-12

He gives almost no background, no setting -- WHY are humans fighting the ants? Why bother with Banshee? What about cultural and other worldbuilding details?<br />The writing style was terse and I found myself getting bored, even in scenes with hordes of charging Ants.<br />Obviously, others saw more in the characters than I did. To me, they seemed macho, shallow. Felix is appealing when he's being Lewis, and otherwise just seems... blank. Perhaps if we knew more earlier about why he was running away from his position of rulership, it would help. The other POV character, Jack Crow, seems even more devoid of personality.<br />Maybe it was the B-movie elements that really did it for me. The Ants, Felix having been a space emperor of some kind, and so on. The whole thing just never really seemed to transcend that. There were interesting bits -- I like the theme of Felix having been sent to fight far too many times because of a computer glitch. Overall, though, this book seemed like it was trying hard not to be pure space opera, and not really making it.	2002-06-11

After all, the author is a reputable historian. He ought to know his stuff.<br />And I was forcibly reminded how much knowing your stuff isn't enough to enable you to tell a story. This book is LONG, and it's SLOW. Chunks of exposition fill every paragraph. Can't imagine a Civil War book with almost no action? We have one here. And, in its 600-odd pages, it only takes us up to 1863!<br />If you read far enough, you'll get to a really ugly rape scene. I don't recommend reading that far.<br />Language is basic, mundane. Every phrase seems to be something I've read before, somewhere. Here and there, in jarring contrast, purple melodrama sneaks in.<br />Characters are multiple, and I think perhaps that's the problem with the book's tension. We don't get to know any character well enough to care about him or her, and every character and his/her setting require new loads of exposition to add to the book's already groaning burden. This is not fascinating historical information, you understand. It's more like memorizing the imports and exports of a place you never want to visit. They also aren't very interesting characters -- they don't have much to make them unique -- though one of the women is named Largo Landau, which was good for a chuckle. I wonder if her nickname is \\"Slowcoach\\".<br />There aren't errors, that I can see -- the research is what one would expect it to be with the author's qualifications. On the other hand, I never felt drawn into the period.<br />I can't recommend this.	2002-06-10

Pierce has become less dangerous, which saddened me a little, but I still find him wonderful and wanted to see more of him. Jani herself remains an especially vivid creation. I recommend this series to people who like emotionally powerful, vividly realized, intelligently conceived fiction.	2002-06-07

Compared to the harrowing, boundary-shattering qualities of Dragonshadow and Knight of the Demon Queen, this is weak stuff. It's very much not a stand-alone novel, and the themes and character developments are simply recap of what we've seen before. It's the end of the series, and so it's all about wrapping up plot threads, but some of the resolutions are disappointing--in particular that with Aohila. Other plot elements seem forced and, though of cosmic scale, lacking in emotional impact. Things just sort of...resolve. Tension is lacking.<br />As a side point, the copy editing is incompetent, with a misspelling appearing in the very first sentence.<br />It's not all bad, though. If you take this book as a second half of Knight, an anodyne, it works better. Hambly continues to write about engaging characters, to use gorgeous language, and to ground her settings strongly in material culture.	2002-06-05

He chronicles an evolution in Union policy toward \\"hard war\\".  It's an interesting study, apparently valid on a broad scale, though breaking down somewhat when applied to local area studies. Grimsley doesn't really deal well with border areas, and although he could have used parts of the mountain South to compare Confederate with Union policies toward dissenting civilians, he doesn't do so. Some of his arguments seem tendentious: is it necessary to construct an elaborate theory of class conflict to explain the fact that plantation houses were more often robbed than one-room cabins? Surely the fact that the plantation houses had more to steal played a part, as well as any ideology. It also seems to me that Grimsley minimizes the abuse of civilians which did in fact take place, and has little to say about the trauma even of relatively restrained foraging. A rather jingoistic bit of characterization--rampaging Continental soldiers were \\"brutes\\", whereas American volunteers were democrats--is used as one more reason for restraint. Use of sources is good, though enforcers of the policies are overrepresented compared to victims of them.<br />There is definitely useful information here, especially in the portrayal of international legal theory and the evolution of official policy, but I'm not sure how well some of it stands up upon close examination.	2002-06-03

It's military science fiction, but intelligently plotted and well-written. Smith keeps tension high despite the relative lack of violent action -- Killian is physically falling apart, diplomatic relations between humans and between humans and aliens are tense, and old crimes are on the verge of being discovered. Characterization is excellent here, with a number of very appealing, well-drawn characters. The SF setting is believable and strong, and the plot is clearer than in the first installment. Smith's grasp of personalities and institutions is deft, sometimes tragic, sometimes humorous. I enjoyed this very much and highly recommend it.	2002-05-30

He gives his characters period intellectual interests and tries to give them period mentalities. He tries to go beyond shipboard life and portray the exotic bits of the late 18th century.<br />And he doesn't quite have the writing skill to pull it off. This is very much a sequel, so characters aren't really introduced; nor are they developed. The main character, Kydd, doesn't change or develop depth as the book progresses, although he experiences several events which might have affected him. Dialogue is often stilted, particularly when regarding intellectual topics. One sequence on land, involving a schoolhouse, is a clear case of the author having plotted himself into a corner and resorting to silliness to get himself out.<br />When Stockwin sticks to the sea, as with the Artemis' battles and the details of sailor life, the book is entertaining and informative -- though I'm STILL confused what quartermaster's mates (to which Kydd is promoted) do. It's unfortunate that the text often drifts onto lee shores despite Stockwin's frantic efforts, crashes, and heels over into a sinking anticlimax.	2002-05-29

Even Bear's mention of the South SF Bay salt lagoons, where I'd been hiking that very day, didn't produce more than a passing thrill.<br />The problem here is the plot. It's a basic thriller plot, so there really wasn't much excuse for it falling as flat as it does. Jumps in time and POV add confusion and destroy what tension there is. The plot element of the evil, seductive blonde is lame and overdone, and it's never clear to me why the main character ceases being a threat to the secret organization that starts out by trying to discredit, then subvert, him.<br />The characters go along with the plot: they are forgettable and flat.	2002-05-28

It covers guerrillas (by which Fellman generally means Confederate guerrillas rather than Jayhawkers), civilians, and Union troops in all their various permutations.<br />I found Fellman's scholarship to be generally well-founded, though he is sometimes a little credulous of sources -- there's one case where he quotes an unsigned letter to a hostile newspaper as if it were good evidence for an event -- and he makes some mistakes with events outside his purview (misidentifying Early's raid on Washington as cavalry only). In general, though, I found the research credible.<br />What disappointed me here was the lack of conclusions. We have description, and some analysis, but the book seems short on results. Particularly in his analysis of the combatants' regular army and governmental reaction to guerrillas, Fellman seems to contradict himself: on the one hand he chastises the Confederates as elitist, perhaps prudish, for disapproving of guerrilla warfare, and on the other hand he makes every effort to show just how horrible such warfare really was. At times, he overanalyzes; I didn't find the characterization of Civil War Americans as &quot;Manichaean&quot; convincing. You don't need to be a Manichaean to dehumanize your enemies in a war.<br />Despite these quibbles, I found the book valuable, certainly worth looking at for the study of mentalities in a region where war was literally at every door.	2002-05-28

Pleasantly, McMurtry doesn't subject any of his main characters to horrible deaths this time around. On the other hand, if you've read the other books you know what's coming, so the comforting effect of that is relative.<br />Native Americans get a slightly better portrayal here than in some of the other volumes. There are still psycho killers, including one really frightening bandit, but there are also brave and genuinely human characters. Overall it's a gritty version of the period just before the Civil War, with gripping scenes of torture and survival. As usual, there are strong female characters, but they generally come to bad ends, just as the men do.<br />I'd recommend this for readers of the series. I'm not sure how well it stands alone.	2002-05-21

After a nuclear holocaust, an order of monks has preserved what they can of civilization -- it's a deliberate reference to the European \\"Dark Ages\\", and Miller carries it off well. Society rebuilds itself... only to fall into warfare once again.<br />I found myself wanting to hear some of the stories mentioned only in passing here -- the abandoned and betrayed Laredan troops particularly caught my interest -- and that, I think, is a sign of good worldbuilding. <br />The story is told in episodes, some hundreds or more years apart, but the characters are still quite engaging. Miller's writing is a little old-fashioned and expository, but is also clear, lucid and precise. The combination of powerful themes and understated language makes this book a genuinely moving one which, in my view, deserves credit as bonafide literature.	2002-05-17

This anthology of thematic studies is a mixed bag. The scholarship represents one of the latest and most interesting trends in Civil War scholarship, local area studies. As such, some of the work here will be of interest only to scholars focusing on those regions.<br />Some of the articles are interesting and of value, but a few lack scholarly objectivity. I noticed that in several cases sources had been chosen strangely, with presumably honest and reliable Unionist primary sources contrasted to the silliest possible early 20th century Lost Cause historians; why not compare Unionist primary documents to Confederate ones? In general, as is common with articles of this sort, there's a lot of stating the theme and sometimes a dearth of actual conclusions. Particularly annoying was the study of the Unionist rhetoric of violence in West Virginia -- a fascinating topic if the author had thought to actually analyze the writings and speeches to which he refers, but he scarcely even quotes them.<br />Two studies of the East Tennessee region stood out as useful, and Fellman's article was intriguing although I'm not sure I understand his theory of subjective analysis.<br />Like most works of this type, this is useful if treated with a due amount of caution.	2002-05-17

Readers should know that the Roland story, Lunch at the Gotham Cafe, the airplane crash/Purgatory story, and at least one of the other stories in this volume are reprints. I wasn't expecting that, and I was disappointed. On the other hand, since the original publications were in less well-known venues to mainstream readers, they may still be new to many.<br />I found this anthology to be entertaining but not especially strong. A buried-alive (or, in this case, autopsied alive) tale starts wonderfully but falls apart at the end. The gunslinger story is a little silly. The Man in the Black Suit and the haunted hotel room story stand out. Nothing in here had the impact, for me, of something like The Langoliers.	2002-05-13

Godwin has done his research; that he invents Saxon resistance in a specific place seems inconsequential to me, given that we don't know *everything* that went on during the period. He makes at least an attempt to portray mentality, which puts him ahead of most medieval historical fiction writers.<br />There are some issues, though. Godwin's writing, especially in the early part of the book, is often grammatically vague. His fight and action scenes are insufficiently structured, thus confusing. His constant identification of the Saxons with the land conveniently ignores the fact that the Saxons themselves came as invaders. The text sometimes tries too hard to be meaningful.<br />Characterization overall is competent. I found Robin, in his more ignorant, loudmouthed, horse-eating moments, annoying, and tended to prefer Ralf.<br />This is a reasonable book, I'd say, but no masterpiece.	2002-05-10

There's no plot; no tension; no suspense. Much of it is actually a clip show, with Ayla and Jondalar endlessly rehashing their past adventures and inventions. Nothing of note happens. A & J return to the Zelandonii, mate, and have a kid. There are hints of conflict with the Clan but nothing happens. The characters are plastic, too-perfect people and the writing is slow, static and rife with both authorial intrusion and needless info-dumps.<br />Pages of truly bad rhyming religious doggerel -- which are, along with much else in the book, repeated several times -- add a touch of ludicrous awfulness.<br />It's boring.

It's the kind of novel where there are multiple plotlines and hordes of characters, and it's fair to say that that's not my favorite format, which no doubt affects this review.<br />Cook invents some of the coolest warships in SF, as well as a both intriguing and plausible interstellar travel system. Society is threatened by a really gruesome alliance of scary aliens, abetted by strangely changed and foreign humans.<br />It's got all the ingredients of a great book. But... for me, they're not quite put together right. There's too little focus on the more interesting factors, and too much on those which were less so, for me. POV characters die offscreen. Loose ends are never tied up. Perhaps most of all, Cook's writing is sometimes simply unclear. That makes the book annoyingly hard to follow. <br />I respect the book, and I really like the way it ends, but the details of the plot needed more focus and attention.	2002-04-17

Actions which may prove meaningless -- and sometimes do. Events incomprehensible even to participants. As such, Passage at Arms is a notably well-written book, but it's not an easy read. There's no break for the characters, and none for the reader either. There's no comic relief whatsoever. You're trapped in a tiny, hot ship with its crew and the narrator, a war correspondent. In first person present tense, the story seems to represent the correspondent's real, uncensored report.<br />Lessening the impact of this book were some loose ends (a blackmail subplot that never goes anywhere, which might be deliberate nihilism) and characterization which could have been deeper, especially of the narrator. Still, this is a good one.	2002-04-17

It's sort of a love story, but the themes are so half-baked that it's hard to tell. There's a lot of wanna-be style here, a lot of superficially well written prose and philosophizing, but not a lot of substance. The author even forgets that she's had Henri lose an eye at Austerlitz; later in the text, he has both eyes. The plot is insignificant, with events being drowned in maunderings; essentially, Villanelle and Henri meet, fall in love, and murder her husband, whom we are expected to believe is evil, with an unlovely appearance as the main (and shallow) evidence for that. Henri then ends up in a madhouse. A second plot thread involves Villanelle's love affair with a Venetian noblewoman; it seems meant to be meaningful, but it's not.<br />Setting is weak, with few historical details and little sense that we are in a different time. Action... nonexistent. Some intriguing bits of magic realism, and an artistic way of putting words together, don't save this book; I found it boring and pretentious.	2002-04-08

I didn't enjoy it all that much, definitely not as much as Stewart's other work; but at the same time I suspect that it's excellent of its kind, but that kind just isn't quite my thing.<br />So what's its kind? This is magic realism, set in present-day Houston; quiet and understated, with a story that's about people coming to terms with reality, rather than about any great conflict or threat. I found it a little slow and mundane.<br />Toni, the main character, has invented a connection with certain gods... they're really more like loa... from her eccentric, difficult mother. In Mockingbird, she has to deal with these gods, their possession of her, as well as her pregnancy. The gods are well described. But when they take possession of Toni... they tend to want to do things like playing the stock market. Whole pages of this book are devoted to online trading, with numbers and all. Probably someone's cup of tea; not mine. Lengthy description of the discomforts of pregnancy is vivid, but also tends to drag. There's not a lot of drama here.<br />But, on the other hand, there isn't *intended* to be a lot of drama. It's not that kind of book.<br />Recommended for people who like this sort of thing.	2002-04-08

Greg Child, a well-known climbing writer, is branching out and expanding his skills here. Overall, I'd say he does well. Climbers may want to be advised that this is *not* a climbing book; there's very little description of climbing and what there is has been written so as to fit a broader audience.<br />Child does three things here. First, he discusses the history and nature of Islamic terrorism in Central Asia. I'd think this element would have appeal to anyone interested in current events. Although some of the informational segments are dry, it's terrifying to realize the extent of, and the numbers of people involved in, violently fanatical beliefs. And it's tragic to think that some of the most beautiful wilderness landscapes on the planet are tainted by human brutality. The 9/11 tie-in here is obvious, since the group which kidnapped the climbers was tied to the Taliban.<br />Secondly, Child tells the story of the climbers, four young Americans who were taken as hostages. (We also get, briefly, the story of some European captives at the same period). And that's a slightly depressing view of human nature. While it's unclear how much warning the climbers had about the dangerous nature of the country they were visiting, it's obvious that they took a risk. There's something repugnant about these privileged Americans showing up in this extremely impoverished society with their CD walkmans, minidisc players, thousands of dollars of camera equipment (though the latter, granted, does professionally relate to their work for The North Face), and other electronic gadgets. <br />When they were captured, it appears that the undoubted courage it takes to climb hard routes didn't exactly translate. One can relate to their fear and helplessness.<br />Lastly, Child discusses the ugly attacks by other climbers and journalists, including Americans, on the hostages' story. Various details, even the story as a whole, were challenged by people who had never been to Kyrgyztan or interviewed any of the participants themselves. In my view, the physical and psychological condition of the four, upon their return, gives their story credence, as do the circumstances under which their gear was visibly abandoned. It also seems to me that Child is a trustworthy journalist. And perhaps most of all, if someone was going to make up a story about a heroic escape from terrorists, they'd make up something... heroic. Pushing a man off a cliff and running, though a sensible response to an extreme situation, isn't really a heroic act. Readers must choose for themselves, of course, whom they believe.	2002-04-08

Both are worthwhile scholarship, and Sears gives more intricate tactical detail, but Furgurson excels in giving the battle a human face. His wonderful use of primary sources makes the book stand out, and gives it an appeal beyond the merely scholarly.<br />For the most part, despite Furgurson's apparent lack of credentials as a historian, I found analysis and use of sources here to be professionally done. I don't agree with Furgurson's conclusion: that Jackson's death was the cause of the loss at Gettysburg, and that that led inevitably to the loss of the war. I also found his implicit criticism of Stuart's decisions as interim commander somewhat out of place; not necessarily invalid, but different from other scholars' analysis, and not to be taken as gospel. In one or two places, Furgurson clearly relies heavily on Bruce Catton's study of the battle in Glory Road.<br />It's the vivid quotes that make this book. Just as Furgurson gives credit to the common soldiers for enabling Lee's victory, so they have enabled him to write a gripping book. He's combed the archives and come up with descriptive, eloquent and revealing quotes from soldiers on both sides.<br />I certainly recommend this, perhaps to be read in conjunction with Sears' book, and preferentially to it if one is an amateur.	2002-04-08

It's an outstanding book, though not a perfect one, and is not for the weak of stomach.<br />I characterized Needle's writing in his previous book, A Fine Boy for Killing, as a blunt instrument. Here, he's refined it to a stiletto. Dialogue in particular shines, even evoking Shakespeare in its rhythmic qualities. His action scenes are still a little static and there's too much exposition -- one annoying habit he's picked up is to add an expositional paragraph before an action sequence, wrecking the suspense by telling the reader what's going to happen.<br />For the most part, characters are strong, vivid and well drawn. I particularly appreciate Needle's ability to create female characters who, while believable for the period, are individuals.<br />The plot, while exciting, doesn't have the gripping quality of the first book in the series. I think the author tries to do too much. Perhaps focusing on either the press or the smuggling, with the dental horrors as a subplot, would have been stronger. More detail on either of those would have been appreciated. As it is, there are fascinating themes here, but I felt the lack of a dramatic climax, and there are times when the plot bogs down. Readers should be warned that some of the teeth scenes are beyond disgusting.<br />The finale is ambiguous, leaving the door open for, I hope, a third installment.	2002-04-05

Anyone who's read the author's other work will know that his novels are a progression of character deaths, often pointless and cruel. This one was even more depressing than that.<br />Use of language in this book is generally evocative, but occasionally, particularly in the section from Doobie's perspective, becomes downright simple-minded and annoying. There are a lot of repeated phrases.<br />Characterization is excellent, sort of. The reader gets to know the characters. The reader gets to care about the characters. Then the characters mostly die, or worse. It's a bummer.<br />The plot involves a manhunt for various different brutal outlaws. It's about the end of Captain Call's career, and the ongoing story of Pea Eye and Lorena, now married with a large family. Secondary characters include the return of Mox Mox, the various men involved in Call's manhunt, the outlaw Garza's downtrodden yet plucky mother Maria, and fictionalized versions of John Wesley Hardin and Charles Goodnight. Mostly it's exciting and fast-moving, but there are some annoying tangents -- Maria running off to deliver a baby right at a climactic moment especially frustrated me.<br />One unbelievable element of the plot was the amateur amputations and terrible wounds suffered by the characters -- without cauterization, ligature, tourniquets, or anything else. Realistically, the amputee in particular should have bled to death in minutes.<br />The end, however, I did not enjoy. The whole thing with the little blind girl was sentimental and frankly creepy. The main character's downfall seemed like an act of pointless cruelty on the author's fault -- I wondered if it was meant to be fate, some kind of karmic punishment for deeds done (or more, not done) in earlier volumes. I still didn't enjoy reading it.<br />The title, taken from a sad traditional ballad about a dying cowboy, seems appropriate here.

This book doesn't stand alone; one has to have read the previous several volumes to get the most out of it.<br />I've always regretted that Perry doesn't challenge her characters more, or involve them in physical action. Here she does so -- still not as much as would make for a *really* exciting book, but it's an improvement. Pitt's career is in danger, and Tellman actually gets a fight scene to his credit.<br />Characterization progresses here -- the characters' relationships with one another deepen and become more meaningful.

Writing is stark and spare, occasionally quite evocative. Characterization is quite good; Gus and Call are appealing and believable, and for the most part the secondary characters have the vivid qualities one comes to expect from this author.<br />The plot, that of an improbable filibustering expedition to New Mexico (then part of Mexico proper), has some issues. It seems as if this group of characters has been sent out into the desert merely to die in a myriad unpleasant ways; I'm all for grim stories, but this gets pointless. At about the point where most of the expedition has frozen to death or been killed by Indians, and they're STILL not to the hardest part of the journey yet... I got a little bored with the entropic, meaningless feel of the whole thing. There's also a wildly improbable end: the whole sequence with Lady Carey seems utterly unbelievable to me, although the scene where she buffaloes the Indians is great.<br />McMurtry's presentation of the Indians as torturing, raping, slave-hunting savages took me aback. I don't know enough to say whether his portrayal of these specific types of raiding bands, from these specific Native American societies, is accurate. It's certainly a different picture than one gets from books like Dee Brown's.<br />I'd recommend this with reservations; generally entertaining, but not without faults.	2002-03-28

It's good to see a writer who actually improves as he goes along.<br />Indicative of this improvement is the amount of historical detail given in this book, the second in the Brethren of the Coast series. Largely about the slave trade, The Blackbirder reveals the depth of the author's research into African cultures of the period.<br />Ex-pirate Marlowe should by rights be a fascinating character, but he lacks depth -- not merely because he's a rather shallow person, which he is, but because Nelson hasn't developed him sufficiently. He has a certain blank quality. James, the other main character here, is better drawn, but still not quite exemplary. Secondary characters, such as Marlowe's wife and her rakish ally Billy, aren't bad, but aren't fantastic either -- I'd say overall that characterization is a bit of a weakness here, though not disastrously so.<br />The plot, as one expects with Nelson, is an exciting one -- I don't find the themes here as interesting as his battles-at-sea books, but other readers may well prefer them. I did find my suspension of disbelief faltering at one point, when a psychotic racist tries to imprison Marlowe's freed workers: either they're free, and he would have to have a warrant, or they're slaves, and he's stealing property, and either way, that element didn't quite work for me. Overall, though, the story is fast-paced, enjoyable and holds the reader's attention well.	2002-03-27

Guerrant	Books	2	9	11	N	N	Bluegrass Confederate	Though not devoid of some human interest value, this is not an especially useful source for the historian. Guerrant saw little action, and writes scantily about what he did see. I can't imagine that most of his sojourns in West Virginia and Kentucky will be of interest to most scholars; there is an account of the Battle of Saltville, but that's about it. Eloquent, not to say melodramatic, jeremiads on the weather make up a good deal of the text.<br />On the other hand, Guerrant was the kind of diarist who thinks that posterity may read his diary someday, and he writes with verve and emotion -- multiple exclamation points, parenthetical clever remarks, and so on. After hundreds of pages -- for a Civil War diary this is exceedingly long -- that gets old, but he undeniably has his moments.	2002-03-21

I am not such a reader.<br />Morgan's Run is the story of Richard Morgan, who begins his career in Bristol, ends up in prison, and is sent on a ship to help found a convict colony on an island off Australia. I read the book partly because of the claims of one professional reviewer that the book was largely about gunsmithing, the Brown Bess musket (and, I was hoping, associated tactics). It's not. The Brown Bess passage is merely one of the author's numerous info-dumps. Others involve topics, like saw-pits and sharpening sawteeth, less than fascinating to me.<br />Characterization is a strength here, and helps to offset the book's slowness. Morgan is an appealing character, as is his friend Stephen Donovan. Secondary characters are also well drawn, though sometimes they get lost in the epic shuffle. The author portrays several nontraditional romantic relationships, which is nice to see in a genre that often ignores their existence; the portrayals, however, are not entirely free of stereotype. Women do not fare so well here, with even the eventual main love interest being drawn as rather stupid, and characters often express sentiments that seem misogynistic even for the 18th century.<br />The plot is the main weakness here, because despite its intrinsic interest, it moves very slowly and incorporates little action. The section on the Alexander, the ship transporting the convicts to Australia, is by far the strongest.<br />Setting is excellent in that the author has obviously done her research and has a firm grasp of her subject, but it intrudes via the aforementioned lumps of exposition.<br />Language use is generally graceful, though with an anachronism here and there and the occasional authorial intrusion.<br />I think this book will appeal to readers who enjoy this specific type of historical fiction. Persons needing action, crisis and drama in their novels may want to give it a miss.	2002-03-21

Over and over he builds up tension, leads up to an action scene, only to painfully disappoint the reader by skipping to when it's all over. Even at the end, which contains an undeniably moving fight scene, he seems to have a certain distaste for the action, and description is lacking.

Rejoining his regiment, he finds them in the grip of an incompetent, vicious commander, Towcester. Through battles with Luddites and a trip to America, he must deal with Towcester's spite. Meanwhile, he marries Henrietta, and she follows him to America, with tragic results. Though the plot device of the malevolent officer is hardly new, it's a good one. But, as I said above, it isn't as well handled as it could be. The potential drama very much gets lost. The end of the book, which is dramatic, feels as if it should have come as the climax, halfway through.<br />Appealing characters, especially secondary characters, and a dramatic conclusion can't quite save this book.

Occasional anachronisms (\\"okay\\") show up, and the editors have failed to fix some minor spelling errors. There's a certain lack of visual description of characters: some of them seem faceless to me.<br />This is the first installment in the story of Isaac Biddlecomb, an appealing character, undecided as to whether he wants to support the growing movement for American independence, or not. Biddlecomb is very human, sufficiently heroic, yet quite believable. Most of the secondary characters here are also quite well drawn.<br />The plot is nonstop, although, as I read through the series, I'm beginning to think Nelson needs to come up with some other plot device than having ships at sea collide. (It's very exciting, but after the third or fourth time, that's enough. He's starting to wear out the welcome of mutinies, too.) My interest was engaged throughout, from the intense opening scenes through the ambiguous, clearly sequel-awaiting end.<br />Nelson writes incompetents well. His scenes of fools who don't know what they're doing add a touch of originality and humor to the series. Also, he escapes the \\"good guys, bad guys\\" trap; most of his characters have ambiguities and depths. <br />I'd compare these in literary quality to Bernard Cornwell's books: seemingly well researched and certainly gripping reconstructions, enjoyable and fast, not High Literature but certainly of interest to anyone who reads historical fiction. It's worth mentioning that this series -- not a trilogy, as there are five so far, and the ending left the door very much open for more -- gets better as it goes along, with plots increasing in complexity and improved editing. The characterization of Smeaton, in the fifth volume, is especially worthy of note. \\"Light\\" they may be, but I enjoyed these books quite a bit.	2002-03-18

It's the story of Shay, who travels with his mother, uncle, and assorted other relatives and followers from Missouri to the West as part of his mother's attempt to locate her long-gone husband.<br />The book has some of McMurtry's strengths: the humor, the clear, spare writing style, the appealing working-class characters (including the mules). But the plot is shallow, the characters are never really developed, and the end sudden. Overall, the book feels as if the author were just going through the motions; as if he were bored with the work. Mary Margaret and Seth, particularly, might have been interesting people, but the reader never gets to know them. I'd skip this in favor of McMurtry's more carefully written work.	2002-03-15

Good ideas and interesting characters were undercut by wordiness, lack of attention to detail, and continuity errors.<br />Kingdom of Cages is the story of the planet Pandora. Inhabited by people who believe that the planet's ecosystem should be protected at all costs, it is threatened when a plague (never well defined) strikes all other human-inhabited worlds (barring the long since paved-over Earth). The book involves the points of view of Pandora's defenders; the people who want to settle the planet as their last hope of survival; and the Trust family, whose somehow special DNA makes them valuable experimental subjects for Pandora's rulers, who are hoping to cure the plague before they are forced to let colonists destroy their environment.<br />It's not really worth listing all the things that didn't make sense in the book. Among the most disappointing to me was the Pandoran ecology: just like Earth's, with deer, bears, birds, blackberries and so on. While the author does establish that Pandora's likeness to Earth is a deliberate device, I find alien ecologies among SF's most fascinating themes. So I was disappointed. The ecologically protective actions of the Pandorans also do not make sense. They're not allowed to have aspirin -- though there are willow trees, the bark of which contains salicylic acid, on the planet -- but bread mold penicillin is somehow OK. They can't change the ecosystem at all -- but there are scenes of people fishing. And so on.<br />Important plot elements -- the diversity plague, the Pandorans' love for their planet -- are never made strong and vital enough. Instead, the book fades off into wordy tangents.<br />Characters here are attractive, though I was mystified as to Chena's sudden, unheralded descent into apparent madness -- after which she seems to just shake her head and return to normal. There were too many characters and points of view, but Chena and Teal in particular were well-drawn and vivid.<br />Various ideas and images here caught my interest, but the overall package seemed to lack detail and coherence.	2002-03-15

This book was almost *too* intense for me -- and I mean that as a compliment. It's the story of an unhappy ship, a psychotic captain (I kept seeing Anthony Hopkins as Captain Bligh, reading Swift's scenes), and the inevitable results. Characters die -- *major* characters die. Don't read this if you lack a strong stomach.<br />Needle's writing is a blunt, brutally wielded instrument, but gets the job done. The choreography of action scenes can sometimes be a little too static; overall setting and description, though, stand out. His dialogue sometimes rings false, but works adequately. Characterization is strong overall, though with some events (Allgood's collapse; Bentley's change of heart) never quite ringing true. The plot never stops moving from the first page to the last; I was never bored, and I bore easily.<br />Of interest to me is Needle's purpose in writing this book, apparently the first in the series. The title character, Bentley, is not an admirable figure here. But presumably he is going to be the protagonist of books to come. Many authors give their characters dark pasts, but reveal them only in snatches of backstory; Needle here has written that dark past out in all its sordid glory. I am certainly looking forward to seeing what the author does next.	2002-03-13

It has literary qualities, and parts are excellent. But the author tries to do too much.<br />Had McCaig confined himself to his soldiers, perhaps emphasizing the comparison and contrast between his desperate Confederates and his well-fed but disrespected USCT, the book would have had more focus and impact. He writes battle scenes very well. But he gets sidetracked into endless subplots, most of which I found boring and long-winded. The &quot;framing&quot; device of the girl collecting interviews seems particularly irrelevant, but the domestic scenes, in general, drag.<br />McCaig does well at writing from both white and African-American viewpoints without stereotyping or dehumanizing either group; his characters remain individual human beings.<br />I found only small and fairly irrelevant errors here, though McCaig takes some minor liberties with the Battle of Fredericksburg.	2002-03-12

In Reverse of the Medal, Aubrey's financial innocence leads him into a trap. When he points out that he wouldn't have known *how* to commit stock market-related corruption, let alone have wanted to do it -- I think any modern reader ever plagued by stocks, taxes, and/or abusive collection agents can sympathize.<br />So, also, may readers in this age of downsizing and demotions sympathize with the humiliating and painful experiences which follow. I won't post a spoiler for the pillory scene, but it's powerful. I cried.<br />O'Brian's other strengths of historical verisimilitude, dialogue, and setting all are in evidence as well in this, one of the series' high points.	2002-03-12

Unknown to the people around him, he has a sinister past. When he's put in command of the ship intended to protect the colonists and their shipping from pirates, his past comes back to haunt him.<br />The book starts a little slowly, but gains momentum fast; the plot is an exciting one with plenty to hold the reader's interest. There's nothing artistic about the writing style, but in places it is quite vivid. While the characters could have been better drawn, they were adequate, and I found myself caring about their fates. Setting is a weakness, though; one gets little idea of what the Chesapeake Bay landscapes and seascapes look like, nor does Nelson incorporate the kind of small, fascinating details of daily life, weaponry, and so on that really first-class historical fiction authors do. However, he's very good at pirates. His pirates are truly scary, and the pirates' leader, LeRois, is perhaps the best-characterized person in the book.<br />I recommend this as a reasonably undemanding but entertaining book, comparable, in terms of plot and action, to some of Cornwell's work.	2002-03-11

The battle scene is one of the longest I've ever read, and every word is worth it.<br />Pre-battle, the book is enjoyable, though marred with a continuity error here and there. Sharpe needs to get home from India. The ship he's on gets taken by the French (in circumstances I didn't find absolutely believable, but let that be), and he ends up on a man-of-war. Of course, as in every Sharpe book, he ends up in a love affair. It's about as believable as they always are. Some of the secondary characters, particularly Captain Chase and the merchant Fairley, stand out.<br />The battle is wonderful, appalling, graphic, gory, exhausting, vivid and terrifying. No, Cornwell's no Shakespeare (and he's no O'Brian, either) but he writes a mean battle scene, and this is one of his best. As a non-specialist in the period, I didn't find many errors; and, again as a non-specialist, I found his characterization of Nelson especially vivid. <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the period and in non-stop, no-holds-barred battle scenes.	2002-03-07

I wonder how authentic that is. I found no obvious errors, except that, in keeping with the rest of Perry's books, the women seem very independent for the period.<br />Perry has come up with what must be one of the best characterization hooks ever invented. William Monk suffers from amnesia. He has reason to think he was an unpleasant person, a person capable of wronging others, in the past. But... he can never know what, exactly, he did. I would have liked to see a few more original touches in his *current* character, but it's still a fascinating idea.<br />The plot of Cain his Brother is outstanding. A minor consistency error here and there does not detract from its drama. A man has murdered his twin brother -- or has he? I thought I had the secret figured out several times, but I was wrong. But when the answer was revealed, it made perfect sense. Perry sometimes has surprise twists out of nowhere at the end of her books, but this time she got it exactly right. I remained unclear on one thing --Ravenstone's motivation -- but that may be my oversight.<br />This is a very entertaining historical mystery which I strongly recommend.	2002-03-07

This book... <br />The writing is pedestrian. Boring words outnumber vivid ones by a *lot*.<br />The setting is that of the reign of Henry and Eleanor, with an emphasis on conflicts with Owain Gwynedd. Again, it's not vivid. I can't smell it, can't taste it. It just... lies there. And it's flawed by a severe historical error. Penman seems unaware that medieval people thought differently than we do today about life; about marriage, children, family, duty, identity, and all sorts of things. Her characters all act and talk like modern people, and people who've read a lot of self-help books, at that. It's obvious that none of her research has involved Duby, LeGoff, or any of their colleagues.<br />As for the plot, it's painfully slow to get started. Henry and Eleanor make love; Becket hangs around being suave; there are some vague rumblings of action in the Marches; Henry argues with churchmen. As a reader, I need to be drawn in quickly. I need a reason to continue with the book. I didn't find that here.<br />I recommend avoiding this.	2002-03-07

His vivid imagery and stark, eloquent language breathe life into this book and make it outstanding. Readers who enjoy Cormac McCarthy's books will find this to be similar in many of its good qualities.<br />In the Rogue Blood is the story of two brothers in the 1840's. They travel West and get mixed up in the Mexican War; one ends up fighting for Mexico in the San Patricios, while the other joins a band of Mexican scouts fighting for the United States. The end, as one might expect from Blake, is not a happy one.<br />It's a tribute to Blake's writing that I was able to enjoy the book despite his characters. They're walking lizard brains, constantly sleeping with whores and getting in pointless fights. However period they may be, they're not very interesting people. The plot bogs down in the middle, when the characters seem to be meaninglessly repeating their brutal behavior ad nauseam, but picks up when they become involved in the war. Female characters here exist primarily for the use of men, though one could argue that part of the tragedy of John and Edward is that they are never capable of comprehending their wild mother and sister.<br />Much of 1840's America as presented by Blake seems accurate to me, though his version is certainly a very bleak one, sometimes melodramatically so. This is an ugly West, full of cruelty and deformity, with malice towards all, and sometimes the sheer ugliness of everything taxed my suspension of disbelief.<br />Nevertheless, this is a powerful tragedy and a brilliantly styled book, which I strongly recommend.	2002-02-11

Unfortunately, the author's writing style, particularly his very strange sense of drama and timing, dilute the impact considerably.<br />Privateersman is set just before the American Revolution. A Liverpool shipowner, Captain Kite, discovers that his business partner has been cheating him. Simultaneously, he loses his wife and son to cholera. He reestablishes his business on the far side of the Atlantic, finds (rather quickly and easily) new love, and becomes involved in a conflict with high-handed colonial rebels who commandeer one of his ships. I found it interesting that the colonists are the \\"bad guys\\"; this is a fresh new viewpoint, and as such creates interest.<br />The time period, the unusual merchant shipping (rather than naval) setting and the plot line here all promise interest. However, Woodman's timing is off. Dramatic events pass by with little fanfare -- but purple prose sneaks in at other moments. Few of the characters seem more than one-dimensional. Part of the problem is the exposition-heavy nature of the text, which tells much more than it shows. Excellent moments such as Tyrell's death and the taking of the Wentworth aren't enough to save this novel, which, in the final analysis, is rather boring.	2002-02-08

Or perhaps it's a very bad one. I felt mystified by it, but, on balance, I'm leaning toward \\"bad\\".<br />Lambdin appears to be a stylistic and grammatical \\"wolf-child\\". He breaks every rule with apparent innocence. Literally ungrammatical sentences wander, going nowhere. Exclamation points pepper the text. Dialogue is phrased in spelled-out dialect, occasionally vivid but far more often twee. Anything that can possibly be seen as jargon gets capitalized and hyphenated in the best tradition of bad military fiction.<br />Characterization here seems shallow. Alan Lewrie, the hero, is presented as \\"different\\": a sort of a renegade womanizing rogue-cop kind of guy. Really, though, he comes across as a rather shallow individual. The constant locker-room banter between the characters seems highly improbable for the late 18th century setting, and while the promiscuity of all characters may be period, at least for the men, the coldness with which they pursue it is off-putting. Even more off-putting is the fact that no female character here is more than a bit of fluff, of significance only for her attractiveness to men.<br />The setting, the Balkan Adriatic and Venice, is fascinating. The plot seems exciting, but upon reflection, represents a rather obvious attempt to be timely. Trying to raid French shipping, Lewrie and the squadron he's part of enlist the help of Serbian pirates. The pirates proceed to establish a death camp and begin torturing and killing their enemies. The parallel to recent Balkan events is heavy-handed, and the Serbs are presented as rather subhuman. There are enjoyable moments in the plot, such as when the Hungarian aide whom Lewrie has dismissed as effeminate turns out to be a fantastic swordsman, but overall, I'd give this a miss.	2002-02-06

In this one, however, the plot doesn't quite hang together in several respects. Why would anybody believe in a suicide note written not in handwriting but pasted from newspaper, like the blackmail letters prominent citizens have been getting? And why was it necessary for the dead man found on a doorstep with a snuffbox in his pocket to look like another man? The conclusion comes rather suddenly and considerably out of left field -- the author hasn't done a good job of foreshadowing the end.<br />As already suggested, this volume is about blackmail, with both old and new characters receiving notes threatening to spread irrefutable falsehoods about their pasts. This was an interesting theme, which could have been more deeply explored.<br />Yet again, unrequited love plays a part here. For some reason, people in these books are perpetually falling for people they can't have. I'm not sure it's realistic for it to happen so often, but in the context of one book it's perfectly fine.<br />Sergeant Tellman, with the chip on his shoulder, gets more development here and becomes a really appealing character.<br />Despite my quibbles with the plot, I found the book essentially enjoyable.	2002-02-06

But it quickly becomes a sort of cut-rate, bad comic book cross between Stephen King's The Stand and Sean Stewart's Galveston. Something happens -- we don't get the intellectual satisfaction of learning exactly what -- in a top secret government research facility. Technology stops working, and some people metamorphose. Two foci of presumably destructive power appear -- a rather confusing plot point -- and our questing band of heroes must tackle the first one. <br />There are too many characters for the modest length of the book, and most are not well drawn. The cliched imagery verges on the ridiculous. It really is a comic book -- one person appears to be changing into Catwoman. The plot is fast-moving but shallow and unbelievable. While the basic idea is an interesting one, the book never gets off the ground. It comes across as imitative, lacking themes of its own.	2002-02-06

It has far more life, verve and wit than that book.<br />The setting, the British bombardment of Copenhagen, is interesting, though I had a little trouble believing that all the Danes were really nineteenth-century versions of born-again Christians. Sharpe, mourning for Grace, is actually behaving as though he has some normal human emotions, though he spoils that effect somewhat by forming a rapid and unbelievable attachment to a beautiful (of course) Danish woman. The battle and fight scenes are fast-moving and exciting, as we've come to expect from Cornwell. Sergeant Harper, who hasn't met Sharpe yet in this installment, gets a brief cameo.<br />The plot is excellent till about 2/3 of the way through, and then improbabilities and gaps creep in; it all winds up in a slightly confused and somewhat too easy fashion. Had the conclusion maintained the level of quality of the first part, I would have given the book a 4. As it is, despite its plot problems, I found Sharpe's Prey to be an entertaining read.	2002-01-30

Rhea writes the sort of book which tells readers where every regiment was at every moment, which is precisely what I find helpful. His maps are clear and he uses plenty of quotes from primary sources, which gives the text excitement and human interest. The book focuses equally on Confederate and Union experiences.<br />What I found a little strange about this book was Rhea's desire to evaluate the performance of each unit, general and army overall -- not simply in terms of analysis but in terms of making statements as to their quality -- statements to the effect of &quot;Lee made three mistakes here&quot; and &quot;None of Grant's corps commanders performed well on that day&quot;. These are bold statements to make, and perhaps an overweening position of judgment for an author who was not present at the battle to take. <br />This will be a vital text for anyone studying the battle, though as the Wilderness was part of continuous action and Rhea stops before getting to Spotsylvania, it would need to be combined with other works.	2002-01-17

It's also quite a psychodrama; at times it reminds me of Elizabeth George's work, as one ends up trapped in a room with a number of vocally unpleasant people. A difficult young woman has died, and nearly everyone in the house at the time had some reason to dislike her. Meanwhile, because the primary suspect is a clergyman, the local bishop puts pressure on the police to hush the matter up. The conclusion is clever, neither out-of-left-field nor obvious until the very end.<br />My essential problem with this book was the anachronistic beliefs and thought patterns its characters revealed. The dead woman, Unity Bellwood, is a feminist, and that's not at all anachronistic; the book is set during a period of agitation for female suffrage. But the way she and her friends express themselves is very much in terms of personal development, of being allowed to &quot;be themselves&quot;. Those are very late-20th-century concepts. In addition, when the curate Dominic talks to grieving or troubled people, he may as well be quoting from a modern self-help book; his lines don't have a nineteenth-century ring at all.<br />Most readers probably will not notice the anachronisms, and despite a certain lack of physical action common to many of Perry's books, this is a generally entertaining novel.	2002-01-16

This review is of 13.<br />I felt this was one of the weakest volumes of this anthology yet.<br />I read these as much for the introduction, giving the \\"state of the industry\\" and recommending books, as for the stories. I was disappointed therefore that that section in this volume was very short and few books were mentioned. I've read some of the recommended books and found them to be of low quality, making me wonder if the editors had really read them. On the other hand, though I haven't checked publication dates, I'm pretty sure some good work came out in 2000 that was not mentioned.<br />On to the stories: The editors of this series consistently make an effort to scour the globe for the \\"best\\" fantasy and horror stories. I rarely like their more exotic findings, since literature in translation (not to mention kooky magic realism without plot) tends not to work for me. This edition seemed to have more translated and out-of-left-field stories than others, which weakened it for me. Overall, the quality of the stories seemed rather low, particularly in the area of horror, though there was one nice story about a haunted house.<br />Standouts here are Gilman's incomprehensible but gorgeously poetic folktale story and a wonderful novella by John Crowley based on a selkie ballad. Nalo Hopkinson's story, despite a rather unsupported character twist, also is worth reading.	2002-01-15

Once again we have a strange, semi-omniscient narrator, this time the Virgin Mary (it works a lot better than it sounds like it would), and once again spies and agents vie against each other in plots and counterplots. <br />Unicorn's Blood contains some wonderful characterization, with Finney proving utterly unafraid to push her characters, particularly Becket, to their limits. Female characters here are strong without becoming anachronistic. The rapid, multifaceted plot becomes coincidental at times, but never lost my interest. Elizabethan purists may be offended by the strong, but unvirginal, portrayal of the Queen. Point of view is strange, with Mary used as a device for omniscience just as Mad Tom was in the first book, but not so much so as to detract from my enjoyment.<br />Fans of the Robert Carey series will be happy to see that he performs heroically here, along with some briefly-on-stage but appealing Border henchmen.	2002-01-14

As his character Sir John Fielding says, he likes to pull rabbits out of hats. Readers who like this kind of mystery will probably enjoy this book, while those who like their stories more down-and-dirty may not.<br />The Color of Death is better paced, plotted and characterized than some of the other books in the series, though emotional melodramas (Annie and Burnham) seem to come and go rather quickly, leaving not a wrack behind. Robbers, perhaps of African descent or perhaps in blackface, have been cleaning out local rich folks' houses and committing murders, and Jeremy and Sir John, with their associates, must solve the crimes. This gives Alexander an opportunity to bring in themes of racial prejudice, and his characters (at least the good guys) seem to be much less prejudiced than one would expect from persons of their time and place. There are many interesting moments here -- the troubled domestic relationship of Mr. and Mrs. Trezavant is one -- but in general they are not deeply explored.<br />Overall, this is a readable, more or less entertaining, but rather shallow book.	2002-01-14

It contains some amazingly clumsy prose, and much of what isn't outright dreadful is pedestrian. The maladroitness of the writing got in the way of the story for me. Cornwell has never been a fantastic stylist, but this is ridiculous.<br />Characterization is another weakness here. Strangely, secondary characters, such as the hysterical Frenchwoman Jeanette and the cynical Jewish doctor Mordecai, are stronger than the main character, the emotionless archer Thomas of Hookton. His father has been slaughtered, along with most of his village, by French raiders? Hookton shrugs, half-heartedly vows vengeance, and becomes an archer. A boyhood lover dies, possibly while giving birth to Thomas' own child? Shrug. And so on. Thomas is one of Cornwell's super-good-at-war characters, like Sharpe, but his lack of normal human reactions makes him impossible to sympathize with. I suppose the intent is to create a gritty, &quot;life is cheap&quot; tone, but I don't find it believable.<br />Despite these problems, The Archer's Tale moves along quickly with an exciting plot. There's plenty of fighting, and lots of attention to the longbow, as one would expect. It's not a deep or especially scholarly portrayal of medieval life as a whole, but I didn't find anything glaringly wrong. The book concludes with a retelling of the Battle of Crecy which is worth reading.	2002-01-09

But, due to a letter from Carey's father, they've had to ride south to London. Readers be encouraged: this is no Renaissance Faire.<br />Characterization is particularly strong in this volume because it's from the point of view of Sergeant Dodd, the tough, morose, thoroughly engaging Borderer. His viewpoints on London, the aristocracy, and Carey are not only humorous but have a certain ring of truth. I'd always liked Dodd, but in the course of this book he became one of my favorite historical fiction characters of all time. Carey, seen through Dodd's eyes, retains his notable charm and savoir-faire. And Chisholm does something nearly impossible: writes about real historical characters and does it well. Yes, Shakespeare is in this book, and yes, it works.<br />The plot is an exciting one, of course. Some of the twists aren't quite as well developed as they could be, but between the plague, the Fleet Prison, and our hero facing torture by the bad guys, it's hard to care.<br />I was particularly impressed here with Chisholm's presentation of Renaissance mentalities. The pure terror evoked by the plague, in an age when diseases were unstoppable and more or less uncurable, is very well described. It's also worth mentioning that, although her protagonists are male, Chisholm does well with female characters, making them realistic products of their time but still strong, interesting individuals.	2002-01-09

Jack, Knave and Fool is talky and forgettable, with much of the action and drama happening offstage. The characters change little and never seem personally challenged. Jeremy's &quot;voice&quot; has developed somewhat, but that's not enough to save this honestly rather boring book. Strange pseudo-archaisms on the order of &quot;Nicely dressed she was&quot; add an annoying touch.	2002-01-08

Chisholm writes in a spare style which successfully infuses both humor and drama into the story. The characters, particularly the secondary characters, are endlessly appealing and the pacing of the plot is high-tension and breakneck. The hard-luck Border setting adds interest.<br />Season of Knives starts only days after the end of A Famine of Horses, the first book. Carey is trying to seduce the married Lady Elisabeth. Everyone in the area is struggling to get their hay harvest in -- except for Carey's enemies, who plan a raid to kidnap the Lady. Meanwhile, a local man is killed, and the list of possible culprits grows. There are some especially wonderful scenes here -- one in which corrupt rations dealers are offered their own wares is almost worth the price of the book by itself. There's plenty of fast-moving action and a bittersweet end. Here and there plausibility falters (would a woman theoretically outraged enough to cut her husband's throat really hesitate because it would mean washing all the sheets?) but overall this book sets a very high standard.	2002-01-04

Unfortunately, this novel disappointed.<br />The lengthily titled Through a Brazen Mirror: The Famous Flower of Servingmen is based on a ballad, and as such should have had a workable plot. Essentially, a sorceress is trying to kill her daughter because of a prophecy that the daughter will be her death, but she can't kill her directly because of the rules of magic. In her efforts to kill the daughter indirectly, she kills the daughter's family. The daughter dresses as a man and goes to join the king's household, where she rises to a high position. The king falls in love with him/her, of course. I found this basically solid plot to be expressed very slowly and without tension. Character motivations never really seemed strong. The essential tragedy of the story, the fact that the young king is in love with the man he thinks the daughter is, only comes in at the very end and isn't adequately supported throughout the novel. Margaret, the morally ambivalent sorceress, never convinced me somehow. <br />The novel is written in a self-consciously Renaissance style that sounds as if the author had worked RenFaire several too many times. It is fluent and correct, but to me it comes across as a little precious.<br />There's some originality here and some appealing scenes, but overall, I didn't find it to be something I would recommend.	2002-01-03

It covers the start of the war through the ship-burnings at Norfolk. I really would give it a &quot;four and a half&quot;; it would get a five if not for the sections involving Araminta, which I found much less convincing than the rest.<br />Poyer is one of the only &quot;military fiction&quot; authors who knows how to string words together. He writes evocatively, even artistically. His descriptions of ships and battles are particularly good. Setting is excellent, with a few anachronistic moments overshadowed by the wonderful description, both technical and sensory, of Civil War-era steam/sail warships. <br />The characters here are appealingly tormented, particularly Eli, whose affliction with consumption is a very nice touch. Ker Claiborne, who must decide whether or not to join his seceding state, and the ahead-of-his-time young engineer Theo, are appealing as well. Less believable is Eli's ex-fiancee Araminta, who seems a little anachronistic in her independence and is certainly a bit annoying, though probably &quot;period&quot;, in her do-gooder tendencies. I did find some of the dialogue, especially &quot;dialect&quot; dialogue, to sound a bit too British.<br />The plot is very exciting, with huge amounts of action. Occasionally the part of the plot dealing with family relationships gets a little melodramatic, not to say purple.<br />I think this is an absolutely wonderful book which not only helps to fill a gap in Civil War literature but which, because of its good writing, will appeal to readers not normally interested in the period.	2002-01-02

One does not have to read the second book (I hadn't) to understand the events.<br />Alexander's writing and plotting have improved and become more ambitious in the interim. Watery Grave involves a murder (perhaps) committed on board a ship during a storm; the subsequent investigation turns up a rat's nest of corruption and pits land- and sea-based legal jurisdictions against one another. We also learn how Fielding lost his sight. I wanted to see more of what happened on the ship, and I felt that the end of the novel was quite disappointing. What should be devastating courtroom scenes are skipped over, given little impact, and largely told rather than shown. Careful readers will also find at least one minor continuity error. Nevertheless, this is an entertaining book featuring some interesting characters, particularly the perceptive Fielding.<br />After having written this review I noted that another reviewer thought there were historical errors. I don't know enough about the period to judge whether that's correct or not, but if so it should be counted as a serious flaw in the book.	2001-12-31

The author certainly broke no taboos, and kept close to traditional, even sometimes hackneyed, mystery genre conventions. Nevertheless, it was readable and introduced interesting characters.<br />Alexander writes well, unremarkably, in a manner which calls no stylistic attention to itself. His setting, though not exactly untrodden in fiction, comes agreeably to life. <br />In Blind Justice, the young orphan Jeremy Proctor comes to London after his father's tragic death in the pillory, and becomes a protege of the blind magistrate Sir John Fielding (based on a historical personage). Fielding is certainly an original and appealing character, and the author never forgets to work his blindness realistically into the story. Proctor becomes involved in helping Fielding solve the murder of one Lord Goodhope. The plot moves along pretty well, though there's a hackneyed &quot;drawing-room&quot; scene at the end. I like my historical fiction a little grittier than this somewhat &quot;nice&quot; portrayal, and Alexander has an unfortunate tendency to tell rather than show.<br />I found this reasonably entertaining and it's worth noting that the third in the series, Watery Grave (I haven't yet read the second installment) is an improvement.	2001-12-31

Loan shark and blackmailer Weems is killed, and the inspector Pitt must track down the people listed in his papers -- including some members of high society and some members of his own police force. Meanwhile, his wife Charlotte is helping her pregnant sister Emily deal with the demands placed on a would-be MP's wife. And everyone -- Pitt's superior Drummond, and people both of society and not -- falls in love, though not necessarily with happy results.<br />Perry writes in a competent, though not artistic, way. Her characters seem believable as people, with one exception which I'll get to, but are not striking or outstanding. She is at her best with setting: the etiquette, fashion and stifling &quot;correctness&quot; of late Victorian society are well delineated here. The newness of a police force and its iffy social status form an interesting part of Perry's world.<br />I found the plot to terminate with a twist that had not been sufficiently foreshadowed. Instead of &quot;Oh, of course,&quot; it made me say &quot;Huh? Where'd that come from?&quot;. It is a good twist, but it needs some foundation. The characters involved need to show, at least in retrospect, better signs of their hidden relationship. Also, the means of Weem's death, which promised to be interesting, was never really explored.	2001-12-31

Readers of Barbara Hambly's work may well appreciate this.<br />Chisholm's differences from the standard run of historical mystery authors start with her (?) writing style, which is spare, and reminds me of that of Cecelia Holland. It is also not devoid of humor, and the dialogue crackles along. <br />The setting is wonderful: very different from the norm, but extremely lawless and full of potential pitfalls for the characters. As a nonspecialist in the Renaissance, I didn't find any particular historical errors, though some readers may be confused by the references to the two separate courts, the Scottish one of which was headed by the man who would soon become James I of England. The women are perhaps a little independent for the time period, but it seems plausible enough given the setting.<br />Characters here stand out. I particularly liked the lugubrious Sergeant Dodd and his fiery wife, but Robert Carey, perhaps the only man on the Border with a concept of impartial justice, is also appealing. Assorted hard cases and Border ruffians fill out an entertaining cast. Chisholm's names for characters are wonderful. <br />The plot is an exciting one, involving murder, horse theft, kingnapping schemes, and assorted brawls. Though the larger themes have a certain implausibility about them, and some of the elements could be better described, there's little real cause for complaint.	2001-12-31

It's also a very difficult read in terms of the plot; it's confusing; it rambles; and it probably could have stood some pruning. I recommend it anyway.<br />Gentle writes well. She uses language beautifully. Even when the plot had lost me, I still enjoyed the images she presents.<br />The setting is a sort of seventeenth -- maybe -- century European one, only with human-sized rats in charge of humans, and gods (Decans) over all. The gargoyles of the title are the Decans' bestial acolytes. Alchemical and architectural concepts, including illustrations from alchemical texts, give the world-building depth. There's no real discussion of how the rats got to be in charge, and little about rat society, which seems very human-like, but I didn't find that to be a major flaw. <br />Characters stand out in their refusal to be stereotyped as fantasy heroes. Casaubon, the large and personally unhygienic Lord Architect, is perhaps the best and I was happy to see that he &quot;gets the girl&quot; in the end -- the &quot;girl&quot; being the rather deadly scholar, sorceress and swordfighter White Crow. There are probably too many characters, over all, but I can't name one of them as being unentertaining.<br />The plot is utterly confusing. The world, at the will of one of the Decans, is going to end. The characters have to stop that from happening. Meanwhile, humans are rebelling against rats, humans are rebelling against Decans, rats are rebelling against Decans and rats are rebelling against their own monarchy. It's a wonderful chaos, and I became quite lost at various points. It's also true that the plot goes on for perhaps too long -- in particular the post-saving-the-world portion (though it included some lovely images). But the end is wonderful.<br />I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind being somewhat befuddled and wants to read original,gorgeously written fantasy.	2001-12-31

Musicant sometimes seems to spend more time making snide remarks and calling people names than he does analyzing his sources.<br />However, if one can get past the bias, this is a reasonably complete introduction to the Civil War at sea, and the text is well furnished with quotes, which adds excitement. Ironclads get most of the attention here, with the commerce raiders and, strangely, the Hunley, rather scanted.	2001-12-20

I enjoyed it a great deal. <br />Kushner uses language well and professionally, with very few infelicitous phrases and several lovely images. <br />I have mixed feelings about the setting. It's very strong, very detailed, and I like the idea of a &quot;Renaissance Europe&quot; which tolerates same-sex affairs -- which the author presents attractively and in a believable manner, though in keeping with the time period, women seem to have less freedom than men. At the same time, examined closely, there are some logical weaknesses. Why does this society have no monarch? It has an essentially post-feudal structure, and there are dukes and other nobles -- and you can't have dukes without kings to make them so. It was also a little hard to believe that any meaningful number of men would be willing to be swordsmen, given that many of the challenges seem to be to the death. Still, the setting has that &quot;REAL&quot; feeling, and that's what counts.<br />The characters are reasonably appealing and anything but tritely heroic -- the talented swordsman Richard, who we know will probably die by the sword himself in a matter of a few years; the disturbed young nobleman Alec; the appealingly scheming Ferris; the snotty, shallow Michael, who begins to learn his lesson as the story goes on. I found dialogue to be a definite strength here, except for occasional exchanges between the lovers Richard and Alec which came across as anachronistically &quot;femme&quot;.<br />The plot drags very slightly at times, but overall is an exciting one with plenty, as one would expect, of sword-fighting. The real story here, though, is one of political maneuvering, and it's well done, with a satisfying conclusion.<br />I would recommend Swordspoint to people who enjoy well-written historical fantasy and romantic, but not &quot;romance&quot;, novels.	2001-12-19

Gentle, here, portrays a fascinating world -- an alternative Protectorate England -- with filth and luxury, magic and hard-eyed politics, juxtaposed. I was disappointed at the shortness of the book therefore. There seems to be so much here -- and the author keeps so much to herself.<br />The characters are interesting, truly &quot;different&quot;, especially the large and less than hygienic Casaubon. The protagonist, the physician/sorceress/warrior White Crow is violent, conflicted and ultimately quite real. The mercenary Pollexfen has his moments, especially on the gallows. But other characters get short shrift. Both the Protector Olivia and Queen Carola could be far deeper than they are here. Toward the end of the book, I found White Crow's motivations unclear, to the point that I wasn't really sure what she intended to do.<br />Gentle writes well and has established that through a number of excellent books. She also pulls no punches. Architecture of Desire is cold and brutal, to be sure. It also contains some strange, dizzying POV shifts, and the indeterminacy of the conclusion bothered me. But the imagery is stark and stunning.<br />Another near-miss here concerns the plot. One plot line, that of a massive public structure which cannot, or should not, be built because the tainted royal blood used to sanctify its foundations has attracted demons -- is fascinating. I love the themes of architecture, cosmology and the human soul, and they fit the time period very well. But Gentle has chosen to focus on what for me is a less original and interesting plot, that of White Crow's and Pollexfen's dual rape of a woman named Desire and the choice White Crow must make when the mercenary ends up about to be hanged. As I've said, I found the end alarmingly unclear: is White Crow going back to Casaubon and their young children... or not?<br />I recommend this as a pill against milksop literature, but not without some reservations.	2001-12-18

Unfortunately, throughout the book, Hoare spoke. It would have been intriguing to see him resort to gestures and so on. Instead, the disability was basically ignored.<br />The rather nebulous plot involved some hard-to-believe-in Satanists and a threat to the British Navy which Hoare had to defuse with the help of an unseaworthy crew of intelligence agents and bluestockings. The plot seemed to wander, and though it was better paced than the first book in the series, it still lacked focus.<br />Perkins, in this book, essentially paid an homage to Patrick O'Brian -- mentioning one of his characters by name and repeating a joke (the one about the weevils). I trust that Perkins' editors took care of any legal issues there may have been. I was uncertain how I felt about this. On the one hand, I like homages and the sense that books by different authors somehow take place in the same world. On the other hand, I like it better when it's done less blatantly. <br />Overall I would say that this book, like the one preceding it, had some interesting points but did not attain a very high standard.	2001-12-14

The essential difference is the use of language -- nearly poetic here, plodding in the other book. Journey of the Dead is the combined story of Pat Garrett, the man who shot Billy the Kid, and of an old Spanish alchemist who lives as a hermit in the desert.<br />Estleman does a good, understated job of showing how Garrett is haunted by Billy's death throughout his life. The effect would have been stronger had their friendship been more extensively described. Still, the changing Billy the Kid legend provides an interesting way for Estleman to show changes in Garrett's life and in the West.<br />I found the plot to move a little slowly, probably because it concerns the life of a real person, more or less accurately reported as far as I know. Garrett tried many careers and had rather little success in any, according to Estleman, until he was finally murdered. This imposes a sort of flat quality on the plot. There are no big moments of drama, aside from Billy's death, and even that comes across as understated. Toward the end of the book, I got a trifle bored and wished for more tension and drama in the narrative.	2001-12-14

Hoare is a potentially intriguing character: nearly muted by a spent musket ball and constantly having to fight over insults to his surname, he could be something different. And the setting, early 19th century British aquatic, while hardly untrodden, is a good one. The female lead character is refreshingly robust in several senses.<br />However, this book reads like a rough draft. The plot is that of a mystery, and rather than letting the reader discover the characters and events for him/herself, Perkins lets everything out fast in a rush of exposition. Nothing here unfolds slowly. Scenes which should be dramatic, such as the explosion of a frigate, are so rushed that the reader feels deprived of the opportunity to participate. The author badly needs to learn to &quot;show&quot; rather than &quot;tell&quot;. The book has a slight, inconsequential feel, so despite occasional nice touches like Hoare's ship, which the hero gives a different name in every chapter, I cannot recommend it.	2001-12-11

There is essentially no plot structure. It's a melange of events, descriptive passages and polemic, narrated by the eponymous White-Jacket, whom I suspect of being Melville himself. At times the book is entertainingly humorous - as when the narrator tries to get rid of his famous jacket. And much of the description of life aboard a man-of-war is fascinating -- the book would make a helpful companion for people reading modern novels such as O'Brian's series. (And, of course, White-Jacket probably was one of the sources used by O'Brian and other aquatic novelists.) The polemic -- Melville's rants against flogging and his pacifist pleas -- I found tiresome, as I always find polemic, regardless of its aims.	2001-12-11

Le Guin introduces some new, appealing characters, and characters from the earlier books appear and continue their development. As in earlier books, the truly frightening land of the dead presents the problem here. It turns out that the progress of souls to this barren, walled place is not inevitable... but I don't want to spoil the story. Le Guin's use of images reminiscent of those of the dead in the Epic of Gilgamesh is chillingly well done. Of course, dragons, and their true identities, are also central to the plot.<br />If the book has a flaw, it's that the climax passes a little quickly. I could have done with more tension, a longer sequence of climactic events, more description of the resolution and, overall, a longer book. Overall, though, this is very well crafted and serves as a refreshing example of an elderly author who has utterly avoided the repetitiveness and loss of vision of Old Author Disease.	2001-12-06

I, unfortunately, couldn't manage to.<br />This is the story of Oscar Stone, professional hangman, from his Civil War experiences to nearly the turn of the century. I found the plot to be flat, lacking in climactic events and tension. Stone becomes a hangman, his wife leaves him, and then... well, he hangs people. The story is about how his profession changes him, and also about how the West changes during his lifespan. I found the plot dull, though, essentially because I couldn't get into Stone as a character. A psychiatrist would say he has a &quot;flat affect&quot;. He has little personality, little passion. The end of the story, which should be devastating, lacks impact because of the character's lack of apparent emotion about anything. Even when he searches for his wife, when he learns his son is dead, we never really get into Stone's head. Stone's wife is an utter cipher, even when she explains her motives.<br />The book is written in a spare, occasionally awkward style. Dialogue stands out, with Rudd, Stone's mentor, being particularly well done in this regard. A use of language which some reviewers have interpreted as stark and stylish came across to me as quite boring. I got very little sense of the sounds, smells and sights of the West -- with the exception of a wealth of detail on carpentry and hanging ropes.<br />Estleman does seem to have a good grasp of his period, with only a few minor errors (La Matte for LeMat) apparent. However, he tends to &quot;tell&quot; rather than &quot;show&quot; his historical information, enhancing the dry, dull feeling of the book.	2001-12-06

Books	3	3	4	N	N	Kydd	What I'd really like to do is give this novel a four for setting, a three for plot and use of language, and a three-minus for characterization. <br />Kydd is a first novel, and that shows. It has uneven quality, with the author heavily emphasizing bits he likes (details of the rigging) and skimming bits he doesn't care as much about (Kydd's pre-impressment life). It is very, very far from being the Second Coming of St. Patrick, despite the frothing of several professional reviewers. Yet it's readable, entertaining historical fiction.<br />Stockwin clearly knows his stuff when it comes to ships, and while some readers may enjoy the intensive detail given, others may get bogged down in it. I tended to enjoy it. Other aspects of the late 18th-century setting are not as well-drawn, but are competently portrayed. The episode in Brittany seemed weaker setting-wise than other parts of the novel.<br />The plot has an episodic quality, as others have noted, but I didn't find that excessive. There's plenty of action. There are a couple of minor continuity errors, but nothing fatal. I did feel, however, that Kydd gets away with his escapades too easily; problems are too readily solved. In particular, Kydd's ability to easily rendezvous with his ship after three different separations strained belief.<br />I found Kydd to be less than enticing as a character. He's sort of a Luke Skywalker, a hero in the making, and he's good at everything from shooting to climbing the rigging. Everyone he meets who's not a villain likes him. He's a little too flawless to be real, and a little too nice to be interesting. He's not a complex enough character to make me want to follow him through several books - compared to genre heroes Aubrey, Maturin or even Sharpe, he comes across as flat. However, Stockwin may well be able to enhance Kydd's depth of character in the upcoming sequel.<br />Though this isn't great literature, I enjoyed it, found it to be a quick, entertaining read, and will read the sequel when it comes out.	2001-12-05

I found the stories to be a very mixed bag. The standout in this volume is Le Guin's striking, unsentimental, Native American mythology-inspired &quot;Buffalo Gals, Won't You Come Out Tonight&quot;. Shephard's &quot;Delta Sly Honey&quot; was a beautifully written, evocative Vietnam War story, though it weakened toward the conclusion. &quot;Lake George in High August&quot; and &quot;The Maid on the Shore&quot; also stood out. Too many of the other stories, as in other volumes, are pedestrian, silly, or devoid of plot structure. I didn't find any of the poetry to be worthwhile. Overall, I'd give the stories mentioned a 4, but the others perhaps a 2. This uneven quality plagues every volume in this series.	2001-12-05

The mutants call themselves Wraeththu, and they are androgynes, resistant to disease and injury, long-lived, beautiful and psychically gifted. The Wraeththu are an attractive literary creation, well described and vivid.<br />The first book follows one Pellaz from his inception (mutation to Wraeththu) to his ascension to the throne of a powerful kingdom. The second picks up the story of Swift, one of the first generation born Wraeththu, and the third returns to Cal, Pellaz' lover in the first book, and brings the whole trilogy to a climax.<br />This is light, easy to read, soap-opera stuff. Constantine does not avoid 20th-century slang and colloquialism, which provides a nice counterpart to the sometimes overly lofty metaphysical themes. Since Wraeththu are very sexual creatures, there's a lot of sex, though it isn't graphically described. I generally found the characters appealing and the plots, though not very complex, interesting (though the very end of the third book gets silly). The novels overall do have a shallow quality: we meet characters and never see them again, the obvious gender issues are skipped over rather lightly, and the most interesting aspects of the world are never explored. But they're an easy, fast-moving read.	2001-11-29

I think some of the disappointment expressed by other reviewers was due to the transitional nature of DEFENDER. While important things happen, nothing really big does, and one wonders if fewer verbatim conversations and a bit of trimming -- along with perhaps a bit more drama focused on the primary external conflict, that with the pigheaded captain Sabin -- could have made this the first part of a novel including arrival and, one hopes, drama at the station. The author is capable of creating much more tension than appears in this book. It is not her best-developed work.    Having said that, the book is an entertaining read; Tabini's speech in the opening scenes is a masterpiece -- Tabini is an interesting figure, offstage most of the time but providing a striking example of utopian autocratic leadership. The main internal conflict, Bren's reaction to Tabini's having apparently bypassed him, is subtly and effectively written. I would like to see a bit more development in Bren's relationship with Jago -- nothing seems to change, and I'd at least like to see her reveal a bit more personality -- but there was hardly time in this volume. As usual, clear and elegant sentence-level writing, vivid images, interesting concepts and touches of humor abound.    Still looking forward to the arrival of Phoenix at Reunion.	2001-11-27

Much of the plot concerns Mildred and Elizabeth, how they meet their husbands (Mildred's, Brose, being Elizabeth's brother), how they feel about their relationships and what life was like in Richmond during the war. There's a great deal of rather random emoting; it isn't always easy to see what a given character is having hysterics about at any given time, and sometimes one just wants to slap them all. In the end, one of the husbands dies, and one comes home, but bearing the marks of a terrible war.<br />Dowdey was a well-known Civil War historian, and his research here seems impeccable. Jones' Diary of a Rebel War Clerk is among his most relied-upon sources. Unfortunately, we see very little fighting, though what he does write is very good. I would have preferred the book had it not spent so much time detailing the home front; others may enjoy that aspect of the period more than an endless succession of battle scenes.	2001-11-27

It represents far better writing than I have seen from him before. I was stunned. He continues to write from the POV of Abel Jones -- fussy, Puritanical, strongly accented despite insisting he's not, deeply prejudiced in many ways, brave and extremely appealing. I've rarely seen character building in first person done so well.<br />The plot here is marginally believable -- large groups of African Americans have been murdered, and for some reason the Union Army cares enough to have this investigated, and for some reason the Confederates accede to this. I'm not sure, sadly, that either army would really have lifted a finger. But it was believable enough to go on with.<br />Now we come to the fatal flaw. No one expects historical fiction, particularly when written from the point of view of a non-impartial character, to be unbiased. But one does expect it to be believable. All of Parry's Southern characters, black and white, are caricatures -- the fop, the redneck hunter, the brave but misguided young man, the Uncle Tom, the innocent slave girl, the wise African American preacher... and so on. I felt the story would have been stronger if all of the characters had been as human and complex as the protagonist.	2001-11-27

Honorable Company is written much more smoothly and with better descriptive detail. It continues the story of Hervey, now post-Waterloo, who is sent to India to complete certain rather sensitive tasks for the Duke of Wellington.<br />I found the setting here well described and rich, though I cannot speak to its accuracy. The fly in the ghee is the plot. Essentially, it's a series of spikes. Everything's going along well, and then some random event -- a French prisoners' revolt, a fire onboard a ship -- calls on Hervey to behave heroically. Even the later events, which are better tied in with an overall plot arc, have this &quot;problem suddenly arises; Hervey solves problem; problem goes away&quot; quality. There is the promise of subtlety and undercover activities here, but Mallison doesn't really exploit it. <br />Overall, characters are well done, with Locke being appealing and Johnson continuing to be vividly drawn. Hervey's sudden loyalty to the Chintal rajah doesn't seem sufficently supported in characterization or plot, and it's annoying that he succeeds in every single thing he does; perhaps in the third volume he'll face more meaningful challenges.	2001-11-20

Alternate history needs several qualities to be any good, and one of the things it needs is a basis in real, believable history. Unfortunately, Look Away barely slides by in this regard. Essentially, it's 1864, and European countries have formed a UN-like body which is interfering, as rather violent peacekeepers, in the American Civil War. I don't find this plausible: the UN seems like a post-WWI idea to me, not like a mid-19th century conceptual possibility. The characters as well have an anachronistic quality: their thoughts and speech do not, for me, contain the flavor of the 19th century. The book is very short, and it seems to me that such an enterprise should really take up a whole novel -- come on, *someone* has to write a decent &quot;if the Civil War lasted longer/went differently&quot; novel; there hasn't been a readable one since Kantor's well-written but Pollyannaish effort, and yes, I'm including Turtledove. Because of Look Away's brevity, character development, especially the main character's breakdown at the end, seems unsupported by events.<br />Having said that, this book has qualities I like: spare, stark language and a grim ending. While I didn't find the international peacekeeping force believable, I did like the idea of foreign intervention in the war, and the host of both foreign and local armed groups and militias that springs up; the Floridian imperialists were amusing, though only given a throw-away mention. It seems, unfortunately, that the author has more than enough literary talent to write a good alternate Civil War novel, but let laziness get the better of him.	2001-11-19

In addition, I hoped to find some interesting description of map-making during the war. I was quite disappointed. Hotchkiss' memoir is made up of diary entries with an occasional note added later. And they mostly concern the weather, troop movements, and where he slept that night. They are almost devoid of description, emotion, and overall detail. Though Hotchkiss does mention making maps, of course, it's in brief statements like &quot;Reduced Charlottesville today&quot;. His account of Jackson's death reads rather like &quot;Jackson died. Fine clear day.&quot; It's hard to say whether this dullness represents something about Hotchkiss' personality (unemotional engineer, perhaps?) or is simply a function of the way he wrote his diary. In any case, though scholars of the period will want to glance at this, I found it not very useful and utterly unentertaining.	2001-11-15

But in too many cases, when you turn off the moonlight and toss out the faded magnolias, you're not left with much. That's not the case here. Berry Benson, who spent much of the war detailed as a sharpshooter, was well-spoken, tough, brave and endlessly inventive. A good deal of his memoir is taken up with his Energizer Bunny-like repeat attempts to escape from Federal prisons. He writes his memoir well, with a degree of structure unusual in Civil War memoirs; and when he doesn't remember exactly what happened, he says so. Though he missed the battle of Gettysburg, he appends wonderfully written, humorous letters from his brother, who didn't -- this seems to have been a talented family, over all. Particular high points of this memoir include the prison escapes, as well as the detailed account of what Benson's unit did at Hatcher's Run; he's also quite vivid on Appomattox -- where, readers will note, Sgt. Benson eschewed surrender.	2001-11-12

This is all very well when they stick to facts, but too often they inflict their own 20th-century political beliefs upon the readers. That's particularly annoying considering the lip service paid to &quot;objectivity&quot; in the foreword.<br />The letters themselves are not exactly thrilling. The soldier in question saw little action and his letters (typically of Civil War letters) concern themselves mostly with relatives he's met and what he wants to have sent from home. His prison diary is interesting mostly in that its tone differs markedly from that of the letters; it's emotional and romantic, whereas the letters are downright dull. Still, the diary offers little factual information -- though he does undermine his editors' hoopla by stating that he was actually treated reasonably well. Whether he was &quot;unreconstructed&quot;, as the editors claim, is unknown, because no post-war writings of his own are included.<br />I'd skip this. The editing is annoying and the primary material adds nothing new or entertaining to the wealth of Civil War primary sources already in print.	2001-11-09

Delderfield's use of language is somewhat plodding, and there's something indefinably off about the story's pace. Still, for readers who stick with it, this book is worthwhile. It starts out with seven voltigeurs in Napoleon's army, and we know from the prologue that we're going to end up with only one left, but we don't know which one it will be. The process of whittling the characters down to one survivor is long, gruesome and, in its cumulative effect, emotionally moving. Delderfield is at his best in descriptions of camp life and foraging, perhaps not as good at large battle scenes -- I was disappointed to get so little on what the voltigeurs, essentially professional skirmishers, did. I would certainly recommend this for readers with a certain amount of patience.	2001-11-09

I'm reviewing, here, the entirety of O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series, because I consider it to be essentially one novel.<br />The first, and most astonishing, strength of this series is in its characterization. Not only are the contrasting, yet inseparable, friends Jack and Stephen believable, appealing, vividly human characters, but they change realistically through time. To the reader, they appear as \\"real\\" people with \\"real\\" lives, perhaps more so than some of the the flesh and blood ephemera around us. The secondary characters, too, shine -- Killick is priceless.<br />Research, of course, is O'Brian's other great strength. It's not only the ships, about which he seems to know everything. There's no aspect of the period -- food, dialect, religion, music -- in which he does not seem to be well versed. And he conveys this information to the reader in interesting ways, rather than encumbering the text with massive info-dumps. <br />One often overlooked bright spot in this series is its humor. Too often historical fiction has a self-consciously grim quality. O'Brian can be grim -- crushingly depressing, in fact --but... \\"Swiving Monachorum\\".<br />Action and battles are not, strangely, this series' strongest point. When we get them, they're great, but too often they are skipped over or told in a distant third-person viewpoint. But the worst here is still very good indeed.<br />I would recommend reading all of these, in order, starting with the first one, right away, as soon as you possibly can. It's true that The Hundred Days marks a low point -- I agree with the reviewers who cite O'Brian's loss of his wife as the reason -- but Blue at the Mizzen, under which I've posted this review, marks a triumphant return of the author's powers.	2001-11-09

There's not nearly enough written about cavalry. Research that seems impeccable to me, a nonspecialist in the period. Essentially appealing characters and a plot where plenty happens.<br />Bad: Mallison seems to eschew sensory description almost completely. We never learn what most of the characters look like. We never smell the black powder and the horse poop, see the colors of the banners, hear the roar of cannons -- and so on. Also, the pacing of the plot is strange -- several scenes which really should be &quot;shown&quot;, such as Hervey's first reunion with his family after several years, are &quot;told&quot;. <br />Overall, I enjoyed this, and I suspect that the rough spots in Mallinson's writing may improve in later works.	2001-11-09

Warshawski Novel)	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Readable, but logically flawed	I found the basic premise of this Warshawski installment interesting: a man believes that, through hypnotism, he has discovered that he was a Holocaust orphan. A disturbed individual, he attaches himself to V.I.'s friends Max and Lotty and their families. Meanwhile, an insurance scam unveils itself...<br />Unfortunately, the most interesting factor here, recovered memory, is never really explored. We don't learn very much about the character's real history, and (to my recollection) no one is ever hypnotized &quot;on screen&quot;. So an opportunity for some new and different scenes is lost.<br />Another issue I have with this book is a logical one. &quot;Paul Radbuka&quot;, Max, Lotty, and others are, or are of an age to be, Holocaust survivors. Since the book is set in the present day, that makes these people in their 60's -- at least. Yet none of them have any health problems, and all are employed -- Lotty as a surgeon, which certainly requires steady hands and clear eyes. &quot;Paul&quot; zips around town on a mountain bike. While certainly many people at the characters' age are active, healthy and vital, it strained my disbelief that they *all* act like people in their 40's.<br />Otherwise, I found this readable and basically enjoyable, but not up to the standard of Hard Time or to Paretsky's wonderful urban fantasy Ghost Country.	2001-10-10

The plot is satisfyingly spare, with a surreal Twin Peaks-like quality in the best scenes. I found, however, that the plot faltered badly in action and fight scenes, many of which had a static quality and lacked tension. The author clearly intended the characters to be mysterious, but I found them just a little too opaque: why doesn't Leo ever protest Veronica's uninvited screwing with his life? It seems that the author knows many things about the world and the characters which he doesn't choose to share with the readers. With better action sequences and more deeply revealed characters, this could have been a world-class novel. As it is, I found it very enjoyable but, as others have noted, a little flat.	2001-08-27

Riding on the bet is not only money and prestige but the hand in marriage of one of the captains' daughters. This is a cool idea, but it was nearly ruined for me by the author's inclusion of plot points I just couldn't believe in. Firstly, when her father the captain dies, Hannah takes over the ship. I can't conceive of this ever happening in the time period concerned: there is simply no way that sailors would have allowed a woman to command them. It's possible that Woodman could have made her takeover more believable by giving it a stronger foundation in the plot, but as it is, I just can't suspend disbelief for it. Secondly, Hannah falls in love with the captain of the opposing ship. This is someone she's barely ever talked to, has spent no time with and essentially doesn't know. I could accept her falling in lust with him, but at the end of the book she apparently intends to marry this person, and there's every indication that they'll live happily ever after. That doesn't sound realistic to me. What saves this book somewhat, despite the rather shallow characterizations and the implausible elements of the plot, is the occasionally excellent quality of the writing. The author describes ships and the ocean beautifully.	2001-08-27

Van Buskirk, 1851-1870	Books	3	9	13	N	N	Interesting source, disappointingly edited	Picking up this book, I expected it to contain an edition of Van Buskirk's diaries. Instead, it contains the events within them paraphrased and summarized by the editor. I'm not sure what the purpose was of presenting the texts in this way.<br />&quot;Erotic&quot;, in the subtitle, is a misnomer. Van Buskirk was a pedophile, though he seems not to have acted much on his desires. He was attracted, according to his diaries, to both young boys and girls. At least based on what we're given by the editor, he gives little description of any sexual encounter.<br />This book is fascinating in that it gives us a portrait of a disturbed individual. Despite the author's inexplicable attempts to portray Van Buskirk as normal, the diarist was not simply a product of his time. He was unable to keep a job and, on several occasions, absconded with others' money and possessions; when he joined the Confederate army, he deserted. He was obsessive, emotionally immature, and had sexual problems -- pedophilia, compulsive obsession and nocturnal emissions into his 30's. He was unable to maintain a meaningful relationship with any of the subjects of his quasi-sexual obsessions. Few memoirs give us such a window into the mind of a messed-up person.<br />Van Buskirk's diaries also provide information on life aboard US Navy ships in the mid-19th century, which was apparently characterized by frequent homoerotic behavior (which the obsessive Van Buskirk disapproved of but was fascinated with).	2001-08-20

The problems and motivations of the characters -- primarily Stapleton, the Union officer torn between two sides; his Rebel and proto-feminist &quot;adventuress&quot; fiancee; and the one-armed Colonel Gentry; are clearly carefully thought out. However, I found the overall premise, that of a giant Copperhead conspiracy to make the Midwest secede from the Union, improbable; though the note at the back of the book says it is historically accurate, I did not find this to ring true. Likewise, Gentry's letters, though supposedly taken from nineteenth century originals, do not sound period. Overall, the author clearly put a good deal of effort into the book, but it is a type of book which requires interesting and fresh use of language to succeed, and this is where he falls short of the mark. The writing here is mundane and somewhat flat, despite efforts at &quot;literary&quot; language. The book is also rather heavy on character interactions and &quot;telling&quot; how characters feel, while comparatively light on real action. The author makes the common error of introducing rather badly recreated historical characters from Davis to Booth. I wouldn't call the book an utter failure, but I found myself getting bored 3/4 of the way through.	2001-08-20

The main character has been marked by an angel (per the theology as described in the story), which makes her an *anguisette*, or female masochist. I didn't find the sex or the concepts especially offensive, but I also didn't find them wildly original. It's reasonably standard S&amp;M stuff. When Phedre's emotions get involved, as with her bete noire Melisande, things become somewhat more engaging.<br />The world in which this story is set is a pastiche of early-medieval Europe. It's reasonably well done, but could have been much better developed. I found the concept of the physically beautiful, genetically &quot;pure&quot; d'Angelines boring and verging on offensive. The theology which allows d'Angeline culture to embrace sex in multiple forms seems a bit scantily founded. Personally, I would rather read a book set either in medieval Europe as it was, or in a world of original fantasy. <br />The editing is appalling, with &quot;mendicant&quot; consistently misspelled and &quot;brethren&quot; treated as a singular noun. And I'm not sure if comments on cover art really belong here, but the woman pictured on the cover of the hardback edition is strangely proportioned indeed -- look at the length of her upper arms.<br />Having said that, I found this novel essentially fun and readable. The characters are appealing enough to keep the pages turning, and the political twists and turns, while not very well developed, keep things moving outside the bedroom. Occasionally lush imagery isn't anything Tanith Lee hasn't done better, but lifts the text above the mundane level.	2001-08-16

Here goes: <br />A number of people have complained about the main characters -- Havers, Lynley, and so on -- becoming more peripheral in this story. I didn't mind that. I find Havers' pathetic qualities annoying, and the whole British aristocracy thing has always been the element of George's writing which I find the least believable. <br />The essential plot here, I felt, was interesting. However, the timing was very strange. Apparently, some of the events occur well before Eugenie's death, but we don't find out that they are supposed to be timed that way until well into things. It's confusing, to say the least. There's also a point which is either a huge continuity error or sufficiently confusing to totally perplex me: Katja Wolff comes to see Gideon and ask for money, but he refuses because he doesn't recognize her. But throughout the first half of the book, Gideon speaks as though it's Eugenie, his mother, who came to see him. Huh??<br />The characterization of the prodigy, his disturbed father, and the father's demanding, selfish but believable fiance is good, although the psychoanalysis journal motif got a little nebulous. Gideon's girlfriend, though, was a ridiculous caricature of an American. The relationships of Katja and her lovers seemed believable, though I find it hard to credit that real British police officers are able to threaten people they are questioning with the revelation of their homosexuality. Even if believable, this behavior certainly made Nkata look like a bad guy.<br />The end is horrible. I don't demand endings which are all sweetness and light, but this was simply awful.	2001-08-16

Timing and pace here are severely flawed, leaving the reader wondering what just happened and why it matters. The &quot;who did it&quot;, when we find it out, is too obvious. Yet characters' behavior and motivations, throughout, are not well founded. The essential theme, that of the Southern Unionist (described by the author as &quot;neutral&quot;, inexplicably) who works as a secret agent for the North and whose loyalties are torn, is an interesting one, but it's not enough to keep this rusty ironclad afloat.	2001-07-21

It also has some of her weaknesses: overly exotic words and names, characters with too much power, characters speaking in nonsense syllables far too much of the time. The sequel to Wild Magic, Wildfire concerns Faan's ongoing search for her mother and her struggle to control her increasingly powerful firestarting magic. Some of the characters, particularly Sabuse and Varney, are not as well drawn as they probably deserve, and I got tired of Faan's adolescent temper. There's also a huge plot inconsistency concerning a black horse which does, or doesn't, get eaten by woodfolk. Despite all that, I found the book to be original, lively and generally a fun read.	2001-07-05

Upon putting it down, one concludes that this book was, at best, an unnecessary addition.<br />Madden covers similar material to the similarly formatted, but much better written, Time-Life volume Tenting Tonight. Very little of his information is new. He does offer some interesting rarely-seen quotes, such as part of the transcript of a Union prison guard acquitted of murder after having shot a Confederate prisoner who insulted him.<br />I found this book to be full of half-truths and inaccuracies. Quotes, particularly quotes from the wonderful memoir Co. Aytch, are used in a tendentious out-of-context manner. On several occasions the author pointlessly intrudes his beliefs about 21st century politics, which completely destroys any pretense of academic impartiality. The general tone is emotional, presenting the war as tragic and brutal yet &quot;necessary&quot; in that positivist destiny-of-America sense.<br />Despite the overall politically correct tone of the writing, Madden eschews meaningful discussion of colored troops, Native American troops, class and ethnic differences between soldiers, soldiers' beliefs about race and slavery, etc. Nor, despite the title, does daily life and mentality get much discussion.<br />Read Tenting Tonight if you want the large-format introduction with pictures, Wiley and McPherson and so on if you want academic studies. Beyond the Battlefield is not worth bothering with.	2001-06-29

It's a theme generally done very badly. She handles it well, keeping the focus of the story on realistic human beings and avoiding unbelievable extrapolation. Hard-SF fanatics may find that the nanotech is kept too much in the background for their preference.<br />Nearly all the story takes place during journeys. Some reviewers have complained about that, though I'm not sure why. The travelling is clearly relevant to the plot and takes place between well-defined points and for vividly stated reasons. Essentially, the world as the characters know it is going to end, and Marak, the main character, must try to save whomever he can. The book starts a little slowly, but the tension soon ratchets up exponentially. Along with the threat of utter destruction from the skies, Marak faces personal challenges in dealing with the people around him, including his murderous father.<br />The desert tribespeople are not Cherryh's most detailed or dramatic culture, considering that she is one of the best creators of sociological SF currently writing. But they are realistic and human. <br />The flaw that I found with this book was that I wanted more of the cataclysm, when it comes. An entire ecology is destroyed, as well as all the former lands and villages of the characters, and I wanted to see more of that.<br />This is an intelligently written book and I would certainly recommend it.	2001-06-28

She has created a plot thematically similar to her wonderful time travel work, in that researchers are sent to mysterious, frightening places, in this case through drug-induced near death experience. Clearly, she did a great deal of research on brain chemistry, the workings of hospitals, and so on, and the detail gives the work believability. She combines tension and humor well, and her characters are engaging. (Maisie verges on too cute, but doesn't slip over the edge due to her wonderful ghoulishness.) I found the basic premise of this work -- that death is terrifying, that NDE's mask or stand for something terrible -- very frightening. I wouldn't recommend reading this book at home alone at night, as I did!<br />There are, however, a few flaws. The plot gets slow in the middle, with a little too much repetition of the characters being lost in the hospital and other minor themes. More importantly, though, I had some issues with the use of the Titanic as the primary otherworldly setting. I appreciate the author's research on the ship, but the fact is, post-Leo and Kate, the Titanic is a meme whose time has passed. Because of the movie and its attendant media hype, I didn't find the Titanic images to be fresh, and that took away from the emotional impact. And why do so many people see the Titanic? And why do people who don't see the Titanic still see a passageway and a light? The plot leaves these and several other questions unclarified.<br />I'm not sure how I feel about the end. It's good that it's mysterious; it's a relief that it's not entirely tragic; but I'm not sure it makes sense.<br />Despite my quibbles, I enjoyed this book very much, could not put it down, and certainly recommend it.	2001-06-26

Fowler clearly read many historical memoirs before writing this, and recaptures their flavor so well that I occasionally found myself forgetting I was reading fiction. At the same time, the narrative is more continuous and dramatic than one would normally get in a memoir. There are a few very minor historical errors, but in most cases the research seems impeccable. If I have a criticism of this book, it's that it doesn't transcend its memoir basis quite enough: it could use more drama, more extremity. Still, it is very, very good, generally on a par with Killer Angels and much better than the wordy and hyperintellectual Cold Mountain.	2001-06-21

Hess does wonderfully at describing what battle was like and setting forth the ways in which it challenged men's courage. I found, however, that some of his analysis seemed forced. He makes statements which are not really supported by his sources. For example, he makes the claim that veteran soldiers were more likely to call truces with the enemy to trade coffee and tobacco and so on because they felt more self-confident than new recruits. But in fact, other sources I have read indicate that such truces were more common early in the war, before the soldiers got to taking it all so seriously. In other places, too, Hess makes claims about what was going through the soldiers' minds without really supporting these claims with quotes. He gives an interesting analysis of postwar viewpoints and the way veterans psychologically justified the hell they had gone through. I do wish that he or a colleague would write a similar study of Confederate soldiers, particularly on postwar viewpoints, since that would seem to be where they would differ the most.	2001-06-21

Inevitably, it doesn't give a whole lot of detail on each topic, but this is a very good place for general readers to start. The descriptions of farm life are particularly detailed and helpful. One complaint I do have is that the author does not footnote his quotes from primary sources, making it impossible to follow a reference up. Like most histories of daily life, this volume is short on information about mentalities and beliefs. Also, probably deliberately, it contains little information on political events and almost none on events in the South during Reconstruction. The effects of the Civil War on daily life and thought get rather short shrift. Nevertheless, this book does cover a lot of information and does so in a clear, useful fashion.	2001-06-12

The two aristocratic detectives and their wives just seem ridiculous -- the men (whose personalities are indistinguishable from each other) are absurdly old-fashioned and sexist and the women, Helen and Deb, are childish and self-indulgent. Juliet Spence is so psychologically cruel to her daughter Maggie that it's hard to read, not to mention hard to believe. The village constable, reminded of something he'd rather forget, freaks out and rapes a woman, even though he's supposedly never raised a hand in anger since protecting his mother from his father years before. Whatever. Suffice to say, none of the characters here behave in a believable fashion. Even minor characters' reactions just seem off, somehow. The plot, at root an interesting one, is convoluted and buried in detail which makes it very hard to follow. I repeatedly found myself thinking &quot;*what*...*who* are we talking about again?&quot; The setting is also strange: it's supposed to be taking place in the 1980's or 90's, it seems, but many of the attitudes seem decades older. Lynley, the detective lordling, actually has a manservant, and his girlfriend Helen has a maid! (Maybe British nobility really do still have bodyservants in the modern day, but it seems bizarre, and certainly helps to keep me from sympathizing with the characters.)Attitudes toward women here, overall, seem trapped in around the 1930's. The novel is a lot of work, and I don't really think it's worth it.	2001-06-08

It has the disjointed quality of many Civil War memoirs. Gill, who started out in the First Maryland Infantry, then transferred to the cavalry and became a courier, gives a decent description of First Manassas and of various cavalry fights. He was involved in the Valley Campaigns of '62 and '64, among other important actions. Aside from some vivid moments, though, his account doesn't give the reader much idea of what his experiences were like. I wouldn't really recommend seeking this one out.	2001-06-08

This sounds easy, but in fact it's the source of a lot of problems: a casual impulse or a child's unconsidered desire can have unforeseen, possibly disastrous consequences. In this third and best installment, Ilyana, the daughter of a non-magical man and a mother who is both a wizard and a revenant from the dead, tries to deal with old, dangerous magic and new magical threats as well as more traditional teenage problems. The family stuff -- not only between Ilyana and her parents but involving her grandparents' generation as well -- is sometimes a little too much like a talk show. The plot here also has a nebulous quality. It's much more comprehensible than the prequel, Chernevog, which was utterly confusing at times. Still, though, the exact nature of the challenges facing the characters is often unclear and the final outcome is hard to understand. Readers don't need everything spelled out for them, but they do need a little more clarity than this novel offers. Still, I found all the characters appealing (except for the mother, Eveshka) and the magical creatures are particularly well done. This book is better than the others in the series in that the characters do less apparently pointless jumping at shadows (though there's still some), more people and places are introduced, and the plot makes a little more sense.	2001-06-06

Most of them are only a few pages long, and few of the narrators repeat. Thus, it's impossible to really sympathize with any of them. The main character himself, gunslinger John Wesley Hardin, is hard to like: we never get into his head, and from the outside he looks like just another gangster. The reader sympathizes briefly when he's wounded and imprisoned, only to be put off when he commits his next act of mindless violence or drunken stupidity. The post-Civil War American West, as presented by the author, whacks the reader over the head with violence, lawlessness, and what I felt were rather gratuitous scenes of sex with prostitutes. I'm all for &quot;gritty&quot; historical fiction, but here it sometimes seemed like the author was just trying to show off. Without emotional content, grit is just an irritant. Having said all that, the book is intelligently written and apparently well researched, and it might be somebody else's cup of tea more than it is mine.	2001-06-06

His account of strategy, tactics and troop movements is almost completely unleavened with anecdotes or personal reactions. I found it to be very dry, very hard to maintain interest in. That isn't to say it's not an important book -- it is, very much so. There are areas where Alexander's knowledge falters and he should not be taken as a sole source of information, but in general, this is a very detailed and worthwhile account by an intelligent participant.

Accounts of the Battle of Gettysburg always seem to focus on who is to blame for the Confederate loss. Dowdey's version happens to blame Longstreet, primarily. However, Longstreet fans shouldn't avoid the book on that account. Dowdey gives a clear, well-written, though inevitably at this date somewhat old-fashioned, account. As no other author that I'm aware of does, he discusses the preparation for the invasion: the way that Davis refused Lee the reinforcements he'd requested, the way that Lee failed to rethink his method of dealing with subordinates after Jackson's death. I think Dowdey is a little scanty on Culp's Hill, but then I think that about everyone but Pfanz. Overall, this is a good basic analysis, definitely worth reading.	2001-06-06

He's acerbic, opinionated and occasionally thick-headed (as when he fails to notice, during the retreat to Appomattox, that anything is wrong). He gives a good description of the Battle of First Manassas and accounts of several other battles and campaigns, including Gettysburg. Although Blackford is justly best known as a Stuart chronicler, the most unique information given in the memoir is the description of how the Engineer Corps built the trenches at Petersburg. Blackford's endearing descriptions of his horses add a human touch.	2001-06-04

This volume is an exception. Despite conferring with Robertson, Jackson's main biographer, the author still repeats the myths about lemons, Jackson standing sole guard for his army, etc. etc. Overall the analysis seems light and the maps, which are very good in some other volumes, are too few. This book seems to me to only be worth reading for the illustrations. Skip it, and get Tanner's book instead.	2001-06-04

While some of the scholarship and language is a little old-fashioned and some of Wiley's ideas have been questioned by more modern scholars such as McPherson, it remains useful. Wiley presents a refreshingly rational and balanced account of Southern daily life. The material on soldier life is a briefer version of his seminal work &quot;The Life of Johnny Reb&quot;. This isn't a highly detailed study, but it will be a helpful and readable text for anyone wanting to improve their general knowledge of the subject.	2001-05-18

The scenes of violence in this story, which centers on the Battle of Gettysburg, are well-written and appropriate for the subject but I would think they would be too graphic for some young readers. Perez presents a Shaara-esque Gettysburg with a befuddled Lee and a Longstreet in the right. Her research fails her at one point as she places the Stonewall Brigade in the night assault on Culp's Hill (they were not engaged there until the next day) and the Second Virginia with the rest of the brigade (they were detailed as skirmishers on the far left throughout the battle, which is why they had only one man, Wesley Culp, killed in action). Most readers, of course, won't even notice this error. They may, on the other hand, find her presentation of young people involved on opposite sides of the war a little shallow, and her conclusion with the Gettysburg Address a little routine. Moments of interesting, original language do, however, lift this book somewhat above the general swamp.	2001-05-15

His writing is wonderful, evocative, heartbreaking. In the realm of narrative history, he is almost unsurpassed. But in this segment of his massive Civil War history, he gives very short shrift to one aspect of the battle of Gettysburg, the struggle for Culp's Hill. He characterizes the third day's attack there as little more than a single attempt, when in fact it involved at least three separate charges in Devil's Den-like terrain, and resulted in the shattering of Confederate regiments including the 4th VA and 1st MD. The mild inaccuracy is forgivable in this novelist's account, but the passing-up of the chance to add drama and interest to the book isn't quite.  ...his account of Pickett's Charge is excellent and I know of no other serious criticisms to be made of the book, as long as one takes it for the poet's history that it is.	2001-05-04

This psychosis led the North to believe atrocity tales about Southern prisons, and thus to cut rations and supplies to the Southern prisoners in their grasp. (Southerners also, according to Hesseltine, believed exaggerated stories of maltreatment of their own men.) Psychosis also led to the publication of a number of memoirs, especially of Andersonville, which report atrocities and ill treatment but are not accurate. That's the theory, and it's an interesting one, but Hesseltine fails to support it. He's on fairly good ground with the first part of his proposal: we know that the North practiced retaliatory measures on Confederate prisoners, and we know why. The second part is very shaky. Hesseltine never takes any single memoir or report and shows what parts of it are inaccurate, inspired by &quot;psychosis&quot;. Has he actually done a close reading of the sources, or has he simply imposed his theory upon them? It's hard to say. To me, primary sources, in particular memoirs by people writing about their own experiences, are &quot;sacred&quot;. The burden is very much on the historian to show that they are inaccurate, and Hesseltine does not do this here. He may very well be right in implying that some of them, particularly Union memoirs of Andersonville, contain untruths, but his word alone, without analytical proof, fails to convince the reader. Furthermore, in his bibliography of memoirs he appends some rather disturbing comments such as &quot;Illiterate,&quot; &quot;Illiterate and badly spelt&quot;. Denigrating the reliability of a Civil War document because of irregular spelling seems to me like questionable historiographical method. Lastly, Hesseltine uses this term &quot;war psychosis&quot; frequently, but he never really defines it. At no time does he apply the principles of psychology to his study, despite the title of the book. How are beliefs about the evils of a wartime enemy &quot;psychotic&quot;? Hesseltine has brought up some interesting questions here, but he has not answered them.te the title of the book. How are beliefs about the evils of a wartime enemy &quot;psychotic&quot;?

It has pictures of the sites where available and gives an overview of what took place at each one, who owned it, what troops may have been there and what surgeons were stationed there. The depth of available information varies, of course. I found that the maps were on a scale too small to be very helpful -- for example, I was unable to determine what route a soldier would have taken coming off Culp's Hill and walking to the Picking farm. The book would have been vastly improved by a chapter on the type of wounds suffered during the battle and the medical care of the time; some anecdotes and factoids are given but it's really not enough. As it is, the book is probably best read as an adjunct with Patterson's Debris of Battle and possibly Gangrene and Glory or some similar work on medical treatment.	2001-04-27

Although the memoir was written some time after the war, it seems quite even-handed and forbears to &quot;wave the bloody shirt&quot;. Ripple's account of his horrific experiences seems, if anything, understated and his fairness toward his captors is striking -- he views them as individuals rather than lumping them together as &quot;the enemy&quot;. People who enjoyed (that might not be the right word) the movie &quot;Andersonville&quot; may well find this book interesting as I believe the makers of the movie used it as a source, particularly for the escape attempt in which the prisoners are hunted down with dogs. His belief that Confederate prisoners of war were well treated and fed is erroneous, though understandable. This volume is enhanced by striking illustrations and useful, non-intrusive notes and introduction.	2001-04-23

It's based on the diary of the editor's great-grandfather, a member of the high-casualty 11th Mississippi. But the editor has fictionalized it. It's impossible to tell what was originally there and what has been added, and of course all the authenticity of the authorial &quot;voice&quot; has been lost. Does Wilkins' diary really contain one of the best first-person accounts of Pickett's Charge out there, or has Ellis made that part up? I'd love to see an edition of Wilkins' diary permitting him to speak in his own voice. The tiny quote in the introduction only serves to tease.

It's the story of two young Alabamian recruits in the Army of Northern Virginia, but it seems to really have been intended as a morality tale. It's all about race -- the lynching of black prisoners, the unsupported and unbelievable rejection by the main characters of racist beliefs -- and violence -- sentimental scenes with wounded Yankees and a portrait of a ridiculously corrupt army. Now, there's nothing wrong with an author wanting to make a moral point, but reality shouldn't be ignored. I don't find the characters' mentalities, the over-the-top portrayal of army politics, or the depiction of the Battle of Fredericksburg to be consistent with my own research. Davy, Josh and Luke seem to only exist as innocent, ignorant young blank slates for the points the author wishes to make. Davy in particular is far too saintly. In addition, the dialogue is terrible, with clumsy, phonetically rendered accents. Having said all that, the writing is occasionally good and it's not utterly unreadable, but overall, I don't think this is worth reading.	2001-04-20

Sharpe sleeps with gorgeous woman X, Y, or Z. Sergeant Harper wastes a bunch of Frenchies. However, don't take that as a criticism. These books are great. They're wildly entertaining and Cornwell seems to have a very good grasp on the events, tactics and battlefield realities of the Napoleonic Wars. In each installment, our heroes survive hairsbreadth escapes, the reader learns a little more early 19th century Continental military trivia, and battle scenes both thrilling and gory abound. What more could anyone want? They're not great literature, but they sure are entertaining.	2001-04-16

It's almost completely made up of quotes from primary sources, which means of course that it reads well. I was a little disturbed to see that the quotes are not footnoted, although there is a bibliography. Wheeler offers very little analysis of his own, which makes the book less useful. However, it is still a far superior book to his Gettysburg: Campaign of Endless Echoes and was a pleasant surprise in that respect. I have only one severe criticism, which is that Wheeler occasionally interposes his own comments into quotes with brackets: not only is that format distracting, but on at least one occasion his comment seems erroneous. Still, this is a pretty decent book.	2001-04-14

It's been severely edited: Bell Wiley, in the introduction, admits to having removed &quot;irrelevant&quot; material, regularized spelling, etc. I hate it when editors do this. I want to read the primary document as the author wrote it. Anyway, Nisbet describes the Valley campaign, Second Manassas, Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Ringgold, and the rest of the events leading to the fall of Atlanta. He was then a prisoner at Johnson's Island. Nisbet's writing is rather dry and probably not worth reading for entertainment value, although he does have some interesting views on arming the slaves (which he supports).	2001-04-12

Spelling and grammar do seem to have been edited, and it's impossible to tell what has been done to the content, but I trust they are essentially unadulterated and thus represent a useful source.

This works if you're a great writer like Catton or Foote. But Wheeler is not a great writer; his use of language is quite pedestrian, so the &quot;story&quot; aspect of the book doesn't really work. Also, without footnotes, some of the dialogue and the accounts of individuals' experiences becomes suspect. Is this material accurate, or is he making it up? The depiction of the battle is quite simplistic, giving rather little attention to events on the Confederate left. Wheeler puts great emphasis on General Stuart's activities before the battle, which makes sense when you realize that he has decided to be one of the Stuart-scapegoaters (as opposed to the anti-Longstreet and critical-of-Lee and where-was-Anderson crowds). In pursuit of that thesis, he puts thoughts in Stuart's head in a way which, without corroborating quotes from primary sources, seems unjustified. Overall, this book reads rather like a pamphlet written for battlefield tourists or an indifferent young adult history textbook. It isn't serious scholarship, and I don't recommend it.	2001-04-11

Because it covers several centuries in one not especially long volume, it doesn't seem to have been possible for the authors to describe any one topic in enough detail to really draw the reader in. The emphasis is almost completely on small details of elections and campaigns. The history of women and minorities is slotted in here and there, though this reader found it interesting that the authors feel the need to make a statement about the immorality of slavery while not feeling obliged to comment on the forcible taking of land from Native Americans. I would have liked to have seen a chapter on the natural environments and topography of the state so as to understand the ecosystems in which people have lived, but ecological history doesn't seem to have been an interest of the authors'. Overall, this is useful as an introductory volume but is really not what I'd call exciting or engaging. Perhaps the book's greatest fault is its dearth of useful maps. There's no good relief map and the maps overall are scanty and simplistic.	2001-04-06

Wicker exhaustively portrays the battle from many different viewpoints -- generals and footsoldiers on both sides, local people, photographers, telegraph operators, etc. The plethora of characters sometimes gets exhausting. On the other hand, if you find a specific plot thread boring, you know something better will be coming up in a page or two! Wicker has done an interesting reconstruction job in that he has changed and renamed historical people and events: substituting his own characters for real people, taking anecdotes from original sources (for example, the scene at Manassas Junction where they can't decide what to cook first) and making them his own. He does well with battle and hospital scenes and with the dialogue and experiences of common soldiers. I like his ability to incorporate  sex into the story without losing the &quot;period&quot; feel or becoming silly. Particularly good scenes include Hart's duel and the death of Cady. As for why this doesn't get five stars: There are one or two scenes where the rawness, the cynicism, just gets a little too over the top. Wash is not believable, and one of the hospital scenes was just too cruel even for me. The writing is fluent and enjoyable but it neither is nor tries to be &quot;literary&quot;.

It gives basic information on the political turmoil in Kentucky before, during and after the Civil War and on the few battles which took place in the state, including Morgan's raids. It spends little time discussing Kentuckian Confederate troops outside the state.

He describes pre-war Virginia society, not without some affectionate mockery, and gives sketches of people he knew during the war, from generals to the conscripts in his unit who enlisted out of a Richmond prison. His portrayal of General Stuart is quite good and his portrayal of General Jackson isn't so good. The ex-prisoner Baltimore Irishmen in the battery of which Eggleston was sergeant major are very humorously described. He was present at the siege of Petersburg and talks a little about that as well as about the retreat to Appomattox and the post-war state of lawlessness in the countryside.

His portrayal of the noise and confusion of battle is fantastic. He also recounts many amusing and interesting incidents of camp life. (By the way, the segments quoted in the Burns documentary are far from the best).

Alexander is straightforward, acerbic and perfectly willing to complain about what he sees as generals' mistakes. The unabashed bloodthirstiness of his statement that one of his favorite things to do is fire canister into fleeing Yankee troops is refreshing compared to the romanticism and nonsense of many other memoirs.

For one thing, the portion between where Gervase, the main character, is taken prisoner and when he is rescued out of the snow by the hermit in the woods is fantastic.

It is interesting as a portrayal of what happened to badly wounded men both on the battlefield and in later life. It certainly works as a story of medical incompetence (the result of low medical technology, not necessarily doctors' negligence). It really isn't particularly gory or harrowing to read -- very few Civil War memoirs are and this is consistent with the genre. What I found annoying about this book was the editing. The text has been cut down so as to only mention Roy's wounding and medical treatment, but the original document, as the editor admits in passing, was much longer.

(The latter is a depressing tale of race hatred, but at least it's well written.) One or two others are vaguely OK. The majority of them are awful. They are not written well; they are not researched well; they suck. The worst is probably Moorcock's surrealist nonsense, but Ballard's boring George Todd story, Wagner's silly cannibalism/undead tale and McCaffrey's sentimental plantation claptrap -- not to mention a plethora of Sherman's Bummers meet Zombies splatter -- just leave me bored. I'd recommend avoiding this.	2001-04-02

It gives a lot of information on soldier life, which was of limited use to me since I've read Wiley, McPherson, etc. etc. etc. What disappointed me about the book was its limited attention to civilian life and mentalities. Most of the material seemed relevant only to rich people and city folks -- I can't imagine that average 19th century people really used cartes du visite and spoon-warmers. I've been looking for some information on attitudes toward married life and family, and this is one in a long series of books that hasn't contained very much -- there's a little on child-rearing but that's it. There is quite a bit of information on clothing, perhaps aimed toward a reenactor readership. Overall, I'd recommend this, but be aware that it has its limitations.	2001-04-02

Reading this, one immediately sees that some of the organization, efficiency and filling out of many forms probably never really happened in the field. Still, it's useful in telling the researcher how people thought things should be. If used with caution, it's probably fairly accurate for Southern armies as well.	2001-04-02

Thus there are lists of slang terms, available foods, etc. etc. but rather little about mentalities or about how the different spheres of daily life worked together to form a whole. It sometimes comes across as a Trivial Pursuit sort of thing. Nevertheless, it is fairly good and does pretty well at describing soldier life.	2001-04-02

Flanders is historical fiction, well researched as far as I can tell and certainly extremely gripping, which happens to include ghosts. Anthony's re-creation of WWI trench warfare is tragic, frightening and disgusting. This is very much the worm's eye view and the characters seem to have little idea of the larger picture or even why they're fighting, whereas constant fear and physical discomfort are foremost in their minds. Anthony writes beautifully; her images are striking and she makes the difficult epistolary style work well. She creates believable and appealing characters, especially her secondary characters -- Riddell with his plants, LeBlanc the murder whom one can't quite bring oneself to hate. Travis, her main character, is a well-drawn mixture of depravity, kindness, moral cowardice and essential sense of responsibility. The supernatural scenes are very subtle and appealed to me as a reader who's almost completely \\"grown out of\\" fantasy. <br />In the end, the message of this book, the meaning of life which Travis finally discovers, is a sentimental one. It makes sense in the context of the book, and it may very well even be true, but for me it was too simple, too easy an answer. Nevertheless, this should be read by everyone and particularly historical fiction fans who may have been led to avoid it by \\"genre\\". I also think that readers put off by Anthony's previous idiosyncratic, slightly under-written work may want to give this novel a try.	2001-03-30

Photographic technology sucked in the 1860's and we're lucky to have what we do. It seems to me that this volume doesn't contain nearly all of Brady's shots, but maybe I'm just mistaking others' work for his.

They patently weren't followers of any cause, but I get bored reading about horse thieves and nineteenth-century homeboys. It's not easy for an author to make these guys appealing, and Goede doesn't manage to do it. His characters' motivations are completely opaque. I never figured out what was going on in his Quantrill's head. Because of that, and because the plot skips and jumps and becomes confusingly discontinuous, it was hard to maintain interest in this book.Occasionally the writing, as with the rape scene involving Skaggs, becomes interestingly transgressive. It gets three stars simply because the author is able to string words together in a pretty good way, and I'd say it has literary pretensions at least, but it just didn't work for me.	2001-03-29

Essentially, this is about &quot;who was to blame&quot;, and it fastens on several scapegoats, notably excluding Lee. The writing is enlivened by some good quotes from original sources. As usual, the fighting on Culp's Hill (my personal Gettysburg hobbyhorse) gets short shrift. This book is hard to find, and it really isn't worth making a massive search for. Plenty of other, better material is available.	2001-03-26

Some will run from this in fear, others, like me, will find it indispensably useful. There's no doubt that the book can be dry. However, Pfanz' analysis of the attempts to take Culp's and Cemetery Hills by primarily frontal assault, their failure and the &quot;might-have-been&quot; of the late Stonewall Jackson is very well done. He includes sufficient anecdotes to keep the reader engaged, and his description of the final assault, particularly its devastating effect on Steuart's Marylanders, is very well written. I wish he had said more about the experiences of the Stonewall Brigade, to Steuart's right, but there are rather few personal narratives from them of this event for him to work with. In any case, this is a valuable text and belongs on the shelf of everyone seriously interested in the battle; however, it's not for beginners.	2001-03-26

Norman went West as a restless young man and gives some interesting, if not entirely sympathetic, descriptions of the Pawnee Indians and his dealings with them. Returning home, he eventually joined up and fought with two North Carolina regiments, reaching the rank of captain. His descriptions of the war are comparatively limited, with Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville getting the most attention. His account of his imprisonment in a Northern prisoner of war camp is very circumscribed and adds little to what most readers will already know.	2001-03-26

Bonington's own writing, a little dry, is supplemented by interesting excerpts from the diaries of his teammates, including Pete Boardman, who as always writes beautifully. This is the ascent on which Mick Burke was lost. Overall, though not quite among the very best of mountaineering books, this is a classic and belongs on all shelves. The photos included capture the bleakness and mystery of the terrain and the precarious box-tent camps beautifully.	2001-03-26

In many ways his research is exhaustive. He quotes whole pages of dispatches from the Official Records and has clearly researched the Battle of the Crater and the units involved in the depth one would expect from a Ph.D. and former National Book Award nominee. When he relaxes and allows himself to write, he writes well, and some of the battle scenes are truly excellent. Where this book falters is in its storytelling. It moves slowly. There are too many characters and they become hard to tell apart. The action is broken up by too many retrospectives and dispatches. You really have to have a long attention span to enjoy this book. As far as Slotkin's interpretation of the period, it is very cynical; I put down The Crater thinking that the Union generals really deserved to lose the war for their politicking, stupidity and wanton wasting of their men's lives. Slotkin sees the issue of slavery and black rights as being central to the war, and his book reflects that. One place where he is rather weak is in his portrayal of Southern soldiers: they are not as human and believable as his Northerners. He presents an ongoing clash between officers, even NCOs, and privates which replicates the class conflict which is the underlying theme of the entire book; I'm not sure to what extent this clash really existed, but it is believable within the context of the novel. Overall, this is ponderous and hard to read, but for those who have the patience, it is a very interesting and rewarding effort.	2001-03-26

But the book isn't well written and the main culprit is the dialogue. Every character speaks in ridiculously thick, phonetically spelled dialect. All the Southerners talk in the most stereotypical way imaginable. The author's presentation of the horrors of Libby Prison, while eschewing any discussion of the equally awful conditions faced by Southerners in the North, gives a feeling of unreliability to the novel's status as well-researched historical fiction. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this.	2001-03-26

It does contain overviews of topography and early settlement that are somewhat useful. But Campbell, although he clearly tries not to be condescending, doesn't succeed. He's a missionary, and his purpose is to bring &quot;modern civilization&quot; to an underprivileged region. In discussing how he wants to do this, he never really comes to grips with the unique cultural heritage of the people he's talking about and the ways in which modernization -- his version of which is a sort of clean-cut, upright, Protestant Capitalist dystopia -- would endanger that. I can't really see any reason why a modern scholar would want to read this book.	2001-03-22

He discusses the viewpoints that people had going into the war and how they changed with the experience of combat. Perhaps the best part of the book is his study of Civil War veterans and the post-war reaction. Having said that, though, I found some of Linderman's scholarship problematic. He has a tendency to make broad sweeping statements (&quot;All soldiers thought X...) which worries me. His bibliography is a little short and is slanted, as is some of his analysis, toward Northern contributors. Thus, he has very little to say about whether losing the war was psychologically different from winning it, which one would think would be the case. Overall, this is a useful book but I would read it in conjunction with other works on the subject -- McPherson's studies and *Seeing the Elephant* in particular.	2001-03-22

This book tries hard to be literary and just misses. It starts very slowly -- the very beginning, in which Elias builds a homestead in the deep woods, is interesting, but then it gets slow with the exception of one scene of really disturbing violence. Eventually, the Civil War starts, and while those scenes aren't badly done, I was put off by the fact that Elias' big action scene is stolen straight out of the life of Nathan Bedford Forrest. The writing here is decent, and it certainly isn't a *bad* book, but there are so many others out there that are better that it probably isn't worth seeking out.	2001-03-22

They've combined them with a number of little-seen photos, including one which has got to be the most disturbing battlefield casualties shot I've seen yet. Amateurs in particular will enjoy this book. I did find a couple of flaws: the selections have been edited with a ... marking where material has been excised, and that made me wonder what I was missing. Also, the introductory passages to each section are pretty basic. Strangely, in the brief bio of General Cleburne, one of his most important achievements, his suggestion that the slaves be freed in exchange for service in the Confederate army, is never mentioned. So in terms of scholarship this may be a little questionable here and there, but it's certainly an enjoyable volume.	2001-03-22

I don't recall the book ever being credited in the movie. I hope Woodrell got his cut, because this is a wonderful book. It is written at a high standard of literary quality and the characters, despite their relative amorality, are engaging. The heroine is refreshingly un-Jewellike. This is one of the few books on the Civil War in Missouri that I've really enjoyed, and the excellent writing style is the primary reason. I give it four stars rather than five because the research -- on daily life in the period as well as the war itself -- seemed to be just a little scant. But this is certainly an excellent book.	2001-03-22

I read an 1866 edition (sans footnotes or introduction, unfortunately) and I could practically feel the anger spitting off the page. If you want to know how Southerners felt about reconstruction, this is a good book to read. However, I hope the modern editions have footnotes, because &quot;Arp&quot; refers to a great deal of political minutia and current jargon which is incomprehensible even to someone who's been studying the period. For example, he uses the phrase &quot;calm and sereen&quot; (the misspelling is for comic effect) a lot, with heavy irony. Was this phrase used by politicians at the time? The book would be a more valuable source with notes which would explain things like that. In any case, despite being occasionally opaque to the 21st century reader, this is definitely worth a look.	2001-03-20

It's written in a literary style which fooled me at first into thinking it might be a worthwhile book. But the historical errors were very off-putting. Just to name a couple of the obvious ones: The main character is, I think (though I may be wrong, because it was never entirely clear) supposed to be living, at the time of the war, in Raleigh, North Carolina. Therefore, it is completely impossible that wounded soldiers from Gettysburg (or any other major Eastern theatre battle) could have made it to her hospital.   Also, the portrayal of General McClellan raiding houses in Virginia with his &quot;bummers&quot; is purely ridiculous -- McClellan was actually censured for protecting Rebel property too *much*, and he wasn't even in command at the time the events are presented as happening! The characterization of Southern soldiers reveals the author to have eschewed reading McPherson, Wiley, Power or any other authority on the subject. So, historically, the book doesn't make sense. I also found the characters to be unlikeable. I actually found the father, loudmouthed and vulgar as he is, to be more appealing than the snippy, mean, judgmental daughter. I could never quite figure out why he's supposed to be so bad. There are hints that he's a wife-beater, but we're never actually shown that. And the structure of the text -- all the main character reminiscing after the events are actually done -- deprives the book of any narrative tension whatsoever. It gets two stars for the reasonably fluent writing, but overall, I'd skip this.	2001-03-20

Not that it doesn't have gory battle and corporal punishment scenes -- it certainly does -- but a romance is at the core of the plot. I almost wonder if the author was somehow inspired by his own marriage to an American. I found it interesting that the book focuses on the British army. Cornwell seems comfortable and fluent with his topic, although he doesn't explore some of the characters (Vane, especially) as much as he could. I know rather little about the period in question, and it would be interesting to know if the portrayal of the British army as both brutal and corrupt is accurate. If so, it would certainly help to explain their defeats.	2001-03-19

His facts seem far more accurate and more fluent, his characters' dialogue is more believable, and I overall get the sense that he simply has a better grasp of his material. This is the story of the young career Army man Sharpe, who finds himself in political hot water through no fault of his own, and who has to do something heroic to get himself out of it. The battle scenes are good, very detailed; the characters, as I've come to expect with Cornwell, are generally engaging though not particularly deep. I intend to read the rest of the series.	2001-03-19

While the conclusions the co-authors come up with are more or less what one would expect, the book is still highly interesting and gives a good picture of the mentality of the average Civil War soldier before, during and after the battle. One thing I'd point out is that this is *not* a tactical study of Shiloh -- you'll have to go to another book for that. I would recommend this not only to students of the specific battle/campaign but to anyone interested in the battle experience and soldier mentalities of the period.	2001-03-19

It chronicles the moral struggles and decisions which lead him to that point. I found the reconstruction of the court-martial of General Porter interesting, and I think the author's suggestion of a cynical Republican &quot;conspiracy&quot; to disenfranchise former Rebels after the war while giving the vote to freed slaves, thus ensuring themselves long-term voting supremacy in the South, is chillingly plausible. The description of the fighting and &quot;massacre&quot; at Fort Pillow is even-handed and historically believable. My problem with this book, though, is that the writing is rather cold. The descriptions somehow lack visceral impact, particularly when compared to The Falling Hills, which is also about Fort Pillow.	2001-03-19

It's full of great pictures (including some really gory photos)and maps. As usual, Catton writes beautifully, although his description of Pickett's Charge is a little understated for him. What this is not is seminal scholarship -- Catton's introduction, referring to the battle as &quot;fated&quot;, is absurdly though endearingly positivist, and his analysis of the battle and its causes is quite basic. I think the book would be particularly well suited to the amateur or, as another reviewer suggested, to someone who has seen the battlefield as a tourist and wants to learn a little more about what happened there.	2001-03-09

The author wrote this book based on some letters written by an ancestor of his. It's unclear to me whether the letters quoted in the text are those letters, or not; the language in them seems a little modern. In any case, Smiley clearly then went and read a large number of first-person accounts of the war in order to recreate the story of this ancestor. And that's the problem. Almost everything in this book is taken from a recognizable source: Hardtack and Coffee, Detailed Minutiae, Casler's book, etc. etc. If I drew a line next to every scene or line borrowed, with little if any change, from someone else, almost the whole book would be marked up. But writing fiction is about originality, not just research work. Another problem I have with this book is the generally pedestrian nature of the writing and the appalling editing -- major spelling and grammar errors persist throughout the work, and I'm not referring to dialogue. To the extent that this is a true story, it retains some emotional effect, and it's hard not to respect the amount of work that Smiley, neither a writer nor a historian, did; but in the final analysis this is not a successful novel.	2001-03-08

Hargreaves appears to have been a decent, determined, moderately talented climber, who pushed herself far beyond the point where she was actually enjoying the sport because of her need to make a living and her competitive surroundings. I usually dislike biographies, but found this one quite readable. While the authors do dumb down climbing terminology, they give evocative and gripping descriptions of the sport. This book saddened me, not only in its depiction of someone whose inspiration turned into her doom, but in its revelation of pervasive sexism in the way Hargreaves was viewed. While I don't think a woman who is still breast feeding should be free soloing, as she did (under the pressure of a relationship with an utter ne'er-do-well), the media suggestion that she was somehow a &quot;bad mother&quot; or &quot;bad woman&quot; because she climbed dangerous routes while having young children at home is preposterous. She was, in fact, financially supporting her children by doing so. This is an interesting book, worth reading.	2001-03-07

Worsham, who appears to have been a tremendously organized individual, gives minute tactical detail relevant to his company for almost every engagement he was in -- the Valley Campaign, First Winchester, Kernstown, Williamsport, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, etc. etc. As far as I can tell, he's generally pretty accurate, with the exception of the end of Third Winchester, during which he was wounded and not on the field. (He was disabled from then till the surrender and was left behind in Richmond when the city fell.) Worsham also follows up the fate of his company and of many of its members, giving a useful picture of what happened to the many people who left their original units during the war. I wish authors of regimental histories, in particular Reidenbaugh, would learn from this! On the other hand, Worsham's account is rather lacking in personal information, to the point where he quite often refers to himself in the third person. He had a very good career, being steadily promoted through first sergeant and to adjutant, but tells us rather little about this. His memoir is short on the sort of amusing or touching anecdotes that fill many other accounts. Because of that, this might not be the most congenial memoir for someone who just wants something fun to read, but its value to the historian is inestimable.	2001-03-07

His general description of going into battle is excellent, almost Watkins-like, and he's also pretty good on the subject of all the gear carried by first-year soldiers. There are also some amusing camp-life anecdotes included, but very little detail on specific battles. The narrative ends at Cedar Creek, where the author received his leg wound, but unfortunately he doesn't discuss that no doubt dramatic event at all.  The tone in some parts is interestingly tongue in cheek and even perhaps cynical.	2001-03-06

This story of three Everest expeditions, the last one involving a new East Face route, is also a story about someone pushing himself to his physical and emotional limits and paying for it. The book left me feeling as if I had read a tragedy, not a triumph. The photos, as other reviewers have mentioned, are gorgeous, though unfortunately all were not reproduced in color.	2001-03-06

It's very helpful for the historian in discussing the duties of NCO's and the composition of the company in formation. It rapidly becomes completely incomprehensible when  describing maneuvers and weapons handling. I can only imagine that whoever actually used this started with a good visual picture of what Hardee was talking about. There are contemporary anecdotes about inexperienced officers getting themselves in trouble with this book (e.g. the &quot;Piroute, piroute!&quot; scene I've read in some memoir or other) and one can certainly see why.	2001-03-05

It was apparently actually used during the war, which is hard to imagine, because like Hardee's Tactics it's pretty much impossible to understand.

Wert primarily focuses on studies of the major battles, giving enough first-person quotes to keep the narrative interesting. Occasionally his descriptions of the battlefield action are confusing, but that's probably a characteristic of the available sources. His discussion of the controversy over plundering at Cedar Creek is good, although I'm not entirely convinced. I find it a little surprising that, in discussing Early's failure to use his cavalry effectively, he does not mention the general's refusal of Mosby's offer of help, something which he brings up in his bio of Mosby. Also, in analyzing Early as a general, it might have been appropriate to mention the absolutely scathing and, in my view, entirely inappropriate speech which Early made to his troops after Cedar Creek blaming them for the defeat. Overall, this book has to be considered the canonical work on the campaign.	2001-03-05

Barclay gives good descriptions of the battles of First Manassas, First Winchester and Gettysburg (dispelling once and for all the myth that the Stonewall Brigade was not heavily involved in the latter). His expression is naturally limited by the fact that he's writing to relatives; there aren't a lot of humorous scenes of camp life here. We do find out something about the Liberty Hall Volunteers, Barclay's company, who were apparently something of a prima donna bunch and were often assigned as Jackson's HQ guards. Unfortunately, the letters have several gaps and do not cover the period from Spotsylvania, where Barclay was captured, to the end of the war. He was a prisoner during this period and it would have been interesting to know what his experiences were.	2001-03-05

Many of the familiar Stonewall Brigade and Valley Campaign anecdotes quoted in secondary sources are found here. Casler spent part of the war detailed as a pioneer, and his description of the work he did, including burying bodies, is interesting. He gives quite a few details on the Valley Campaign, Gettysburg and Spotsylvania. From August 1864, unfortunately, he was unable to march and was not with his company, which in any case was virtually wiped out. He was a prisoner in Fort McHenry toward the end of the war and gives an interesting description of being very badly treated until the Confederate government threatened retaliation, upon which conditions improved. I found it interesting how much time Casler spent *not* with his company, sometimes detailed elsewhere, sometimes apparently AWOL, sometimes participating in presumably non-authorized raids on the Federals with a couple of friends. This shows how little real control the CSA (the USA was probably much the same) had over its individual soldiers, a deficiency which surely did not do them, as the outnumbered side, any good.	2001-03-05

Maybe it's an artillery thing. Also like Alexander, he's refreshingly bloodthirsty -- no Gordon-esque blandishments about chivalry here. His account of the death of Federal Gen. Kearny contrasts interestingly with other accounts I've read, and his description of the surrender at Appomattox is particularly evocative.	2001-03-05

The writing is gorgeous and the characters are well drawn and immediately engaging. Strangely enough, if done right, this would make an amazing movie. There are many scenes of striking visual humor, particularly during the ill-fated charge of Gault's bushwhackers, and these are juxtaposed with serious themes and images. The supernatural blends seamlessly with the prosaic. The end, happy for most characters, was nevertheless a tear-jerker, but I thought it worked well. The theme of the soldiers never really being able to come back, of the war being a country that they will have one foot in for the rest of their lives, is very well developed here.	2001-03-05

It's a fun book. The analysis of the battle of Gettysburg is interesting -- that's obviously where Skimin did his research -- and the maps are good. The courtroom drama scenes are exciting, and one ends up wishing the author had included an epilogue telling us whether his imaginary CSA really made it. Now, the faults -- Skimin didn't really do his research on social behavior. His characters are astonishingly promiscuous for higher-class people of the time, especially the women. Also, his historical characters, particulary Stuart and Mosby, while reasonably engaging as imaginary people, don't really resemble the real-life version of themselves very much. His Stuart is too humorless, his Mosby too benevolent, his Breckenridge far too malevolent, his Longstreet too crazy. Nevertheless, if you take it as mind candy and not a serious work of literature, Gray Victory is quite a page-turner.	2001-02-28

Lentz does an excellent job of presenting despicable characters: the envious, cruel, cowardly Suttell, the uptight Seabury lost in his fantasy world, Acox with his excuses and denial of responsiblity. At the same time as the reader is appalled by these people, though, it is impossible not to identify with them, because their faults are in all of us. Lentz' writing is generally excellent, with very good combat scenes. I like his portrayal of General Forrest, and wish he had included Forrest's response to the final events in his story. The research seems accurate -- I wonder if his image of the behavior of black troops during a truce is true to life. However, I suspect that this book has a fatal flaw as far as ever gaining mass appeal. Lentz' world is too gross, too ugly, his characters too corrupt, his black characters in particular too stupid and promiscuous (although I don't believe the author is prejudiced: he's portraying his image of the results of enslavement). I like &quot;gritty&quot; historical fiction, and this was a little too much of a downer even for me. Those who like romance and highminded causes should stay away from this book. For those willing to descend farther into the depths, I certainly recommend it.	2001-02-27

It's impossible to tell what's happening at any point. The writing, despite the beautiful images, is thoroughly opaque and nonsensical. It's sort of about a man during the Civil War who goes back to a plantation where he once worked as a scribe to see if his promiscuous, mysterious ex-mistress is still there -- I think. I *think* he's remembering all this while he's on his way to a Northern prison camp. It's really pretty hard to tell. I don't recommend this.	2001-02-27

The basic idea is that doctors of the time, not knowing what germs were, transferred infections from one patient to the next. This is a well-known fact, but McMillan makes it sounds as though the doctors are somehow permanently tainted &quot;Gangrene Mary&quot;s. Of course, in reality, infection could only be passed on if the doctor's hands, bandages, etc. were tainted at the time they were used. Having said that, McMillan uses the concept pretty well to put her characters in an emotionally dramatic situation. I wish that she had included more historical detail -- I never feel that I get a real sense for the setting, as I do for the New Orleans of Hambly's 19th century mysteries. The war and military hospital scenes are reasonably well done but I wanted, again, more detail. Overall, this is readable and has some good ideas but suffers from an overall lack of intensity.	2001-02-24

On the one hand, Levy quotes and footnotes a large number of original sources. (Most of these seem reliable, but he uses several Chicago newspapers somewhat uncritically, which worries me a little.) On the other hand, his analytical statements sometimes seem questionable or even simply wrong. As one example, his claim that Morgan's raid &quot;pointed the way for&quot; Sherman's march through Georgia is not, I think, supportable. The book overall lacks a thesis or analytical framework. The edition I read was also very badly edited, with several paragraphs actually cut off and the text missing. Having made these criticisms, the original sources, particularly prisoners' diaries, quoted by Levy do reveal a vision of a horrific place to be. At Camp Douglas, unusually for the period, prisoners were actually beaten by guards and forced to sit unclothed in the snow, among other &quot;punishments&quot;. Levy does not analyze the fact that this brutality worsened significantly as the war went on, with the camp being reasonably tolerable in 1862 and a hellhole in 1864. Overall, this book collects interesting information but I would treat all unsupported statements made by the author with extreme caution.	2001-02-23

As in Brewer's other book, the most appealing character is veteran Masey Baldridge, with his bad leg, drinking problem and indifferent manners. In No Escape Brewer starts to  hint at a romance between Salina, the rather anachronistically spunky female lead, and Masey, which all seems a bit stereotypical and silly. In this book, the setting and the descriptions of the epidemic are better than the plot, which is a little shallow. Still, it's an entertaining evening's read.	2001-02-22

Books	4	4	4	N	N	Very detailed, engaging memoir	Readers who enjoyed Watkins' Co. Aytch will like this too. It doesn't have the absolute spark of genius that the latter shows, but it's an engaging, detailed account of Bevens' experiences in the Army of Tennessee. He includes many interesting and often humorous anecdotes; the only weak section is the very end of the war, because Bevens was lucky enough to be on furlough at that time. The editor has done an excellent job of annotating the text -- at first the format, with the footnotes on facing pages, is a little confusing, but it soon becomes very helpful. Sutherland fills in gaps and explains minor errors in Bevens' account while placing the events in their larger context. The only thing I have to complain about is the maps, which are useless.	2001-02-21

The parts of the book -- mostly battle scenes -- that appear to have been taken from original documents are fairly good, but Floyd has failed to flesh them out, so that what we end up with is a disjointed, scattered account that lacks dramatic tension. The reader gets to the end of the book and thinks &quot;wait... did I just read something?&quot;. The plot line concerning Wiley's wife waiting at home was treacly. And, as if that wasn't enough, the book is full of small but annoying errors: a piece of jewelry inscribed *19*-something for the year; the Orange Plank Road as &quot;a dirt path&quot;.

Keneally has as his characters members of the Stonewall Brigade, from the completely fictional Usaph and his companions to Stonewall Jackson and Kyd Douglas. He's reasonably historically accurate, and presents an exciting, effective story without romanticizing. His use of language is almost beyond reproach. His fictional account of the battle of Sharpsburg is the best I have read. If I have one criticism, it's that I thought Ephie was a little too &quot;easy&quot; for the time period, but that's minor.

It's certainly not a &quot;deep&quot; or literary work, but it's a fun, quick read. Brewer seems to be at his best with the character of Masey Baldridge, the sometimes-embittered Confederate veteran -- Masey is pretty much the only character in this book with genuine depth.

The problem that I had with this story of a young man who joins Quantrill's Raiders is that I found the characters' reactions to be mostly unrealistic. Jacob, the main character, acts and feels in ways that makes no sense. Also, the end of the book was unnecessarily depressing -- I don't always object to sad endings but this was just sort of... flat. The Other Side certainly has its good points but I can't wholeheartedly recommend it.	2001-02-12

Ballard rakes up every atrocity tale, every story of white abuse of African Americans, ever told. Some, like the massacre of black soldiers at Fort Pillow, have some historical veracity. Some, like myths of slaves being randomly shot by Confederate cavalry, have no foundation in any historical document I have ever seen.<br />But even if one ignores these things, one still has the stiff, unsympathetic, unrealistic characters and the boring, monosyllabic writing style to contend with. <br />Someone really should write a good book on the African American experience during the American Civil War.

His characterization of generals is identical (the down to earth Longstreet, the fey, religious Lee) and his writing style and general's-eye viewpoint are, I think deliberately, similar. But Moreau is not as good a writer as Shaara was. Some of his characters are wooden -- his characterization of Jackson is particularly flat. He does pretty well with action scenes and battle narratives, but he overuses certain phrases: everyone always &quot;bawls&quot; orders, everyone has &quot;great, dark&quot; eyes. I found his reconstruction of the battle to not much resemble nonfiction accounts I have read by Sears, Wert, Catton, etc.: Moreau seems to have simplified the action considerably for the sake of his story. What happened to the Stonewall Brigade, and what happened to the sunken road? This is certainly a readable book, but overall it's not a complete success.	2001-01-29

I did find that the way the letters were organized -- by year and then by writer -- was confusing. Perhaps it would be better to group all the letters by one author together.<br />The amateur may be disappointed by the fact that, like many if not most Civil War primary sources, these letters describe rather little action.

Obviously, as a primary source, this is valuable material, but I have to admit that I found it rather dull. Naturally it isn't fair to judge someone's personal letters on their literary quality, but I wish Goree had seen fit to describe his tasks as an aide, battles (Gettysburg, to my recollection, never appears here), or, well, anything. He focuses primarily on how all his various relatives are doing and so on. At the end of the book letters between him, General Longstreet, and other aides have been appended which will interest those studying the various controversies which have surrounded Longstreet. I really can't see how the non-specialist will enjoy this.	2001-01-16

It's the story of two groups of Confederate soldiers just before the surrender in April, 1865 and how they eventually meet, but that synopsis doesn't really explain what it's about. I suppose it's really about war and its dehumanizing and maddening effects. Deliberately transgressive, this book will offend many, but its sexual and violent themes are there for a reason and not simply to be shocking. Robertson writes in a tumble of words, at his best resembling McCarthy, occasionally slipping over into the purple. Some of the characters engage one's sympathies and some inspire disgust, but they are all quite well drawn with believable internal voices. There are a few minor historical errors but nothing really damaging. It will come as no surprise that Prisoners of Twilight does not have a happy ending (after finishing it I stared blankly into space for ten minutes and then picked up a first-person account of the war on the grounds that it was much more cheerful), but it is a significant novel and very much worth reading.	2001-01-12

Jones has a hard time maintaining narrative tension -- there are moments when the reader notices something and then thinks &quot;wait, when did that happen?&quot;, and the overall context of the characters' experiences is unclear, though that might be deliberate on the author's part. Through much of the text, drama is lacking somehow. On the other hand, during the last quarter or so of the text, the author seems to have been reinspired and produces some rather good writing as well as some dramatic action scenes. The end comes as a surprise and I'm not sure how I feel about it: without spoiling it, some major characters die, and while I don't object to that at all, I had a hard time with the fact that the one character left alive is one who was not well drawn and with whom it was never possible to empathize.	2001-01-11

However, it is not being marketed for ten-year-olds, as perhaps it should be, but for adults. (Not that I would recommend it to a ten-year-old either).<br />I don't quite understand what Murphy thinks she is doing with this Max/Mary Merriwell stuff. Whoever is supposed to have written this book, it isn't any good, and naming a character (Patrick Murphy) after herself is just plain weird.<br />The plot of Wild Angel is simply impossible. Without wishing to spoil it for anyone who still wants to read it, it involves impossibilities of biology and human physiology. Wolves do not adopt humans and small half-clothed children cannot survive Sierra Nevada winters, period. Granted one role of fantasy is to make us believe the impossible, but Murphy fails to convince me. The characters are shallow and scarcely developed to the point where I kept getting the various women mixed up, and as for the use of language, the Mark Twain quotes dragooned into chapter-heading duty were the only good writing to be found. <br />The book backs away shyly from any display of sex or violence, not to mention any serious exploration of themes of wilderness, civilization and so forth, which is why it seems like a badly written child's book to me. Clumsy &quot;informative&quot; paragraphs on wolves add to this impression.<br />It should come as no surprise by this point that I recommend skipping this book.	2001-01-09

Port Eternity is Arthurian in space, but is much better than that would normally imply. Wave without a Shore is philosophical, concept-driven SF which reminds me somewhat of LeGuin in a similar mode, though perhaps less self-righteous. I enjoyed it a great deal but readers who are put off by heavy philosophy may be bored. Voyager in Night is the weirdest of the bunch -- it reminds me of an SRL video. It's nominally an Alliance/Union story about a ship which gets kidnapped by an unknown alien; it's also about identity both personal and species. Overall, this is a compilation which makes sense and I'd highly recommend it.	2000-12-28

Primarily written in a narrative format, it is well written and will hold the attention of the non-specialist. I found that sometimes the author's narrow focus on the Stonewall Brigade made it hard to understand what was happening in the context of the war as a whole, even to the point of creating confusion as to which battle was taking place. I also suspect that more recent studies will have focused more on primary sources generated by the soldiers themselves and on issues of discipline and morale. Still, this is a classic work.	2000-12-19

Slaughter manages to write about some of the most dramatic events in American history without ever evoking a single emotion in the reader. The characters in this book are utterly wooden -- one doesn't even care when Stonewall Jackson dies, though this should be a central point in the plot. The author rarely describes any event from a character's perspective, preferring a distant third-person voice, and thus the reader cannot engage with the events. Deserving of two stars rather than one merely for the depth of research involved, this book is not really worth the reader's time.	2000-11-20

I was disappointed in that, because the villains here are a standard, boring Satanic cult; little in the book escapes cliche. At the same time, the usual sex and gore found in horror books are missing, which means that it isn't even entertaining on a base level. Wellman's protagonist, John, is never really challenged or in danger. He's too much of a nice guy, too flawless, and consequently boring. Also, the constant unthinking, sentimental Christian references give the book a sickly-sweet, treacly quality. Give this one a miss.	2000-11-13

While his writing in itself is not unskilled, the rapid descriptions make the book read like a laundry list.

It's inspired generations of climbers. If you're of a macabre turn of mind, it's worth reading for the frostbite scenes alone.<br />There's just one catch: It isn't really the truth. Beyond simply presenting the viewpoint of one participant, Annapurna involves whitewashing and even, more or less, lies. Dialogue scenes are Herzog's after the fact inventions, and events are manipulated to present a picture of unanimous heroism, with Herzog always in the lead.<br />I used to recommend this book as a matter of course. Now, I think anyone reading it should read Roberts' True Summit, and the writings of Herzog's team members, as well. That's the only way you'll get any picture of what the first ascent of Annapurna was really like.	2000-09-27

It exposes a web of dishonesty surrounding the classic account of the first ascent of Annapurna. Some scenes are provocative of outrage, as when Roberts describes the editorial notes -- &quot;Wrong&quot;, &quot;This must be changed&quot; -- made by Herzog and Devies on Lachenal's diary. Throughout, Roberts intersperses scenes from his own mountaineering career, which add immediacy and human interest. One nitpick I had was that, as a writer of history, Roberts should really have given a definitive list of sources and referenced his quotes. More importantly, I felt that he never really sums up his arguments. Why was Herzog's Annapurna the whitewashed version that it apparently was? Were the reasons nationalistic, class (amateur versus guide), personal? What can these events tell us about mountaineering as a whole? These are questions which Roberts does not really address. Still, this is a fascinating book and I certainly recommend it.	2000-09-27

Takeda's rather dystopian reality will seem right to many climbers, even those who avoid sick aid and tottering ice pillars. Most of these essays have been previously published in Climbing magazine, so it's surprising that the editing is so bad: it's full of typos. Nevertheless, this is a book well worth picking up.	2000-09-25

This is really a musing, a meditation on El Cap, not the definitive history which it purports to be. Duane examines the Big Stone through the experiences of some of its ascentionists: Harding, Robbins, Corbett, Middendorf, Burke, and so on. But others are strangely absent. Where is Piana and Skinner's controversial Salathe Wall first free ascent? What about the Wings of Steel incident? Where, for heaven's sake, is Lynn Hill? Duane is perhaps at his best when he interviews climbers, drawing intense, personal statements from them. Perhaps his tone is a little depressing, a little inclined to see climbing as pointless, but this is still a worthwhile, intelligently written book. For me, though, Duane's reductionist approach is, ultimately, not enough.	2000-09-22

It would probably have made more sense had Two-Spear's  part of the story come first. In any case, the art in the Kahvi series was  done by the less competent of Pini's successors, with the result that she  looks rather like a chipmunk-cheeked 12-year-old. They do manage to instill  some visual humor, as Tyldak attempts to hunt for himself. The story line  was exciting, even upsetting at times -- Kahvi seems to have somehow become  a less wise person than she was in the earlier books. There's an intense  fight scene between... wait and see. The readers discover the origin of the  Go-Backs, which is what I always suspected it was, though Kahvi's personal  origin (and apparent amnesia heretofore) seem a little far-fetched.  The  Two-Spear segment is more artistically, but more confusingly, drawn and  involves a story line with which most Elfquest readers are already  familiar. It's well done here but doesn't really add anything new. I'll add  a general complaint: Why can't any Elfquest artists, including Pini  herself, look at some pictures of wolves and figure out how to draw them?	2000-09-12

This, and his self-deprecating humor and honest tone, makes his books  appealing. In Triumph and Tragedy he gives us the Base Camp view of a  disastrous climbing season. He manages to neither gloss over his subjects'  foibles nor rake up scandal for its own sake. Accounts written by climbers  who were high on the mountain contain more on-the-spot information, but do  not replace this book.	2000-09-12

Set in a believable, well-drawn and original world, A Clash of Kings is  the continuation of Martin's fantasy saga. It is a harsh, unrelenting story  filled with politics, violence and subtle, well-described magic. Martin  captures the natural world especially well and seems to have a good working  knowledge of mountains! The frostbitten, zombie-like creatures which attack  from the north are especially frightening. Martin deserves praise for  creating a genuinely complex plot while maintaining continuity, and for  devising a fantasy world for adults. The writing is good, while avoiding  the sort of flowery flights that only Tolkien could get away with. In  short, this and its prequel are among the best fantasy novels of the past  20 years.

It includes  various different types of training and how to incorporate them into  workouts both on and off the rock. It's the sort of text that must be  referred to repeatedly -- reading it once won't be enough! Performance Rock  Climbing would benefit greatly from a detailed glossary for those of us who  are not experts in exercise physiology, and some sections, particularly the  one concerning periodization, are difficult to understand.

It's the story of two  worlds drawing closer and closer together until the boundary between them  dissipates and characters can talk, or even travel, between one and the  next. This is an original conception. Drum Warning also uses ritual magic  in fresh, well-described ways. However, it is a severely flawed novel.  There are too many characters and too many ill-defined subplots -- and most  of the characters are young adults, a common fantasy novel device that I'm  thoroughly sick of. Also, Clayton does something annoying to me, which is  to use Welsh language and poetic forms for some of the names and poetry of  one of her worlds -- without basing the culture on medieval (or any other  period) Welsh culture in any way, and in many cases with the names and  words being meaningless. I would have preferred her to have invented her  own culture and language rather than &quot;borrowing&quot; something from  Earth. I also disliked the pointlessly cruel death of the young girl's  pets, which is depressing without advancing the plot. This book isn't  unreadable -- there's certainly worse fantasy out there -- but I don't  really recommend it.	2000-09-05

They do fluctuate in quality,  but this one is by far the worst of the lot and is not worthy of being  considered part of the series. I suspect the co-author Lackey can be blamed  for the ridiculous &quot;science fiction&quot; parts of the story,  involving Terrans on a ship which crashes on Darkover. Absurdities here  include a spaceship full of opera fans, etc. etc. However, I believe  Bradley wrote the on-Darkover segments, which are little better. Leonie  Hastur has suddenly become the obnoxious girl from the Pepsi commercials.  Nothing is added to our understanding of Darkover here, which is a pity,  since for me the world-building has always been the best part of the  series. Also, both co-authors use a particularly pedestrian writing style.  And getting Leonie trapped in a computer? Give me a break! Unless you're a  diehard completist, skip this one.	2000-08-30

Both  well-known and less-visited areas are described in detail. I used this book  on a recent trip to Courtwright Reservoir and found it extremely helpful.

It is very much an academic text  and will be a difficult read for anyone without a strong background in  psychology and perhaps also philosophy or theology. Elements of the study  of folklore and mythology seem rather deemphasized. Merkur treats his  subjects with a reasonable amount of respect, unlike some of the scholars  whose work he quotes.

Nevertheless, taken  as stand-alone novels, they are both enjoyable. The Planet Savers is an  interesting study of a man with two personalities, representing opposite  psychological extremes... and what happens when those personalities are put  under stress.

Daughter of the Forest presents a medieval Ireland in which &quot;Britons&quot;, by which the author seems to  mean Saxons, are invading concurrently with the Northmen. This is not  accurate; nor is the vague, fantasy-cliche portrayal of early Irish  society. Even readers for whom historical verisimilitude is not an issue  will probably be bored by the plodding, mundane writing style and slow plot  of this book. I recommend giving this misty, New-Agey goop a miss.	2000-07-31

(How to Rock Climb Series)	Books	3	71	77	N	N	Undeniably classic, yet strangely flawed	This is undeniably one of the major &quot;textbooks&quot; on rock climbing, and contains a great deal of useful information. Yet it has some rather disturbing flaws. Firstly, even though I read the 1998 edition,  outdated information from earlier editions had not been updated. At times I  felt like I was reading a book describing rock climbing in some parallel  universe: Long refers to brands and items of gear not currently in  existence (what's a Salewa Antz?) and some recommended techniques (tying  into a trad anchor with the rope rather than with slings or a cordelette)  are very rarely, in my experience, used. The text often makes references  which will prove confusing for the beginner, and would benefit from a  better glossary. The 1998 edition also has some sections so full of  misspellings that they appear to have been written by a quasi-literate  person. In summary, everything in this book is good information, but some  of it is not entirely relevant to the way climbing is done today, and some  of it is presented in an unclear manner.	2000-07-31

As usual with Long's books, it is a clear and engaging read. It primarily focuses on movement on rock, footwork and  different holds, subjects which are difficult to describe in text, and  within limitations does well. Very little ropework, belaying or anchoring  is covered. The lack of information on belaying for sport climbing is a  little troubling, but it would be out of date in any case since this  edition precedes the Gri-Gri. The sections on competitions and indoor  climbing seem outdated, and readers will find some of the definitions --  i.e. &quot;soloing&quot; -- confusing. I haven't read Sport Climbing, part  of the same series, but it may represent an updated presentation of similar  information.	2000-07-24

Well written and with occasional engaging flashes of humor, Five Miles High gives a well-drawn picture of the large Himalayan expeditions of the past. At the same time as expedition members are having their food cooked  for them and having their gear carried by numerous &quot;coolies&quot;,  they are walking a much greater distance, and in some ways subsisting in  harsher conditions, than climbers do today. The contrasts with the present  day are perhaps the most interesting thing about this book. &quot;Boy's  First Adventure Book&quot;-ish illustrations at the chapter headings add a  charming retro touch.	2000-06-27

No detail of organization, logistics or communication is left out, with the result that we end up knowing quite a  lot about what the climbers had for breakfast and what was said during  their radio conversations; but I see this as a good thing.

It's too bad that so little of the book concerns his actual  climbing. Instead, we get rehashed bits from the bloated &quot;Everest  1996&quot; oeuvre, interspersed with historical factoids which either  needed chapters of their own or to be edited out entirely. I suspect the  latter are the work of the co-author. Kropp sounds like an interesting  person, a true &quot;lily of the field&quot;-type climbing bum, but we hear  too little about him. I'd still recommend this book, but readers may find  themselves skimming parts of it.	2000-06-12

I found that the two main male characters were so similar as to be indistinguishable.  The plot was, at best, nebulous. It was rarely clear what was going on or  even who each character was, which had the result of making it hard to care  what happened. Overall, it seemed that the author was constantly trying to  convey some &quot;deep&quot; philosophical point, but without ever really  saying anything profound. Some of the better scenes are very reminiscent of  her earlier work involving magical creatures and shapechanging, and  I'd  recommend rereading those instead.	2000-06-05

Like many books about Himalayan expeditions, Shishapangma focused on disagreements within the team. But whereas in other  cases this has been amusing or affecting, here it seemed dreary, and  unfortunately tinged with misogyny. The climbing itself is described in  rather dull terms; one gets little sense of excitement or danger. Scott's  informational/philosophical postscripts may actually be the best part of  the book. Don't read this one unless you're studying the route or are a  real completist.	2000-06-05

The art is beautiful, as opposed to the horrible scribbles in some of the other non-Pini EQ books, and the plot is engaging, if occasionally somewhat undeveloped. However, EQ fans should  be warned that this book has far more humans in it than it does elves. The  Wolfriders do not appear, and the time period is comparatively modern --  pistols and steam power have been invented. Winnowill is now a sort of  sadistic &quot;soul vampire&quot;, which is not how I interpreted her  character in the original books; she has lost some subtlety. Since the  connection with nature that the Wolfriders and Go-Backs have is my favorite  thing about EQ, I found Rogue's Curse slightly disappointing. Still, it's  worth a read.	2000-06-01

If you read  this expecting accurate historical fiction you will be disappointed, as it  has many elements of magic and does not really capture the &quot;feel&quot;  of the time in a believable way. If the author was trying to create an  accurate reproduction, she failed. However, this book is still worth  reading. Many of its themes are taken from medieval fiction such as the  writings of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and this gives it a fresh, creative  feel. Most of all, it is interesting in that much of it is narrated by a  monk who utterly despises the actions and morals of the characters with  whom the reader sympathizes. Jakober portrays this bitter, repressed man's  mentality in a subtle, intelligent way which may leave some readers  wondering who the good guys are. The supernatural elements in the book are  generally well done and have an interesting folkloric feel, although  Jakober's interpretation of the god Odin leaves something to be desired.  Overall, not a great work of literature, but an interesting read.	2000-05-23

This issue of Ascent is superior to some of the others. More professional and less flaky, it contains gripping trip reports and hilarious satire. The poetry is overall good, though very focused on the work of one author. The  photography is beautiful but too much of it is in black and white.

It may seem unkind to trash a book written by someone who survived the terrible ordeal that Mr. Weathers did. However, I really think this is a dreadful book. It reads like a religious tract: man becomes separated from his family due to his obsession with (insert alcohol, gambling, work or mountaineering here), barely survives through miraculous intervention, and is a changed man from that day onward. There's almost no description of climbing here. The Everest expedition is over within the first few chapters! Instead, most of the book is a long history of Weathers' childhood and family life; why this should interest anyone is unclear. If you're looking for a book about climbing, adventure or the beauties of nature, avoid this.	2000-05-16

I wanted to change my rating to a 5 but couldn't.    There was more than enough information about Barrakketh and the Sihhe; more might have spoiled the air of mystery. There was also plenty of physical action (the book immediately preceding was a bit slow physically, but this one was not).    I still wanted to see Tristen pushed more to the wall, but I have a greater appreciation of the danger to him in the final battle. His identity was at risk, and he held onto it.    I wonder if there really is, as rumored, a sequel on the way. It does seem that, of all the potential royal ranks for claimants to hold, that of \\"High King\\" snuck into the picture quietly at the very end of DRAGONS. I would like to see Tristen challenged in different ways in a sequel (we already know he can control lines and wards and the strength of his love and faithfulness. We need to see something new) and perhaps challenged more painfully. He keeps regarding human relationships, particularly romantic ones, with a sort of outsider wistfulness. Could something happen with that? And could there be some rediscovery of the lost four Sihhe that wouldn't be an anticlimax of too much information? I trust Ms. Cherryh to accomplish that, if anyone can. And it does seem, per her website, that there might be a sequel coming.    I don't think the cover art of this series serves it well; it's sort of stodgy and in at least one cover Tristen looks like he's modeled on Andy Garcia or someone. I think it would be better served by something more mystical, Pre-Raphaelite art or Thomas Canty. Not that the publisher cares what I think, but, well.    Now the old text begins...    This book takes its good qualities from Cherryh's excellent use of language -- few set a creepier scene -- and her depth of worldbuilding, which creates a fascinating setting. I very much enjoyed reading it.  However, it had flaws. Firstly, there was too littlephysical action; the  balance was tipped too far toward the otherworldly. Secondly, I was  disappointed to discover that many of my questions from earlier in the  series are never answered; the Sihhe remain a mystery. Most of all, I was  sorry to see that Tristen was never really challenged. His enemy toys with  him a little, but I wanted to see him tormented, forced into recollection  of his life as Barrakketh, ripped apart by the revelation of his real  nature, or at the very LEAST physically injured. More melodrama, please! I  wish Ms. Cherryh would do to her characters what Barbara Hambly has  recently been doing to hers.    (OK, I was a sadistic little beast five years ago. I still think Cherryh pulls the punches just a bit, but a more patient read revealed a better book than I initially gave it credit for.)	2000-05-15

In some ways, Wurts' writing is excellent. She has created a reasonably well-drawn world, with a very original plot and characters. She makes an effort to write in an artistic, poetic way... and therein lies a problem. Apparently, nobody's ever told her that one should show readers things  rather than telling them. Thus, every tiny detail of the book is explained  over and over, exhaustively. Why use one sentence where three will do? Why  allow inference when you can bludgeon your readers with words? Furthermore,   her efforts at poetic writing sometimes trip her up. She occasionally uses  words with no apparent understanding of their definitions, and spouts  flowery phrases which, examined closely, make no sense. My favorite was  &quot;permafrost clarity&quot;. Think about that one for a minute...       Add to this a plot with various holes and exceedingly slow action, much  slower than in the previous books, which were not exactly fast-moving. On  the plus side, the obnoxious Dakar does not appear until halfway through  the book, and Arithon's endless whining seems somewhat curbed. One factor  that I found troubling was the all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-male  Fellowship Sorcerers... as compared to those nasty meddling female Koriani  witches.       If you're already immersed in the series, you'll read this  anyway, and probably enjoy it to some extent. If not, you would want to  start with the first book in any case... but don't say I didn't warn you.	2000-05-03

It is told as a middle of the 3rd Millenium history book about the Middle Time, around 1975, it consists of  several threads intricately woven together, and when you get into it, it  most of all appears as a psychological fantasy novel: people taking on each  other's identities, sharing identities, having split personalities. And  even after having read this book, you'll still have the greatest subtlety  of Madsen's left to discover - the way in which all his works are tightly  woven together - you'll find stories, which are main plot threads in one  book as mere remarks in other books, you'll rejoice meeting main characters  in one book again as extras in other books...

The Arthurian canon has been written about over and over, and in some cases by better writers than Paxson. In this series' favor is her knowledge of Saxon culture and religion, which adds a new and different element, and her fairly good use of original texts as her sources. Negative points are  her sometimes mundane prose and her occasionally clumsy, Bradley-influenced  dialogue. I found it annoying that, as in many other fantasy books, a woman  who seeks power for herself (Morgause) is seen as evil and corrupt, whereas  a man who seeks power (Artor) is following his &quot;destiny&quot;. And why  is it OK for Guendivar (Guinevere) to sleep with several men but negative  when Morgause does it? Overall, this book is an enjoyable read, but the  flaws make it hard to recommend it whole-heartedly.	2000-04-27

The only element which Paxson adds to the Arthurian story is  her greater understanding of Saxon culture and magic. She does a good job  of basing her reconstruction on near-contemporary texts, and is an  engaging, though not &quot;literary&quot;, writer. I'd recommend her other  books, but this one is only for Arthur fans who can stand to hear the same  thing yet again.	2000-04-26

The first part of the book focuses on the self-indulgent, whiny Pharinet, whose  greatest ambition is to sleep with her brother. It takes her, as I recall,  84 pages to get there. Pharinet rather abruptly becomes a secondary  character in the second part, which focuses on Varencienne, ingenuous  sister of the Imperial Prince Bayard. Throughout the book, there are  moments of decadence which bring happy recollections of the Wraethhu books,  and hints of fascinating political maneuvers -- the book ends with one of  these, offering some hope. However, the book is much longer than it needs  to be, with many scenes lacking action, drama or interest. We learn very  little about the world in which the story is set, even though the natural  environment, in the form of sea and fire, is vital to the plot. The writing  has a mundane quality which compares badly to that of genre masters such as  Tanith Lee. In short, throughout most of Sea Dragon Heir, your reviewer was  bored.	2000-04-26

In my opinion ATP returns to the humor and  excitement of Virtual Light, and is notably better than Idoru. The book's  major flaw is that the impending &quot;end of the world&quot; is never  clearly described, and seems to fizzle at the end -- on some level, the  plot lacks seriousness.

As such, not only does he make some factual errors, but he also fails to write meaningfully about climbing as a risk-taking activity. He does not have the knowledge to  distinguish between socialites on Everest and Alex Lowe in a portaledge  camp on Baffin Island -- to him it is all equally &quot;extreme&quot;.       When writing about the avalanche around which the book is centered, Jenkins  is reasonably interesting, though his writing reminds me somehow of a true  crime novel. The narrative does not build excitement very well because of  constant disgressions.      The most interesting part of this book by far  is the technical discussion of snow, weather patterns and avalanches. It's  a pity that these sections, perhaps in an effort to appeal to the mass  market, are also the shortest.	2000-04-21

The plot was nebulous; by the time I figured out what was going on, I didn't care. The writing, while always showing talent, was full of  &quot;empty&quot; detail which neither elucidated Foy's (rather confusing)  world nor advanced the plot. I found the main character petulant, annoying  and ethnically improbable (Caribbean/Creole yet occasionally speaks in  Scots dialect).

But this is far from being her best work. It is much longer than it needs to be, and is weighed down with endless, repetitive mundane detail. One likes, in a historical novel, to be immersed in the characters'  daily lives, but one does not need to hear the same thing described over  and over -- especially when it's embroidery! The plot is somewhat nebulous  and hard to follow, perhaps due to being essentially buried. Also, I found  Maria to be petulant, sneaky and whiny. I wouldn't recommend that this book  be outright avoided, but I'd suggest getting it from the library.	2000-04-06

Perhaps because of a lack of historical sources, Holland gives rather little &quot;local  color&quot; and cultural information when discussing the Magyars; this was  somewhat disappointing to me, since I find the so-called barbarian peoples  of Europe fascinating. Also, the plot was slightly thin when compared to  her other, excellent works. Nevertheless, this is well worth reading.	2000-03-30

The chapters are written alternately by Bonington and Clarke, both of whom write engagingly. The alternation of voices keeps the narrative moving.  However, I found the book somewhat slow, because much of it concerns the  problems of Third World travel, plumbing (or lack thereof) and medicine  rather than actual climbing. Readers who are non-climbers, though, may well  find this lack of focus on technical mountaineering to be a plus. One  certainly does get a good picture of what Tibet and its people are like  today. Perhaps one of the book's best features is the lovely photography of  some very striking peaks.	2000-03-27

I was very pleasantly surprised. Firstly, the author uses language beautifully, and has a keen eye for animal behavior. Secondly, the plot and characters are  refreshingly original -- while reminiscent of Adams' excellent The Plague  Dogs, the book resembles Tailchaser's Song (which I didn't like) rather  little, and I'm not sure what the reviewer was thinking who made the  connection with Gallico's book. If I have a criticism, it's that the  villain ( so far -- I'm not quite done with the book) has a nebulous,  confusing quality which makes him less than purely terrifying. Overall,  this is an excellent fantasy, very much intended for intelligent adults.	1999-12-10

McKinley's Worst Storm Ever	Books	2	4	6	N	N	Amazing arrogance	I agree with many of the other reviewers' criticisms of Kocour's writing style and her contemptuous attitude toward other climbers. I would add that for her to refer to her experience as &quot;extreme&quot; shows her  complete lack of credibility as a climber. Ms. Kocour was bored, cold and  scared, and her feet got cold -- that's all. Meanwhile, others died in the  same storm. If you want to read about an &quot;extreme&quot; experience on  Denali, try Davidson's Minus 148 or Waterman's In the Shadow of Denali. I  also second those who recommended the Boardman-Tasker Omnibus.	1999-12-10

Some of the chapters -- most of which are reprints of the author's column in Climbing  -- are better than others, but the best are laugh-out-loud funny.	1999-12-08

On first glance, the reader may think &quot;WHY should I read something that's just a retelling of the Romeo and Juliet story?&quot;. Why should you? Firstly, Tanith Lee writes beautifully. Secondly, this book is filled  with subtleties -- weird cultural shifts that aren't quite what one would  expect from Renaissance Italy; mysterious, unspoken relationships between  characters. It may well take you more than one reading to really appreciate  this book, but it's worth it.	1999-12-08

The first, an Alaskan mountaineering epic, leaves the reader amazed that the lone survivor made it; the second, about Scott  Fischer on K2, leaves the reader amazed at Fischer's having survived as  long as he did; and the third, Potterfield's own story, spawned much heated  discussion and controversy among climbers. Clearly, Potterfield fell  because he lost his grip on the rock, but why did he fall to the end of the  rope? Did his belayer drop him...? That would certainly explain why he  doesn't analyze the accident in more detail. In any case, the last story is  the best, not only because it explodes those dearly-held beliefs in  fainting before impact, but because it gives a detailed chronicle of a  difficult high-angle rescue. Unfortunately, Potterfield does not write very  well, but I suspect most readers will hardly notice.	1999-12-07

In the light of Osman's subsequent death, it's tempting to read foreshadowings of doom into the story: Does Osman's forgetting an appointment with Todhunter presage some  kind of deterioration on his part, perhaps contributing to his fatal fall?  Truthfully, probably not, but it's impossible not to speculate.<br />The fact  that Todhunter is a recreational, not a fanatical, climber, makes the book  more accessible and keeps him from sensationalizing the sport as a whole.  Still, many people seem not to realize, and it's worth reiterating, that  Osman died rope jumping, not rock climbing.<br />This book is definitely worth  your time.	1999-12-07

There's no doubt that Whittaker is one of America's best climbers. Were he only one of America's best writers as well, this book would be more enjoyable. As it is, much of the book is taken up with anecdotes in which  the author proves to be smarter, tougher, and/or better prepared than  someone else. The text is emotionally flat and sometimes boring, with  rather little detail being given on Whittaker's climbing exploits. The  author's dismissal of Galen Rowell on K2 is frankly ridiculous. There is  some useful information here, but overall, it's not a book I would  recommend.	1999-11-11

Heart-breaking, tense and on some level maddening, this is the story of Pete Boardman and Joe Tasker's last expedition. Copious quotes, especially from Pete's diary, give it its emotionally touching quality. Bonington  chillingly describes the survivors' long wait and gradual realization that  something has gone terribly wrong. No one really knows what happened to  Boardman and Tasker, especially since their bodies were later found,  indicating they were not killed in a fall as Bonington surmised. This book  cannot illuminate the mystery, but can illustrate the magnitude of our  loss.	1999-10-18

A glowing, praise-filled biography of someone everybody seems to have loved, probably with good cause.

Beautifully written (and/or beautifully translated), it presents a romantic, joyous view of climbing which may seem foreign to many modern  climbers. The material on Alpine expeditions is very similar to that found  in the works of Diemberger and Buhl, so it probably isn't worth buying the  book for those alone; Rebuffat skips over Annapurna, for reasons which  become clear when you read the introduction. _Starlight and Storm_ does,  however, have an added bonus in a wonderful essay on climbing and danger,  included in the section on technique. Overall, a book worth having.	1999-09-20
