This book answers that question for author S. Peter Lewis.  More than just a story of how he built his ultimate treehouse it is the story of one man pulling together the resources he needs to create his dream.  As he states in the prelude it is the story of a process more than a product.  The story covers almost three years from planning to build his house in the trees to its ultimate completion.  In short order the reader soon comes to feel they are a part of this grand scheme and a participant in its completion.  With details of how the house was built, including joint techniques, exploded view diagrams, and short vignettes of the surrounding countryside that the author loves, it is a very interesting book and a memorial to the untamed spirit of childhood.  Treehouse Chronicles is a highly recommended read.	2005-10-07

This can be a very powerful technique if done well.  On the other hand some conservative churchgoers may have problems with a sermon where acting is an important part of it.  The funny thing is that these same people will generally enjoy attending a passion play or other similar form of acting out the gospel.  This book is about how to go from a text sermon to a narrative one and takes you through the process step-by-step.  The author doesn't suggest that this style should be used for every sermon but provides an alternative style to add to the preaching techniques of the minister.  A very instructive and useful book it makes a teaching style as well as preaching technique available to everyone.  Effective First-Person Biblical Preaching is highly recommended.	2005-09-18

There are many, many books on the market discuss how business leaders often get into a mental rut and as a result miss important opportunities.  While this one is similar it is also very different in that it not only provides much better examples but also provides suggestions and methods on how to get out of that mode of thinking.  The authors discuss how we develop models of the world around us, how they serve us, and how they can also entrap us.  But that is not where the book ends.  They discuss how to see the other mental model possibilities, how to know when to switch, how to deal with context so you get the appropriate picture, using cognitive experimenting to expand your ability to perceive other directions, dismantling the old way, bridging disconnects, and adapting to the world.  Part of the purpose of the book is to help you develop the ability to react quickly and creatively.  They provide several examples of people who have done the impossible by reframing the mental model that others were stuck in.  The appendix covers the neuroscience behind mental models for those who really want to understand how we get trapped in these models.  A fascinating book that does an excellent job of exposing how our thinking gets in the way of many things we do, The Power of Impossible Thinking should be required reading for all business managers and highly suggested for everyone since such mental model problems pervade all aspects of life.	2005-09-18

If you already know something about Samba then this is the place you will find very detailed explanations of all the internal and external capabilities of Samba-3.0.11 and higher.  While it is easy enough to find information on how to set Samba up as a file and print server, how to use its other features is harder information to come by.  This book details setting up Samba as a domain controller, backup domain controller, or domain member, network browsing, access controls, record locking, securing Samba, interdomain trusts, printing support, user profiles, administration, monitoring, and tuning.  A voluminous tome, most people will not be inclined to read through it but would more likely read the sections relevant to their current needs and the book is organized so that it is easy to use that way.  A true technical reference it has everything you are likely to ever want to know about Samba-3 and how to set it up correctly as well as how to resolve common problems.  This is a reference that I will be keeping close at hand and you will want to too if you use Samba-3.  The Official Samba-3 Howto and Reference Guide, Second Edition is highly recommended.	2005-09-18

One of the tightest plots and best writing styles I had seen in quite a while I indicated that it would have been one of the best fiction books of the year except for such poor editing that it only received an average review.  It appears that his editing problems are resolved with another publisher and his strong style shows through in this novel as well.  The scene is set on Black Monday, October 19, 1987.  As the stock market crashes and bank after bank collapses the hero, Stan Turner, is asked to unravel a small IRS problem for an FBI agent. Unfortunately, this starts his problems as he is caught up in a fight between the FBI and the CIA.  With a multitude of well-crafted sub-plots and a writing style that keeps the reader glued to the book, William Manchee has really crafted a masterpiece of mystery.  Always keeping the reader guessing though each twist and turn this is one of the most exciting novels I've read this year.  Black Monday is highly recommended to everyone who enjoys passing the evening with a good mystery.	2005-09-18

In total it contains 256 guidelines for coding, layout, name selection, program decomposition, modularity, error handling, testing, and debugging among many others.  The section on code formatting is extremely useful and follows the conventions taught in most degree programs in programming.  If it is followed exactly then it is much easier to understand the program and what each section is doing nine months later when you have to change something and can't remember the purpose of many of the code lines.  This, of course, makes the code much easier to maintain and allows the assignment of programming different sections to other people.  The author ends the book with several very useful appendixes including one that lists most of the more useful modules and utilities available for Perl.  Perl Best Practices is highly recommended for all Perl Programmers but especially so for new ones or ones who need to set a standard for coding.	2005-09-18

That is the question at the core of this book as the authors lead the reader through a process that measures, manages, and profits from innovation.  They make the case that management of innovation depends on the right corporate culture as well as the right employees.  When it becomes a part of the corporate culture then innovation can be a regular part of the planning process instead of an erratic thing that occurs occasionally and can't be planned for.  Using a tried and true method they detail how to bring about this culture and the factors that defeat it as well as encourage it.  Once innovation learns to thrive within your organization it can be used to differentiate your product or service and its perceived value.  Insightful with lots of illustrations, sidebars, and other information that helps the reader understand the process, Making Innovation Work is recommended.	2005-09-18

They include many techniques that are not found in most other texts and that by itself makes this a valuable book.  The authors do make the assumption that the reader already has some knowledge of relational databases and how they should work.<br /><br />The book starts by examining business requirements and how software is developed from an initial requirements assessment through object and data modeling, diagramming, and completing the design of the database.  The second chapter details indexing and how to use it efficiently to increase data lookup speed.  The third chapter provides a detailed discussion of transaction processing.  These three chapters form the foundation on which the deeper discussions in later chapters are all based.<br /><br />One of the areas that I have not found discussed in any significant detail in other books is the internal system architecture of MySQL.  In chapters 4 and 5 the authors examine the internal structure and the different storage engines and data types MySQL uses with a concentration on the InnoDB and MyISAM storage engines.  The rest of the book covers more traditional fare such as subqueries and derived tables, benchmarking and profiling, writing SQL queries that are efficient and produce the information you want, stored procedures, stored functions, views, and triggers.<br /><br />Of course they go over installation and configuration in detail as well as security, backup and restoration, replication, clustering, and troubleshooting.  The authors have included lots of illustrations, tables, and examples that really help make complex MySQL concepts easy to understand.  Pro MySQL is highly recommended for readers who already have a good understanding of MySQL past the beginners level and into the intermediate level.	2005-09-18

It includes the Linspire Live CD bundled with the book so the reader can gain experience with the Linux desktop without sacrificing their current system.  The author does a really good job of discussing why Linux has become so popular, why people are choosing it over Windows, and the advantages as well as disadvantages of Linux.  Getting down to the details he covers the KDE desktop and how to use the File Manager as well as configure the desktop.  And, of course, the reader can follow along by booting up the Linspire CD.  He also covers the most common tasks for the desktop user including setting up an Internet connection, a network connection, browsing with the included Firefox browser, setting up email with Mozilla, working with OpenOffice, using GAIM, burning CDs, playing music, downloading Linux distributions, and installing Linux (in case you want it permanently installed onto your system).<br /><br />While the average desktop user will probably not care, the author does include several appendixes for the more advanced user who really wants to know how to do more advanced things.  This book is devoted to the graphical user interface of a desktop version of Linux.  As such it does not get into the powerful use of Linux as a server other than at a cursory level.  This is a great introduction to Linux that will make you comfortable with it before making any switch.  Peter van der Linden's Guide to Linux is highly recommended.	2005-09-18

Among these women are Eve, Noah's wife, Sarah, Hagar, Tamar, Hannah, Esther, Mary of Nazareth, Mary Magdelene, and the Women of Phillipi.

The difference is the completely different writing style.  This book is written like a novel that takes you on a trip through the main character's life and realization of the need to find balance.

The Big Blueberry Barf-Off will appeal to most school kids between 8 and 12 years of age.  A departure from the Goosebumps style it is a good read filled with descriptions of the gross and messy stuff children that age like to read about while still providing an interesting story with plenty of twists and turns.

This is a very difficult time with many specialized problems.  This book walks the reader through some of the most important problems they will have to deal with including gaining perspective, discovering when your parents have a hidden agenda, and dealing with problems of communication.  It even includes information on the very difficult problems of transferring authority from the parent to the child, changing living arrangements, driving, remarriage and planning for death.  Of course all of this is very helpful information but the one thing books like this tend to overlook is the importance of taking care of yourself as well as your parent.  The authors here do not miss that detail but emphasize it's importance as an integral part of your planning.<br /><br />Some of the issues discussed in this section include how to deal with the problems in a caring and yet professional manner, dealing with guilt, anxiety, non-appreciative parents, getting other family members to help, health issues, finances, and emotional struggles.  Even the appendix is unusually helpful and contains many resources for the elderly as well as for children dealing with elderly parents.  This is required reading for anyone caring for the elderly in addition to people who will have to care for their parents at some point.  Read it and be prepared for what will be one of the most emotionally gratifying and emotionally trying times of your life. Caring for Your Aging Parents is highly recommended.	2005-09-17

After reading the book I found it very enjoyable but not at all what I had expected.  I had expected it to be a New Age book about various fatherly spirits.  A quick check with others to see what they thought the book would be about based solely on the title and everyone came up with similar comments.  Noone was even close.  Notwithstanding the poor title (which does make sense once you read the book), if you miss it you will miss an excellent read.  Author Gerry Murak has put together the stories of several people who share specific incidents in their lives where their father taught them an important life skills lesson.  The stories provide insight into some of the best examples of excellent fathering and nurturing that I have ever read.  If you've had a great father in your life you will find stories here to remind you of him.  If you didn't then here is your chance to learn what makes a good father and how good a father you can be.  Our Fathers Who Art In Heaven is highly recommended and an excellent gift for a new father or anyone missing theirs.	2005-09-17

While there are lots of people and businesses that are glad to tell you the secrets of how to get into one of the top positions on a search engine most of them are old techniques that don't work any more.  In this book the authors examine the details of how a search engine really works and basic search marketing methods.  One of the most interesting parts of the book is a section on understanding how a person thinks when they are issuing a search query.  There is also a great graphic on the relationships between many of the search engines.<br /><br />The process they outline is simple yet very powerful if followed.  First you have to identify the goals of your web site.  If you don't know what you are trying to accomplish then you are unlikely to accomplish it.  Then you determine how to measure the success of your website.  After this you develop a search marketing strategy and how you are going to measure the success of your marketing efforts.  If you are in a larger company the authors even include a section on selling your search marketing proposal to your company.<br /><br />The book includes a lot of the necessary details to implement your plan.  This includes how to get your site indexed, choosing your target words, and attracting links to your site.  This is some of the best, most detailed information that I have seen anywhere on this subject and shows that the authors are up to date in their understanding of how search engines work and how to get top rankings.

Unfortunately just because it is everywhere doesn't mean that there are not a lot of problems with it.  Learning how to deal with all those annoying problems is the purpose of this book.  The author covers installation problems, dealing with multiple versions, moving Word to another computer, dealing with long startup times, when it runs slowly, when it takes a long time to close, modifying the toolbar, saving all open documents at once, keeping separate versions of the same document, dealing with crashes and document corruption, transferring your auto-correct entries to another computer, the myriad problems of working with styles and layouts, printing problems (and there are many of these), mail merge, and even dealing with problems specific to the Mac OS.<br /><br />Written in a question and answer format it contains all the most commonly asked questions about how to get Word to work the way you want.  I've worked with Word for years and still found a couple of tips in this book that I really appreciated.

Although it is understandable that sometimes dealing with children can cause a parent to lose their cool and scream at the children this is not the preferred response.  Screaming is a reaction and not a purposeful and appropriate course of action.  Taking control of yourself and your job as a parent is what this book is about.  The author is realistic and recognizes that even the best parents struggle with the tendency to react instead of act with purpose.  The difference between these scream free parents and others is that they learn to control that tendency to react and choose a more appropriate course of action.  The book is delightfully realistic and insightful and points out some of the normal conundrums of raising children.  Well written and engaging, a combination that is hard to find in this style of book, you will find familiar situations consistently throughout the book.  Scream Free Parenting is a recommended read for parents with children of all ages.	2005-09-17

But Samba has grown up as a full-fledged package for communicating between Linux and Windows over the last few years.  Installing Samba as a Primary Domain Controller, implementing ldap for easy directory integration, or just installing it as a file and print server are all easy to do with the help of this book.  The author takes a much easier to follow approach than most other writers on this subject.  Instead of trying to go through each of the features and discuss them in detail he organizes the book by the type of installation and then walks you through a correct setup for that situation.  For example some of the sections are: No-frills Samba Servers, Small Office Networking, Secure Office Networking, The 500-User Office, A Distributed 2000-User Network, Migrating NT4 Domain to Samba-3, and Migrating Netware Server to Samba-3.  For each one of these situations the author dissects the technical issues, discusses each one, and then walks the reader through the implementing.  The author also includes sections on things like performance, reliability, LDAP, and updating Samba.  Nothing is left unexplained but each time you are told to check something or do something the exact syntax for doing it is given.  Even with only very little or no Linux experience you can walk through this book and install a correctly functioning Samba server.  Samba-3 by Example is highly recommended.	2005-09-17

For them knowing how to get down to the command line and get things done that either the graphical interface does not allow or does not do the way you want it done is a matter of pride and represents the dividing line between a user and a power user.  If you want to become a real Linux guru and know how to work the command line to do whatever you want including commands, editing, shell programming, and scripting this is one of the better books available.  Readable, straight-forward, educational, it is a one-of-kind reference that blends the educational aspect of a typical book on learning Linux with a typical book of command line references.  A Practical Guide to Linux is highly recommended.	2005-09-17

These people and companies take advantage of the child's age and innocence to mold their minds.  The problem is not only that this is unethical but that over time it creates permanent changes in the child and alters their personality as well as their health.  The bottom line here is that marketers will always target our children as yet another tool to be used to sell product.  As such it is the responsibility of the parents to control the factors that influence their children for good and bad.  The authors separate the sections of the book to include what is appropriate for birth to age three, three to seven, eight to twelve, thirteen to fifteen, and sixteen to nineteen.  For each of these age groups they cover developmental issues, areas to watch and areas where you can expand their exposure to the world and difficult issues.  You may disagree, as I did, with some of the detail but overall it is an insightful and interesting read.  Even if you don't agree with all of it you are sure to find the greatest part of Kidnapped highly informative and helpful for raising children.  As such it is a recommended read.	2005-09-17

Part of the reason is the choice of the Xandros distribution of Linux as the included distribution.  For those not familiar with Xandros it is one of the most popular of the desktop versions because the focus is on a user-friendly implementation.  The author provides the details on installation and goes into much more detail than most similar books.  He follows that with the basics of how to use the various included programs as well as how to download and install other popular ones.  This book contains lots of good, detailed information on customizing your system, adding printers, interfacing with your PDA, using the contact manager, surfing the Internet, setting email, working with music files, working with DVDs, working with the office productivity suite (OpenOffice), and even playing games.  Because of the attention to detail and very non-technical writing style this is probably one of the best choices for the completely new user who wants to install and use Linux as their primary desktop OS.<br /><br />These days one of the first questions people ask about a book with a Linux distribution included is whether it is a LiveCD that can run without installing to the hard drive.  That is not the case with this Linux distribution.  It must be installed to the hard drive but can be installed in a dual boot configuration.  In my case I had a problem installing it but contacted the publicist who was very helpful and sent another copy of the disk.  Xandros provides no support for the Open Circulation edition and so it was necessary to contact the publisher.  From the new disk it installed easily, found all the hardware, correctly configured everything that it should and was an absolute thing of beauty to see if you've ever worked your way through an installation of Linux from scratch before.  This version of Linux found all of my Windows shares automatically, setup networking automatically, and just plain worked just like the book said it would.  If you are new to Linux and want a friendly desktop version to learn how it works on the desktop then this book will provide everything you need to install and use Xandros and some of the most commonly used software programs.  Linux Made Easy is highly recommended for the person new to Linux who wants to learn about Linux on the desktop and has the hard drive free space available to install it.ing automatically, and just plain worked just like the book said it would.

I do a lot of data parsing and this book is one of the best finds I have ever made.  I should point out, however, that it is not for the average reader.  This book is very technical in nature but absolutely fabulous if you are technically inclined or already proficient in Perl or have some experience parsing using another language.  It seems that I am always finding strange problems that create a need to parse large amounts of data to extract only the relevant information and present it in a usable form.  Author Christopher M. Frenz covers the whole gamut of parsing and does so in a very logical progressive manner.  First he starts with the use of regular expressions and does a great job including some complex example of just what can be done.  From there he moves to generative grammars and how they can be used to determine relevant data of interest within a text, XML or similar file.  Then from there he builds on your understanding by discussing specialized modules that can be added to your Perl implementation and how they are used.  And, of course, he discusses data mining and how to efficiently use this information.  This is an excellent technical book that is a required resource for anyone using Perl to parse documents.  Pro Perl Parsing is highly recommended.	2005-09-17

With this should come responsibility and learning how to spend or save wisely.  The problem is that most just learn to spend as soon as they get it, get it by begging parents or an allowance with no responsibilities involved or similar.  Enter Janet Bodnar, deputy-editor of Kiplinger's Personal Finance, mother of three, and writer of the Money Smart Kids column in Kiplinger Magazine.  This is not a collection of hard and fast rules to force good finance habits onto kids but a framework within which parents can use good common sense to handle any situation.  The book starts with a quiz to test your money smarts.  This quiz is excellent and presents most of the potential situations you are likely to encounter with children and money.  The author even includes examples of questions kids ask and how to answer them.  One of the insightful sections is one on how kids think about money and how to deal with these concepts from preschool to teenager.  Ms. Bodnar even includes a fascinating chapter on questions and answers about money's history, composition, and dozens of other miscellaneous facts.  Prepare your children to know how to deal with money when they are grown.  Raising Money Smart Kids is highly recommended.	2005-09-17

This book is not a grammar book with all those rules on how to make your work syntactically correct.  Instead it takes a larger view and supplies the basics of writing well.  For example the \\"ground rules\\" include checking to make sure the story is organized well and and checking that paragraphs have a topic sentence that the rest of the paragraph relates to.  For each of the ground rules the authors discuss how to check your work to see that it conforms to the rules and how to change it so it does.<br /><br />The section starting on page 33 is a welcome change from most writing books.  The authors suggest that you should identify areas where you have problems and include them on a check list of editing problems to watch for.  But, how do you know your problem areas if you don't see the problem?  This section gives several examples of sentences with various problems.  Find the ones where you don't see a problem, go to the answers section that explains the problem and you have your short list of items to learn about and watch for in your work.<br /><br />For the person looking to raise their writing quality to a higher level of professionalism Write It Right is a recommended read.	2005-08-28

A master of the interview, its host Brian Lamb has had over 750 guest authors on the program.  In this book he has collected seventy selected pieces that reveal some aspect about the people, politics, and conflict of American history.  Sometimes the articles contain interesting viewpoints, sometimes they fill in gaps in our education, and other times they are quite controversial.  Each article is absorbing reading and covers a wide variety of topics including Benjamin Franklin, the Disputed Election of 1876, Carrie Nation, the Rise of Conservatism, Libertarianism, the Civil War, World Wars, Vietnam War, Child Molestation in the Early 1980s, Sinclair Lewis, Tupac Shakur, and Presidential Rhetoric.

Moodle is an open source course management system that can handle anything from a single course through a university system with thousands of students and courses.

This book provides the reader with all the background and detail information they need to install and configure the software as well as and setup your courses.  I was able to follow the book and setup a course and test it easily enough.  It wasn't perfect the first time through but I did get it working correctly without having to refer to any other source of documentation.<br /><br />Although installation is traditionally done on an Linux Apache system it will work on most systems that have a webserver, PHP, and SQL database.

In addition to the things you would expect to find in a book like this (star names, constellations, Messier objects, etc.) the authors also cover things like etiquette when observing with groups, how to choose binoculars and the right telescope for you.  The tips on how to choose the right telescope and how to avoid being cheated is well worth the price of the book by itself.<br /><br />Of course it is filled with information on identifying stars and constellations, using the celestial coordinate system, observing in different environments, observing shallow-space and deep-space objects, and photographing the stars.  But the tips on things like eliminating astigmatism, eliminating diffraction, and tuning your telescope are some of the most interesting as well as the most likely to make your hobby really enjoyable.

So, I didn't really know what I was missing until I read through this book and tried the myriad of little tricks detailed throughout.  Yahoo has grown up and is a serious competitor to other search engines as well as a preferred site for some purposes.  Author Randolph Hock introduces the reader to the details of various services of Yahoo including Groups, News, Mail, Messenger, GeoCities, Chat, Message Boards, Shopping, Auctions, Classifieds, and Finance.  If that isn't enough he includes information on how to use Yahoo's city guides, maps, weather, people search, and lots of other useful stuff.  Have you ever been to a website that did not have a search function?  I've been to a lot of them.  The author details how to deal with these situations using Yahoo and including site:[...] on the search line.  When you do this it just searches that site!  Or if you want to find all the sites that link to another site you can use the link syntax in the search box.  I did that and it returned eight links.  Surprisingly I did the same thing on Google and it only returned four and only one of them was the same in both engines.  A couple of more searches following the instructions in the book and I was surprised to find that in several instances Yahoo returned more relevant results than my old favorite Google.  With lots of details on how to use Yahoo effectively, Yahoo to the Max is a highly recommended book which has convinced me that I can often get the results I am looking for more easily from Yahoo than from competitors.	2005-08-28

If you are already familiar with version control software you will be pleasantly surprised to find that the author not only details how to use it to its greatest benefit but also includes information on its limitations and workarounds for specific situations.<br /><br />After the introductory and general background information the author jumps right into installation and setup.  From there he first examines the use of Subversion from the user's standpoint and then from the administrator's perspective.  The administrative part includes an excellent section on using scripts.  The next part examines the software development process and not only includes using Subversion in the development process and several case studies, but also an excellent section on best practice policies.  The last section of the book is a detailed technical reference that includes a detailed command reference.  If you do software development of any type you will want to use a version control system.

With a straight-forward analysis of Internet telephony as compared to traditional phone lines and the various options available, this book is well done and very informative.  I happen to use one of the services mentioned in the book and found the author's review of it right on the mark.  He provided an excellent discussion of the differences between a broadband phone-centric service and a computer-centric service as well as the offerings of specific vendors.  If you are thinking about making the move to Internet telephony this book will provide you with sufficient background information to determine if it would be useful for your needs as well as how to shop intelligently for the appropriate product.

The original articles are repeated verbatim complete with comments, misspellings, and colloquial word usage.  I found this to be one of the endearing qualities of the book.  The author takes a very broad look at unnatural phenomena and includes everything from strange things falling from the sky, to strange apparitions, animals, visions, and just about anything else you can think of that has been reported over the last two hundred years.  While it is interesting reading it is not a book that I would suggest if you are looking to do a serious study of strange phenomena.  On the other hand, if you are just looking for some light reading and a collection of incidents as reported by the media you will probably find this an entertaining read.  The articles are all arranged by state instead of by type of phenomena so it is easy to look through your state and see what has been reported over the years.  Unnatural Phenomena: A Guide to the Bizarre Wonders of North America is a recommended read for anyone interested in this subject or light enough reading for the merely curious.	2005-08-28

The book does include a CD but it is somewhat disappointing.  It contains mostly demo programs that give you only a taste of the product and a few public domain tools that you are likely to have anyway if you do even a modicum of computer security work.  The nicest thing about the CD is the inclusion of various checklists to help make sure you follow good forensic procedures.  As such the target audience for this book is people who need basic forensic skills and the knowledge to develop an IT security strategy.<br /><br />The book starts with a solid overview of computer forensics technology and how the field has changed over the last several years.  The author does a good job of covering computer evidence issues and the special issues associated with the Windows operating system.  This introduction is followed with sections dealing with Internet security, intrusion detection, firewalls, storage area networks security, disaster recovery, public key infrastructure security, wireless network security, satellite encryption, instant messenger, ID management, ID theft, biometrics, and homeland security.<br /><br />The author also discusses several specific vendor tools that can be used as well as policies that should be used to document and prosecute an attack.  This section includes a discussion of appropriate incident responses, evidence collection, forensic analysis, expert witnessing, forensic litigation, and insurance support.  While the book provides an excellent base of knowledge to the reader in the area of evidence collection the reader should also be aware that the legal and technical environment changes quickly.<br /><br />If you believe your computer has been attacked or otherwise need to prove something did or did not occur, this book's shining point is the excellent job it does on evidence collection and preservation.  This is an area where many business owners and technical users get into trouble.  Incorrectly checking the system for signs of the attack or other illegal information often makes the data unusable in a court of law.  You must follow specific procedures to protect the original evidence and work on a copy.  All the details of the correct procedure is presented clearly in this book.

Readers who already understand the basics of filtering and email analysis will find it both easy and educational to read.<br /><br />The author includes an excellent section on spammer tricks and how they get past fileters as well as what to do about it.

The Enthusiastic Employee examines how you can make a company profitable by creating enthusiastic employees.

They propose that over time managers often kill the enthusiasm of employees and then describe what to do about it.<br /><br />The authors provide a close examination of motivational factors in the workplace including job security, compensation, respect, a sense of achievement, challenge, feedback, recognition, and feeling you are part of a team.

What is degunking?  Whether you have just installed a system from scratch or inherited an already running system there are always programs, services, and configuration options that can be removed or changed to clean up your system.  By cleaning it up you can get it to work more efficiently and leave it less prone to exploitation by others.<br /><br />The author does a thorough job of examining most of the common program and configuration items that can clutter up a Linux system.  Not just the Linux system itself, the book also examines configuration and of common applications like OpenOffice, Mozilla, and Evolution.  There are much more detailed books on removing processes and default configuration options on the market, but they are generally under the heading of security and too advanced for the novice user.  On the other hand, this book is written for the novice to intermediate user and really stands head and shoulders above other books for this particular group.  In addition this book contains a good section on optimizing your X configuration, which can really improve your graphic performance.  Degunking Linux is highly recommended for novice to intermediate users.	2005-07-31

In it the authors detail how to start or buy a retail business as well as how to revive a failing one.  This is not just another book on retail theories. Arthur Rubinfeld has worked with the likes of Starbucks, Oakley, Gateway, and many other highly successful retailers.  Co-author Collins Hemmingway also co-authored Bill Gates' best selling book Business @ the Speed of Thought.<br /><br />The authors provide a step-by-step process focusing on all aspects of a successful retail business including branding, location, employees, customers, finance, and business planning.  The book is well organized and follows the normal business growth model from planning and implementing your first store through expansion to using innovation as a way to grow beyond the limits of your current product line or customer profile.  Of course such a book would not be thorough if it didn't include information on pitfalls to avoid and the authors do not disappoint the reader in this area either.  With solid advice in how to be a success in your retail business Built for Growth is a recommended read.	2005-07-31

That is the basic premise of this book and the author makes a compelling argument while also providing a blueprint for how to adapt to this change.  One of the ways that the market has changed drastically is the level of education of the consumer.  With the Internet and easy access to information on your company, competitors, and even opinions from your clients or competitors the customer can find out anything they need to know about you or your company.<br /><br />Instead of selling the potential customer we need to be an advocate for them.  That means telling them not only the good things about your service or product but also the weaknesses.  Being up front about everything builds trust and trust builds loyal customers.  Throughout the book the author argues that by building trust the customer advocate gains several major benefits.  Among these are reduced customer acquisition costs, higher profit margins, and a long-term competitive edge.  I particularly appreciated the fact that the author followed his own advice and pointed out industries where advocacy makes the biggest difference and where advocacy is unlikely to make much difference.  Don't Just Relate - Advocate is a highly recommended read and should be required reading for anyone involved in regular contact with your customers or potential customers.	2005-06-25

Unfortunately, these same people can quite easily turn to one of the many incidents of our time where religion has also been used to harm others.<br /><br />In her book God vs. The Gavel author Marci Hamilton argues that the church, while being allowed to perform their purpose and service in the world, should also be subject to the rule of law that they should cause no harm.  The author takes a well-argued position that there should be some limit on religious freedom when it harms others.  Examples include the child who can easily be treated for a life-threatening illness but is not due to the religious beliefs of the parents, or the family that moves into a quiet residential neighborhood but then finds a church starting in the house next door followed by houses demolished to make a large parking lot, etc.  Some of the issues are not as far reaching as these and include such matters as allowing a beard to military personnel whose religion specifies it, or kosher food for a Jewish inmate in a prison.  There are many, many of these places where the interests of the state and the church intersect.<br /><br />This book is a call to all of us, including religious practitioners, to practice our religion as we will as long as it harms nobody else.  The author's arguments are firmly grounded in the First Amendment and the intent of its framers.  Brilliantly argued, although many will have difficulty with the idea of accountability to anyone other than the local church, God vs. The Gavel is recommended reading.	2005-06-25

Educational and interesting	One of the best reads of the year, The Washing Machine details how various banks, politicians, terrorists groups, black market dealers, and others launder illegal money to give the appearance of coming from legitimate enterprises.  The author is not shy about naming specific banks, groups, and techniques that have been used and follows the money trail from beginning to end.  Some of the companies and groups mentioned include the Bank of New York, the Russian Mafia, Al Qaida, and offshore financial entities in Ireland, Turkey, Sri Lanka and other places.  The final chapters deal with what the various countries and law enforcement are doing today to help curb the problem.

This is a difficult position to understand for many people.  At the crux of the problem is the question of why a God who wishes all to come to salvation then selects those whom He will save.  In this book the author takes on this question and argues a pro-Calvinist position.  She does a thorough job and even addresses corollary questions such as whether it really makes a difference if we evangelize if God has already determine who will be saved.  Although it is a small book the author does provide an excellent exposition of the Calvinist point of view.  God's Will and God's Desire is recommended to those who are of the Calvinist persuasion or who want to better understand that position.	2005-06-25

Author Chris F. A. Johnson provides an extensive education on scripting including scripts for viewing, editing, and manipulating files, manipulating strings, altering the path variable, monitoring the file system, filtering spam, backing up, archiving, deleting, and many other common tasks.  How far can you go with a shell script?  He even gives a working example of a database application written completely in script.  On the other hand if you just want to have some fun there are even scripts for creating anagrams, fitting words into a crossword, or finding words that contain a given set of characters.<br /><br />While the book is really written for the technically oriented reader, even the very basics that most users should already know are still covered.  The format is more typical of what computer technicians want - this is the item to be discussed, this is how it works, this is an example, move on to the next one.  When I am looking for answers this is the format I prefer and I found this book extremely useful.  It will be on my bookshelf as one of the first to grab when I want to do scripting in Linux.  Advanced and powerful, a real resource for the power user of the Bourne shell, Shell Scripting Recipes is highly recommended.	2005-06-25

In a company where career paths can be sidetracked quickly by not supporting your superior it is the only answer to give.  As a result there is no legitimate feedback for management decision making.  This is the problem addressed by author Michael A. Roberto.<br /><br />Mr. Roberto proposes that great leaders develop a culture of conflict and consensus at the same time.  Of course conflict must be created in a constructive nature and kept constructive.  The problem is how to effectively deal with a lack of candor and stimulate a clash of ideas while keeping it constructive.  Chapter three is one of the best ones in my opinion and the author does an especially good job of discussing the factors that keep dialog from being candid and the barriers to expressing and discussing dissenting opinions.  Chapters 4 and 5 looks at the art of how to stimulate an increase in conflict and voice a dissenting opinion without seeming to be difficult.  Of course once you have these conflicting ideas out in the open you have to somehow come to a consensus.  Why Great Leaders Don't Take Yes for an Answer is a recommended for all business people but especially for those who utilize committees and boards for direction.	2005-06-25

In fact, the authors of this book suggest that everyone has an innate moral compass and the moral intelligence to know what is right and wrong.  What the leaders lack when they engage in questionable or blatantly illegal actions is the moral capacity to follow that compass.<br /><br />The second part of the book was the most interesting to me.  In it the authors examine how to develop the skills to apply moral intelligence in the real world.  They examine several areas of ethics including integrity, responsibility, compassion, forgiveness, and emotions.  The final part of the book deals with moral leadership and how it can be used to create a morally intelligent company.<br /><br />The bottom line is that those who can apply moral intelligence keep their moral compass, their goals, and their behavior in alignment in everything they do.  By realizing that success and moral action are not mutually exclusive they have become some of the most successful people in the world.  The authors even include a moral competency inventory in the appendixes which can be used to help determine where you and your company stand currently.  Moral Intelligence is highly recommended to all business leaders whether a foreman over just a few people or a CEO leading thousands.	2005-06-25

Throughout the book he dispenses the rules of courtesy when dining out but does so with a humorous and very entertaining style.  Mr. Galloway provides a lot of insight into the inner workings of a restaurant including how the server quickly determines who will be a good customer and who will not, often before they are even seated.  Don't like the level of service you receive?  He also discusses how to be treated like royalty at your favorite restaurant.  Although written predominantly for the patron of the true upper scale fine dining restaurant much of the advice is also applicable to the average restaurant.  Fine Dining Madness is an eye-opening, and fun read recommended for everyone.	2005-06-25

As a result you can test drive Linux without any concerns about your current system integrity.<br /><br />The book covers the popular KDE desktop environment, using virtual desktops, change backgrounds, the Konqueror web browser, playing music and videos, games, email, using the organizer, and Instant Messaging.  It also includes a section on using Gimp, an image editor similar to Photoshop, and OpenOffice, the suite of word processor, spreadsheet, database, and presentation software that many prefer to Microsoft's Office suite.<br /><br />This is an excellent introduction to Linux and how to use it on a daily basis.  It does not cover the details that a power user might want but it does cover everything an average desktop user would want to know.  It also includes a good selection of programs so you can see what can be done with Linux.  Just keep in mind that you are running them off the CD and so it runs much slower that it would if installed on the hard drive.  While it is designed to allow the novice to experience Linux, if you already know a little about Linux you can mount up your Windows hard drive and work on the files on it.  Test Driving Linux is an excellent book for the novice Linux user or anyone who wants to try the Operating System without committing to it right away.	2005-06-25

In 1801 Tripoli declared war on the United States.

When a Navy ship was captured and all on board taken for slaves Thomas Jefferson had to decide whether to pay the ransom or engage the nation's very small Navy in a war.  Enter William Eaton, a failed military officer who, for various reasons, President Jefferson asks to engage in covert operations to remove the leader from power.  This is the story behind the first covert operations of the United States long before the CIA ever came into existence.

Using standard writing techniques almost ensures that readers will have a difficult time understanding technical material.  This book comes to the rescue of the technical writer by detailing the proper techniques and the things you need to take into consideration when writing.  For example, nobody would argue that a technical book written for people with a doctorate degree should be very different from a technical manual written for the complete novice.  So, knowing your intended audience is one of the most important places to start when writing technical material.<br /><br />Section 2 covers the basics of writing including passive versus active voice, sentence structure, dealing with pronouns, working with lists, tables, and graphics and many more detailed pieces of information for writing.  Section 3 then applies that information to the accepted layout of specific kinds of documents including manuals, web sites, proposals, internal planning documents, lab reports, PowerPoint presentations, and even e-mail.  The last section covers the basics of editing.<br /><br />This book is one of the best I have reviewed on this subject.

Casual	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Great advice for the corporate employee	The last paragraph of the introduction to this book clearly defines the objective - \\"...to help you discover how to present a professional image and conduct yourself with professional manner that transcends appearances\\".  With the advent of \\"business casual\\" the perceived separation of the management from the worker by virtue of dress was greatly diminished.  The problem is that it has also caused many employees and management to also take a much more casual attitude toward business.  What is \\"business casual\\" and how can you draw the line that makes dress business casual without making the employees too casual about the business?  Author April Callis tackles this question as she examines what constitutes a professional image, making a great first impression, proper business attire, business etiquette, interviewing skills, and presentation skills.  Each of these areas are presented from the standpoint of creating the right image right from the start.  Springboard to Success is required reading for people new to the office environment (especially high-school and college graduates) and recommended to those who are moving up the corporate ladder.	2005-06-25

Not content to just dive right into PostgreSQL and how to us it, the authors include a lot of database history and theory that is sadly lacking from similar books.  But it is not just for beginners.  The authors include more advances sections on things like accessing the database using C, PHP, Perl, Java, and C#.<br /><br />Between this beginning user and advanced user level the authors fill in all the intermediate parts so the book ends up providing a well-organized education from the principles of database design through database setup, query, ODBC access setup, and using a programming or scripting language to accessing and updating the database.  The book also includes detailed information on selection procedures, data manipulation, functions, stored procedures, triggers, and PostgreSQL Administration.  As a result you end up with a book where the database theory applies to all relational databases and as it becomes more technical in nature it moves from there to information specific to PostgreSQL for the advanced user, administrator, or programmer.  Beginning Databases with PostgreSQL, Second Edition is highly recommended to anyone interested in using this particular SQL engine.	2005-06-25

The authors examine things like the major and minor scales, fifths, sevenths, melodies, sightsinging, triads, and diatonic progressions.  They also do an excellent job of describing what is happening, the theory behind it and how to use it to help train your ears to recognize the notes, progressions, etc.  The book includes exercises, answer sheets, and two CDs with examples of the various notes and tones from the book so you can practice.

From an examination of system requirements, performance factors, and external interfaces it moves the reader along to how to connect your computer to your stereo including the good and bad features of different interfaces.<br /><br />Of course, once the hardware has been selected and configured correctly the next obvious place to go is to examine the software and that is exactly what Bruce and Marty Fries do.  They cover ways to organize your music, get music off the web, using Internet radio, using portable digital audio players, and many other ways to get the most out of your system.<br /><br />In the more technical sections of the book the authors examine things like audio formats, recording, ripping, editing, digitizing records and tapes, burning CDs and CVDs and fixing various common programs.  They even include a section on making your own Internet Radio Station.<br /><br />This is the basically the essentials of what a novice to intermediate fan of digital audio needs to know.  The most advanced portion of the book is on using a waveform program to remove the hiss and pop of a bad recording.  It does not cover advanced topics like mixing, combining, and using multiple tracks.  Digital Audio Essentials is highly recommended for the novice to intermediate digital audio fan and just recommended to the more advanced user.  It is, after all, only intended to be an essentials book and not an advanced treatise and it succeeds well at achieving that goal.	2005-06-12

While Firefox is a better browser in many ways, it is not without its problems.  For example, occasionally you run across a website that is poorly written and has sections that are specific to Microsoft Explorer and Microsoft update will only allow Explorer to use the update feature.<br /><br />So, why change from Internet Explorer?  Even with the newer versions it always seems to be a step or two behind other Internet browsers.  Firefox is wonderfully convenient with tabbed browsing, better support for web standards, greater user control, and security that is so much better than Explorer as to make Explorer security appear to be non-existent.  It has better pop-up blocking and far fewer infections from spyware and other malicious code.  Since switching two years ago and adding GhostSurf I have not had any spyware or other infections.  I spend a lot of time on the Internet and would become infested on an almost daily basis, but not anymore.<br /><br />This book is designed for the person who wants to make the switch or wants to try out Firefox.  Firefox can run alongside with Internet Explorer so you can learn how to use it while still having the ability to use Internet Explorer's update service and similar Microsoft only items.  The authors do a good job of explaining how to setup Firefox, how to use it effectively and even how to tweak it with extensions so it works the way you want it to work.  \\"Don't Click on the Blue e!\\" is highly recommended and an excellent resource for people looking to improve their browsing experience.	2005-06-12

Here to rescue the newbie is a compendium of terms and definitions from the world of business.  Besides general jargon that is common among most businesses like alpha dog and peanut gallery it includes terms specific to particular industries such as Investments, Accounting and Tax, Debt and Banking, Legal, Real Estate, Insurance, Contracts, Business Planning, Acquisitions, and Divestitures.  This is fascinating reading with lots of terms I've heard before and even more that are entirely new to me.  Done in an interesting style that leaves you unable to put the book down as you read entry after entry it is a fun and informative read.  Green Weenies and Due Diligence is highly recommended for anyone in the business world who wants to understand the slang used in their industry.	2005-06-09

Most of the books on the market that laud the merits of open source programs are directed at the technically oriented user.  This book provides management with the information they need to determine if they should investigate the use of open source software in their business.  It includes actual case studies including the specific software products used and a cost savings analysis as well as how to calculate the Total Cost of Ownership if you are looking at making a change away from Windows products.<br /><br />The book contains almost no technical jargon.  It is a high-level overview of the programs available, what each one does, advantages and disadvantages, and where to find additional information.  Ms. Winslow includes information on all the most popular business applications and distributions of Linux.  She even includes information on determining when you should and should not make the switch and when a hybrid network is the most appropriate as well as how to get users and management to buy into the change.  The Practical Manager's Guide to Open Source is a great non-technical overview of open source business programs and the perfect place to start for management considering Linux in their network.	2005-06-09

The book includes a CD that demonstrates some of the lessons and warm-up exercises which is very helpful.  With a good education on how the vocal cords and diaphragm work together to produce sound as well as how to care for them properly, sing without damaging them, and a lot of other important information.  Includes a section on breathing that I wish more singers would learn - how to breath without making breathing sounds.  While nothing replaces one-on-one teaching between a student and teacher, Strengthening Your Singing Voice is a reasonable alternative and recommended.	2005-06-09

Instead of concentrating on a pretty site with the latest technology that looks great but doesn't increase your business he concentrates on building a customer experience and customer loyalty.  This is about design for the web experience and therefore your customer's perception of the value received from that experience.<br /><br />The basic process can be distilled down into three basic components: Identify the visitor, be clear as to your business objectives with that visitor, and move the visitor to reach that objective.  This is a book about designing effective web sites for business and following business fundamentals instead of worrying about an artistically designed site that looks great but does not create customers.  This is not to say that design is not important.  The author goes in depth about the importance of the site's look and feel as well as its functionality.<br /><br />One very important point should be noted here.  There are plenty of books about designing a website with your business mission in mind.  On these sites the business owner generally puts what they want the customers to want.  This is not customer focused.  Mr. Waters focuses on giving the customer what they want because what the customer perceives as value is what really counts and brings them back.  The Real Business of Web Design is highly recommended.	2005-06-09

It covers the basics of security in general (weak passwords, key logging, Trojans, network topology, etc.) as well as security issues that are specific to Linux.<br /><br />It does a good job of explaining how Iptables are used in a firewall and how to tune the network.  Linux Network Security does appear to thoroughly cover all the basic system security considerations including the passwd file, shadowing, enforcing security, using PAM, and SUDO security.  The best part of the book is when the author gets to how to choose an appropriate distribution, use a chroot jail, and protect memory.<br /><br />In addition to the basic Linux security common to all distributions the author discusses role based access control, the Linux Intrusion Detection System, and the secure Linux distribution SeLinux.  The book ends with sections on securing the most common services for Linux - Apache, SSH, NFS, NIS, DNS, BIND, and FTP.  It also includes a section on keeping your system secure using Tripwire.<br /><br />If you need additional help on specific issues there are six appendixes which cover recompiling the kernel, kernel configuration for networking, firewall scripts, and cryptography.  This book is obviously intended for the Linux network administrator, but the level of knowledge assumed is somewhat confusing.  For some pieces it seems to assume no prior knowledge (like Chapters 1 and 2) and for other areas it seems to assume some basic prior understanding of Linux  (although admittedly minimal).  Keep in mind that there are whole books on some of these items (like securing Apache) so there is obviously much more detailed information available if you have a specific need.  Linux Network Security is highly recommended to network administrators who are dealing with a basic file and print sharing network or who need a solid overview of Linux security and some of the security problems with common services.some of the security problems with common services.	2005-06-09

The author does an excellent job of being detailed without being repetitive or writing at too basic a level.  Intermediate users of Perl can find a lot here but even a novice will find sufficient explanation to allow them to learn the language from scratch.  The book is well organized and starts with an introduction to Perl followed by how to acquire and install Perl.  From there it goes right into the meat of the language with variables, operators, data types, interpolation, substitution, subroutines, regular expressions, working with files and directories, etc.  Besides the language itself the author deals with some of the common administrative tasks like adding new modules and packages.  The book ends with some advanced topics like embedding Perl and dealing with processes, signals and threads, and networking.<br /><br />At 990 pages this is a massive book that is easy to follow and full of examples to show exactly how each concept should work.  Pro Perl is highly recommended to everyone from the complete novice to advanced level Perl programmer and includes a lot of detail that I have spent hours on the Internet looking for before.	2005-06-09

Although I have worked with Linux for years there were still several tips in here that I did not know and found very useful.  Each chapter focuses on a particular area of the desktop computer and how you can make it perform the way it should or look totally different.  Some of the subjects covered include changing the Boot Manager, bypassing the Manager, redefining keys, using macros, switching users, using multiple desktops, using creative cursors, using Windows and Mac fonts, running the desktop over the Internet, sharing applications and monitors, viewing Microsoft Word Documents in a Terminal, displaying a PDF document in a terminal, reducing startup time, encrypting email, configure Firefox, forwarding ports, new user setup, link monitoring, tweaking the kernel without recompiling, using unsupported printers, and boosting hard-drive performance.

The Starving Family fills that gap by sharing the insights of various caregivers.  Eating disorders or any other kind of similar problem does not occur in isolation.  It affects and involves everyone who cares for or about the individual.  Educational, insightful, and full of encouraging advice for those dealing with this problem The Starving Family is highly recommended.	2005-06-09

The authors cover the basic security that applies to all Linux distributions such as filesystem security and creating a sandbox, and then follows up with security options specific to BSD.  The chapters cover installation, secure administration, creating a secure DNS server, secure mail servers (including Sendmail, Postfix, and qmail), secure web server, firewalls, intrusion detection, system auditing and incident response, and some forensics.  However, the forensics information provides a decent overview without being detailed enough to be very useful.<br /><br />The authors do a really good job of explaining not only how to do various tasks but also the reasoning behind it and how it works to resolve specific problems. I like the fact that the authors don't do this in a piecemeal approach but provide a pathway to get to the system hardened before heading off into the specifics of harding particular services link DNS and Sendmail.  They actually have a step by step procedure starting from a fresh install.  This alone makes this one of the better books on hardening FreeBSD and OpenBSD.  Mastering FreeBSD and OpenBSD Security is highly recommended.	2005-06-09

In this book the author does an excellent job of explaining the purpose of an enterprise cluster and exactly how they work.  Not just theory, the book details exactly how to install the various components of the system and even includes the required software on CD.<br /><br />This is the first book I have seen on Linux clustering that not only provides a theoretical background but also a complete detail on how to actually implement it in the real world.  He details setting up the heartbeat, IP failover, NAT, synchronizing and cloning, handling packets, and load balancing.  Easily the best book on Linux Enterprise Cluster setup and maintenance that I have seen to date, The Linux Enterprise Cluster is highly recommended.	2005-06-09

Hargrave's book is much more than the title would suggest.  It is about more than dealing with aging parents with Alzheimers or another mental problems where they can no longer express affection for you the way they once did.  It also examines the problems of how the need to care for aging parents may disrupt your life and plans.  How do you deal with dependent parents?  How do you deal with forgetfulness, not taking medicine, doing things they should no longer be doing, etc.  The book and the advice it contains is both practical, such as finishing up family business, and enlightening.<br /><br />The author deals with this problem in part by changing perspective and viewing the process of caring for aging parents as a spiritual journey that you undertake.  He also looks from the perspective of the parent - trying to deal with declining health, a lack of independence, and other normal changes that come with age.<br /><br />One particularly valuable aspect of the book is that it provides a clear vision of areas that need to be discussed and dealt with as parents age.  These areas include legal and financial decisions, how much care is needed, when it needs to be done, by whom it should be done, various living options, depression, dementia, alzheimer's disease, dealing with a parent who has been unkind, and accepting and planning for death.  Loving Your Parents When They Can No Longer Love You is highly recommended for anyone dealing with aging parents and the life changes that come about as a result.	2005-05-03

Free Gulliver: Six Swift Lessons in Life Planning plays on Jonathan Swift's book Gulliver's Travels and his experience with the residents of Lilliput.  Although small in size and Gulliver is huge in comparison the Lilliputians succeed in keeping him under control.  They do it by using thousands of small strings, each of which are small enough for him to break easily but when combined they hold him fast to the ground.  This is the premise of this book and its whole purpose.  We tend to let so many small things tie us down that in total we become incapacitated.  This book is about freeing Gulliver - freeing yourself from all those little things that hold you back.  Although he details the process in this book the basic premise it to figure out your vision of where you want to go and then cut the strings that hold you.  Free Gulliver: Six Swift Lessons in Life Planning is highly recommended to people who feel overwhelmed to the point of being almost unable to cope with life or unable to move forward toward their goals.	2005-05-03

One of the difficulties for many people who study the Bible is the fact that it is not organized chronologically but the historical books often cover the same period (i.e. 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles) or are organized by the length of the book (major prophets vs. minor prophets) or other ways.  This is a unique way of presenting the complete Bible story that brings pattern and structure to all the disconnected stories we tend to learn in church.<br /><br />Others have taken the Bible and organized it into chronological order before but generally they have produced a paraphrased story and not a translation.  What makes this book unique is that they have retained the translation so it is still a good study Bible.  I recommend The Story as the best chronological Bible available today because it stays as true as possible to being a translation that has just had the chapters and verses reorganized to make it a single story.	2005-05-03

To resolve this problem Nancy Fayrweather Bailey has come up with a recipe for a low-carbohydrate substitute for flour that can be used in most recipes for a surprisingly good result.  The flour substitute is called MixQuick and contains soy flour and oat flour to increase the protein count while greatly reducing the carbohydrate count.  Recipes in the book include pancakes, souffl&eacute;s, muffins, quiche, lasagna, pizza, and burritos.<br /><br /> The MixQuick is the base for all the recipes and while I only tried making one unit of the MixQuick and two recipes the results were surprisingly good.  These are low-carbohydrate recipes that I could live with.  Have Your Cake and Eat It Too is recommended to most readers and highly recommended to anyone on a low-carbohydrate diet.	2005-05-03

Arf! to Zzzzzz	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Fans of "The Dog" will find this a treasure	If you are a fan of \\"The Dog\\" you will find twenty-six pictures here, one for each letter of the alphabet.  Each page contains a word for that letter of the alphabet with an appropriate \\"The Dog\\" picture.  For example, Beg shows a dog sitting up and begging and Fetch shows a dog with a stick in its mouth.  If you are a fan of \\"The Dog\\" and your child is just learning to read you will get a lot of fun together out of this book.  Be sure not to miss the picture at the very beginning before the alphabet begins, it is perhaps the best illustration of \\"puppy dog eyes\\" you'll ever see.  The Dog from Arf! Arf!

This format has both advantages and disadvantages.  The greatest advantage is that you get the entire Bible on just six CDs.  It even comes with a nice fabric CD holder to keep them from getting scratched.  The entire Bible can be placed in a common 6 CD changer and listened to at your convenience.  The down side of the MP3 format is a problem with the format itself.  If you are traveling short distances or only listening for a short while then each time you start to listen it begins at the start of that MP3 track.  As a result I found myself often having to listen to the same verses over and over because I didn't listen to it long enough to go to the next track.  The Zondervan company has done a good job of ameliorating this problem to some extent by putting each chapter on its own track, but some chapters are long and so it is still a problem at times.  With a true audio CD my player will pick up in the middle of a song or wherever I left off, not so with the MP3 format.<br /><br />The actual dramatized reading of the Bible is excellently done and I am very impressed with it.  My experience with similar products from other publishers has been that the dramatization is highly overacted and includes background music that more suited to a Cecil B. DeMille movie than an audio Bible.  Zondervan strikes a perfect balance between the dramatization and the reading such that it is a joy to listen to and effectively pulls the listener into the story.<br /><br />This is the perfect choice for those who plan to listen to it for at least half an hour or more at a time.  If you plan to listen for shorter periods of time you may be better off choosing the much larger 64 CD audio product.  The perfect combination of size and dramatization makes the NIV Audio Bible: Dramatized a highly recommended choice.	2005-05-03

Whether because they suspect infidelity, criminal activity or some other concern there are a lot of reasons why people might want to find out what others are doing on their computer.  A very important point made in the beginning of the book is the question of the ethics of spying including the effect it has on the trust of a relationship.  The authors also point out that sometimes spying is much less of an ethical consideration.  Sometimes it might be part of protecting your children from online predators or other real dangers.<br /><br />The book covers the basics of spying including creating a plan, getting the right software or hardware to implement the plan and actual implementation.  The authors do a good job of pointing out how we leave tracks behind and how to get rid of those tracks as well as how to exploit them.<br /><br />Written for the novice user it starts at the very beginning with things like how to open the command prompt and running explorer.  From there it goes on to look at more basic as well as intermediate level techniques.  The authors even include information on some rather advanced software such as ethereal (one of my personal favorites).  It does give you a solid understanding of what the different software is capable of doing but really doesn't provide a thorough treatment of any of them.  In the case of Ethereal and Snort both have complete books written about how to use them effectively so obviously part of a chapter barely scratches the surface of what can be done.<br /><br />For the most part it teaches the easier ways of finding out information without using difficult advanced tools.  It includes how to access areas where passwords, usernames, etc. are stored as well as directories and files that do not show up in explorer unless you know how to hand-enter the path to them.<br /><br />Whether you are spying on someone's web browsing, e-mail, internet chat, or instant messaging the basics are all here.  They even include information on how to remove evidence of your activities and ways to tell if you are being watched.<br /><br />These techniques are mainly for local network spying and not for use over the Internet.  Although still subject to many ethical and other considerations, for the purpose of finding out what is going on within your local network Cyber Spying is highly recommended.<br /> <br />Whether you are spying on someone's web browsing, e-mail, internet chat, or instant messaging the basics are all here.

Chapters include Installing Apache and basic configuration, building Apache the way you want it, configuring Apache the way you want it, deciding what the client needs, delivering dynamic content, hosting more than one web site, improving Apache's performance, monitoring Apache, Securing Apache, Improving Web Server Security, and Extending Apache.  It has some excellent sections on advanced configuration, handling robots, dealing with errors and handling them correctly, name-based and IP-based virtual servers, and improving the performance of your server.  The section on securing Apache covers authentication (including digest and LDAP) and using SSL (including some advanced configuration techniques).<br /><br />There are better books that deal with some of the specific areas of this text (for example, Hardening Apache is much more thorough on the subject of securing your server) but you won't find a more comprehensive text in a single volume than this one.  Pro Apache, Third Edition is highly recommended and my first choice for anyone looking for a single book to learn how to setup and configure an Apache server or serve as their primary reference.	2005-05-03

The author goes through the history of the college from its founding as the Maryland Agricultural College through the Civil War, the Great Depression, and the riots of the 1970's to today.  An intimate portrait of the college as well as a trip through the history of this part of Maryland it contains many period photographs that add to the charm of the book.  \\"The University of Maryland at College Park, a History, is highly recommended to anyone interested either in the college or the history of Maryland in general.	2005-05-03

The author examines the mental, physical, and spiritual aspects of the art to bring the reader a deeper appreciation of what it is and is not.  It even includes one of the best sections I have ever seen on what to look for in a good teacher.  With the popularity of Taiji there has been a flood of teachers, some of whom know little about the art other then one of the standard forms.<br /><br />Of course it includes the expected meditation forms and techniques that are in all Taijiquan books.  If you have ever wondered why you should practice Taiji this book contains an excellent section on the best of what Taiji has to offer the practitioner.  The book concludes with an appendix that covers the history of the popular Chen Style.  Taijiquan:  The Art of Nurturing, the Science of Power is a highly recommended book to anyone interested in Taiji.	2005-05-03

Viewing retirement not as an end of your working years but the birth of another stage of your life including new opportunities makes Looking Forward a recommended read.	2005-05-03

The first part of the book focuses on symptoms.  You look up your primary symptom, and then look to see if there are associated symptoms that match yours.  If you have a match of symptoms then you read the different possible diagnosis for those symptoms and the distinguishing features of each diagnosis.  The best way to illustrate how easy it is to use an example.  Suppose you see some blood in your urine.  You look up \\"Blood in the urine\\" and find that there are two subdivisions - with urinary difficulty or incontinence, without urinary difficulty or incontinence.  If there is no urinary difficulty or incontinence then there are five possible diagnoses provided.  Each of these five provides distinguishing features so you can easily figure out if you match one of them.<br /><br />The second part of the book details the disorders provided in the symptom diagnosis portion.  So, if you determined that you probably have an esophageal stricture you can look that disorder up and find out what it is, what causes it, prevention strategies, diagnostic techniques, how to treat it, and most importantly, when to call a doctor.  With clear writing and lavish illustrations it provides a clear understanding of the problem.  The John Hopkins Complete Home Guide to Symptoms & Remedies is a very highly recommended book to have handy in every home.	2005-05-03

Part two examines editors and publishers, what publishers look for in a book they select for publication, why some books are declined, using literary agents, establishing brand name awareness, and book promotion.  Part three examines how to build a career as an author from the initial idea to writing the book and the ins and outs of life as a bestselling author.

However, it does have a few features that make it a standout in this category.  One of the things that differentiate this book is the included software tools like Open Work Bench and version control software.  While many project management books cover just management of the project from an internal perspective, this one includes management of the external factors with the client.  For example they discuss the importance of setting up a liaison center as a primary contact point for the client and dealing with client dissatisfaction.  It is obvious that the author has had some experience with project management from gathering client expectations through delivering the final product.<br /><br />Some of the areas discussed include setting standards and guidelines, project specifications, development and testing, and requirements definition.  He details some of the things that need to be captured up front for a successful project such as system context, operating environment, end-user services, supporting services, documentation, and maintenance.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of software projects go awry for various reasons and this book details the steps to be taken to prevent those problems right from the start.  Because it takes a complete view and deals not only with the coding and the internal perspective of project management but also with client relations and setting up a framework within which to work with the client, Corporate Software Project Management is highly recommended and superior to most other project management books.	2005-04-30

While this is not as thorough as the multi-volume sets like the older Foxfire series, it is one of the most complete single-volume works available.  The text is small in order to cram all the information into this oversized almost 500 page book but it is still readable and very interesting.  The book is divided into the six major sections of animals, cooking, crafts, gardening, health and well-being, and home.  Each of these major divisions is subdivided into multiple more detailed sections.  For example, the animals section includes information on attracting desirable animals such as humming birds, building bird shelters, feeding birds while preventing squirrels from robbing the feeder, getting rid of problem animals, taking care of your pets, herbal treatments for dog problems, rabbit husbandry, horsemanship, raising chickens and ducks, beekeeping, and butchering.  Each section is similarly detailed with the gardening section being particularly large.  Country Wisdom and Know-How is an indispensable reference volume for anyone interested in country living and is highly recommended.	2005-04-30

This basic section includes booting securely, securing virtual consoles, passwords, groups, users, authentication modules, package management, hardening your kernel, and removing development tools that are not needed.<br /><br />Of course no book on hardening a system would be complete without discussing how to build an effective firewall.  The section on firewalling is excellent and strikes a solid balance between a technical presentation and a user level presentation.<br /><br />Other important areas include securing connections, secure remote administration, public-key encryption, securing files and file systems, mounting drives securely, securing removable drives, encrypting the file system, and file integrity using tripwire.<br /><br />Of course setting all of that security up helps a lot but you still need to test the system to see that it works the way you want it to.  The author examines several security testing tools to scan your system for root kits and weak passwords as well as using packet sniffers, the Snort intrusion detection system, and other tools.<br /><br />The book assumes some very basic familiarity with Linux including a file editor, the grep utility, file permissions and ownership, user administration, package management, the purpose and layout of init and init scripts, the basics of networking (TCP/IP, subnetting, etc.), and mounting and unmounting a partition.  Hardening Linux is a highly recommended book and provides a better overall view of Linux security than most similar choices.	2005-04-30

The rhyming pattern is set on the first two pages and follows that pattern throughout the rest of the book.  The illustrations are great and create a personality for each fish while at the same time staying true to their basic shape and color so that the reader can identify them.  Brightly colored, finely detailed, the illustrations themselves are exceptionally well done.  If you like fish or just want to introduce your child to the fascinating world of fish Trout, Trout, Trout is highly recommended and a lot of fun just to read and leaf through.

Smith comes forward with this account of his personal experiences as a Special Agent in Charge.  Mr. Smith takes the reader on an autobiographical tour around the world including diplomatic experiences, terrorism, and the many times the FBI ignored mounting internal evidence that could have prevented tragedies.  This is the inside story told from his point of view.  It not only exposes bungling within the FBI but also examines some of the corrupt systems in which the FBI must work.  As Special Agent in Charge of the Arkansas office he had unique insight into and a lot of problems dealing with the corrupt political system through which Bill Clinton rose to become governor and then president.

By the time he gets to the ninth hack it starts to get really interesting and by the time I ended the book I had completely changed my opinion.  The book does develop into what I would expect of a book with this title and from this publisher.

Each myth is defined and explained and then followed by an explanation of why it is inaccurate.  One of the benefits of the various books by Doug Thornburn is his discussion of ways to diagnose alcoholism much earlier than current, commonly accepted methods.  Instead of waiting until the problem of the alcoholic has created financial, legal, or medical troubles he proposes ways to diagnose the disease much earlier.  Some of these myths are concepts that continue to conceal the early stage alcoholic and so encourage their progression into latter stage diagnosable alcoholics.  Destroying these myths is part of the process of educating others so they can intervene before the person becomes the more advanced alcoholic we are all familiar with.  Alcoholism Myths and Realities is recommended for anyone interested in the subject of alcoholism.	2005-04-29

Self-scoring answer sheets complete the book and let you know approximately where you fall.

This book not only describes the basics of SUSE Linux but also includes a DVD with a complete copy of version 9.1 ready to install.  Why should you consider looking at SUSE?  If you work in the networking technical support arena then sooner or later you will have to deal with a SUSE system.  Since Novell and IBM worked together to purchase the rights to SUSE Linux you can be sure it will appear in many networking environments.<br /><br />The first part of the book provides the reader with the history of Linux, its benefits, and a description of some of the different distributions of Linux.  This is common to all introductory Linux books and can be skipped if you are already knowledgeable about Linux in general.<br /><br />The second section covers installing Linux and walks the reader through the installation process for the version on the DVD.  It is absolutely critical that this section be detailed and thorough.  The authors do an excellent job by dividing it up into four sections - pre-installation steps, installing SUSE, solving installation problems, and GUI configuration with SaX2<br /><br />Part three includes instruction on the very basics of what you need to know in order to work effectively in Linux.  The subjects in this section include booting Linux for the first time and logging in, virtual desktops, setting up e-mail and instant messaging, getting your hardware up and running, securing your system with the basic security tools and setting up the Linux firewall, using Linux replacements of Windows programs, managing your files, including accessing Windows files, floppies, CDs and DVDs, and dealing with common problems.<br /><br />If you want to have a deeper understanding of Linux (beyond the basic user level), part four introduces the Linux shell (the BASH shell in particular) and how it can be used to work with the system from the command line.  The authors also discuss the Linux virtual file system and how it works.  They conclude with a discussion of how to control processes and jobs.  This is one of the really great things about Linux - the ability to change priorities for specific jobs.<br /><br />Part five covers multimedia and working with MP3s, CDs, viewing movies, and editing images.  Of course it also covers playing and ripping MP3 Music, recording audio and burning CDs.  It includes the very basics of using GIMP, the powerful image editing software included with Linux.<br /><br />Part six covers working with Open Office.  Open Office is Linux software that does essentially the equivalent tasks as Microsoft Office (it even reads and writes Microsoft Office files).  Of, if you prefer, they also cover how to install Microsoft Office in Linux so that it works correctly.  The various chapters in this section each take on one aspect of office including using Writer, Calc, Impress (presentation software), and ReKall (database).<br /><br />Part seven is various operating system administration tasks including installing new software, managing users, optimizing the system, backing up data, scheduling, and remote access.  The authors do an excellent job in this area for a beginner book.  If you are an administrator of a SUSE system you will want a much more detailed book.<br /><br />This is a good book that is fun to work with, very well written, and covers the subjects in appropriate detail for a beginner volume.  There are better and more thorough books on some of the programs covered in this book (for example, there are complete books dedicated just to OpenOffice) but this book is not intended to be a complete reference on all the Linux programs.  Beginning SUSE Linux is a beginning book to get the reader familiar with the operating system and common programs and at this task it does an excellent job.  Beginning SUSE Linux is highly recommended and comes with a great operating system and default software.mended and comes with a great operating system and default software.	2005-04-29

For example the letter D is \\"I praise you because you Deliver\\".  It then provides and opportunity for discussion by asking the question \\"Have you ever been rescued, or needed someone's help?\\".  The page ends with Matthew 6:13 which says \\"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.\\"  This is a wonderfully done book that opens the opportunity for discussion between parent and child.  As a way to bond deeper with your child while teaching them the nature of God this is one of the best books I have seen.  A Child's ABCs of Praise is highly recommended.	2005-04-29

The author limited the analysis to churches where there was no change in leadership so the sudden growth could not be related to that change.  The analysis of the growth pattern is fairly detailed given the complexity of the situation under study.  It includes examining the situation before the sudden growth, the structure of the church leadership, doctrinal positions (conservative vs. liberal), and many other pertinent factors.  This is a well-researched book presented in a way that is easy to understand and follow.  Thom Rainer does an excellent job of wading through the various potential factors and getting down to the ones that actually affect the results.  Some of these pertinent factors were ones I expected, others were surprising and conflict with much of the current ideas of church expansion.  Breakout Churches:  Discover How to Make the Leap is recommended to all churches who want to understand the common factors of church growth and the sometimes confusing times that tend to occur just before the leap.	2005-04-29

Whether stalking, jumping, prowling, sneaking, or napping they are just all around cats.

If there are aliens on the earth then perhaps they are insects with their bizarre appearance and habits.  This is a look through a young child's eyes at how insects could be viewed as aliens.  I really like the books of this series that have complete English and Spanish texts so a child can build their vocabulary in another language easily.  Alien Invaders is a highly recommended children's book with wonderful illustrations and a real pleasure to read.	2005-03-31

This book falls under that second criteria.  The book draws the reader into the social, military, and personal life of the author during World War II.  Delta, My Beloved is a finely crafted autobiographical story that reads like a well-written fiction novel and is a recommended read.	2005-03-31

With 98 standard libraries and the ability to access Windows native APIs it is a very powerful way to write programs where you might have used CGI, XML, or SOAP before.  The book contains an excellent tutorial, a language reference, and documentation on all built-in classes, modules, and methods.<br /><br />As you would expect, the authors cover installing the software as well as practical examples to help learn the programming techniques.  With over 350 pages of documentation and references just on classes and libraries, the coverage is extensive and detailed.  This is a very practical guide on how to use Ruby effectively and efficiently.

Some like it best just because of tradition, some because of the poetic flow of so much of the text, and others for a wide variety of other reasons.  If the King James is your favorite version then this is one of the few Study Bibles available for that translation.<br /><br />I read through many of the notes on the bottom of the pages and found them to be both useful and relevant.  Although many of the notes cross-reference other verses, historical information, or similar items, some represent specific doctrinal beliefs.  Those readers with a conservative belief system will find the notes much more to their liking than those with a more liberal approach.  For example, the notes to the creation account in the beginning of Genesis support only one position - there was an original earth that was destroyed and then recreated again with the Garden of Eden.  This will cause a lot of fundamentalists great distress and even many conservatives view this as only one of the possible interpretations of the first few verses.  The reason for this is because this Study Bible presents the viewpoint of C. I. Scofield with no presentation of any alternatives.<br /><br />One of the really great features of the book is the material included in the back.  For example, instead of just a concordance it contains a real subject index, glossary, index of proper names, topical study, concordance, and an alphabetical listing of the teachings of Christ.  This makes it a great book for looking up items by subject instead of having to know specific words contained in the verse or what verses are related to the subject.  If you are a fan of Scofield (and there are many) then The King James Study Bible will be one of your favorites.  If you are not particularly a fan of Scofield you will still find it a useful resource due to the excellent study and research resources included.  The King James Study Bible is highly recommended as a solid study Bible.e is highly recommended as a solid study Bible.	2005-03-31

The book portion covers all the composers that you would expect in a work on classical music.  These include Palestrina, Bach, Handel, Hayden, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Berlioz, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Chopin, Schumann, Strauss, Liszt, Wagner, Smetana, Bruckner, Brahms, Bizet, Bruch, Musorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Grieg, Rimsky-Korsakov, Elgar, Mahler, Debussy, Strauss, Sibelius, Vaughan, Schoenberg, Ives, Ravel, Orff, Bartok, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Gershwin, Poulenc, Copland, Shostakovich, and Bernstein.<br /><br />For each composer the author gives information on their history, most important pieces, and an analysis of their work as well as several examples on the CD.  Each time they are discussing a track on the CD it is clearly identified as such in the text and the specific CD and track listed so you can easily find it and listen while reading that section.<br /><br />This is as fine of an introduction to the world as classical music as you are likely to find anywhere.

The Quick Reference Concordance does an excellent job of finding the middle ground between the small concordance typically found in the back of a Bible and an exhaustive concordance such as Strong's.  It not only lists individual words but also key phrases and where to find them.  This is a very nice and intuitive concordance that is both useful and user-friendly.<br /><br />The Bible Dictionary contains thousands of entries with both a definition of the entry and a reference to specific verses where it occurs.  Also included are several small black-and-white photographs.<br /><br />The Bible Handbook contains a short introduction to each book of the Bible, a summary of the book, and various notes in the form of sidebars.  This is a very well done small handbook.  I especially like the summary of each book of the Bible.  The author takes a section of the book that is related to a particular theme or event, lists the particular verses, and then provides the summary of that theme or event.  This way you know not only what is happening but also the specific verses if you want to go back to the Bible and read the whole text.<br /><br />Although the books are small they are packed with accurate, useful information.  This desk reference set makes an excellent gift for your favorite pastor, Bible teacher, or Bible student.

The ten comments about each chapter are (1) Before and After, (2) Analysis of the Chapter, (3) Key Verse, (4) Key Word or Phrase, (5) Key Event, Person or Theme, (6) Key Thought, (7) Key Thing to Look For, (8) Key Bible Cross-reference, (9) Key explanation, and (10) Key Quote.  Most people think of a commentary work examining and explaining verses, particular word use, customs of the time, or similar.  This book contains no commentary of that nature.  Instead it is a chapter level examination of the bible.  If you are interested in a key thought summary of each chapter of the Bible this is just what you are looking for.  If you are looking for a word and verse level commentary you will be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a high-level summary and outline of the Bible the Key Word Commentary is recommended.	2005-03-31

The book includes best practices, tools, and principles on how best to write, document and implement a project.<br /><br />The three primary divisions of the book follow along with the title and are sequenced as Objects, Patterns, and Practice.  The Objects section covers the history of PHP and how it evolved to include a focus on object-oriented programming.  This section contains some of the more basic information in the book including the principles behind objects, classes and inheritance.  The section on Patterns examines problems of software design and ways to approach and resolve these problems.  In this section the reader learns basic design principles that should be implemented on all projects to make them easier to troubleshoot or expand on later.  The last section covers the practices and tools that can be used to correctly manage a project.  The focus is on managing your code, managing your project, tracking bugs, collaboration between programmers, and making the project easy to install.  It includes a section on Concurrent Versions System (CVS) which allows multiple programmers to work on the same code without overwriting each other's work.<br /><br />Although it assumes some knowledge of PHP programming it does not assume any knowledge of object-oriented programming and that appears to be one of the primary purposes of the book - to take PHP4 programmers and teach them to take advantage of the abilities of PHP5.  This is not to say that you can't get a lot of value from the book without prior knowledge of PHP.  If you have programmed before and have a basic PHP syntax reference guide available then this book will still be a valuable read.  PHP 5 Objects, Patterns, and Practice is highly recommended for PHP programmers making the move to PHP5 and PHP5 programmers that need a handle on best practices.	2005-02-09

The authors even go so far as to include competing theories about treatment, origins of the disease, etc.  Even-handed and complete the Encyclopedia of Sexually Transmitted Disease is a solid survey of the current understanding of sexually transmitted diseases.	2005-02-06

Newly updated for 2004 returns, the Zondervan 2005 Minister's Tax and Financial Guide should be read and understood by all ministers and church financial committees.	2005-02-06

If you want to know how to find the files you want and download them safely then you will be interested in this book.<br /><br />The author covers a wide array of places to find files including newsgroups, websites, Instant Messenger, Internet Relay Chat, FTP, and networks that are designed specifically for file sharing such as Gnutella, FastTrack, and eDonkey.  One of the most interesting parts for the average computer user is the one with information on how to remain anonymous when sharing files.  Of course, this section also includes information on the problems of file sharing - viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, adware, and even warez.<br /><br />I've traded files and worked on the Internet for years and I still learned a few tips in this book.  The author includes lots of illustrations and specific web sites where you can download the programs he mentions as well as several alternative ones.  Mr. Wang even provides a complete analysis of each program's advantages and disadvantages.  One of the things I really like is the fact that he includes information on programs you should be careful downloading and using including Fast Track clients that come loaded with spyware like Kazaa and iMesh.<br /><br />If you don't like AIM he even covers Private Internet Messenger products like Meet Gate, P2P Instant Messenger, and Pal Talk.  The breadth of coverage is impressive, the writing and organization excellent.  Steal This File-Sharing Book is highly recommended to anyone who shares files over the Internet.	2005-02-06

How do we find that one person God has destined for us?  How do we know that a decision is the right one?  Traditional Christian thought has taught that God has a specific plan for each of us and it is our job to find out what that is and pursue it.  Jerry Sittser takes a different point of view by first making the case that the will of God may not be some specific future plan with all the details already worked out but may in fact be much simpler.  What about the problem of pain and suffering?  Do those indicate that we are out of the will of God?  Jerry Sittser examines these and other questions as he teaches how the will of God may be a lot more liberating than what we have traditionally been taught.  Offering a pathway to personal peace through understanding the will of God in a less traditional way, The Will of God as a Way of Life is a highly recommended read.	2005-02-06

S. Lewis meant them to be read instead of the order in which they were published.  For example The Magician's Nephew was written several years after The Chronicles of Narnia was started but was meant to be read first.  In this collection it is placed first as Mr. Lewis meant it to be read.  In addition it includes a short essay from C. S. Lewis on the subject of Writing for Children.  This is a massive work of almost 800 pages.<br /><br />Most readers will be at least somewhat familiar with The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as it has been in several smaller children's books and even some television specials, but it is only the beginning of the Chronicles of Narnia.  The complete chronicles include The Magician's Nephew, The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, and The Last Battle.<br /><br />This is a high quality hardbound book that will survive the typical abuse of children when reading it.  If you liked The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe you will love the complete collection.  The Chronicles of Narnia, one of the all-time classics of children literature, is a highly recommended read and this publication of it should be considered for all public libraries and private collections.	2005-02-06

Primarily it is the implementation of role-based access control, sandboxing, and an audit facility that allows the system to log any attempts to exceed specified permissions.  It does all this without conflicting with the normal permissions of Linux.  If you are able to access a file through normal discretionary access control then the role-based mandatory access control provides additional security to determine if you can run the file or not.  The only way to open a file is if both systems agree that you should be able to open it.<br /><br />The author covers installation, configuration, administering, and setting up a security policy.  The presentation of SeLinux is straightforward and the security model is presented in a writing style that makes it clear and understandable to the reader.<br /><br />SeLinux: NSA's Open Source Security Enhanced Linux is highly recommended as both a Linux security solution and an excellent book on how to utilize all the resources of SeLinux.	2005-02-06

It is a much better match for someone with some knowledge of Active Directory who wants to take their knowledge to the next level and become a true Active Directory wizard.  For those with some knowledge who wants to really get down to the inner workings of Active Directory in a depth of detail and breadth of coverage unmatched by any other book this is the place to turn.<br /><br />Kouti and Seitsonen provide excellent coverage of topics a lot of people have difficulty understanding and setting up properly.  This book supplies you with sound background theory so you can understand these concepts and at the same time gives just the right amount of detail to actually accomplish what you are trying to do.<br /><br />Inside Active Directory, Second Edition is highly recommended to everyone already possessing a basic understanding of Active Directory and who wants to have the best single reference available at hand.	2005-02-06

The author covers issues of accountability, tax exemption, employee compensation, benefits, reporting, financial records, charitable gifting, risk management, and many other common problem areas.  Of particular value is the special index that points the reader to the specific issues and problems of churches.  In addition there are multiple checklists, charts, procedures, and even sample board resolutions.<br /><br />Written in plain English so anyone can understand and yet comprehensive enough to keep your nonprofit or church well-organized and out of trouble, the Zondervan 2005 Church and Nonprofit Tax and Financial Guide is highly recommended to everyone involved with the financial aspects of any nonprofit or church.	2005-02-06

This is one of those books.  Throughout the Old Testament God is referred to by various names.  Each one represents a specific attribute of God that is particularly relevant to those circumstances.  Taken together these names reveal the nature of God and point to ways to see and seek Him as well as understand our relationship with Him.  This book is insightful, encouraging, and inspirational while at the same time moving your prayer life up to another level.<br /><br />Full of Bible references, Praying the Names of God is highly recommended and sure to bring a deeper understanding of God to the reader.  The only thing about the book that some may find troublesome is the lack of capitalization on all personal pronouns related to God.  While God, Lord, and other references are capitalized, Him, His, and He are not.  Some more conservative readers may have a problem with this.  My advice to them is to not let something like this cause them to miss a very good book.	2005-02-06

If you know the basics of Perl and have programmed much with it then you know the frustration of knowing what you want it to do but needing to resolve one minor issue to get it to work.  This book contains a lot of the most common problems and solutions.  It is not meant to teach you Perl, but to resolve those sticky problems that stop your progress until you figure them out.  After starting with some best practices advice it moves into scalar variables and lists, arrays and hashes, operators and precedence, conditionals and loops, regular expressions, subroutines, references, built-in variables, built-in functions, file handling, built-in modules, data structures, creating packages and modules, creating classes and objects, debugging and style guide, CGI programming, Perl and XML, and secure scripts.<br /><br />Each solution states the function to be used, how it operates, an example of its use, an explanation of what occurs in the example, and a list of related solutions with the page number.

One of the unique features is a lot of bright pictures that appear to be drawn by children.  With a very brief introduction before each book, questions scattered throughout to encourage children to think about the lessons behind the stories, and lots of other features it is an excellent choice for children.  The Bible ends with a section on life in the New Testament times and a small dictionary.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is the placement of the various pictures.  For example the pictures of Jesus walking on the water and Peter's vision are both in the pages of the book of Jeremiah.  Likewise Zacchaeus Climbing the tree is in the pages of Ezekiel.  This can be confusing to a child when the pictures are in the wrong books.  Even with this caveat it is more than just a readable children's Bible, it teaches children how to study, think about what they have read, and find additional information using the dictionary.  The Kids Study Bible: New International Readers Version is highly recommended as a first Study Bible for young children.	2005-02-06

The author becomes your own personal guide as he takes you on a virtual tour of some of the most breathtaking scenes of the area.

There isn't much in terms of explanation but it is still a great resource with some surprises.  Some of the charts include a Contrast Between the Abrahamic and Mosaic Covenant, Stages of the Kingdom of God, Biblical Types, Basic Approaches to Eschatology, Harmony of Daniel, Views on the Relationship of Joel, Alternate Determinations of the Seventy Weeks of Daniel, Comparison of Covenant Theology and Dispensationalism, Contrasts between the Rapture Views, Prophetic Significance of Old Testament Offerings, Views on the Millennium, Evaluating Views on Daniel, and even a few charts on the similarities and differences between Muslim, Jewish, and Christian eschatology.

In addition to the dog biscuit recipes the book includes five cookie cutters to cut your treats into the shape of a dog bone, heart, cat, fire hydrant, or doghouse.  The obvious question to many readers is why bother to make your own dog biscuits when you can buy them so readily at the store?  If you have to ask then you really don't understand the bond between many dog owners and their dog.  For me it is because I can control the ingredients and I can create the \\"perfect\\" training snack.  My dog is quite finicky about dog treats and doesn't like most of the store brands, so using them as a reward just doesn't work.  On the other hand the recipe for Cheddar Liver in this book makes a perfect training reward that she will do almost anything to get.  The book itself contains 24 different recipes for everything from basic cheese biscuits to liver and oat, liver leather, multigrain herb, grain-free and even carob biscuits.  All are easy to make, although several do require a food processor to puree the ingredients.  The attached box with the cutters in it is pretty flimsy and soon falls apart.  However, the pages of the book are connected to the box via three metal split rings so the box can be removed, the cutters placed in a kitchen drawer or other appropriate place and the book placed on the bookshelf.  This took a lot of thought to put the book together in this fashion so it can be easily converted to a standard book and was greatly appreciated on my part.  You Bake `Em Dog Biscuits is highly recommended to dog lovers everywhere and a perfect gift for that friend who treats their dog as a part of the family.	2005-02-06

Some of the writing comes directly from the Psalms (i.e. Make my heart your own) and can be a good way to introduce children to the Bible by locating the same passage.<br /><br />The authors emphasizes continuously throughout the book that God cares about all the details of our life including the most minor things you do and say each day. Written predominantly as a prayer it helps teach children the importance of prayer and how to pray.  Dear God, It's Me is a recommended children's book.	2005-02-06

This book is primarily intended for the reader who already has some PHP knowledge and needs to understand how to build an e-commerce site.  It does not focus on teaching either PHP 5 or MySQL but instead focuses on how to use the combination to produce an exceptional e-commerce solution.<br /><br />The authors use the example of a Tshirt shop and walk the reader through every step of completely constructing a viable e-commerce site.  The book covers everything from designing your site, to creating a product catalog, searching the catalog, receiving payments, catalog administration, creating a shopping basket, working with customer orders, product recommendations, storing customer information, secure connections, implementing the order pipeline, working with credit cards, and setting up product reviews.<br /><br />The appendixes include detailed information on installing Apache, PHP, MySQL, and phpAdmin (for both Windows and Unix-like systems), hosting your web site, and project management.<br /><br />While this is not a book about learning the PHP scripting language it does contain enough detailed code to create a functioning e-commerce site even if you don't understand how the code works.  For example, on page 192 it says to \\"Create a new template file named admin_login.tpl in the templates folder and add the following code to it:...\\"  This is followed by a long code listing that produces the desired results.  There is a short explanation of the function of various sections of the code but nothing that details the purpose of each command, variable, etc.  This is really not a problem since they state up front that the target audience is a PHP programmer who needs to learn how to build an e-commerce site, but it does deserve mention for those who have no knowledge of PHP and are considering the book.<br /><br />The first thing a person might notice when thinking about purchasing this book is that there is no CD in the back containing all the many examples of source code.  This could be very discouraging as the examples are extensive and rewriting them by hand without error can be a daunting task.  However, Apress does make all of the examples available for download at their web site.<br /><br />Beginning PHP 5 and MySQL E-Commerce is highly recommended for anyone who has some basic knowledge of PHP and MySQL and wants to capitalize on this to build a powerful e-commerce site.this book is that there is no CD in the back containing all the many examples of source code.

This book not only details using Nessus but also comes with a CD containing the program, as well as Ethereal, Snort, and Newt (a port of the program to the Windows environment).<br /><br />What is a network assessment?  At its basic level it is an attempt to detect a live system and then identify the computing environment, services, applications, and vulnerabilities on that system.  Basically there are two types of assessment - internal and external.  An internal assessment is done over the local network and external is done from outside the LAN.  Nessus will do both types and the book details how to do either, or both of them.<br /><br />The authors do an excellent job of detailing installation, setup, and how to interpret the results of a scan as well as various factors that can affect the report.  One of the parts not to be missed is the discussion of not only the benefits but also the potential problems of scanning your system.  Some of the vulnerability types scanned for include buffer overflows, default passwords, backdoors, information leaks, and denial of service.<br /><br />The Nessus scripting language is covered in detail in Appendix A instead of the main portion of the book; a choice I appreciated very much as it allowed the flow of the book to not be interrupted by such a highly technical section.  With Open Source products there generally is no organized technical support phone number you can call of help.  So, the authors include information on how to get help via the Nessus User Community, mailing lists, and archives.<br /><br />Nessus Network Auditing is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in auditing their network to find potential problems before they become reality.	2005-02-04

That is somewhat the premise of this book.  Author James Green interviewed people and asked them to share some of their most significant insights that they have learned when asked what they would do differently in life if they could do it over.  The answers are arranged into the categories of life experience, the one who got away, marriage, careers, high school, college, money, grudges, parents, children, siblings, grandparents, friends, kindness, and retirement.  After sorting through hundreds of responses Mr. Green has put the 87 most insightful and inspirational answers into this book.  Each of the responses is well written and contains at least one major truth about life.  Interesting and insightful for people of all ages, If There's One Thing I've Learned is highly recommended and should be considered by all parents as an excellent choice for a graduation present.

The chapter on finding the bottlenecks is one of the best sections in the book and details some of the finer points to be considered when creating your database.  On the other hand, the part on optimizing queries is excellent for the beginning MySQL student (which is the target audience for this book) but not as good as it could be for the more experienced MySQL user.  Perhaps I am just more sensitive to this area because of all the badly done queries I have had to deal with before.  A good understanding of just this part can make a tremendous difference in optimization.  If you are new to SQL queries the authors have done a great job of explaining why this is important and how to understand it when a query takes under a minute to run and then after a small change takes twenty.  The last section covers accessing the MySQL database via other programming languages such as PHP.  Beginning MySQL Database Design and Optimization is a recommended read for its target audience - the beginning MySQL programmer.	2005-02-04

The problem is that a graphical interface that is similar enough to the Windows or MacIntosh systems that there would be minimal training and yet is easy to install without problems has been long in coming.  While there are several contenders today, the Java Desktop System (JDS) Linux Desktop is one of the fastest, and easiest to install.<br /><br />In Exploring the JDS Linux Desktop the authors take the reader through the installation process and all the basic information for using the JDS Linux Desktop.  Not only do they go over the infrastructure items like networking and printing but also the most common applications that come with JDS Linux Desktop.  These applications include email, calendaring, instant messenger, the web browser, StarWriter (word processing), and StarCalc (spreadsheet).  They even go over various options for running Windows programs in JDS Linux including some options that often run Windows programs faster than Windows!<br /><br />The book comes with a Live CD, which is a version of JDS Linux Desktop that runs from the CD.  Simply put it into your CD-Rom drive and boot your computer and you are running Linux with a graphical interface.  I tried it on a couple of computers on which I had trouble getting a much more popular version of Linux to recognize the on-board video interface but JDS Linux Desktop got it right the first time and worked as expected without any special manual configuration.  While many of the items covered in the book are not on the CD, enough of them are there to give the user a good feel for how the operating system works.  The book warns that the Live CD allows you to create documents but you cannot save them.  However, that is not entirely true.  If you are knowledgeable in Linux it is simple enough to open a terminal and mount the hard drive - including a Windows formatted drive and save any files there.<br /><br />Although I have done a lot with the Linux operating system this is the first time I have used the Sun Java Desktop System (JDS).  The interface is very professional and definitely on par with Windows.  Exploring the JDS Linux Desktop is a highly recommended read for anyone who wants to learn the basics of navigating and using this system.the hard drive - including a Windows formatted drive and save any files there. <br /> <br />Although I have done a lot with the Linux operating system this is the first time I have used the Sun Java Desktop System (JDS).

The very first chapter set this book apart from most others by the excellent writing style and clear explanations.  This first section covers the basics from how to approach the problem to the steps to take to isolate it and the methodology for approaching a workable solution.  These are the specific methods and techniques that so many computer consulting companies use and wish they could find employees who know how to follow it.  Although it is a Windows centric book this part on troubleshooting methodology applies to all operating systems and software.<br /><br />After the overview of how to troubleshoot a problem, the book goes into specific scenarios with both examples and cookbooks on how to resolve the problem.  Areas that get their own chapter include network printing, workstation troubleshooting, server troubleshooting, SQL Server troubleshooting, Exchange Server troubleshooting, wide area networks and IP Routing, wireless networking, firewall troubleshooting, and virtual private networking troubleshooting.<br /><br />This book provides specific tools, specific techniques, and details on how to interpret the results.  When a printer prints garbage, when servers disappear from the network neighborhood, when shared network resources suddenly disappear, you will want to pick this book up first.  The Real-World Network Troubleshooting Manual is very highly recommended.	2004-12-27

The unique thing about the book is the gradual mixing of Latin American Spanish words into the story.  Through a simple reading of the story a child can learn a handful of Spanish words by their context within the story.  Once a Spanish word is introduced it is continued throughout the remainder of the book.  \\"Isabel and the Hungry Coyote\\" is a wonderful read and a recommended book for introducing children to the Latin American Spanish language.	2004-12-27

This one takes a totally different approach for teaching the basics of stock investing and how the market moves by following the characters in a fictional novel.  By reading the various actions they take, the reasoning behind those actions, and the how they adapt to changes the reader comes to understand the basics of the stock market.  If you are not a technically inclined person and don't want to get bogged down in trend analysis, price/earnings ratios, or other more complex methods of explaining the market then this book is a great way to get a handle on what goes on.  If you want insight into how Wall Street works for both the insiders who understand it and the outsiders who don't then The Perfect Stock is an easy and illuminating read.	2004-12-27

Instead it tells a story simply by following the illustrations.  What story does it tell?  That is where it gets interesting.  I had several people look at it and tell me what they thought was happening and all, young and old alike, had some very different and insightful differences.  This is a book for stretching the imagination of children and adults and was a lot of fun.

Besides these common problems he also discusses other ways that people can place their self in danger or be taken advantage of on the Internet.  For example, he examines the problems of chat rooms and some of the various scams currently on the Internet.<br /><br />While this is a good book for those with no understanding of these problems it falls short of being a complete guide simply because it ignores so many areas where the truly dangerous predators lurk.  For example, it should at least mention the problems associated with forwarding mail from a friend to your friend list.  If done incorrectly it provides people with a complete list of your friends and their e-mail addresses.  Starting with this information you can start building a profile of an individual including their friends, area where they live, go to school, etc.  Areas like this are completely missing from the book but are some of the most commonly used practices of the truly nefarious predators on the net.  Viruses only destroy your computer; these predators can get into your life.  As a result \\"Always Use Protection\\" warrants a rating as \\"recommended\\" but could be much better.	2004-12-27

Most people assume that there are few if any issues with Open Source and Free Software Licensing but that often is not the case.  While it may be free to install you wade into murky waters when you change the code, make a new program that uses some of the coding of the open source program, make a derivative program, or a host of other situations.  Part of the confusion is that all Open Source or Free Software licensing is not the same.  For example there are the MIT, BSD, Apache, and Academic Free Licenses.  Or what about the GNU license?  Most people don't realize that there are two different versions of GNU licenses, the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)?  Then there is the Mozilla Public License, Q Public License, Artistic License, and Creative Commons License.<br /><br />Author Andrew M. St. Laurent does an excellent job explaining all these various licenses, what you can do and can't do, the various benefits and shortcomings of the licenses and pitfalls to watch for.  If you are doing development in this arena, have made an improvement to one of the programs, or have written a program for internal use that might have resell value you can't afford to not understand the nuances of the various licensing agreements.  Understanding Open Source & Free Software Licensing is highly recommended and required reading for anyone in this situation.	2004-12-27

Sometimes they will be the right choice and sometimes they will not.  When you make a bad choice, or wrong turn, you cause the relationship to experience tension, frustration, and disappointment that you should not have to endure.  Making the right turn allows you to avoid these problems and experience more satisfaction in the relationship.  While nobody is perfect and so there will always be times when we make a wrong turn, it is possible to learn to identify them early and make the right choices more and more often.  This is the goal of this book, to teach the reader how to identify and make those right turns.<br /><br />The author starts by examining the characteristics of both a healthy and unhealthy relationship.  From there he moves to understanding and respecting your relationship, creating a vision for where you want your relationship to be, and making it a priority in your life to move in that direction.  By the time he gets the reader to this point the author starts asking the reader to consider their answers to various questions to help gain direction for their relationship.  For example he asks, \\"What behaviors do you want to stop doing on a daily basis?\\", \\"What behaviors would you like to start implementing daily?\\", \\"Identify several positive characteristics or behaviors of your partner.\\"<br /><br />Other areas the author looks at include the rules and boundaries we live by, how to communicate better, better problem solving skills, creating change, and creating an action plan.  If you want to take an active role in improving your relationship this book will help you understand how.  There are other books on rescuing or improving a relationship but very few of them go as far as Myron Lewis has done in preparing insightful questions to help the reader decide what is important, what needs to change, and how to achieve that change.  Making Right Turns in Your Relationship is highly recommended for anyone who truly wants to work through a plan with their partner to actively create change in their relationship and manage that change to create the best possible relationship.Your Relationship is highly recommended for anyone who truly wants to work through a plan with their partner to actively create change in their relationship and manage that change to create the best possible relationship.	2004-12-27

A person who seemed to embrace the Christian religion he was nevertheless a person who never joined a church.  Although some sources state that he never attended church the records of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington show that he attended there regularly during his presidential years.  For many the ultimate determination of his religious leanings are based on his actions, his words, and the writings of his close friend Charles Carleton Coffin who states that a spiritual crisis in 1841 was the turning point in Lincoln's life and resulted in his embracing Christianity.<br /><br />In The Spiritual Abraham Lincoln author V. Neil Wyrick examines this spiritual side of one of our favorite presidents.  Lincoln's strong reliance on God's guidance and the Bible shows throughout the book as you read an account of his life that focuses not on politics, but on belief.  While some may argue that President Lincoln was not a Christian, very few would argue that he had a deep abiding sense of belief in God that kept him going even in the worst of times.  The Spiritual Abraham Lincoln is a recommended read.	2004-12-27

While this book does cover most of the command line information you need to use a Linux system, its best feature is the extensive coverage of shell scripting and other subjects that generally receive minimal treatment in most Linux books.  The authors list internal shell commands and how they are used as well as working with the shell history file.  It ends with a section on extending the functionality of the shell based on the items learned in the first two sections.  Shell coverage is excellent for the bash and the z-shell and pretty much non-existent for others like the c-shell, t-shell and Korn shell.  From Bash to Z-Shell: Conquering the Command Line is one of the best books I've read on the bash and z-shell and is highly recommended to anyone learning to work with either of these two of the most popular of all Linux shells.	2004-12-27

Bart D. Ehrman comes forward to fill this role.  Professor Ehrman is chairman of the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and has made several appearances on the History Channel, CNN, A&E, and other programs as a widely recognized expert on the early Church.  While he recognizes that The Da Vinci Code is a well written book and \\"a real page turner\\" he also takes exception with author Dan Brown's claim that it is based on historical fact.  Since this is an area of particular expertise for Mr. Ehrman he took a particular interest in the book and its claims.  For example, at several points in The Da Vinci Code the author has the characters refer to the writings of the early Christian church that were not put into the canon and what they contained.  Fortunately, this is an area in which Mr. Ehrman has written two books and produced a lecture series on those \\"lost\\" scriptures and their contents.  So he speaks with authority about what was in those manuscripts as well as what was not.  While Mr. Ehrman does not step outside the areas of his expertise and comment on the information about Da Vinci and other art works mentioned in the book, he does provide a lucent and thoroughly well researched commentary on the historical aspects of the book as related to the early Church.  Needless to say, the multiple errors and outright fantasies in this area leads the reader to question the credibility of the rest of The Da Vinci Code.  Truth and Fiction in The Da Vinci Code is a highly recommended book and should be read by anyone who has read or intends to read The Da Vinci Code.	2004-12-27

After several hours I finally got it into a text file thanks to a web site that did the conversion.  But even then I lost the tables, illustrations, etc.  How to do that is one of the hacks included in this book.  I wish it were printed a few years ago because it would have made my life easier.<br /><br />After testing that hack I browsed through the book and kept finding myself asking \\"You can do that with a PDF file?\\"  There are a lot of good tips in this book from making Acrobat startup faster, to converting PDF files, to automatic timed scrolling for easy reading, to creating a PDF using Word, WordPerfect, OpenOffice, Perl, HTML, PHP, and Java.  With page after page of coding, this is a tremendously useful book for anyone who wants to create or edit PDF files or change the way Acrobat works with files.

Recipes include Apple Cider, Apple Punch, Old Fashioned Apple Butter, Applesauce, Apple Pie Filling, Apple Carrot Salad, Waldorf Salad (a particularly good recipe for this classic), Apple Wild Rice Pilaf, Apple Stuffed Game Hens (another really good recipe), Apple Black Walnut Pie, Apple Pie, Apple Crisp, Apple Cake, and Carmel Apples among many, many others.  The only apple recipe that I was surprised not to find was one for Apple Streudel, one of my personal favorites.  Still, if you like apples you are sure to find several recipes that will delight you.  For apple lovers it is a must read book.	2004-12-27

It starts with an introductory chapter that explains the problem of defining an intrusion and why it is becoming more and more of a problem.  It follows up with a chapter on network traffic analysis including packet sniffing and using tcpdump and ethereal.  Then comes the meat of the text - installing Snort.  Of course to really understand how to use Snort you have to understand how attacks occur and the common methods used.  The authors provide a really nice chapter on this subject.  After that come five chapters on configuring, deploying, and managing Snort rules, intrusion prevention strategies, and tuning.  Once Snort is up and running the authors examine the use of ACID and SnortCenter as Snort IDS management consoles.  Either of these products drastically decreases the burden of analyzing what has happened and is happening on the intrusion detection forefront.  The book ends with additional tools for Snort IDS management and implementation strategies for high-bandwidth situations.<br /><br />There are other very good books on Snort but one of the things that makes this one particularly valuable is that it also looks at other open source tools and provides a good basic background on intrusion detection theory.  Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools is highly recommended for those in charge of intrusion detection and prevention in a network environment and planning to implement a system their self.	2004-12-27

From the beginnings of their career when they first took an interest in acting to moving and settling in to a new home, survival jobs, live theater, Broadway life, the changing scene of Broadway, the personal life of an actor and problems that acting creates, romance, road trips, and finally when dreams come true, the whole life cycle of an actor is uncovered in detail.  This is a very good book that shows the difference between the glamorized version of being a Broadway actor and what it really takes in terms of commitment, experiences, and the toll on your personal life.  But it does not concentrate entirely on the difficulties of becoming an actor; the authors also discuss the thrill when you actually make it.  When so many people have false ideas of what it would be like, and colleges and training facilities have a financial interest in encouraging students to remain it is a breath of fresh air to hear the viewpoint of all of these actors who have actually made it.  Just like any other occupation, acting has its good and bad points and this book points them out from the perspective of people who did make it.  Making It On Broadway is a recommended read for anyone who wants to pursue acting as a career.	2004-12-27

As one of the We Both Read series the left pages contain more difficult words and background information while the right pages have both smaller and fewer words.  This design is so reading can be a family experience with the parent reading the left pages and the child the right pages.  The final two pages of the book include a dictionary and a section on word roots.  About Dinosaurs is educational while still being fun and a recommended children's book.	2004-12-27

The certification consists of one exam on Operating Systems and one on Applications.  The purpose of this book is to prepare the test taker to pass the exams.  As such, the book covers the exam objectives, installation, configuration, troubleshooting operating systems and applications, hardware devices and drivers, user environments, customization, and application security.  It even comes with a CD-ROM with practice tests.<br /><br />The book does a good job of covering the various ways to install a Windows operating system as well as how to update a Windows system.  Throughout the book are questions and answers to help the reader test their knowledge of the subject.  Unfortunately, while it does provide the answers it does not provide an explanation of why it is the correct one.  Presumably you would have to look it up in the text to understand why it is the correct one and the other answers incorrect.<br /><br />While the subject can be very technical it is written in an easy to follow narrative style.  One of the problems of most certification exams is that real life often varies considerably from a pristine laboratory environment assumed in most exam situations.  This may be an excellent book to prepare for the exam if that is your goal but it may not the best to learn actual installation and troubleshooting.  For example, the problems that arise when upgrading an operating system can be quite difficult to troubleshoot and the book does not deal with this real life situation to any significant extent.  For the purpose of passing the certification exam MCDST Exams is a recommended purchase and since acquiring the certification is the purpose of the book, it scores a direct hit.	2004-12-27

This compilation book keeps each of the three included books separated by a tab so it ends up being organized by Inexpensive Recipes, Soups and Stews, and Entertaining Recipes by default.<br /><br />While there are no photos of any of the end products, the instructions are clear and easy to follow so you really can't make a mistake.  I like the wide variety of recipes in each section.  These include ones you would expect, like various casseroles, and recipes you would not expect to cook with a crock-pot like Cornish Game Hens and Brazilian Coffee.  The estimated time to prepare and the number of servings is listed at the top of the recipe right under the name so you don't have to scan through the recipe each time you are looking for something that can be prepared in fifteen minutes.  Unfortunately it does not have the cooking time listed there also, so while it might take fifteen minutes to prepare it may take three hours to cook.  If you are looking for a meal that can be prepared in fifteen minutes and cook for two hours while you attend your child's school recital you have to search through the recipes.<br /><br />Very well organized with a tremendous variety of recipes for all occasions, Crazy About Crockery is a recommended cookbook.	2004-12-27

The book covers everything from the mundane privacy problems people don't think about to high level privacy issues.  For example, he discusses the privacy problems of sending a \\"private\\" email to someone else when it is subject to examination at your ISP level, may be on their backup tapes, may be on the log files of several computers between your ISP and the ending ISP, may be subject to examination by anyone of them, etc.  He also discusses the privacy considerations of such items as medical patient records accessed over the Internet, encryption issues, and authorization issues.<br /><br />With all this background information in mind he then discusses how to integrate consideration of these privacy issues into your program and way of thinking in general.  This is not an expose of particular privacy problems but a theoretical framework for privacy that uses real-world examples to illustrate the issues.  One of the really good points the author makes is that there is a difference between privacy and security.  There are a lot of good books on security available today but privacy is rarely discussed.  The author provides a thoroughly convincing argument as to why security is not enough and privacy issues must be considered at all times and in all environments.<br /><br />Privacy:  What Developers and IT Professionals Should Know is highly recommended for everyone even remotely connected to the computer technology environment, no exceptions.	2004-12-27

In particular, what is the appropriate form of church government?  In Who Runs the Church?: 4 Views on Church Government the editors compile the views of representatives of the four predominant types of church government.  Just about every form of church government is some variation of one of these four.  The four views discussed are Episcopalianism, Presbyterianism, Single-Elder Congregationalism, and Plural-Elder Congregationalism.<br /><br />Arguing for Episcopalianism is Dr. Peter Toon, rector of Christ Church, Biddulph Moor, Diocese of Lichfield, in the Church of England.  Arguing the position of Presbyterianism is Dr. L. Roy Taylor the clerk/coordinator of administration of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in America.  Presenting the position of Single-Elder Congregationalism is Dr. Paige Patterson, president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas.  And presenting the case for Plural-Elder Congregationalism is Samuel E. Waldron, Ph.D. candidate in systematic theology at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.<br /><br />A typical chapter starts with one of them presenting their position on their chosen form of church government and why it is the most appropriate one.  This presentation is then followed by commentary by each of the people with differing views.<br /><br />Each presents their case with passion and argues it well.  If you want to understand why some churches choose one form of government or why others feel that position is wrong you will find excellent explanations in this book.  Who Runs the Church? 4 Views on Church Government is highly recommended to anyone interested in this area.	2004-12-27

That is usually the biggest problem with origami books, how do you describe and illustrate an unusual fold?  This is a three-dimensional activity illustrated in a two-dimensional medium and is difficult to describe well.  Author Nick Robinson does a great job and all the folds on the projects I did were easy to figure out.<br /><br />The book is divided into five sections that work from basic techniques to beginner projects to intermediate projects to challenging projects and ends with a photographic piece on origami from around the world.  This last section showcases masterful pieces of origami work and while it does not include instructions for these pieces it does provide a glimpse of what can be done by a professional.<br /><br />Some of the included subjects include geometric shapes, animals, and flowers.  With projects for all ages, The Encyclopedia of Origami is a wonderfully fun book anyone can use to successfully fold origami pieces and a highly recommended book.	2004-12-27

Two psychologists, Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend examine the personal growth process and point out how that process is found within the pages of the Bible.  With that personal growth process as the starting point they then show how personal growth is in fact spiritual growth.  This is one of the best books on personal growth that I have read.  How People Grow is highly recommended to anyone seeking to change their life, get out of the rut of stagnation, or move to a happier place in their life.  It is also recommended to Christian counselors, Pastoral counselors, and others involved with helping people.	2004-12-27

They even cover the subject of sprites and jets above the clouds, an area only recently being seriously investigated after years of reports but only recent proof of its existence.<br /><br />The author explains everything in easy to understand terms while still being through enough to provide a complete education in basic weather.  Of particular value are the numerous pictures of actual weather events so you can see what different cloud types look like or the effects of hail, or even see a cold front slipping under a warm layer of air.  Skywatch West is a fascinating book for anyone interested in understanding the weather and very highly recommended.	2004-12-01

It focuses on the problem of boundaries for Christians in particular.  For example, if Christians are supposed to be loving and helpful to their neighbors then at what point are you supposed to say \\"No\\" to something they want or need?  Dr. Cloud and Dr. Townsend help lead the reader through the process of setting up appropriate personal boundaries that define who you are and how you will interact with others.<br /><br />The authors are right on target with their ten laws of boundaries and eight myths about boundaries.  If you can follow these laws and dispel these myths you will go a long way toward reclaiming your life and finding happiness.  The section on boundaries and your family is also excellent and shows the authors' depth of understanding about family dynamics.  Other specific areas discussed include boundaries and your friends, boundaries and your spouse, boundaries and your children, boundaries and your work, boundaries and your self, and even boundaries and God.<br /><br />This is an excellent book and is highly recommended to help everyone set appropriate boundaries in their life.  While it was published in 1992, Boundaries is still often recommended by Christian and Pastoral counselors and timeless in its application to the human condition.	2004-12-01

Animals have a biological clock that tells them when to mate, when to migrate, when to return, and many other patterns of their life.  While we have forced ourselves into the pattern of time regulated by the rotation of the earth and revolutions around the sun, many other animals regulate their patterns by lunar or other patterns.  With lots of examples of differing biological time patterns the author leads the reader on a fascinating journey into this field of knowledge.  He even gives examples of aboriginal tribes that regulate their concept of time and seasons based on things like when certain species of fish return to the islands or a tribe of Indians who associated the return of salmon to the rivers with the appearance of a particular moth.  Fascinating reading and a view into how we are all interconnected as the biorhythms of one species associate it with another.  Biological Time is a recommended read for anyone interested in biological rhythms.	2004-12-01

The book literally follows the standard format for a field guide to animals or plants.  For each cookie it provides the type, habitat (country the recipe is from), description, field notes (where the recipe came from, origin of name, etc.), and lifespan (how long the cookie will keep).  Of course it also has ingredients and directions for making the cookie, and total yield for the recipes.<br /><br />These are some truly creative recipes that children will love, like the Night Before Christmas Mice, which actually look like mice, and traditional favorites like snickerdoodles or pizzelles.  It even has a recipe for salt-dough ornament cookies - totally inedible but can be decorated to make permanent Christmas ornaments.  A Baker's Field Guide to Christmas Cookies is fun, creative, and recommended.	2004-12-01

As a result many of them made their own maps as they traveled.  The tremendous variety of these hand-drawn maps makes this collection of maps and historical information fascinating reading.<br /><br />The book is loosely organized along historical lines although maps with a similar theme are placed together.  For example, some of the chapters, and therefore map collections, include \\"Seeking Furs and Lost Souls, Finding the Mississippi, West from Carolina, Ascending the Missouri, Crossing the Mountains, Russian Alaska, The Emigrant Trails, and The Great Western Surveys.<br /><br />These are high quality copies of the original maps and a treasure to anyone interested in history.  It includes many well-written historical accounts of the explorers and other travelers to augment the maps.  While it is an excellent choice for a library addition, America Discovered:  A Historical Atlas of North American Exploration is a joy to read and belongs on the shelf of everyone interested in the history of the North America.	2004-12-01

This book attempts to include as much information as possible within the confines of a single volume work.  On the one hand it is great because you end up with a single volume with entries for just about anything you would want to look up.  On the other hand because there are so many entries many of them are not a very thorough treatment of the subject.  The book actually ends up with such short entries that it actually seems to fall somewhere between a dictionary and an encyclopedia, more than a dictionary entry, less than an encyclopedic entry.  With the occasional longer article that is very well done and more in line with a traditional encyclopedic entry, lots of photos, and listings for just about everything, every place, and everyone with links to Scottish history The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Scotland is still a recommended read for anyone interested in Scotland.	2004-11-01

There is nothing on how to install, troubleshoot, or administer Linux and it is not supposed to have that information.  This is a cookbook and is designed to be a resource when you have a specific goal in mind and want to know how to get there.  The first several chapters focus on the very basic Linux information that everyone working in the operating system should know.  This includes such common items as how to determine what processes are running and how to determine who you are logged in as.  Of course anyone with even a minimum of Linux experience knows this stuff.  For the more experienced Linux users the later chapters deal are a real treasure.  It includes things like viewing and editing images, PostScript, working with sound, and cross-platform conversions.  The recipe style layout really works well.  Like a list of ingredients the author lists the program to be run, package manager name for the installation package, and the home page where the package can be found.  This is one of the really nice features of the book.  If you are looking for how to accomplish a specific task you can look it up, see if there is a program to accomplish it, locate and install the program if necessary, and follow through the specific directions to achieve your desired result.  The Linux Cookbook, 2nd Edition is very highly recommended for the new Linux user, and recommended as a desk reference to keep available for the more experienced user who may just need to know how to convert that mp3 file to another format and burn the result to a CD.	2004-11-01

If you want to start earning a real living writing then one of the easiest paths is through copywriting.  That is the focus of the earlier book and this one.  In this book author Peter Bowerman takes a lot of the questions and success stories that were a result of his first book and provides the answers as well as how they did it.  Probably the most important part of this work is the detailed information on marketing yourself as a copywriter.  The first book gave you all the information on how to succeed at copywriting but was thin on how to market yourself.  This book makes up for that deficiency and does an excellent job at it.  With both books you have everything you need to start on a career in writing.<br /><br />The book contains multiple appendixes including a summary of the original Well-Fed Writer, selected profiles of people who have become successful in copywriting, business start-up information, and a selection of writing and marketing resources.  The Well-Fed Writer: Back for Seconds is a recommended purchase for anyone looking to make a career or additional income in writing and is an excellent follow-up to the original book.	2004-11-01

A quick turn to the correct page and the code was right there along with an explanation of how it works.  Twenty minutes later it was completely coded and working correctly.<br /><br />The author lists many common problems and for each of them provides a problem definition, a solution, and a discussion.  For many of the problems the author also includes a \\"See Also\\" section that points you to further reading.  With so many problems and solutions it is important to organize them in a way so they can be located quickly.  To achieve this goal the book is divided into ten distinct sections.  These sections are:  Web Typography, Page Elements, Links and Navigation, Lists, Forms, Tables, Page Layouts, Print, Hacks and Workarounds, and Designing with CSS.  A top quality cookbook title from O'Reilly Media, CSS Cookbook is a highly recommended read for anyone working with web pages and cascading style sheets.	2004-11-01

It starts by providing a cooking and healthy weight pyramid you can use to choose good eating habits and an appropriate weight related diet.  Each of the recipes also has a diagram indicating how many servings the meal should count for from each of the levels of the pyramid and a nutritional analysis.<br /><br />One of the really nice features is the inclusion of a section on how to plan a menu using the pyramid system with example menus.  With 150 recipes you are sure to find several that satisfy your palate.  Some of the ones that I enjoyed were Grilled Portobello Mushrooms with Thyme and Garlic, Roasted Root Vegetables with Cumin and Coriander, Pear and Toasted Pecan Chutney, and Spinach Lasagna with Sun-dried Tomato Sauce.  Most of the recipes have photographs of the finished meal so you know what it should look like.  The only thing I didn't like about the cookbook is that you can't tell quickly how much time is needed to prepare or cook the meal.  That is a very minor item given the ability to prepare delicious meals that contribute to your overall health.  The New Mayo Clinic Cookbook is a highly recommended cookbook for anyone wanting to eat well without sacrificing flavor.	2004-11-01

From basic landscaping to building benches, decks, sidewalks, steps, sprinklers, fences, and even walls there are several basic projects that will help to make your yard a place to relax and enjoy a quiet evening or a friendly get-together.  The instructions are easy to follow and detail every step to make sure your project is a success.  No special skills are required except the ability to follow instructions.  One thing I always look for in a book of this type is a lot of illustrations or photographs to show exactly how to do each step.  This book has plenty of both so you can make it perfect the first time.  Building Your Outdoor Home is a recommended purchase for any do-it-yourself types who want to personalize their outdoor living space.	2004-11-01

For some it would be a dependable, high-capacity small office server, for others it would be a top of the line video game machine, still others might define it as a dependable LAN workstation machine.  The perfect PC depends on your computing needs and the authors take this into consideration as they explain how to custom build any one of five types of PCs.  Throughout the book every step includes photograph after photograph detailing the process.<br /><br />One of the better features of the book is the fact that the authors give name brands and even suggested models for almost all of the hardware.  As a result you know you are getting the right quality for your dollar.  The authors don't attempt to make you an expert in computer building or hardware design, instead they teach you how to build a specific system for your needs complete with specific hardware recommendations.  This is a vast improvement over books that just tell you how to install a piece of hardware but leave you on your own when trying to find the right item.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like about the book was the fairly regular problems with writing style.  While the authors are to be commended for staying away from technical terms or at least explaining them before using them, sometimes they go too far the other way with the use of slang expressions.  A couple of illustrations will suffice to illustrate the problems.  Page 46 uses the sentence \\"... inexpensive Athlon XP models simply mop the floor with comparably priced Celerons.\\"  Or on page 179 a sentence reads \\"Fast Pentium 4 processors dissipate significant heat, ...\\".  Processors generate heat they don't dissipate it; heat sinks dissipate heat.  This is not the level of writing that I expect from O'Reilly.  Their books are top-notch professional publications and it is very rare to find one that at points reverts to this level of work.  Still none of the writing problems create an error that is likely to lead a reader off into the wrong direction so this should not be considered a major detraction from the book as much as it is a surprising anomaly from the publisher.<br /><br />Building the Perfect PC is recommended and one of the best choices for the true novice to use to assemble a PC, even given the writing problems listed above.ad a reader off into the wrong direction so this should not be considered a major detraction from the book as much as it is a surprising anomaly from the publisher. <br /> <br />Building the Perfect PC is recommended and one of the best choices for the true novice to use to assemble a PC, even given the writing problems listed above.	2004-11-01

The various chapters cover items like the wars, military, secrecy, the economy, the environment, education, health care, the judiciary, state of the Union, and our reputation.  Chapter 11 is particularly interesting as it shows the presidency \\"by the numbers\\".  Basically, it is a collection of statistical information in simple statement form which shows things like the number of treasury agents investigating Osama bin Laden's and Saddam Hussein's money (4), amount offered by a group of veterans to anyone who could confirm Bush's Alabama guard service ($3,500), etc.  A total of 404 different statistics are listed.  The included information comes from multiple reliable sources and Mr. Carter has done his homework documenting the sources.  At times it is obviously slanted, for example, the number of young adults that can't locate the Pacific Ocean on a map (30%) is a problem that we have known about for several years including well before Bush's presidency.  Relevant most of the time, a curiosity at other times, interesting all of the time, What We've Lost is a recommended read.	2004-10-18

With the cost of such testing going down all the time this becomes a reasonable way to determine if you are related to someone or not.  The text covers Y chromosome DNA testing to follow the father's side and mtDNA for information on the maternal side.  Of course you really need to understand how all of this applies to ancestry and the authors provide an excellent discussion of the various types of DNA tests, what they show, and even places where they can be ordered.  This includes a lengthy exposition of ancestry informative markers and their use.  Ancestry informative markers allow the tester to determine the percentage of their ancestry that came from a specific area.  So, the results of the test might indicate you are 70% Indo-European, 15% Sub-Saharan African, 10% East Asian and 5% Native American.  This does not tell you anything about specific ancestors but it does give you an idea of the makeup of your family history.  Since you are not going to be able to dig up ancient ancestors and test their DNA to see if you are related, the predominant use of the system at this point seems to be to determine if you are related to someone else who has the same surname (although you may never figure out exactly how) or to determine your ancestry mix with the information markers.  This book completely demystifies the use of DNA as a genealogical tool.  The appendixes include a glossary, where you can get specific tests performed, places where you can add your results to surname projects, sources for genealogical information, etc.  Trace Your Roots with DNA is highly recommended for anyone interested in their ancestry or genealogical research in general.	2004-10-18

But this is a view that Lewis and Clark could not see.  Almost all the pictures are from the viewpoint of a small aircraft flying over the landscape.  The photographs include everything from modern cities to landscapes that have not changed significantly from the time of their original explorations.  The text contains historic information about the trip and the sites photographed as well as details of the plane trip and current information.<br /><br />The photographs include beautiful patchwork landscapes, meandering rivers, forts Mandan and Union, the rough folds of the hills and canyons of the Missouri Breaks, the Rockies, and the Columbia River.  This aerial vantage point gives a different perspective on the difficulties and beauty of the terrain that Lewis and Clark traversed so many years ago.  Chasing Lewis & Clark Across America is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in the Lewis and Clark expedition or who just enjoys aerial photography.	2004-10-18

The first act is career exploration.  The base on which the rest of the \\"play\\" will rest is finding the right career for you.  Act two is implementing a successful career search so you can actually get the job you want.<br /><br />For many people the hardest part of finding the right career is deciding what that career should be.  Colleen A. Sabatino addresses that problem in the first part of her book by providing several questionnaires for the reader to fill in.  From the results of the questionnaires you determine many of the most critical factors to finding the career you want.  Some of the factors examined are your values, personality type, talents, interests, and fascinations.<br /><br />The next part (beginning of Act Two) is to develop a great resume and tailor it for the audience to whom you will be presenting it.  Of course the final part of the play is the actual production.  In this section she covers networking, the open job market vs. the hidden job market, and the interview process.<br /><br />For those who are seeking their first job or seeking to make a career change to a career where they can feel more satisfied this is a book they will want to look at.  The Play of Your Life is highly recommended to any career or job seekers.	2004-10-18

Is he lost?  Where is his mother?  A short children's story, Lost in the Woods combines nice, detailed photography with a story line that points out one of the reasons why a fawn might be alone in the woods.

With a handful of hidden animals to look for in the text it is also a fun challenge to find them all.  Lost in the Woods is highly recommended for young children.	2004-10-18

The instructions are written at a child's reading level and include how to measure ingredients, correctly break eggs, beating ingredients, testing for doneness, etc.  Even all the photographs are children doing the tasks.<br /><br />The recipes were obviously chosen to be ones that children like to eat and include cookies, breads, pretzels, pizza, pies, and cake.

Excellent photography, clear instructions, all the information you want is included at the end of each recipe - number of servings, preparation time, cooking time, skill level, and number of days it will keep.  All cookbooks should include this information along with the recipes.  This is the way a cookbook should be done.<br /><br />The book includes lots of traditional cake recipes as well as recipes you are not likely to find anywhere else without a great deal of effort.  Some of the recipes include Chocolate nut strudel, banana chocolate strudel, chocolate chip-amaretto cake, double chocolate brownies, Pennsylvania Dutch Funnel Cakes, and even Baklava.<br /><br />Since the entire book is about cakes, it is organized by the type of cake recipe.  Those types are butter cakes, pound cakes, chocolate cakes, fresh fruit and nut cakes, dried fruit & nut cakes, sponge cakes, festive cakes, meringue cakes, strudels, charlottes, cheesecakes, no-bake cakes, tarts, small cakes & muffins, yeast cakes, special cakes, fillings & frostings.<br /><br />Some people will have a problem with the small typeface of the ingredients list.  Make sure you can read it before ordering the book.  Other than that one small item, this is the epitome of the craft of cookbooks.  Cakes:  1001 Classic Recipes from Around the World is highly recommended.	2004-10-18

You will find lots of ideas in this book.  Starting with a cake mix you end up with brownies, cookies, muffins, and other items.  Or if you just want to take the basic cake recipe and make it into something unusual how about using fruit fillings in a cake, or applesauce, or Butterfinger candy bars.  The author also includes some children's recipes and other unique ideas like a Jack-O-Lantern cake that uses two bundt cakes with the flat side put together.<br /><br />The book is spiral bound to lay flat and has a protective plastic covering, as should all cookbooks.  101 Things to Do With a Cake Mix is recommended for anyone looking for creative ways to create the extraordinary from an ordinary cake mix.	2004-10-18

The authors did not limit themselves to just the nation of Israel but also include information on other nations that affected Israel such as Egypt, Syria, and, of course, Rome.<br /><br />Author Merrill C. Tenney does an excellent job of examining the details of Judaism, Hellenism, and the Roman culture and how the stresses between these systems affected the new church and Christian religion.  He also examines the various groups within the Jewish system - Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes.  To truly understand the purpose of many of the epistles of the New Testament you have to understand the various forms of paganism in the area and how these influenced social and political thought as well as the history, difficulties, leaders, and other situations surrounding the church.  The author provides a wealth of solid information about the Jerusalem and Antioch churches as well as how they grew and the doctrine of the early church solidified to become consistent between churches.<br /><br />The book contains a lot of pictures, maps, and illustrations to help the reader fully understand and appreciate the text.  The information is presented in a clear and understandable manner so it brings a solid understanding of the time period to the reader.  This in turn brings a better understanding of the scriptures.  New Testament Times is a highly recommended title and should be read by everyone desiring to understand the environment of the early church.	2004-10-15

Unless You Know to Ask	Books	5	13	13	N	N	I wish I could have read this several years ago	Medical Tests That Can Save Your Life: 21 Tests Your Doctor Won't Order... Unless You Know to Ask is exactly what as the title states.  Inside are nineteen conditions that are often not tested by doctors.  Each of the conditions gives a description of the physical condition, risk factors (separated by those that you can modify and those that you can't), your risk level, and tests you may want to request.  After the condition is explained in detail and the appropriate tests suggested, the book ends with a section that describes the tests including what the test checks for, how reliable it is, health risks, and approximate cost.  The final part of the book covers the standard treatment for the various conditions once they have been verified.<br /><br />One of the reasons these tests are often not given by doctors is because they don't show many symptoms until they are well advanced.  So how do you know you should request one of these tests?  The authors provide some of the circumstances under which you might want to request the test.  For example, hemochromatosis is most prevalent in people with a Celtic ancestry.  If you have a different ancestry you are unlikely to need to have the exam taken.<br /><br />Medical Tests That Can Save Your Life is a highly recommended book although I will have to admit that I am somewhat prejudiced.  I have several relatives whose lives would have been much better if someone had ordered the test for hemochromatosis earlier in their lives.	2004-10-15

It starts with an examination of the natural forces that shaped Scotland into the land it is today.  From ice age carved valleys to the incredible natural stone columns at Fingal's Cave it is a land of contrasts.  After examining the land the author turns to the most remote ancestral people of Scotland and the curious stone circles and other artifacts they left behind.  Moving forward in time they next examine the arrival of various more modern historical groups including the Celts, the Roman invaders, the Gaels, Picts, Britons, Angles, Vikings, and Normans.<br /><br />The author also examines the various social, cultural, and political changes Scotland went through and how things like the Industrial age, highland clearances, Scotland's role in WWI, the depression, population expansion and North Sea Oil changed the face of Scotland forever.  One of the particularly interesting chapters is one on how the Scottish people transitioned from tribal kingdoms to a more cohesive group and then united with the Picts to form a nation state and then united these kingdoms with England.<br /><br />Key individuals in the book include Saint Columba, MacBeth, William Wallace, Robert Bruce, and Robert Burns.  Throughout the book are beautiful pictures of landscapes, castles, abbeys, historical ruins, and modern structures that provide a visual history of Scotland.  Combined with the text it is a thorough and wonderfully written tribute and history to those of us with a Scottish ancestry.  The Illustrated History of Scotland is a top quality hardback book that should be on the shelf of everyone interested in Scottish history.	2004-10-15

Basically it takes seven of the most important principles of shepherding and relates them to managing productive people who want to work for you.  The seven principles are each set in their own chapter and covered in detail.  of Know the Condition of Your Flock, Discover the Shape of Your Sheep, Help Your Sheep Identify with You, Make Your Pasture a Safe Place, The Staff of Direction, The Rod of Correction, The Heart of the Shepherd.<br /><br />Basically by explaining various important aspects of good shepherding the authors provide solid object lessons in managing people.  Each chapter ends with a short synopsis of the major points.  There is a lot of wisdom concentrated in these seven principles and I found myself printing them out on a small card that I can carry with me.  The Way of the Shepherd is a highly recommended purchase and can be applied to many different kings of \\"flocks\\" - family, church, service groups, or any other group you care about.	2004-10-15

This book covers version 3.0, which, curiously enough, is not included with the book.  This is pretty unusual in the open-source world since it costs very little to put a copy of the program onto CD and bind it into the book.<br /><br />The reasons for SpamAssassin's popularity include its high level of customizability, the ability to change the rules and the weights assigned to those rules, automatically report spam to clearinghouses, ability to interface with other resources on the internet including DNS blacklists, ability to create a whitelist, and the ability to work with a wide variety of mail systems including sendmail, Postfix, qmail, and Exim.  One of the really nice features is the ability for the system to automatically add a person to the whitelist if you send an outgoing email to that person.<br /><br />Of course all of this requires an understanding of how SpamAssassin works and how to configure and tweak it to get it to do what you want.  That is where this book comes in.  The author has done an excellent job of explaining not only the concepts but also the details of how SpamAssassin works and how to tweak it to work best in your environment.  This is easily one of the most clearly written and understandable books on configuring the software that I have read.  SpamAssassin is highly recommended for anyone on a Unix-like system who is considering using the program as a spam control solution.<br /><br />It took some time to figure out how to configure it best for my needs but my spam is down over 90% with no false positives.  Don't expect the author to spoon feed you what is best for your system, but he gives you the information to design one that works for you.	2004-10-15

While there are many books and articles about how to reduce this problem, Jonathan Lund has taken his own personal war back to the spammers.  Instead of just deleting the emails he responds to them.  Of course he doesn't respond quite the way the spammers expect.  His responses are an attempt at humor and wit that often falls short of the mark, but then again at times is absolutely hysterical.<br /><br />Particularly funny is his correspondence with people who are naive enough to accept his satirical comments at face value.  His correspondence with textile manufacturers and the infamous Nigerian money launderer is brilliant.<br /><br />With writing that covers the whole range from a poor attempt at humor to laugh-out-loud funny, to bizarre, the reader is sure to find several emails entertaining no matter what your preference in humor.  The Spam Letters is a recommended read.	2004-10-15

The first section includes a wealth of information on critical factors for a successful garden.  Some of the items discussed include climate, rainfall, wind, sun, soil type, drainage, and garden design.<br /><br />The Plant Portraits section is by far the largest section of the book and grouped by annuals and biennials, perennials, bulbs, roses, vegetables, herbs, groundcovers, and vines.  For each plant the authors include descriptions (height, colors, etc.), tips for growing (when to plant, how to thin, transplanting, etc.), and other useful information.  It also has a small section of photographs for several of the more common plants.<br /><br />The Practical Gardener section primarily covers equipment, pests, and diseases.  The pests and diseases portion is good in that it covers characteristics, symptoms, hosts, and controls.  While not a very thorough treatment of the pests and diseases it does cover the most common ones.  The last part of this section has an excellent listing of plants organized by environmental preferences and uses.  For example, it lists appropriate plants for bright sunny areas and for thickly shaded areas as well as ones to use for a cutting garden, for attracting butterflies, etc.<br /><br />If you are looking for a smaller book that is easy to take along to the garden center but thorough enough to have all the most common information you can't go wrong with the Burpee Gardening Cyclopedia.	2004-10-15

I've reviewed cookbooks on slow-cookers before but this one has quickly become one of my favorites.  The recipes are divided into various categories including beverages, dips and fondue, soups, and stews, beef, chicken, pork, and desserts.<br /><br />The book starts with 22 helpful hints for cooking with a slow cooker.  The actual recipes follow and there are a lot of really good ones.<br /><br />For example, I don't generally like pot roast but there is a recipe for cola roast that is really good.  It also has some unusual recipes like peanut butter fondue, or Sante Fe cheese soup.  Not only are there unusual recipes but many good recipes that one would not normally associate with a slow cooker.  For example there are recipes for French Dip sandwiches, Italian chicken and mushrooms, sweet and sour pork, carrot cake, and pineapple upside-down cake.<br /><br />The only thing that I would like to see is the cooking time put at the top of the recipe with the ingredients instead of buried in the recipe instructions.  This is particularly important with slow-cooker recipes because they can require anything from half an hour to twelve hours or more of cooking.  It does have a nice plastic cover to make it easy to wipe off and food matter that might get on it.  One of the best slow-cooker cookbooks around, 101 Things to Do With a Slow Cooker is highly recommended.	2004-10-15

I have also programmed in Python to meet some basic needs for processing web site input.  If you want to move several steps beyond basic Python programming into the realm of network programming you will find this book one of the best resources available today.  The coverage of networking with Python is very thorough and includes TCP/IP and UDP protocols, sockets, server connections, DNS queries, broadcast data, Ipv6, web client access, parsing, working with xml, email, MIME, SMTP, SSL, POP, IMAP, FTP, SQL databases, SocketServer, SimpleXMLRPCServer, CGI, mod_python, multitasking, and asynchronous communication.  As is typical of Apress books, there is a lot of specific code examples to help the reader see exactly how it should be done.<br /><br />Foundations of Python Networking Programming is highly recommended if you already have a familiarity with networking concepts and basic Python programming.  This is a second level book that should be used to extend your knowledge and programming skills after first learning the basics of Python with something like Diving Into Python.	2004-10-15

That is the question answered in The Irritable Male Syndrome by best-selling author Jed Diamond.  In the book he describes how the syndrome is diagnosed, what to expect, and how to treat it.  Current research shows that the four primary factors for Irritable Male Syndrome are changing testosterone levels, chemical imbalances, loss of masculine identity, and stress.<br /><br />This book exposes the emotions and thoughts in the deepest parts of many men.  While some may control those emotions and so not exhibit irritable male syndrome, the book still does an excellent job of describing many of the stresses and emotional traits of men as well as offering explanations and ways to deal with them.  This is by far one of the best self-help, psychology based books I have read this year and one of the best I have ever read.  The Irritable Male Syndrome is very highly recommended and should be read by all women who want to understand their husband, boyfriend, or significant other as well as those who may be suffering with the syndrome or those who love them.	2004-10-15

While there are many guides on the market today the best ones have an abundance of photographs or detailed illustrations to help the reader see what they are supposed to be doing.  With over 2,300 photos Black and Decker's The Complete Photo Guide to Home Repair is the epitome of this class of books.  Processes and techniques are described step by step in detail with no prior knowledge assumed.  Everything is so well done anyone can complete any of the projects if they can read and follow directions.  I've had several home repair books, but this one just became my top choice for the one I want to have around as my primary reference.  The Complete Photo Guide to Home Repair is a very highly recommended book for every homeowner or handyman.	2004-10-15

A friend was dying in the hospital when he called Mr. Batchelor to his side and in fear asked about the purpose of life, where we go when we die, and similar questions.  Realizing that people often ask this question as they near the end of life he thought it would be good to share these answers earlier in life so they can better enjoy life.  With that as the goal he wrote The Purpose of Life.<br /><br />Some of the questions he examines include: Who am I, where do I come from, and what is my purpose on earth?  Some readers will have problems with his theology and so should read the book before recommending it to others.  An example of a position some would have difficulty with is the answer to the question of where we come from.  He believes that we existed in heaven with God before we were born and God put us into our earthly body while wiping out our memory of being in heaven.  His concepts of paradise and prison at death and Jesus' role there as well as other items represent doctrinal positions that are not held by many Christians.  Some groups (Mormons for example) will have very few problems with it and are likely to recommend it; others will have various levels of difficulty with the content.	2004-10-13

More than just what can happen, it details each attack so you learn the purpose of the attack as well as how it is carried out.  Each of the chapters provides the fictional account of an individual who takes on a single network attack.  What the reader soon discovers is that it is actually a carefully orchestrated chain of attacks with a larger purpose in mind.<br /><br />One of the things I really liked about the book is that it is not just a dry security book turned into a more interesting novel but it gives the reader a look at the personalities of those who get involved in these things.  Each of the attacks involves real tools that can be downloaded or purchased off the Internet as well as real techniques.  If you want to know how an attacker thinks and how far they will go to achieve their goals as well as some of the common techniques you can't go wrong with Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent.	2004-10-13

One of the things I really liked about the book was that it not only tells the reader how to secure their network but also tells them how to test the system using specific techniques and tools.  This includes footprinting a network with tools like whois and DNS interrogation, monitoring traffic, and sniffing.  The other great feature of the book is that it includes vendor specific attacks and defenses - the things the vendor won't be telling you.  Some of the vendors mentioned include Check Point, PIX, Microsoft ISA Server, NetScreen, and Novell.<br /><br />The authors also examine routing devices and protocols, network management and security, IPSec, VPNs, and security software.  In addition to the internal network considerations the authors look at the items on the edge of the local network.  These items include network switches and routers, including attacks and defenses by brand.  They complete the book with a good discussion of internal network design including the importance of firewall selection and placement, Intrusion Detection Systems, and segmentation.  Security Sage's Guide to Hardening the Network Infrastructure is highly recommended for people interested more in how to secure a network than how to hack one as well as how to test that security.	2004-10-13

This monumental task was undertaken by surveying people around the United States to get their answers to multiple questions (statistical results are presented in an appendix).  From the results of these questionnaires author Thom S. Rainer divides unchurched people into five distinct groups.  These groups run the range from those who would attend if someone would invite them to those who are openly hostile to the gospel and people who attend church.<br /><br />Thom S. Rainer is a dean at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, a fact that he reminds the reader of on a regular basis throughout the text.  Other than that one minor annoyance, the information is extremely valuable to anyone involved in church growth and outreach.  I found some of the numbers to be surprising and some pretty much what I expected.  Either way, the analysis was consistently insightful.  The Unchurched Next Door is a highly recommended book for anyone charged with growing their church and its influence in the surrounding area.	2004-10-13

The eight courses are divided into four Old Testament courses (Exploring the Pentateuch, Exploring the Historical Books, Exploring the Books of Poetry, Exploring the Books of Prophecy) and four New Testament courses (Exploring the Life of Christ, Exploring the Ministry of Christ, Exploring Paul's Letters to Churches, Exploring the Other Letters and Revelation).  In addition there are 150 \\"Study Centers\\" to help you gain a deeper understanding of the passages and broaden your perspective.<br /><br />Each study center has a full page dedicated to it at the location where the first verses occur.  They are all similar in format and include background information, keys to understanding the most important parts of the study, assignments to complete to further your understanding, and a verse that summarizes the spiritual significance of that particular study.  The study does not necessarily stay with the order of the Bible.  For example, the Psalms have chapters that are related to instruction (1, 19, 119), the Reign of God (2, 72, 93, 95-100, 117, 146), the depths of despair (3, 13, 88, 130), etc.  So while the study in the Psalms does not go chapter by chapter it takes the reader along a consistent theme.  If, on the other hand, you have a Psalm you like and would like to investigate others that are part of that same study group then you can look at the upper right corner of the page and it indicates the appropriate study center and the page on which to locate it.  This is an excellent method of Bible study which I have not seen done in this manner anywhere else.<br /><br />The Discovery Study Bible uses the New International Version translation and includes many other Bible study tidbits like \\"Culture Clues\\" and \\"Closer Look\\" that are similar to other study Bibles.  At the end are self tests and a dictionary where various word meanings are detailed as well as how they should be interpreted in a particular context.<br /><br />An excellent study Bible, The Discovery Study Bible is a highly recommended Bible for anyone from teenagers to adults.as well as how they should be interpreted in a particular context. <br /> <br />An excellent study Bible, The Discovery Study Bible is a highly recommended Bible for anyone from teenagers to adults.	2004-10-10

Living a balanced fulfilled life with a loving and peaceful attitude is possible, but sacred selfishness is required.  Everyone needs time to look at their self and examine their life, passions, plans, etc.  Sacred selfishness is not selfishness with a negative connotation.  It is taking the time to retreat for yourself, taking the time to reclaim balance in your life.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts - Breaking the Mold and Seeking a Path, Cultivating Inner Substance, and Cultivating a Life of Substance.  The chapter titles also give a good idea of the direction the book takes.  Some titles include The Call to Transformation, Preparing for Change, Journaling as Inner Exploration, Beginning the Search for Personal Substance, Befriending Our Dreams, Learning to Love Ourselves, and Relationships of Substance.<br /><br />This is a book of such substance that I found myself reading a section, stopping to think about it, and then reading another section.  For a person who reads a typical book in about an hour it is rare that I find one of such substance that it takes me almost a week to read it carefully so I can be sure to extract all the value out of it I can.  Sacred Selfishness is very highly recommended to anyone seeking balance and fulfillment in their life.	2004-10-10

However, this one has one particular feature that sets it apart from other ones I have examined.  Even with each word translated beneath the Greek word the Greek sentence structure can still make it difficult to correctly translate a sentence.  To help with this problem when words need to be reordered so they conform to English rules then the text includes a number by each of the words so you can easily put them in the appropriate sequence.  This is a very helpful feature.<br /><br />In addition to the interlinear translation on the right side of each page is the New King James Version translation for the passages on that page.  This makes it easy to go from the Greek to the translation of each word and then to the final translated text.<br /><br />At the back of the book is a section titled Word Studies, but it is more like a basic dictionary than a true word study.  Each entry has the Greek word, transliteration, definition, and a single reference in the New Testament.<br /><br />While the Word Studies section may be of minimal value the rest of the text is excellently done with idioms also combined and translated.  With the sequencing of the words and translation of idioms in addition to the expected word for word translation \\"The NKJV Greek-English Interlinear New Testament\\" is a highly recommended purchase for anyone looking for an Interlinear Bible.	2004-10-10

Sometimes a minor change that fixes a bug at one point causes other portions of the program to have problems.  Revision control systems allow you keep various versions of your program and go back to a prior version easily.  If there are multiple people working on the project then the ability to commit changes and see what happens but easily get back to where you were becomes even more important.  If you are writing a modular program then as each person or group changes their module you may need to get a current version of the project with a prior version of a module.  A revision control system handles all these problems easily.  Subversion is an open source version control system that can be used on any operating system that supports the Apache httpd server including Windows, Linux, and NetWare.<br /><br />Version Control with Subversion is a highly useful book written with a slant toward the Linux OS.  It is easy to read and understand if you are at least familiar with version control software at a theoretical level and is highly recommended.  One really nice feature is an appendix covering the differences between Subversion and the popular CVS software.  If you are used to CVS then this appendix makes the switch to Subversion much easier.	2004-10-10

John R. Kohlenberger III and James A. Swanson took on this task and have made several improvements.  The first thing they did was to fix several minor errors in previous versions.  Then they included words that were italicized in the Cambridge King James Version.  This is important because these represent words that were not in the original text but were supplied in translation to help the reader understand the text.  Finally, they computer verified the accuracy of the text.  Because of this they state that this is the most accurate Strong's concordance to ever be published.<br /><br />Really nice features include sensitivity to translational problems such as the need to sometimes use multiple words to translate a single word because the destination language doesn't contain a similar word.  Because of this problem these multiple words are included as a set and matched against the Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek word.<br /><br />The Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek dictionaries have also been updated from previous editions to reflect current Biblical scholarship.  At the back of the book are some additional reference materials that are pretty unusual for a concordance.  These materials include things like a Hebrew calendar, sacred days listing, weights and measures information, and a harmony of the gospels.<br /><br />Still the best King James concordance available and the best value for your money The Strongest Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible is highly recommended.<br /><br />I've read some of the reviews here that indicate problems with this concordance including the one that complains that it does not have the reference to Luke in Philemon 1:24.  Please take the time to note that this is a concordance of the King James Version and so it says Lucas and not Luke in that passage, etc.	2004-10-10

The cookbooks are not for the person who wants to learn how to program in a particular language, but are very useful for programmers with a basic knowledge of the language.  The idea is simple, take the most common problems people deal with and put the solutions into a book.  Simply state the problem and then show the code to resolve it.  So, if you need to know how to do something you can look it up, enter the code, and test it.<br /><br />Some of the chapter subjects include Interacting with the Environment, Strings and Things, Pattern Matching, Numbers, Dates and Times, Object-Oriented Techniques, Directory and Filesystem Operations, Graphics and Sound, Network Clients, Server-Side Java, Database Access, XML, and Threaded Java.  Typical of any of the programming cookbooks, it is a quick and easy source for answers.  Each item has a short explanation of the problem and then goes straight to the code to demonstrate how it works.  A great time saver and required resource for Java programmers, Java Cookbook, 2nd Edition is highly recommended.	2004-10-10

The first volume examines the various ethnic cultures and their related religious heritage.  It includes African American religions, Asian American religious communities, Buddhism in America, Catholicism in America, Hinduism in America, Islam in American, Judaism in America, Latina/Latino religious communities, Native American religions, new age, new religious traditions, orthodox Christianity, and Protestantism in America.  This is not a doctrinal exposition on the beliefs of these groups but a scholastic examination of their formation, traditions, and effect on American culture as well as the American culture's effect on the religious practices.<br /><br />Volume two examines religion from a different perspective.  This volume looks at religious thought about the body, piercing, tattooing, pain, death, mourning rituals, roadside shrines, generational aspects of religion, popular culture, political culture, rituals, sacred space, sacred time, science, sexuality, violence and many others areas.<br /><br />Volume three examines some of the most important historical documents related to our religious beliefs and culture.

While there are several books available now on how to live in the present moment and so transform your life, this one takes on a different application of that principle by examining how it applies to relationships.  Of course the authors start where all good relationship books should start - examine your self first.  A relationship involves both people and that means your self.<br /><br />Using three principles of transformation they seek to show how people can bring about change in their lives and their relationships.  One of the most important points they make is that your relationship with your self determines your relationship with others.  Some of the other points they examine are recognizing and dealing with your hidden agendas, completing your relationship with your parents, realizing that you are not the story of your life, the art of listening, and choosing to be alive.<br /><br />This is a well-written book with lots of positive self-affirming directions and is the first of the self-help books about living in the moment that effectively tackles the problem of relationships.  Working on Your Relationship Doesn't Work is a highly recommended book with an unfortunate title that doesn't encourage picking it up off the shelf and reading it.	2004-10-10

One of the advantages of Enterprise JavaBeans and similar approaches to programming is it allows for faster development of code.  However, there is a price to be paid for this programming convenience.  The price is generally large bloated code.  With each line of code the speed of the application slows down, the size of the program increases, and more opportunities for errors are introduced.  Better, Faster, Lighter Java sounds the clarion call for better code writing, project management, and maintenance.  The authors also include chapters on other open-source products, such as Hibernate and Spring, which can help keep the code clean and build projects using a container model like EJB without all the unnecessary overhead.  Better, Faster, Lighter Java is a highly recommended book for Java programmers.	2004-10-10

The change has to start with each one of us as individuals.  Be nice and, as a result, be happy.  Not only will you be happy, but others will also want to be around you because you make them feel happier.  Being nice is good for everyone.<br /><br />The ideas and suggestions in the book are not so esoteric as to be unrealistic.  Instead it has practical examples of how to become a genuinely nice person.  Basically it is an instructional book on how to make kindness a part of your everyday life.<br /><br />One of the important things at the beginning of the book is a definition of what a truly nice person is and is not.  For example, a person who is nice to you but not nice to the waitress is not a genuinely nice person.<br /><br />The process is a step-by-step method for change.  The first step is learning to be nice to your self.  Next is boosting your self-esteem.  You boost your self-esteem by creating balance in your life - professionally, physically, emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually.<br /><br />Be Nice (or Else) and What's In It For You is highly recommended for every reader.	2004-10-10

In it the editors make the point that Christianity is a religion that believes in a God who acts in history.  Most of the stories in the Bible are set in specific historical contexts and are designed to show God working with individuals and groups in a historical context.  Because history is so bound up in the Bible stories it is impossible to read the Bible without addressing the issue of history.<br /><br />Sometimes the particular historical view that a reader holds affects their interpretation of Bible passages.  This is one of the primary areas this book examines - biblical hermeneutics with an eye toward the relationship between faith and history and how that relationship both affected how historical events were reported and how biblical events are interpreted.<br /><br />This is a scholarly collection of articles that is written in an academic style and highly suitable for Bible colleges and Seminaries more than the average reader.  Behind the Text: History and Biblical Interpretation is recommended for the serious Bible student.	2004-10-10

A child can place the decoder that comes with the book over the hidden word and read it.  Now reading and learning about the Bible story can be an adventure.  Of course the first concern many parents would have is how easy is it to lose the special decoder?  The book has a special place for the decoder so it can be returned there and stored securely.  However, if it does become lost then a quick trip to the hardware store to pick up some red cellophane and you have a new decoder; maybe not as fancy as the fish that comes with the book, but totally functional.  Brightly colored illustrations add to the appeal of the book and together with the adventure of the secret words it makes this a very highly recommended book.	2004-10-10

The book provides a view of the Bible as a consistent story with mountain peak highs followed by low valleys.  Throughout the book part of the focus is on pointing out a single thread flowing through the Bible.  That single thread is a plan of redemption.  The book is divided into three parts with part 1 covering the Old Testament, part 2 covering the New Testament, and part 3 dealing with living in the Spirit.<br /><br />For most people who have been Christians for a long time this is too general a view of the Bible and will provide nothing they don't already know.  However, for young Christians or a class for new Christians Unlock the Bible in 30 Days is a recommended read that ties the various Bible stories into a consistent theme.	2004-10-10

After teaching a Sunday School class which started large and declined until it had almost no attendees, he found that experiential storytelling techniques brought people back in droves and allowed him to share the message of Christ in new and innovative ways.<br /><br />Experiential Storytelling methods allow people to experience the story of Christ instead of sermonizing.  This in turn makes the Bible more real to others.  While many churches are stuck in a pattern that is hard to change and people in general tend to be resistant, youth groups are generally more open and the techniques in this book could easily be used there or in the Sunday School setting.  Then, who knows, perhaps it will move into the primary service.  Experiential Storytelling is highly recommended and church leaders should at least be aware of the techniques and potential.	2004-10-10

Each Bible book has a quick guide that includes information on author, type of book, purpose, and primary point.  Throughout the book are lots of notes, maps, puzzling verses, and details on government and customs.  One of the really nice features are the multiple boxes labeled viewpoints.  These contain information on different interpretations for particular passages.<br /><br />This is one of the most complete and accessible study sources for the average Bible student.  While it is not a Bible in itself, it is designed to be used in conjunction with your Bible.  The MAP: Making the Bible Meaningful, Accessible, Practical is a very highly recommended read for Bible students who seek a solid overview and understanding of the books of the Bible and how each of the stories relates to the other.  It is not a deep hermeneutic treatise with detailed word studies, but a solid book that truly makes the Bible meaningful, accessible, and practical for everyone.	2004-10-10

The layout for most of the sections is pretty similar.  The author describes the problem, related problems, things you can do, and resources to help.  For example if you have vision troubles then you might consider talking clocks, timers, or thermometers, talking blood-pressure monitors, voice-activated phone dialers, etc.  The problem is where would you acquire these things since they are often not available in most stores.  The resources section has the answers with web sites and phone numbers.  This is just one of the many areas the book addresses.  Other common problems and areas of concern for seniors that are addressed include: driving and transportation, utility assistance, telemarketing fraud, identity theft, grandparenting, money management, travel, fall prevention, retirement communities, choosing a nursing home, various medical concerns, Medicare, and Social Security.  The two most valuable features of this book are the fact that it provides somewhat of a checklist of things you need to consider as you plan for aging and it points you in the right direction to get credible, quality help when you need it.  The Savvy Senior is recommended for seniors and those making plans for their retirement years.	2004-10-10

The broad range of areas covered include making fire, making cordage (from vegetable and animal sources), making tools, tanning, flintknapping, making dyes and colors, baskets, bowls, pottery, food and cooking, soap, music, and clothing.<br /><br />Each chapter provides everything you need to know to complete a couple of projects of that genre but is hardly a thorough treatment of the subject.  For example the food and cooking, animals, and getting dressed sections each could easily consume two or three books and there are many on the market that do.  What this book provides is a thorough introduction to the skills and the ability to develop confidence by going through several projects.<br /><br />Although most areas are not covered in detail, some areas are covered better than any other book of this nature I have seen.  For example, fire, cordage, baskets, buckets, and bowls are all treated in detail.  It contains an unusually good section on flintknapping and an excellent section on making fire.  While the techniques are mentioned in other books this is the first one I have read that provided sufficient information to figure out what you are doing wrong if it doesn't work.  For example the first several times I tried to create a fire with friction I only created a glazed effect on the wood.  This is the only book that mentioned what caused it and what to do about it.<br /><br />For anyone wanting a broad introduction of all the basic skills of primitive living, Earth Knack is a highly recommended book.	2004-10-10

Part of the suite, OpenOffice.org Writer is the word processor component and the only one covered in this book.  The book does include a CD-ROM with a copy of OpenOffice.org for various operating systems including Linux, Mac, Solaris, and Windows.  This book is a thorough introduction to the Writer software and includes configuration, writing, editing, review, page layout, templates, styles, fields, table of contents, indexes, bibliographies, and working with graphics.  Basically, just about everything that you are likely to use in a business environment is covered.  Some things are easier done in OpenOffice than in Word, and some are easier in Word.  I did find that after spending about an hour with the software I was able to do everything I normally do in Word plus create a much more efficient interface to merge data from a dbase file into a template for a mail merge.  I was a pleasure working with a product that interfaced well with other programs, something Microsoft products are not generally known for doing well, if at all.  My experience with the software was very positive and the book a tremendous help at greatly lowering the learning curve.  OpenOffice.org Writer is a highly recommended book for anyone thinking about looking at this product as an alternative to Microsoft Office.	2004-09-30

Within its pages the authors detail a plan to help the reader find a place they can call their church.  The book is divided into three parts.  The first part examines the church itself from a Biblical perspective and its purpose on the earth.  The second part looks at various types of congregations you are likely to encounter.  And the third part is about finding your place among God's People.<br /><br />At the end of each chapter are actions you can take, direction for prayer to assist you, questions for reflection, and sometimes even tools to help you evaluate yourself and a church service to see if it is a place where you will be happy.  In chapter nine they end up with five specific steps to find the church you can love.  At the end of that chapter they even include questions to ask a leader at a potential church home so you can start the visiting process with a short list of those who are probably a good match with your family.  Highly recommended path to find that church you love while still addressing the importance of prayer to help you find God's will for you in a church.  Finding a Church You Love and Loving the Church You've Found is highly recommended.	2004-09-30

Basic Newtonian physics are used to explain what happens when two players of different mass collide, the best pursuit patterns, ball spiral, and even why passes go further in the Denver Broncos stadium when compared to Giants Stadium.  Or conversely, he uses football to explain Newtonian physics.  Either way, by approaching the subject from the standpoint of a common background (football) the author makes basic physics easy to comprehend.<br /><br />Football Physics: The Science of the Game is a thoroughly enjoyable book and a great way to introduce students to physics in a way that illustrates its application in every day life.  I wish a book like this had been available when I was first learning physics, it would have been a lot more fun.	2004-09-30

Each of the fifteen chapters examines one of the common uses of Perl and provides sufficient detail to actually write some pretty sophisticated programs.  It is pretty much impossible to do anything of any value in Perl without understanding data types, operators, and variables so these are all covered first.  From there the reader enters the world of flow control constructs, lists and arrays, hashes, subroutines, and functions.  This section includes information on passing arguments, an area that is left out of a lot of beginning books and is an exercise in frustration trying to find out how to do.  The reader next moves on to regular expressions, file and data handling, string processing, interfacing with the operating system, and references.  Finally the book winds up with object-oriented Perl, modules, CGI, and using Perl with DBI to interact with a SQL database.<br /><br />The book is well written with lots of code examples so you can see exactly how something should be written to work correctly.  While you might want a Perl cookbook to help resolve particular problems when you come across them, Beginning Perl, Second Edition is a great choice to move from no knowledge or little knowledge of Perl to becoming an intermediate Perl user.  It is highly recommended to anyone wanting to acquire a well-rounded foundation in Perl.	2004-09-30

The Child Safety Guide for New and Expecting Parents examines how to prepare for your new child and protect them from harm.  The author covers many areas of child safety including childproofing your house (cabinets, electrical outlets, stairs, etc.), purchasing a child friendly crib, car seats, choking, poison, and water hazards.  Especially for a new parent there are many things that are often overlooked.  It would seem reasonable to assume that a child's walker or an older child's bunk bed is safe, but they often are not.  Because of this, Christian J. Bezick also takes a close look at safety considerations for bunk beds, walkers, toy chests, playpens, and other common equipment and furniture for children.  The Child Safety Guide for New and Expecting Parents is a highly recommended resource for all new parents.	2004-09-30

The author takes you right into Python by going through installation in the first chapter and you are already writing a program in the second chapter.  This is a book designed for the person who wants to just jump in and get right to work with Python without a lot of preliminary theoretical work.  That makes it an ideal book for anyone who has written programs before in Perl, Java, or other languages and already understands things like flow control and similar programming constructs.<br /><br />The book starts with the basics and by the end has given the reader a good foundation in Python.  Areas covered include declaring functions, dictionaries, lists, variables, string formatting, objects, importing modules, working with classes, exceptions, file objects, loops, regular expressions, html processing, xml processing, scripts and streams, http web services, SOAP web services, refactoring, and dynamic functions.  With lots of code examples it is easy to follow along with the text and begin writing useful programs quickly.<br /><br />This is a basic text on Python.  It includes everything you need to start programming basic programs.  There are more advanced books available but they all tend to assume that you at least have this foundational knowledge in order to understand how they use Python to access a database or make your program network aware with TCP/IP functions, or similar more advanced functions.  If you are new to Python this is an excellent place to start and get up to speed quickly by actually working with the program from the first day.  Dive Into Python is a highly recommended purchase.	2004-09-30

The big advantage is the ability to take content and publish it in various formats from a single source.  As a general rule when you are talking about XML you are talking about using Java to implement it.  AxKit gives the user the ability to publish XML documents using Perl.  That means that you will have to have Perl installed to use it.  Basically the prerequisites are an Apache server, the mod_perl Apache extension module, an XML parser written in Perl or in C with a Perl interface module, and the AxKit distribution.  One you have all that put together and functioning you can start using the book to learn how to publish XML documents with AxKit.  The actual techniques in the book are straightforward and well explained.  If you are familiar with Perl there is nothing complex here, just a few different things to learn but nothing bizarre.  With plenty of sample scripts so you can follow along and write your own following the examples XML Publishing with AxKit is a recommended read for people who are very familiar with Perl and want to get up and running with XML publishing with the minimum of effort.	2004-09-30

In the first one the authors discuss the common elements in most healthy and mutually supportive relationships.  The second part examines where you are in your relationship and provides a reality check for that relationship.  The final part provides additional information for getting help, and selecting an appropriate therapist if you want to take that direction.<br /><br />The book begins with a partners' agreement that states \\"Both partners in a relationship are individual human beings and deserve to be treated that way\\".  This is part of the ground rules for a relationship and the mutual respect that is absolutely required for a healthy relationship.  After this they provide a quiz that can be used to help determine where you are in your relationship.  It starts with determining what rights you should have and should not have in a relationship.  After all, \\"if you don't know what is right they how do you know when something is wrong?\\"  So they establish a baseline for the things that should exist.<br /><br />The relationship rights are divided into three categories using the metaphor of a traffic light.  Green rights are ones that you should have in your relationship.  They are part of what makes you unique and part of who you are and represent rights that should be protected.  Yellow rights are benefits from the relationship that you should be receiving.  If you are not receiving enough of them then it is an area that needs to be examined.  Red rights are ones that are related to safety and you should have them to protect yourself.  If they do not exist in the relationship then there is a major problem.  This is arguably one of the most important parts of this book.  It provides guidance about what you should expect in your relationship and a valuable checklist to determine where things may be wrong.<br /><br />Relationship Rights (and wrongs): A Guide to the Best Possible Relationship and a Reality Check When it Isn't is a recommended read.  It may not be the best on determining what to do to fix a relationship but it is very good in helping to pinpoint what is wrong.heck When it Isn't is a recommended read.

Not just a book about troubleshooting, the introductory portion provides a strong education in the Cisco hierarchal approach, the layered troubleshooting approach, and the problem resolution model approach.<br /><br />This is followed by a solid explanation of protocol behavior and characteristics.  Chapter three starts the actual diagnostic mechanisms and Cisco TCP/IP commands.  Chapter four then covers diagnostic tools including network monitors, simulation tools, and Cisco IOS diagnostics.  The next several chapters involve troubleshooting the actual protocols including TCP/IP, IGRP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP.  The final chapter involves troubleshooting in a redistribution routing environment.<br /><br />Some of the strongest reasons for recommending this book include the realistic scenarios for every size network, the straight-forward and efficient troubleshooting methodology proposed, and the thoroughness of the material.  The text covers all the essential material tested in the Cisco exam Internet Troubleshooting Support.<br /><br />Loaded with illustrations so you can visualize what is happening and understand the concepts easily, this is an excellent book for anyone working with Cisco routers.  The included CD contains a study program with multiple-choice questions to test your knowledge, the source code for all code in the book, all the tables and illustrations in the book.

While there are several excellent books on learning to read New Testament Greek (Koine Greek) but they all have the limitation inherent in any book about learning another language.  No matter how well the author describes how to pronounce a word, where to put emphasis, or how to deal with diphthongs it is not the same a hearing it.  On these two audio CDs Jonathan T. Pennington reads various passages in Koine Greek including the Sermon on the Mount, and the entire book of 1 John.  If you have William Mounce's book \\"A Graded Reader of Biblical Greek\\" you will find all the passages mentioned there read aloud on this CD.  While nobody is sure exactly how Koine Greek was pronounced, Dr. Pennington uses the most commonly accepted Erasmian pronunciation, which keeps the student in line with the majority of scholars.  \\"Readings in the Greek New Testament\\" is highly recommended for anyone desiring to learn New Testament Greek and a great companion for anybody using William Mounce's book.	2004-09-28

When a young child has a question they generally turn to their parents, but when the parents say they can't take them somewhere, or see them more often, or otherwise satisfy the needs of the child because the court system constrains them they have to take other measures.  These children took their pleas to the judge.  Encouraging, disheartening, and enlightening, \\"Dear Judge\\" should be read by judges, parents, and attorneys alike.	2004-09-28

To make this transition easier it is important to have a book where the storyline is very strong and keeps their interest.  Down Girl and Sit: Smarter than Squirrels fits this bill perfectly.  Writing from the point of view of a dog (Down Girl) the author is meticulous about never getting out of character.  This perspective makes the book both humorous and fun.  Everything a dog does is examined from a totally different point of view that will leave children spellbound.  Not just for children it is a fun and entertaining read for adults too.  Open your mind, enjoy some creative thinking, and just have some plain old-fashioned fun.  Down Girl and Sit is highly recommended.	2004-09-25

These are animals whose existence has not been proven at this time.  While the idea that there may be animals, including some very large ones, living in the world and we have no proof of their existence might be strange to some people it was during my lifetime that gorillas and rhinoceroses were removed from the category of fables.<br /><br />For each entry the editors provide information on its physical description, behavior, distribution, possible explanations, significant sightings, and sources.  This is a non-judgmental review of the reports from around the world presented in a typical encyclopedic style.  Although it contains primarily creatures reported to exist but not proven it also includes some animals like the Dodo bird, which were known to exist and are believed extinct.  But, because there have been occasional reported sightings in recent years these animals are included.<br /><br />ABC-CLIO, Inc. published some of the best educational materials of this type on the market today.  As always Mysterious Creatures: A Guide to Cryptozoology is a high quality reference work written at a high-school level and so is accessible to everyone.  Mysterious Creatures is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in this area and a recommended purchase for libraries.	2004-09-25

That is a tragedy.  I reluctantly picked it up to read a chapter or two only because it was sent to me and I have a reputation of at least reading one chapter of all books sent for review no matter how bad.<br /><br />My first impression could not have been more wrong.  Instead of reading a chapter and putting it away I found that I couldn't put it down until I had finished.  An autobiographical account of the shattered life of Christa Bissell and a joyous tribute to the triumph of love, it is deeply moving and draws the reader into her private life as a close friend.  If I had missed this book I would have missed one of the best autobiographical books I read all year.  Through My Ears Into My Soul is highly recommended.	2004-09-25

The purpose is to give you the materials and let you discover the truth for yourself.  You won't find pages of doctrinally influenced information, but will find plenty of maps, charts, graphs, historical notes, detailed grammatical notes, illustrations, and a concordance.  At the end of each book is an \\"At a Glance\\" page.  You can fill in the chapter themes and other notes.  The translation used is the updated New American Standard Bible.  For a doctrinally neutral study Bible that can be recommended and used by any denomination very few rise to the level of this one.

From pizza, to watermelon, to bread and anything else he finds, nothing is safe. A fun story with well-done illustrations, it is sure to be popular with all children. One of the things that make this title unique is the way the author ends the page with a partial sentence purposely designed to mislead the reader until they turn the page and read the rest of the sentence. For example one page ends with, &quot;Bullfrog was surrounded. He began to shake...&quot; The following page begins with &quot;... the tree. Down fell the apples.&quot; This anticipation and leading off onto the wrong track makes the book even more fun to read. &quot;Bullfrog Pops!&quot; is a highly recommended children's book.	2004-08-04

Instead of giving you a reference that you have to go flipping through your Bible to find and read, this Bible gives the entire text of any verses cross-referenced.  You know right away if the verse is relevant to your current study and save tremendous time by not constantly looking up verse after verse.  The Bible uses the New Living Translation (1996) and includes a basic concordance in the back along with a few maps.  With a two-column format at the top of the page for the primary text and three-column layout for the referenced verses at the bottom of the page, the additional information of the complete verses does not clutter the page at all.  The Bible still has a clean and easy to read format.  The Full Verse Cross Reference Bible is highly recommended for anyone who is tired of constantly breaking up the flow of their study by continuously searching out cross references.	2004-08-04

What makes this book particularly interesting is the social, cultural, and psychological analysis given for each type of joke, rhyme, etc.  If it is a gross rhyme the author notes when these became the most popular, the age groups it is most popular with and why.  If it is a nonsense joke like elephant jokes then he notes when they were most popular and how they could have represented society changing to deal with civil rights.  The book also includes various counting rhymes, games, toys, and other activities that are part of a child's world.  For a nostalgic trip back to the days of childhood or a serious study of childhood social structures American Children's Folklore is a recommended read.	2004-08-04

The writers of the Bible often used figures of speech that were common during their time. In fact we often use figures of speech in our everyday conversations without paying much attention to it but we do expect others to understand that we were speaking figuratively and not literally. For example, if we were to say someone is &quot;big as a barn&quot; we would not expect anyone to seriously think they were forty feet long, eighteen feet tall and twenty feet wide. By taking such figures of speech literally it is easy to be lead astray into false doctrines.<br /><br /> The other thing the book is particularly valuable for is literary analysis. The beauty of literature sometimes is its use of various literary devices. Introverted parallelism is an example of a literary device included in the book. This is where two or more items are listed in one order and then in the reverse order. For example Exodus 9:31 where it reads &quot;And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.&quot; First the order is flax and then barley and then the order changes to barley and then flax. Of course there are a lot of other literary devices such as acrostics, sentences that start or end with the same words, a chapter where each verse starts with the next letter of the Hebrew alphabet, or Psalms 69 where there are 22 groups of eight verses where each of the eight verses in that group all start with the same letter.<br /><br /> Whether it is examining these details of the Bible as literature or preventing an exegetic mistake by not understanding a figure of speech, &quot;Figures of Speech Used in the Bible&quot; is highly recommended and should be owned by all Bible students.	2004-07-20

It covers every topic you need to know to successfully create a secure and efficient Windows server (or at least as secure and efficient as a Windows server can be). The author does assume some basic knowledge of networking and so leaves out a lot of the basics, which is entirely appropriate in a book of this nature. The focus is on the Windows Server 2003 operating system and not on things like using IP addresses to subnet a network.<br /><br /> One of the things that differentiates this book from similar ones is that it is not an attempt to provide the reader with the information to pass some Microsoft exam, but focuses on what an administrator really needs to know to do their job. It is a practical and useful book, not one that will be shelved and not used again after taking some exam.<br /><br /> For such a thorough and practical book that attempts to provide real world knowledge I was surprised that it only has two pages about migrating up to a Windows Server 2003 system. Basically the only thing it mentions about upgrading is to make sure your hardware is on the approved hardware list. Although it is possible that this is the only potential problem in an upgrade experience has taught me that it is highly unlikely. I have never had an operating system version upgrade without some type of surprise. The only other thing that I don't like is the skimpy index given a book of this size. For each chapter there are items that should be in the index but are not.<br /><br /> Other than that, the book is well organized with each chapter containing all the information relevant to s specific task. The advantage here is that you don't have to go searching through five or six different places in the book to gather all the related information to do something - it is all in the appropriate chapter. Again, the focus is on usability and information for real world network operations instead of an exam. Each chapter follows the same basic outline of planning, implementing, and maintaining the chosen topic.<br /><br /> With just short of a thousand pages, &quot;Best Damn Windows Server 2003 Book Period&quot; is a highly recommended book for the person already familiar with computer networking who wants to learn the intricacies of Windows Server 2003. Don't buy it if you want a book to pass an exam, buy it because it will make your job easier, make your system perform the way you want, and provide a useful real-world resource if you have a problem.y and information for real world network operations instead of an exam.

Each service has a text for the sermon, scripture reading, introductory information, outline with important points detailed, and a conclusion.  The Sunday morning services information also includes appropriate hymn selections and an offertory prayer.  At the end of the book are several services for other activities where a minister officiates.  For example, there are messages on the Lord's Supper, messages for children, funerals, and weddings.  Although designed for the pastor this book should not be considered only for that role.  Youth ministers and camp counselors would find it very useful for beach services or camp services.  Those away from their church traveling or on missions would find it useful as a way to receive a daily message for meditation and strength.  Besides being for the pastor it gives you a way to take a pastor with you.  I find it useful for services when camping or otherwise in the wilderness either by myself or with a group.  The &quot;Zondervan 2005 Pastor's Annual&quot; is highly recommended for pastors, youth leaders, any anyone else who may want or need access to a full year's worth of sermon ideas.	2004-07-20

With everything contained in this one database it also becomes critical that it always be in good health.<br /><br /> &quot;Novell's Guide to Troubleshooting eDirectory&quot; is the definitive guide to fixing and maintaining the eDirectory. The book does assume the reader knows the basics of eDirectory and so does not cover things like installation, adding users, setting up printing, etc. It is not a book about setting up eDirectory but about troubleshooting and maintaining it.<br /><br /> The authors delved deep into the eDirectory structure and syntax as they explain exactly how it works, LDAP extensions supported, as well as the error codes and what they mean. They also detail how to understand the results from the diagnosing and repairing tools that come with Novell such as DSRepair, DSTrace, DSBrowse, and iMonitor. With complete information on objects, classes, and attributes this is an exhaustive volume for a through understanding of the eDirectory.<br /><br /> &quot;Novell's Guide to Troubleshooting eDirectory&quot; should be on the bookshelf of every Novell administrator or anyone who wants to program, read, or otherwise access the eDirectory in a direct manner. For the power users of the eDirectory this should be considered a required reference to be kept close at hand.	2004-07-20

In &quot;The Secret Sales Pitch&quot; author August Bullock presents a strong case not only for the existence of subliminal influences in marketing but also for their effectiveness. Some of the examples in the book are very obvious once they are pointed out and there is no question that they exist, others seem to be a bit of a stretch. Prepare to be both surprised and at times appalled at the things advertisers put in their marketing pieces.<br /><br /> It is important to point out that some of the subliminal examples could also be an accident of light and photography. As an avid photographer myself I have had some photos end up with what would appear to be subliminal messages and images entirely by accident. Some of them were less of a stretch than some of the examples in this book. This is not to say that his examples are not created on purpose as part of a subliminal plan. Many of them are unquestionable created for this purpose. There is also no question that psychology plays a very important role in advertising. One thing that differentiates this book form similar ones is that Mr. Bullock not only examines the subliminal items hidden in the picture but also explains the psychology behind other parts of the advertising piece. &quot;The Secret Sales Pitch&quot; is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in marketing and the use of subliminal messages in advertising.	2004-07-20

If it is written for the novice then it is too basic for the professional. If it is written for the professional then it is too technical for the novice. &quot;Beginning PHP 5 and MySQL: From Novice to Professional&quot; is one of the very few books that lives up to its claim.<br /><br /> It is written in a highly readable style and organized in such a way that the professional can easily skip over the basic stuff and get right to what they need. Yet the novice can work through the book and soon become quite proficient. Areas covered in the PHP section of the book include installing and configuring PHP5, using variables, flow control, arrays, advanced OOP, error handling, expressions, forms, authentication, networking, and LDAP. Areas covered in the MySQL section include installation and configuration, table structures, and database queries.<br /><br /> For such a large book it contains almost no filler information. Every page contains useful information, the examples are appropriate and detailed, and descriptions are clear and useful. Author W. Jason Gilmore has a rare and wonderful talent for taking the complex and describing it in a simple, easy to understand manner so that anyone at any level can understand how to do it.<br /><br /> &quot;Beginning PHP 5 and MySQL: From Novice to Professional&quot; is a book you will want to have if you currently work with PHP or plan to in the near future. It is not only highly recommended but is the best book I've seen on PHP and I will be clearing some space off my book shelf for it since it easily replaces three or four of my favorite ones. I will have to note that the section on MySQL does not cover that subject anywhere nearly as well as the book covers PHP. Buy the book, read it, and keep it for the PHP section. For MySQL try &quot;The Definitive Guide to MySQL, Second Edition&quot; also from Apress.uide to MySQL, Second Edition&quot; also from Apress.	2004-07-20

The lesson is simple - everyone gets angry at times and that is okay but it is what you do to deal with your anger that counts.  Throughout the book are illustrations of a puppy that asks questions designed to help the child openly communicate about their anger and appropriate ways of dealing with it.  I did have one concern about this book.  On page 17 it says, &quot;Do you do things that make your parents or teachers angry?  What do you do when someone is angry at you for something you've done wrong?&quot;  Children need to understand that if they do something wrong someone may become angry.  On the other hand sometimes people become angry even when the child has done nothing wrong.  While we can't really make anyone else angry (it's their emotion and not ours) anymore than we can force them to be happy, there often exists a cause and effect relationship that children need to be aware of.  This is a great opportunity to help a child learn two very important truths.  First is that you are not responsible for someone else's emotions, and second is that you are responsible for your actions and the results of those actions.

The lesson is simple - everyone gets angry at times and that is okay but it is what you do to deal with your anger that counts. Throughout the book are illustrations of a puppy that asks questions designed to help the child openly communicate about their anger and appropriate ways of dealing with it. I did have one concern about this book. On page 17 it says, &quot;Do you do things that make your parents or teachers angry? What do you do when someone is angry at you for something you've done wrong?&quot; Children need to understand that if they do something wrong someone may become angry. On the other hand sometimes people become angry even when the child has done nothing wrong. While we can't really make anyone else angry (it's their emotion and not ours) anymore than we can force them to be happy, there often exists a cause and effect relationship that children need to be aware of. This is a great opportunity to help a child learn two very important truths. First is that you are not responsible for someone else's emotions, and second is that you are responsible for your actions and the results of those actions. This is one of the books in the Emotional Literacy Series and can be purchased as part of a three books set on dealing with Bullying, Anger, and Fear.<br />Catherine Finds Her Courage<br />We all are afraid of things sometimes. &quot;Catherine Finds Her Courage&quot; is about dealing with fear and finding the courage to face it. It includes standard therapeutic techniques the child can use to overcome a more serious fear by conditioning it to have less and less of a negative emotional charge. Throughout the book a mouse illustration makes comments and asks questions designed to help the child talk openly about their fears. This is one of the books in the Emotional Literacy Series and can be purchased as part of a three books set on dealing with Bullying, Anger, and Fear.<br />Betty Stops the Bully<br />&quot;Betty Stops the Bully&quot; deals with ways people bully other people and what you can do about it. It also provides some insight for the child to determine if they are engaged in bullying or teasing someone else as well as a No More Bullies Pledge.

Was it intended to be an autobiographical account of her life?  Was it intended to be a motivational piece for young people?  Was it intended to be a historical account of social change?  Black youth might find it motivational while most white youth would have a hard time relating to it.  There are many other motivational and autobiographical books better suited for encouragement.<br />On the other hand this would be an excellent book for studying social change and the social environment over the past several decades in the black community.  Author Doris Marshall-Slack provides all the required details to get a complete depiction of growing up in the rural United States as a black person.  It follows the true story of the author as she rises from poverty in the days before the Civil Rights Movement, through a broken home and dysfunctional marriage and eventually to a master's degree.  This was all done while still trying to be a wife and mother.<br />This well-written and articulate book provides an even-handed and personal look into the life of the author.  It is an excellent study of the social-economic period and the struggles of black females over the past several decades.  A moving story, &quot;Perseverance Lane&quot; is recommended for general reading and anyone studying this period for social sciences, history, or black history.	2004-07-15

Each one can put us onto an emotional rollercoaster whether it is the loss of a loved one, a job, a friendship, or a multitude of other possibilities.  In &quot;Grief Steps&quot; author Brook Noel discusses the ten normal steps for working through grief.  For some people one step may be so short that it is unnoticed as they pass through, others may spend a great deal of time in that particular place.  We are all different and while we handle grief differently in many respects we also go through it in similar stages.  This book is about those stages and moving through the progression to healing.<br />Each of the grief steps has its own chapter, with extensive information on what to expect in that particular step.  For each stage there are also exercises, activities, or goals to help you work through that step and on to the next stage of healing.<br />&quot;Grief Steps: 10 Steps to Regroup, Rebuild and Renew After Any Loss&quot; is a strong treatment of grief associated with any type of loss and is well done.  However, if your loss were the loss of a person very close to you I would recommend her other book, &quot;I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye&quot;.  That is not to say that this book would not be valuable if you lost a loved one, just that the other one is better for that particular type of loss.  On the other hand, if you are experiencing loss and grief due to the loss of a job, empty nest syndrome, divorce, or similar situations then this book may be your better bet.  &quot;Grief Steps&quot; is well done and highly recommended.	2004-07-15

Reclaim Your Life	Books	5	7	7	N	N	One of the best	This is one of the more exciting books of this genre I have read.  If life seems to keep throwing you setback after setback and you are having trouble keeping your life together you will find this book a great help.  Author Cheryl Perlitz uses a very clear and simple writing style to present ways to deal with the obstacles of life and put your life back on track.  While there are many tips and techniques included in the book, they are organized into three basic sections that also reflect the pathway to reclaiming your contentment.  If you are already at the end of your rope first you have to learn to survive, then learn to revive yourself, and finally learn how to thrive in spite of setbacks.<br />This is an enlightening book with a realistic plan and viable techniques.  Encouraging, enlightening, and life-changing, &quot;Soaring Through Setbacks&quot; is a real find among the ubiquitous self-help books and very highly recommended.	2004-07-15

In &quot;Winning Habits&quot; author Dick Lyles has done an excellent job of doing exactly that.  A whole philosophy of life is distilled down into just four sentences which, when they become habits, will propel you forward in life no matter what your goals.<br />The book doesn't read like a typical self-help book but like a fictional work.  The reader sees life through the eyes of Albert and Jennifer as she gets regular promotions at work and he is left wondering why he does not.  Albert works hard and does his job well but he keeps getting passed over for promotions.  His emotional despair over the situation leads him on a search for answers.  The end result is a journey into discovering how to be a success at anything you want in life.  Through the storyline Mr. Lyles clearly shows the reader not only the secrets to success but also exactly how to use them to change your life.  No complex philosophy or convoluted ideas here, just plain simple truths of life.  &quot;Winning Habits: 4 Secrets that Will Change the Rest of Your Life&quot; is a highly recommended read.	2004-07-15

In this case both authors hold highly regarded credentials.  Richard Brown, M.D. is associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City and has a private practice in psychiatry and psychopharmacology.  Patricia Gerbarg, M.D. is assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College in Valhalla.<br />&quot;The Rhodiola Revolution&quot; is the result of their research and experiences with the herb Rhodiola Rosea.  Divided into three parts, the first part is mainly an introduction to the interrelated health factors of stress (both emotional and biological).  In it the authors also examine the human energy crisis in detail and how so many factors work together to rob people of their energy.<br />The second part provides a detailed history of Rhodiola Rosea and how it works to increase energy levels, safeguard the neurological system, regulate hormone balance, increase physical performance, reduce mental stress, help depression and a whole host of other problems.  What makes Rhodiola different from other herbs?  The authors point out that it is an adaptogen and very few herbs meet the qualifications to be classified as one.  Specifically an adaptogen must meet three qualifications.  First it must increase &quot;the body's resistance to a broad range of agents including physical (heat, cold, and exertion), chemical (toxins and heavy metals), and biological (bacteria and viruses)&quot;.  Second, it must have a normalizing action.  It must have a tendency to normalize &quot;whatever pathological changes or reactions have occurred&quot;.  So, if your thyroid is overactive it would tend to make it become less so and if it is under active it would tend to make it become more active.  No matter what the condition it tends to bring your variance back toward the norm.  Third, any side effects must be minimal or non-existent and it must have minimal toxicity.<br />The last part of the book is an action plan to increase your energy levels and maintain high energy levels for life.  It includes information on dietary changes, supplementation, sleep, exercise, and even mental aerobics.<br />&quot;The Rhodiola Revolution&quot; is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in alternative medicine and herbal solutions in particular.  The text was convincing enough that I decided to try supplementing with it.  A week later I find that I am much less fatigued at the end of the day and very happy with the results.

In it he enumerates the eleven qualities shared by students who love to learn and how these same qualities in a teacher make learning an adventure.  Each of the eleven qualities gets its own chapter where he details not only what defines that quality but provides examples of how to use it to teach children.  The eleven qualities are enthusiasm, adventure, creativity, reflection, balance, compassion, confidence, humor, common sense, appreciation, and resilience.  This is a highly recommended read and should be read by anyone interested in teaching children whether it is in the regular school system, home schooling, church school, leading children, camp counselors, or any other similar venue.	2004-07-15

The author literally starts at the very beginning by discussing what a web server is and the basics of how one works.  From there he examines the history of the Apache web server and how it compares to Microsoft IIS as well as which operating system might be the best one for you.  Each server operating system has its pros and cons when used as an Apache server and each benefit and shortcoming is listed.<br />Installation of the Apache server is also covered from the very beginning with how to get the source code.  After installing the program the author turns to configuring the server, setting up your domain, and setting up users.  He even covers setting up virtual hosting so you can host multiple web sites on one IP address.<br />On the positive side the book covers all the essentials for basic setup and configuration of an Apache server including information on setting up Perl, PHP, and Server Side Includes.  On the negative side it leaves out a lot of detail on the configuration files and other items.  If you need to do anything different or unusual you will need another book.  &quot;Apache Essentials&quot; is a recommended book if you need a good overview that has all the basic information to get Apache up and running quickly with a standard configuration.	2004-07-15

In 36 short essays Dale Alderman points out the funny side of fatherhood from playing, to potty training, to disciple, money, vacations, and every other fun and funny adventure of raising children.  With a great writing style that gets to the point quickly and brings a smile to the face, &quot;Being a Dad: The Stuff No One Told Me&quot; is very well done and highly recommended.	2004-07-15

There are also many technical books available on setting up a web server or other specific areas of Linux.  This book fills a very broad gap for the non-technical person who wants to know about open source products and how they can be beneficial to your needs.  This is not a technical manual but a guide that gives a higher-level view of what the software can do and how to use it.<br />It includes information on obtaining and installing Mandrake Linux (but no troubleshooting if you have a problem), setting up an office network, setting up an email server, setting up a web server, customer relationship management, calendar and schedule management, document management, accounting, project management, security, and just about everything you need to know to setup and run your business on an open source solution.<br />Perhaps the best way to provide an indication of this book's perspective is to look at a specific chapter.  One of the best ones for this purpose is the one on setting up a web server.  The first thing addressed is why you need a web server in the first place.  This is followed by an examination of the most common open source web server - Apache.  It then provides enough information to understand some of the basics of configuration.  This allows you to understand what the configuration files do and get a server up and running, but not enough information to actually configure a secure server.<br />So, what makes this book so unique that I would recommend it to anyone?  It meets the needs of the manager in that it is general enough that someone who has no knowledge of Linux can understand what is going on and what to expect of an installation.  Yet it also meets the needs of the technical Linux user who understands the details of all the configuration files but often does not have an overall view of what the complete system is supposed to do.  For example, it gives a short conceptual view of Perl that is sufficient to let the reader know if it is something that they could use but provides no information on how to program it.  Then again, there are many, many books on Perl programming available.<br />&quot;Open Source Solutions for Small Business Problems&quot; is a very highly recommended book for anyone who is looking at the open source market and particularly anyone considering Linux as an operating system of choice either on the desktop or as a server.  This is easily one of the best Linux books of the year; providing a management level view of the Linux world without the technical focus of other books.ives a short conceptual view of Perl that is sufficient to let the reader know if it is something that they could use but provides no information on how to program it.

Authors Andrew Goldstein, M.D. and Marianne Brandon, Ph.D., the founders of the Sexual Wellness Center in Annapolis, Maryland, claim that there are four keys to reclaiming this desire.  These keys are good physical health, being emotional resilient, being intellectually fulfilled, and having spiritual contentment.<br />We all go through various life changes, any one of which can affect the libido.  The authors look at many of these changes and how they affect your sex drive as well as what can be done to reduce or eliminate that effect.  Each of their four keys is examined in detail including not only how things like hormones, depression, anxiety, stress, menopause and other factors affect your drive but also exploring how to lessen those effects.  They do a good job of exposing various myths and misconceptions as well as detailing what works and what does not.  With today's focus on natural health options they even include information on how exercise and other natural options can be used.<br />Throughout the book two messages are clear - you are not alone and there is hope.  &quot;Reclaiming Desire&quot; is highly recommended to any woman suffering from a declining libido who wants to reclaim that portion of their relationship as part of their life.	2004-07-15

This is an extensive examination of the Snort program and includes Snort 2.1 on CD with the Book.<br />The authors start with defining what an intrusion detection system is, what it is not, and how placing it in your network at different points achieves different goals.  This is followed by an introduction to Snort and a description of its capabilities and functions before getting into the nuts and bolts of installing and configuring it.<br />One of the more difficult parts of Snort to understand is how to write the rules that determine when an intrusion has occurred.  The authors do an excellent job of describing exactly how to write good rules to achieve the results you want.  They even include an excellent section on how to deal with all that information you will be collecting.<br />&quot;Snort 2.1 Intrusion Detection, Second Edition&quot; is highly recommended for anyone who wants a good, useful explanation of how an intrusion detection system should work and how to implement Snort to achieve that result.	2004-07-15

Author John Biggs takes the reader on a mind-expanding journey into these areas where questionable characters are more the rule than the exception.  Along the way you will learn about port scanning, viruses, spam, spyware, worms, scams, pirates, and hacking.  This is one of the very few books that teach the reader what can happen and how to be prepared without becoming a book that teaches malcontents how to become a hacker.  This makes it one of the very few books that I could recommend to high schools, youth groups, and adult groups who want to understand the dangers of the Internet.<br />&quot;Black Hat&quot; is a book that is long overdue for publication.  Most books on this subject are too technical for the average reader; this one is the exception.  Everyone who surfs the net, for whatever reason, should read a book like this just so they know what can happen.  If you are a non-technical user then &quot;Black Hat: Misfits, Criminals, and Scammers in the Internet Age&quot; is the best book available today for this purpose.  This book should be considered as a gift for friends and family you love that surf the net and need to be safe.	2004-06-29

I could not have been more wrong.  I soon realized that although I have used Google regularly for several years I know very little about how to use it efficiently to get the results I want.  But that situation has changed thanks to this book.  If you have an Internet connection and you do anything with Google you should get a copy of this book.  When you are done reading it you will have a new respect for Google and how it can make your life easier is so many ways, including a lot of different uses besides as an Internet search engine.  There is even some humor in the book, like changing the language to Elmer Fudd for some humorous spellings.  &quot;Google: The Missing Manual&quot; is highly recommended and truly the missing manual.	2004-06-29

At this level most computer sciences classes tend to focus on programming and programming theory.  While it does have some programming examples (all in Java), this book takes a more overall view and deals with the basics of algorithms and data structures.  Why is this an important difference?  I have seen a lot of bloated code over the years where a programmer writes a hundred or more lines of code to do something that a couple of lines could do if they only had a better understanding of algorithms.  This course gives you the conceptual knowledge you need to be able to adapt to other computer languages and coding techniques as they are developed.<br />The book does make some assumptions about the reader.  First, it assumes the reader has had an introductory course in an object-oriented programming language.  As indicated earlier, all examples are in Java, but you should be able to follow along if you have had a course in any object-oriented language.  Second, the book also assumes a good (but not necessarily college level) background in mathematics.<br />This is a foundational course in the design of algorithms, and data structures and mathematical theory to predict and verify, as well as empirical analysis to test the results.  &quot;Algorithms and Data Structures: The Science of Computing&quot; is a recommended book as a second course in a computer sciences degree as well as a foundational course for those who are trying to develop a broad basis of computer knowledge at home.	2004-06-29

This book is about hacks the way it is used in the world of photography and not the way it is used in the world of computers.  When a picture doesn't come out quite like a photographer intended they often make changes in the darkroom via masks, burning, and other techniques.  This is photographic &quot;hacking&quot; - enhancing and changing your digital photographs in ways you may not have thought possible to achieve the results you want.<br />The first chapter focuses on digital camera attachments and how to use them to produce better results.  From there the author leads the reader into various techniques of outside photography, nighttime photography, and flash techniques.  Once you understand how to get the best picture it is time to change it into a work of art.  For this process the author discusses the magic of Photoshop and how it can be used to achieve almost any effect you can imagine.<br />This is a book for the amateur digital camera user who wants to create a professional looking result.  If you are an advanced Photoshop user the part of the book about camera use could be helpful but the Photoshop portion doesn't cover even a tenth of what Photoshop is able to do.<br />&quot;Digital Photography Hacks&quot; is highly recommended for the amateur digital photographer and anyone else interested in creating photographs instead of taking pictures.	2004-06-29

However, when the purpose of your computer is to allow access to your webpages by anyone on the Internet security needs to be a primary concern.  If you are serious about hardening your Apache server you will want to have this book.<br />Author Tony Mobily examines Apache security in detail all the way from making sure the initial installation package has not been hacked at the primary web server site through configuration and installation of security modules.  The book has seven chapters that cover configuration, common attacks, logging, scripting attacks, security modules, using a jail, and automating security with scripts.<br />While the book does cover Apache on the various operating systems the focus is on a Linux install, which is appropriate since that is the most common place to install Apache.  This is not a book that I would suggest for someone who is totally new to Apache or Linux, but if you have a passing familiarity with them then you will find this to be the missing information from other Apache books.  No matter which Apache book you get to learn Apache, your library will be incomplete if it doesn't include &quot;Hardening Apache&quot;.	2004-06-29

Incorporation instructions include details such as minimum shareholders, S-Corporations election (and why you might want to do elect it), minimum capitalization requirements, tax effects, and just about everything else you might need to know.  It doesn't matter what state you live in or what state you want to incorporate in, information is provided for every state.<br />Forms to be used for standard business transactions are also included in the book.  For example, there are forms for board meetings, shareholder meetings, authorizing contracts, authorizing the sale of real estate, authorizing the borrowing of money, appointing a lawyer, appointing an accountant, authorizing stock transfers, and pretty much every other situation where you might need a form you will find the fill-in-the-blank document here.<br />In addition to the book, all the forms are also included on the CDROM so you can print them out easily or fill them in right on your computer.  Every form that you can think of for just about any situation is included in this book and on the CDROM.  It is easily the most extensive set of forms of any similar book I have seen.

It does provide some background and comparison of different forms of business but it is somewhat cursory and leaves out many important details.  (For example, if an S-Corporation pays for life insurance or health insurance for an officer it does not get to deduct those costs from their tax return.  But if a C-Corporation pays those expenses it does get to deduct them from its tax return.)  Then again, it makes no claim that it provides a full analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of a corporation.  In fact the author states &quot;The decision of which business entity to choose depends upon many factors and should be carefully studied.  If the choice is to operate a business as a corporation or S-corporation, this book will provide an array of easy-to-use legal forms which will, in most cases, allow the business owner to start and operate the corporation with minimal difficulty while meeting all of the legal paperwork requirements.&quot;  Since such an analysis is intentionally not a part of the book it should not be considered a shortcoming.

He can't do anything quietly.  When he is frustrated he yells, when he is confused he yells, when he is angry he yells, when he wants something he yells.  Yelly Kelly just yells about pretty much anything.  Finally the time comes to teach him that he should not yell all the time about things that are unimportant.  In a tale reminiscent of the &quot;boy who cried wolf&quot; he soon learns that there is a price to be paid for yelling all the time for no reason.<br />This is a well-done bilingual book written in English and Spanish for children about four to eight years old.  &quot;Yelly Kelly&quot; is a recommended children's book.	2004-06-24

I was glad to be proven wrong with this delightful book.  The desserts are still calorie packed with most of them still having 300+ calories per serving.  However, this is still typically about a third less calories than the same dessert prepared using a traditional recipe.  Each one of the desserts has significantly less fat (often one third or less), has almost completely eliminated the cholesterol, and has added nutrients and minerals.  I have always equated less fat with less taste simply because that has been my experience, now I can say that less fat can still mean delicious.<br />Some of the recipes that I really liked included Amaretto Cheesecake Brownies, Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch Bars, Hazelnut Fudge Cake, Cream Cheese Pound Cake, Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie, and Maple Nut Fudge.  If you are looking for a better alternative to satisfy your sweet tooth or just a healthier dessert you can't go wrong with this book.  &quot;Power Desserts&quot; is a highly recommended purchase for anyone looking to better their health and still satisfy their sweet tooth.	2004-06-24

In his book &quot;Winning the Hepatitis C Battle&quot; author Shekhar Challa, M.D. provides a comprehensive, authoritative overview of the disease.  Dr. Challa discusses the diagnosis of the disease, treatment options, potential complications, and even herbs and other alternative treatments.<br />One of the things that make this book unique is the inclusion of the emotional aspects of being diagnosed with Hepatitis C and going through treatment.  Dr. Challa includes many of the personal thoughts and comments of Denise Hudman from the point where she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C through some of her feelings as she went through treatment.  This is invaluable insight if you are dealing with a friend who has been diagnosed with the disease.<br />&quot;Winning the Hepatitis C Battle&quot; also includes a frequently asked questions section and a glossary.  With the comprehensive coverage and easy to understand writing style this is a highly recommended read for anyone wanting to gain a broad understanding of Hepatitis C.	2004-06-24

The purpose of the book is to try to help the grieving move through such a loss and start regaining their life.  It is also a great reference for those who know someone going through such grief and want to understand it better so they can help.<br />The book focuses on the problems faced by the bereaved.  I appreciate the fact that the authors recognize that everyone has a different way of expressing grief.  Some get angry, some depressed, some reach to religion, some back away from it.  And even within these broad categories there are many, many differences in religious tradition and cultural differences.  But even through all of these differences there are some feelings that everyone shares.  For example, everyone obviously feels a sense of loss and desolation.  Everyone also has to learn to deal with who they are, now that part of them is gone and part of the future they planned together will never come to pass.  The authors also point out that there will be days that are much worse than others.  For example, two of the worst days that may carry on for years before getting better are the anniversary of the loss and the child's birthday.  Of course there are also differences depending on how old the child was when it died.  As a result, the authors have included sections on the stillborn, infant/toddler, younger child, adolescent, and adult child.<br />&quot;Facing the Ultimate Loss&quot; is required reading for anyone with a friend dealing with the death of a child.  For those experiencing the loss it would be most appropriate some time after the loss when they are seeking to start putting their life back together again.  Either way, it is a highly recommended read.	2004-06-24

Each page of the book has the text printed in both English and Spanish so it is easy to associate the English and Spanish words.  The illustrations are colorful and will easily hold the interest of a young reader.  The story line shows the strong friendship between Victor and Dominic.<br />I had a couple of other people take a look at the book and found that most people miss part of the surprise at the end of the book.  Victor has a disability which would cause most people to end the book with a comment that they like Victor just the way he is, but the author turns this philosophy on its head when Dominic says that the most important thing about Victor is that he accepts Dominic just the way he is.  What a wonderful conclusion and a great way to teach perspective.  &quot;My Pal Victor&quot; is a recommended read.	2004-06-24

Monkey wants to count his coconuts before eating them and wants a fast way to do it.  So, he starts counting each of them.  Then, one by one, other animals point out that it would be faster to count by twos, threes, fours, fives, or tens.  Of course as he puts them in piles of two or three or more each time he spends more time.  Before you know it he has spent all day trying to count the coconuts in faster ways.<br />The illustrations are bright, colorful, and appropriate to the text.  With the whimsical expressions on the animals they should hold the attention of young readers.  The storyline could be a good spring board for teaching that searching for the easiest or fastest way to do something can sometimes consume a lot more time than just doing it.  &quot;Counting Coconuts&quot; is a recommended read for young children of about five to eight years old.	2004-06-24

The first part of the book examines the table saw itself and the coverage is excellent.  Starting with an education on the various parts of the table saw it progresses through different types, blades, and functions.  Next comes a thorough section on table saw maintenance and how to select a used table saw.  The analysis of what to look for and how to determine the condition of a used saw is very detailed and well illustrated.<br />The next section covers basic cuts, joinery techniques, sawing accessories and basic jigs.  One of the things that I really liked about the book is the detailed information on making your own jigs.  Making the cuts to create a specific joining method is fine but it can be a pain to do several of them in a row by hand.  So, he not only teaches how to make the cuts to make the join but also teaches how to make a jig so that it can be used to make the cuts quicker and easier.  This shows that the author not only knows his joining techniques but also has the real life knowledge of how professional woodworkers actually do it.  The last section of the book contains several projects you can make using your table saw.  These projects include various cabinets, a play table and chairs, and an entertainment center.<br />&quot;The Complete Table Saw Book&quot; is an excellent reference that I can highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn about table saws and how to use them for everything from basic cutting to cabinetry.  Filled with illustrations so you can easily understand everything in it, you can't go wrong with this book.	2004-06-24

Although not always perfect, it has a strong-metered rhyming style that is easy to read and fall into the rhythmic beat of the story.  A new Snoodle is born in Snoodleburg but he can't find his place in the world.  It seems he is not particularly good at anything and everyone is making fun of him.  He eventually learns the truth about life and how important he is.  Where other books struggle to make a point about everyone being important and having their place in life, &quot;A Snoodle's Tale&quot; makes the point easily and gracefully.

More and more new MTA servers are moving to a modular program like qmail that has a multitude of smaller programs for each function instead of one huge program that does everything.  This allows for greater speed and flexibility.  John R. Levine's new book &quot;qmail: Managing Unix-Based Mail Systems&quot; examines the qmail program in depth from installation to configuration to troubleshooting.  While qmail is fairly straightforward and you can achieve great results on both small and very large systems, it is a very different way of thinking if you are moving from sendmail and are already familiar with it.  The author recognizes this difficulty of changing the way you think and spends a good portion of the beginning of the book detailing qmail and how it works so you understand the &quot;qmail frame of mind&quot;.  I've never setup a sendmail server and so I did not have the obstacle to overcome but I have setup and configured the postfix MTA which is also a modular type program.  With that background the book was a breeze to follow along and I was even able to download a copy and configure it correctly for my system.  The coverage was excellent and the installation and configuration information provided all the information I needed to get it up and running.  If you are thinking of building a qmail MTA you will find &quot;qmail: Managing Unix-Based Mail Systems&quot; absolutely indispensable and the only reference you need to get it done right the first time.	2004-06-17

Author John Kay, a prominent British economist, postulates that one of the reasons is due to cultural factors.  These cultural norms may both free and confine the society when it comes to prosperity.  If international trade benefits both rich and poor countries then why do poor countries remain poor?  In a brilliant exposition of economics he argues that it is not the free markets and constant search for materialistic acquisition that has made America prosperous but it is largely a factor of the various institutions we have in place.  That is one reason why many countries have been unsuccessful in trying to emulate the American economic machine.  If our success were based entirely on free markets then bringing them to other countries would allow them to prosper, but they often do not.  If you were taught the traditional Adam Smith and Keynesian economic models you will be delighted with this additional perspective on the international market and why our models often don't work in other countries.  By the same token the models that work in their cultures may not work at all in ours.  A fascinating read and a fresh view of international economics, &quot;Culture and Prosperity&quot; is a highly recommended book.	2004-06-17

If not then are we headed for one?  Why have such major economic figures as Alan Greenspan started hinting that deflation is a possibility?  Is deflation always a negative event bringing on recession is its wake?  Author and financial columnist Chris Farrell answers all these questions and more in his fascinating book &quot;Deflation: What Happens When Prices Fall&quot;.  Mr. Farrell makes a strong case for deflationary pressures coming about from globalization of many industries as well as the strong pressure from retailers forcing suppliers to continually lower their prices.  While deflation is a normal part of the economic cycle most of the 20th century has seen pronounced inflation.  What does it all mean now that there are legitimate concerns about deflation?  Mr. Farrell makes a convincing case that deflation does not necessarily equate with depression.  In fact deflation can co-exist with a strong economy!  This is definitely not the economics that I learned in college but is a well presented argument for a different view of where we are headed.  Brilliantly done, &quot;Deflation: What Happens When Prices Fall&quot; is highly recommended for anyone interested in economic theory and may represent a more accurate view of deflation than the popular Keynesian theory of economics.	2004-06-17

Starting from the most basic setup of homemade components to purchase and use of commercial ones it is one of the most thorough books available today on the subject.  The authors wisely start out the book with defining what WarDriving is and what it is not.  They define WarDriving as moving around a specific area and mapping the wireless access points for statistical purposes.  It does not include actually accessing these points without prior permission.  As such, the purpose of WarDriving is to raise awareness of the security issues related to wireless networks.<br />The first section of the book covers setting up both a laptop and a PDA for WarDriving purposes.  This includes important general concepts like antenna types and their advantages and disadvantages, and connecting antenna to a wireless NIC.  It also includes very specific information like specific NIC cards that work well and are conducive to the connection of external antennas and the like.<br />Once your hardware is set up you have to turn your attention to appropriate software.  The authors detail both Windows and Linux software (free and commercial products) available to discover access points.  It includes how to use NetStumbler, MiniStumbler, and Kismet to locate wireless LANs, the various options, and how to interpret the results.  These are very detailed chapters and explain both the concepts and actual product use very well.  Each of these chapters ends with additional software available to actually map the access points.<br />The final section of the book covers the details of attacking wireless networks.  It includes information on finding cloaked points, hijacking, man-in-the-middle attacks, defeating MAC address filtering, and even attacking encrypted networks.  In addition they include the details of enabling security on several specific models of Linksys and D-Link access points.  The last part of the book covers advanced security information including configuring WiFi Protected Access, Wireless Gateway, VPN setup, RADIUS, and LEAP.<br />This is clearly one of the best books available on the subject of WarDriving.  It provides a thorough examination of the subject, detailed explanations and instructions, and pretty much everything you need to know in this area.  &quot;WarDriving, Drive, Detect, Defend&quot; is a very highly recommended book for anyone interested in wardriving.t part of the book covers advanced security information including configuring WiFi Protected Access, Wireless Gateway, VPN setup, RADIUS, and LEAP.<br />This is clearly one of the best books available on the subject of WarDriving.

Author Kevin Griffin answers this question succinctly when he points out that the Buddha said the cause of suffering is desire and the twelve steps program tries to heal people from the most extreme of desires - addiction.<br />This book is about Mr. Griffin's personal path to addiction recovery and how integrating Buddhism and the twelve steps allowed him to become at peace with himself.  He explains Buddhist meditation and the Buddhist eight-fold path as it parallels the twelve step path.  While the twelve step program allows for a lot of flexibility in terms of the &quot;Higher Power&quot; you reach out to, many groups have a Christian focus.  Kevin Griffin provides an alternative for those who are uncomfortable with a Christian focus but want to overcome alcoholism and co-dependency.  &quot;One Breath at a Time&quot; is a deeply personal story of one man's journey and he invites you to travel his path from realization that he had a problem to freedom and shares how you can take the same path.	2004-06-08

This book stands out as a refreshing breath of fresh air in an area far too crowed by prejudiced and misleading books based more on fear than anything else.  Author Mateen Elass provides an understanding not only of the Koran but also of the Muslim faith in general.  She discusses history, traditions, and religious custom as well as the belief system itself.  If you are tired of the multitude of books that tell you what the Koran says when it is obvious the authors have obviously never read it themselves you will be delighted with this one with an author that obviously has an intimate knowledge of Muslim and Christian religious texts, practices, and beliefs.  &quot;Understanding the Koran&quot; is highly recommended to all readers and given the current state of inaccurate propaganda being spread from all quarters it is required reading for anyone who wants an accurate portrayal of the Koran.	2004-06-08

With wireless finally coming into its own over the last couple of years &quot;Linux Unwired&quot; is a very timely and useful book.  All the aspects of wireless in all of its current manifestations are covered including Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), Bluetooth, infrared, cellular networking, and global positioning system (GPS) devices.<br />Before getting into the details of getting Linux to work with wireless the authors provide a thorough understanding of radio waves and how they act, hardware, and antenna types.  Understanding these basic concepts is important if your system is to work the way you want.<br />One of the really nice features of the book is the information on picking the right card so you have the fewest problems getting things up and running.  The authors even name specific manufacturers and card models that work well with Linux and then they go through installing the driver and configuring the software to work with the device.  Along the same lines they provide information on Linux friendly access point providers and even building your own access point.<br />One you have your Linux system up and running on wireless there is a chapter on locating hotspots and using them to get onto the Internet.  This chapter really only covers the basics of locating hotspots.  If you are really interested in this area you might try another O'Reilly book just on this subject titled &quot;WarDriving, Drive, Detect, Defend&quot;.  Of course, if you are concerned about your wireless security (and you should be) it includes information on configuring Wired Equivalency Protocol (WEP) and Wireless Protected Access (WPA).<br />If you are anticipating moving your Linux system to a wireless interface you can't go wrong with &quot;Linux Unwired&quot;.  The authors do an excellent job of providing all the information you need to get it done right.  &quot;Linux Unwired&quot; is highly recommended for anyone interested in Linux wireless networks.d to get it done right.  &quot;Linux Unwired&quot; is highly recommended for anyone interested in Linux wireless networks.	2004-06-07

It assumes a good deal of basic knowledge about MySQL.  On the other hand, if you know the basics and need to get that extra knowledge to move your system from one that just works to one that truly performs then this book is for you.  From the initial steps of benchmarking your system and tweaking the indexes the book moves on to improving your performance through optimizing queries and server performance tuning.  This includes examining all aspects of your system from disk and file system selection to minor configuration changes that may make great changes in performance.  Once the server is working at its optimum for your needs the book turns to how to scale your SQL system up to multiple servers and configure replication, load balancing, and high availability systems.  The main text of the book ends with a section on backup, recovery, and security.  If you need performance, reliability and security beyond the standard configuration and need to maximize throughput this is the book you will want to have at hand.  &quot;High Performance MySQL&quot; is one of the best optimization and performance books available for the intermediate to advanced user of MySQL - very highly recommended.	2004-06-07

For anyone headed to Walt Disney World or who just wants to impress their friends by the depth of their knowledge, &quot;The Walt Disney World Trivia Book&quot; is a recommended read.  (By the way, you ride the Big Thunder Mountain railroad in the afternoon because the afternoon heat melts the grease and it runs faster and there are about 300,000 leaves in the Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse).	2004-06-07

These particular distributions are intended for the workstation market and so have many productivity related tools and fewer of the server tools.  I particularly appreciated that it does not assume the reader is a high level technician but starts with all the basics and theory behind Linux including things like hard disk organization, hard disk track, sectors, cylinders, etc.  Bill McCarthy does an excellent job of explaining what is going on.<br />The author walks you through the installation and configuration using the graphical interface (by far the only appropriate interface for the non-technical person trying to install Linux by their self).  This section includes configuring networking and user accounts, organizing data, the default directory tree, file permissions, and using the X system.  It also includes a good description of devices and how they are used in Linux, something you really need to understand to setup Linux correctly.<br />The two most common graphic user interfaces (GNOME and KDE) are examined in detail including common applications that come with Red Hat Enterprise and Fedora.  These applications include OpenOffice, Evolution - an email client and personal scheduler, a PDA tool, and a CD writer.<br />For the more serious administrator he discusses the Bash shell (the default command interpreter), installing new software using the RPM package manager, and network services like Samba (to share files with Windows systems), Apache (web server), Secure Shell (for secure connections), and firewall configuration.<br />The authors also include a complete copy of Fedora on CD so you can actually install the operating system and configure it while you learn.  &quot;Learning Red Hat Enterprise Linux &amp; Fedora&quot; is highly recommended for anyone looking to make Linux their desktop operating system.make Linux their desktop operating system.	2004-06-07

It takes a different approach to learning Linux than most other books.  Other books typically focus on a section of Linux and go over it in detail.  For example, it may cover the file system from selecting an appropriate one to how to mount disks, security, directories, links, and similar information until it has presented all the information on the file system.  Instead this one divides the learning task up into basic stuff you need to know, intermediate knowledge, and more advanced levels.  This is actually more consistent with the knowledge expected in the real world.  While I would expect even a basic administrator to understand how to mount and unmount a drive I would not necessarily expect them to know how to interpret and change an fstab configuration file.  To go over the whole file system from beginning to advanced levels leaving the student unknowledgeable in other basic tasks doesn't make as much senses.  I would rather hire someone who knows the basics of the system including adding users and other administration than one who knows everything about one area.  So, I really like the way it teaches basic knowledge in all areas, then intermediate knowledge in all areas, then advanced.<br />The focus is on the user or the person who has been assigned to administer an existing Linux system.  If you need to add a peripheral device, setup or change printing, mount a CD for access by Windows based machines, or pretty much anything else that an administrator of a Linux file server needs to know its covered.  There are better books for other type of servers like setting up a web server, MySQL, or other items.  However, if you are completely new to Linux or a fairly novice Linux user and need to be able to administer a file server type system you will enjoy this book.  Designed for the person who wants to really learn about Linux from the ground up &quot;How Linux Works&quot; is a recommended read.rks&quot; is a recommended read.	2004-06-07

If so have we become so confused that we are headed back to a time when reason is thrown away in favor of what can only be called superstitious belief?  Author Francis Wheen examines our world today and how cults, superstition, and the desire to want to believe have caused a veritable epidemic of foolishness often passing as science.  In his book &quot;Idiot Proof&quot; he takes on several people who are veritable icons of contemporary society - people like Nancy Reagan, Deepak Chopra, George Bush, Hillary Clinton, and many others.  In addition to people he takes on various subjects like UFOs, crystals, psychics, and astrology.  This is a book about how people are lead like sheep to the slaughter merrily bleating along the way totally unaware of their folly.  While you may not agree with all the assessments, they are logically founded and well argued.<br />While I enjoyed the book and Mr. Wheen's commentary, I don't personally agree with everything in the book.  Still, I recognize the importance of having people like Mr. Wheen occasionally point out the contrasting side of a belief.  The way we grow and refine our beliefs requires that we keep an open mind and examine all sides.  Mr. Wheen serves this purpose of presenting the opposing viewpoint very well.  Then again, if we have learned anything from history it is that science can lead us down the wrong path just as easily as any superstition.  There was a time when doctors lost their jobs and were subject to ridicule if they believed in germs.  The whole concept was nonsense and against logic and current knowledge.<br />With plenty of notes and cross-references at the end of the book, &quot;Idiot Proof&quot; is a recommended read and sure to be enlightening to everyone on at least a few fronts.	2004-06-07

According to author Doug Thorburn alcoholics alone are estimated to be between seven and fifteen percent of all adults.  If this isn't a big enough problem by itself each alcoholic also adversely affects three or four other people.  Because of their problem they often bring financial and emotional ruin not only to their self but also to the ones they love, and who love them, the most.  Recognizing this problem and intervening early is what the book &quot;Drunks, Drugs &amp; Debits&quot; is all about.<br />By far alcoholism is the predominant focus of the book but most of the information also applies to drug addicts.  The author does a good job of presenting the information from a neutral and factual perspective as he examines alcoholism, factors that tend to exacerbate it and why some people seem to be more prone to it than others.  One of the best chapters deals with recognizing the addict and why it is hard to identify them when you know them personally.<br />Of course, the debits part of the book is about how addiction often results in financial abuse of others; including friends, spouse, parents, partners, children.<br />Doug even includes a section on recovery for the non-addict who is trying to move forward in life and relationships.  &quot;Drunks, Drugs &amp; Debits&quot; is recommended if you have an addict in your life, think you may have one, or are one of the many people affected by one.	2004-06-06

Hardware is covered very well from the basics of identifying components to diagnosis and repair.  The authors even include information on websites with various freeware and shareware programs as well as commercial programs to help diagnose problems and test system equipment.<br />For operating system problems and maintenance they cover most of the versions of Windows (95, 98, ME, 2000, XP).  The only one not covered is NT, which is becoming more rare every day.  There is no coverage of Linux as a desktop operating system and that is consistent with the A+ Certification exam.<br />All chapters end with a set of typical certification style questions to help make sure you understood the most important points of the chapter.  Throughout the book the authors have included excellent photographs, illustrations, and tables with clear labels that make the material understandable and easy to learn.  Tutorial exercises are also scattered throughout so you can actually test what you have learned.  The book is divided into two distinct parts with Part I actually teaching you what you need to know and Part II organizing it for exam study purposes.  Lots of little tips are also scattered throughout the book and help bring years of experience to the reader.<br />In summary, not only does it prepare you well for the exam but also provides an excellent education in PC hardware and basic configuration and maintenance.  The included CD-ROM contains, among other things, several videos showing how to do things, and four practice exams.  &quot;The A+ Certification and PC Repair Handbook&quot; is highly recommended for anyone who wants a solid basic education in PC repair and maintenance or who is trying to pass the A+ certification.	2004-06-06

How big is the problem?  Based on a study in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for every 10 people cited for driving under the influence another 37 are missed.  According to the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration DWI Detection and Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Manual as many as five percent of drivers are intoxicated on any given weeknight and 10% on a weekend night.<br />How do you protect yourself with all these intoxicated drivers on the road?  The easiest way is to learn to identify them on the road early so you can choose not to be involved in their accident.  &quot;Get Out of the Way&quot; contains a lot of information on how to spot them early so you can keep get out of the way.  For example, did you know that according to a NHTSA study sixty percent of those who make obscene gestures at other drivers on the road are driving under the influence?  Fifty percent of tailgaters and sixty-five percent of those who make a wide radius turn are driving under the influence.  These are just a few of the extensive list of signs included in the book.<br /><br />With the information in this book you can easily teach your children and yourself how to keep safe on the road.  &quot;Get Out of the Way: How to Identify &amp; Avoid a Driver Under the Influence&quot; is highly recommended and should be required in every drivers education class.	2004-06-06

If you are not then you will probably find difficulty with many portions of the book.<br />One of the things that I really liked the way the author brings the reader up to speed about the history of the area between the Old and New Testament time periods.  He does an excellent job covering the rise of the Greek Period, through the Hasmonean Period, and up to the Roman Period, including the rule of the Ptolemies and Seleucids.<br />Throughout the book the author includes many photographs and illustrations to help the reader understand the text.  He also does a good job of recounting the various theories as to why the synoptic gospels often share not only common themes but also at some points nearly the same wording.  On the other hand he does not even mention the fact that there are other places where they disagree with each other.  This one-sided treatment is consistent throughout the book.<br />In addition, some of the pictures belong more in a tourist pamphlet than a serious Bible survey book.  (For example, there are pictures of places where the caption reads &quot;traditionally&quot;, &quot;probably&quot;, &quot;supposed&quot;, or &quot;believed&quot; to be a particular site.  For most of them there is no evidence of this being the actual location but even in the Middle Ages traders recognized the value of having a religiously significant location within your city.  So, many &quot;traditional&quot; sites suddenly sprang up.)  Fortunately these sorts of pictures are few in number when compared with the large number that enhances the text.<br />While mainstream or liberal readers will find little of any value in &quot;Survey of the New Testament&quot;, it is recommended for conservative Christian readers who will find it a valuable resource that enhances that belief system.	2004-05-26

If you are not then you will probably find difficulty with many portions of it.  However, you may still find value in the large number of photographs, charts, tables, and graphs.<br />The author does an excellent of distilling chapters of information into tables that clearly show the relationships.  For example, he has illustrations of the chronological relationship between the Old Testament books (no the Bible does not have them in chronological order), God's covenants with Israel, and a chronology of Israel's judges.  Hardly a page goes by without a picture, illustration, chart, or other visual aid to help the reader understand the author's comments.  However, some of the pictures belong more in a tourist pamphlet than a serious Bible survey book.  (For example, there are pictures of places &quot;tradition&quot; assigns as significant, like the &quot;burial place&quot; of Samuel.  There is no evidence of this being factual but even in the Middle Ages traders recognized the value of having a religiously significant location within your city.  So, many &quot;traditional&quot; sites suddenly sprang up.)  Fortunately these sorts of pictures are few in number when compared with the large number that enhances the text.<br />While the mainstream or more liberal Christian may find something of value in the charts and tables, &quot;Survey of the Old Testament&quot; is really recommended mainly for conservative Christian readers who will find it a valuable resource strongly slanted toward that belief system.	2004-05-26

Author Tiffany Snow takes the reader on a trip through science, healing, and religion and how these intersect to provide healing for the body and soul. Perhaps one of the most important points in the book is the clear delineation between spiritual healing and divine healing. Spiritual healing includes things related to energy including spiritual energy. Divine healing, on the other hand, is healing that includes prayer and an invocation to God to actively take a part in the process. We know that putting an antibiotic on an open wound helps keep it from becoming infected because we apply the laws of nature that God has put forth. We can use similar principles for spiritual or energy healing. But above using laws of nature for healing is the Divine healing that comes from God's active participation in the process. This places Tiffany Snow in an interesting philosophical position. For conservative Christians she will be too much New Age and for many New Age people who wish to take credit for all healing she will be too much Christian. Those in the middle will find her delightful.<br />I appreciate that she also has the wisdom to include the importance of forgiveness and emotional healing as part of the complete healing process. Elsewhere in the book she discusses how to pray, and some techniques that have worked for her. Near the end is a collection of inspirational healing scriptures, poems, and prayers.<br />Some may have a problem with the chapter on deliverance and exorcism. It is a curious anomaly that most people believe in angels but don't believe in demons. If that is the case with you then you will probably have difficulty with this chapter. But don't discount the whole book because of this, as there is a lot of good information available as well as encouragement for those who wish to understand divine healing and the importance of prayer in a person's life.<br />&quot;The Power of Divine: A Healer's Guide&quot; is a recommended read for anyone interested in the healing process and the importance of the Divine in the process.erstand divine healing and the importance of prayer in a person's life. <br />&quot;The Power of Divine: A Healer's Guide&quot; is a recommended read for anyone interested in the healing process and the importance of the Divine in the process.	2004-05-22

The authors discuss various symptoms and when you should be concerned that it might be something serious.  This includes answering the very important question &quot;When do you try to treat it yourself and when do you call a doctor?&quot;<br /><br />After this groundwork is laid and you and your doctor have determined that your back pain is nothing serious, the authors delve into a detailed program for alleviating your pain.  The first part details an exercise program and how exercise helps resolve back problems.  The appendix includes detailed stretching and other exercises.  Of course exercise is only part of the treatment plan, it also requires a healthy eating program.  Because excess weight can contribute to back pain losing weight and correcting unhealthy eating habits is part of a total approach.  This section also includes various dietary changes that keep bones strong, connective tissues healthy, and other health issues that can affect back pain in check.<br />In the interest of being thorough it also includes complementary and alternative medicine techniques that may help.  These include herbals, balms, back to basics of sitting, lifting, lying, and other normal activities, music therapy, biofeedback, massage, Rolfing, Pilates, chiropractic, osteopathy, acupuncture, and even surgery.<br />Of course all this advice is not of much help if you don't provide the details of how to get there.  So, the appendixes contain many recipes, exercises, references, and supporting information.

While Jason is visiting on the farm his grandfather brings home Earl the Emu.  Of course he is not like anything the other animals on the farm have ever seen before and they make fun of him.  Eventually Earl saves the day because of his difference and the other animals come to accept him as a friend.  This is a fine story with a strong moral lesson and is a recommended purchase.  However, it is not a book that holds a child's interest well because of the large ratio of words to pictures.  With each book of the series author Pat Winston has gotten better and better and the illustrations have improved significantly in the third and fourth of the series.  This book is important for those who are reading the series with children because it gives the answer to the question of how Earl got onto the farm in the first place and completes the collection.  But don't expect the child to read it or to sit still while you do.  After establishing interest with one of the other books come back to this one to fill in the gaps in the story.	2004-05-22

This is never truer than a romantic relationship between a man and a woman.  The purpose of &quot;How to Be Cherished&quot; is to help women figure out not only why your relationship might not be all you want it to be but also what you can do to make it the relationship you want.  By following the advice of the authors you can make yourself irresistible while also avoiding relationship pitfalls and before you know it you will realize you have the relationship you want.  Even if your relationship is already good, you can make it even better.  That's a pretty big promise to make but after reading the book I think they rise to the challenge.<br />If you are angry, if you are disappointed, even if you feel powerless in your relationship, you are powerful and can change it.  The first couple of chapters look at how strongly you affect the man in your life by your actions, comments, moods, and attitude.  As a man I have to say that the authors hit the nail right on the head here.  The woman generally sets the emotional tone in a relationship.  Men tend to be pretty much in emotional neutral most of the time until the woman sets the tone.  You are a lot more powerful than you think!<br />I found chapters three and four particularly interesting.  Chapter three deals with the fact that we all have a past.  To understand why people do what they do it is often important to understand their past and how it affects them now.  You have a past that you bring into the relationship, and he has a past that he brings into the relationship.  Understanding this helps you to understand each other.  The fourth chapter builds on this by looking at the fact that when you become hysterical and over react to something minor then what you are reacting to is something in your history.  Hence the chapter title, &quot;When You're Hysterical, It's Historical&quot;.  The authors point out that it can be your history, his history or both of your histories, but either way it is your past controlling the situation.  A healing process needs to start here to allow you to move forward in a positive relationship.<br />The next chapter starts the section on the actual keys to becoming cherished.  There is some really powerful stuff here.  Some of the real gems include empowering things like &quot;stop feeling like your relationship is happening to you&quot;; you are a part of it and can affect what happens.  Other great sections include learning forgiveness, how to stop pushing love away, and a great section on different aspects of love and becoming the object of his affection.<br />Another really good chapter is &quot;Thirteen Facts About Men&quot;.  The title caught my attention right away as I wondered whether these two women really understood men or not.  Well, they got this one totally accurate again.  If women really understood these things their relationship would be different.  While I may not agree with some of their explanations for why a particular trait is true they do get all thirteen of these totally accurate (even if some men wouldn't admit it).  The book is worth the price just for this chapter alone.<br />Of course there is a lot more to the book than just the portions I mentioned above.  I have to admit that my first reaction on receiving the book was that it was just another relationship book like the many others on the market.  I could not have been more wrong.

Books	4	11	11	N	N	Recommended for all new Christians	A small book with a powerful message, &quot;What Now Lord?&quot; is a Biblically sound guidebook to what you should expect after becoming a Christian.  This is a real-world examination of how God works in the life of a Christian instead of the all too common theoretical description of what &quot;should&quot; be happening.  Besides the expected guidance of Bible reading and establishing a prayer life he also tackles some of the common misconceptions of both new Christians and well-meaning older Christians.  For example, the second chapter is about hearing God's word.  Are you called to a specific purpose?  Is someone telling you that your personality or your education makes you a great potential missionary and that is an obvious direction God is calling you?  David Massey provides clear direction for determining whether you are being called by God for a particular purpose or are just being directed there by your inner desires and/or well-meaning friends.  How do you know you are being called?  This is a very important chapter.  Other chapters deal with things like drifting away - it happens.  He provides an excellent and detailed interpretation of the parable of the prodigal son.<br />Following that section he starts with the discipline needed to grow in the Christian life.  This area covers things like how to measure your progress, accountability and the use of small groups, the twelve steps for Christian living (a particularly good chapter) and evangelism.<br />While many churches hand out booklets on doctrine and similar items to the new convert, this is much more valuable and practical information for them to have.  &quot;What Now Lord?&quot; is a recommended read for new Christians and older Christians who don't feel they have grown in their Christian life since their conversion.	2004-05-10

Instead of giving each part of LAMP its own section the four sections focus on structure (getting them all up and working together), static web pages (creating and using them), dynamic web pages (getting the pages to do something via Perl and MySQL), and embedded programs (to make the whole system run quicker).  Each section covers all the components of LAMP as applied to that section.  For example, the structural section examines installation, configuration, security, and basic usage of Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl.  For Perl it includes a discussion of variables, arrays, operators, flow-control, regular expressions, functions, and file input/output.  For MySQL it includes working with tables, insert, select, update, and similar basic commands.  This is a very well done section and gives all the basic information necessary to get each of the components up and working with each other.  The section on static web pages mainly covers the use of Website META Language (WML) to generate a consistent look and feel across all the web pages on the server.  The part on dynamic web pages covers CGI and mod-perl so you can process information submitted by an html page or other CGI script.  It also includes information on using Perl to access the MySQL server and generate dynamic information.  The final section examines embedded programs such as Server Side Includes (SSI), embedded Perl, MASON, and PHP and how they are used to make a faster dynamic web site.<br />I have to say that I really liked this structure.  Once a system is set up it is rare to have to refer to the installation information again.  If it were organized by Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl then I would have to flip to what I assume is the appropriate section turn past the installation portion and try to locate what I am looking for.  This way, since it is organized by the various stages of getting the system up and running it is easier to find what I want.<br />The text includes lots of example coding so you can actually write and test it right away.  This is a great way to learn the basics.  It is not a thorough course in any of the four components but it does give you enough of a background to do most of what you might need to do.  Of course, what makes it really valuable is the fact that it covers how to get each of the components to work together without problems.  There are good books on each of these components but it is rare to find one that focuses on the interrelationships between them.  &quot;Open Source Web Development with LAMP&quot; is highly recommended for anyone who wants to set up a LAMP server or needing to work with one.e Includes (SSI), embedded Perl, MASON, and PHP and how they are used to make a faster dynamic web site.<br />I have to say that I really liked this structure.

Each chapter starts with a section called &quot;Instant Access&quot; where you will find a short summary of the information in the chapter.  If you are familiar with the basics of the information but just can't quite seem to remember the specific command or specific steps to do something you can quickly get up to speed in this section without browsing through the whole chapter.<br />I was somewhat surprised to find that the section on upgrading still contains information on upgrading from the old version 3 bindery system.  These days it is pretty unusual to find a version before 4.x but it is nice that he includes the version 3 upgrade information.  I was also glad to see a good discussion on planning the eDirectory.  This is an area where most books on Novell administration have fallen short.  An eDirectory tree that is poorly planned is difficult to manage well as users are added, new roles created, new departments or companies added, etc.  Planning it correctly up front based on good principles makes all the difference later.  The section on the eDirectory does a good job of putting the planner on the right track.<br />For Novell administrators with prior experience the coverage of all the new Internet based utilities is excellent.  ConsoleOne is covered in detail as well as some of the common snap-ins that make management through the eDirectory easier.  Also covered well are the Internet based printing system iPrint, Internet and browser based storage via iSCSI, iFolder, NetStorage, and NetDrive, and other parts of the OneNet initiative.  These tools make one of the easiest to administer, most secure, and stable networks available even easier to administer.  (An opinion based on working with Novell since version 2, Microsoft from 3.0, and various Linux and Unix versions for the last six years.  I've also taught all three of the server operating systems at the College level and installed many networks based on each system and mixes of them.)<br />Finally, he covers the Apache web server for Novell including setup and configuration and the Tomcat Servlet Engine.  He even includes a short section on MySQL, OpenSSH, Perl and PHP support in the Novell server environment.  The book ends with several useful appendixes that include detailed client properties information, login scripts, console commands, and detailed information on the eDirectory (including errors and DSRepair information).<br />The &quot;NetWare 6.5 Administrator's Handbook&quot; is highly recommended for anyone working in this environment and does an excellent job of not only providing the details you need to administer a Novell 6.5 network but also the theoretical background to understand exactly what is (or should be) happening.I've also taught all three of the server operating systems at the College level and installed many networks based on each system and mixes of them.)<br />Finally, he covers the Apache web server for Novell including setup and configuration and the Tomcat Servlet Engine.

Part of the reason is because of the difficulty of the exam.  &quot;Red Hat Certified Engineer Linux Study Guide, 4th Edition&quot; covers all the points of the exam very well and includes the information you need to work with Red Hat in the real world.  In addition to all the information you need to pass the exam, the book contains over 50 lab exercises and two complete RHCE exams and the entire book on CD.  If you plan on taking the exam do the labs, don't just read over them.<br />Michael Jang has consistently produced high quality books and this is one of his best.  The book is strongly slanted toward passing the exam, which is okay since that is exactly what it purports to be.  Throughout the book there are short comments marked off from the rest of the test which points to tips for real world items (called &quot;on the job&quot;) and tips for the exam (called &quot;exam watch&quot;).  Each chapter ends with a short summary, a &quot;two-minute drill&quot;, self-test questions, and lab questions.  The &quot;two-minute drill&quot; is great for exam preparation the day of the exam since it is pretty much the type of thing that you would put on note cards for a quick review anyway.<br />This is real-life advice and is full or tips and troubleshooting problems.  In the installation section it covers disk partitioning, swap space, bios limits, multiple controllers, and RAID.  Some good solid advice and information about things like problems with a computer with both a SCSI drive controller and IDE drive controller in the same system.  The installation troubleshooting section includes boot loaders, RAID, logical volumes, kickstart automated installation and pretty much everything you might run across.  It even includes how to boot up into single user mode, a very important ability for some administrative tasks and gaining root level access (full access to everything) to the system.  For some reason, although this is used in real-life for a lot of reasons, it seems to be left out of most books.  They will tell you to switch to single user mode to fix a problem or gain root access, but don't tell you how to do it.  This book tells you everything you need to know.  It includes not only the graphical and utility methods to do things but also includes the information for how it changes the configuration.  The information is so detailed that you can hand add the lines and/or configuration files and do it all by hand if you would prefer.  This way you understand exactly what each item does and it is much easier to troubleshoot problems.<br />The authors have included everything you need to know to install, troubleshoot, and administer a real-world server - shell configuration, kernel information, automation, X Windows installation and configuration, GNOME and KDE desktops, Apache server including security and virtual hosts, Squid proxy server configuration, secure FTP server, mail services including SMTP, sendmail, postfix, POP, and IMAP, Samba installation and configuration, printing services, DNS, BIND, DHCP, LDAP client configuration, firewall policies, network address translation, and the Linux rescue environment are examples of the breadth of coverage.<br />It even includes how to work with the automounter, another item that is left out of most other books.  The only error I found was on page 11, Table 1-2, where it has &quot;First IDE drive = /dev/had&quot; when it should be &quot;/dev/hda&quot;.  For that to be the only problem I found in a book of this size shows the care with which it was edited.<br />This is simply the best book I have seen if you want to become a general Linux &quot;guru&quot;.  Not only does it have everything you need to pass the exam, it has everything you need to install and administer a Linux network.  There are better books available on specific areas of Linux, for example a single chapter on Apache obviously cannot compete with a 600 page book on Apache server.  Then again, this the best book around if you want an understanding of Linux that is general enough to provide a complete overview of how Linux works in the real world and is also detailed enough to provide everything you need to get everything you want up and running.  &quot;Red Hat Certified Engineer Linux Study Guide, 4th Edition&quot; gets the highest recommendation I can give.cannot compete with a 600 page book on Apache server.

For software you will need either Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP Professional and InfoPath 2003.  To work with many web-enabled samples you will also need an Internet Information Server.  To compile and run many of the samples you will also need Visual Studio.NET 2003 or the .NET Framework 1.1.  It also require Microsoft Office 2003 and all associated products.  The book also assumes a basic knowledge of program development in a distributed environment (although the assumptions here are pretty minimal). You will note that all the software required is totally Microsoft.  If you are not willing to put on your Microsoft blinders and believe that nothing exists in the computer world other than Microsoft then you will not be particularly interested in Infopath nor this book.  On the other hand, if you are a totally Microsoft office, read on.<br />Infopath is Microsoft's collaborative environment for office automation and workflow control.  Using XML based forms a user can input information once and have it shared into Word, Excel, SQL, or other applications simultaneously.  Needless to say this can increase efficiency tremendously for situations where data has to be rewritten or cut-and-paste into different programs to keep it all up to date.  For those already working with Infopath, or planning to make that move, the book is an excellent guide to developing data sharing programs that take input with validation, store, extract, and update that information through easy to use forms, provide a secure solution, and integrate with Biztalk Server.<br />The approach of the author is to provide basic information and instruction interspersed with actual coding examples so you can actually test your knowledge and see the results.  This is one of the best teaching methods and he does an excellent job.  A quick view of the table of contents shows the highly organized layout of the book.  It starts with an examination of the Infopath integrated development environment (IDE), then follows with generating XML Forms, web service forms, and database forms, next is building workflow-enabled applications, integrating with BizTalk server, building smart client applications, securing solutions, and finally deploying your application.<br />For those developing applications in the InfoPath environment this is a top-notch guide that provides everything you need to know to start creating a collaborative working environment.

However, after becoming involved with one he dedicated himself to studying the problem and with the help of several addiction experts has produced this fascinating book.  One of the problems with alcoholism is that it has a tendency to not be diagnosed until it is too late and the person has ruined their health and their life.  Doug takes the view that by recognizing the behavioral clues we can find the hidden alcoholic while there is still time to prevent tragedy.<br />The book is divided into three distinct parts.  First is a section that redefines alcoholism so that earlier diagnosis and prevention is possible.  The second section is a detailed examination of the various clues that point to early-stage alcoholism.  The last section discusses middle-stage clues and clues of multiple drug use.<br />Many of the behavior items listed and detailed are indicative of addictive behavior in general and not necessarily just alcoholism.  The primary value in this book is that it is the first one I have seen that is designed for the general public and focuses on the early signs of alcoholism.  In fact, many of the professional level books do not deal with recognizing alcoholism at this early stage.  &quot;How to Spot Hidden Alcoholics&quot; should be required reading for everyone and especially so for those who deal with counseling others whether in a professional, volunteer, or pastoral capacity.	2004-05-03

Although it does have a section that it refers to as an &quot;Introduction to Perl&quot; it is actually a pretty cursory introduction and there are better books for learning the basics of Perl.<br />The book does have an excellent section on installing Perl including installation on both the Unix and Windows platforms.  I've worked with both platforms and the installation process is well documented including how to install modules.  This brings us to the large chapter on getting and installing Perl modules.  I have spent hours sometimes trying to find an appropriate module for a special situation.  This chapter lists all the most common modules and includes descriptions of what they do.  This alone makes it a valuable resource for anyone involved in Perl.<br />The authors also include a lot of technical information including command line options and environment variables as well as a section on program structure, data types, special variables, operators, expressions, subroutines, filehandles, and just about anything else that you might need a quick refresher on.<br />Functions are listed both by category and by alphabetical order with descriptions and syntax information.  I had a couple of problems on a large project recently and it took three days to get an answer through the forums on the Internet.  The answers to all of them are right here and I could have saved myself a lot of trouble if I had had this book then.<br />A lot of other information is available in the book including CGI programming, Webserver programming, database programming, SOAP, Network modules including Net, Mail, NNTP, FTP, and LDAP, Perl/Tk, Win32 Modules and Extensions, OLE Automation, and ODBC Extensions.

So often people fail to plan for their eventual death and everything they have spent years accumulating ends up in the hands of the court system, lawyers, and others.  Even when they do plan it often ends up in the hands of their children who may or may not be mature enough to handle the windfall.  The parable of the prodigal son often comes to mind as children squander their inheritance.<br />What can you do to make sure that your interests and your desires are foremost when it comes to passing on your inheritance?  That is the subject of this book.  How do you provide for children and grandchildren while still teaching them the value of money and the responsibility that comes with it?  How do you deal with the expectations of in-laws, stepchildren, and grandchildren, provide for church and ministries, avoid family conflict and avoid sibling jealousy?<br />Author Ron Blue delineates a clear process for dealing with these issues.  The process is basically to first determine why you should want to transfer your wealth, then to whom you want to transfer it, how much you want to transfer, when you want to do it, what you want to transfer, how you can do it, and communicating all the above to the appropriate people.  The advice is sound and he makes several good points that any financial planner would also advise you to do.  The only real problem with the book is that parts of it appear to be inconsistent with each other.  For example, on page 45 and again on page 154 under the heading of Tools and Techniques he notes the &quot;Trust Principle&quot; which he states is &quot;Never use a trust because of a lack of trust&quot;.  However, he never really defines what he means by that comment.  If it is &quot;never use a trust because you really can't trust the trustee to do what you want&quot; then that is not consistent with his suggestions on pages 167 through 174 where he suggests the use of a marital trust, an insurance trust, and possibly charitable remainder trusts, charitable lead trusts, etc.  On the other hand if he means that you should not use a trust as a vehicle to control a child's access to money because you don't trust the child then that is different but still not necessarily consistent with the basics of the rest of the book.  If the child is not mature enough to handle money then having it in a trust with someone who can is responsible stewardship.  Items like this make parts of the book questionable simply because the reader can't really tell what Mr. Blue is trying to say much less determine if it is sound advice.<br />Another problem with the book is some of the people he holds out as examples.  On page 50 he mentions Andrew Carnegie as an example of a person determined to give.  While this is factual and he did give away most of his fortune and supported many charities, he amassed his fortune through ruthless business practices that can hardly be considered as respectful of others.  To be fair to Mr. Carnegie most of his practices were not inconsistent with others of his day and it is unfair to compare his work ethics with those of a more worker sensitive environment of today.  I'm sure that Mr. Blue would not want people to draw the conclusion that it is okay to abuse others if the resulting income is given away to charities.  There are just better examples, some of which he does include (such as S. Truett Cathy).<br />Along a similar vein, it would have been better if the quotes used on the inside and dust cover were not from people who stood to benefit from increased contributions to charities and churches (a position highly promoted throughout the book).  Of the 13 people quoted only three of them are not directly connected with an organization that would benefit directly if more people contributed to charitable organizations or churches in their wills.  This does not make the advice any less sound; it just establishes a credibility gap.  The people quoted are all from Christian organizations and so one would hope that they can rely on an honest assessment of the book, but it still raises questions of independence.  The book is good enough that there should be ample positive reviews from people who are not officers or founders of charities or churches.<br />Although I obviously have some problems with this book, taken as a whole it is one of the best basic guides to Christian oriented planning and wealth transfer.  The advice includes all the basic guidance you would receive from most competent financial planners - give it to your heirs while you are alive, use marital trusts if appropriate, use life insurance trusts, plan to use your wealth in ways that are consistent with your beliefs and goals in life.  He also does a good job of pointing out that the tools and techniques should be near the end of the process instead of at the beginning of the planning process.  It just makes more sense to first determine your goals and then to use the tools and techniques that get you there.  While I believe it could be better with better writing and more carefully chosen examples, the basic tenets of the book are financially solid and Biblically sound.  &quot;Splitting Heirs&quot; is one of the best books available to understand the problems of wealth transfer from a Christian perspective.st establishes a credibility gap.

It is not without its problems but they are generally pretty minor and in fact somewhat humorous at times.  For example, page 84 has a section titled &quot;Upgrading to SQL Server 6.5&quot; and page 90 a section titled &quot;Upgrading to Earlier Versions of SQL Server&quot;.  Obviously you don't upgrade to an earlier version nor do you upgrade from 2000 to 6.5.  So, while there are errors, they are so obvious as to not be a big problem.  When it comes to the technical details where accuracy is critical, I didn't find any obvious errors.<br />So what does the book cover?  It starts with the different types of DBAs, the different versions of SQL Server 2000 available, installation methods and resolving installation problems.  After getting everything installed and working correctly it moves on to working with the database with things like creating a database, basic considerations for databases (such as raid levels), and everyday administrative activities like making the database read-only, removing databases, adding databases, changing the path, creating and deleting tables.  One of the things I liked about this section (and most of the sections of the book) was that it explained how to do each task by using the database manager and by using the Transact-SQL language.<br />Each of the sections follows logically from the prior one.  With all the database management section completed the next part covers doing queries, joins, creating indexes, and similar tasks, basic backing up and restoring databases, generating a database script, creating and adding jobs, working with security and authentication, user permissions, roles, application security, ODBC, ADO, performance monitoring, and other tasks.<br />Although it was mentioned in brief in an earlier chapter, chapter eight provides a thorough treatment of backup and recovery.  This is a very important chapter, I have run across many, many SQL installations where people did not understand the correct backup and restore procedures for SQL and made a complete mess of their system using copy and paste techniques.  The author does an excellent job here and it will keep you out of trouble if you follow his advice.<br />The remaining portion of the book covers replication (a particularly well-done chapter), writing Transact-SQL code, creating views, error handling, writing triggers, data warehousing, data analysis, and creating a data transformation package using the data transformation package editor.  Due to the breadth of coverage &quot;Beginning SQL Server 2000 DBA: From Novice to Professional&quot; is exactly as advertised and useful to both the complete novice and the experienced professional.  Note that although it covers some of the more common uses of T-SQL for administrative purposes it is not a book on programming, it is a book on administration and within that defined area it is excellent.  &quot;Beginning SQL Server 2000 DBA&quot; is a highly recommended read.earlier chapter, chapter eight provides a thorough treatment of backup and recovery.

Of course you don't have to use a real stone these days as cement can be used to create the troughs.  But, whether stone or cement it still ends up extremely heavy.  One way to get around this is to mix peat moss with the cement.  This produces a much lighter weight, porous trough that looks like stone.  That is the focus of this particular gardening book - how to make these &quot;hypertufa&quot; troughs, what plants do well in them, and some basic plan layouts for using them in a garden design.  Pictures of the troughs created by these techniques show troughs and stones that appear very old with lichens and mosses growing on the sides.  They remind me very much of pictures of ancient Mayan or Indonesian stone ruins.  For anyone who wants to add this type of accent or wants to create a garden that has the appearance of ancient stone structures this is a book you will want to have.	2004-05-03

Often these speeches leave the students encouraged and with a deeper understanding of their role in business and in life.  Author Daisy Wademan, a graduate of Harvard Business School, has collected some of these talks into her new book &quot;Remember Who You Are&quot;.  It is a collection of fifteen of what she considers the most influential speeches from her professors.  For each one there is a short vignette about the professor followed by the actual speech.  Each speech is only a few pages long and takes only a couple of minutes to read but could influence your leadership skills for years.  &quot;Remember Who You Are&quot; is a recommended read for anyone in a leadership position or who hopes to be there.	2004-05-03

The focus of the book is to take that next step and find ways that you can move through guilt and anger and create a working relationship with your parents.  To this end the book contains lots of examples from Dr. Atkins' actual patient files.  It also includes exercises to work through, questionnaires to help you understand yourself and your relationship with your parents,  and various lessons to illustrate the principles involved.<br />The first part of the book focuses on you.  It includes an examination of ways to take control of your life so your past doesn't control your present, how to deal with guilt and parents who use it to control you, and anger.<br />The next part changes focus to your parents.  How did they grow up?  What did they go through as they were growing up?  What was their life like?  The focus is on developing empathy so you can use it to develop forgiveness.  One of the most important points of the chapter is realizing that your fantasy parent doesn't exist.  Not only do they not exist but also those fantasy perfect parents that your friends seemed to have were not perfect either.  Two of the coping techniques covered in this chapter include creating reasonable expectations for yourself and your parents and creating appropriate boundaries.<br />The last section discusses the most common problems when dealing with parents.  For example, some of the problems covered include the bait and switch technique, manipulating you with a health crisis, becoming easily offended when you don't share personal details of your life, putting you in the middle of their problems, or using money to manipulate you.<br />If you have a troubled relationship with your parents and are seeking to change, you should consider picking up a copy of &quot;I'm OK, You're My Parents&quot;.ents&quot;.	2004-04-27

The author assumes no previous knowledge of SQL or even database theory and design so you really start at the beginning.  In fact chapter five, database design, is one of the more lucid explanations of relational databases and design theory that I have read anywhere.<br />Another item that differentiates this book from others of the same genre is the inclusion of a chapter of SQL recipes.  This chapter is basically a cookbook that takes the most common tasks you may need to accomplish with your MySQL database and provides a recipe to accomplish that task.<br />It includes coverage of InnoDB tables (very important in a multi-user environment) and many other items besides the usual installation, administration, and configuration items you would expect.  Of course, if you are writing a MySQL application you will have to use some sort of programming language to write your program.  In keeping with the OpenSource theme of the book it includes extensive coverage of PHP, Perl, Java, C, C++, Visual Basic, C#, and ODBC.  The book does not pretend to teach any of these programming languages but provides the information to use them with MySQL if you know that particular language.  As a regular user of PHP, Perl, Visual Basic, and ODBC connections I found the coverage to be excellent, including everything you need to know to connect to the database and do whatever you need.<br />The book ends with an excellent reference section, a section on MySQL Tools, and even a section an API reference.  In short it is one of the most exhaustive books on the subject and provides everything for a new user as well as complete reference coverage for an experienced user, programmer, or administrator.  &quot;The Definitive Guide to MySQL, Second Edition&quot; is highly recommended for anyone interested in learning, administering, or programming MySQL.nterested in learning, administering, or programming MySQL.	2004-04-27

But that is where the resemblance to a traditional Bible ends.  A lot of people will probably have a hard time accepting a Bible of this nature but a lot will also find it the best idea in youth Bibles in a long time.  I tend toward the second group.<br />So, what makes this Bible so different?  The first thing that grabs your attention is the fact that it has the same layout and style as a modern teen magazine.  In addition to the Bible there are music reviews, suggestions on how to live your faith, life guidance ideas, tips for understanding girls (the Refuel version is designed for teenage boys) and a lot of other items of contemporary interest.  I have to say that this is one of the most difficult reviews that I have ever had to write because you really cannot appreciate the appeal of this Bible until you actually see it.  It stays true to the traditional Bible and New Century Version and so provides the complete story of the New Testament while at the same time providing visual appeal and guidance in a manner that is much more likely to appeal to a teenage boy.  It is easy to pick up and just start reading and inviting to leaf through and read a few sections at a time.<br />Now, having sung the praises of this wonderful Bible and how strongly it appeals to teenagers I will have to note that although the scripture is an accurate rendering of the Bible as translated in the New Century Version, the filler pieces, columns, and short articles do at times advance particular positions that all Christians may not necessarily hold.  I might as well go after one of the really big ones as an example.  Page 126 has a listing of ten &quot;Random Causes Worth Standing For&quot;.  The first item on the list is &quot;The Rights of the Unborn&quot;.  While this is somewhat vague it obviously comes down on the side of Pro-Life.  Some Christians agree with this and some do not, and most seem to want to take all the facts and circumstances of a particular case into consideration (such as when the mother's life is in danger).  Of course, the wise parent can use these things as a way to open the door to discussion and an opportunity to teach their children.  My point is not to attack or defend the various positions but to make the reader aware that such items are in the book.<br />All in all &quot;Refuel: The Complete New Testament&quot; is one of the most exciting innovations to come along in youth Bibles in a long time.  In my opinion a Bible that a teenager will actually pick up and read is far more valuable than one that sits on a shelf and is rarely, if ever, opened.  &quot;Refuel&quot; is a complete marketing makeover for the Bible while still retaining a true translation at the core.  Brilliant!down on the side of Pro-Life.

In fact it seems that over the past several years the news media has become more and more the servant of politics instead of the reporter.  In &quot;The Exception to the Rulers&quot; author Amy Goodman delves into the political relationships that are typically not reported in the media.  She provides a well-researched look into the rampant corruption of powerful leaders and how the media helps enhance their power at the expense of the average person.<br />This is a book that should be required reading for anyone interested in politics or trying to understand why when the BBC and US media both report on the same incident it is hard to believe they are talking about the same one.  Author Amy Goodman provides a tight, consistent, and highly readable illustration of the web of deception and multiple relationships between our highest leaders and the companies they use to create ever-increasing personal wealth.  &quot;The Exception to the Rulers&quot; deserves the highest of recommendations.	2004-04-27

It does not include any of Louisiana or Florida and excludes most of southern Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina.  For this deep south region the author provides advice and a list of common questions and answers for each of the four seasons.  The information includes when to prepare beds for particular perennials and annuals, what flowers, trees, vines, or other plants are most appropriate, how to deal with various problems, etc.  The questions and answers are a collection of actual questions asked by gardeners on author Nellie Neal's SuperTalk MS Radio Network program.

Rapp, M.D. is Board Certified in Environmental Medicine, Pediatrics and Allergies.  In her book &quot;Our Toxic World&quot; she shares her knowledge of how everyday toxins in our environment affect us.  The reality is that chemicals are everywhere in our lives and it is nearly impossible to completely escape them.  It would surprise most people to find that these chemicals not only affect our physical health but also our actions, behavior (aggression, fatigue, hyperactivity, etc.), fertility, and even our memory.  Through this book Doris Rapp rings the alarm about how pesticides and chemicals have become major factors in chronic illnesses of all kinds.<br />Of course the book is not just about all the problems of toxins but also includes sound advice on how to choose safer products and protect yourself.  She also dedicates several chapters to discussing wildlife research data and lab data.  While this is interesting information to a point, she includes so much detail and so many examples that it starts to read like a research paper instead of a book for the general public.<br />I did like her summarizing statement that we are creating stronger more chemically-resistant pests and weeds and weaker, more unhealthy humans.  In addition to the toxins she also discusses genetic engineering and the potential health problems it may cause.  If you are concerned about the toxic environment and how it may be affecting your health you will be hard pressed to find a more informative, better-documented book than &quot;Our Toxic World&quot;.	2004-04-22

The sequence is pretty straight forward - rapture, seven years of tribulation, Christ's second coming, establishment of God's kingdom on earth.  While that seems to be the program that sells the most books, it is not the only opinion on the end times.  Some people believe the rapture will come before the tribulation, others that it will come half way through the tribulation, others that it will occur at the end of the tribulation, and still others that there will be no rapture at all.<br />Why all the different opinions?  Prophecy is open to various interpretations.  In &quot;End Time Delusions&quot; author Steve Wohlberg provides a solid and convincing case for questioning if there will be a rapture as it is traditionally taught.  He also discussed exactly what the tribulation is, the problem of the antichrist, Christ's second coming, and various other ideologies related to the end times.  Throughout the book he points out that for the first century and a half or so nobody interpreted the rapture or tribulation the way it is done now.  That is not to say they did not consider end times events the way it is taught today.  Quite the opposite, some of the early church fathers that he quotes point out why they believe the way they do and why other beliefs are in error.  These beliefs that they considered erroneous include concepts like a pre-tribulation rapture.<br />This book is important because it provides a logical explanation of an alternative view of prophecy.  Well organized and well-presented, &quot;End Times Delusions&quot; is a solid argument against the mainstream position on the end times and a recommended read to anyone who wants to understand alternative theories.	2004-04-21

It begins with an examination of trauma, the trauma incident network, and unblocking.  This is followed by an excellent essay on the psychological foundations of TIR.  Included in this chapter is an examination of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and why cognitive restructuring is required for successful treatment of PTSD.<br />After this foundational chapter the essays start examining particular types of trauma, how they function, how they are similar, how they are different, and how to work with them.  First is an examination of the traumas of war, both as a civilian caught up in it and as a soldier.  Then come essays on grief and loss, crime and punishment, terrorism, accident victims, accidental death, and various other type of emotional trauma.<br />The final portion of the book examines working with TIR and children, integrating TIR and Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, using TIR in a psychotherapy practice, and integrating TIR with other disciplines.<br />If you are working with trauma or just want to understand TIR this is a good beginning book.  It clearly delineates the basics of TIR as a desensitization procedure and its effectiveness as a true resolution to trauma related problems.  &quot;Beyond Trauma&quot; is a recommended book for the professional or for the lay reader who wants to know about this technique before possibly seeking out a practitioner.	2004-04-21

Books	5	28	28	N	N	A holistic and educational approach to weight loss	In some ways this is another book on the difficulties of dieting and why it often does not work.  On the other hand, it provides one of the most thorough examinations of weight problems that you can find.  Most of the book has almost nothing to do with dieting.  Instead the author examines emotional factors in weight control, psychological factors, self-esteem, biochemical individuality, hormones, minerals, toxicity, food allergies, blood type, emotional balance, stress, toxic pollutants, and even parasites.  In short, she examines all the various factors that have been attributed to weight problems.<br />She does an excellent job of discussing the role of psychological factors and how they influence your weight.  Whether it is eating for the wrong reasons, dealing with limiting beliefs, healing your inner child,  dealing with shame or a critical inner voice, or self-esteem, no area escapes examination.  She even points an accusing finger in the direction of doctors, referring to some as &quot;finger-pointers in white lab coats&quot;.<br />Another particularly good part of the book is where she discusses how a diet has to fit you.  An effective diet has to match your biochemical individuality, carbohydrate sensitivity, insulin resistance, thyroid function and metabolic rate, hormone balance, etc.<br />Some readers may have problems where she varies from the traditional view and heads off into the area of alternative medicine.  However, she makes a valid point that in the interest of presenting a thorough examination of the issue she has included this information.  In this section she closely examines toxicity and how to detoxify your body.  Included is information on colon cleansing and parasites as well as the use of natural remedies.<br />I have to say it is refreshing to find a book that looks at this problem from all sides instead of taking the position that something that worked for one person is the perfect solution for everyone.  It just is not that simple.  &quot;Fat and Furious&quot; is a highly recommended read for anyone seeking a solution to diets that don't work and who want to understand the various factors involved in controlling your weight.&quot;Fat and Furious&quot; is a highly recommended read for anyone seeking a solution to diets that don't work and who want to understand the various factors involved in controlling your weight.	2004-04-21

This edition uses screenshots from RedHat Fedora.  The index in the prior edition was not as thorough as I would have liked.

Even with the shortcomings in the prior version it was still the best certification study<br />guide that I had reviewed.  This edition is an improvement on the best study guide available, making it the new champ.<br />One of the things I like best about Sybex certification books is that they are one of the few publishers who provide both the information needed to pass the exam and the information needed to actually work in the real world.  All the most common networking and administrative tasks, troubleshooting, adding packages, adding hardware, and installation are covered in detail including installation methods and problems, security, file services, and troubleshooting.

For those who are serious historians and wish to check primary sources or other information the author provides documentation in the form of 45 pages of appendices, 33 pages of histography, a 27 page bibliography, and 56 pages of notes.  For those less inclined to study at that level the easy-to-read style of David Fischer makes the book a great read.  He closely examines the makeup of the various military units including the Hessian regiments, British regulars, Scottish Highland regiments, Connecticut Light Horse regiment, Hamilton's Artillery, regiments of riflemen, etc.  He also examines the background and history of Washington, the Howe brothers, Cornwallis, and many other major players in the war.  After reading &quot;Washington's Crossing&quot; you come away with a deeper understanding and appreciation for what the American and British forces went through and what each was trying to accomplish at various stages of the war.  This was a critical time for the American militia and David Fischer drives the point home well as he takes you through one unsuccessful campaign after another until the tide finally turned for the American troops.  Each side is carefully examined in terms of fatigue, moral, military planning.  What happened, why it happened and the effect it had on the war at that point.  A fascinating trip into history it is an excellent read and highly recommended.	2004-04-13

I've seen them help keep a family close together because they are involved with each other throughout the day.  On the other hand I've seen it tear a business and a family apart as family members make decisions that others don't support, personal problems are brought into the office, and promoting one family member over another causes hardship.  It's no wonder that almost seventy percent of family owned businesses fail in the second generation.  Does this have to be the case?  What can you do to keep from being just another of these statistics?  That is what Laura Michaud addresses in her book &quot;From the Kitchen Table to the Conference Table: Family Business Communication&quot;.<br />Laura grew up in a third generation family owned business - Beltone.  Based on her real-life experiences Laura provides a solid plan for navigating the treacherous waters of a family owned business.  Her plan is thorough and includes many things people don't think about when starting a family business.  For example, there is the need to examine the fact that family members may have different goals.  Some may need medical benefits, some may want more take home pay, and others may want more flexible time demands.  Another example is planning for succession.  Most people just think of planning for who will take over the business when they pass on or retire.  But succession planning is so much more than this.  If it is not done correctly the company may need to be sold just to pay estate taxes.  Or leaving the business jointly to several children may set them up for crippling power struggles.  These are only two of the many areas she covers very well.  The majority of the book is dedicated to finding the individual strengths of family members and making sure that the company plays to their strengths and then keeping communication channels open.<br />There are several books on the market that examine starting a family business and how to get it growing.  I am really surprised that there are not more that deal with the problem of the expanding family business that soon has dozens of grandchildren, cousins, and in-laws working for it.

For example, there are a couple of references to Word Publishing as a division of Thomas Nelson Publishing.  Word Publishing no longer exists.  Still this is the only outdated information I found in the entire book, which is pretty amazing.  &quot;The Christian Writer's Manual of Style&quot; is a highly recommended read for anyone writing for the Christian market, and especially if you are writing non-fiction.	2004-04-13

Patrika Vaughn's book &quot;Everything You Need to Know to Write, Publish &amp; Market Your Book&quot; has everything you need to get started.  Many books are available in the writing genre but this one has a few things that set it apart.  The first thing I noticed is that she really starts at the beginning.  The first chapter starts with examining why you want to write and how this colors your writing.  It also examines what to do once you know what you want to write, and methods to keep yourself motivated.<br />One of the better sections is a short chapter that deals with how to cure writing fears.  Everyone who writes has them at times but not everyone knows how to get around them.  Patrika Vaughn obviously does.  Other exceptional chapters include ones on writing an effective beginning, developing the action, and developing characters.  Poor character development is one of the leading causes of novels that can't keep a reader's interest.  When it comes to hooking the reader and then keeping them interested in the characters and plot this book teaches all the basics.<br />The last part of the book covers how to approach the market, how to submit your presentation, and even self-publishing.  The sections on approaching the market and presenting your book or proposal are both excellent.  &quot;Everything You Need to Know to Write, Publish &amp; Market Your Book&quot; is a recommended read for anyone who wants a top quality overview of the writing, publishing, and marketing business.  It is very evident from the writing style and information that Patrika Vaughn knows exactly what she is talking about.  If you are looking for help with a specific area of writing such as plot design there are better books that focus just on that area.  However, if you want a strong overview and a clear understanding of what is needed to become a writer and how to go about it, you can't go wrong with this book.come a writer and how to go about it, you can't go wrong with this book.	2004-04-09

At one time in the very recent past anyone supporting the idea of a Creator of the universe would have been ridiculed in the scientific community.  These days they seem to be in the majority with more and more converts every year.  In his book &quot;The Case for a Creator&quot; author Lee Strobel goes over the evidence that is causing such a shift in thinking.<br />In a very easy to read interview writing style he discusses evolution, Darwinism, science and faith, the big bang theory of cosmology, physics, astronomy and probability, biochemistry, DNA, and consciousness.  For each one of these subjects he delivers an interview with a top scientist who is a specialist in that particular field of knowledge.  Here is your chance to listen in as Lee quizzes them on their reasoning and theories.  Listen in as he asks the difficult questions and receives soundly reasoned answers.<br />While these are recognized experts in their fields it should be noted that they were, of course, hand picked because they believe in a creator.  As a result the book is basically an opportunity for them to espouse their views and give answers to common objections.  Still, hand picked or not, the important thing is that they provide soundly reasoned, realistic answers to the questions and problems posed.<br />If you received an education on evolution in school then you owe it to yourself to at least be fair and learn the other side of the coin.  If you have come to doubt a creator for whatever reason and have been taught that science has no room for a creator then you owe it to yourself to see why top scientists are moving over to the creation camp.  At least you will find that there are two sides to this debate and it is not a closed question coming down on the side of no creator.  &quot;The Case for a Creator&quot; is a highly recommended read on one of the most enjoyable books on the subject that I have read.njoyable books on the subject that I have read.	2004-04-09

On the good side this work follows up on the prior book with much more detailed information on how to write better.  The different CDs cover &quot;Why Your Writing Isn't Working&quot;, &quot;Openings That Hook Readers&quot;, &quot;Choosing Your Voice&quot;, &quot;Bringing Characters to Life&quot;, and &quot;Plots that Intrigue&quot;.  As usual she does an excellent job on these subjects and the information is sure to improve the writing of anyone trying to break into the writing market.  She does a really good job with the ones on &quot;Openings that Hook Readers&quot; and &quot;Plots that Intrigue&quot;.  These are perhaps the most important parts of good writing and so many people do them badly.<br />There were two things about the CDs that I found annoying.  First is that every CD had the same opening information repeated on it.  It was appropriate on the first one in order to introduce herself and make sure the listener knows exactly what a writer's advocate does.  But repeating it at the beginning of each CD was marketing overkill and annoying.  The only other problem was the actual speech pattern used on the CDs.  The conversation was choppy and hesitant like one of the old documentary school movies from the 1950's.  At times I felt like shouting, &quot;Just say it and move on&quot;.<br />The bottom line here is that the CDs are valuable and contain very good lessons on how to improve your writing.  If you can patiently work through the presentation you will be rewarded.  &quot;The Writer's Toolbox&quot; is a recommended purchase for anyone wanting to improve his or her writing.	2004-04-09

Are we working against our own biological programming when we diet and so it becomes a waste of time over the long run?  These are questions that David Hariton answers in the affirmative in his book &quot;Survival of the Thinnest&quot;.  In his book he examines the needs of the hunter/gatherer man and how the gene code worked for them.  Now, it seems that that same gene code is the very thing that causes us to put on those extra pounds.  What can you do about it?  Actually it is fairly easy, work in conjunction with that gene code so that it becomes your ally instead of your enemy.  That is the basic premise of the book, what you can do to work with your body instead of against it.  This is not entirely new research in the area and not a particularly new idea, but I will have to say that he does an excellent job of describing the idea so that the average reader can understand it.  Equipped with this knowledge they can then take control of their body type (assuming no actual medical reason such as glandular problems).  Because he explains it so well and leaves the reader with a good understanding of what needs to be done, &quot;Survival of the Thinnest&quot; is a recommended read.	2004-04-09

However, the book does not stop with designs but also includes information on maintenance, various types of pool equipment, and even the process of installing an in ground pool.  While the coverage of in ground pool installation is not detailed enough to do it yourself it does give you an idea of what is going on at the various stages so you know what to expect from your contractor.<br />If you are even thinking of installing a pool or spa, whether in ground, above ground, or portable, you should pick up a copy of &quot;Pools &amp; Spas&quot;.

On the one hand, &quot;What's Next&quot; doesn't add anything new to one of the interpretations that has been around for a long time.  But it does describe it in a simple, straight-forward way without getting the reader all involved in the details of specific verse translations and the like.  It presents the view that the events of Revelation are still yet to occur, a great leader will come out of Europe to bring a temporary peace to the Mid-East, the battle of Armageddon will occur, God will establish his kingdom on earth, and similar.<br />What makes this book unique is the beginning where author Charles H. Dyer provides a very even-handed and reasonable treatment of the Mid-East situation.  At a time when many Christian authors are decrying the evilness of the Arabs and Muslims without any factual knowledge of their religion or culture it is refreshing to find a voice crying in the wilderness that these are our neighbors too and they are real people.  He provides welcome insight into the religious and cultural history of people whom he knows personally in contrast to the few radicals that we always hear about on the news.<br />&quot;What's Next?&quot; is a highly recommended read that provides an insightful view into the Mid-East situation in addition to a basic overview of the end-times as understood by the author and many other Christians.	2004-04-03

Through a series of interviews it tells the story of real people and their loss, survival, and life changes as a result of the attack.  The people interviewed include nurses, firefighters, police officers, people who lost a loved one, those who cried with someone who did, and those who were caught in the economic aftermath.<br />New York's Chinatown district was devastated by the loss of jobs as travel to New York came almost to a standstill.  Businesses closed, people lost their jobs, and the whole area suffered.  While this is true of the majority of New York, the Asian American/Pacific Islander community provides a good microcosm view of the situation.  Through these interviews Icy Smith brings these people to life so the reader comes to know that these are not just anonymous individuals but real people with families, friends, and real lives that interact with many others in much the same way that all of us do.  It also points to the solidarity of this community, as the struggles of a few become the struggles of the many.<br />The book finishes with interviews from Muslim and Sikh Americans as they call for tolerance and understanding.  &quot;Voices of Healing&quot; is an interesting read that does an excellent job of presenting the plight of the people through personal interviews.	2004-04-03

Although it is written in an easy to understand style it is still full of very valuable information.  For example, people often ask why there are so many different translations of the Bible.  The authors do an excellent job of showing the complications and difficulties of translating and how different versions of a verse could each be just as viable as an accurate translation.<br />The authors also deal with the problems of interpretation, exegesis, historical and cultural context and literary conventions of the time.  They look at the narrative style of the Old Testament and its function as well as Acts, the various parables, prophets, psalms, wisdom literature, and the revelation.  You may not agree with every aspect of their treatment of the various books and literary styles, but this is the best treatment of the problems of translation and interpretation that I have come across to date.  &quot;How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth&quot; is highly recommend for anyone interested in Bible translation or interpretation.	2004-03-29

The cover strongly suggests that it is another business development book.  With a dollar sign and a subtitle of &quot;Business Success and Inner Development Through High Performance Training, Self-Motivation &amp; Warrior Spirit&quot; it is easy to understand why.  This classification could not be further from the truth.  This is a very valuable self-improvement book that could help people truly change their lives.  In fact, it is one of the best self-improvement books I have read in a long time.<br />Author, Charles Lambert, Ed.D. brings together current research on motivation, personality types, psychology, physics, and the martial arts into a cohesive whole to help the reader change their life.  For each part he includes various exercises to illustrate the points and help the reader understand exactly what is happening.  This is all organized into five &quot;Modules&quot; for the reader to work through to achieve the desired results.<br /><br />The first module deals primarily with mental rehearsal and cognitive hygiene.  Cognitive hygiene is his term for cleaning up the clutter in the mind related to negative self-talk.  Dr. Lambert does a phenomenal job of describing the problem of self-talk and providing a positive, workable method of dealing with it.  It is amazing that he can deal with this subject so well in just a couple of chapters when whole books have been written about it and have not done as good a job.<br />Module two is on focusing and concentration.  Again, this is an excellent treatment of the subject and includes several exercises to help you learn better focus and concentration.  The author's background in the martial arts shines through strongly here as he blends ancient focus philosophies and modern techniques.<br />Of the remaining modules, module three covers various ways of applying the skills learned in the prior modules.  Module four focuses on using the martial spirit, persistence and motivation to achieve your dreams.  This includes a strategy for enjoying your life on a daily basis and keeping yourself motivated over the long term.  Module five is a short section basically designed for coaches, managers, and anyone else who needs to motivate others.<br />&quot;Your Inner Edge!&quot; is a highly recommended read for anyone seeking to change their life, improve their business, improve their self-image, or otherwise improve their life.ses on using the martial spirit, persistence and motivation to achieve your dreams.

This is great and represents a pretty substantial vocabulary however, it is still annoying to have to stop every few words and look one up.  That is where this book comes in handy.<br />It is a standard Greek New Testament except for one thing.  Each word that occurs less than 50 times is footnoted at the bottom of the page.  As appropriate the footnoted word may indicate case, idiomatic use, voice, figurative use, or other information to help the reader understand how the word was used.  This ability to read the text without having to continuously refer to another book makes reading a pleasure again instead of a chore.  &quot;A Reader's Greek New Testament&quot; is highly recommended for anyone who already has a basic understanding of Biblical Greek.	2004-03-29

Is there some kind of collective dream world that we all share in and that through it we affect each other?  These are the kind of questions author Tess Castleman, a Jungian Analyst based out of Dallas, Texas, examines in her book &quot;Threads, Knots, Tapestries&quot;.  Her primary area of interest and expertise is the use of dream groups.  After years of studying these groups she now shares her experience and how common dream threads demonstrate our interconnectedness with each other.<br />Some schools of psychology teach that all the characters of your dream are just different parts of yourself.  Is it possible that there are times when a dream is much more than this?  Tess Castleman examines situations where it appears there is some type of communal dreaming occurring.  Apparently there is some sort of collective dream world that we can all access and do at times.  Going one step further she shows how we may be interacting not only other people, but also with our environment itself, or even with other cultures.<br />&quot;Threads, Knots, Tapestries&quot; is a fascinating trip into the realm of possibilities and how closely we may all be bound together in the web of life.	2004-03-27

Some were so funny that I just had to share them right away, and others were only mildly humorous.  Then when I shared the book with someone else they thought some of the other ones even more humorous.  Well I guess that has always been the case with puns, everyone has their idea of what is funniest.  It is a fairly short book and can be read through in about fifteen minutes or so at the most.  I would say that it makes a nice short diversion on a busy day to pick it up and enjoy one or two of the puns except I found I couldn't put it down until I had read them all.	2004-03-21

The book is about breaking free from the molds you are trying to squeeze into just to satisfy others.  Throughout the book Carrie Smith provides a gentle coaching method to get you to start breaking free and living a life true to yourself.<br />The book starts out by correcting false conceptions of reality - Barbie is not real, most magazine images are fake, don't base your idea of reality on fantasy, don't compare yourself to other women.  Of course it does not end there but goes on into other ways that women tend to try to fit into the molds of others.  Examples of these include games like the perfection game, reward and punishment, and head games you use to fool yourself into thinking you are healthier than you really are.  All the head games are basically things we do to ourselves or that others do to us in order to alter our perception of reality.  She concludes the body size section with a simple, yet profound statement.  Don't give yourself away to the marketing hype, your true size is the size you were meant to be - the size your body is most happy with.  Instead of striving for a size, strive for well-being.<br />Other suggestions include getting rid of clutter, both physical and mental.  Decide what is important and get on with your life.  She then turns back to the striving for well-being and discusses using your eating personality to your advantage, choosing a personal trainer, and myths and misunderstandings about exercise, strength training, etc.  This is a recommended book for anyone who wants to proclaim independence from the commercial and social entrapments of life and become who they were meant to be.  Will it work?  I don't know.  For many people it is an intense struggle to try to overcome the constant bombardments of the media trying to force you into a mold that will create a regular stream of monetary income for them.  This book shines a light onto the correct path, but it is not an easy walk in our current social environment.any people it is an intense struggle to try to overcome the constant bombardments of the media trying to force you into a mold that will create a regular stream of monetary income for them.

Maybe.	Is it possible that our dreams affect others and the dreams of others affect ours?  Is there some kind of collective dream world that we all share in and that through it we affect each other?  These are the kind of questions author Tess Castleman, a Jungian Analyst based out of Dallas, Texas, examines in her book &quot;Threads, Knots, Tapestries&quot;.  Her primary area of interest and expertise is the use of dream groups.  After years of studying these groups she now shares her experience and how common dream threads demonstrate our interconnectedness with each other.  <br />Some schools of psychology teach that all the characters of your dream are just different parts of yourself.  Is it possible that there are times when a dream is much more than this?  Tess Castlemen examines situations where it appears there is some type of communal dreaming occurring.  Apparently there is some sort of collective dream world that we can all access and do at times.  Going one step further she shows how we may be interacting not only other people, but also with our environment itself, or even with other cultures.<br />&quot;Threads, Knots, Tapestries&quot; is a fascinating trip into the realm of possibilities and how closely we may all be bound together in the web of life.	2004-03-17

The problem is that most don't know what to do about those negative emotions and how to release the stranglehold that emotions often have on a person.  &quot;The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being&quot; deals with a specific method of releasing these negative emotions and allowing you to find an inner balance and peace in your life.<br />The Sedona Method is really fairly simple although it is also quite powerful.  Author Hale Dwoskin writes in a clear style that allows any reader to understand and follow the technique step-by-step until they achieve the results they want.  This is not a quick fix that you can read once and be done, it is a method, a technique that can be learned and practiced until it becomes second nature.<br />As a result of being able to release these emotions as soon as they come up you end up becoming more accepting and having more peace in your life all the time.  The book contains several testimonials of people who have followed the technique and achieved success.  Some will find these testimonials helpful in understanding the ways that negative emotions affect our lives and the benefits of releasing them.  Others will find the number of testimonials an annoying interruption to the general flow of the book.  All in all, this is an excellent resource for those dealing with harboring negative emotions and a highly recommended read.	2004-03-17

Books	5	6	6	N	N	Interesting and fun book	A fascinating trip into the world of psychology and relationships, &quot;How Do You Compare&quot; is a joy to read.  The text examines several areas where we tend to compare ourselves with others.  Some of the areas include intelligence quotient, creativity, healthy relationships, ability as a lover, and even if how happy we are.  Included are several short tests to help you understand where you stand in each of the areas followed by an analysis of how you then compare to others in the general population.  Each section also contains the results of various research projects.  These projects answer questions like whether there is a relationship between tall stature and intelligence?  What about a relationship between racism and intelligence, or wearing glasses and intelligence?  Can music help you fall in love?  &quot;How Do You Compare&quot; is a highly recommended an interesting read.	2004-03-06

Several relationships are examined in detail starting with neurobiology and the relationship between the emotional and logical brains.  From there the author moves to the heart/brain relationship and how heart coherence affects so many parts of your emotional being.  He also examines more surprising relationships like those involved in eye movement desensitization and reprocessing techniques.  This particular technique uses rapid eye movement to quickly heal emotional problems.  Other healing techniques examined include the energy of light, the power of Qi, Omega-3 Fatty Acids and the emotional brain, love, and emotional communication.  This is a fascinating journey into the relationships between our various biological and emotional systems that shows how we have an instinctual ability to heal ourselves.

As a result the divorce rate is well over fifty percent within the first ten years of a marriage.  Although there are many reasons for this situation, one of them is basing a relationship on transient attractions.  In his book &quot;Finding Your Million Dollar Mate&quot; author Randy Pope proposes a Biblically based system for dating.<br />One of the high points of the book is his clear explanation and sound reasoning for why you should wait for the right person before engaging in sexual activity.  In a world that supports sexual activity at earlier and earlier ages teenagers often don't want to accept &quot;because it's wrong&quot; as a reason for waiting.  Randy Pope provides a positive answer for why you should wait.  This book should be considered required reading for teenagers.  &quot;Finding Your Million Dollar Mate&quot; is a highly recommended read.	2004-03-02

Don't be deceived into thinking this is one of those easy trivia books.  While there are some fairly easy questions there are also some pretty tough ones.  And of course some of the questions can be tricky as they turn on a single word so you have to read carefully to get them right.  For example, a true or false question reads, &quot;On the ark, along with a wide array of animals and birds, were Noah and his wife, their four sons and their wives.&quot;  Reading through the question quickly might tempt you to give a positive answer but the single word &quot;four&quot; makes it a false statement.  For each trivia question the author provides the answer and the Bible reference to look it up.  If you think you know your Bible well you will be in for a lot of fun as you find out how much you may not know.  &quot;Great Bible Trivia Workout&quot; is a recommended read and a lot of fun for individuals or groups.	2004-03-02

That is what this book does best - remind us that God gives us perspective, protection, purpose, and power.  The book is divided into four sections based on those four items.  Within each section there are several chapters.  The chapters are well done and contain short stories to help illustrate the points being made.  In addition, whenever there is a related Bible verse it is shared with the reader.  One of the things that make this book unique is that it is not particularly focused on getting an emotional response from the reader but is more like a reminder of God's promises and the things that separate Christians from others. This positioning as more of a logical than emotional appeal may make it better suited than most as an appropriate read and source of encouragement for men.  &quot;A Hope and a Future&quot; is a recommended read.	2004-03-02

This is not a book about learning Hebrew and Greek so that you can read either of them in a Hebrew or Greek Bible.  This is a book about understanding the Hebrew and Greek language so that you can better use and understand biblical language tools.  For each language it goes over the alphabet, parts and types of speech, pronunciation, and similar items.  Then, using your understanding of the word forms and the like, you can turn to a concordance, biblical Greek dictionary, lexicon or similar reference and understand the importance of how a particular ending on a verb changes it and changes the meaning of a whole sentence.  If you are intimidated by the daunting task of learning another language like Greek or Hebrew then this is the book that will free you to at least learn about the language and its structure so you can use other tools more effectively for Bible study.  &quot;Do It Yourself Hebrew and Greek&quot; is a recommended book for any Bible students who just can't quite bring themselves to learn another language.	2004-03-02

These six stages are 1) accept the need for change, 2) aim squarely at the future, 3) anticipate your adversaries and allies, 4) advance the plan with courage and tenacity, 5) adjust course as you listen and learn, and 6) align your team as you stay the course of change.  The things that make this book unique among the plethora of books on change are the fun and insightful comparisons between change and a slinky.  These comparisons make it easier to remember the important principles so you can apply them in real life.  Some of the observations include the fact that someone has to launch a slinky on its way, once started the course is unpredictable, it routinely gets stuck halfway down the stairs and has to be relaunched, and it rarely lands where you predict.<br />While the book contains a lot of useful information for those seeking to accept and deal with change, it is not without a shortcoming.  The author uses a lot of side comments that often get into the way of the flow of the book.  A short example will illustrate the problem.  From the very beginning of the book:<br />&quot;Go ahead, Pick up a Slinky.  No, not the newfangled plastic models.  I'm talking about the good ol' metal kind, circa 1964.  If you don't have one handy, then go ahead - you have my permission - put down the book (you just started chapter 1, so it won't be hard to find your place) and buy one.<br />And No, I'm not getting kickbacks from the makers of Slinky.  Nor am I an employee, or even a shareholder.  (Although, now that I think of it ... maybe I'll take a break of my own, and call my stockbroker.)&quot;<br />This should have stopped at least by &quot;1964&quot;.  The book is littered with this stuff that just gets in the way of the otherwise excellent treatment of change.  However, if you continue reading through all these choppy breaks in the flow of the book you will find it well worth your time, as it is basically an excellent book with a lot of value to those who persevere.th your time, as it is basically an excellent book with a lot of value to those who persevere.	2004-02-26

That is what you get with &quot;A Brief History of Disease, Science &amp; Medicine&quot;.  Not only do you read about the great advances in medicine but also about the mistakes that were made along the way.  Although the book was written with the first year medical student in mind it is easy enough to read and understand by those with only a passing knowledge of basic first aid.  Perhaps one sentence from the Forward best describes the writing style - &quot;...it has been written to be read, rather than studied.&quot;<br />Dr. Kennedy states that this book was not widely accepted by the academic presses and so was published independently.  It is fairly obvious that one of the reasons this might be the case is his candid examination of the history of medicine.  In an age when most practitioners of the medical profession seem to feel that they have perfect knowledge, Dr. Kennedy's book shows that they have often been wrong with tragic results.  Take for instance the case of Ignaz Semmelweiss who worked in a hospital where there was a twenty-nine percent mortality rate for women giving birth.  Through experimentation and deduction he came to believe that washing your hands between patients and after autopsies would cause this rate to drop.  He ordered that hand washing would be done between patients and the rate of death dropped drastically.  However, since he had not reason why it worked it was resisted, he eventually resigned (other historians have noted that he was forced to resign) and the doctors returned to their old habits and the old mortality rate.  After all it made no sense to them that something they could not see could make any difference.  Many people will immediately see the similarities between things like this and modern attitude of medical science as related to alternative therapies - if we don't yet understand how it works then it must not work.  Most medical history texts are severely sanitized to keep such historical errors out.  So, it is really no surprise that this book, which portrays history as it was, from many primary sources, is not the most popular one among the medical establishment.<br />Personally, I enjoyed the book but I am one of those who enjoys history from a viewpoint of accuracy - warts and all.  Still you should be prepared to have some of your history that you learned in high school discredited.  I remember learning that Louis Pasteur invented innoculations to prevent disease in the later 1800's, but the fact is that Charles Maitland and others were doing it in the 1700's.  &quot;A Brief History of Disease, Science and Medicine&quot; is a recommended read for anyone interested in the history and progression of medicine.e don't yet understand how it works then it must not work.

Some of the features that put it into this category include an excellent overview of the prevailing cultural and political situation as well as historical factors affecting the text, as well as a detailed examination of how the text applies to the reader today.  I particularly liked the fact that John MacArthur does an excellent job of providing material that is instructive and interesting for the serious Bible student while still written in a way that the average person can still understand.  This is a very difficult tightrope to walk effectively and MacArthur does it brilliantly.  The main portion of the commentary examines the book of Second Corinthians pretty much verse by verse.  When appropriate he may take a more overall viewpoint as he delves into a theological truth that applies and at other times he may delve even deeper into an examination of a single pivotal word.  This ability to get to the detail without losing the overall picture makes it a remarkable book.<br />Second Corinthians is one of the more interesting books and yet one of the least studied ones in the New Testament.  It stands strong as a testament to our current world situation.  Corinth was an area of great political power, a growing economy, and great commercial power.  It stood strong as a beacon to others to come there and try to get their share of the bountiful riches of Corinth.  However, with all of this came loose morals, false teachers, and others that would undermine the society.  Does all of this sound familiar?  It should.  A study of the problems of Corinth and Paul's response to them is a study of America today.  The &quot;MacArthur New Testament Commentary: 2 Corinthians&quot; is a study of dealing with a problematic church and is a highly recommended read.	2004-02-25

In summary the author's suggested technique is to look at the person in the same way that you would a stereogram.  By focusing not on the person but on a point about eighteen inches past them you will see a faint aura surrounding the person.  This does work but the technique brings on some questions.  The reason a stereogram works is because it causes a mild cross-eyed effect.  Since this same technique is used here I thought that I would see if it created an aura around other things besides people.  Sure enough, I was able to see an &quot;aura&quot; around books, boxes, bricks, and just about anything else that I looked at this way.  So, my first impression was that this is not a credible way to see an aura but just the normal result of crossing your eyes.  On the other hand, I tried it several times and did find that I started to see tinges of various colors around people that were not there around inanimate objects.  All inanimate objects continued to just have the gray &quot;aura&quot;.  The effects of crossing your eyes should not cause colors to appear that are not there in the object.  So, maybe there is something to this after all.<br />The book is well written and easy to understand.  The instructions are explained well enough that it is easy to follow the suggested process.  The author details clearly what to expect and how to interpret various results.  He also covers chakras, common auras for various occupations, how the various colors should be interpreted, etc.  All in all this is an interesting book on auras and deserves a recommended read status for those who are interested in the subject.	2004-02-15

The main reason is because it is the only one that is entirely conceptual in nature.  No matter what you do you cannot touch a two.  You cannot create an experiment to watch two plus three create a five.  Mathematics is all concepts and symbols.  On the other hand anything in the physical world can be described using mathematical models.  Author Steven Pither takes this one step further by postulating that not only things of the physical world but also things of the spiritual world can be described using the symbology of numbers.<br />&quot;The Complete Book of Numbers&quot; first examines relationships between numbers and mathematical principles.  With an in-depth discussion of the Pythagorean mathematics, triangular and square numbers, the concept of correlation and even sub-atomic particles this book provides a solid foundation for those who would examine the relationship between number symbols and reality.  It is not until the fourth chapter that the book really starts into what most would consider standard numerology.  But, even then it delves way beyond the single number numerology most often described in basic numerology books.  &quot;The Complete Book of Numbers&quot; provides a much more substantial view of numerology than most other books on the market today and so is a recommended read for anyone interested in the subject.	2004-02-15

One thing that I learned in my childhood is if you are going to make a bold claim you had better be able to back it up because someone will call you on it.  Then again you can get away with making a claim like that when you can back it up and Doug Stevenson does exactly that.  If you've done much public speaking at all you know that it is easy to tell if you have an audience eating out of your hand or if you are losing them.  The problem is finding a way to consistently keep your audience interested.<br />This is the same problem that has been around forever in the theater industry.  How do you get your audience involved in the story?  Well, actually that is the answer.  People get involved in stories.  Lists of numbers are useless unless they can be converted to an illustration that points out their effect.  Using his &quot;Story Theater Method&quot; as the base on which to build, Stevenson takes the reader on a trip into the world of preparing powerful, effective presentations that lead people to action.  Stories involve the audience and once it is involved the audience will pay attention.  When the audience pays attention they remember the phrases you use and your &quot;phrase that pays&quot; has the effect you desire.<br />I had the opportunity over the last few weeks to try a presentation to various groups.  So, I tried to redo part of it using the techniques in the book.  The bottom line was that a great deal more of the people remembered much more of the presentation in the group where the techniques were used.  They also asked more and better questions because they had been listening throughout the presentation.<br />&quot;Never Be Boring Again&quot; deserves the highest recommendation that I can give and should be required reading for anyone who is not a hermit because we are always speaking to an audience, even if it is just one person.	2004-02-11

Before the several years prior to 9-11 people were losing interest in religion at an increasing rate.  However, the calamity of that day brought many back seeking answers and seeking God.<br />But something is very different with Christianity since the Twin Towers attacks.  With the Islamic extremists claiming responsibility many have balked at the idea of Jesus as the one and only way to heaven.  Instead everywhere we turn everyone is singing the same refrain that we all worship the same God but in different ways.  Joseph Stowell uses several Bible verses to point out that this is not consistent with traditional Christianity and flies in direct contradiction with what the Bible has to say about Jesus.<br />&quot;The Trouble with Jesus&quot; is a book that conservative Christians will enjoy and find motivating.  Among liberals some will find it encouraging and others will find it a fine example of the trouble with Jesus.	2004-01-29

Mr. Gerstner joined IBM at a critical time when sales were slumping and the behemoth of a company was laying people off almost every quarter.  What they needed was someone who could turn the company around and take it to new heights.  What they had was a complex bureaucracy that allowed little change and tended to support the continued decline of the company.  Of course we all know now that Mr. Gerstner was able to change IBM and produce a viable thriving company able to compete in the world markets once again.  This is the story of what happened from Louis Gerstner's own hand.<br />Mr. Gerstner provides insight into his viewpoint of what was happening in the company and his own fears and concerns from before the day he was named CEO until his retirement in 2002.  If you want to know what was happening at the top and what he was thinking as he went along, you will want to read this book.  If you read and liked Lee Iococca's book on his turnaround of Chrysler you will find this book similar and also very interesting in its own right.

First you have to understand the Rhonda Ghent is a character in a young adult mystery titled &quot;Plight of the Children&quot;.  So, since the book is supposedly from her it is focused on easier recipes, cooking, and activities for adolescents.  The information in the book is most appropriate for what we used to call &quot;Cadillac camping&quot;, or camping where you have a cooler, multiple pots and pans, etc.  It does not contain information or recipes of value to the backpacker or true wilderness camper.  That having been said, it is one of the best books for the novice camper.<br />If you are going to go camping with the family for the first time in a State Park or commercial campground or some similar situation you will find this to be a very valuable book.  As a person who does do a lot of wilderness camping I appreciate the fact that it provides a lot of good tips and details that the inexperienced camper might want to know in order to have a positive experience.<br />If you have a Dutch Oven (a very versatile cooking device and recommended for this type of camping) you need to make sure you read the section on seasoning the oven.  A lot of people don't season their cast iron items and as a result ruin them after only a couple of trips.  The book contains so much more than just recipes.  It includes advice on what to take and what not to take, lots of ideas for getting children involved and helping them have an enjoyable trip, and even critically important things to be aware of when camping.  For example, make sure children do not throw logs that have poison ivy on them into the fire.  The irritating oils can become airborne and can even be breathed in to create an irritation in the lungs.<br />One of the things that I did not like was some of the advice was common twenty years ago but frowned on today.  For example, building a keyhole fire with a foot deep circular pit.  Digging a fire pit is against the rules in most parks and generally frowned upon by most campers today due to the effects it tends to have on erosion and other factors.  Here in Florida if you dig a fire pit of any kind in a State Park you can be fined and asked to leave.<br />What I did like about the book was not only the vast amount of advice for first time campers but also that that meals were typically easy to make and very age appropriate for an adolescent.  This is important because cooking over an open fire is not the same as cooking on a stove.  These recipes are pretty much foolproof and sure to make the trip a positive experience for everyone.  If you are new to camping and want to make it a family event there is a lot of experience and good advice packed into this book.fire with a foot deep circular pit.

Areas covered by the book include the media kit, the cover letter, the press release, mock interviews, author biographical information, a book sell sheet, a catalog sheet, extra sales materials, and even writing an article to achieve back door sales.  The bottom line is that you may have the best book ever published but if readers don't know it exists then they will not buy it.  That is where promotional pieces come in.  Getting the book reviewed, getting distributors to carry it, or getting independent bookstores to sell it, no matter what your marketing direction you will need a promotional piece.

Some of the unusual characters include a witty parrot named Lou and two talking chimpanzees.  The primary character is Sam who deals with the tragedy of becoming an orphan by losing his ability to speak.  But the patience and love shown by his many friends help bring him through it to where he becomes whole again.  It is a story of overcoming the things that limit us in life and providing hope where sometimes it seems there is none.<br />The only thing that I didn't like about the book is the total lack of originality when it comes to how Sam became an orphan.  The story line is that he became an orphan as a result of the World Trade Center events of September 11.  It seems it has become customary to the point of being nauseating for an author to somehow tie his story back to September 11.  The author has shown throughout the rest of the story that he can think creatively, why not here?<br />For children between approximately ten and thirteen this should prove to be an interesting story that they will probably enjoy.  &quot;Monkey Fun&quot; is a recommended read for this older pre-teen market.	2004-01-16

While not always true, that philosophy is the foundation of \\"Broke! A College Student's Guide to Getting By on Less\\".  The book consists primarily of quotes from college students who share their experience and advice.  For each subject there are multiple student quotes that are selected for their applicability to that subject, some real advice on how to handle various situations, and even selected resources.  You have to appreciate the fact that the book covers so many critical areas a college student needs to understand but does it in such a way that they are likely to actually take the advice instead of ignoring it because it came from a parent.  Some of the important areas include budgeting, prioritizing, banking, credit cards, scholarships, loans, purchasing textbooks, dining, entertainment, travel, and housing.  Although it professes to be a guide for college students trying to get by on less the book is really a valuable tool for anyone making that difficult transition from living at home to being out on their own for the first time.  \\"Broke!

You have to understand demand for your product and how it adds value to a customer.  Although the principles apply to all forms of selling including department store selling, the focus of the book is really on those who sell larger value products where there may be an extended sales cycle.  It seems that there are always a few real sales stars with any endeavor.  What makes this small percent successful at selling when none around them seem to be able to sell anything?  Author James DeSena examines this and has found that there are ten laws that a sales person must understand and use if they want to be one of these power sellers.<br />These ten immutable laws are 1) create high value, 2) decide on your market, 3) develop customer expertise in your selected market, 4) build relationships for repeat business, 5) start with a leader's perspective, 6) lead from within, 7) make it a team effort, 8) build lasting success, 9) drive toward exceptional results, and 10) manage multiple customer priorities.  Each of these laws is given its own chapter to fully develop what the law means and how to apply it in the real world.  Mr. DeSena also provides many useful examples with stories from companies such as American Express and Honeywell.<br />Although there is nothing really new in the book it does represent a summation of the best practices in customer-centric sales theory.  &quot;The 10 Immutable Laws of Power Selling&quot; is a recommended read for anyone who wants an understanding of the customer-centric approach to selling and how it provides long-term success as a sales person.	2004-01-13

Some will find &quot;Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life&quot; revealing and life changing, others will find it blasphemous, most will find it somewhere in between and an interesting read.	2004-01-13

By studying people in successful long-term committed relationships Gay and Kathlyn Hendricks have found five things in common among all of them.  The authors don't pull any punches either as they start right off with the fact that you must take responsibility for your actions.  It is only after taking responsibility for your actions that you can change them and take responsibility for your relationship.  So the first secret is to understand commitment and take responsibility for a new kind of commitment.  The remaining secrets are emotional honesty, establishing a no-blame relationship, dealing with unequal amounts of creative energy being put into the relationship, and engaging in acts of appreciation on a daily basis.<br />Each one of the secrets is examined in detail as the authors describe the problem, give examples of dialogue between couples that demonstrates the problem, and clearly define the path for moving forward.  The result is a vital growing relationship that grows stronger each year instead of waning over time.  This is not easy stuff that you can just read once, do it, and have your relationship entirely changed in a couple of hours.  It involves internal reflection and examination of your self, your motivations, and your past.  For some this will require too much work, but for anyone who is having difficulty in their relationship and really wants to make a change this is a roadmap to success.<br />&quot;Lasting Love:  The Five Secrets of Growing a Vital, Conscious Relationship&quot; is a very highly recommended read for anyone in a long-term relationship or considering one.	2004-01-13

No matter what his or her religious inclination, or lack thereof, nearly everyone in America has embraced Jesus in one form or another.  For some it is a religious understanding, for others a recognition of Him as the great teacher, for others a recognition of the political benefits of being associated with Jesus, and to still others He is the ultimate sales tool or the ultimate appeal to a higher authority in support of their particular beliefs.<br />This is a fascinating trip through American history as Prothero discusses the progressive change of the American view of Jesus from the Puritanical lawgiver to a tender, caring and effeminate Jesus, to a strong, muscular Jesus and finally to our current state where images of Him are likely to appear on a refrigerator magnet, rock music poster, or a bumper sticker.  During this trip he examines incident after incident of how this transformation slowly took place.  In addition to discussing these various changes he explains how the various societal factors of the time influenced them.<br /><br />One of the most interesting points on the relationship of Americans with Jesus is that while His popularity as a celebrity or bumper sticker continues to grow, Bible study has continued to decline.  What are the factors that have allowed the average person to so effectively separate Jesus from the religious trappings that have always been associated with Him in the past?  How have these small changes allowed us to come to a point where He is truly a celebrity figure with only minimal traits of divinity?  These are some of the questions that Stephen Prothero looks at and what makes &quot;American Jesus&quot; an interesting and highly recommended read.	2004-01-08

With a Little Independent Work, You Too Can Beat the Returns of Indexes and Mutual Fund Managers	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Great book for technically oriented stock analysis	It should be no surprise to anyone these days that over time money funds tend to track the stock indexes.  Some do better, some worse, but over time they tend to track the average.  So, how do you do better than average?  How do you beat the indexes?  Lyle Wilkinson proposes that the answer is really fairly simple.  If the stocks tend to track toward a mean then trends can be examined to see where a stock is located on its mean.  This fancy term for this is trend regression analysis.  In his book &quot;DIY Portfolio Management&quot; Mr. Wilkinson provides a great explanation of trend regression analysis - what it is, what it is not, why it makes sense, and how to do it.  For those who like statistics he builds the complete formulas and rationale, for those who don't he points out that many services provide trend analysis on their sites.  You don't have to calculate the trend regression but you do need to understand what it is and how it works if you want to use it.  This book shows how to use the information to pick a stock that is likely to rise or fall.  However, this is not the only analysis in the book.  He includes information on TRiPS, market timing, risk analysis, cycles, and even an action plan.  &quot;DIY Portfolio Management&quot; takes a very technical subject and makes it available to the layman.  Lyle Wilkinson's excellent and thorough job of explaining trend regression analysis and its use in the stock market is the primary reason &quot;DIY Portfolio Management&quot; is a highly recommended read for the technical investor looking to take control of his investments.	2004-01-08

But could have covered more items in second part	Unlike the questionable dream dictionaries that seem to be popular, Veronica Tonay takes the reader of &quot;Every Dream Interpreted&quot; on a deeper trip into dream interpretation.  The book is divided into two broad parts, the first one covers common questions and their answers and the second part covers various categories of dream symbols and their common interpretation.  The questions and answers section is a brief, but highly valuable introduction to the study of dreams.  Why are dreams important?  What are the competing theories of dream interpretation?  How do these theories compare when interpreting a specific dream?  Dr. Tonay does an excellent job of describing all of this and has a knack for doing so in clear language.  She also examines common myths and urban legends in this section.<br />The part on the common dream symbols includes subsections on the natural environment, human characters, animal kingdom, buildings and other structures.  Examples in these subsections include the interpretation of various type of weather, various landscapes, type of water, people you know, different types strangers, mythical animals, birds, etc.  Generally these are not actual interpretations but what types of things the symbol typically represents.  With this information you can then look at your dream to help determine what it means.<br />These are not deep, involved interpretations but are basic ones you can use to start to understand your dreams.  To get a deeper understanding would require many, many dreams over an extended period of time.  &quot;Every Dream Interpreted&quot; is professionally done and keeps a professional tone throughout the book.  It is based on Dr. Tonay's years of empirical research and is a recommended read for anyone interested in this field of study.	2004-01-08

There is not a quick answer to children with emotional problems, ADD, or other special needs.  Instead you have to provide the right environment to encourage the child's growth and development in positive ways.  Mr. Dubropsky has over twenty years of experience with Attention Deficit and Hyperactive Disorders and brings his holistic approach to all parents of such children.<br />The book starts off with how children with special needs are diagnosed and defined.  This section includes not only the expected ADD/HD information but also looks at other challenges such as blindness, deafness, developmentally disabled, and even the gifted or talented child.  That section is followed up with a chapter on parenting styles and learning styles.  In this chapter he provides information on the typical results of each style of parenting and discusses how to teach a child with a different learning style.  With this base of knowledge firmly established he then moves into how to deal with the special needs child.  In the remainder of the book he covers common medications, their use, misuse, and side effects, the importance of developing a partnership with the child's teachers and meeting academic requirements, and other holistic items for the child with special needs.  These include diet and nutritional factors, yoga, exercise, and breathing techniques for calming effects.<br />This is an excellent book that covers the current literature on the subject very well.  Most importantly it points out that it is not the right answer to just medicate a special child into a stupor and think that you have fulfilled your obligation as a parent.  It requires patience, understanding, and knowledge of some of the techniques presented in this book.... in other words it requires actual parenting skills, and skills can be learned if you try.  &quot;There Is No Magic&quot; is a recommended text for anyone with a child with special needs or anyone who works with them.ills, and skills can be learned if you try.  &quot;There Is No Magic&quot; is a recommended text for anyone with a child with special needs or anyone who works with them.	2003-12-31

Instead of massive discussion of theory, the book teaches by creating short, realistic vignettes and then explaining what is going on.  These vignettes are situations that are sure to  strike a responsive chord for many people.  For example, one of them reads &quot;How are you, Elise?  How am I? You really want to know?  My 401(K) statements say I have less money; the credit card company says I owe more money; I'm not having any fun; my checkbook doesn't balance; the machine ate my debit card; I didn't get to watch the videos I'm paying a late charge for; I can't find a house I can afford; and I got a bad haircut.... I'm losing it.&quot;  Author Penelope Tzougros then goes on to explain what is going on, what needs to be done or how to view the situation, and what to do.<br />The seven competencies discussed are Valuing, Paying the Bills, Losing, Leveraging, Dreaming, Growing, and Gifting.  These are not only important competencies that must be understood to achieve financial success but they are also the areas that cause the most stress in a relationship.  When two people have different value systems between money, leisure, assets, etc. things can become very stressful very quickly.  Dr. Tzougros does an excellent job of helping people to see where things are just differences in style and philosophy and where they are sound financial principles.  This is one of the best books available for the average person untrained in financial theory who just wants to get control of their finances and achieve their goals.	2003-12-31

In &quot;Shotokan Karate: Kihon-Kumite-Kata&quot; author Joachim Grupp not only goes over these in detail but also covers the history of Shotokan Karate, Karate demands and characteristics, training techniques and etiquette, and the skill grading system.  With this basis on which to build he then starts at page 37 covering the stances, sparring, and forms.  This section is well written and easy to follow along with the descriptions so that you can perform the same actions.  In addition to the writing there are sequences of photographs so you can visually see what is supposed to be happening as you go through the movements.  Joachim Grupp has done a fine job of getting just the right number of photographs into the text.  There are not so many that it makes the book excessively long and three or four pictures are used to illustrate a simple movement but there are enough pictures that you don't get lost trying to figure out how he went from one movement to the next.  This is a recommended book for anyone interested in Shotokan Karate and provides an excellent reference for anyone practicing the techniques.	2003-12-31

It includes some interesting information on an apparent link between a particular infectious agent and cancer regression after having been infected.  While it was interesting reading I tended to think of it as just another collection of questionable regressions (perhaps the patient was misdiagnosed to begin with, etc.) until I checked on the background of the author.  After realizing that he is an executive at a biotechnology industry and a director of a company that develops antibody-based cancer drugs as well as a past director of another company that produces therapeutic cancer vaccines it became obvious that he is speaking from a position of authority.  From this vantage point it suddenly became more interesting and turned out to be a very good read for anyone who is interested in spontaneous regression in cancer cases.	2003-12-31

Among these the &quot;Linux+ Guide to Linux Certification&quot; is one of the best.  If you are a complete novice to Linux this is one of only two books that I could recommend.  The primary reason that it is ranked as one of the best is because it starts from the absolute beginning and explains things in easy to understand terms.  It includes a copy of RedHat Linux that can be installed so you can work through the lab exercises in the book on a real system if you have an extra computer available.  This has the added advantage of giving the reader experience with one of the most popular distributions of Linux.  Some of the other guides provide copies of Mandrake, Suse, Slackware or other distributions of Linux.  I would prefer to learn on the same distribution that I would be most likely to be working with in the real world.  This is not a real big problem for the exam because it deals primarily with text based administration and that is pretty much the same for all distributions.  It is with the graphical interfaces that there can be a significant difference between them.<br />This particular study guide is very strong on Linux installation, administration, X-Windows, networking, and most of the major areas where you really need to know what you are doing in order to pass the exam or work with a real world Linux system.  On the other hand it is a little weak on the hardware side.  While most people, including myself, feel that the book covers hardware sufficiently for learning Linux and using Linux in the real world, it is a Linux+ certification guide and so should cover hardware in the same detail required for the exam.  The exam may include questions like showing four different interfaces and asking the test-taker to identify which one is a SCSI3 interface.  This is not covered in that level of detail in the book.  In my opinion that sort of question belongs on a hardware exam and not in a Linux+ exam, but the fact of the matter is that sort of question is on the exam and so should be covered in any exam preparation book.  If this were a guide to learning and using Linux I would not treat this as a problem at all.<br />When comparing the book to other Linux+ study guides I consider it to be one of the top choices.  The other recommended guide (from Sybex) doesn't do any better of a job in dealing with the hardware problem.  This is a problem consistent throughout all the study guide books.  It does use RedHat and include a copy, which is a positive point.  And finally, it has one of the best indexes of all the Linux+ study guides.  This can be very important if you don't pass the exam the first time and need to study some specific areas.  If you are looking for a keyword that you were unsure about on the exam then you need to be able to look it up.  For example, when I took the exam there were some basic questions on Squid and iptables.  All you really needed to know was that Squid is a proxy server and iptables is related to firewall services.  This is the only book I've reviewed that actually had entries in the index for Squid and iptables.  The others had the information but no index entry and so no knowledge of where to look for the information.  There is really no excuse for a poor index in any book that seeks to help the reader become certified and this is the one with the best index.  If you want to pass the exam on the first try you should add a hardware book like one of the certification guides for the CompTIA A+ hardware exam.  &quot;Linux+ Guide to Linux Certification&quot; is a recommended purchase for people new to Linux seeking to learn the system and pass the exam.ion belongs on a hardware exam and not in a Linux+ exam, but the fact of the matter is that sort of question is on the exam and so should be covered in any exam preparation book.

From there the adventure really begins and things get pretty scary at times.<br />This is a fun adventure that juvenile readers are likely to enjoy, however, there is one thing that should be pointed out before purchasing the book.  Well into the plot, after the boys become legitimately scared, the tone of the story changes as one of the boys evangelizes the other in their moment of fear and eventually leads the other boy to Christ.  This is so blatant that it is likely to polarize groups of people who read the book.  Many Christians will purchase the book in part just because of this section and because it opens opportunities to talk about such things with their children.  Others who are not Christians or are of other religious persuasions are likely to reject the book in its entirety.  Still others will not care one way or the other.  As a reader you have to decide for yourself how you feel about a story that contains a section that is basically a religious tract.  Even with this caveat &quot;Terror at Wolf Lake&quot; is a recommended read due to the clear, easy reading style and fairly strong plot line that juvenile adventure readers are likely to enjoy.	2003-12-30

There are a lot of places on the Internet where you can get information on Disney World tickets, attractions, hours, and other information.  The problem is that you have to go all over the net to get the information.  Just this last year I went to Disney World and had to go to three different sites to get information about the hours of operation, ticket prices, places to get discount prices, and other basic information.  In &quot;The Luxury Guide to Walt Disney World&quot; author Cara Goldsbury has done all the research and put together a complete guide in a single book.<br />This is by far the most complete book on Walt Disney World that I have ever read.  Not only does she cover the usual information on standard ticket prices, hours of operation, and the various attractions, but also ranks the hotel accommodations by price, descriptions, and offerings.  She covers the discounts available, reservations information, categorizes the accommodations by what you are looking for (like best pool access, best park access, most romantic, etc.), and provides information on the menus and operating hours of the various restaurants.  For each theme park she provides maps, fastpass offerings, special activities for people staying at the resorts, gift shops, suggested itineraries for different age levels, special tours and packages, and even when to go for the shortest lines.<br />As a resident of Florida I can attest that Walt Disney World can be a wonderful and exciting adventure or an absolute nightmare that will make you swear you will never return.  The difference between the two experiences is planning ahead and knowing what to expect.  This guide does an excellent job of giving the reader all the information they need to ensure that their trip is one to remember fondly and is a highly recommended read for anyone planning a trip to any portion of Walt Disney World.ip to any portion of Walt Disney World.	2003-12-30

857103:US	43546353	R1NHHHGZTVOZQV	1929976232	812027818	Plastic Gods: A Rich Coleman Novel (Rich Coleman Novels)	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Very talented writer, poor editing	&quot;Plastic Gods&quot; is a suspense packed thrill ride through the worlds of power politics, the legal system, and finance.  This is easily one of the most exciting fiction novels of the year.  When Matt Coleman starts his bankruptcy legal practice his wife Lynn comes up with a fantastic marketing plan - convince people that the credit card companies are manipulating them into a permanent state of financial slavery.  Since their financial distress is a result of these practices there is no shame involved in filing a bankruptcy to get out of their grip and become a free person.  As a result of this plan business booms and bankruptcy filings climb.  Of course several banks that are involved in predatory credit card practices are severely hurt.  The problem is that these are very powerful people and they do not want his success to continue, nor do they want other lawyers copying his success in other parts of the country.  The head Midsouth Bank is desperate to stop Matt at any cost and the story really takes off from there.<br />This is a very well written book that draws the reader into the storyline and doesn't let them go until the very end.  I had to read the entire book at one setting to see how Matt would resolve his problems.  Author William Manchee does an excellent job of keeping the reader guessing and makes the book one surprise after another.  While his excellent writing style and use of plot twists and turns make this one of the most exciting fiction novels of the year, I don't rate it as one of the best.  The reason is simple.  While William Manchee is an excellent writer and I look forward to many more great novels tantalizing plot lines from him, the quality of the editing makes him come across as more of a hack writer.  There are multiple sentences where a complete word is just plain missing, wrong words are used (such as &quot;there&quot; instead of &quot;their&quot;), and multiple other problems.  As you near the end of the book and suspense is building, the problems become more and more common.  This completely breaks up the flow of the novel and breaks the suspense that he is so masterful at creating because you have to stop and play fill-in-the-blank.  I looked to make sure I did not have an uncorrected proof, but alas I did not.  An excellent story, masterfully done, and recommended for those who like a good suspense story, it falls back into the category of mediocre only because of bad editing.  Mr. Manchee has the potential to break out of the pack and become a well-known name in suspense novels, but only with better editing.uilding, the problems become more and more common.

She takes the view that while there are many learned behaviors that change over time and the personality itself may change over time, there are basic innate abilities that do not change.  The Kolbe system examines methods of problem solving that she considers instinctual and therefore unchanging.  Each one of these methods is not better or worse than another but are just the ones that a particular person may use.  Once you know the methods that various people use you can ensure that you have the right mix of people when pursuing creative problem solving.  Group interaction and problem solving is not the only use for the Kolbe Index.  Once you know your innate abilities and problem solving methods you can pinpoint your strengths and weaknesses.  From this information you can determine the best profession for you to enter and other important life decisions.  The Kolbe System is gaining momentum as an accurate method of forecasting how people will react under various circumstances and becoming more popular as a psychological evaluation tool.  &quot;Powered by Instinct&quot; brings the basic tenets of this system to the average reader from the original developer of the system.  &quot;Powered by Instinct&quot; is a recommended read.	2003-12-22

After witnessing his family killed by malicious children he becomes afraid of people.  Unfortunately, as it turns out his purpose has something to do with people and this fear almost keeps him from following through on his calling.  This is a tale of overcoming fear, of reaching for your goals despite obstacles, of finding where you belong, of healing your life.  &quot;The Raven Who Spoke With God&quot; is a lighthearted and fun read that also teaches very important moral and life skills.<br />When the author contacted me about possibly reviewing this book I ignored his e-mail.  He sent a second request a few days later and I read the synopsis but still decided that it did not interest me and did not respond.  Finally he sent a copy anyway.  I could not be happier that he did.  Many people try to write symbolic short stories that teach deeper lessons much like an elongated parable.  Most fall sadly short of that goal; Christopher Foster does not.  &quot;The Raven Who Spoke with God&quot; is a highly recommended read and it would have been my loss if I had missed it.	2003-12-22

One of the things that I like best about their books is that they are one of the few publishers who provide both the information needed to pass the exam and the information needed to actually work in the real world.  Generally my experience has been that there are good books that provide practical knowledge and good books that provide the information to pass the certification exams.  But there are very few that provide the information to do both.<br />All the common networking and administrative tasks are covered in detail including installation methods and problems, security, file services, and troubleshooting.  The author does an excellent job of walking the reader through all the various processes step by step and explaining each item in detail including little quirks to be careful of.  In addition each chapter ends with a chapter summary, as section on exam essentials that summarize exam critical items, a summary of commands covered in the chapter, a key terms list, and review questions and answers.  The book even includes a CD with a test engine, two exam preparation exams, and flashcards.  I've taught Linux at the college level both for certification and for practical application purposes and this is one of the best books available for the new or only minimally experienced Linux user who is seeking to pass the certification exam.<br />Although I do consider this one of the best certification exam books on the market I do have a few items that I did not like.  First, the graphical installation instructions in the book are for the Mandrake distribution of Linux.  This is not a problem for exam preparation and since that is the purpose of the book it is really not a problem.  However, in the real world, at least here in Florida, RedHat is a much more common distribution and I would have preferred to see the screen shots reflect a RedHat distribution than Mandrake.  The graphical installation method is the only place where this makes any difference of consequence and even the novice can figure it out with a little patience and thought.  The second item is that the index is rather skimpy given the amount of material in the book and all the items covered.  All the major items are in the index but many of the important minor items are not.  For example, if you wanted to know what ipchains is about or iptables then you would not find them in the index at all.  For purposes of the certification exam the main thing you need to know about them is that they are related to setting up a firewall.  Well, there is an entry in the index for firewall but not for ipchains or iptables.  If you knew to look up firewalls to know about ipchains then you would have gotten the question right and would not need the entry in the index.  If you missed it and wanted to know what they are you are out of luck.  Finally, it does not cover hardware well enough to pass the exam.  While this is a shortcoming of this book, I have not found any other Linux+ study guides that do any better of a job, this is a problem with all of them.<br />Even with the small index shortcoming, the &quot;Linux+ Study Guide&quot; is still one of the best sources for learning what you need to know to pass the certification exam.  Since all the guides are too shallow on hardware, the only factor that keeps this one from being the best of the best in this category is the skimpy index.RedHat distribution than Mandrake.

Author Paula Huston has been here with all the rest of us, but she has found, through her personal experiences, that you can move to a simpler, holier life without moving to a monastery and completely eschewing the modern world.  Paula invites us to travel with her along her journey as she shares her experiences successes and shortcomings.  She models her philosophy on some of the most prominent saints of the early Christian church including some of my favorites, St. Francis of Assisi, St. Ignatius, and St. Benedict.  As she turned to these people she tried to practice the things that allowed them their holy walk with God.  Some of the things she discusses include the need for and ability to obtain solitude, silence, asceticism, meditation and other practices of a simple life.  Although she does not word it that way, it becomes obvious that part of what she is talking about is the ability to break free from the things that enslave us and keep us in such a state that we can't even keep our minds quiet for all the thoughts and worries that invade it.<br />Choosing to lead a simpler life so you can have a more peaceful, more holy life, may sound like an extreme sacrifice, but what is the price that you put on internal peace?  Standing on the other side after having made these changes Paula finds it hard to understand why anyone would not do the same.  Paula Huston is a role model for those who want to simplify their lives and clearly demonstrates that this path is available to anyone who wants to travel it.  &quot;The Holy Way&quot; is a highly recommended book for any audience.	2003-12-15

So it was with great interest that I picked up &quot;The Craft of Argumentation with Readings&quot;.  I expected a lot of the usual stuff, an almost mechanical approach to logic and influence.  This is not at all what I received.  This book is unique among this genre of books.  The authors very clearly take the reader into the area of argumentation and influence as an art form.<br />All the expected education in argumentation is presented in the book.  Reasoning, evidence, claims, forms of reasoning, meanings, causes, overt and covert force of language, fallacies, etc. are all covered.  But all these things are in any competent book on argumentation.  The problem is that most books also end there - a competent education in the mechanics of argumentation.  This book not only develops those competencies but also closely examines issues such as developing the ethos, credibility, and other factors of argumentation.  This is where this book pulls away from the pack and becomes one of the very few that teaches the art and craft of argumentation.  You might see the difference by comparing it to the art of dance.  Anyone can learn the movements required to perform a specific dance and may be able to execute it flawlessly, but it doesn't necessarily move the audience emotionally.  Another trained dancer can go through the same steps and create a thing of beauty that moves the audience and causes them to feel they are a part of the dance.  Likewise you can go through the mechanics of argumentation and develop a perfectly logical and compelling position that moves no one to accept it.  Or you can create it as an art form that creates an emotional as well as a logical response in the recipient.  This is not only a highly recommended book for anyone interested in the subject, it should be required reading for anyone serious about understanding argumentation and influence.	2003-12-15

Each recipe has a picture of the completed dish as well as complete instructions for its preparation.  Many of the dishes may require a trip to the local Chinese grocery as some ingredients may not be readily available in your neighborhood store.  This is not just another cookbook of common recipes for dishes you are likely to find in the local Chinese buffet.  This is a book with recipes like Shandong Chicken and Mushrooms, Braised Duck with Bamboo Shoots and Mushrooms, or Honey Glazed Beef and Walnuts.<br />In addition to the recipes there are many pictures and articles that bring the Chinese experience into your home.  Beautiful scenic pictures, as well as pictures of every day life.

Scattered throughout the book are multiple exercises to help the reader find that peace inside their self.  This peace translates into a stronger personal aura and a strong sense of presence.<br />One of the most important points of the book besides establishing this internal peace is to approach each sales opportunity from a fresh viewpoint with no preconceptions.  This allows an honest relationship to develop between the customer and salesperson and a true partnership.  This is selling with integrity at it's best.  &quot;Zen Wise Selling&quot; is not a sales techniques book but a book on the foundation that underlies all relationships, including sales.  The information in sales techniques books can then be applied to this foundation.  Sell more, less stress, more peace, achieve the Zen of selling.  &quot;Zen Wise Selling&quot; is a highly recommended book.	2003-12-10

Included in this social change has been the return of so many mothers to the workforce in an attempt to make ends meet.  Unfortunately, many of the social norms of the past have not adapted to these changes.  &quot;Dear Dinah&quot; author Jeannie Selley-Smith points out that household roles have been some of the slowest to change and the traditional male and female roles are in the greatest need of change.  This is nothing new, as many writers, women's groups, psychologists, and others have pointed out the inequity of the man coming home to relax after work and the woman continuing to come home only to face the chores of running the household.<br />Ms. Seeley-Smith does address basic personality types and how to use them to create more of a partnership in your marriage.  While she really addresses nothing new, her writing style is humorous and witty and makes the book a joy to read.  If you are looking for a book to help resolve the inequity of this situation there are many available, but few are both helpful and as entertaining a read as &quot;Dear Dinah&quot;.  Hopefully we will see more works from the pen of Ms. Seeley-Smith, but in an area that has been less thoroughly covered already as this one has been.	2003-12-10

These three (Psalms 2, 110, and 132) are often referred to as the royal Psalms because of their references to the king and inference that the king was the representation of Yahweh on earth.  Was this a real king?  Is it prophetic or symbolic of God? There are a lot of questions about these particular Psalms.<br />As a student of Rolf Knierim, author Randy G. Haney applies the methods of the Knierim School of Old Testament exegesis to these Psalms to try to gain a better understanding of them.  First he provides some historical background including how various people and groups have interpreted these Psalms.  Mr. Haney then shows how each of the various interpretations of them has fallen short in one way or another.  Finally, he then turns his attention to examining the words, syntax, and forms of these Psalms to decipher their deeper meaning.  He attacks the problem of how Yahweh, the king, Israel, and the other nations are their relation to each other as well as how the king's position serves as at least an earthly symbol of God.<br />This is a very detailed exegetic work that is written more in the style of a college thesis than a popular book.  Because of this it will be a more appropriate text for the seminarian level student or those with an existing background in Biblical exegesis.  &quot;Text and Concept Analysis in Royal Psalms&quot; is an excellent resource for anyone looking to expand their knowledge of the Scriptures and willing to put forth the effort to read a detailed scholarly text.	2003-12-10

Myung Soo Suh, who received his doctorate at the University of Sheffield in England, and is currently an Assistant Professor of the Old Testament at Hyupsung University, covers all the bases in this work.  He explores the purposes of the Tabernacle as a military vehicle, a social function, a community focus point, a theological function, and other functions.  The analysis starts with the exodus from Egypt and the gold and silver taken by the Israelites in their flight.  These precious metals are then used later to create both the golden calf and the tabernacle.  Unlike most other works on the Tabernacle, this one starts at the very beginning and follows all the items before the tabernacle was built that affect it.  It is a recommended read for anyone who wants to examine in great detail the Tabernacle and its place in the history of Israel.	2003-12-10

For example, I had a minor problem where I knew what the problem was and what had to be done, but could not remember the specific utility or specific steps needed.  A quick turn to the appropriate section of the book and I had my answer.  This is not a book that you would use to try to learn Linux and it does not profess to be such a book.  On the other hand if you have a familiarity with Red Hat Linux and want a refresher, or a short summary of the most common administrative tasks this is an excellent book.  If I were to take a good Linux book and write an outline so that I could just jump to the answers when I had questions this is the kind of book that I would end up with.  &quot;Red Hat Certified Engineer Exam Notes&quot; is a highly recommended read for anyone wanting a summary of Red Hat Linux in a well-organized format.	2003-12-09

For each of these types he breaks down the analysis to four types of stewards loosely based on the biblical parable of the wise steward.  The four categories of stewards in his book are the Good Steward, the Efficient Steward, the Effective Steward, and the Lazy Steward.  With this framework in mind he develops the &quot;Stewardship Model&quot;, a basic non-technical model that anyone can follow to improve their personal management of time and finances.  The bulk of the book is dedicated to money, debt, savings, and investments.  In this section you will find no complex money theories or advanced economics, just simple straightforward basic financial advice.  This is the kind of stuff that everyone should have been taught in school, but with a decidedly Christian slant.  &quot;The Stewardship Model&quot; is a recommended read.	2003-12-09

Totally different flavors, totally different cookies, same basic recipe; it's amazing the variety of cookies a good baker can create with simple additions from a single recipe. Now with Lia Wilson's book you too can create almost any kind of cookie from this same basic recipe.<br />Part II - The Cookie Cutter Cookbook.<br />This section contains fifteen pages of recipes that are designed to work well with traditional cookie cutters.  There are various recipes and decoration suggestions.  The recipes include some unusual chocolate cookie recipes as well as traditional sugar cookies, gingerbread man, and other recipes.<br />Part III - Gifts for the Cookie Jar: Cookie Recipes for Ingredients in a Jar.<br />When you have an urge for cookies the easiest way to satisfy it is to grab a pack at the store. Of course, they taste better if you get a roll of cookie dough and bake them. Then again they taste even better if you get all the ingredients and actually make them from scratch, but who has time for that? Wouldn't it be great if you could just grab a box or jar with all the dry ingredients already measured so all you had to do is pour it into a bowl, add the egg and butter, mix and bake? &quot;Gifts for the Cookie Jar&quot; is a collection of cookie recipes that are appropriate for just this sort of gift. Each recipe has complete instructions for the correct measurement of the ingredients, the size of the jar needed and an appropriate layering order so you end up with an attractive and unique gift. After layering the ingredients into the jar, you add a decorative lid, and a small tag with the baking instructions (tags with the instructions are included in the book). Decorative and yet practical, all the gift recipient has to do is take the lid off, pour the ingredients into a mixing bowl, add the appropriate egg, butter, vanilla, or other perishable ingredient, mix and bake. Quick, easy, no searching for the recipe, no searching for ingredients, no quick trip to the store for a forgotten ingredient, and delicious homemade cookies; it's the perfect gift to give or keep available for yourself for that day when you want fresh cookies without the hassle.<br />Recipes include oatmeal-raisin cookies, orange sugar cookies, date and walnut cookies, malted milk crunchies, butterscotch snaps, toffee chocolate chippers, and butter pecan delights. These are really good recipes and an absolutely delightful idea.<br />With both of her best cookie books in a single volume plus the added section on cookie cutter recipes this volume is very convenient to use.Each of the two books reviewed before had received a &quot;highly recommended&quot; rating on their own.  Now together in one book the only rating I can possibly give it is very highly recommended for anyone who enjoys cookies as a treat or as a gift.Each of the two books reviewed before had received a &quot;highly recommended&quot; rating on their own.

The recipes are based on the way things were prepared during the early 1800s and include some very good dishes like lemon meringue pie and pan-fried potatoes and some much less common recipes that might include ingredients like a pound of buffalo meat.<br />Along with these recipes the book contains various pieces of information from the trip journals.  The additional information includes provisions lists such as the one from Philadelphia where they purchased 176 lbs of gunpowder and 193 lbs of &quot;P. Soup&quot;.  A &quot;P. Soup&quot; follows and it takes only a cursory reading to figure out that this is basically the precursor to bouillon cubes.  Throughout the book there are small quotes from the journals that indicate what they were doing at the time and also several passages that give general information about the trip.<br />This is a book that will prove interesting to anyone interested in the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition or recipes of the time.  &quot;The Food Journals of Lewis &amp; Clark&quot; is a recommended read for any audience interested in American History and covers an area generally overlooked in other Lewis &amp; Clark works.	2003-11-18

It doesn't matter if they are not the most important part of the scene - they still command the audience's attention even when in the background.  These people have a sense of presence; their very being and bearing demands respect.  That ability to command respect is what this book is about.  How does a real leader create this sense of presence such that he or she automatically has the attention and respect of those they lead?<br />The authors define presence as &quot;the ability to connect authentically with the thoughts and feelings of others&quot;.  While business has generally ignored this sense of presence and assumed that people will be led simply because they are employees, the acting profession lives or dies by this sense of presence.  Business is now struggling to create loyal employees who think for theirselves and have a sense of being a part of a larger community.  Business is looking for great leaders.<br />To help find or create these great leaders there has been a plethora of books about the attributes of great leaders; they communicate well, they treat others as important, etc.  The difference between most management or leadership books and this one can best be illustrated by the art of dance.  A good dancer can be mechanically perfect. Every twist, every turn, every leap is exactly as it should be, but still the dance is boring.  On the other hand a dancer who truly feels and moves to the music as it were a part of their self creates a thing of beauty to see.  That is where this book differentiates itself from the other books on leadership.  The others are typically descriptions of what makes good leaders - the mechanics of the perfect dance.  This book helps the leader to establish a sense of presence that in turn causes a sense of immediate respect in others - the dancer who feels the music.<br />At the end of each chapter are exercises to help the reader to learn to apply the lessons.  The authors fill a deep chasm in management theory with this book.  &quot;Leadership Presence: Dramatic Techniques to Reach Out, Motivate and Inspire&quot; is a highly recommended read and required reading for those in leadership positions of any kind.he reader to learn to apply the lessons.

Kennedy was assassinated there has been no shortage of conspiracy theories.  Most take one or two minor pieces of evidence and build it into a full-blown theory.  Rarely has someone with inside information come forward with a detailed theory.  Barr McClellan has had that access to inside information as a member of the legal firm of Edward A. Clark that represented Lyndon B. Johnson's private as well as public needs.  Being privy to this information and having access to individuals who were charged with protecting the president as well as promoting his agenda has lead him to the conclusion that when you follow all the details, ultimately L.B.J. and his lust for power are what lead to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.<br />Perhaps the most fascinating part of McClellan's book is his insight into the real Lyndon B. Johnson and his associates.  McClellan provides a thorough background and history of Johnson from his early years through his presidency.  The evidence presented is not conclusive, however it does provide enough of a convincing argument to show that it is not only a possibility, but totally consistent with the personalities, histories, and desires of the people involved.  &quot;Blood, Money &amp; Power&quot; is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in the John F. Kennedy assassination.	2003-11-17

In fact there were many major differences between the early churches.  Some believed that Christ was entirely human and not divine at all.  Others believed he was entirely divine and not human at all.  And, of course, there were a wide variety of beliefs between those extremes.  This is just one of the examples of how widely apart the early Christian church was in terms of theology, soteriology, and even the purpose of the church in the world.<br />There were also many different &quot;scriptures&quot; supposedly written by the apostles or those who were in direct contact with the apostles.  Some of these are patently forgeries; others are hard to tell.  What were these writings?  What was their significance?  Did any of the early churches treat them as part of their canon of sacred scriptures?  If they did then why were they not included in the current canon of the New Testament?  How did these affect the beliefs of the early church or how did the beliefs of the early church affect how these were written?<br />Bart D. Ehrman takes on all of these questions through his riveting account of the &quot;Lost Christianities&quot;, the beliefs and scriptures of the various early Christian churches.  This is a very readable and well-organized treatise that is sure to become a commonly referred book for anyone interested in this historical aspect of the Christian Church.  &quot;Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew&quot; is a highly recommended read.	2003-11-17

The basic premise of the book is that as long as we define others by putting them into a predefined mold based on their beliefs, age, education, or other traits, we will always find that they don't fit.  Why is that the case?  It's because we determine what is &quot;normal&quot; for people of that age, belief, lifestyle, or whatever and then find that nobody is &quot;normal&quot;.  As long as we define unique individuals as non-unique beings we will always be disappointed and end up in confrontations or disillusionment.  This is a book about doing the opposite.  It is about building relationship and community by accepting people for who and what they are - complete with any and all flaws.<br />Ortberg's writing style makes his works a delight to read.  While creating an entertaining read he still manages to make his point very effectively.  You finish the book with a deep appreciation for others and a strong commitment to building a positive community among your friends, family, and others.  And, of course, that includes building the same strong relationship with God, who does accept us just the way we are with all of our faults.  Just as God accepts us as we are, we need to accept others as they are.  This is the foundational premise for building a positive community relationship with others.  &quot;Everybody's Normal Till You Get to Know Them&quot; should be required reading for everyone and deserves the highest recommendation that I can offer.	2003-11-17

The first is that you have to look beyond the outward appearances of a person to see their true value as a person.  The second lesson is that people often act the way we expect them to act.  If we change the way we treat them they generally change the way they treat us.  The story itself is set in Scotland where the young boy Rabbie has a special skill carving wood.  As he travels he finds a village with a problem giant that terrorizes the village and steals their food.  Rabbie teaches the villagers to see beyond the outward appearances of the giant and find the good giant inside.  The book opens up a wealth of opportunities to discuss how our actions affect others, looking beyond the obvious, and cultural differences.  The illustrations are colorful and hold a child's attention well.  &quot;The Giant King&quot; is a highly recommended read for all children.	2003-11-08

From common crimes like pickpockets, thieves, muggers, and robbers to terrorists, kidnappers, and even murderers, the travel climate has changed drastically.<br />What can you do about it?  The best thing you can do is be as informed and prepared as possible.  That way you can avoid as many difficult situations as possible.  \\"The Personal Travel Safety Manual\\" comes to the rescue of the concerned traveler with a concise primer on everything you need to know.  Some of the suggested information includes the obvious such as learning about the background, geography, politics and people of the country, checking with the State Department about travel advisories, and learning the relevant laws.  Others are just as important, if not more so, but are easily missed.  For example, medical preparations, making flights as non-stop as possible, and selecting a secure hotel.  The author goes into detail on how to select a secure hotel, things you can do to make yourself appear to be less of a prime target, what to do at home before you leave, how to deal with communications, how to think defensively, dealing with banks, secure vehicles, trains, buses, laptop computers, special concerns for women, and traveling with children.<br />The final section of the book covers what you can do when things do go wrong.  It includes what to do in the event of sickness or injury, if you are arrested, or if you have a traffic accident.  The author also covers much more severe situations such as kidnapping or hijacking.  Finally, the appendices include suggested items in a first aid kit, duplicate copies of documents that should be kept at home in case yours are lost or stolen, a thorough pre-travel checklist, and other miscellaneous items.<br />Given the current international political situation and the normal dangers of international travel this book should be in the hands of anyone planning a trip out of the country.  A highly recommended read for international travelers, I can't imagine planning a trip out of the country without consulting it first and following the detailed advice inside.uld be in the hands of anyone planning a trip out of the country.

I read through it, skimmed through it a second time, looked at the included CD and reviewed the questions at the end of each chapter, took the exam and passed it the first time.  That makes it pretty clear that all the information is in here to pass the exam, all you have to do is study it.  Since it made upgrading my certification a snap I would have to give it a very high recommendation to anyone seeking to do the same.	2003-10-28

Of course, they taste better if you get a roll of cookie dough and bake them.  Then again they taste even better if you get all the ingredients and actually make them from scratch, but who has time for that?  Wouldn't it be great if you could just grab a box or jar with all the dry ingredients already measured so all you had to do is pour it into a bowl, add the egg and butter, mix and bake?  &quot;Gifts for the Cookie Jar&quot; is a collection of cookie recipes that are appropriate for just this sort of gift.  Each recipe has complete instructions for the correct measurement of the ingredients, the size of the jar needed and an appropriate layering order so you end up with an attractive and unique gift.  After layering the ingredients into the jar, you add a decorative lid, and a small tag with the baking instructions (tags with the instructions are included in the book).  Decorative and yet practical, all the gift recipient has to do is take the lid off, pour the ingredients into a mixing bowl, add the appropriate egg, butter, vanilla, or other perishable ingredient, mix and bake.  Quick, easy, no searching for the recipe, no searching for ingredients, no quick trip to the store for a forgotten ingredient, and delicious homemade cookies; it's the perfect gift to give or keep available for yourself for that day when you want fresh cookies without the hassle.<br />Recipes include oatmeal-raisin cookies, orange sugar cookies, date and walnut cookies, malted milk crunchies, butterscotch snaps, toffee chocolate chippers, and butter pecan delights.  These are really good recipes and an absolutely delightful idea.  A highly recommended book, the recipes, instructions, the baking instructions tags, and the ideas for decorations make it a delight to read and create.	2003-10-28

This ability keeps the entire book tight, concise, and informative even though it is almost 500 pages.  Examining in detail both the practical and theoretical sides of marketing &quot;The Marketing Manager's Handbook&quot; is a complete marketing education and a very highly recommended read.	2003-10-27

First is a recipe for a basic cookie dough.  Master this dough and you can appear to be a cooking baking genius.  Just add a few ingredients to the already prepared dough and you have pfeffernuesse (one of my favorites), add a couple of different ingredients and you have crispy pecan thins, different ingredients and you get spicy cinnamon sugar twists, orange slices, nutty lemon rounds, pineapple pinwheels, or even chocolate peanut butter sandwich cookies.  Totally different flavors, totally different cookies, same basic recipe; it's amazing the variety of cookies a good baker can create with simple additions to a single recipe.  Now with Lia Wilson's book you too can create almost any kind of cookie from this same basic recipe.  A highly recommended read, the results are simply delicious.	2003-10-27

An exhaustive collection of Greek recipes it includes many recipes for lamb, pork, and beef as well as vegetable dishes, sauces, marinates, desserts and any other food category.  It also includes traditional Greek recipes that would be pretty hard to find in any other cookbooks.  For example, it includes traditional recipes for fish roe, grilled eel, fried brains, and squid rings.  If you have a favorite Greek dish and would like a recipe for it I would be greatly surprised if you could not find it here.  Pilafs, pastas, meats, breads (some wonderful bread recipes), appetizers, soups, desserts, drinks, it is all here including my favorites - gyros, souvlaki, and baklava.<br />At the end of the book Susie Atsaides includes a section on Greek superstitions, traditions and legends.  She has done a great job of sharing this fascinating aspect of Greek social customs and history and it is great reading for anyone who has Greek friends or is interested in their traditions.  She also has sections on holiday celebrations, different men and women in the village, and common ceremonies.  By the time I had finished the book I had a new appreciation for the Greek people and a greater understanding of their history, society, and traditions.  Susie Atsaides has opened up her life and family for all to understand and appreciate.  This is a very highly recommended read for anyone interested in Greek recipes or Greek society in general, Susie Atasaides effectively welcomes you into her life and makes you feel like a friend of the family.	2003-10-27

The Fandango is family and friends, a dance of lively rhythms.  Modern Dance represents today's world, fast, hectic, and changing.  The Tango represents the dance of love, a dance where the partners move as one.  The Flamenco is the miscellaneous stuff that makes up the bulk of our life, at times slow and pensive, at other times fast and furious. Tripping the light fantastic is the search for and relationship with God.  And finally the Charleston, the dance of aging, adjusting, accepting, and changing.<br />In each of these sections author Carmen Rutlen shares vignettes of her life and about life in general.  At times humorous, at times wise and deep, at times very general, at times very personal.  Although each one is very short lasting from just a couple of lines to a couple of pages it is hard to put it down and you find yourself involved in the dance of life with Carmen.  &quot;Dancing Naked... in Fuzzy Red Slippers&quot; is a delight to the read.	2003-10-27

Jay Lipe manages to distill some vary advanced marketing concepts into small easy to understand and easy to apply pieces that anyone can follow.  Some of the areas he covers include common mistakes and how to correct them (or avoid them entirely), how to use active language to get people to act, how to use metrics to determine what works and what does not in your marketing plan, search engine positioning, budgeting, and even how to market during a recession.<br />Mr. Lipe asks some very directed questions at strategic points in the book.  These questions are designed to make you think and help clearly define your goals as well as how you will be able to achieve them.  In addition he includes lots of forms that can be used to clearly define your target market, how you will get your marketing plan to them, exactly what your marketing plan should, and should not include, and exactly how to go about implementing the plan.  This is a complete marketing plan that can be used for any business no matter what type of services or products they provide.  If you want a marketing education that concentrates on the practical side of marketing without a lot of discussion of theory then this is a book that you will want to consider.  I've taken college level marketing courses that did not provide as much practical knowledge as this book.  &quot;The Marketing Toolkit for Growing Business&quot; is a very highly recommended purchase if you plan to take charge of your own marketing or want to know what your marketing firm should be doing.	2003-10-26

When it is a small local group with peculiar beliefs it is typically classified under &quot;ethnoreligions&quot;.  This is definitely appropriate as it would be impossible to chronicle every minor cult and sect of each religion.  However, it covers the largest number of religions of any similarly titled book that I have seen.<br />One of the things that make this series unique is the entry for each country.  Besides having an entry for each religion it has each country listed along with a short religious history of the country and statistical information about the number of adherents of the various religions.  For each religious group if there is a central address, web site, or other contact information it is listed.  Associations are also listed as well as the history of the association and membership.<br />The books are hard bound, contain copious photographs, and are of very high quality material and workmanship.  All contributors are highly regarded professors, lecturers, and officers of the various religious groups or countries.  This is another one of the items that make this set unusual, you are not getting one person's opinion of another person's beliefs but generally are getting the information directly from respected authorities within the religion or authorities on the religion.  This is a very pleasant break from the all to common books today where, for example, a Christian is trying to explain Islam and doing so from an obviously slanted perspective.  I would trust the information in this set of books to accurately portray the beliefs of the various religions in an unbiased manner more than just about any other book I have seen that professes to be a survey of various religions.<br />The final point that makes this four book set unusual is the sheer number of religions examined.  Most other books list twenty or thirty religions.  In this set there are 135 entries just for the letter A.<br />Professional, unbiased, informative, and thorough, it is the perfect set to own if you are interested in a basic understanding of the various religions of the world.  &quot;Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices&quot; is a very highly recommended read.that makes this four book set unusual is the sheer number of religions examined.

There are larger, more complete books on resumes available but if you don't have the time to wade through a four hundred page book then this is the best way to get the quick condensed version.  It includes sections on how to use &quot;action&quot; words to get the reader excited about your resume.  It details how to create the cover letter, what to do with a reference letter, the elements of a successful resume, and common mistakes.  It even includes sample letters for how to answer a classified add, samples of resume types (chronological, functional, or combination), and how to write a follow-up letter.  One of the unique items in this book is that it contains page after page of forms you can use to help organize your data and get it into an appropriate format.  The author finishes with a section on how to become your own career consultant.  While not as extensive as some of the other books on getting a job and resumes, it is much more practical than most.  Instead of providing a lot of information and no practical walk-through on preparing your resume, this book gets right to the point and contains the best practical method to actually put the resume together that I have seen.  This practical aspect of the book makes it a recommended read for anyone planning to start producing and sending resumes of any kind.	2003-10-04

The text is easy to read even for a ten or eleven year old reader and would be of great value to anyone seeking to teach their children the common stories of the Bible as related in the Gospel of Mark.  While the idea is good and I could see this book being given to young readers to start their journey into learning the Bible, there is one thing that I find annoying about the book.  The writing style itself is somewhat choppy.  It seems that the writer felt each quote had to be followed or preceded with &quot;He said&quot;, &quot;they said&quot;, &quot;it said&quot;, or something similar.  Just open the book to any page and you will find things that are redundant (i.e. page 18 &quot;'He didn't say, but I think we can find him', was the response.&quot;  Obviously it was the response since it was in answer to a question.), and full of things that break the natural flow of the material.  Even with that caveat it is still a recommended read for young or marginally literate readers.	2003-10-04

It did not come easy and there were many times it seemed like it was not to be, but Geela shares her experiences and the wisdom she gained over the years.  Geela shares her innermost turmoil as she seeks and almost gives up on her dream.  Then, after a tragic car accident she travels a different path as she gives up the pursuit of materialistic goals and acquires a new goal of seeking unity and peace.  This is a personal look inside her life and an inspirational story to others who are going through difficult times.  &quot;The American Dream&quot; is a recommended, encouraging read.	2003-10-04

He immediately reminded me of Tom Sawyer with his ability to convince the other kids that it was fun and a privilege to paint the fence.  Tom Stevens had the same gift of persuasion.  In &quot;Newspaper Caper&quot; Tom soon convinces his friends Jimmy and Matt to help him with a newspaper route and the adventure begins.<br />When cars start disappearing from the neighborhood the boys decide to keep their eyes open for anything unusual as they deliver their papers early in the morning.  Their diligence soon pays off.  Ride along with them on their adventure as the story unfolds and the suspense continues to build.  Although it is more likely to appeal to boys than girls, it is an excellent story for kids around eight to twelve years old of either sex.<br />There is one section of the story that some parents are likely to find offensive.  Near the beginning there is an incident with a vicious dog.  In dealing with the dog Matt prepares some fresh meat with jalapeno juice and Tabasco sauce and finishes it off by lacing it with laxatives.  Needless to say it makes an immediate impression on the dog and it no longer is a problem for them.  In fact, by the end of the adventure it is on a friendly basis with them.  It would be a shame for a child to miss a good story because a parent is offended by such a passage (although I can understand their being offended).  Taking the positive angle with the incident it could be used by parents to open up a discussion of cruelty to animals or whether or not the ends justifies the means in many situations.  The same passage could be used as a reason not to allow your child to read the book or used as a springboard for an important and educational discussion.  Other than that one caveat, this is a suspenseful, fast paced, story with the choice of words appropriate for pre-teen readers and a recommended read.	2003-10-04

This is a particularly great cookbook for those with little cooking experience or for someone who wants to put together a balanced, healthy, home cooked meal without a lot of fuss.  The instructions for preparation of each dish could not be easier.  If you are used to the books with three or four paragraphs of preparation instructions you will be pleasantly surprised to find that these recipes can all be completed with only three to four simple steps.<br />I tried a few recipes and found that among my favorites were Potatoes Supreme, Hawaiian Pork, and Cola Chicken.  Based on the ingredients list the Cola Chicken sounded so unlikely to taste good that I just had to try it and it turned out great.  I also liked the way that Coates broke down the main dishes into the categories of chicken, beef, pork, and seafood instead of lumping them all together under the &quot;Main Dishes&quot; category like most cookbooks do.<br />The recipes often take advantage of mixes like a box cake mix or stuffing mix in order to keep the ingredients list down to four.  But for the new cook or one who does not have a lot of time or want a lot of fuss making dinner it meets all the important requirements - quick and easy to prepare, goof-proof, minimal cleanup, and tasty.  This is a highly recommended read and especially so for the novice cook or the hurried family cook or the college bound student.	2003-10-02

Each is photographed on location so you can get an idea of how it might fit into a particular room decor.  Mimi Dietrich also includes some background and thoughts about each of the quilt designs at the beginning of the book before taking the reader off on a more detailed look at them.  The directions for each quilt are complete with patterns, directions, materials, cutting, assembly, and finishing instructions.  They often even include ideas on pillowcases to match.  After each quilt she includes a short recipe for a favorite breakfast snack or drink.<br />A couple of my favorite quilts in the book are Starry Night and Garden Comfort.  Garden Comfort is not one of the designs that I would typically think of when I conjure up thoughts of a quilt but it is absolutely beautiful.  &quot;Bed and Breakfast Quilts&quot; is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in quilting or quilt designs.	2003-10-02

From appetizers, to breads, to brunch, soups, salads, sandwiches, vegetables, side dishes, main dishes, and sweets just about any type of recipe is represented here.  This is a great cookbook for the novice cook or people in a hurry.  The recipes are so simple that even a young teenager can prepare a complete meal without any problems.<br />Some of the recipes that I really liked were the Roasted Garlic Dip, Mini Reubens, Green Olive Spread, Pineapple Teriyaki Chicken, Ranch Chicken, Sweet and Sour Spareribs, and Peanut Butter Fudge.  It was really hard to pick favorite recipes from this book because everything I tried was great.  This cookbook has already become one of my personal favorites.  It has everything that I look for - comb bound so it lies flat, easy recipes to follow, easily acquired ingredients, minimal cleanup, and very tasty.  This is a highly recommended cookbook for anyone to have around the house to prepare that elegant meal that looks and tastes like you have slaved in the kitchen all day.	2003-10-02

Author June Townswick discusses using many different fabrics on a single applique shape to get a nice blended effect.  She describes the various techniques that she uses and the construction of the design right down to the type of stitch.  Using this technique she presents photographs of some of the most beautiful quilts I have ever seen.  They simply have to be seen to be believed!  This is a very highly recommended book to anyone who would like to do something unique and end up with a true conversation starter.  If you have any interest at all in applique you owe it to yourself to pick up this book and examine the possibilities presented here.	2003-10-02

As a result our knowledge of exactly how the brain functions has vastly expanded.  With this ability to examine the process of thinking, learning something new, or making a major decision neurological researchers have come to the conclusion that the brain is in the process of a major change and the &quot;new&quot; brain is emerging.  Already our brain is functioning very differently from what it did only a hundred years ago.<br />Dr. Restak, a neurologist, neuropsychiatrist, and clinical professor of neurology at the George Washington Medical Center, provides a trip through this new world in his book &quot;The New Brain&quot;.  Dr. Restak does a great job of presenting the information in sufficient detail to give a good understanding of the current research, and implications of that research, without going too far into scientific detail and losing the reader.  One of the more fascinating pieces of research is the ability to tell when someone is lying by examining their brain wave patterns.<br />&quot;The New Brain&quot; is a fascinating read and a great synopsis of current research in the area of cognitive sciences.  It is a recommended read for anyone interested in this subject.	2003-10-01

Tom Serb walks the reader through the basics of sound, rhythm, notes, rests, time classifications and signatures, pitch, clefs, scales and modes, chromatic scales, intervals, triads, chord inversions, extended chords, transposition, and chord progressions and cadences.  Just under half of the book is dedicated to music theory itself without any particular application to guitar work.  This is the section that covers things like notes, rests, and other items that apply to music in general.  On page 41 he starts moving the reader into applying this knowledge to guitars and further developing your knowledge of music.  For the serious guitarist who wants to know more than how to strum a handful of chords as backup, is a recommended text.	2003-10-01

The Jabez Prayer Experiment examines the Biblical character of Jabez and his prayer to God to &quot;Do something so big in my life that it is obviously from you.&quot;  To make such a request of God was a powerful experiment in prayer.  Then, if that was not enough of an experiment, Jabez continued by asking God to &quot;Increase my influence and opportunities for you, and give me a sense of your continual presence and direction.  Protect me and keep me from falling into Satan's traps.&quot;<br />Using the devotionals in this book you are lead through the process of discovering for yourself the power of prayer.  I would suggest that it be used in conjunction with the book &quot;The Jabez Prayer Experiment&quot; but it can be used by itself.  This is a recommended purchase for any Christian unsure about their prayer life or anyone wanting to strengthen their understanding and practice of prayer.	2003-10-01

Barackman does a thorough job of examining each doctrine and the Scriptural basis for it.  I've seen several books on Biblical and Church doctrine but none have covered as many doctrines in as much detail in a single volume.  This is possible mainly because of the outline format of the book.  Mr. Barackman does not spend a lot of time discussing the details and implications of each doctrine but basically states the position and provides the Bible verses that support that position.  He also mentions other doctrinal positions and why he feels that they are incorrect (also with Bible verses to support his position).<br />Just who is Floyd H. Barackman that he should be writing a book like this?  He was an Instructor of Systematic Theology at Practical Bible Training School in New York where he taught for twenty-five years.  He has pastored several Baptist churches and authored several Bible study materials.  With this strong Baptist background the doctrines have a decidedly Baptist slant at times, but each position is still put forward professionally and the Biblical basis supplied.<br />As a single volume reference on Christian doctrine &quot;Practical Christian Theology: Examining the Great Doctrines of the Faith&quot; is a monumental work and very highly recommended.	2003-09-30

Take a walk with Kristin Ohlson through a path of self-discovery that also results in a sensitive inside look at the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration.  Ohlson stopped by a Christmas mass and found the Poor Clares quite by accident but became interested in the sixteen cloistered nuns in the small monastery in Cleveland, Ohio.  As Kristin Ohlson seeks to understand this small group of nuns at a monastery in Cleveland, Ohio she comes to an understanding not only of their faith but her own faith as well.<br />Both an autobiographical look at this period in Ohlson's life and a general biographical account of the nuns, the story is deeply moving, beautifully written and one of the best biographical stories of the year.  &quot;Stalking the Divine&quot; is a highly recommended read.	2003-09-30

In 1861 he published a second, updated edition, and in 1866 it was translated from the German to English.  This particular translation was first published in 1899 and this is the newest printing of that publication.  From the beginning the reader must understand the word psychology as it is used within the work.  Franz Delitzsch takes the position that the Bible provides an exhaustive examination of human nature.  Throughout the stories, wisdom, and poetry is an account of human nature and how human act and react in various situations.  With that in mind, an examination of the Bible shows a well-defined system of psychology, a complete treatise on human nature.  As such, a study of Biblical psychology should have as its purpose to &quot;bring out the views of Scripture regarding the nature, the life and life-destinies of the soul, as they are determined in the history of salvation&quot;.<br />Franz Delitzsch thoroughly examines this relationship between man and God, man and self, and man and his fellow man as viewed through the lens of the Bible.  Major headings include pre-existence, creation, the fall, man's natural condition, the regeneration, death, and resurrection and consummation.  The section on man's natural condition is particularly interesting.  In it he discusses the personality, the soul, the powers of the soul, development of the threefold life, soul and blood, heart and head, health and sickness, natural and demoniacal sickness, and superstition and magic.<br />After each section Dr. Delitzsch included an appendix with appropriate information for that section.  This is a nice touch as it provides the related information at the point in the book where it was studied.  If you want to understand Biblical psychology as it was understood in the late 1800s you can't go wrong with this book.  In a single volume it presents the complete understanding of the main-line theologians of the time and forms a solid basis for a historical study of Biblical psychology.  This is a very highly recommended book for anyone interested in this area of study.eologians of the time and forms a solid basis for a historical study of Biblical psychology.

Bucking that trend, author Bill George points out that to reach your greatest potential as a leader you have to be yourself.  You can't be your best if you are too busy being someone else's idea of a great leader.  Be authentic, and if you choose to emulate another person's leadership style then don't choose a style that represents who you really are.  In short, the only way to create lasting value is to be yourself.<br />With that slant on things clearly established from the beginning Mr. George starts an examination of the issues of leadership.  For example, he discusses understanding your purpose and values, leading with heart, being true in your connected relationships, and exercising self-discipline.  While many books also encourage long hours of work as an integral part of good leadership, Mr. George notes that in reality a balanced life makes you a better leader.  This balance has to be there between work, family, friendships, and community service.  Other areas discussed include employee motivation, setting correct priorities in the realm of business (customers, employees, and stockholders), the Seven Deadly Sins of business and how they can destroy your business overnight, and ethical dilemmas.<br />This is a persuasive and motivating call to ethical leadership - how to become an effective leader and create an effective values oriented company while still competing in the marketplace.  &quot;Authentic Leadership&quot; is a refreshingly independent voice among the crowd and a highly recommended read.	2003-09-29

Most other cookbooks have one, or at the most two recipes per page because of the space needed for complex preparation instructions.  That is not the case at all with this cookbook.  These recipes are simple enough that they only require two to four sentences to explain how to prepare the dish from start to finish.<br />Of course, when you are limiting yourself to only three ingredients you find that you end up with a lot of side dishes and vegetable recipes.  But, there are plenty of main dishes so a well-balanced meal can be prepared.  A few of my favorites include Rosemary-Roasted Potatoes, Honey-Orange Glazed Chicken, and June Ballard's Cajun Chicken.  To keep the ingredient list to just three the recipes take advantage of many mixes like box cake mixes or stuffing mixes.  Basically it hits all the high points for the new or hurried cook - quick and easy to prepare, goof-proof, minimal cleanup, and tasty results.<br />Another nice feature is the section with complete menu suggestions.  Ruthie Warnall has compiled a suggested Valentine Dinner Menu, Easy Dinner for New Brides, Easy Sunday Dinner, Quick Gourmet Dinner, Pot Roast Dinner, Turkey Dinner, Chicken Dinner, and Romantic Dinners for Special Occasions.  Each of the dinners contains only items from the cookbook and so are all easy to prepare with minimal fuss.<br />Comb bound so it lies flat when you are working with it, it is a recommended read for new cooks (or college kids just out of the house) and those with a tight family schedule.	2003-09-29

These nine sections are Beginnings and Early Sources, Development and Spread, Doctrines and Practices, Authority, Law, and Ethics, Spirituality and Popular Piety, Religion and Artistic Expression, Internal Diversity and External Relations, Women, Family, and Society, and Chinese and Japanese Traditions Here and Now.  The author does an excellent job of bringing the reader a basic understanding of each tradition using a Frequently Asked Questions format.  The answers are well thought out and well written so they are as clear as possible.  If you are looking for a basic understanding of any or all of these traditions and how they are both similar and different you can't go wrong with this book.  &quot;101 Questions and Answers on Confucianism, Daoism, and Shinto&quot; is a recommended read.	2003-09-29

Consistent with prior efforts from Mr. Gauthier, the illustrations are bright and colorful and sure to keep a child's attention focused on the book.  The purpose of the book is to answer common questions that children have about angels.  Some of the questions addressed include, &quot;If angels are everywhere, why can't we see them&quot; and &quot;Will I be an angel when I die&quot;.  Along with each answer there are specific Biblical references to related passages about angels.  Mr. Libby also does an excellent job of looking at various incidents in the Bible where angels are involved in giving messages, helping people, consoling people, and the many other tasks.  This book will not only bring a basic understanding of the nature of angels to your child but is also sure to bring a peaceful, protected feeling to young children.  &quot;Angels, Angels Everywhere&quot; is a highly recommended read.	2003-09-29

Each of the 45 short chapters is an interesting read and brings an appreciation for some of the unique difficulties, blessings, and humorous incidents that come along with being a physician.  Laugh along with him as he discusses his first circumcision at the home of a large, drunk man who threatened the doctor if he should &quot;spill any of my son's blood&quot;.  Feel for him as he tells of the time he could do nothing but keep a patient comfortable for a few days while he died.  Learn some fascinating history about medicine when he discusses the fear women used to have of having childbirth in a hospital.<br />The range of patients and their attitudes that have been included in the book makes it an excellent study for learning about people.  Anyone involved in the business of helping others, whether medically, spiritually, financially, or other, should read this book to understand the different types of people they will be encountering.  A very interesting read with each of the chapters standing on its own, it is easy to read a chapter or two whenever you just have a couple of minutes to spare.  The final 13 chapters are a break from the memoir style chapters before them.  With seven chapters on how life is a gift and how to create happiness in your life and the final six on drugs and how they lead to emotional and physical slavery, &quot;Life is a Gift&quot; is a recommended read.	2003-09-10

EFT draws heavily from the field of acupuncture and acupressure as it discusses the various energy meridians and how energy can be trapped or otherwise not flowing correctly at certain critical points.  Based on this information and the location of the points most important and effective in removing emotional and physical pain.  The particular points are well described and easy to locate in order to apply the principles.  The procedures are clearly explained in a step-by-step manner that makes them easy to follow without error.  Several case histories are included as well as instructions for several specific problems such as lack of self-esteem, codependency, inner conflicts, and many others.  The author takes the wise position and specifically states that while EFT is effective, if you are using it for a physical ailment then you should continue to see your doctor in addition to the EFT treatment.  EFT treatment seems to be picking up more and more endorsements by professionals and is at least an interesting aspect of non-traditional medicine.  &quot;Remove Pain: Physical and Emotional with Energy Psychology&quot; explains the principles of EFT very well and this fact alone makes it a recommended read for anyone interested in the possibilities of EFT.	2003-09-10

These days most mothers are juggling the kids, at least a part-time job, after school activities, and most of the domestic chores.  So, how does she provide for dinner without resorting to the local fast food drive through each evening?  The answer to that question is in this cookbook.<br />The recipes are delicious and you would never know that the cook didn't spend hours in the kitchen preparing it.  I say &quot;the cook&quot; because the recipes are easy enough that even I can prepare them.  This makes it perfect not only for the frantic mom preparing dinner but also the frantic college student, or anyone else with a desire for a good meal but a shortage of time to prepare one.  Some of my favorites include Fragrant Lemon Chicken and Potatoes, Chicken Stir Fry, Caribbean Chicken (for those who like spicy foods), Calypso Red Beans and Rice, Double Baked Cheddar Cheese Torpedoes, and Double-Chocolate Bread Pudding.<br />One of the things I have to comment on with this book is that it is in ring-bound form, which allows it to lie flat while you use it for cooking.  While Champion Press, Ltd. has a wide variety of specialty cookbooks most of them are not spiral or ring bound or anything similar and so are tough to keep open when preparing the food.  This one is an exception and is a highly recommended cookbook.	2003-09-10

Author William Mounce would answer that question in the affirmative and in his book &quot;Greek for the Rest of Us&quot; he proves his point.  Many people know that with an Interlinear translation and a good concordance, Biblical Greek dictionary or similar tools they can see all the possible meanings of a particular word.  However, just knowing the meaning of a particular one is only part of the puzzle of good Biblical exegesis.  You also have to understand Greek syntax.  It can make a big difference in the meaning of a passage to know whether something is an active or passive verb, a dependent clause or an independent clause, and whether words like &quot;man&quot; is inclusive of mankind or just &quot;men&quot;.  There are a lot of things to know when trying to understand a passage and the definitions of the words is only a small part of it.<br />The introductory material includes a section titled &quot;What are translations?&quot; that should be read by every serious student of the Bible.  In it he points out the problems of translation, differences between literal and equivalent translations, problems of ambiguity, moving from implicit to explicit in order to fill out a passage, misunderstandings, sensitivity issues, and euphemisms.  If you don't read Biblical Greek as a primary language and rely heavily on a translation of the Bible for your theology (as almost all of us do) then you have an obligation to at least understand these problems of translation.<br />The rest of the book deals primarily with understanding syntax and the significance and implications of whether a word is nominative, accusative, imperative, or dative form, active or passive, or whatever other form it might take.  After reading through the book I would have to agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Mounce, you don't have to be able to speak and read Greek if you have an understanding of the language and the right tools.  This is a very highly recommended book for anyone without the time to learn the Greek language but interested in deep scriptural study.anding of the language and the right tools.

It is the story of Dois Rosser who was raised as a poor child in Appalachia and ended up building churches and establishing broadcast ministries throughout the world.  This is the story of the difference that one person, fully committed to God, can make in the world.  It is a living illustration of how sometimes things don't go the way that we plan them but we find out later that they went just the way that God planned them.<br />The point of view switches regularly from that of Dois Rosser as he tells first hand what happened to that of Ellen Vaughn who reports the events as an outside observer.  The writing style is graceful and flowing as it draws the reader into the story and the ministry.  By drawing the reader into the ministry it creates excitement that can then be used to change your part of the world.  This is one of the purposes of inspiration, you become a part of something bigger; an ordinary person part of something that is way beyond ordinary.<br />&quot;The God Who Hung on the Cross&quot; is an excellent read and highly recommended read for any Christian seeking inspiration and verification that despite the bad news that is constantly played in the media, God is working His will even in the remotest corners of the earth.	2003-09-09

Inside &quot;Bill Fortney's Great Photography Workshop&quot; you will find page after page of sound photographic advice complete with illustrations and examples.  While it is a technical presentation in many aspects, he also clearly shows that great photography is every bit as much an art form as it is a technical knowledge.  Besides discussions of such things as shutter speed and aperture and how they affect the picture he delves into the importance of the right light, composition, seeing with an artistic eye, and using filters (especially the effect of a good polarizing filter).  If you like photography you will leave the book excited about the possibilities before you as you apply what you have learned.  This is a highly recommended read for any photography enthusiast.	2003-09-09

William Mounce has a gift for taking the Greek language and making it approachable even to those who have tried before but not succeeded in learning Biblical Greek.  While there are many, many grammar details to learn such as whether something is dative, nominative, accusative, genitive, active, passive, dependent, independent, etc. Mr. Mounce actually makes it interesting and finds ways to keep the student interested and feeling positive about their progress.  All those grammar rules are very important in correctly interpreting the Greek texts and in understanding English translation.  Sometimes there is no English equivalent for a Greek word, sometimes we can only approach a correct translation by approximating a similar word in English, but then our personal prejudices and beliefs affect the word that we choose.  Understanding Greek is important to a serious level of study of New Testament writings.  This book gives you the basic ability to look through a Greek text or Interlinear Translation of the Bible and understand not only what is said, but also what is actually meant but the text.  This is a very highly recommended text for anyone desiring to learn Biblical Greek and one of the best books on the subject that I have ever read.	2003-09-06

In &quot;Climbing Gardens: Adding Height and Structure to Your Garden&quot; author Joan Clifton provides solid advice on how to create such a garden.  This is not just a rose trellis type of climbing garden, there are a myriad of forms a climbing garden can take and she illustrates and discusses several of them.  The book is illustrated with beautiful photographs of garden trellises, walkways, arches, and other structures covered with flowering foliage.  On a more practical aspect it contains some more practical ideas such as the photograph of an archway covered with fruiting squash plants.  It even has a few pictures and ideas for one of my favorite vines - wisteria.  With instructions on how to build structures such as an obelisk or a living arbor, the book is very complete and a recommended read for anyone looking to add a new dimension to their garden by adding height and other structure.	2003-09-06

(School Talk, 1)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Real-world, practical advice	The sad thing about this book is that our educational system is in such a state that a book like this is necessary.  In &quot;Teacher Talk!&quot; the authors detail all the most common situations you are likely to find while teaching and how to use effective communication to handle it.

The book is laid out in a workbook style full of notes, reminder lists, examples of various written communications, self-evaluations, sign-in forms, forms for a parent to request a conference, forms for a teacher to request a conference, guidelines sheets, phone logs, behavior observation charts, and just about anything else that you could possible ask for or anticipate needing.

What would happen in today's scholastic environment if a professor decided that evolution is just one of the possibilities for the existence of mankind and that there may be others.  This play deals with this issue in that particular environment.  Professor Keyes decides that it is wrong to teach as fact something that is not proven, but that he should keep an open mind and view evolution as a likely event, but not the only explanation for mankind.  The play deftly points out how an entrenched belief can appear to be fact to those who hold it.  It also points out that there are often severe consequences to those who might take a stand against the accepted norm.  But it also shows how freeing it can be to take that stand even with the anticipated consequences.  &quot;Troubled House&quot; is a recommended read.	2003-09-05

In this book she has put together nineteen weeks worth of complete menus.  Each of these weeks is a standard five-day working week, so it actually contains recipes for five balanced, easy-to-make dinners.  At the end of the recipe section for the week is a grocery list that has all the items required to prepare that week's recipes. So instead of spending your time figuring out that you need a half-pound of hamburger for one meal and a pound for another there is a total of a pound and a half already listed in the grocery list.  Grab the list, head to the store, and know that you have all the ingredients for dinner for the whole week.<br />In addition to the weekly recipes, the first part of the book includes information and recipes for bulk cooking.  For example, how to prepare a base beef mix that can be used to prepare meatloaf, Salisbury steak, or meatballs in a flash.  It also contains some quick last-minute meal and dessert recipes.<br />Brook Noel continues to follow her philosophy of only using ingredients that are easy to find at the neighborhood grocery store, the list of ingredients being shorter than the instructions, recipes are easy to prepare by even the most inept cook, and tasty enough that even the most finicky child will at least eat a portion of it.  This is a recommended book and is just the ticket for those crazy weeks that sometimes come up where there is just not going to be enough time to cook for the family and you don't want to do fast food every evening.	2003-09-05

From people who just suffer through the pain to those who visit the chiropractor weekly to those who try to resolve the problems through physical therapy or surgery.  In &quot;The Humpty Dumpty Syndrome&quot; author Harry Oxenhandler points out that many lower back pain problems are related to pelvic tilt.  The book goes over pelvic tilt in great detail.  Chapters cover the types of x-rays used to diagnose it, how to read the x-rays, how lift therapy helps the condition, exercises that can help alleviate the problem, and many other aspects of pelvic tilt.  The focus of the book seems to be a combination of teaching the reader about pelvic tilt and preparing the reader to be able to discuss it with their doctor.  If you are experiencing problems with your back you may find a solution to your problems in this book.  &quot;The Humpty Dumpty Syndrome&quot; is a highly recommended read for its educational value in helping people understand lower back problems.	2003-09-04

Books	5	10	10	N	N	One of the best humor books in a long time	While I enjoy a good humorous read, it is rare that I find a book that makes me laugh out loud and finds me snickering well after putting the book down.  &quot;Look Who's Laughing&quot; is one of those very few books that do exactly that.  Easily one of the best humor books of the year it is hard to conceive how anyone could read it without having their day suddenly brighten up.<br />I guess it is obvious that I recommend this book very highly to anyone looking for a good laugh.  However, a word of caution is advisable here.  Read this book when you are alone or you might not be able to finish it.  A single story, a slight snicker, and all of a sudden it is moving through other people's hands so fast you'll find yourself chasing it down to get it back.  Luckily, it is easy to track down.... just follow the laughter.	2003-09-04

Judy Gruen does this skillfully in her new book &quot;Till We Eat Again: Confessions of a Diet Dropout&quot;.  Judy touches a resonating chord in everyone who has ever tried to diet as you read through her diary style collection of secret thoughts, frustrations, and even occasional victories.  Throughout the book you find Judy trying everything she can think of to try to drop fifteen pounds before her 20-year college reunion.  Every kind of diet, every kind of exercise, anything else she can find as she works.  Although her writing style is so crisp and quick-witted that anyone will find it humorous, it is really written from a woman's point of view and women are more likely to find it laugh-out-loud funny.  To test my theory I handed the book to two different women and left the room.  Sure enough it wasn't ten minutes before I heard snickering and the occasional laugh floating down the hallway.  &quot;Till We Eat Again&quot; is a highly recommended book for anyone who has tried to lose weight and can relate to the hysterical things we do to ourselves in the name of losing a few pounds.  Pick up a copy and have a great laugh.	2003-09-04

One of the more interesting parts of the book is a discussion of the business and family values of different generations and how that affects their view of success.  Rebecca points out very clearly that the obligation to carry character-based leadership throughout the company is the responsibility of individuals; of you and I.  Written in both a philosophical and motivational style, &quot;Winning Without Losing Your Way&quot; is a recommended read for anyone interested in developing a character-centered philosophy that pervades their entire lifestyle.	2003-09-02

To a great extent it is a volume on self-sufficiency without harming the environment in any substantial way.  The only assumption that seems to be made is that the land you purchase will have a house on it or you will have one built.  Everything else, from buying the land, to what plants to plant, when to plant them, where to get them, how to grow them, and how to harvest them to what animals to raise, how to raise them, how to use them for food and dairy to how to deal with child birthing in the wilderness (where you may be alone when it happens), dealing with pollution, enriching your soil, and even worm farming.  This is an exhaustive study in country living with very detailed and thorough sections on farming.  In addition the author includes page after page of other sources of information, where to purchase things, catalogue sources, websites, and just about every other conceivable way to get the items mentioned in the text.  If there was a way to take all the old-timers in the country, get them all together, draw out all the skills they have learned over the years and distill it into a book this is the book that you would create.  &quot;The Encyclopedia of Country Living, 9th Edition&quot; is a very highly recommended read not only for those looking to move to the country after a lifetime in the city, but also for those who, like me, have that backyard garden and could use the extensive information presented here to make it even more successful and fun.	2003-09-02

With that foundation firmly laid, &quot;The Backyard Playground: Recreational Landscapes &amp; Play Structures&quot; then proceeds Landscaping for Playgrounds, Large Play Projects, and Small Play Projects.  For each project there are multiple illustrations, materials lists, tools lists, and detailed step-by-step instructions to walk you through the entire project.  No steps are left out of the project.  I have seen several books that detail how to build a swing set but never discuss the appropriate ground coverings or how to correctly anchor it into the ground so it is safe.  &quot;The Backyard Playground&quot; makes no assumptions that you would already know things like this.  This text assumes that you are starting with bare ground and covers all the steps to build your project from scratch.  The illustrations are so well done that anyone can easily follow along and create a playground area rivaling the best commercial projects.  &quot;The Backyard Playground&quot; is a highly recommended book for anyone wanting to build their own children's play area and the only one I have ever reviewed that I would feel comfortable recommending to the novice handyman.	2003-09-02

Planet Wampetter has always been a particularly easy place to travel to for a visit.  You don't need any special shots, passports, or anything else you might need to visit other planets.  So, when humans come for a visit they are welcomed and the wampetters are happy to make them welcome.  Soon they begin to realize all the implications of helping the humans develop planet Wampetter into the first theme planet and try to stop the process.

Shedd starts his monumental work by pointing out that one of the strongest defenses of Christian doctrine is found through examining how various theological concepts have come about and changed over time.  This history is the story of how our understanding of God, ourselves, and the relationship between God and us has grown.<br />The first volume is divided into several sections.  The first is the influence of philosophical systems on Christian doctrine.  This examination includes the effect of the teachings of individuals such as Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero as well as the teachings of particular schools and movements like the Mystics, Scholastics, and Reformers.<br />The second section is the history of apologies.  This is the history of the Christian reply to objections raised by skeptics throughout the ages.  The Christian church first faced attacks from Judaism and paganism in the form of Ebionites, Gnostics and Pagans.  It had to deal with the problems of the relationship between faith and science and examination of Biblical and ecclesiastical miracles.  Apologetics is always an interesting area to deal with as we examine the various objections to the Gospel raised by different groups in different periods of time.  The text includes the apologetics of individuals like Anselm, Aquinas, Bernard, Hume, and Kant as well as movements like deism and rationalism.<br />The third section is the history of theology and Christology.  This is the one that I found to be the most interesting.  First he covers the arguments for the evidence of the existence of God and examines the thoughts of people like Tertullian, and Anselm.  Of course any section on the existence of God would not be complete without an examination of the ontological argument, which he covers well.<br />One of the most divisive problems of the early church was the concept of the Trinity and Christology.  How do you resolve the idea of a God who is God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit while still believing in only one God?  How do you resolve Christ's relationship with God?  Was he fully human?  Was he fully divine?  Was he two persons in one body or one person that had divine and human natures?  As the church wrestled with this many different ideas arose and gained converts.  Mr. Shedd does an excellent job of examining these different schools of thought and how they differed from mainstream thought.  Although such issues were predominantly put to rest with the Council of Nicene, they still affect the church today.<br />The first section in the second volume is the history of anthropology.  The first part of this section discusses theories on the origin of the soul.  This was a great concern for early Christians and still evokes some debate today.  Were all souls pre-existing and placed into human bodies?  Are souls created out of nothing when a new person is born?  Are the soul and body both propagated (tranducianism)?  The section continues into the doctrinal history of sin, free will, whether infants that die do so in a sinful state, and regeneration.  Even today the debate continues over whether newborn children inherit evil or whether they inherit guilt.<br /><br />The second section of this volume is the history of soteriology.  How has the Christian doctrine of atonement developed into the way we believe today?  Perhaps no other doctrine is more critical to the Christian than that of vicarious substitution, or the substitution of Christ's sacrifice on the cross for our sins.  What is the role, if any, of penance?<br />The third section is the history of eschatology.  One of the hottest topics seems to always be studying the end times according to the Bible.  William Shedd covers all the most common concerns from Millenarianism, to the Second Advent, to resurrection, Purgatory, and the final state of Christians and non-Christians after the resurrection.<br />The fourth and final section is the history of symbols.  This section includes an examination of the various creeds and other statements of faith through Christian history.  Included are the following creeds and confessions as well as many others:  The Apostles' Creed, Athanasian Creed, Lutheran Confessions, Reformed Confessions, Papal Confessions, Confessions of the Greek Church, Arminian Confessions, and Socinian Confessions.<br />This two volume set is an excellent work for those who want to examine the history of Christian doctrine over the ages and is a highly recommended purchase for all serious students.cludes an examination of the various creeds and other statements of faith through Christian history.

Many people found the &quot;New Geneva Study Bible&quot; lacking in terms of ease of understanding and clarity.  In this Bible the same information has been retained but completely rewritten to be much more approachable by the average person.  The study notes and articles are true to the spirit of the Reformation starting and built on the basic doctrine of Sola Scriptura - that the Bible is infallible and inerrant as originally given by divine inspiration.<br />One of the things that is really nice about this version is all the in-text maps, charts and graphs.  Instead of turning to the back of the book to look at a set of maps so you can follow along with what is happening the maps are right there as you need them (although there are also map sets in the back of this Bible).  The study notes are quite extensive and make this one of the best study Bibles available.  It contains over 20,000 detailed study notes, 66 in-text articles on topics significant to Reformed theology, a complete set of Reformed doctrinal standards including, Westminster Confession, Westminster Shorter Catechism, Westminster Larger Catechism, Heidelberg Catechism, Belgic Confession, and the Canons of Dort.  Each of the books of the Bible has a detailed introduction including a section on how Christ is represented in the book.  The book is designed for the knowledgeable reader.<br />While I found no problems in the New International Version text, the notes are not quite as perfect in the proofing process.  For example, I was surprised to see that God &quot;reigns in heave&quot; on page 1549.  Because Bibles are generally one of the most carefully checked books such spelling errors are extremely rare.  Eventhough not perfect, it is a significant improvement on the earlier &quot;Geneva&quot; Bible and a highly recommended Study Bible that I will be sure to consult and recommend regularly.hly recommended Study Bible that I will be sure to consult and recommend regularly.	2003-08-20

Each one of these sections has literally dozens if ideas and instructions to get teenagers thinking and working together.  I've used some of the ideas presented here and they have worked flawlessly.  Perhaps the thing that makes this book more useful than most &quot;mixer&quot; type idea books is that the suggestions are not just ideas someone thought up but are actually contributed from youth workers around the country and represent those ideas that have worked best for them.  So, it is a collection of what has already proven successful instead of a collection of unproven ideas.  The bottom line here is if you are looking for something that works then this is the book you will want.  It is a highly recommended purchase for anyone dealing with youth groups.	2003-08-20

Based on the New International Version it has over 7,000 sidebar notes written in a clear, comprehensible style.  As a result it is easy to understand the background of the different passages.  In addition to the sidebar notes it has almost 350 articles including many brand new ones since the last edition.  Multiple timelines, charts, maps, book introductions, a dictionary, a concordance, and a reading plan add even more benefit to this book.<br />If you are into Hebrew and Greek word studies or other really detailed, in-depth studies then this book is probably not what you are looking for.  On the other hand, this is one of the best versions available for the young Christian or anyone else wanting to gain a good, meaningful understanding of the Bible.  Probably the best way to explain how this Bible works is to give an example or two.  If you open it to Joshua 18 the sidebars have the following questions and the answers to them:  &quot;What was the purpose of the Tent of Meeting&quot;, &quot;What were these seven tribes waiting for&quot;, &quot;Why cast lots to divide the land&quot;, &quot;Was this an advantageous placement for Benjamin&quot;.  An example from the New Testament might be Acts 17 where it has the following questions: &quot;What did the Epicureans believe&quot;, &quot;What did the Stoics believe&quot;, &quot;Why did the philosophers call Paul a babbler&quot;, &quot;What was the Areopagus&quot; and others.  This is also an excellent resource for Sunday School teachers because it poses and answers all the most common (and many unusual) questions that people are likely to have.<br />This is simply the best version available for young Christians seeking to gain an understanding of the Bible, but it is also recommended for teachers and anyone else dealing with young Christians.	2003-08-18

Larry seems to really have a gift for how to communicate with a child.  Corbert, on the other hand, has a wonderful gift for illustration using bold colors, light and shadow in a way that draws the child and the parent into the illustration.  &quot;Who Made God?&quot; is a children's book that discusses a lot of the normal questions that kids ask (and sometimes grownups too).  Questions include &quot;If God Made Everything, Then Who Made God?&quot;, &quot;What Does God Look Like?&quot;, &quot;Why Did God Make People?&quot;, &quot;How Much Does God Love Me?&quot;, &quot;What Does God Do All Day?&quot;, and &quot;How Can I Know for Sure that I'll Go to Heaven?&quot;.

Of the recipes that I tried I had no problem finding the ingredients for all but two of them and those ingredients were still easily found by going to a local health food store.  The book starts with an excellent educational section on the differences between various species of mushrooms, olives, cooking oils, cheeses, pears, etc.  This section is a good place to turn when you are looking at a recipe that has an ingredient you are not sure about.  The rest of the book is divided into the usual categories - appetizers, salads, accompaniments, main dishes, desserts - and several final pages with food equivalents, pan volumes, and a fine section on herbs.<br />For each recipe there is a page of &quot;Chef's Notes&quot; that includes optional ingredients, cooking tips, variations, and information on special ingredients as appropriate.  All the recipes that I tried not only used only a few ingredients but also were easy to make and absolutely delicious.  Some of my favorites were Lightly Battered Portobello Fries, Phyllo Sticks with Roasted Red Peppers and Provolone Cheese, Wild Rice with Toasted Pine Nuts and Cranberries, Seared Scallops with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce, Gorgonzola-Apple Stuffed Cornish Hens, and White Chocolate Cheesecake Bites.  If you want to prepare a gourmet meal from no-fail recipes that are a minimum of fuss then you can't go wrong with this book.  &quot;Easy Gourmet-Style Cooking with 5 Ingredients&quot; is sure to become a favorite in any kitchen and is a highly recommended book.	2003-08-18

The &quot;Security+ Study Guide&quot; is no exception.  If you are looking for a book that will give you a very thorough education in computer security you can't go wrong with this book.  Some of the areas covered include access control, authentication, active attacks, passive attacks, malicious code attacks, remote access security, protocols and their vulnerabilities, e-mail security, PGP, hoaxes, wireless vulnerabilities, site problems, web server lockdown, instant messaging, Java, Active-X, CGI, FTP, LDAP, device based security, firewalls, routers, modems, IDS, servers, coax cable, fiber optics, removable media, topologies, tunneling, system hardening, updates, configuration issues, application hardening, data repositories, cryptography, public key certificates and management, forensics, risk identification and assessment, security policies, privilege management, documentation, and disaster recovery.  This is a very small sampling of the areas covered in this massive book of over 700 pages.<br />One of the things that I generally have not liked about other study guides is that they tend to give the student the information to pass the exam without them really learning anything.  Like the other Syngress books that I have reviewed, this one provides a thorough and useful education along with the information necessary to pass the certification exam.  If you want to pass the certification exam and get a valuable education in the process this is the book for you.	2003-08-13

The author, Chris Reading, is a physician in Australia.  After graduating from medical school he became qualified in psychiatry and specialized in organic psychiatry.  From this point he began to notice the relationships between vitamin-mineral deficiencies, food allergies, and genetics as they affect neuropsychiatric disorders.  Soon he was able to compile data to show that there are genetic factors in many, many problems that are not generally thought to be genetic in nature.  Dr. Reading has distilled his years of experience and knowledge into this book.<br />It is not a book designed for self-diagnosis of problems and that is good.  The book does an excellent job of explaining the basics of genetics and how the various types of dominant/recessive, autosomal, and X-linked factors work together to create a genetic pattern of inheritance.  Throughout the book Dr. Reading builds a persuasive case for examining the family tree as part of a more holistic approach to health than just treating a symptom that occurs in your generation.  Looking at the family history may reveal many clues as to how to treat a problem as well as how to avoid it altogether.<br />After discussing genetics and how it works Dr. Reading goes into the details of how to make a medical family tree.  It includes the information you should be looking for, how to get the information, how to diagram it, and even how to approach your doctor with your findings.  This is followed with a section on various illnesses and how they might have a genetic factor.  The multiple appendices include information on Illnesses, categorized for family trees, symptoms and signs, congenital defects, phenotypes, sociological data, and recommendations to help you deal with problems.<br />&quot;Trace Your Genes to Health&quot; is a guide to help you take control of your health through investigating avenues that are generally overlooked.  This would be a recommended book for anyone who has noticed a pattern of medical problems in their family and wants to know what can be done to help their doctor treat them.  If you suspect that your family has had a pattern of medical problems and want to deal with it before it becomes a problem for you then this book will help you build the information necessary to determine if you need to be concerned or not.ough investigating avenues that are generally overlooked.

In &quot;Our Children's Health&quot; author Bonnie Minsky details the &quot;nutritional crisis&quot; of America's children.  She does an excellent job of discussing allergies, food intolerances, asthma, immune system dysfunction, ADD and other learning and behavior disorders, autism spectrum disorders, vaccines, osteoporosis, eating disorders, depression, and violence and how each of these may be affected by nutritional or environmental factors.  With lots of charts, descriptions, suggestions, and other detailed information this first section is easy to follow and use.<br />The second section of the book covers how you can ensure that your child can have optimum health by discovering environmental and nutritional problems and fixing them.  The section on a diet that can be used to determine your child's food and chemical sensitivities was especially useful.  Using it anyone can work through the system to determine what he or she and their children should be avoiding.  It also includes nutritional support regimens for athletes and children.  Finally, the appendix details some safe household product alternatives to ones with more toxic chemicals.<br />&quot;Our Children's Health&quot; is a recommended read for anyone concerned about nutritional health of their self or their children.  It is also recommended for those who want to seek alternative holistic approaches to some common problems of childhood.	2003-08-13

Among these it is rare to find one that really stands out from the crowd.  Marcia Yudkin's &quot;Website Marketing Makeover&quot; is an exception to this rule.  She avoids a lot of the fluff that tends to be in other books and gets right down to the nitty-gritty of website design.  One of the things that I particularly liked about the book is that she not only provides advice but also provides the means to actually accomplish the goal.  For example, most of the website design books discus the need to see what your website looks like using different browsers.  Marcia's book also makes this very important point.  However, she not only makes the point but also points the reader to software and websites that can help determine what your website looks like in different browsers.  When other books are saying what to do without telling you how to do it, Marcia is showing you how.<br />From beginning to end, Marcia lucidly explains what works, what doesn't work, and why.  Although it is predominantly focused on how to &quot;turn visitors into buyers&quot; and so is most appropriate for a site that sells something, there is a lot of information that is also appropriate for any site including purely informational ones.  &quot;Poor Richard's Website Marketing Makeover&quot; is a highly recommended read for anyone looking to create or improve their website.	2003-07-29

Yet when other retailers were speaking of the difficulties of the apparel market and referring to it as &quot;Apparel's Black-Hole&quot; his business was not only surviving, but thriving.  What made it unique?  How has Mitchells/Richards continued to develop customer loyalty and sales no matter what the market?  Why would a customer come to a store and pay more for a suit than they would have to pay elsewhere?  The reason is simple, they make their customers feel important.<br />Jack Mitchell shares the secret to his success and what he expects of all employees of Mitchells/Richards in his book &quot;Hug Your Customers&quot;.  Many businesses say that the customer is always right, or the customer is king, but Jack Mitchell shares how he shows the customer they are special.  It is one of the very few books that define the specifics of a customer relationship philosophy instead of just speaking generically about customer satisfaction.  He also points out how he &quot;hugs&quot; his employees so they feel important and the effect this has on moral, customers, and overall business success.  Filled with practical advice and specific examples, &quot;Hug Your Customers&quot; should be required reading for anyone going into business.	2003-07-29

Each page starts with the date at the top followed by a place to put your prayer requests, a Bible verse, an activity related to the Bible verse, and a place to put how God answered the prayer.  This is a wonderful system for children to develop faith in their prayer life.  It gives the parent an opportunity to discuss the prayers and why some may not have been answered the way the child expected (such as why the prayer to win the soccer game did not work).  Journalizing gives the child the opportunity to go back and see how prayers were answered, how they may have been answered in an unexpected way, and when they were answered.  It also gives them the opportunity to reexamine their prayers as they grow and learn how to pray effectively.  To teach your child to pray, to teach them how to pray, to teach them how God answers prayer, and to see the world again through the eyes of a child, I cannot think of a better book.	2003-07-29

When it comes suddenly and unexpectedly it is even more difficult.  In &quot;I Wasn't Ready to Say Goodbye&quot; the authors take you through the grieving process as well as learning how to deal with such a tragic loss.  The first part of the book deals with issues from how to survive the first few weeks to understanding the emotional and physical aspects of grief to dispelling myths about the grieving process.<br />The second part is mainly the sharing of the stories of various people who have experienced the sudden loss of a loved one.  The stories include the loss of a friend, a parent, a child, a partner, and a sibling.  This section examines the various related problems that sometimes exist as a result of a loss.  For example, losing a partner but having surviving children, dealing with a suicide, and the difficulties of couples surviving the loss of a child are all discussed.<br />The third section discusses some of the pathways that people take through grief.  Of particular importance is that is clearly dispels the myth that we all have a particular pathway that we use to move on past a loss.  Each one of us is different and we all have our ways of dealing with grief.  What may take one person six months to recover from may take another ten years, some may cry, some may not, some may experience forgetfulness, some may not, we are all different.<br />Throughout the book the authors discuss how to be a helpful friend for those who are going through the grieving process.  The book finishes with a listing of support and resource contacts.  For those dealing with the loss of a loved one, or for those who want to help someone who is, this is a highly recommended read.	2003-07-29

What makes &quot;Guide to Buying Vitamins and Supplements&quot; different?  For each vitamin, mineral, or herb they gathered samples from multiple brands and put them through a rigorous laboratory analysis.  Results of the analysis included products that contained toxic chemicals, had no measurable quantity of the active ingredient, had more of the active ingredient than the acceptable safe levels, and many other surprises.  Although many brands were often tested only the ones that passed the laboratory analysis are listed.  This is the only place that I have ever seen a listing of product brand names that pass laboratory analysis.  Without this guide you really don't know what you are getting when you buy vitamins and supplements.  This is a highly recommended read that should be on the shelves of anyone who purchases vitamins and supplements.	2003-07-29

The problem lies in how we define security and wealth.  We all have various concepts of security and wealth that have been defined by our culture, our parents, our friends, and our experiences.  This is a shaky foundation on which to base your happiness.<br />In &quot;Inner Security and Infinite Wealth&quot; the authors examine the concepts of will, inheritance, ownership, value, trust, allowance, investment, appreciation, and exchange and redefine them into deeper concepts instead of being only related to money.  They recognize that money is an important part of net worth, but reframing the above concepts can change an individual's relationship with money.  Enlightening, well written, and powerful, this is easily one of the best books of the year in the area of self-worth and a highly recommended purchase.	2003-07-29

The recipe sources include the author's grandparents, uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters, cousins, and in-laws.<br />The book covers everything from traditional Italian dishes such as bruschetta, pinzimonio, wedding soup, and minestrone, to a wonderful section on pizzas and pastas, to recipes like hot wings that are hardly Italian but still excellent.<br />One of the many excellent dishes that I enjoyed was the pasta Alberto.  I left out the anchovies but it still tasted wonderful.  The Rosemary Chicken and the Sour Cream Chicken are also excellent choices.<br />All of the recipes have easy to follow instructions and delicious results.  Throughout the book are various tips, background information on the recipes, and family stories that make you feel at home with Kate Devivo and her family.  &quot;Manga Bene!&quot; is a highly recommended book of traditional Italian recipes along with some popular more American ones thrown in.	2003-07-29

Although most of the information could be used in other situations where you find the need to influence others this is not the primary focus.  On the other hand, if you want to be a better sales person, if you want customer loyalty and satisfaction, if you want to prevent &quot;buyers remorse&quot;, or find yourself in need of any other sales related influencing techniques this may be just what you are looking for.<br />The book is laid out like a workbook so you can practice what you are learning.  It has one of the best sections I have seen on building rapport and choosing words that the other person can quickly identify with.  It also has a fine section on how to elicit the appropriate information from the prospect in order to help them get the value they need from a purchase.<br />&quot;The Art of Persuasion&quot; is well organized and presents the information in an easy to understand, and more importantly easy to implement manner.  It is a recommended purchase for anyone in the sales related field.	2003-07-25

It seems that all around Disney World there are lots of &quot;hidden&quot; Mickeys.  From classic front profiles to side profiles they are everywhere.  For example, one of the ones you would never suspect is the shadow cast on the ground from the railing in front of Cinderellas's castle.  Hidden in maps, shadows, well placed stones, or even table settings, once you get the hang of it you are sure to find lots of them.  Some of the ones in the book are a bit of a stretch and others are obvious once you know it.  Once you start looking for them you wonder why you've never noticed things the place setting in the Haunted Mansion that makes a classic Mickey with the dinner dish and two side dishes for ears.  I even found a couple that were pretty easy to spot but not in the book (like a key against the wall in Mickey's House).<br />Not only is the book a great guide on finding the hidden Mickeys but if you follow the suggested itinerary it really minimizes the wait times in line.  Mr. Barrett has done an excellent job of suggesting how to go from ride to ride and the book is well worth the price just for that information.  We waited only 20 minutes in the longest line and generally waited less than ten.<br />In summary, it is a great twist on visiting Disney World, Epcot, MGM Studios, Animal Kingdom and other Disney attractions and a recommended purchase for anyone heading to a Florida Disney location.	2003-07-25

Needless to say, they use the method of learning to recognize whole words by sight and know what they mean.  You will find educators that decry this system as well as those who embrace it.  While there are strong opinions on both sides and I am no expert on the pros and cons of word recognition vs. phonetic, the bottom line seems to be that your child does learn to read.<br />The techniques are clearly explained in detail and easy for any parent to follow along and apply.  With regular practice in a fun environment children learn the words easily and are soon on their way.  This does require involvement by the parents and a time commitment.  However, the time commitment is minimal considering the results achieved.  This is a highly recommended book for anyone wanting to give their kids a big jump on schooling or who are home schooling.	2003-07-25

However, if you are preparing a book that you intend to be adopted by a college as a textbook, then most of those other books are of minimal value.  The writing, publishing and acceptance of a college textbook is a unique undertaking.  &quot;Writing and Developing Your College Textbook&quot; walks the potential author through the process of publishing your textbook.<br />The text takes you through the unique prerequisites for getting a publisher interested in your college textbook, use of an author team, knowing the market, the prospectus, and book outline.  Then it walks you through the signing process and negotiating an agreement, book development, reaching your audience, creation of chapter apparatus, and all the various other details that must be attended to in order for your textbook to be successful.  This is easily the single best book I have seen for the collegiate publishing market and a recommended read for anyone wishing to produce a college textbook.	2003-07-25

From simple problems like not knowing how to reset your computer clock to complex purchase decisions the same steps can be used to consistently get to the best answer.  One of the problems that I deal with on a regular basis is a total lack of knowledge among sales people and technologists.  One tells you that you need to connect your computer to a cable modem and then share off your computer to allow others in your organization to share access to the Internet.  Another says you have to install a gateway server and another says a router. One says a software firewall is sufficient another says only a hardware firewall provides real protection, and another says you really need both.  Technology can be overwhelming to the average user and sometimes even to the initiated.  With everyone telling you something different or just the need to find out how to do something, this process can be followed to get to the best result.  While the process seemed second nature to me, I realize that it is probably because I have been deeply involved in technology for many years.  For the confused or concerned that need a workable strategy to resolve technology related issues this is a recommended read.	2003-07-25

Instead of quick movements to &quot;adjust&quot; the back, it involves slower techniques designed to help the body to realign the vertebrae correctly using its own natural actions and reactions.  Jeffrey Maitland has thoroughly researched the area of spinal manipulation and with the help of Chiropractors, Osteopaths, and Rolfers has put together this text on techniques that can be understood by anyone.  The book is designed for those who want a better understanding of their back, how different problems originate, and how to resolve those problems.  This does not mean that you will never need to see an Osteopath or Chiropractor, but you may be able to resolve many basic problems yourself.  Of course you can't work on your own back and so the techniques better enable you to help others.  These are simple, slow, safe, body aware techniques and that makes this a highly recommended book for anyone who wants to understand the back, how it works, and how to live with theirs or those who want to add additional techniques to their knowledge base.	2003-07-25

This way you learn all the tips and tricks and all the mistakes that can be avoided.  Author J. R. Parrish was raised in a house on a dirt street in Macon, Georgia.  From these humble beginnings he watched successful people and applied the rules of life that he learned from them.  Using these techniques he went from being a milkman to being a millionaire.  Mr. Parrish did not have a college education or any other of the advantages we commonly think of as necessary for success.  What he did have was this set of success secrets that he had garnered from other successful men.  Mr. Parrish attributes his success to following these secrets of finance, business, investing, career, dating, marriage, school, and relationships.<br />The book is organized into five different age groups so the advice is appropriate for the priorities of that age.  This is a highly recommended book for everyone.  I will be sure to be giving copies away as appropriate graduation gifts for high school and college students.	2003-07-25

There is an alternative method of marketing, one that does not depend on an adversarial approach.  This is the point of \\"Principled Profit\\" - marketing can be done in a manner that creates a win-win relationship with the customer.  By marketing with Quality, Integrity and Honesty you can create a long-term relationship with your customers that results in even more sales.<br />In \\"Principled Profit\\" the author details multiple examples of cooperative marketing, community focused marketing, and how to turn suppliers and customers into evangelists for your products or services.  The back of the book contains an extensive list of resources including copywriters, websites, and magazines.  Basically, this is about applying the Golden Rule to marketing.  While it is not a particularly large or copious book on marketing, it does cover what most marketing courses leave out - commitment to the customer in a long-term sustainable relationship via ethical and honest treatment.	2003-07-14

How to Ignite Your Partner's Passion	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Straight to the point	&quot;Seduce Me&quot; is primarily a book about sexuality between couples.  Many couples recall when they were first dating and it seemed that they were constantly touching each other.  At time wears on that touching becomes less and less and sexual activity also declines.  Author Darcy Cole discusses physiological and psychological factors in this change and how to get back the sexual fire.  She notes that it takes very little to get men in the mood for sexual relations but men don't generally understand what is required to get a woman in the mood.  This book details the various factors involved and how they work together to get a woman interested in sex.  &quot;Seduce Me&quot; is very detailed in its descriptions and provides a wealth of information for those who want to understand the process of female seduction.  While many parents would have a big problem with this book being included in a high school library, it is a very appropriate book for those wanting to increase their partner's sexual desire.	2003-07-14

These relationships may be between husband and wife, boss and employee, friends, parents, children, or any other group of people.  The relationships may be physically abusive, or they may be emotionally, sexually, or verbally abusive.  &quot;Destructive Relationships&quot; walks the reader through warning signs that a relationship might be unhealthy by defining what is normal and what is not.  The authors follow that up with an excellent look at self-esteem issues and how to deal with them effectively instead of using ineffective coping mechanisms.  Finally Dr. Murray shows you the pathway to a positive future with healthy relationships.<br />The sections on the consequences of abusive relationships were exceptional.  They defined not only the consequence but also the various ways in which those consequences manifest themselves.  Each section then ended with an activity you can do to help lessen the power of the consequence.  There is also an excellent chapter on dealing with abusers in the real world.<br />&quot;Destructive Relationships&quot; is a highly recommended read for many people: for anyone involved in such relationships and blaming themselves, for people who seem to always be getting into abusive relationships, or anyone who knows someone in such a relationship.  It is not a miracle answer, but a pathway that the person must travel to achieve freedom from the grip of low self-esteem, emotional fear, shame, guilt, and other consequences of destructive relationships.	2003-07-14

The various things discussed in this book that cause a business to stall include Irresistible Force Stalls, the Directionless Stall (Where are we going and how do we get there?), the Wishful Thinking Stall (That's not the way I thought it would be), the Helplessness Stall (What do we do now?), the Defensiveness Stall, the Independence Stall (We can do it all), the Overoptimization Stall, the Cover-up Stall, and the Underestimation Stall.<br />The second part deals with Irresistible Force Management, how to determine the forces that affect your company, how to use them to develop a best practice scenario, and how to monitor results.<br />There are many good management books on the market today.  Very few cover the problem of why a business enterprise stops growing and what to do about it to the extent that this one does.  Because of this extended coverage of an often overlooked or marginalized area this is a recommended read for anyone wishing to jumpstart a stalled business or keep from getting into a business stall.	2003-07-11

Even the best legal argument with the most solid logic is useless if it can't be used to persuade the judge or jury to your position.  &quot;Cardinal Rules of Advocacy&quot; presents the fundamental principles of persuasion in a clear and easy to understand format.  Some of the most important rules are making sure that you understand your audience, tailoring your argument toward that specific audience, establish and enhance credibility, thinking creatively before the trial, total preparation, reframing the issues, and answering and posing questions.  Chapter three is an excellent analysis of creative thinking for presenting your case, fallacies, and appeals to emotions.  This provides a good solid basis for an argument which when coupled with the credibility and reframing the position produces a persuasive communication.  This is a highly recommended read for anyone who needs to persuade others.	2003-07-11

Through innovation in research and development new breakthroughs occur, new products are brought to market, sales brings in money to fund research and the cycle goes on and on.  At least this is the way that it is generally thought to occur.  In reality hostile takeovers, IPO bids and the like keep interrupting the cycle.  Companies refuse to look outside of themselves for innovative ideas or the application of their technology to new ventures.  So the system is actually a closed cycle within the company instead of an open one the embraces the value of processes, people, and others outside of the company.<br />Business innovations create potential but do not have value in and of themselves.  It is the business model that turns innovation into profits.  We have all seen inferior products bypass superior ones because of a better business model.  Unfortunately for the consumer, it is not at all uncommon.<br />So, the business model itself defines the profit received from an innovation.  Why?  Because the business model is the single most important factor in determining a suitable market for the innovation, costs, profit margins, and competitive position.  The business model determines whether the company will take advantage of all opportunities including those outside itself or just utilize those opportunities that they can produce internally.  The authors detail several case studies that point out the difference between closed and open innovation and the results of each very clearly.<br />The finishing touch to the book is that it clearly details the path to open innovation and how to move a company from a closed mindset to an open one.  This is a highly recommended read for anyone wanting to take advantage of technology to increase their profits.	2003-07-11

It is the story of a little girl who was the only focus of her parents' affection until a small Pekinese dog joined the family.  As a result she becomes jealous and from there her adventure really begins.  After a rough time on the streets she comes to realize and appreciate her blessings.  This is a great children's story that has a positive message.  As I read through it I quickly realized how positive this would be for children who suddenly have an additional brother or sister, grandparent, or pet come into their home and are feeling that they are not getting the attention they are used to receiving.  It is a highly recommended children's book.	2003-07-09

For many people the additional financial stress, time pressures, and other factors seem to take the pleasure right out of holidays and other special occasions.  Nancy Twigg starts with an illustration of a holiday gone wrong that we can all sympathize with - Christmas.  From there she discusses gift giving in general and the &quot;rules&quot; of gift giving that create stress.  She shows how these &quot;rules&quot; are not valid in the context of meaningful gift giving.<br />The remainder of the book examines specific holidays and provides a healthy, historical perspective of the holiday as well as simpler and easier methods to celebrate.  Throughout the book her Christian perspective is in the forefront even to the point of quoting several Bible verses at appropriate places.  Specific holidays and special occasions examined include Christmas, Valentine's day, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, weddings, Halloween, Thanksgiving, birthdays, and anniversaries.  The final chapter gives many selected resources to implement the ideas in the book.<br />Some of the ideas are wonderful lessons for children.  I especially liked the Resurrection Cookies that are part of the Easter Holiday suggestions.  Complete with the recipe and suggested Bible verses that apply to the preparation and cooking process it is a truly innovative activity.  If holidays represent additional work and stress for you instead of holiday joy and excitement then this book is for you; especially if you are a Christian and want suggestions on alternative ways to recapture the holiday spirit with a religious focus.  &quot;Celebrate Simply&quot; is a highly recommended read.	2003-07-07

Why should his rules matter?  Well for one thing he has won the Disney Teacher of the Year Award as a top educator in the United States.  Ron Clark attributes much of his success to making sure that the students follow the 55 rules.  Many of these rules are common courtesies; others are good manners, ethics, or even good hygiene. These may seem simple but people react to you differently when you display good manners and this positive feedback creates a better self-image and other positive side effects.<br />These are not just rules for children and students but should be followed by everyone including adults.  The rules are also applicable to a wide variety of adult situations.  Use the rules at home with your child and help him or her to mature with good manners and develop a positive view of life that will follow them everywhere.  &quot;The Essential 55&quot; is a highly recommended read for everyone.	2003-07-07

Written specifically for accountants who wish to become expert witnesses for accounting matters and for the lawyers who wish to use them effectively &quot;Expert Witnessing in Forensic Accounting&quot; provides a solid base on which to build.  The book provides well-reasoned advice to teach the ins and outs of expert witnessing that is specifically oriented toward accounting.<br />Some of the questions answered in this book include:<br />Do I need the expert witness to be a CPA?<br />What other experts might be better for a particular case?<br />How do I determine the best expert for my needs?<br />How does the expert prepare and what legal documents are needed?<br />How does the relationship with the lawyer and client affect attorney-client privilege?<br />How does the relationship affect the work product?<br />How do you determine the significant issue?<br />How do you explain accounting procedures to non-technical jury members?<br />&quot;Expert Witnessing in Forensic Accounting&quot; covers it all from the theoretical underpinnings of things like qualifying and testifying as an expert witness to the practical aspects of things like engagement letters and preparation for testifying.  While most accounting or litigation texts have a section or two on the use of a forensic accountant as an expert witness, I have seen none that cover it as extensively as this text.  For the accountant trying to get into forensic accounting, for the lawyer wishing to make better use of a forensic accountant, or for either seeking to improve their professional recognition in this area this is a highly recommended read.	2003-07-07

The tutorial covers browsers and document objects, HTML Documents, programming variables, expressions, data type conversions, decisions structures and loops, functions, arrays and windows objects.  No area is left uncovered from the DOM model to Cascading Style Sheets, to XML.  The book ends with a detailed section on the core language reference.<br />The book has examples of work-arounds for bugs, example scripts (most of which are also included on the enclosed CD-ROM).  There are other excellent books available but none cover all the details of Java Script to the extent this book does.  This is the most highly recommended book on Java Script that I have read to date - an absolute must on any Java Script programmer's bookshelf.	2003-07-03

Author Kay Borden details why so many people, advertising companies, and publicity firms spend so much money on news releases and get nothing for their efforts.  The last part of the book covers writing the release, and how to target it to the selected audience so that it will be printed.  One of the points that is made very clear is that a news release that does not contain something of interest to the newspaper or magazine's readers will not be published.<br />The thing I liked best and found the most useful about the book were the comments by various editors included on just about every page.  Since the comments are set in the side margin it is very easy to open the book and read through them as a quick review of what editors are looking for, what they don't want, what causes them to discard an otherwise good release, and how to get your release published.  &quot;Bulletproof News Releases&quot; is a recommended read.	2003-07-03

Most similar books spend a great deal of time discussing the spiritual aspects of auras and leave very little space to understanding and using them to improve yourself.  That is where this book differs.  It starts with a step-by-step guide to understanding the aura; it's shape, colors, and meaning.  This is followed by a section on how to change your aura via meditation.  This section details the colors to meditate on, where to concentrate, what to visualize, and similar factors.  The third and final section is about using the meditations and aura focus to change mental and emotional states such as anger, grief, worry, forgiveness, affirmations, and visualizations.  The book contains several four-color illustrations in the middle of the book to help the reader visualize and understand the text.

To make it less of a laborious read it is presented in the format of a novel.  It starts with two members of debate societies debating over whether science is correct about the creation of the earth or religion is correct.  From there we follow both the losing and winning debater through a series of life changing and illuminating events that effectively illustrate the authors' beliefs.  It is very well written for a book of this sort and teaches the viewpoint that there are other interpretations of various Bible passages that are not in conflict with science.  In fact there are several areas where the teachings are actually a return to the older beliefs.  The book also freely examines other religious views from Islam to Hinduism, Buddhism to Sufi and brings them into the discussion.<br />Strong conservatives from almost any religious teaching will probably have a problem with this book as it attempts to bring harmony between the various beliefs and show that they are all parts of a more complete whole.  Since most conservatives by definition believe that their view is right and any other is blasphemy I would expect them to have at least some difficulties.  On the other hand, those with an open spirit will probably find it one of their favorite books.<br />Having said this, I would be failing my obligation to my readers if I did not point out that there are several editing problems of a nature that I would not expect in a finished product.  While I did not make a note of them as I went along there are maybe ten to fifteen in the book - far more than the two to three maximum that I expect.  As an example, page 235 has the sentence &quot;Chester spoke to know one in particular&quot;.

One is the thoroughness of the information on how to create the impression that you are a large publisher and not a self-published author.  In fact, it walks the reader through the process of becoming a publishing house from beginning to end.  How detailed is the information?  For example, the discussion on how to get an ISBN details not only how to apply and the cost, but also what each section of an ISBN number means and how that affects the impression your book makes.  Buying a small block of just ten ISBNs makes you appear to be a small publisher of only two or three books (since hardcover and softcover, audio versions, and new editions all require their own ISBN).  How will anyone know that you just purchased ten ISBN numbers?  Actually the ISBN number gives that information.  The second set of numbers in the ISBN is five, six, or seven digits long.  If it is five then you purchased a thousand ISBN numbers.  If it is six then you purchased a hundred ISBN numbers.  If it is seven digits then you purchased ten ISBN numbers.<br />Another example of the way this book differs from similar titles is the tremendous amount of detailed, step-by-step information.

This pattern is followed throughout the book and makes it well worth the price just for the detailed contact information.<br />This is one of the best books available on the subject of becoming an independent publisher.  &quot;The Publishing Game: Publish a Book in 30 Days&quot; is a highly recommended resource for anyone looking to become an independent book publisher, publish their own titles, or just wanting an comprehensive inside look at the publishing market for the small press.	2003-07-01

Stalling comes in many forms from the &quot;that's the way we always did it before&quot; to the overconfident &quot;we have no real competitors&quot;.  Stalled thinking, in any of its manifestations, stops a company in their tracks and prevents growth and change.  Examples of things that cause stalled thinking include disbelief, misconception, unattractiveness, communications, bureaucratic, and procrastination.<br />The authors provide an eight-step process for breaking up stalled thinking and allowing creative, productive thinking to occur.  These steps include measuring performance, deciding what to measure, identification of the future and the best practice to measure it, implementing for beyond the near-term future, pursuing the theoretical best practice, identifying the right people and right motivation, then repeat the process.<br />One of the most important points is that things change and you need to be able to change with them.  Creating a best practice scenario based on wrong information, sticking to it when things change, failing to see the change, and similar items all lead us to stalled thinking.  The problem with many companies is that they don't even realize they are stalled until it is too late and they have been leap-frogged by their competition.  This text does an excellent job of teaching how to spot stalled thinking and do something about it.  On the other hand, following the process moves past stalled thinking whether you recognize it or not.  &quot;The 2,000 Percent Solution&quot; is a recommended read for any businessperson.	2003-07-01

Each one of these excerpts has been carefully selected to be appropriate for common life situations.  Eric Kampmann doesn't include page after page of personal commentary or direction for the reader.  Instead he has selected the verses and the title for the devotional and left it up to the reader to determine what it means to them.  I actually found this format to be much more beneficial than many devotional books that provide a single verse and multiple lines of commentary.  For this format to work well it is critically important that the verses are carefully selected to reflect a deeper truth and enough verses from the passage are selected to make that deeper truth easily accessible.  Eric Kampmann had done an excellent job of selecting perfect verses.  &quot;Tree of Life&quot; is an excellent devotional book that I would recommend to anyone, not just men, as the subtitle would indicate.	2003-06-30

At a minimum they help to make the business run more as a business and less as a hobby.  First she addresses the creation of a useful workspace including what you should consider before deciding where to work and how to organize it for efficiency.<br />One of the problems that most people don't think much about is the problem of office supplies.  How much do you purchase?  Where do you store them until needed?  What supplies need a monitoring system so you know when you are running low and which ones don't need to be watched as closely?  One of the biggest problems that I have seen in this area is printer ink.  There's nothing like having to stop what you are doing, run out to a store, and get another printer cartridge so you can finish getting something out today.  If you let your supplies determine your schedule you will find yourself frantically trying to get everything done.<br />The rest of the book deals primarily with organizing paperwork, creating a daily planner, home filing systems, how to handle incoming information so it is addressed efficiently, organizing receipts, time management, and even ways to turn your car into a home office if that is what you need.  If you have minimal experience with office management then &quot;Organizing Your Home Business&quot; is a good place to start gaining an understanding of the details of organizing a home business.	2003-06-30

More than just advice, it is a collection of detailed examples of phone calls including complete transcripts.  Each transcript demonstrates how the author handled a particular issue and the results of the call.  Not content to just give one example of getting an interest rate lowered or removing over limit fees, each type of problem has several transcripts so you can get a good feel for what to expect and how to handle it.  Most people are not aware of how much power they have when dealing with a credit card company and how to get things changed.  This book walks the reader through the process from beginning to end and is a recommended read for anyone looking to gain control of his or her credit card situation.	2003-06-30

With many Tai Chi Chuan books just detailing the sequence of one particular form, it is refreshing to find one that details the history, philosophies, various styles, philosophy, and spiritual development.  Author Wong Kiew Kit, a Grandmaster living in Malaysia, does a thorough job of describing and detailing the various styles.  This is the first Tai Chi Chuan book that I have read that covered more than one or two styles in detail.  Wong Kiew Kit details Wudang Tai Chi Chuan, Chen-Style, Yang-Style, Wu Yu Xiang-Style, Wu Chuan You-Style, and Sun-Style.  The illustrations are line drawings that sometimes take some effort before you really understand the movements to be made.  However, if you are looking for a reference on Tai Chi Chuan that will bring a complete understanding of the subject in all of its nuances including history, philosophy, patterns, and just about anything else, this is a highly recommended purchase.	2003-06-29

Starting with a short piece on the northern tradition in perspective, it proceeds quickly into a detailed section on runes.  For each rune it gives the Germanic, Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse names, the phonetic value and the traditional meaning as well as an illustration of the rune.  Beneath this there is a detailed analysis of the rune in terms of the culture of the time, it's derivation when known, other words it is associated with, how it was related to specific Norse gods and myths, and various other pieces of information as appropriate.  While the information is detailed the writing style is not very technical in nature and so creates a flowing, easy to follow read that anyone can understand.<br />Following this section is an excellent piece on runic divination including the nine worlds of Nordic mythology and how they relate to the conscious.  Divination methods discussed include the basic fourfold wheel and the more detailed eightfold wheel techniques.  This is followed by a very informative section on runic magic and traditional magic techniques and beliefs.  Each of the traditional Scandinavian gods is presented with a detailed profile that includes their name in Norse, English, Dutch, and German, their primary element, secondary element, color, number, totem animals, personal sigils, magical items, the purpose for which they are typically invoked and the runes used for them.<br />The book ends with a chapter on feminine mysteries that includes a short piece on the practice of Seith (mostly the casting spells and enchantments), an examination of Odin and how he related to the feminine mysteries, and detailed profiles of the feminine gods such as Frigga and Freyja.  For those who are interested in runes, northern magic beliefs and systems, or just a detailed account of how runes and magic were used historically and what they meant to the people of that time it is a highly recommended read.how runes and magic were used historically and what they meant to the people of that time it is a highly recommended read.	2003-06-29

This book throws my reading schedule completely off track.  When you find one that is so well written and so full of useful information you tend to slow down your reading speed to make sure that you don't miss anything important.  What should have been a couple of hours to read ended up taking over a week as I read one part, digested it, then went back to read another one.<br />The text covers the most important story types to tell in order to exercise influence over others, gain credibility, etc.  It also defines a story and how it can influence in ways that bare facts cannot, provides information on the psychology of how a story influences, and the important &quot;dos and don'ts&quot; of a storyteller.  Annette Simmons provides multiple examples throughout the text so the reader understands how to apply the principles right away.<br />If you are studying storytelling, how to inspire others, how to influence others, how to change corporate culture, or any other aspect of change on a personal or organizational level then your education will be lacking if it does not include the information in this book.  &quot;The Story Factor&quot; receives the highest recommendation that I can give.	2003-06-29

Jackie Silberg and Pam Schiller have compiled a collection of over 700 children's rhymes, songs, poems, fingerplays and chants.  What a wonderful nostalgic trip as I turned through the pages and read rhymes and chants that I have not heard since my early childhood.  Jumprope chants, skipping songs, songs for hand clapping games, they are all here.  Examples include Aiken Drum, Baby Bumblebee, the Bear Went Over the Mountain, The Cow, Dr. Foster Went to Gloucester, Five Little Ducks, Going on a Bear Hunt, I Have a Loose Tooth, John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt, Over in the Meadow, Sippin' Cider Through a Straw, and Zum Gali Gali.  Each of the items is followed by a Theme Connection to allow you to quickly apply the song or chant to a particular theme such as counting, chickens, cooking, pets, emotions, or families.  While most people would have no problem figuring out a theme to which they apply, the advantage here is that not only are the songs and chants listed alphabetically in the index, but there is also a thematic index to allow you to quickly find an appropriate song or chant.  &quot;The Complete Book of Rhymes, Songs, Poems, Fingerplays, and Chants&quot; is a very highly recommended purchase for anyone dealing with young children.	2003-06-29

More than just a listing of the men of the Bible, it starts with a history of Bible name, followed by an alphabetical listing of all the men named in the Bible, then a listing of the unnamed men of the Bible, and finally with an examination of Jesus Christ.<br />Some listings are just that - a listing of the name, the meaning of the name, and where it is located in the Bible.  Where more is known about the person it is included in the listing.  For example, the listing for Hezekiah covers a page and a half and includes a short synopsis of his life.  The unnamed men section includes a basic listing of men such as the Good Samaritan, the rich man, the creditor, the centurion, etc.<br />For those who might desire an examination of the men of the Bible, the ability to quickly be reminded of who Abimelech was, or to quickly get a handle on a Biblical literary reference this is a recommended reference book.	2003-06-26

The first chapters cover the basics of graphics and sound creation, manipulation, and editing.  This is followed by a somewhat nostalgic chapter on the history of game development and the various genres of games.  Finally, the last of the foundational information is supplied in the chapter on game designing elements.<br />With that background firmly in mind, the authors take you on what is basically a visual tour of game development history.  First you start out making simple two-dimensional games with simple graphics and move from there up to making three-dimensional games with advanced polygon graphics.<br />Some of the software supplied with the book are complete versions, some allow you to create a fully functional game but don't allow you to make a game you can distribute, and others are thirty-day demo versions of the software.<br />Besides basic image editors and sound editors, the supplied software includes game creation engines and commercial game editors.  The game creation software includes Game Maker, Games Factory, Pie 3D Game Creation System, and 3D Gamemaker.  Other software includes GMax to modify commercial games, MilkShape 3D polygon modeler, and Paint Shop Pro.<br /><br />How awesome of a game can you create with the knowledge gained from this book?  Well that is actually a function of the creativity of the game creator.  Even with the best software you can't create a truly awesome game if you have limited creative ability.  On the other hand, I have seen creative people make amazing games with far more simplistic software than this.  This is a recommended book for anyone with more of a creative spirit than a knowledge of programming.	2003-06-26

While this is hardly all the doctrines that are found in the Bible by the various religious groups, it is the thirty most important doctrines that are held by pretty much all of the Christian doctrines.<br />The book starts with a brief introduction to how to study Christian doctrine.  From there it starts into the doctrines of Divine Revelation, Divine Inspiration, God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, the Trinity, Angels, Satan and Demons, Man, the Covenants, Predestination, Sin, Salvation, Grace, Repentance, Regeneration, Substitution, Redemption, Reconciliation, Faith, Adoption, Assurance, Righteousness, Peace, Sanctification, Christian Ethics, Eternal Security, Prayer, the Church, and Last Things.<br />For each doctrine the chapter clearly defines it and follows with the development of the doctrine using specific Bible verse references.  On some matters, such as baptism, it provides thoughts of other great thinkers of the past.  This is an excellent book for the young Christian who wants to learn the basis for common Christian doctrine and a recommended read.	2003-06-26

Although I enjoy cooking, I use a crockpot about every six months and then it is for pretty much similar recipes.  &quot;The Complete Crockpot Cookbook&quot; has opened my eyes to the possibilities of this piece of cooking equipment.  Of course it has the expected wide variety of soups, stews, beans, chowders, and chilis (with a great Tex-Mex chili recipe).  From there it moves on to the unexpected recipes like Chicken Pattow, Beef Roast with Onion-Mushroom Gravy, Swiss Steak, Barbequed Ribs, Pork Chops, Meatloaf, and many others.  When appropriate a quick tip (&quot;Cook's Note&quot;) is included at the end of many of the recipes to help make sure it comes out like it should.  There are also short &quot;A Tip From the Kitchen&quot; sections scattered through out the book.  These contain suggestions and short pieces of general information not specifically related to a specific recipe. It is a surprising collection of recipes that will please anyone looking for new ways to use their crockpot for some delicious meals.  &quot;The Complete Crockpot Cookbook&quot; is a highly recommended read.	2003-06-26

Kindness is a way of life, a way of being.  The author points out techniques to learn to be kind by empathizing with others and as well as techniques to learn how to be kind to yourself (an aspect of kindness that many people overlook).  Not just content to explore kindness, she also explores the enemies of kindness and how to keep them at bay.  If you want to change yourself and change your world you can't go wrong with this book.  &quot;A Short Course in Kindness&quot; is a recommended read.	2003-06-15

Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is required for those individuals with a disability.  How to write an IEP that complies with the law is the crux of this book.<br />The IEP goals are required to be measurable, an item that educators often think they have covered when in fact they have not.  The authors do an excellent job of detailing how to document the Present Level of Performance (PLOP), Objectives, and Goals.<br />The last half of the book contains sample Best Practice PLOPs, Objectives, and Goals.  Although it is filled with acronyms (as are most texts involving government regulation) at least they define each of them before proceeding to use them.  For those involved with the IDEA and the IEP process in particular and feeling overwhelmed with the legal requirements &quot;Writing Measurable IEP Goals and Objectives&quot; can bring some relief by providing much needed guidance on how to meet the needs of the students while complying with the IDEA.	2003-06-15

As one of the first five women to enroll in the seminary after it opened its door to women, she experienced both support and condemnation for being there.  But one remark from one professor caused her to go on a search to prove him wrong.  That remark was that there \\"have never been any great women theologians\\".  In a field where admittance of women to theological institutions has been very rare it seems logical that there have not been any great women theologians, not because they could not have been but because the system prevented them from existing.<br />From this point she begins the real meat of the book, and what a fine meal it is.  By first pointing out that theology is really about knowing God and not about graduation from a seminary, she then shows that there have been women in the Bible who came to know God and lived their theology every day.  Through a detailed examination of Mary and Martha with an emphasis on Mary, she demonstrates how Mary grew into a strong relationship with Christ.<br />Carolyn James examines why women often shy away from theology.  She examines how Mary's experiences parallel our own in many circumstances.  Starting with chapter five she looks at Mary's disappointment with Jesus as Lazarus lay dying.  How did this circumstance affect her relationship with Christ as the teacher and as the healer?  Why does God often seem to not be there when we need him most?  How do we handle our unbelief when presented with things contrary to our beliefs?<br />While she builds a very good case for Mary as the first great theologian who seemed to understand the mission of Jesus even when his disciples were confused, that is not the totality of the book.  Chapter nine is not to be missed by anyone seeking to understand the male/female or husband/wife relationship.  It is an insightful, sound and refreshing chapter.  Looking beyond tradition, she does a fantastic job of shedding new light on the subject.  This book is worth the price just for chapter nine.<br />While it is directed toward women as the primary reader, it is a recommended book for anyone.  However it is especially appropriate for women who feel that their theology is not important because they need to be under the headship of a husband.  Your theology, your understanding of God, your relationship with God is important whether you are single, or married.  For women readers it is a highly recommended book and a source of encouragement for those seeking a deeper understanding and relationship with God.tastic job of shedding new light on the subject.

The authors take the reader through creating a measurable Behavioral Intervention Plan (BIP).  &quot;Why Johnny Doesn't Behave&quot; is not a detailed psychological text on dealing with problem children.  It is a primer on dealing with the more common problems through an explanation of how to replace the negative behavior with positive behaviors.  Perhaps the most valuable part of the book starts in the third section with detailed explanations of Functional Behavior Assessments (FBA) and Behavioral Intervention Plans.  The information includes detailed flowchart analysis of behavior and how to integrate an intervention plan into the flowchart so that the results are clear and measurable.  Sections three and four cover these in detail and are an excellent analysis of how to make an assessment and document both the assessment and the intervention plan.  With the increasingly litigation against schools, knowing how to document the behavior and intervention that was taken becomes more and more important not only for the child but for the school and educator as well.  It is a recommended read for anyone dealing with children in an educational environment.	2003-06-15

It begins with an exposition of the history and philosophy of Tai Chi. In this section the author points out that Tai Chi is both an ancient martial art and a form of &quot;moving meditative practice&quot;.  Matthew Rochford discusses the history of the various styles of Tai Chi and how it is used today for health and exercises.  These health benefits are quite extensive and include blood pressure regulation, more energy, better balance, increased white blood cell count, better breathing capacity, better posture, improved heart health, improved concentration, and a general state of calmness.<br />The second part is where the actual practice and forms are introduced.  This section is heavily illustrated and well written.  The author does well with the formidable writing challenge of trying to explain various physical movements in sufficient detail that the reader can duplicate the movement.  In addition, the author takes a unique approach by first concentrating on just the upper body movements, then on leg movements, before combining them to produce the whole body movements.  Finally an eight posture movement and a sixteen posture movement are introduced and explained in detail.  The section concludes with how to work with a partner.<br />The book concludes with suggestions on how to use Tai Chi throughout the day including doing some of the exercises while seated and a short morning, afternoon and evening routine.  For those interested in learning this ancient form of fitness this is an excellent book on the subject and a highly recommended read.	2003-06-14

Most books have some basic advice (the importance of the correct mental attitude, finding water and shelter, etc.), a handful of edible plants, and a couple of ways to start a fire.  While this book covers all those areas, it also has sections on camp craft, determining directions, rescue signals, dealing with different climates and terrains, reading clouds for weather prediction, and many others.  A good example of the thoroughness of the coverage would be the food section.  It covers your energy needs and how they are met from various foods, testing unknown plants in desperate situations, plants to avoid, identification of plants, using animals for food, extensive and detailed trapping mechanisms, fishing, gutting and cleaning, and other advice.  The number, types, and detail on the various traps are amazing.  I've never seen so many different designs.  It includes several that I have not seen anywhere else before.  I would consider this the authoritative text on survival skills in the wild and give it the highest recommendation for anyone interested in survival techniques.	2003-06-14

It is logically divided into three major divisions plus several extremely useful appendices.  The three major divisions are Disease Prevention, a thorough Body Atlas, and the alphabetic Guide to Medical Disorders.<br />The section on Disease Prevention includes information on longevity, exercises, diet, Weight control, smoking, alcohol, and screening tests.  It carefully discusses each of these items and their importance to keeping healthy.<br />The section on the Body Atlas is exactly what you would expect from the name.  It is thoroughly illustrated and covers all major organs and structures of the body including the skeletal system, eyes, ears, endocrine system, digestive system, and others.  The only one that I found lacking was the part on the muscular system.  With a frontal view of the muscular system it clearly shows how they relate to each other, however, there was no illustration of the muscular system of the back.  Since back problems are fairly common as we age I would have like to have seen a view of the back muscles in addition to the frontal.

While I was not disappointed and found several such recipes, it also contained many old-fashioned favorites. One of my favorites, old-fashioned skillet cornbread, was included in the text and is a recipe that is not easy to come by with most cornbread recipes including a fair amount of sugar (this one does not).<br />The book is divided into several sections: appetizers, beverages, breads, soups, salads, vegetables, meats, poultry, seafood, pies, tarts, and desserts. Other really good recipes include Party Shrimp and Mushrooms, Stuffed Peppers, and Poulet Luzianne. Unusual recipes that you are unlikely to find in other cookbooks include Crawfish and Corn Soup, Turtle Soup Manchac, Catfish Gumbo, Soup Du Crocodile, Jambalaya, Spicy Okra Puffs, and Creole Shrimp Stew.<br />This book is not about fancy cooking but the kind of dishes that you are likely to encounter at a church potluck dinner or a backyard family get-together. It is the traditional home-style cooking common to Louisiana and sure to please anyone looking for such recipes. \\"Louisiana's Award Winning Recipes\\" is a highly recommended read for those looking for Cajun style cooking or old-fashioned, traditional recipes.	2003-06-11

Each source is well documented as to their background and why their information and opinion should be seriously considered.  Although it follows quickly on the heels of \\"You are Being Lied To\\", which we gave a high recommendation last year, this book far better.  It contains much better written articles with a great deal more evidentiary matter presented for each article.<br />A fine example is the article \\"Pieces of the 9/11 Puzzle\\".  While it does not attempt to reach a conclusion, it does point out several very interesting facts that have generally not been released to the public.  There are so many strange coincidences that it caused Senator Richard Shelby to remark in November of 2002 that \\"The American people must know the full story has yet to be told\\".  The article includes photographs from CNN of WTC Building 6 that appears to explode before the twin towers fell on it.  The photograph of it afterwards also shows that it blew apart in the middle and apparently did not collapse as the result of the Twin Towers debris falling on it.  The author also brings up the myriad problems with Mohamed Atta's luggage, the request by President Bush to Tom Daschele to limit the investigation into September 11, the lack of black boxes from the planes, the fact that for a few weeks before September 11 the employees of the towers were evacuated several times, the fact that the head of the independent probe, Thomas Kean, has had many business deals with Osama bin Laden's brother in law, Khalid bin Mahfouz who is suspected of financing al Qaeda, and many other problems.<br />The articles are sometimes very conservative and sometimes quite liberal, but they are all interesting and pose many, many questions about dozens of media mirages and official establishment positions.  Some articles may go too far with a sort of conspiracy theory approach, but most of them present solid evidence complete with thorough documentation.  While you will probably not agree with the positions of some of the authors, you can't take an informed position without at least being aware of the information presented in this book.  For those who want to know the other side of the story so you can get a whole picture it is a highly recommended read.theory approach, but most of them present solid evidence complete with thorough documentation.

With newspapers being used to spout forth political agendas instead of unbiased news, international and national terrorism rampant, and governmental officials showing us the path to unethical behavior it only increases the confusion.  The solution, at least on a personal level, is through inquiry.  &quot;Dare to Inquire&quot; examines scientific and ethical inquiry as a pathway to truth.<br />The focus in the book is on a field of study known as general semantics.  Using the principles of general semantics you can remove illusions that appear to be reality.  In fact a major focus of general semantics is that what we perceive to be fact and reality is only a portion or one aspect of true reality. By opening your understanding to more fully grasp all of reality it opens the doors to deeper understanding, happiness and better communication in all areas of life.<br />Bruce Kodish is very blunt about the fact that this is Humanistic philosophy.  Those who have a dogmatic opposition to humanism will not like the book, others will find it interesting, informative and a recommended read.	2003-06-11

The author discusses such things as openings, developing believable characters, point of view, setting the story landscape and working with plot development.  This basic information is followed by two sections that separate this book from other basic writing books.<br />First is a chapter on professional revision that actually goes through the items that should be examined in the review process.  It includes such items as reexamining structure, plot, character traits, simplifying sentence structure, and varying sentence structure, paragraph length, word choice.<br />The rest of the book predominantly contains information on how to get your book published.  This includes tips for writing query letters, dealing with agents, submission etiquette, and even dealing with rejection.<br />The greatest value of this book is that it covers all the relevant areas of getting your fiction book written and published.  These areas are covered at a somewhat basic level and you can find other books that deal in greater detail with each of the sections but then again, they tend to not be as thorough in covering all of the aspects of writing and publishing.	2003-06-11

The text starts with 1850 when there were only two Chinese male house servants recorded in the census and continues through the 1990s. The primary divisions are: Early Settlement in Los Angeles, Chinese Exclusion Act Years in Old Chinatown, Social Conditions in Old Chinatown, The Birth of China City, Chinese Americans in World War II, Postwar Years in New Chinatown, Chinatown Troubles, The Development of Suburban Chinatown, The Emergence of the San Gabriel Valley Chinese Communities, New Roles of Chinese Americans, and The Future.<br />The book is filled with so many pictures and illustrations from the various time periods that it appears more space is dedicated to the pictures than to the words. While this might not be appropriate in other books, I have always found it to be wonderful in historical texts. Nothing takes you back in time and gives you a feel for the period as well as a period photograph or illustration. This is a highly recommended and very valuable book for anyone interested in the history of Chinese Americans in Los Angeles.	2003-06-07

As such it is not only interesting but also educational.  So many trivia books contain such obscure information that it has no value other than as a trivia question.  That is not the case with either the first or the second edition of this book.  &quot;World Trivia&quot;, second edition is a complete rewrite that contains none of the questions of the first edition.  Michael Smith again tackles one of the most difficult areas of trivia because culture, politics and many aspects of geography are in a state of constant flux.  So, while the trivia questions and answers are accurate today, within a few years many of them may not be.  With well-chosen educational and truly interesting questions the book is a recommended purchase.	2003-06-07

Sample recipes that include Thai Shrimp on Lemongrass Skewers, Grilled Portobello Mushrooms on Salad Greens, Grilled Ravioli with Spinach and Two Cheeses, Halibut Veracruz Style, Pacific Rim Chicken with Peanut Sauce, Poundcake Kabobs with Chocolate-Coffee Sauce, or Pear Bruschetta (absolutely delicious).  Of course it also has the obligatory backyard hamburger and barbecue chicken but that is where any similarity with other grilling cookbooks ends.

Within the text Jackie Silberg and Pam Schiller have compiled a wonderful collection of over 600 ways to have fun with young children.<br />Divided into various sections, the first one consists of activities.  In it you will find lots of useful ideas for every day objects from empty soda bottles, to boxes and rubber bands.  From pattern matching to tactile activities, imagination activities, tops, folding a paper hat, and a great number of other activities, it's all here and you are sure to find something that suits your needs.<br />Following this is a section on games.  Again, they don't require any special or hard to find props but simple, fun games that young children would enjoy.  Cat and Mouse, Drop the Clothespin, Flashlight Tag (one of my favorites as a child), Freeze Tag, Grass Tug of War, Spider Walk, and Walk a Crooked Line are just a few from the large collection.<br />The next section contains Action Stories.  Each story has a set of actions that goes along with it.  From the currently very popular Going on a Bear Hunt and Hey, My Name is Joe, to lesser known ones like A Spring Walk young children are sure to enjoy them all.<br />Other sections include Stories for Flannel Boards and Magnetic Boards, Listening Stories, Prop Stories, Puppet Stories, Rebus Stories, Arts and Crafts Recipes, Food Recipes, and Dances.  The book is easily worth the price just for the craft recipes section that includes such favorites as Salt Paste, Gak, Fingerpaints, Playdough, Scratch and Sniff Paint, and Soap Crayons.  And what child hasn't squealed with delight while dancing something like the Bunny Hop, Chicken Dance, Go In and Out the Windows, the Hokey Pokey, the Macarena, The Mulberry Bush, or Skip to My Lou.<br />The book finishes off with a very large appendix (slightly over half the book).  The appendix contains patterns to copy and use for the activities, flannel board stories, props, puppet stories, rebus stories and all the other things mentioned in the book.  Finally there are two indexes. One is an alphabetical listing and one is a listing by theme so you can lookup appropriate activities for a particular focus.  &quot;The Complete Book of Activities, Games, Stories, Props, Recipes, and Dances for Young Children&quot; is very highly recommended and the ultimate reference for anyone dealing with young children on a regular basis.Lou.<br />The book finishes off with a very large appendix (slightly over half the book).

Lewis Signature Classics	Books	5	797	804	N	N	His major religious works, collector quality	Clive Staples Lewis, better known as C. S. Lewis was one of the most influential Christian thinkers of all time.  Whether through symbolism in the Great Divorce, biting satire in the Screwtape Letters, or unflinching logic in Mere Christianity his brilliance shows through clearly.  \\"The Complete C. S. Lewis Signature Classics\\" contains his seven most popular works - Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, Miracles, The Great Divorce, The Problem of Pain, A Grief Observed, and The Abolition of Man.  While I read many of these years ago as a young Christian and college student this is the first compendium that I have reviewed.  Make no mistake about it; this is a collector's edition in all respects - hardbound, nice dust jacket, crisp quality printing, and even an attached ribbon bookmark.<br />\\"Mere Christianity\\" presents the basic tenets of Christianity.  C. S. Lewis breaks the book up into four parts - Right and Wrong as a Clue to the Meaning of the Universe, What Christians Believe, Christian Behaviour, and Beyond Personality: Or First Steps in the Doctrine of the Trinity.  This book is one of the most commonly recommended books for new Christians and those who want to understand basic Christian doctrine from a well-rounded apologetics point of view.<br />\\"The Screwtape Letters\\" has been one of my favorite books for many years.  While it is fictional it soon becomes quite clear that we are dealing with real world problems.  Through thirty-one letters to his nephew, Wormwood, Screwtape consoles and instructs him in how to keep his \\"patient\\" from becoming a Christian or at least from becoming an effective one.  Using the vehicle of these letters C. S. Lewis examines various issues and problems of the Christian life.  For example, he points out to Wormwood that if he can make his \\"patient\\" start going all over town looking for a church that \\"suits\\" him instead of being loyal to his local church it will reduce his effectiveness.  By searching for the \\"suitable\\" church he learns to be a critic of churches instead of a pupil of Christianity.  Not to mention that the \\"congregational principle\\" makes each church into a kind of club for a specific type of person and eventually that becomes a faction.  Each letter points out one or more of the insidious ways that a Christian or church can be slowly changed into nothing more than an ineffective shell.<br />\\"Miracles\\" is an examination of the possibility that supernatural events happen in the world.  Within the pages C. S. Lewis develops a compelling argument for the existence of miracles and God's personal interaction with the world.  Lewis examines miracles not only in the light of Christian belief but also addresses the positions of agnostics and rationalists and shows why their view is less tenable than the existence of miracles.<br />\\"The Great Divorce\\" is another fictional tale in which the narrator takes a bus ride and visits both heaven and hell.<br /> On this fanciful trip he meets supernatural beings and those who have passed on to be consigned to one or the other.  Through discussion and observation he soon realizes that the people who are consigned to hell are there because they refuse to give up even minor sinful thoughts for the greatness of heaven.  It is sure to challenge your concept of sin, heaven, and hell.<br />In \\"The Problem of Pain\\" C. S. Lewis examines one of the most common questions of Christianity.  If God is all-knowing and all-loving then why is there pain and suffering?  He deftly deals with that question from a generic point of view and does an excellent job.  You have to realize that it is not specific and so will not answer why something happened to someone in particular.  However, reading it does help provide a positive understanding of how pain and suffering can actually be a tool to grab our attention and to purify us for heaven.<br /><br />\\"A Grief Observed\\" is one of the best books on grief and working through the effect that it can have on your faith.  After losing his wife, C. S. Lewis comes to face grief and the feelings of anger and doubt toward God that often accompany such a loss.  Here we see a strong Christian and apologeticist having his faith shaken to the core and come to understand that these feelings are a normal part of grief.  However, over time he comes around to working through his grief to a stronger understanding and deeper relationship with God.<br />\\"The Abolition of Man\\" examines moral relativism and education.  C. S. Lewis argues that all morals are not relative, some are absolute.  His examination of the issues also applies very well to today's concerns with situational ethics.  Lewis points out that due to poor education, bad logic, and the advances of science mankind will eventually destroy itself.<br />If you would like a collection of some of his best known works in a solid collectible single volume you will want to add this one to your library.  \\"The Complete C. S. Lewis Signature Classics\\" is a very highly recommended purchase whether to read for the first time or as a quality edition for the C. S. Lewis enthusiast.h.  After losing his wife, C. S.

Very few teach the importance of creating a web site that is friendly and usable so the visitor has a positive experience and wants to come back.  &quot;Designing Websites for Every Audience&quot; falls into that second category.  It does not teach HTML or CSS or anything like that but what it does teach is much more important - how to create a website that people can use and want to return to time after time.<br />The beginning of the book covers pretty typical usability information, but starting with Chapter 2 the book separates itself from the crowd.  At this point Ilise Benum starts several chapters that not only discuss web site design but also tailors that discussion to specific types of users.  A website designed for learners should be different from one designed for shoppers, or one designed for transactors, or one designed for business browsers.  Ilise Benum goes through these and other user types as she discusses how websites should be designed just for them.<br />Using specific examples from existing websites, she discusses usability factors before and after changing them.  Complete with multiple detailed illustrations and analysis it is a highly recommended book.	2003-05-30

On the other hand, if you are looking for those wonderful, delectable foods served by diners all over America in the forties or fifties you will find them.<br />&quot;The American Diner&quot; has everything from diner classics like the Monte Cristo Sandwich (two recipes) to French Onion Soup and everything in between.  Other common diner recipes include omelets, Delmonico potatoes, chili, baked beans, barbecue beans, Reuben sandwich, chili-burgers, maple barbeque spareribs, Santa Fe chicken, beef stew, Hungarian goulash, sauerbraten, shepherd's pie, and chicken and dumplings.  Of course it also has popular desserts like apple spice cake, Black Forest cake, apple crisp, cheesecake.<br />While there are not a lot of cookbooks that specialize in recipes from American diners, there are a few.  That brings us to the question of what makes this book different from the others and why should you prefer it?  The answer to that is easy.  Not only does it have more recipes than most but it also includes a section on the traditional diner fountain.  This is one of the things that I remember most about diners when I grew up and the recipes are here.  Fountain specialties include favorites like the Black Cow, Black Jack, and Chocolate-Peanut Butter Milk Shake.  Included are the recipes to make the syrups for the fountain specialties.  Try one of my favorites, make the orange syrup and then make a wonderful Orange Cream Milk Shake.<br />This is a highly recommended read for anyone wanting to bring home the taste of the American diner.	2003-05-30

This includes not only how to organize your clutter but also guidance on things like avoiding interruptions and learning to say &quot;No&quot;.  She picks very appropriate passages from the Bible and uses them as encouragement.<br />It is a small book but contains appropriate advice that is direct and to the point.  There are larger and more thorough books on cleaning up your clutter and organizing your house but they generally do not include much in the way of words of encouragement.  That is what makes this book different from similar ones.<br />Because she does discuss organizing time and tasks as well as clutter, I would have to say that there is one point she does not make that I have found very useful.  She discusses using a to-do list and prioritizing that list, which is good.  However, I have found that people often give up on such lists after a short while.  One of the reasons people give up is because as they start to do their number one priority items people tend to do the ones they prefer to do first and the ones they really don't want to do are held off until last.  So, as a reward for completing a task that you don't mind doing you get to do something that you like less.  Often it is much more effective to do the things you don't really want to do first so that as you get one of them done you are rewarded with doing tasks that you like better.<br />Other than adding that point, the book was thorough and enjoyable and is especially recommended for someone who wants to organize their life but need that extra encouragement that this book provides.	2003-05-06

Death is not an ending of life but a part of the cycle of life.  Just as the horizon is not the end of the earth, neither is death the end of life.  Through a series of precognitive dreams and visions her husband, son, and herself learned about this cycle of life.  When her son Pisti died she came to understand that birth and death are just events in time and space.<br />Betty Kovacs shares her pathway to that understanding as well as the knowledge itself in a gentle and understanding manner like a wise elder relating truth to a seeker of knowledge.  Throughout the book she compassionately relates her grief and her pathway to a deeper understanding of life and death.  This is a highly recommended read for anyone seeking answers to the questions of loss of a loved one.	2003-05-06

There is good reason for this distinction and it is well deserved.  In this 15th edition, Dr. John Bear has once again produced a voluminous text that includes every known program for distance learning.  This includes not only programs in the United States but also Canada, the United Kingdom, and other countries.  It includes programs from strong, established and accredited schools, but also unaccredited schools.  The text is very well organized so the reader can quickly and easily find the schools and programs that he or she is interested in.  The coverage for each school is thorough and includes the complete school name, address, fields of study available by distance learning, contact information, a detailed description of the program, whether it is accredited by a recognized agency or a non-recognized agency, if it is equivalent to a degree mill, if it accepts other types of credits (such as CLEP exams or credit for life experience) and any other relevant information.<br />Besides the information on the schools it also includes detailed discussions on accreditation, options, use of titles, honorary degrees and just about any question that you might have.  Obviously Dr. Bear has taken note of questions that people have asked him over the years and included that information in the text so that it is much more than just a listing of schools and programs.<br />Dr. John Bear has come through again with the most thorough and authoritative text available on the various distance learning programs available.  This most current edition, like the others before it, is a highly recommended read for anyone wanting to pursue their education by distance learning and is the best text I have ever read on the subject.	2003-04-29

While there are a lot of books that concentrate on purchasing in the right location and at the right price, this is the first one that points out the right location is of no help if the real estate market is in a downturn.  &quot;Timing the Real Estate Market&quot; looks at the real estate market in a perspective similar to stocks, bonds and other investment vehicles.  From this perspective there are cycles where prices rise and fall.  The author examines not only the cycles of the past but the indicators that preceded each event.  Using these &quot;vital signs&quot; he walks you through case studies on how to determine when to buy and when to sell.  Finally, Robert Campbell discusses the ten cardinal rules of the system so that you can't go wrong.  If you are planning to invest in real estate you owe it to yourself to purchase this book so you understand the trends and how they affect real estate ups and downs.  After you have read this book and understand when the market is in an upswing, get one of the other books that discuss location and other important factors so you can get added return by buying the right piece of property.	2003-04-25

Most people with even a basic knowledge of the history of the war in the Pacific know of the Bataan death march and the condition of the people when they were rescued from camps in China and Japan.  What we generally don't know much about is what happened between those events.  Oliver Allen's story fills in that detail with his personal experiences.  He details the treatment received (including the rare instances of kindness shown by individual soldiers), the daily life in the camp, the work details, the health conditions, and the eventual liberation.  It is a story of strength in the darkest hours of human travesty, it is a story of surviving, and it is a story of winning against all odds.  For those with an interest in history and in particular an interest in Bataan or the war in the Pacific in general it is a highly recommended read.	2003-04-20

Inspired by \\"The Princess Bride\\", the style is similar enough that anyone who enjoyed that book should enjoy this one.  Although it is written for the juvenile market (age 9 or so and older) it is still a delightful read for anyone.  For a younger person the first thirty pages are somewhat slow but required in order to lay the foundation for the rest of the book.  On the other hand, once you get to the section on \\"The Oddball\\" it picks up speed, the two primary characters become well developed and the book takes off.  After that it is hard to put the book down and you may find yourself sitting up to finish it.  \\"Swords for Hire\\" is a highly recommended and enjoyable read.	2003-04-17

It is not a deep text that delves into the psyche of customers and would be used in a college level business course.  What it is is a basic workbook that explains the basics of why customer satisfaction is so important and the various things that can be done to convert an upset customer into a happy customer.  This is front line stuff at the employee level.  It is about solving basic problems at the employee level before they become major problems.<br />While manager level professionals should receive more advanced training in working with upset or difficult customers, this book is an excellent resource for anyone who has to deal directly with customers.  The workbook format with various exercises throughout make this book an excellent training tool.  It is a recommended read, but probably its best use would be to purchase a stack of them and hand it out to all new employees when they are hired.  This is the minimum that every person involved in customer contact should know.	2003-04-17

The majority cover various mnemonic techniques, the better ones including a section on biological factors - how nutrition, medication, aging, diseases, etc. affect memory.  &quot;Life's a smelling success is the first one I have seen that discusses scent and how it can be directly related to memory.<br />Dr. Alan Hirsch includes considerable information on experiments done with odors and how they affected learning and memory.  Some of the odors discussed are common ones like lavender; others include butterscotch, green apple, and peppermint.  We all know the pleasant experience of walking into a house or our favorite restaurant and smelling the wonderful odor of baking bread and how that immediately affects our mood.  Dr. Hirsch explains that our &quot;odor memory&quot; transports us back to a pleasant state when we smelled the odor before.  The premise of the book is that there are scents that do the same thing for learning.  What if there are scents that cause us to be relaxed, but still alert?  This is the perfect state for learning.  What about odors that remove test anxiety?  Throughout this text Dr. Hirsch mentions specific odors and the effect they typically have.  He gives you the tools and techniques to build what he calls an &quot;odor library&quot;.  &quot;Life's a Smelling Success&quot; gets very specific in the research quoted.  He looks at the relationship between such things as math and oranges.  Or, how do mangos and limes affect males and females differently?<br />&quot;Life's a Smelling Success&quot; is a highly recommended read that shines light on an area not covered in other memory and learning books.  Given that odors are used in everything from increasing sales in stores to calming aggressive people it seems strange that there is not more research on using them for personal growth.  Dr. Hirsch starts filling that gap with this book.  Bravo, Dr. Hirsch.	2003-04-17

He starts with the basics of defining personal branding and continues through building an appropriate brand, strategies for personalized branding, power tools for developing a personal brand, and a plan for establishing your personal brand in twelve months.

What if time were actually an illusion?  If time did not really exist them quantum physics and classical physics could be united into a unified theory.  On the other hand, if time does not exist then what are we to make of theories such as a space-time continuum?  In this text Julian Barbour clearly analyses the concept of time and puts forth the current evidence for its non-existence.  The arguments are compelling, the logic strong, and the results convincing - or at least it is convincing enough to consider it as a real possibility.  Julian Barbour is a theoretical physicist who takes this complex and counter-intuitive concept and puts it forth in layman's terms.  This is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in theoretical physics and how it is changing our view of our world.  &quot;The End of Time&quot; is sure to become an authoritative reference for any discussion on the existence of time.	2003-04-13

While the author covers XML in sufficient detail for the complete novice to understand, he also gives illustrations of how it resembles and differs from HTML.  I have done some basic HTML and Java programming before and found that the transition to learning XML was easy with the assistance of this book.  It contains enough basic stuff that nothing important is missed but moves along quick enough to keep it from becoming repetitive and boring.  By the end I not only could write simple XML documents, but also was working with Cascading Style Sheets and the Document Object Model.  This is a great introductory course that equips the reader with all the basics of XML.  There is a lot more to XML than what is in this book, but &quot;SAMS Teach Yourself XML in 10 Minutes&quot; is a thorough course in the basics of XML.  This is a recommended purchase for anyone wanting to get a basic level understanding of XML.	2003-04-13

Books	3	0	0	N	N	Interesting chronicle of author's experiences	&quot;Divinely Inspired&quot; takes the reader on a walk through the life of author Jerry Pollock.  He grew up in a family environment that can best be described as unloving and apathetic.  However, he keeps his feelings about this repressed and continues on to eventually receive a PhD in Biophysics, a professorship at Stony Brook University and a respected researcher.  Finally, things catch up with him and he starts regular visits with psychiatrists that medicate him more than help him.  He perseveres through manic-depression, electric shock therapy, clinical depression, and more prescription medication.  Eventually, he loses his research grants and the rest of his life finally collapses.  With a severe case of clinical depression he is placed on suicide watch at the local mental hospital.  The depression medicated and feeling better he is released and has an experience with a cult.  Finally he has a spiritual awakening and through a slow steady series of several small miracles he comes to have a relationship with God.  This relationship is the basis on which he finally resolves his past hurts and begins growing as a spiritual being.<br />This is an interesting chronicle of one man's experiences and growth.  However, the writing was so descriptive of his mental state that I came away from it unsure if the &quot;miracles&quot; were miracles indeed or just part of a mental condition.  Then again people who believe in miracles tend to see them, people who do not don't.  Either way, they were at least real to him and the source of his growth and spiritual relationship with God.	2003-04-10

My Life: How To Breakthrough To The Life You Really Want	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Excellent book, great organization, good writing style	&quot;I Almost Missed My Life&quot; contains 52 short (2 page) chapters that can best be described as instructional, self-help guidance on things you can do to change your life into the E Ticket life you would like to have.  The E Ticket reference is used in the book and accurately represents the author's purpose with the book.  Several years ago if you went to Disney World you would purchase a packet of tickets that contained A, B, C, D, and E tickets.  The most popular, most exciting rides were E Ticket rides.  My memories as a child include a trip to Disney World where we purchased one of these books of tickets.  One thing I recall is that the A and B ticket rides were ones that I was not interested in and only rode them because I had a ticket that was no good for anything else.

With growth rates so much lower than they were in the early nineties, businesses have increased the focus on maximizing the revenue stream.  The authors are partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers and have extensive experience in the trenches with the telecom industry.  While their advice is current and highly practical it is most appropriate for industries the have a great deal of transactions on a regular basis such as telecoms, hospitals and similar organizations.<br />The areas covered include facts about revenue leakage, causes of revenue leaks, what some companies are doing now, how to get a revenue maximization initiative going within your organization, day-to-day processes, key automated tools, quantifiable monitoring mechanisms, and the future of revenue maximization.  While the authors focus on an approach they call identify-quantify-capture, it is obvious that they have dealt in the real world.  One of the places this shows though most clearly is in the section where they discuss the problems of getting an organization to commit to a program.  It includes detailed discussion of some of the various commitment phases and the process of moving through those phases on the path to commitment.  &quot;To the Max&quot; is a recommended read for anyone in business for their self or at the head of a large department or corporation.  It is a highly recommended read if that business is involved in a highly detailed transactional business where thousands of transactions are detailed daily.	2003-04-08

What worked before will work now.  What works now will always work.  The problem is that by the time they figure out that something has changed it is often too late or many opportunities are lost.  Business models need to be dynamic.<br />Throughout the book the authors give examples of ways companies have kept their business model flexible and were able to take advantage of opportunities to stay ahead of their competitors.  If you want to get a handle on innovation and creating a dynamic business model that is sustainable over time, then this is the book you are looking for.  &quot;The Ultimate Competitive Advantage&quot; is a very highly recommended book for anyone seeking that missing piece in their business education that will allow their business to soar above the crowd.	2003-04-08

Why is this particular mutiny significant?  It is the only British mutiny to occur during wartime where the mutineers actually delivered the ship to the enemy.<br />Written in a narrative style, \\"The Devil Himself\\" clearly illustrates the naval conditions of the time.  Seamen were often impressed into the naval service against their will, advancement was difficult but often given for political reasons as much as talent, flogging was common, and in the case of the Danae the quarters were small and the ceilings so low that you could not stand up at all.<br />A sleek ship, the Danae could overtake just about anything else on the water.  What would cause the ship's crew to mutiny?  Why would a mutinous crew actually deliver their ship to the enemy?  Other mutinies had occurred but they resulted in better conditions for sailors, why was this one so different?<br />This is a fascinating read for anyone interested in historical events.  Put together from the British and French Naval archives, where it is in a folder labeled Le Diable Lui-meme - The Devil Himself, it is a recommended read.	2003-04-05

While all of the advice is sound, this is a common subject for books and there is a lot of competition for market share.  All of them cover common problems of the entrepreneur, mistakes to avoid, important steps and strategies to take, etc.  Most also contain motivational stories and information.  So, why should you consider this book over other similar titles?  Well it is the only one that I have read that includes some very important factors to personal success.  These important factors include one that is left out of most lists.  That factor is forgiveness.<br />It is critical for success that you be able to forgive not only employees that make errors but also errors that you make.  I have seen many businesses fail because the head made a mistake in judgment that they then spent all of their time trying to recover instead of just forgetting it and moving on.  A truly successful entrepreneur has two personality characteristics that are not mentioned in most business books.  One is that they can forgive themselves and others and move on.  The other is that they can't be too personally attached to their ideas.  If they try something and it fails then try it different, change it, or try something entirely different, but don't be so personally attached to the idea that you have to make it work just the way it was originally conceived.  While the author does not come out and express this as one of his top factors, the idea is embedded within the pages of the book.  This recognition that the successful entrepreneur must be able to forgive, adapt, and move on is what makes this book different from most.<br />The rest of them are sound business books for the entrepreneur and some of them will still be required (such as a book that includes information on the business form you might want to take - corporation, partnership, sole-proprietor, etc.) but this book should be the beginning point.  Use this book to determine whether you have what it takes to be an entrepreneur or not.  It is a recommended read for anyone thinking about going in business for their self.beginning point.

He covers the personal characteristics necessary for successfully working from home, home office furnishings, balancing problems with family life and work life when at home, strategies for getting the employer to accept the proposition of working from home, and many other things that are critical to your success but often overlooked when considering working from home.  The book ends with four appendices that provide a teleworker aptitude test and three sample contracts.  I've been involved in teleworking for some time where I spend some time at the office and some time elsewhere providing work product.  This is the most comprehensive book on the subject that I have read and so is a highly recommended read for anyone who is thinking of changing their work style to a teleworking paradigm or who is thinking of taking a job where teleworking is required or an option.	2003-04-04

In the form of shadowy figures it tells the story of how we move through an emotionally crippling event to a whole new world.

Eventually, these are followed by Hope, Faith, and then finally Joy.<br />We enter life full of joy and involved in the dance of life.

In short, it is the story of the sun telling various countries \\"Good Morning\\".  For each country visited it shows the words \\"Good Morning\\" in their native tongue and mentions an item of significance in their country.  The sun says \\"Good Morning\\" to American and the Statue of Liberty, to Mexico and Chichen Itza, to Germany and the Brandenburg Gate, to Russia and the Kremlin, to France and the Eiffel Tower, and to China and the Great Wall.  All in all, it is a good book to start introducing children to geography and other cultures, however, it would have been better if it had at least put the visits to the various countries in the order in which they would be visited by the sun.  This would allow additional discussion of geography and the movement of the earth.  Obviously, the sun would not visit the countries in the order of America, Mexico, Germany, Russia, France, and then China.  Still, it is a true children's book with pages that are treated so they can easily be cleaned of dirty fingerprints and other travails of children.  \\"Good Morning, Sun\\" is a recommended purchase for young children.	2003-03-30

It is not for the timid or those offended by foul language but the hurt and pain the author has endured is openly visible through the text.  What makes this story somewhat different from most is that it is a case of recreational abuse, abuse that is done just for the pleasure of the abuser.<br />The author takes us from her earliest childhood memories, through her childhood growth years, and on through high school to adulthood.  At each stage she shares her thoughts and experiences as a child.  This book will appeal to people who identify with the abused person and those who want to acquire a detailed knowledge of the potential of this type of abusive relationship.

Shelly Durrell deftly takes the reader on a highly informative journey through the story of Parzival and the Grail complete with a detailed psychological analysis.  At the same time she explores how the theme is used consistently throughout some of the most successful films of our time including Star Wars, Forest Gump, The Natural, and others.

By understanding Parzival and the Fisher King we come to understand how to heal our own emotional wounds.<br />A story of hurt, growth, and healing, \\"Healing the Fisher King\\" is a wonderful read as Shelly Durrell provides a thoroughly illuminating examination of all aspects of the tale.

This leaves you with the option of including pizza dough or flour, water, and other ingredients of the dough.  On the other hand when it comes to toppings what could be added?  You could get really creative with this in determining what is appropriate or not.  What about ice cream for a topping?  Not appropriate?  Maybe it would be if the \\"pizza dough\\" were phyllo, the \\"tomato sauce\\" were ice cream and the toppings were strawberries with chocolate drizzled across it.  Open a child's mind to the possibilities of the world is one of the best gifts you can give them, this book helps you get started with many, many questions that can be used to help them think creatively.<br />If you would like a collection of questions to ask your young child that will help them learn manners (\\"What do you do if someone has bad breath?\\"), basic science (\\"Do fish have feathers?\\"), or expand their creativity (\\"What do you like to pretend to be?\\") this is a great collection to get you started.

That is the premise behind &quot;The Mate Map&quot;.  The author takes you first through the basic principles of the Mate Map as well as dispelling relationship myths and defining relationship truths.  With this foundation then laid, he takes you through the Mate Map process in intricate detail.  The process is easy to follow and is complete with forms and examples of how to work with them as well as an extensive section on how to interpret them.  The idea is that you would go through the process yourself and the other person you are interested in would also go through the process.  The result is a map that shows how compatible the two of you are.  The process is extensive and appears to provide a detailed analysis of what is important to you, what is not important, and what you are really looking for in a relationship.

While it looks at several historical curiosities such as how the team had the technology to send a satellite into space before Sputnik but was held at bay for political reasons, the majority of the book examines the case of Arthur Rudolph.  Arthur Rudolph was one of the German scientists involved in U.S. rocket research.  After completing the majority of his research and developing the technology he was suddenly accused of Nazi war crimes and deported.<br />The author, William E. Winterstein, is in an excellent position to walk the reader through the case.  He is a retired military officer and was intimately involved in the rocket research project.  As he gets into the details of the Rudolph case it appears at first to be just a case of a person trying to clear the name of a good friend.  But further reading shows that he is not only determined to clear his friend's name but has a great deal of clear and convincing evidence that the Federal investigators had an ulterior motive for deporting Rudolph.  What that motive might be is never clear, but Mr. Winterstein includes copies of letters, and other evidence that clearly points to a governmental conspiracy.  He presents much of the evidence in a voluminous series of appendices to the text.<br />People who are interested in conspiracy theories will enjoy the book as it definitely opens a lot of questions and leaves them unanswered.  If you are interested in history, rocket science, political science, conspiracy theories, or just want to know what the government is capable of doing to the innocent this will be one of your favorite books.  The title \\"Gestapo USA\\" may be a little overboard, but the subtitle \\"When Justice was Blindfolded\\" is a perfect description of the situation.  This is a highly recommended read and sure to become a favorite for those interested in historical truth.hose interested in historical truth.	2003-03-20

All of us know about our conscious, obvious rules and how these affect our behavior.  But what about those other rules, the ones we hold deep down inside that are not so obvious but still affect our behavior.  Jordan Weiss takes us on a trip to discover the rules we hold and how those rules affect us.  He does this by setting up a scenario, asking a question about it, and then asking us to choose one of three answers to the question.  Each of the three answers are then explained so you can understand the subconscious rules that are related to the answer you chose.<br />Jordan Weiss, MD takes on several important categories in his analysis.  The first area to be discussed is Money, then Work and Career, then Gender Roles, Power and Control, Health, Personal Expression, Friendship, Spirituality, Sex, and Love.  Some of the scenarios will present easy answers for the reader and others will present more difficult questions to answer, but answer them you must if you want to understand the internal rules that control your behavior.<br />The one thing that I did not like was that some of the scenarios don't offer enough information to choose one of the answers.  For example, in the Gender Roles area there is a scenario that goes like this: \\"You serve in the military and are presently in combat.  Your safety depends on the courage and skill of your superiors.  An error in judgment could be fatal to one or more members of your squad.  Your direct superior, who is a woman, commands a specific course of action.  One of your team members - a man who is a highly experienced fighter - disagrees and refuses to comply.  Who do you follow?\\"  The answer choices are: \\"A) I trust my superior and I will obey her commands, B) I don't have confidence in my commanding officer; I feel better going with the man's opinion, or C) I have a tendency to trust the man's opinion, but to avoid court-martial, I will do what I am told.\\"  There is simply not enough information to make any kind of informed opinion.  What is her experience level with actual combat?  Why does the other experienced fighter have a problem with the command?  Is his argument reasonable?  Is her reason for the command reasonable?  Does he not want to comply because he has a problem with her being in command or is there a legitimate reason?  Was she ordered to issue her command from someone above her who is sitting safely elsewhere not even familiar with the current situation?  There are so many possibilities that make a difference as to whether I would choose A or B that it is hard to choose either.  Further information could move the decision solidly from one to the other.  While he raises some very good scenarios and they can point to very good information about yourself, they often are not simple enough to be reduce to three possible answers.  Of course, you pick the best that you can of the three and read all the explanations and perhaps it still sheds some light on your secret rules.<br />\\"Our Secret Rules\\" is a recommended read for those who want to examine their personal rules and how they affect their actions.  The scenarios and choices, while not exhaustive, are at least illustrative of various internal rules.  If you can't figure out which answer you would choose you can at least examine the underlying issues in the explanations.<br />For this book I would suggest that you enjoy the journey of discovery, but try not to overanalyze things too much as I often have a tendency to do (which I am sure is the result of some sort of other internal rule that I have).will do what I am told.\\"  There is simply not enough information to make any kind of informed opinion.

Standard entropy theory has always indicated that a system that is orderly will, over time, move to a position of less and less organization.  However, that is not always consistent with observations in real life.  Steven Strogatz does an inspired job of describing how synchronization exists in such small areas as fireflies and plant leaves to much larger concepts of the universe and the asteroid belt in our solar system.<br />One of the more fascinating sections of the book deals with synchronization in human beings.  It covers current research in areas such as sleep rhythms, circadian rhythms, the tendency for women to match menstrual cycles over time, body temperature rhythms, and various other normal cycles of the human experience.<br />This is a very academically oriented text that many with only a passing interest in such things might find too detailed and scientific for their likes.  On the other hand, for those with a keen interest in the cycles of the natural world and current research into this emerging field this is one of the foremost texts on the subject.  It is a highly recommended read for anyone with a desire to learn about how natural tendencies toward synchronization move us to spontaneous order.	2003-03-16

Books	4	6	6	N	N	Would be 5 star except for blatant self promotion	&quot;The Secrets that Lie Within&quot; is a well written fable that explores the disabling effects of fear in a person's life.  By using the art of fable the authors take us on a journey from an ideal village where the people are happy and open to outsiders to one that has become fearful of outsiders and built walls around the city.  While this practice does keep others out, it also keeps the inhabitants prisoners inside their own city.  A few more enlightened citizens leave to find out the truth, but by the time they return everything is different and they are outsiders.<br />While it is a story of this village, it is also a story of our internal selves.  When faced with things that confuse us it is easy to retreat to a place that is walled up and safe.  This seals us in from the danger but also leaves us a prisoner of fear and false beliefs.  The story is an example of how to follow your heart and restore harmony to your self.<br />While it is a story of reclaiming the peace that should be yours and finding your true self, every opportunity within the book is used to point the reader to the Tru-Self program, a part of the Tru-Skills program which is in turn a program of Tru-Skills, LLC, a corporation that was started by the authors.  As such it is not only a wonderful story of overcoming fear and reclaiming your self, but also a piece of marketing literature.  Unfortunately the continuous references to Tru-Self reduce the effectiveness of the message.  While it may be an excellent program to help people work through problems such as that represented in the book, it would have worked better if it were put in an appendix with an explanation of the program.  With the over-abundance of marketing hype that people are exposed to everyday, I found it made the red flags go up immediately the first time I saw the words Tru-Self show up in the text.  This immediately reduced the enjoyment of the fable itself.  But even with this caveat, it is still a recommended read.	2003-03-16

For example the book of Second Samuel covers roughly the same time period as First Chronicles, Second Chronicles covers pretty much the same period as First and Second Kings.  How were all of these people and events related on a consistent time scale across the various books?<br />&quot;The Book of God&quot; is very effective in resolving this problem by taking all the Bible stories and putting them in chronological order.  The author then rewrites them in the style of a contemporary novel.  While this may not be appropriate for exegetical Biblical study it is extremely valuable if you want to truly understand the Bible as a whole.  The author takes many liberties in writing but they are well-researched and based on historical knowledge.  For example, he starts with Abraham with the words &quot;An old man entered his tent, dropping the door flap behind him.  In the darkness he knelt slowly before a clay firepot, very tired...... The man's face was lean and wounded and streaked with the dust of recent travel.  He began to unroll a straw mat for sleeping but paused halfway, lost in thought.&quot;  Obviously we don't know that Abraham ever did this or looked like this, but it is all consistent with the normal lifestyle of nomadic travelers of the time.<br />Again, it is not for determining doctrinal positions but an enjoyable novel that is not only a pleasurable read but also brings the various stories of the Bible together into a complete picture.  It is a very highly recommended read.	2003-03-12

This book should be in every Christian church library and on the shelves of any Christian with young children.<br />\\"God Is With You: That Is All You Need\\" is a wonderful book detailing various scenarios where children might be afraid and supplying just the right amount of scripturally based advice.  The book deals effectively with situations like when you feel lonely, when you are afraid, when things go wrong and you want to give up, when you have a hurt that won't go away, when people lie about you, when you feel understood, when you are concerned about the future, when you are asked to do something very difficult for you, and when your best friend moves away.  These are some of the most common and difficult problems of children and the teachings of this book can help them move through those difficult times.  The book ends with a very basic version of the plan of salvation and invites the child to ask Jesus into their life.<br />In addition to a wonderful story, \\"God Is With You\\" is beautifully illustrated by Corbert Gauthier.  The detailed and brilliant use of color creates a visual feast that is sure to hold a child's attention even with the rather long readings on some of the pages.  I will be sure to look for the name Corbert Gauthier as illustrator on other children's books when considering items for review.<br />In summary, this is one of the most highly recommended children's books that I have ever reviewed.	2003-03-12

Looking at factual events that have occurred and are still occurring she takes us through example after example of women coming together to change their world.  Examples from the book include the mothers who organized in Argentina to stop the disappearance of their children when the police, political system, and even the church would do nothing.  Or the mothers that organized to demonstrate against the violence in Northern Ireland and the reduction in violence that resulted.  Or the group of mothers in Larchmont, New York who started an organization to help with the domestic needs of the terminally ill.<br />Mother power does not only occur on such large scales creating groups and organizations to change the world, but also on much smaller scales.  The author demonstrates this with stories such as the mother whose son wrote the Pulitzer Prize winning novel \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\".  Her son was unsuccessful at getting it published and when she reread it after his death she decided that it should be published.  Her story of how she continued after multiple rejections and dead ends shows how her belief in her son's novel carried her through to finally getting it published.<br />This book is a great collection of factual stories that show how women and the instincts and qualities of motherhood are changing the world, sometimes one person at a time, sometimes whole nations at a time.  \\"Mother Power\\" is a highly recommended read.	2003-02-26

Most people are familiar with the standard view of the process of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  Herb Orrell has noted that many people don't seem to make that last step and as a result end up in some sort of continuous depression.  With that in mind and his many years of experience as a minister, he has come to the conclusion that there may be a stage missing.  That stage would be the search for meaning.<br />This is a book that examines grief in detail from an empathetic viewpoint.  The way from depression to acceptance involves a search for meaning in the event.  When we search for meaning and ask &quot;Why&quot; the traditional religious reaction is not to even attempt an answer but to point out that asking &quot;Why&quot; is wrong.  The author walks us through his experience and his questioning of why bad things happen to good people.  Why do children starve?  Why does God allow a child to continue in an abused home?  Asking why is not wrong, but part of our normal search for meaning.<br />Herb Orrell examines the role of fear, anger, and atonement in moving through grief from a very personal perspective.  This is a highly recommended book with a truly innovative view on working through the stages of grief.	2003-02-21

John P. Schuster masterfully with these and other questions in &quot;Answering Your Call&quot;.<br />The author makes a strong argument that we often don't feel fulfilled in life if we don't know our purpose.  The reason we feel we have no purpose is because we continue to miss our callings when they occur.  With this as his thesis he works through the process of knowing what a call is, recognizing when you are called to do something, and responding to your call.  This is a fresh and insightful look at defining purpose in your life and a recommended read.	2003-02-21

While there are several books on the subject available and many more that have a chapter on intuition, this book is unique in one very important aspect.  It is the only book I have seen on intuition that effectively explains how to know when something is intuition and when it is not.  People often learn to distrust their intuition because it has proven wrong when in reality it was not intuition at all.  Learning to discern when something is truly your intuition speaking to you and when it is not is critically important if you are to learning to trust your intuition.  This is a recommended read because the discussion of discerning intuition is so well done.	2003-02-19

Paterson, PhD has spent years treating depression.  The results of everything he has learned through both education and experience are distilled into &quot;Your Depression Map&quot;.  The author points out that there are many, many different causes of depression and many, many different types of depression.  Each of these different kinds of depression requires a solution that is designed to relieve that particular type.  Based on this idea, he leads the reader through an understanding of the different types, how to determine the type that you have, and a pathway to recovery.  He deals effectively with myths about depression, building your personal recovery plan, and a discussion of the journey to recovery and what you should expect.  Even issues of how to deal with depression in real life are covered.  For example he deftly covers the kind of professionals that you may need to seek help from, medication, living with emotions, building and maintaining a social network, and preventing future difficulties.  If you are dealing with depression or know someone who is fighting that battle, this is an excellent book and a highly recommended purchase.	2003-02-19

From discussing the qualities of trees, plants, water and soil to a discussion of color coordination, use of rocks, insects, butterflies and wildlife it covers all you need to know to create a garden that is in harmony.  I particularly liked the chart that provided a list of plants to be protected, the insects that attack them and the guard plant that will repel that insect.<br />While useful for those who are not of the New Age mindset, the last half of the book includes a chapter on communicating with angels and fairies to help with your garden and an extensive section on Feng Shui.

Each chapter then takes one of those lies and examines it in detail from how to identify it to determining how it affects your life to a pathway to freedom and choice.<br />Have you come to accept any of the following lies as truth?

It is a book on being true to yourself no matter where that takes you.  In a world that defines power and success in terms like paycheck size, job title, number and size of deals closed and similar measures it is okay for you to define success and happiness by your terms.  In fact, isn't your definition the only one that really matters to you?<br />&quot;The Female Power Within: A Guide to Living a Gentler, More Meaningful Life&quot; guides the reader in learning how to achieve peace and happiness by realizing that &quot;power&quot; does not necessarily mean &quot;aggressive&quot; but greater power can be achieved through cooperation and communication, two of the traits more commonly found in women.  The very factors that others define as power, such as aggressiveness, can be the same factors that actually limit your power.  Be yourself, seek your goals, follow your own destiny and realize your power by doing so.  This is a well-reasoned exposition on how to make your life more meaningful by being your &quot;authentic&quot; self.

And yet, as he goes through his various experiences, interlaid within the story itself is the story of how rebuilt his life, the strategies that worked, the techniques that benefited his life, and how he has become more in control of his moods.  It is a story of hope and practical guidance for those dealing with bipolar disorder or those who know someone with the disorder.  The author masterfully leads the reader through learning to rebuild their life without resorting to jargon or a cold, sterile treatise on the disorder.  Intensely personal, highly educational, it is a highly recommended read for anyone wanting to know more about bipolar disorder for whatever their reason.	2003-02-02

Favorite songs include the Little Red Hen, which most people will recognize as a story from childhood where none of the other animals will help the hen plant the wheat, weed the garden, or harvest the wheat but they all want to help eat the bread.  Another fun song that was new to me was Little Parakeet.  But it was so much fun that I found myself singing it over and over again.  Professionally done and fun to sing to while learning or practicing another language, it is a delightful product to share with children.	2002-12-25

Each tells the story of their early life, marriage, family experiences, and children.  Each also tells the story of finding out that their spouse was sick, working through the sickness, and eventually losing them anyway.  The stories detail their struggles with the children, problems with finances, friends, feelings of loss, and all the other feelings on their emotional roller coaster ride.  They tell their experiences as a young widow/widower and their introduction back into dating.  After several false starts and problems in the dating scene they eventually found each other.  This is their story, the story of Gary and Kathy Young and how they survived the loss of their spouses at a young age and eventually found each other.<br />Told from both the male and female perspectives and full of insight, it is sure to be helpful to anyone experiencing loss and looking for hope.  Of particular value to those going through a similar loss are the items in Appendix A.  It includes the changes and fears that a young widow/widower faces as well as the thoughts and problems that they have to deal with.  It provides a great point of reference for those who would like to help someone experiencing the situation.  A highly recommended read for anyone experiencing such a loss, who knows someone going through it, or who might be placed in a position to counsel or deal with someone with such a loss.  There is very little literature available specifically for young widows/widowers and this is among the best.	2002-12-25

In many ways it is pretty stock science fiction with an evil scientist, a hero (or two), and an experiment out of control.  In other ways it is a refreshing production.  Not your typical audio book, it is more reminiscent of the old radio productions complete with various characterizations, sound effects, and background music.  This is an actual production of the storyline and not a reading of a book.<br />The production takes 4.7 hours to listen to in its entirety.  The only thing about the production that I found annoying was the accent of Stan Hangjab.  Instead of relaxing and listening and enjoying the production I found myself straining at times to try to figure out what he said quick enough to keep up with the story line.  Considering the quality of the sound effects and all other parts of the production, I resented having to work so hard to understand what the main character said.  In a minor character role this would not have been much of a transgression, but in the primary character it is a problem.<br />Other than that issue, the story line was good, the production fun, and the characters well defined.  It is a recommended purchase for those who find the accent natural and comfortable.  Before purchasing it go to the web page at ... and listen to the first chapter.  You will know right away if you find Stan's Hangjab's accent too annoying or second nature.	2002-12-25

How could he even think that being able to have sex was as important as living?  For Keith the decision was not as easy.  With his male ego wrapped up in the decision and the importance of being able to have sex with his wife it just was not as simple.  After deciding in favor of the operation there was a lot of adjustments to be made and Virginia found that things were a lot more complex than she had imagined.<br />In \\"Making Love Again\\", Virginia and Keith Laken invite the reader into their personal lives and the difficulties they faced as a result of his prostatectomy.  Their thoughts, fears, hopes, and disappointments are laid bare to the reader as they openly discuss deeply personal questions and feelings.  If you ever wanted to know what it is like to deal with impotence in a marital relationship this book deals with the emotional struggles that are not normally discussed openly.  The power of a loving commitment, strength for the challenge, and hope shine through as well as a true commitment to help others through the copious listing of sources of help in the appendix.<br />Readers should be cautioned that because this book necessarily discusses sexual intimacy between two people some may find it too graphic at points.  On the other hand, it shows the extent to which the authors are letting the reader into their personal lives.  \\"Making Love Again\\" is a very highly recommended book for those going through concerns about a prostatectomy or any sudden impotency of a permanent or temporary nature.	2002-12-25

Just like a regular toolbox each of these tools has a specific purpose and you may find that one is more useful to you at one particular time than another one, but together they comprise a complete tool set for any occasion.<br />Some &quot;tools&quot; are concrete financial advice, others are more philosophical or psychological in nature, and still others cross into the metaphysical.  For example, one &quot;tool&quot; is a process to figuring out exactly where you spend your money and how much you spend.  This is a critical part of changing your financial picture and a very sound process.  Another example is the fact that many people carry around false beliefs about money.  These beliefs have to change in order for you to change your financial picture.  This is also sound financial advice but since these contain psychological factors the process for removing them is also a psychological one.  And still another example would be kinesthetic muscle testing to get in contact with your &quot;inner knower&quot; for answers to questions.  This clearly falls into the metaphysical for most people.<br />The trick here is to actually use this as a toolbox.  Use the appropriate tool for the job and use the ones that you understand how to use.  If you don't agree with the metaphysical tools don't discard the book, just use the ones you are uncomfortable with.  There is a lot of good information in this text and it is written in a light approachable manner that most people would enjoy.  For example, she discusses the bargain trolls; those things that cause you to purchase an item just because it is a tremendous bargain, not because you need or want it.  It's not a bargain if you would not have normally purchased it; it is a waste of money.<br />Although it is written with a definite slant towards women (most men would get little value out of a tool for organizing their purse), it is a recommended purchase for anyone who wants to take control of their finances and don't know where to start.e out of a tool for organizing their purse), it is a recommended purchase for anyone who wants to take control of their finances and don't know where to start.	2002-12-25

Their purpose is to be uplifting and motivating to the reader.  Hopefully, they change the reader's attitude over time and make their life better by applying the affirmations.  Applying?  Yes, if you plan to just read this book and expect your life to change you will be disappointed.  It does include some wise advice like not waiting for your ship to come in but instead sending out ships of your own.  This involves action.  If the affirmations are what you need to keep you on track and moving forward then this will be a great book for you.  Of course, there is more to this book than just affirmations.  It is designed for the reader to read a page a day.  Each of these pages starts with a very applicable quote (which I found more motivating than the affirmations).  The quote is followed by a story, advice, explanation, life application of the thought of the day, or similar text.  Then the page is concluded with the affirmation for the day.  While I did not particularly like many of the affirmations and found some of them patronizing, I did enjoy some of them.  To me the value of the book is in each page's very appropriate quote and the rest of the page right up to the affirmation.  Others may find the affirmations valuable.  A very good book that I have no hesitations recommending, it was a joy to read.	2002-12-18

William Federer has done an excellent job of collection these quotations, documenting his sources, and giving some background on the individuals.  That does not mean that there are not some curious quirks in the book.  For example, for many of the people quoted he has included a small picture of them.  However, at the entry for William Henry Seward, who was Secretary of State under Lincoln, there is no picture of Seward, but one of Lincoln.<br />Entries are listed alphabetically by the person being quoted.  Which is great if you are looking up a quote by someone in particular like Abraham Lincoln.  What if you don't know who made a quote but want to look it up by subject?  No problem, as the author has also included a subject index at the back of the book.<br />This is an excellent book and a recommended resource for those who might be looking for a particular quote from a founding father, court, state constitution, or more modern person such as Martin Luther King, Jr.  However, it should be understood that it many not accurately portray the complete attitudes of our nation at any given time.  If someone from another country were to read the words of Martin Luther King, Jr. and conclude from these words that the United States was a haven of peace in the 1960's with non-violence being the rule we would all be quick to point out how wrong they were.  However, there are no quotes in this book from that time period that would indicate otherwise.  This is true to the author's stated intent - these are quotes about &quot;America's God and Country&quot; and any other items are not included.  To realize that a conclusion like the one about the United States during the time of Martin Luther King, Jr. is completely a farce and still race to make the same conclusion about our Founding Fathers is ludicrous.  And yet, I see that as the greatest problem with this book; people will use it for the purpose of &quot;proving&quot; that the United States was based on a Judeo-Christian philosophy without any consideration of the social context, habits, or other writers, statesmen, or leaders of the time.<br />Still, I rank it a highly recommended read as the author has done an excellent job of doing just what he purposed to do with the book.

Alabama Sweet Potatoes, Monte Cristo Sandwich, Butterscotch Pie, you'll find recipes here that you won't find anywhere else.  But don't look for any shortcuts here; these are the original recipes, which means the recipes don't start with a plain cake mix but with flour, eggs, and salt.<br />The book can be confusing at times like where step seven of Dixie Diner's Blueberry Pancakes say to &quot;bake in your waffle iron&quot;, which would make it a waffle and not a pancake, or the Chipped Beef recipe that does not include toast or biscuits in the ingredients list but does state to serve it over toast or biscuits, a bit of an annoyance if you are done preparing it and then find out that you have no bread.  Things like this are the only reason this did not receive a full five star rating.<br />Still, even with the small annoyances, the book is a pleasure to read.  To add to the enjoyment of the book, it is filled with illustrations, advertising, and photographs from the appropriate years.  For those who would like to travel back to a time of simple pleasures the book is a wonderful nostalgic trip and the recipes sure to delight.	2002-12-18

Taking her writing style he brings her back to life as one of the characters in \\"The Hours\\" and places her in 1923 London writing her novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  Spanning across time and space the other primary characters are Laura Brown in Los Angeles in 1940s and Clarissa Vaughn in Greenwich Village in the 1950's.<br />Clarissa Vaughn is planning a party for Richard, a poet dying of Aids and her oldest love.  Many years before he had nicknamed Clarissa \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" after the character in the novel and indeed she parallels the Mrs. Dalloway character in many respects.<br />The Laura Brown character is also introduced while preparing a party.  Her party is for her husband's birthday.  Laura is pregnant and looking for more to her life than being the housewife and mother.  In her searching she has become fascinated with the novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" and reads it fervently to the point that she escapes into the fictional life of \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".<br />Michael Cunningham does a great job of producing a highly readable text that intertwines the lives of the three women.

Each of these chapters has a checklist to help keep out of gridlock, an interpretation section to define if you are experiencing the roadblock, a set of frequently asked questions, and a series of checkpoints that define the highlights of the chapter.  Together these make the book very useful for anyone seeking to avoid gridlock or determine if they are in a gridlock situation.<br />The second part of the book contains the details of the U.N.L.O.C.K. system to resolve strategic gridlock.

By far the largest section of the book is the one on Tips for Connecting With Your Daughter.  Many of the tips are items that the author has done with his daughter and found effective.  Others are nothing new in the area of advice for pre-teen parents.  Still others are insightful and offer the sharing of new ideas that a caring dad can add to his repertoire of ways to relate to his daughter.<br />While the author indicates that the book is targeted to the 8 - 12 year old age group many of the ideas can be used on much younger daughters and people with five-year-old daughters and older should consider the book.  While this book can provide much needed direction to some dads and at least a few gems for even the most experienced dads, I might also suggest it's companion book for moms: &quot;Mom's Everything Book for Daughters&quot;.  Together they provide a pretty thorough guidebook to building a strong, personal relationship with your pre-teen daughter.	2002-12-12

The book follows three families from England to the American colonies as they seek a better life.  Using the vehicle of a historical novel Virginia Parker does a masterful job of showing the complex relationships between the Quakers, the Puritans, the Indians, profit seekers, and those whose primary purpose was religious conversion.  The reader comes to understand the difficulties of life in the colonies and many of the problems and triumphs to be had there.  Become a part of the families as you live their hopes, their dreams, and their realities.  A well-done, recommended book for anyone who enjoys fiction based on historical events.	2002-12-12

It is one of the most useful and practical books available for building a relationship with girls of this age.  What I particularly liked was that she does not just give you advice such as watching a &quot;chick-flick&quot; together but goes a step further to list some recommended movies.  Instead of giving obscure advice like many other relationship books, the author provides specific, definitive ideas.<br />As you read through it don't miss the highlighted sections on Rave Reviews (suggested additional materials for the section) or Just for Fun (lots of fun activities for you and your daughter).  These are the things that separate this book from other similar ones.

The time period is from 632 A.D. to 661 A.D., Islam is in turmoil as the once unified peoples have scattered and become predominantly a culture of multiple warring tribes.  The book is written from the Muslim point of view and includes descriptive details of the violence that was common during that time period.  The story line is filled with intrigue and treachery as various factions of the Arab groups vie for power and Mu'awiya is caught up in the events of the time.  If you want to understand the customs and mind-set of Islam during that period of time, John Elray does a masterful job of bringing the reader into the daily life and frustrations of the military actions and deceit that were common then.<br />With well-developed characters and a good story line it is a recommended read with the following reservations.  First, this is a novel about very turbulent times and includes a lot of violence.  If you don't like violence in your reading then this is not for you.  My second concern is that readers understand that this is a fictional novel based on historical events at the beginning of the rise of Islam.  The reader should enjoy the book as a novel and as a window to understanding that time period, not as a political commentary of modern day Islam.  If you are able to do so then you will find it an interesting read.	2002-12-12

With several public relations problems, the firemen need a new union representative, the department needs to improve their image, and the mayor needs to make the citizens have faith in his administration.  Of course others also want to run for offices and there is a fair amount of corruption within the ranks.  Cash Rivers becomes the much-needed hero on the department but his problems are just starting.  Moving up the political ladder from obscurity to being in the public eye he attracts his share of well wishers as well as those who would wish him ill or use him to serve their own purposes.<br />The book starts out as a rather slow read.  It picks up steam around the middle and by the end it is hard to put down as you are drawn into the morass of plot twists and turns and wondering what will happen next.  A recommended read that most readers would enjoy if they can persevere through the first third of the book.  The reward of a good story justifies the perseverance.	2002-12-12

The book begins with a section on &quot;Perfectibility of Words&quot; which defines wordiness and provides various examples of the different types.  The following section is &quot;The Imperfectability of People&quot; which discusses the prevalence and acceptance of wordiness in society.<br />The extensive dictionary actually begins on page 49.  Each listed phrase or word combination is followed by suggested substitutions, an example using the &quot;wordy&quot; phrase, and the same example using the correct substitution.  If you are wondering if your writing could be more concise or looking for a suggestion for a phrase that just doesn't feel right, or just want to learn better writing skills then this is the book for you.  It is the largest and most useful compendium of excessively wordy phrases and practical, workable substitutions that I have had the pleasure of using.

How things affect us is based on our attitude.  This is where the book &quot;Life is an Attitude&quot; comes into play.  The bottom line is that you determine what kind of life you have and what kind of life you will have by your attitude.  Even when your life seems out of control, you are still in control of yourself and your attitude.  Of course that is easy enough to say, but we all have baggage in our lives and sometimes keeping the correct attitude is not easy.<br />Each of the 46 chapters of &quot;Life is an Attitude&quot; focuses on one specific aspect of a person's overall attitude.  At the end of each chapter are exercises and suggestions on how to incorporate that aspect into your life.  And if that is not enough, the book contains multiple very appropriate thought provoking quotes.  As you work through the book you learn that you are in control of your life and how to keep in control and happy.  Although several parts of the book show that it was written for an adult audience (maybe late thirties or older) it is still a recommended read for anyone.	2002-12-06

Heraclitus was a Greek scholar who answered many of life's questions with comments that were purposely designed to be obscure.  This forced the recipient to think creatively to find their answer.  Many of them contain internal paradoxes and so part of the creative process is figuring out the paradox and how it applies to your situation.<br />As Roger von Oech goes through each of the thirty selected epigrams he includes some of the ways that they can be interpreted, ways that they have been interpreted in the past, anecdotes, jokes, and riddles that illustrate the epigram and other ways of illuminating just how deep these pieces of wisdom are.  Does he give a complete explanation of how they can be interpreted?  No, because that is part of the design of these epigrams, they can be applied to different circumstances and product different but still correct answers.  His illustrations are there to open your mind to the creative possibilities that lie hidden within just a few wise words.<br />Some of these I have heard in the past such as &quot;You can't step into the same river twice&quot;.  Others are less common but just as full of wisdom such as &quot;On a circle, an end point can also be a beginning point&quot;.  If you want a book that expands your creative mind and also shows you how to break out of old patterns of thinking in any situation, then this is the book for you.  Well written and sure to point the reader to new directions of thinking, it is a highly recommended read.	2002-12-01

What makes this book unique from other books on symbols is the worldwide approach.  A specific symbol can mean widely differing things in different cultural contexts and the authors do a wonderful job of examining each interpretation.  Each symbol has a number that is cross-referenced to the index at the beginning of the book making them easy to find.  In addition, the symbols are categorized into eight general categories for easy browsing.  The categories are Heaven and Earth, Characters and People, Body and Actions, Living Creatures, Mythical Beasts, Flowers, Plants and Trees, Objects and Artefacts, and Abstracts.  Each of these categories is also subdivided.<br />Each of the symbols discussed has a line drawing of the symbol along with a detailed description of what the symbol meant to different groups, how it is used today, various ways it was drawn, etc.  If you want to know about the various symbols that surround us this is an excellent place to find out.

The 12th Edition of this wonderful cookbook will be no exception.  The newest version has hundreds of new recipes and an entire chapter on crockery cooking.<br />For those of you who are frustrated with cookbooks that only have sections for appetizers, main dishes, beverages, and desserts you will be thrilled with the organization of this cookbook.  It is divided into multiple sections so you can easily find an appropriate recipe.  The sections include Cooking Basics, Appetizers and Snacks, Beans, Rice, and Grains, Beverages, Breads, Cakes, Candies, Canning and Freezing, Cookies, Crockery Cooking, Desserts, Eggs and Cheese, Fish and Shellfish, Grilling, Meat, Pasta, Pies and Tarts, Poultry, Salads and Dressings, Sauces and Relishes, Soups and Stews, and Vegetables and Fruits.<br />I particularly liked the section on cooking basics which covers such topics as equipment, appliances, tips, time tested secrets, a glossary, information on seasonings, nutrition basics, food safety and storage, meal planning, and even place settings.<br />Unlike other books that indicate a preparation time of an hour for a recipe and then in the recipe itself indicate that it takes another three to cook it, there is full disclosure of time to prepare the recipe.  The total recipe time is divided into section such as preparation time, cook time, chill time, etc. so you know exactly how much time it will take to complete the recipe.  Recipes that are quick to prepare or low fat or no fat are marked with a colored rectangle so they are easy to spot in the recipe section or the index.<br />As with all cookbooks, if possible get the hardcover version as it will wipe off easier and make sure it is at least spiral bound if not ring bound so that it will lay flat.  The preference is for ring bound because you can take a page out if necessary and just use the page as a reference instead of trying to find a place in the kitchen for the whole book while cooking.  Clear instructions, many illustrations and photographs, and just plain delicious recipes you can't go wrong with the Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book.

A totally fictitious university the satirical catalog includes a history of the college, course listings and descriptions, clubs, awards, crime statistics, admissions information and everything else that you would expect in a real college catalog.<br />A good example of the strength of the satirical style would be the Hysterical Blindness Award.  A student scholarship, it is awarded to two students who &quot;simply convince themselves that the world doesn't have any problems.  Award is very similar to how the United States of America refuses to officially recognize the nuclear capabilities of countries it doesn't like.&quot;  Or perhaps a little information on one of the clubs would be a better illustration.  How about the Future Corporate Raiders of America?  They &quot;conduct hostile take-overs of other campus groups, fire all the old members and sell their club equipment back to the University.

While his investigations over the years has lead him to the conclusion that they are of supernatural origin he does not shy away from examining the issue of other possible causes and provides a strong argument for his position.<br />The text is very thorough and provides one of the most extensive analyses of crop circles that I have ever read.  Analysis of the history of crop circles is exhaustive as is the analysis of fraudulent crop circles and mathematical relationships within the crop circles.  While the arguments and analysis was generally very convincing and well laid out I had some difficulty accepting some of the mathematical analysis as being significant.  For example, he looks at geographic patterns and discusses the relationship between the shapes and other geometric shapes.  One contains a hexagon and another various triangular patterns, etc. and these are significant. Well if it is a geometric shape then several of these relationships are going to exist by definition of it being a geometric shape.  It is kind of like making a big deal out of a circle with four tangent lines that form a square around the outside of the circle and making the observation that if you bisect the square at any point it also bisects the circle... well that is by definition of the shapes in question.  So, while he seems to go a little too far in seeing those relationships he also does one of the best jobs that I have ever come across in refuting the case for true crop circles being created by people.  A detailed and fascinating read, I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in crop circles.	2002-11-30
1322837:US	43546353	R1J1H4Y5QZJ1FH	0375408746	411655503	The News About the News: American Journalism in Peril	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good perspective on the reality of news journalism	Two veteran reporters of the Washington Post have pooled their talents to produce &quot;The News about the News&quot;.  Leonard Downie, Jr. and Robert Kaiser provide a detailed analysis of the problems with news today and how it got into the current condition.  They take the position that the news used to be about good journalism but today the emphasis is on making a profit.  How does one make a profit in the media business?  Well the surest way is to make it entertaining.  Could this be why there is a minimum of international reporting in the news today and an expansive reporting of the social life of celebrities?  Downie and Kaiser argue persuasively that it is.  When the focus is on increasing shareholder value then the method is to increase subscriptions or viewer share.  The way to do this is to provide information that the purchasers or viewers want to see.<br />The whole situation reminds me of a conversation with a history book publisher when he was asked about the fact that the history book for middle school students had so many errors he stated that they are in the business to sell books and not to supply correct history texts.  School Boards generally have parents that help select the textbooks for the system to use and so they print history the way the parents want it portrayed.  It does not matter if it is correct, what matters is that it is accepted by as many schools as possible.  This seems to be somewhat the same attitude of today's news media.  While what they state may or may not be correct, it is often highly biased and hard news is often left out in favor of news of minimal value.  Apparently the current direction of news is to entertain more than it is to inform.<br />Downie and Kaiser make a point that unbiased, hard reporting will also sell papers and increase viewers.  There are people who want a complete picture of the news and they will tune in to a news broadcast that is less entertainment and more informational.  They note that fewer and fewer people are tuning into the news as the broadcasters scramble to try to increase their market share of a declining pool.  What they don't note is the effect that things like cable television have had.  I know many, many people who have come to tune into the BBC News Channels so that they can get a decent news broadcast and actually know what is going on in the world.  Perhaps the pool of people who are watching the news is increasing, but the group of people who watch it for entertainment purposes is decreasing.<br />&quot;The News about the News&quot; is a recommended read for anyone interested in what goes on behind the scenes at the news or a brief survey of how news has changed over the last twenty years.  Well written in a style that is easy to read it is sure to dismay those still naive enough to think that the news is reported in an unbiased and complete manner.  But the authors hold out hope that as the media realizes that it can also make money with hard-hitting and informational news it may start the pendulum swing back to good journalism.  We can all certainly hope so.nd fewer people are tuning into the news as the broadcasters scramble to try to increase their market share of a declining pool.

In &quot;Coping With Uncertainty: 10 Simple Solutions&quot; the authors provide the reader with a framework for dealing with uncertainty.  Often with uncertainty comes feelings of vulnerability, loss of control, depression, and fear.  The ten solutions offered are 1) Accept Uncertainty as Part of Life, 2) Evaluate Your Real Risks, 3) Change Obsessive Thoughts, 4) Restore Inner Harmony, 5) Release Tension, 6) Improve Your Tolerance for Frustration, 7) Develop Healthy Self-Acceptance, 8) Learn to Forgive, 9) Connect with Others and Create Meaning, and 10) Learn to Be Flexible.  As you can see they are not really ten separate solutions, but ten principles for a complete solution.  Each chapter covers one of the ten solutions in detail and how to apply it in life.<br />Although at 137 pages it is a fairly small book compared to others of this genre it is tightly written with very little fluff.  Written by professionals in the field of psychology and based on years of experience it is a recommended read for anyone having difficulty dealing with uncertainty.	2002-11-30

The author starts by establishing his credentials - he is not only a professional therapist but has had an anger problem that nearly ruined his life.  He tried the therapies that were thought to help but was not successful.  In fact, he found that many of the traditional therapies actually made his problem worse.<br />In this text he goes over the techniques that he found actually worked to change his life.  These techniques came out of a whole new approach to anger, this approach is to treat anger as a recovery situation.  This brings me to the only item that I had a problem with in the book.  In chapter 3 he discusses how to respond to questions of &quot;why&quot; from a spouse, sibling, or other person.  For example, if asked why you got so angry and threw the lamp against the wall then you should use one of the answers given in the text.  The basic idea of the answers is understandable as they focus on the angry person taking responsibility for their anger and actions.  However, the way they are worded is highly questionable.  For example, one response is &quot;I'm crazy&quot; or another is &quot;I'm stupid&quot;.  Current traditional psychotherapy would say to word it more along the lines of &quot;What I did was a crazy thing to do&quot; or &quot;I did a stupid thing&quot;.  Taking responsibility for your actions is one thing but taking it to the point of putting yourself down and endangering your self esteem when angry people often already have low self esteem does not seem like a good idea to me.  Then again it is hard to argue with results.  From the cases listed in the book and the comments from other people that have used it successfully it does seem to work.<br />If anger is controlling you in any way and you want to start living a postive and fulfilling life then this book is for you.  I would use caution with the wording in Chapter 3 and feel that you could take responsibility without the self-deprication, but other than that this book seems to offer hope to people who have been unsuccessful in controling their rage in the past.

Organized on the basis of the progressive growth of Stephen's feelings for the forest it is divided into four basic sections. The first is enchantment in which the photographs demonstrate how the Amazon enchants the visitor. The second section is disenchantment and focuses on the perils of the jungle. Spiders, snakes, camouflage and death are parts of the disenchantment as the reality of the dangers of the Amazon forest comes to light. The third section is work in which the photography relates to understanding the forest in all of its detail. Filled with giant lilies, orchids, birds of various types, and similar photographs it is the melding of the enchantment and disenchantment into a deeper understanding of the Amazon basin. The fourth section is longevity, the movement to lasting commitment and joy based on a complete understanding of the Amazon.<br />While the pictures alone make the book worth the purchase price, the narrative that goes along with the pictures is also interesting. The narrative helps the reader to understand how the author and photographer moved through the four stages of growth. From the romantic concepts of the rain forest they started with to the fears and struggling for survival as they became lost in an uncharted area to rescue and reflection it is an interesting tale on its own.<br />For those that enjoy photography, it even includes exposures and setting information in the back for each picture along with comments by the photographer.

Reestablishing that connection can be a source of wholeness and health.<br />She builds her case that even when we are born babies soothe themselves with sounds, melody, and rhythm. Then as toddlers we make up songs and hum tunes. As we get older at some point many of us lose that connection with our innerselves. That is where this book comes in. How do we reconnect with the musical part of ourselves? How do we use that connectedness to make our lives better?<br />Louise Montello provides specific techniques to reestablish that link. Based on Eastern chakra philosophies, she provides ways to increase your self-awareness, to touch your creative side, to bring healing and wholeness to your body and spirit. The proof of the success of the system is contained in several cased histories and personal testimonies.<br />This book falls squarely within the realm of alternative health and for those who are comfortable with the ideas of chakras it will prove to be an interesting and highly beneficial read. For those who are not comfortable with Eastern Philosophies she does an excellent job of explaining the reasons behind EMI and is very convincing. It is when she moves to therapeutic techniques that it moves to the Eastern philosophies. However, it appears that the chakra philosophy is used more as a vehicle to explain why the therapies work than as a required part of the therapy. If a therapy works it doesn't matter to most people why it works as long as it does. A valid form of centering and therapy it should prove useful to just about anyone. A recommended read.	2002-11-16

The purpose of the book is exactly as the title states - each recipe takes only five ingredients.<br />If you are tired of recipes that requires so many ingredients that the clean up time is longer than the preparation time then this is the book for you.  No corners are cut on these recipes, they are absolutely delicious, just what you would expect from Better Homes and Gardens.<br />It contains the typical divisions for a cookbook - appetizers, beverages, salads, main dishes, sauces, sides, and desserts.  In addition it has a section of recipes just for children and a section on meatless main dishes.<br />Make sure to try the Stuffed mushrooms in Phyllo or the German style beef roast.  They are both excellent.  Although I really liked the cookbook and it definitely has its place in the library of anyone who loves to cook, there are two things that I did not like.  First, is that it is not spiral bound and so does not lie flat so you can reference while cooking (although I understand that they do have a spiral bound version available - definitely get the spiral bound if you can find it).  Secondly, I found the cooking times to be deceptive.  You should always read the instructions in detail if preparation time is an issue.  For example, the &quot;Easy Elegant Beef Roast&quot; is listed with 15 minutes preparation time and one and three quarters of an hour roasting time.  If you read the roasting instructions they state that one and three quarters to two and a quarter hour for medium rare and two and a quarter to two and three quarters of an hour for medium.  The preparation time listed under the recipe name should not have the minimum time but either an average time or a time range such as &quot;one and three quarters to two and three quarters of an hour depending on taste preference&quot; or something similar.  For this cookbook just keep in mind that the roasting, cooking, baking, etc. times are the minimum times.<br />Still, a highly recommended read and a real asset to any cookbook collection.the recipe name should not have the minimum time but either an average time or a time range such as &quot;one and three quarters to two and three quarters of an hour depending on taste preference&quot; or something similar.

With over 500 recipes it contains many common recipes as well as many newer ones.  What makes this cookbook different from many others?  The answer to that would have to be that the recipes are all either trim and healthy recipes concentrating on lots of fruits and vegetables or are more traditional recipes that have been altered to be more healthful.  If there is any place in the recipe where a healtier ingredient can be substituted without changing the quality of the taste of the food then the substitution is made.  Sometimes it is not a substitution of ingredients but a healthier way of preparing the food.  Either way, if you are looking to change your eating style or that of your family to a more healthy regimen without sacrificing flavor then you can't go wrong with this book.	2002-11-16

It teaches us that if a project or activity fails then we are a failure.  This is a real problem because the only way we don't fail is if we don't try.  Moving forward means that failure will happen at times.  Instead of teaching that failure is personal in nature we need to redefine failure as part of the learning process.  Failure has a purpose.  Failure can be used to grow as a person or to redefine and improve a project or plan.<br />&quot;The Power of Failure: 27 Ways to Turn Life's Setbacks into Success&quot; provides a framework for redefining failure and using it to get ahead and improve your life.  Failure can be a devastating factor that completely stops a person in their tracks or it can be the tool that they use to become successful.  The choice is yours.

It starts with why a person smokes, then follows with how it hurts the smoker, the benefits of quitting and then finishes with stories from people who have quit.  While this may be beneficial to some people it ignores the fact that for most people the reason they have a hard time quitting smoking is because it is an addiction.  Many, many smokers would quit today if they were able to and all the ones I know already know the dangers of smoking and the health benefits of quitting, but that has not helped them to quit.  There may be some smokers that benefit from a detailed discourse on how bad smoking is for you and how much better you are if you quit.  Still others may benefit by using it as an aid to keep them motivated.  If they are on a nicotine patch program, hypnosis program, or some other program then reading this may help to keep their motivation level high and increase their success.  However, the greatest benefit of this book may be as a preventative with teenagers to make sure that they realize just how bad smoking can be.	2002-11-15

Set in a fishing metaphor it is an entertaining read while covering the dynamics of male/female relationships.  The text contains various tests (Big Fish Test, Bait Self-Quiz, etc.) that are insightful and fun.<br />It's enjoyable to watch the author continue to develop the fishing metaphor for all the situations he discusses - spooking away men, favorite fishing holes, the keeper, landing the big fish, etc.  While he doesn't expound on anything new the fishing metaphor makes it fun while allowing the reader to look at various aspects of the dating ritual in a new way.	2002-11-15

The text reads like a research paper.  For those who like a well reasoned arguement framed in the classical rhetorical style of persuasive argumentation it will be an excellent read.  For those who hold a position for a more emotional or philosophical reason than an intellectual one the reading will be tedious.<br />The author actually does an excellent job of defining \\"erotic\\", analyzing various other people's discussions on the topic, discussing where they are strong and where they fail and delivering a position that covers the weaknesses in the other positions.  She points out that sexual morality as it relates to teenage females has been a topic of research for several years now.  However, the conclusions among various researchers and philosophers has been inconsistent.  She builds a persuasive argument that the purpose of sexual morality among teenage girls is primarily to wait until they are in a relationship where there is a strong level of trust.  In a time of their life when they are trying to understand the many issues, feelings and fears of adolescence trust becomes the primary factor of when they are ready to experience the erotic.<br />Written from a feminist point of view Fundamentalists will have a hard time with the concepts presented here.  However, it is persuasively argued and a fine example of classical rhetorical technique.  Those who enjoy a research paper style of writing it is a well done book.	2002-11-15

Everyone knows what is expected of them and the rituals that we go through to help us to work through the grief.  However, the loss of a family pet can be very devastating and leaves the pet owner with no set of rituals to help move pass the pain.  &quot;Parting Words/Parting Ways: Saying Good-Bye to Your Pet&quot; fills that void.<br />In the first part of the book Laura Carlson discusses the five stages of grief, the five stages of healing, memorial services and memorializing your pet.

Solving The Puzzle Of Soulmate Marriage&quot; is a response to the high and climbing divorce rate in America.  It was conceived as the result of the difficulties that the authors had as a married couple and how they overcame those struggles.  After arriving at what they feel is a soulmate marriage they realized that the lessons they learned may prove helpful for other marriages.  From that idea the book was born.<br />The book does a good job of covering the most common relationship problems and offering constructive advice to move through those problems.  While there are many chapters on specific items, the book can basically be divided up into four primary areas (the areas referred to as &quot;corner puzzle pieces&quot;).  These areas are 1) point of view/perspective, 2) communication, 3) respect and 4) commitment.  Sometimes the book seems more like a workbook with exercises, checklists, skits and other teaching devices.  But going through the skits, exercises, etc. can be illuminating.  While there is really nothing new here that is not in other relationship and marriage books, some will find this a particularly easy to read and understand book compared to others.  No fancy theories or long drawn out psychological descriptions of techniques, just good, direct information and techniques that anyone can work through.	2002-11-12

With McPhee we learn to appreciate the fish as well as the hunt, we learn to stand is awe of those that are truly proficient at catching the shad, and even thrill in the pleasure of the catch.<br />Easy reading that artfully takes the reader into the mind of those who would wait all year for a few weeks of opportunity to seek and catch the American shad. It is truly a wonderful piece of prose that is so well written that even those who do not engage in the art of fishing find the book a fascinating read.  A highly recommended read and a fine example of one of the most engaging writing styles today.	2002-11-12

A Drummer's Philosophy of Life at Eighty&quot; is basically Sam Ulano's musings about life and the important lessons learned over the years.  It is his system for personal happiness and reaching your goals.  Much of the advice is pretty much common sense, but then again we all know that common sense often appears not to be very common at all.  With that in mind, there is definitely a place for a book such as this.<br />It is not filled with the trite sayings and theoretical advice that is common to many such books, but has practical items that anyone can do.  If other books give the goal with comments such as &quot;to be happy you have to not be sad&quot;, then this one gives the steps.<br />Most of the advice is written from a musician perspective with items such as &quot;Stay on Top of Your Practice&quot;, but still that can be applied to anyone engaged in activities that require skill.  Some items are for encouragement (Don't Believe Those Who Aren't Tops in Their Fields) and others are real life (You'll Pay the Price Even If You Don't Pay the Price), but all are valuable if you can see how to apply them to your life and your needs.<br />Although not particularly organized well it is still a fine list of what is needed to be successful in life along with complete explanations of why each is important.  If you didn't have a wise grandfather to turn to for advice when setting out on the road to life, take Sam Ulano along and learn from him some of the most important lessons in life.	2002-11-12

In &quot;Stronger in the Broken Places&quot; he takes his knowledge and experiences and develops a plan for dealing with disaster.  His experience has taught him that there are four critical times when you can deal with an emergency.  The first is to anticipate it as a possibility and prepare for it.  The second is once you understand it you can make plans to prevent it or mitigate its effects.  The third is when and how you respond to the emergency.  And the last opportunity is during the recovery phase.<br />&quot;Stronger in the Broken Places&quot; clearly explains how businesses, communities, or even individuals can work through a potential crisis.  Thorough in its coverage of crisis management, it starts with examining your company's values since everything you do will have to be based on your company value system and priorities.

This book is specifically made for the person who likes to explore areas that are still predominantly in their natural condition.  If you are looking for a landscaped park to hike through then you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for places where you are likely to see endangered species, the only air conditioning may be a breeze, and you may see very few people (if anyone) during your hike then this is the book you are looking for.<br />Some places are truly remote and you may be on your own finding your way around  (like the Florida Everglades) and some are less remote and may even have boardwalks through the forest to make your trip easier.  The book starts with an extensive overview of everything you need to know about southern Florida - weather, what to wear, animals and plants to be cautious of, information on the various park systems, and anything else that you might have a question about when planning a trip.<br />One of the nicer features of the book is a section on the various habitats that you are likely to encounter in south Florida.  The author does an excellent job of explaining estuaries, coral reefs, cypress stands, mangroves, marshes, hammocks and other habitats.  She covers what qualifies them as a specific habitat, what you should look for and expect in each of them and general educational information on each of them.<br />She then covers special wildlife and unwanted pests before moving into the Federal Lands part of the book that actually starts the information on each site.  When she gets to the specific sites she provides all the information that you will need to plan a trip there.  She covers the local habitats you might find, wildlife, facilities, and complete contact information (worth the price of the book by itself).<br />A highly recommended read for those who think camping equipment should not involve the word Winnebego.wildlife, facilities, and complete contact information (worth the price of the book by itself).<br />A highly recommended read for those who think camping equipment should not involve the word Winnebego.	2002-11-11

To say that he has learned not only the details of the program but also how to impart that knowledge to a reader is an understatement. Throughout the book he explains what he is trying to accomplish with a project, how he is going to accomplish it and then walks you through the process. The end effect is that you actually learn how to use Photoshop 7 to create the effects that you want.<br />Feature rich and full of examples, it covers the basic and advances features of Photoshop 7 in detail.

For example, digital products come and go so quickly that the consumer must make a decision as to which companies they believe will exist in the next few years.  After all, a five-year warranty is of no value if the company folds in two.  Will the company be around and supporting their product in three years when technology has changed?<br />This is the focus of the book, in the area of digital products what produces the momentum that makes consumers purchase the particular vendor's product?  The authors conclude that what makes consumers purchase and companies survive in this industry is momentum.  And momentum is a function of Mass, Speed, and Direction.  A digital company must create mass, develop speed, and set direction.<br />Customers buy from a company that is perceived to have momentum because they have a fear of ending up with a product that is no longer supported or completely orphaned as a competitor establishes itself as the industry standard.  Part of the problem is the conception that digital products are never finished.  There is always an update, patch, add-on or newer version of almost any software or hardware that has any sort of digital component.  So, how do you develop and use momentum so that the consumer believes they can confidently purchase your product without fear?<br />The evaluation of a digital product for most consumers is evaluated differently from non-digital products.  For non-digital products the consumer has traditionally focused on the features of the product.  For digital products the consumer typically evaluates a product not by the features but by how it will make their life easier, more productive, or more entertaining.<br />The major part of the book discusses the six forces of differentiation and the effect they have on the purchasing decision.  For each one of them the authors show how to create them and use them to create momentum.  An excellent book on the unique marketing factors of digital products it is a highly recommended read for anyone manufacturing or selling digital products of any kind.it will make their life easier, more productive, or more entertaining.<br />The major part of the book discusses the six forces of differentiation and the effect they have on the purchasing decision.

In the &quot;Zondervan NIV Study Bible&quot; Zondervan publishing has produced the ultimate study Bible for the average user.  I will admit that I have always been a fan of Zondervan Bibles because of their quality and organization.  I have used the Zondervan King James Cyclopedic Bible for almost thirty years simply because it was the best study Bible that I could find.  This NIV Study Bible is a better study Bible in many respects (although I will still be keeping my old one).<br />The Bible contains thousands of study notes throughout the text.  The notes are organized at the bottom of each page so you don't have to go to another section of the book to cross reference notes to the text.  The notes also contains icons next to each of them so that you will know at a glance about the type of note.  For example, a small trowel icon indicates that the note is about archaeological information.<br />Each book has an introduction and outline just before the book so you can quickly get a feel for who wrote it, when, and why.  They also have all the features that you have come to expect in a quality Bible, center column verse cross references, words of Christ in red, etc.  In addition there are many, many features that make this a quality source for study.  For example, a chronological chart that shows how the different book, people, and stories of the Bible fit in with world history, multiple maps, an index to maps, charts, diagrams, subject and study notes index, etc.<br />In short, this is unquestionably one of the best reference Bibles on the market today.  If you are looking for a Bible for serious reading and study then you could not do better than the Zondervan NIV Study Bible.	2002-11-11

The definition of wealth can be quite different between different people.  For one it might be monetary riches, for another it might be the free time and money to persue goals, and for another person it might be something entirely different.<br />The author points out that some people seem to acquire wealth easily while others seem to be continually chasing wealth without ever actually acquiring any.  The difference between those that are successful and those that are not is often their mental attitude.  Is it enough to be positive?  Is it enough to regularly research options?  The author argues that these things are not enough.  It requires a mentality that leaves the person receptive to opportunities as they come along and able to act on those opportunities.  Throughout the book the author teaches how to change your belief system and program yourself to automatically become aware of opportunities as they come along, how to maintain that system, and how to develop a plan to actually move toward your goals.<br />While it does not cover any aspect of finance, investing or similar parts of wealth generation, it is a very good book on the mentality required as a precursor to getting and keeping wealth.	2002-11-04

It may not be easy, but it is there.<br />The other group that would probably benefit from this book would be those that have recently come out of a domestic violence situation and are still in the healing process.  Healing can take a long time and the book provides encouragement to help them heal.<br />This is a great book to use as a starting place for a serious discussion of domestic violence with children, teenagers just starting to experiment with relationships and those who are in, just out of, or know someone in an abusive relationship.<br />I did find something disturbing about the book but had a really hard time putting my finger on what it was.  So, I asked a couple of people that had been in those situations to read it and give me their thoughts.  I also asked a couple that had been in such a situation and now were happily married.  The ones that were out of such a relationship but now happily married also found something disturbing about the book but could not figure out what it was.  Finally we sat down and figured out what bothered us about the book.  There is absolutely no positive male image in the book at any point.  The picture of the rescuing angels are all female, no indication of a male fairy also out in the light and helpful and supportive.  I can accept that people in that situation may have lost their faith in members of the opposite sex and need to trust only people of the same sex while they heal.  That makes this book an excellent read for them.  However, for those that have not been in those situations or have come out and are now healed it is more of a good jumping off point for a serious and animated discussion of the problem.<br />A very small book that takes a maximum of 30 minutes to read, for those that are in a violence situation and starting to wonder about the relationship, it could be a wonderful read and is highly encouraged.  For anyone else, it is better as a discussion starting point.cellent read for them.

An extensive exposition, it examines the historical factors that brought us to where we are now as well as the myths and assumptions that are part of that history.  The author also examines current research in the area and how that information points to both the fallacy of many of our assumptions as well as a direction to a more positive approach for the child(ren).<br />The book is written in an easy to read style and the arguments are presented well.  With such a complex subject and so much evidence to present, if the author had included it all in the text it would have rendered it a burdensome book to read.  To overcome this the book is heavily referenced and annotated at the bottom of the pages with some pages having more area denoted to annotation than to the actual text itself.  In addtion, there are several appendices in the back with verious reports and studies.<br />This is a book that should be read by all of those involved in the family practice area of law - judges, lawyers, psychologists, social workers.  If you are really concerned about the children of a broken marriage and not driven by vendictiveness then this book deserves a solid read.	2002-10-20

What about when you do the same thing?  We all have a tendency to do this.  Or what about when that small inner voice tells you that you should or should not be doing something?  Do you listen?  For a deeper more meaningful relationship both with others and with yourself you need to be able to listen and listen well.  Listening is not the same as hearing.  Sometimes I hear crickets at night, but I am so used to it that I have to actually stop and listen to really hear them and enjoy it.<br />Listening then is one of the key factors to positive, healthy relationships with others, yourself, your God, nature or whatever you want to have a relationship with.  True listening requires practice.  It requires slowing down and not responding immediately to a question but stopping to listen to how you really feel about the question.  It requires a recognition that silence is just as important a part of a conversation as is speaking.<br />&quot;The Sacred Art of Listening&quot; contains forty meditative reflections about listening.  For those who meditate deeper or better with an anchor on which to focus, each reflection has a mandala illustration on which to focus.<br />The author states that there are basically three qualities of deep listening.  First is the recognition that silence is important.  You can't listen if you are talking, even if you are talking inside your own head and planning what you will do later that day.  The second quality is reflection.  To listen well you have to reflect on what was said and what it means.  What are the nuances of what was said?  Was what was said the same as what was meant?  The third quality is presence.  You cannot listen well if you are not there.  If your mind is somewhere else you are not present and therefore are not listening well.<br />Listening needs to be a part of a person's life if they are to have deep, meaningful relationships.  The book is an easy read with well thought out reflections that are concise (two pages each) and yet insightful.  A recommended read.>Listening needs to be a part of a person's life if they are to have deep, meaningful relationships.

People with a high IQ based on standard IQ tests may or may not do well in life.  That has made theorists wonder if there is another way to measure intelligence.

One of the basic premises of the book is that emotions come and go and when they rise up they are meant to flow through your body and out.  However, that is not the case for most of us.  For whatever reasons many emotions become stuck in us instead of flowing through.  When this is the case, &quot;It is not possible to go back and change what happened.  We can only change the way we feel about it.&quot;  That is where this book becomes a helpful guide to releasing those long forgotten emotions that cripple us in daily life and cause us to do things that are not in our best interest or just plain keep us from being happy.<br />Through a simple process the author leads the reader a specific technique of recognizing those feelings, honoring them, and then using sound as a mechanism to release those unhealthy feelings.<br />As a result you feel free of these constraints to your happiness, more free and spontaneous and are able to lead a more fulfilling and happy life.  What's that you say? Using sound, or vocalizations to release stress, emotional stresses and the like sounds a bit strange?  To many people it does sound strange, but it is well documented that music can make a tremendous difference in our attitudes towards life, stress levels, feelings of contentment, etc.  So many older cultures have used vocalizations to reach places of contentment and peace whether it be the &quot;Om&quot; of eastern religious mediations, or the chants of Native Americans to achieve altered states.  If vocalization and sound can be used successfully to achieve such altered states then it is reasonable to believe that, if used correctly, it can be used to release emotional baggage from our past allowing then to then flow freely out of our bodies so that we are free of them.<br />Although this is a small book it is still wonderful reading and many will find it very useful to help move them toward a happier life.  So, now the alarm clock is ringing.  The question is whether you hit the snooze button and continue your life as it is currently or wake up and take action to change how you perceive past harms so that you can go forward in peace.

Try the biscuits and gravy for breakfast (preparation time of about 15 minutes) or the Dijon Chicken and Mushrooms for dinner (preparation time of about 30 minutes) or perhaps the Cheddar Potato Soup (preparation time of about 15 minutes).<br />If you find yourself often in a hurry and trying to put together a delicious meal in a short time then you will not be disappointed in this book.  Granted it takes a lot of short cuts to get you to the end result with a minimum of effort, but it does not sacrifice taste to do so.

A highly successful chain that was founded in late 1940's, it set several precedents that are still followed today by most specialty chains.<br />But this was a time when a woman working outside the home was not totally accepted, a woman at the head of a successful corporation was pretty much unheard of, and the average retail store lasted only three years.<br />The author starts with some background on her family and her childhood.  She follows that with how and why she started the clothing chain and then delves immediately into the ups and downs of the business.  From the first small store that was so small it would only allow one customer in it at a time while others waited outside, to 104 stores, it is the story of strength, perseverance, and common sense.  An encouraging read for anyone in business for themselves or thinking about it, it is a recommended read.	2002-10-15

In this book he is ready to try being \\"Mr. Helpful\\" and focus his energy is positive manners.  The problem is figuring out how he can help everyone while still moving forward with his life.  His parents fight regularly and engage in dysfunctional actions, his homeschool partner is a blind girl who is full of mischief, and her fundamentalist mother has a total inability to deal with reality as every contact is focused on \\"What Would Jesus Do\\".  His Grandma wants him to have a good friend other than his dog and seems to be the only one really concerned about the Joey within.  However, she is dying and won't be there for him very long.<br />A real survivor, Joey's story is one of struggling and perseverance that pays off in the end.  A story with several twists and turns it can be humorous reading.  The greatest value of this book would be for parents to read the book and use it as a springboard for discussion of kids with ADHD.  It teaches some things about children with ADHD as well as some aspects of how to deal with them.  However, the book should be used as a catalyst for family discussion to prevent misconceptions.  Before writing this review I let two fourth and fifth graders read the book to see what they thought of it.  I found that they were getting some wrong impression from the book.  It seemed that they thought that Joey's antics were in large part due to his family problems and that kids with ADHD all had dysfunctional families.  Joey is a kid who tries as best he can to do the right thing and struggles through his problems to rise above them and that is a good story, just be careful of inappropriate inferences that children can make.  It is a great platform for opening up a discussion about children with ADHD.	2002-10-15

Continuous giving without taking time for yourself leads to exhaustion, frustration, and burnout.  The book has some self-assessment exercises that can be used to help determine the type of giver you are.  Do you give expecting something in return or do you give without expecting reciprocation?  Do you take on more than you can do because you find it difficult to say \\"no\\"?  Do you give so that you will be recognized for your giving or do you give silently without requiring recognition for your gift?<br />Once you know the type of giver you are the authors lead through several ways to change your giving patterns to ones that are more holistic in nature.  Give authentically, give from the heart, give wholly, but learn where you have to draw the line so that you can continue to give in the future.  In a society where we are taught that to give to yourself is selfish many people find it hard to take care of their own spiritual and emotional needs, but if we don't then our value to others is decreased.  It is only by taking care of ourselves that we are able to truly help others.  This is the basic message of \\"Give to Your Heart's Content\\" and it couldn't be more true.

Well, of course, eventually some explorers leave their islands and meet others with different views.<br />Very easy to read even for very young children and written in a poetic style typical of young children's books it is a delightful read.

In &quot;Mastering Windows XP Professional&quot; he takes on the monumental task of documenting Windows XP Professional for the new and experienced Windows user.  Because it focuses on both experienced and new users, the first section has detailed instructions for such mundane tasks as starting Windows XP, opening programs, minimizing and closing screen windows, etc.  From there it moves to more and more advanced topics as he teaches you the details of the system from beginning to end.<br />One of the problems with a book of this size and ambition is determining the goal of the author and from there determine if the book meets that goal.  To this extent, the title &quot;Mastering Windows XP Professional&quot; should cover the details of the operating system.  In this text Mark Minasi at times gives too much detail on items that are, and should be, covered well in other books (for example, HTML programming) and at other times properly keeps the coverage at an overview level because there are exhaustive texts available (for example, Windows Scripting Host or configuring IIS).<br />The book does what it promises in allowing a new or experienced user to master Windows XP Professional without trying to make them an IT, Networking, or Integration professional by covering many topics outside the realm of the basic XP operating system.  Also, as is common with Minasi's books, this is not designed to be a study guide for certification but a reference for real-life users to deal with and resolve real-life problems.<br />Does this mean that this is the definitive text on Windows XP Professional?  No.  While it is an excellent text, it does not rise up to the level of Mark's other books.  There seems to be a pattern developing in his works.  For example, &quot;Mastering Windows 2000 Professional&quot; was somewhat disappointing, but the second edition became the definitive text.  He is obviously listening to what people say about the books and incorporating their comments into the second and successive versions.<br />All-in-all it is well worth the money and a great reference book.  It is well organized and covers several areas that are skipped over or minimally covered in other books.  For example, Internet Connection Sharing is better documented here than in any other text I have seen to date.

In a society where only the bad young people make the news, it is refreshing to have a book that shows there are those that are making a positive difference.<br />The second portion of the book is an instructional guide and handbook for anyone who wants to follow the path of the young people in the book.  It is full of detailed suggestions on how to organize, plan, and carry out programs for social change.<br />A must read book for teenagers and adults these people and those like them are our hope for a bright future.	2002-09-23

The first part of the book goes through her history and how she developed such an antagonistic attitude toward church and religion.  The rest of the book allows the reader to follow her through her growth process.  Most of her growth process seems to be based on &quot;writings&quot; where she sits down and just starts to write things that come from deep down in her soul where one's higher self resides.<br />She stresses that this was her path that she took and that it may be very different for others as we all have our own path to follow.  The final portion of the book is a collection of her &quot;writings&quot; organized in the natural order of the growth experience, from &quot;The Call&quot;, to &quot;The Path&quot;, to &quot;Self-Knowledge&quot;, to &quot;The Struggle&quot;, to &quot;The Soul's Mountaintop&quot;.<br />Strongly New Age in format, many traditional Christians and other fundamentalists will have a lot of problems with many of the concepts in the book.  Others that embrace the possibilities of New Age thought will find it a delightful and inspiring book.	2002-09-23

The whole concept of first aid for the mentally ill seems to have eluded the medical establishment until now.  Written for the lay person to help them understand the signs, symptoms and early intervention techniques, it is an invaluable resource.<br />Initially the book covers three basic frameworks within which first aid is possible.  These frameworks are represented by the acronyms CARE, HELP and HEAL.  CARE is the initial response and stands for Checking for the presence of the mental illness, Anticipating possible complications, Remedy with early intervention, and Educating yourself about the illness.  EAL framework depending on whether you are the caregiver or the patient.  The HELP paradigm is for caregivers.  It stands for Help patients through the basics of first aid, Empathize generously, Listen actively and Prevent yourself from getting sick.  HEAL provides the framework for a patient.  It stands for Help youself through the basics of first aid, Encourage yourself, Address the issues and Learn to cope.<br />After discussing these basic frameworks the book goes into the basics of mental first aid followed with developing coping skills to deal with the illness.  Then the rest of the book deals with applying the techniques to specific conditions including depression, mood swings, panick attacks, phobias, obsessive and compulsive problems, trauma, anxiety, psychosis, dementia and others.<br />Filled with various scenarios to help you learn how to recognize and deal with the ilnesses and concluding with an extensive section on Resources and References it is a valuable guide for  everyone.	2002-09-18

Not only does the author present the tenets of &quot;Present Moment Awareness&quot; but also walks the reader through a series of exercises and techniques designed to help you achieve that state.  The bottom line of living in the present moment means that emotional baggage from your past and/or concerns about the future are not allowed to destroy your bliss of the present. If you want to achieve peace and bliss in your life &quot;Present Moment Awareness&quot; is one of the best ways.  Too much time is spent thinking about things that occurred in our past or worrying about what might happen in the future.  In concentrating on our past or future we lose the time that is passing by right now.  Once the present is gone it is the past.  The only time we really have to choose how we will live is the present.  The past is gone, the future not here yet, so live in the present, which is the only place you ever really live.<br />A great book to help anyone learn to accept life and live for today, it is a highly recommended read.	2002-09-18

Still I moved from 450 words per minute to just over 650.

For example, she has an excellent essay on dealing with the death of a child.  How would you feel?  How can you be truly helpful and understanding if it happens to a friend.  Digging deep into the reality of the situation, she offers positive, effective wisdom.  How long should it take for the person to recover and get back to a normal life?  There are no rules, some may not take but a few months, others may not recover for years, some may not recover at all.  The chapter defines how to be a real friend.<br />Other essay subjects include solitude, friendship, listening, generosity, alcohol, betrayal, psychologists and other mental health providers, etc.  Throughout the text her values come shining through - commitment to family and friends as well as responsibility for your behavior.<br />Strong, effective and yet sensitive reading, it is highly recommended to anyone interested in improving themselves or their relationships with friends and family.	2002-09-18

The book starts with some basic concepts of E-commerce and how it differs from other web sites as well as basic instructions for getting a site up and running.<br />From that point on, the book not only continues to educate about E-commerce but also walks you through using the software to create a working website.  The software included with the book, GoDaddy's WebSite Complete, uses templates and wizards to walk you through the creation of a complete E-commerce site.  Without any knowledge of HTML coding you can create a site with credit card processing, shopping carts, hit counters, scrolling marquees, and even catalogues.  The book even walks you through the process of establishing a merchant account so you can immediately verify credit card purchases.<br />The last part of the book covers how to manage the site after you have it up and running.  This includes tracking shipping, gathering statistics, making changes, and common problems and how to solve them.<br />Of course my usual caveat about websites applies here - Just because you can do something does not mean that you should.  Although it can be used to put up a very nice website, the software has enough bells, whistles, images, backgrounds, etc. that you can easily put up a terrible website.  The problem is that too many people want to include everything they can onto their site.  As a result it becomes an unmanageable mess.  If you are serious about putting up an E-commerce site then you owe it to yourself to also pick up a book on good page design such as \\"Web Pages that Suck\\" or \\"Son of Web Pages that Suck\\".<br />Ideal for small business owners, individuals, or anyone on a tight budget that wants to put up an effective E-commerce site, this book is a recommended read.	2002-09-06

Many parents of teenagers feel that their world has suddenly been invaded by creatures from another planet.  What once was a well-behaved child has suddenly become a disrespectful, obnoxious creature with no consistency or logic whatsoever to their behavior.  Anthony Wolf takes us on a wonderful trip to their planet to help us to understand what is going on in their world and why they act the way they do.<br />Sharing the knowledge that he has accumulated over years of counseling, he shows us that, believe it or not, teenagers often do make perfect sense!  With a witty writing style he shows deep insight into why teenagers act the way they do, why girls and boys generally deal with teenage feelings differently, the perils and problems of each and how these fears and feelings manifest themselves in the teenager's actions and language.<br />Filled with positive advice such as knowing when you have won and need to stop instead of continuing a battle, how to pick your battles, and how not to get sucked into a battle that really has nothing to do with the subject being discussed.  Some of the most important points that he makes includes the fact that it is a temporary situation and soon they will be past the teenage years, you will not make the right decision every time and it is okay to make a wrong one, and what you do now does make a difference even though it does not appear to have any effect right now.<br />A highly recommended book for parents who want to understand what their teenagers are going through and how they can appreciate and help them through those difficult years.	2002-09-06

It focuses extensively on the viewpoint of the company that wants to establish a 401(K) plan. How do you establish the plan? What are the fiduciary responsibilities of the plan administrator? What are the consequences of various choices? How should you compare plans to determine the one that best fits your needs? I've read other books on 401(K) plans and they generally seem to focus on just a few of the subjects treated in this book. Many focus on selecting a good plan, but often don't provide the information on how to determine an appropriate ratio of growth, income, risk and other factors. Others focus on the design and implementation of the plan without providing any guidance on how to benchmark a good plan. This book, on the other hand, is very comprehensive and yet is written in a manner that the average reader can understand and apply the concepts. If you are responsible for selecting a company plan, selecting the funds to be in the plan, design of the plan, or any other aspect of a 401(K) plan then you owe it to yourself to read this book. \\"Smart Choices\\" is a complete reference to understanding a 401(K) plan from overall concepts to the details of whether it is performing as it should be.	2002-09-05

It is the story of Babla and her experiences as she meets outer and inner guides and works her way through the problems of her past.  In actuality it reminds me less of a fairy tale and more of the powerful, life changing metaphors that Milton Erickson used to create to help others heal themselves and work through problems.  It is no surprise then to find that Rabia Erduman is not only experienced in psychology but also hypnotherapy.<br />While the author states that Babla's tale is the story of her journey to self-discovery and growth, the path is a familiar one that will provide insight and assistance for many people.  One of the reasons that people are often haunted by the past and cannot seem to escape is because the subconscious understands things only in the form of symbols.  By embedding the symbols into a fairy tale the end product is a story where the very act of reading it and mentally going along on the journey affects the inner self of the reader.  By the end of the book she fully integrates the best portions of all that she has learned and can now live a full and happy life, unaffected by the chains of the past.<br />Definitely a new age book, with tantric principles, inner guides, outer guides, healing circles and similar items built into the story, readers from the highly conservative religious left will have difficulty with the book.  For anyone else it is a wonderful and insightful read.	2002-09-05

A short visit to the Clearbridge web site is all it takes to understand why.  Still, I wonder what I might be missing in the translation of the book.  In this particular book (the author has written several based on Sun Tzu's work), the left hand pages have each Chinese character with the translated word next to it so that you have a word for word translation.  The right hand pages contain a translation of the words into everyday English.<br />The problem with a translation of this style is one that has plagued translators for centuries and is the reason why there are so many slightly differing translations of Sun Tzu's work.  If the author sees one Chinese character and wants to indicate the English word that this character translates to then what word does he pick?  After all we have a Thesaurus because there are often many words that mean the same thing or almost the same thing such that choosing one over the other automatically colors the translation.  What if there is no exact word in the English language?  Well, you have to choose the closest one and that affects the translation.  Sometimes words, even if translated exactly, do not give the whole essence of the concept in the original language due to cultural or other differences.  Translators can't even seem to agree on something as simple as Sun Tzu's name!  Is it Sun Tzu or Sun Tsu?  You will find it transliterated both ways.  With this in mind I was glad to see that the purchase of the book gets the reader access to the Clearbridge web site where they can see much more exhaustive analysis on the treatise.<br />Sun Tzu's treatise on The Art of War is really a treatise on competitive advantage that applies not only to actual war but such things as getting a job, marketing, and any other competitive situation that you might come across.  A deep understanding of competitive advantage, it is still the definitive text for understanding the concepts of how to come out on top in such situations.  An easy book to read and understand on a basic level, it can take a lifetime to truly appreciate in on all levels and apply it to the various areas of your life.  This translation still seems to be one of the best that I have seen.  It is internally consistent between the translated concepts and so shows a level of knowledge and detail that is not present in some other translations.  As a translator the author obviously sees the big picture.nderstanding of competitive advantage, it is still the definitive text for understanding the concepts of how to come out on top in such situations.

Why the sequel?  Well actually two reasons. First is that new techniques have been developed and new software designed that allows the web page designer to do things that were not possible when the first book was written.  Second, is that you just can't anticipate all the possible ways that someone will create new and attrocious web pages.  It seems that so many web pages are created by putting as much technology as possible onto the page without any concern for the user and how they might use the page.  However, just because you can is no reason to add a particular item or effect to your web page.  I can stick my finger in my eye, but that doesn't mean that I should.  Still, that seems to be the most common design technique around, put as many things and special effects as possible onto the page until it becomes impossible to actually use.<br />Sound like a problem of the man web sites put up by amateurs?  Sure, but it is also a problem of multi-billion dollar companies.  I know of two colleges that point to the web sites of at least three multi-million dollar companies as examples of the worst web pages on the web.  So, how do you make your web site an exception to the rule?  The first place to start is with this book.  By examining many, many web pages with terrible design problems you learn what to look for, what is appropriate, and what is not.  Mr. Flanders even shows that there are exceptions to every rule and when some techniques might be appropriate for a particular site that are not appropriate for others.<br />If you want a useable web site that keeps people coming back and is a joy to use, then you must start with this book.  If you want to know what things aggrevate the user and cause them not to return to your site, then start with this book.  It's not about what you can do on a web site, but what you should do to reach and keep your intended audience.  Developing a good web site starts with good, useable design and good useable design starts here.  A must read for anyone interested in web design.ence.

While there are no new techniques presented, it does provide an overview of the various memory methods (loci, peg, phoenetic, etc.) and how each one is used.  There is one difference in the phoenetic method presented here and the method as traditionally taught.  The method taught here is easier to use with lists of less than a hundred items but would be more complex with larger lists.  Still it is an interesting variation.  This is not instant memory, but does provide the listener with the tools and techniques to remember anything you have a desire to recall.  Within ten days you can gain enough knowledge to have a substantially better memory.

While often very scientific in nature, the essays are still written with the layman in mind.  The author does not give a deep, in-depth discourse on complex scientific theory such as quantum mechanics, matter, space, time, big bang theory, and the mathematics of extremely large numbers, but still explains enough that the reader can understand the point being made.<br />While normally a very fast reader, I found myself purposely slowing down to make sure that I gained a complete understanding of each chapter.  I found myself often stopping to consider a point and contemplate the consequences and logic of the analysis.<br />Under Newtonian ideas of the universe everything was logical and predictable.  This is not the case today.  Many experiments have shown that the Newtonian laws break down completely when dealing with atomic and sub-atomic particles.  As physics and mathematics have shown the importance of various relationships and the probabilities that they might occur by chance calculated the end conclusion is that the universe required for our existence should not exist and yet it does.  Now more and more scientists have come full circle to agreement that the universe was created with us in mind.<br />While many of these concepts defy science, it seems that they do not defy the Torah.  The Torah can be interpreted to include such concepts as multiple universes, space and time fluctuations, etc.  The end result is that no insurmountable conflict exists between the Torah and science.  In actuality the Torah now seems to be the one that was far ahead of its time and science in now finally catching up.<br />A very highly recommended book for anyone dealing with concepts of science and religion being in conflict with each other.  Read the book and see how the new science is validating the old beliefs.old beliefs.	2002-08-25

Dr. Hartman divides people into four basic personality types and describes the types using a colors metaphor.<br />People who fall into the red category are motivated by power.  They need to influence others and are totally dedicated to causes that they believe in.  Reds are strongly opinionated and have no tolerance for stupidity.  People who fall into the blue category are motivated by a desire for intimacy.  Intensely loyal and always seeking a purpose in life, Blues are cautious with their emotions and tend to be neither happy nor sad but just existing from day to day.  Whites are motivated by a desire for peace.  Strongly empathetic and tolerant, Whites mix in well with any group and will tolerate just about anyone in order to avoid conflict.  Yellows are focused on fun and pleasure.  They are naturally happy people and relate well with others regardless of ages, social status or occupation.  A defining trait for Yellows is that they always need a way out or a chance to escape and run free.  They have a large number of people that they associate with but very few true, close friends.<br />Dr. Hartman also discusses how to determine which personality type a person falls into.  Once you know a person's color type you can understand why they act and react the way they do .  Unlike many other texts on personality theory this one concentrates not only on what traits the person has but on what motivates them.  Many books describe how a person in a particular category acts, but few focus on why they act that way.  That is where this book differs.<br />An interesting book with a useful system for understanding people, I found it much more valuable for understanding what motivates certain types of people than more complex systems with sixteen or more personality types.

In &quot;Getting to Peace: Transforming Conflict at Home, At Work, and In the World&quot; William Ury, a world famous negotiator, brings his years of experience to the average person.  The book takes the view that conflict always has three sides, the two opposing sides and the third side which is that of a peacemaker.  Contrary to what most people might think, William Ury takes the position that conflict is not a normal part of human nature, so destructive conflict is not inevitable.  He proves his point well by pointing out that while conflict and strife make news, the basic human condition is peaceful conflict resolution punctuated by periods of strife and not strife punctuated by periods of peace.  Peace is the norm.<br />The ability to resolve conflict gives us the ability to choose peace in all aspects of our life, at home, at work, at school or anywhere else.

This ability is what has allowed the human species to move beyond simple logic into creative thinking.  It is what has allowed us to excel in arts, develop religious thought, create a language and engage in many other activities that required insight and intuitive thinking.  &quot;The Way We Think&quot; provides detailed  analysis of this blending and how it not only has affected our past but also how it affects us today.<br />Filled with numerous examples to help the reader understand the nuances of conceptual blending and how it works in various scenarios, it is a fascinating read.  This is not easy reading for those who are not at least somewhat knowledgeable in the area of cognitive sciences.  I would consider it a very valuable academic text but not for the average lay reader.  There are less complex books available on this subject that would make easier reading for the novice but this is one of the best academic level books available if you want a more complete understanding of conceptual blending and how we are able to blend concepts to create new levels of knowledge.  A highly recommended read for technical oriented people.	2002-08-19

Basically they were concentrated in the university communities of Glasgow and Edinburgh between 1720 and 1780.  This free thinking influence spread to the colonies where people such as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton were schooled by Scottish teachers.  A Scottish teacher, Francis Allison, taught three signers of the Declaration of Independence.<br />The Scottish teachers realized that all nations of the time were founded or maintained by force.  They suggested that a nation founded on commerce could be equally as powerful and influencial as those founded by force.  This set the stage for the development of the philosophical underpinnings of the United States.  All that was really needed now was a spark to set off the natural chain of events.  During the time just prior to 1776 there was a multitude of writings from Scottish authors that proposed and defended the notion that oppressed people have a right to assert their independence.  Between the strong writings calling for oppressed people to assert their independence and the belief that a country could be established based on commerce the scene was set for the establishment of the United States.<br />The author provides substantial and convincing background information on exactly how all of this worked together the help create the Unites States.  Details on what the Enlightenment was, how it came about and exactly how it influenced the actions of our forefathers and all there for the reader to learn and consider.  An excellent treatise on the often overlooked contributions of the Scottish people to the formation of the United States, I found it a very informative book.	2002-08-19

In the early 1700s the Scottish Enlightenment began and with it came a greatly enhanced understanding of our world and breakthrough philosopies in economies, physics and many other sciences.  From the economic principles of Adam Smith, and philosophies of David Hume to the inventions of Alexander Graham Bell and financial empires of Andrew Carnegie there seems to be no area of modern life where the Scottish influence was not felt.  In relation to other countries the people and contributions presented in this book show a disporporationately larger contribution by the Scottish society to our modern life than any other single nationality.<br />One of the significant contributions of the Scottish Enlightenment to the United States was the teachings of Hutcheson that oppressed people have a right to rise up against their oppressor and establish a free society.  In addition, many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were either Scottish or descendents of Scots.  In many ways the writings of the Scottish Enlightenment period formed the underpinnings for the basic philosophies of the United States.<br />Herman goes on with example after example of how the Scottish Enlightenment and the concepts born there significantly influenced the modern world.  A thoroughly fascinating read that kept surprising me with the magnitude of the contributions of the Scottish people to our modern world, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in history.	2002-08-19

Each chapter is easy to read in a single short sitting and so makes it appropriate for even the most harried and hurried of readers.<br />Through her experiences as a therapist and mother, Roni Bissett brings a wonderful and insightful approach to life.  The book is filled with encouraging words and insights.  I particularly liked the well chosen poems, quotes and other motivational and introspective comments dispersed throughout the book.  Basically, each chapter deals with one aspect of life, the stress of marriage, dealing with children, life-stages we all go through, divorce, remarriage, forgiveness, the importance of belief, self-image, and retirement as well as many other areas.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I knew from the beginning that it would be a source of introspection and guidance when I read the poem by Helen Mallicoat in the first chapter.  This is not to say that every chapter spoke to me, but many did as the author's writing style and insight reached down to the basics of life and living it fully and without any regrets.	2002-08-19

Each of the important components of good management is sectioned off not only by chapter but also by index tabs on the book so you can easily turn to the correct section when searching for an answer or advice.  The tabed sections include Vision, Goals/Action, Planning, Problem Solving, Leadership, Attitude, Integrity, and Innovation.  At various points in the book there are applicable quotes and other motivational comments to help keep you on track.<br />A quick reference guide to the basic fundamentals of good, effective management I would recommend it highly for anyone new to management or who has been promoted to management by working their way up in the company with no formal management training.  Not a book on detailed SWOT analysis and other high level management tools, it is still a great reference for the basics without which SWOT, Sigma Six and other high level tools would fail anyway.<br />If you want a book that cuts through all the hyperbole and gets to the point with the basics upon which everything else is built, then this would be an excellent choice.	2002-08-19

Definitely a New Age work with sections on such typical New Age areas as Out of Body Experiences, conversations with Ascended Masters and similar items, some will find the book wonderfully enlightening and freeing.  Others will find that it goes beyond the limits to which they are open to the possibilities when he moves to conversations with extraterrestials and similar items.<br />The bottom line is that if you are open to various aspects of the New Age philosophies, ideas and movements then you are likely to find it an interesting read and well worth the price.  If you are not open to the possibilities of New Age spirituality then you are unlikely to find it of any value.	2002-08-19

But instead of a large, cumbersome comprehensive Topical Bible such as Naves, the author has compiled those topics related to basic Bible theology into a much smaller and manageable volume.<br />For each category and subcategory the Bible is searched for relevant verses and those are listed within that subcategory.  So, instead of searching throughout the Bible for verses related to a particular subject such as baptism they are aready collected for you.  As expected, it presents the author's theology and supporting scriptures.  Many people and groups differ on the interpretation of various verses and thus we have all the various denominations of today.  Still, the author does focus on the most important of basic Bible doctrines such as salvation, the Holy Spirit, Jesus, love, forgiveness, prayer, faith and others.<br />A well designed book that is easy to use,  I highly recommend it for anyone seeking knowledge of the Biblical basis behind many doctrinal beliefs.	2002-08-19

After a brief introduction into Posture-Movement Therapy he provides a section on how your back works, the physiology of the spine, discs, joints, etc. and how this relates to your posture, movement and back problems.  Bruce Kodish covers everything that you need to understand in order to safely use the techniques on yourself.<br />For myself, I was having some problems with discomfort in my upper back and used the appropriate technique in the book.  I found that I was able to completely relieve the problem.  I would have liked more specific techniques and specific excercises for different situations, but then again it had all I needed to help myself so maybe it is complete. If you are having back pain problems and are tired of the constant regimen of pain-killers or the regular onset of back pain you owe it to yourself to read this book and see if it can provide the same benefit to you that it did to me.	2002-08-19

But instead of a large, cumbersome comprehensive Topical Bible such as Naves, the author has compiled those topics related to Happier Living into a much smaller and manageable volume.<br />For people who are not familiar with a topical Bible, a topic is given (such as anger, beauty, critcism, or friendship) and verses related to that topic are all placed together underneath it.  As a result you end up with a collection of verses related to the topic.  I have Naves and a couple of other topical Bibles, but I really appreciate the way that this book contains only verses related to creating a happy life.  Well designed and easy to use, it is a book of encouragement and Bible study that anyone can use.  I highly recommend it for anyone seeking Biblical based knowledge and study on happiness, relationships, and personal problems as well as personal growth.	2002-08-19

The extremely powerful stories show how forgiveness has allowed individuals to regain their lives after severe tragedy has entered their lives.  Instead of taking the easy path and allowing anger and hate to destroy them, they make a choice that results in a deep peace.  Pick up the book, learn to forgive, learn how it is necessary for true peace, choose the road less travelled and choose forgiveness.  If there is a book that should be required reading for everyone, this is a contender for that book.	2002-08-19

It gives a detailed description of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) and how to use them to gain control over emotional problems such as fear, anxiety and addiction (as well as most others).  That's a pretty tall order for any book to try to fill and especially so when so many different fields of psychology and self-help can't seem to agree on how to deal with emotional problems.  It seems that a therapy that works for one person does not  work for another person.  So, how does this book try to fill the order of a simple system that anyone can learn and apply to help with any emotional problem?  It does it by pointing out that emotional problems create certain definite changes in the body that can be treated with accupressure.  So, the author takes you on a tour of accupressure points and techniques that change your body's reaction to the emotional stimulus and in doing so take the power away from uncontrolled emotional reaction.<br />The EFT techniques allow the user to treat themselves with a system that can be done quickly and privately at any time and in pretty much any situation.  Working from the smaller problems, in order to gain experience and confidence, to the larger ones the techniques are detailed and include a troubleshooting section to help determine what to do when things are not progressing the way they should.<br />Well written, organized, easy to understand and easy to implement, it is a fascinating read.

Install the software (I had no gliches or problems with the installation) and you can follow along with the book to design and produce your website.<br />Web Studio is a software product for beginners with now knowledge of programming, but it is deceptively powerful.  With a little imagination you can have a professional looking site up in no time.  It does not do the fancy Java based interactions and similar items, but it does do all that you need.  If you have ever read Web Pages That Suck or Son of Web Pages That Suck then you know that having the ability to do something does not mean that you really should.<br />The book walks you through the process from beginning to end but I would suggest combining this book with one of the two others mentioned above if you really want to make a great web site.  With the book and the software literally anyone can put up a web site overnight without any knowledge of coding.  A real winner for the small businessman who needs a professional looking web site but does not have the budget for a professional designer or the individual who wants a professional looking personal site.	2002-08-14

With divorce so easy to come by and people entering into marriage with the concept that if it does not work then they can just get a divorce, it is refreshing to find someone who openly discusses the realities of marriage.  Marriage requires committment, work and real personal growth as well as concession and recognition that people come into a marriage with their problems and quirks.<br /><br />Drop the expectations of perfection and come to surrender to the fact that all marriages have problems.  The grass is not greener on the other side.  When you divorce and enter into a new marriage you bring the same you into the new marriage.  The measuring stick of the perfect marriage is not that it has no problems but how the couple deals with their problems.<br />This does not mean that all marriages can be or should be salvaged.  There are situations such as abuse or life-threatening situations that may require a much more drastic course of action.  While the author is full-force in favor of working through problems in a marriage, she does recognize that some situations require drastic action for your own protection.<br />Full of actual interviews and real life situations, the book is insightful and to the point.  Not only does it discuss the real life problems of marriage, but also the real life effect of radical actions such an extra-marital affair.  Did it harm the marriage?  Did it provide the excitement sought?  Did it really provide a solution or even more problems?  No sugar-coating of the truth here, just the cold, hard facts.  While it is true that some marriages have more problems than others, Iris Krasnow's discussion of the realities of married life should be read by everyone contemplating marriage or married people contemplating a radical action.  A highly recommended common sense, reality based book.based book.	2002-08-14

Never seem to get everything done?  Perhaps one of the contributing factors is clutter.<br />Gaylah Balter provides an insightful treatise on how clutter, in all of its forms, affects our lives.  Whether it is a<br />cluttered desk, cluttered house, a cluttered room in the house or even a cluttered mind trying to keep track of too many<br />things, clutter is around us everywhere.  Using a system based on Feng Shui she leads you through the process of uncluttering<br />your life and returning to a more relaxed state.<br />She also discusses some of the reasons why people keep clutter and how it gets out of control, but best of all she offers<br />a framework for how to change yourself and get out of the habit of cluttering up your life. Very practical, useful ideas,<br />in a well written book, it was generally a joy to read.  I say &quot;generally&quot; because while it is filled with useful information<br />and written in a wonderful, clear style, that style is often broken up with attempts at humor.  I found it<br />added an amateurish quality to a book that was very professional in every other aspect.  If you can<br />ignore such high school comments as the &quot;Ha, ha&quot; in, &quot;I hope it hasn't become as overwhelming as your clutter is; that was<br />not my intention. Ha, Ha.&quot;, then you will probably find it an interesting book.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great book<br />that would deserve a five star review if it didn't contain all the &quot;clutter&quot; of the annoying side comments.

Calleman weaves historical information with science, religious philosophy of various types, the pyramids, evolution and various other items to show how they are all related to the pattern of the Mayan calendar.  Since the Mayan calendar continues through the year 2011 it predicts the pattern of things to come.<br /><br />Interesting reading, it is filled with very scholarly research but at times it seems quite a stretch to make some of the items match up.

In the book Deak covers the problems, confusion, motivations and fears that are all a normal part of growing up female.  But more than just noting that they exist and their basis, she also provides practical advice on how to deal with the problems in a proactive and productive manner.<br />The book follows the expected logical pattern of moving from the basics of perspective through the normal growing up process.  First are the formative years, then preadolescent, then adolescent years.  Of special interest, she includes chapters on the special relationship between daughters and their mother as well as one on the relationship between daughters and their father and one of dealing with the normal fears and worries of being parents.  Each chapter has comments from girls at that age or referring to the subject of the chapter as well as the defining or &quot;crucible&quot; events that occur during that age or relationship.<br />If there were one book that I would recommend to anyone raising a girl in today's world, this would be the one that I would recommend.  It stands like a lighthouse warning parents of dangerous shoals and how to avoid them as well as offering guidance on how to help their daughters negotiate dangerous waters and come out safe.  This book truly lives up to the title and empowers parents with the tools to mold young girls into confident, courageous and well-adjusted adult women.	2002-08-01

Books	5	53	54	N	N	Great information, complete direction	The common conception about writing as a career is that it is difficult to get into and produces many &quot;starving&quot; artists.  While this may be true in many situations, Marc McCutcheon argues convincingly that it is not necessarily the case when it comes to nonfiction writing.  According to the author over 50,000 new books are published each year, but only about 3,500 of them are fiction.  As a result, most of the competition is in the fiction area.  The nonfiction area is by far the easiest one in which to become published.<br />The author relates how even a beginning writer can learn to write nonfiction and start making a living as a writer much faster than commonly believed.  The book is filled with the necessary details of not only writing a great nonfiction work but also how to handle contract negotiations, why you need (or don't need) an agent, writing proposals, marketing and just about any other subject that the writer may need to know.<br />Throughout the book, McCutcheon encourages the new writer and points out that many top selling titles were written by ordinary people without any special writing skills or training.  A book that should be on the bookshelf of all writers, I can't recommend it highly enough.	2002-07-29

Unable to read through the book in one setting, I found myself desperately trying to find ways to get back to it as soon as possible.  Who would have thought that you could take the subject of sexual reproduction and evolutionary biology and made it into such a thoroughly entertaining read?<br />The author chose an advice column format with letters supposedly from crickets, stick bugs, stickleback fish and dozens of other creatures asking advice about their sexual situation.  Needless to say most of it is fascinating and highly unnatural - for a human that is, but perfectly normal for them.  Some of the situations she describes are so bizarre as to be beyond what one would expect from even the best science-fiction writers.<br />Olivia Judson is to be applauded for writing an educational book that is so thoroughly entertaining that it does not seem like you are actually being taught in the process.  But you will learn and you will walk away with a completely different view of nature and reproduction.  I was so thoroughly fascinated with the book that all I can say at this point is \\"Encore, encore\\".	2002-07-29

With well defined animals that exhibit traits children can relate to, the characters work together to overcome all obstacles as they try to solve a mystery of a problem in their forest, try to stop the problem and then try to find an alternative place to live.<br />The story points out that different animals (or people) have different abilities but by working together they can achieve their goals.  The illustrations are very simplistic in nature but that seems to be one of the things that young children like, the illustrations look to be drawn by a young child like them.<br />A delightful book with good positive values, it touches on a wide variety of subjects that parents may want to discuss with their children.  A recommended book.	2002-07-29

One of the truly unique perspectives of this book is that it discusses and details the process of such a change.  Many similar books effectively argue the need for change but then provide no direction on how to make the change.  Thomas Wentz' book provides detailed discussion and processes for creating that complete transformation of your business<br />In the past most businesses were based on a mass production focus.  Success and management were evaluated on a numbers basis.  How much has sales increased?  How many items were produced during this period last year?  This numbers orientation tends to cause people to work hard to meet the numbers as their primary focus. In this scenario employees typically don't go beyond what is expected of them.  There is no motivation to create a unique world-class organization.  Add to that the fact that times have changed and customers now require a solution or product that is customized to their specific needs.  If you can't provide a customized solution or product then they will simply go to a competitor that can.  Is this just another business direction change?  Thomas Wentz argues that it is more than just a directional change, it requires a complete transformation of the business from one form to another completely different form.<br />A nice extra to the book are the numerous &quot;Key points&quot; scattered throughout the text.  By summarizing the prior information in just one or two sentences and making it stand out from the text it is easy to quickly read over the key points of the book and refresh your memory on an ongoing basis.  An excellent book on business and change that also has some applicability to personal change, it is a recommended read.	2002-07-29

There are ample examples of a species declared extinct but suddenly one is captured, found, or sometimes a dead one found (as was the case of the Australian night parrot thought extinct for many years until one was found as roadkill).  He also covers sightings of unknown creatures (Bigfoot, Loch Ness) as well as sightings of creatures whose very existence seems to depend more on the desire of the observer to see them than on anything else.  All aspects of this area of research are covered including current directions in cloning, captive breeding, disease, and even the effect of the political climate.<br />Travel with Weidensaul as he goes to the most remote areas of the earth in search of lost species and provides an inside look into this field as well as those who would dedicate their lives to resurrecting the dead and lost.

Have you ever wondered if there is another side to the stories that is just plain not being told?  Is it possible that everything you are being taught is not necessarily true but is instead just the position that the government, media or other group wants you to believe?  If you have then you owe it to yourself to read this book.<br />Just a couple of examples from the book include the current situation with Mad Cow disease in America, the fact that violence involving young people is at it's lowest level in over 30 years (despite the impression you get from the news), how French authorities kidnapped a girl in California and took her to France.  Other areas include nuclear safety, globalization, serial killers, the Vatican Bank, Olympic Games, the Columbine murders and many others.<br />While at times the book seems like a series of articles from a \\"conspiracy theory\\" group, it has the advantage of each article being contributed by an authority in that field.  The authorities include everything from investigative journalists to researchers to commentators and academic authorities.  Each article includes well-documented evidence to backup all claims.<br />If nothing else, you owe it to yourself to learn the alternative possibilities and explanations that are out there, most of which are at least as plausible and sometimes more so than the \\"official\\" or \\"accepted\\" version.

Mr. Burchett starts with an example from his own life involving his daughter.  She had a terminal physical condition that posed no threat to anyone.  However, the church decided that she was unwelcome in the nursery because of her problems.  Didn't Christ reach out to those in need?  Didn't Christ spend most of his time dealing with those who were outside the mainstream of society?<br />In a sad state of reversion to times gone by it seems that the modern Church has a lot in common with the Pharisees of old.  Don't disturb our status quo, don't do anything that might make our nice, pretty church not look like the best one in the community.  Not only does that apply to the physical church but the people of the church also.<br />I have attended several churches with the problems mentioned in this book (unfortunately far more seem to have the problems than do not).  From one that wanted the teenagers to participate in taking up the offering but only if they could get a nice suit jacket to ones that would forgive and accept any repentitant sinner into their group but would not forgive a repentitant member who made a mistake.<br />While Burchett's criticism of the church can be caustic, he never makes a point that he does not backup with a real life example and then also backs it up with specific Biblical concepts.  If you have been injured by the church or know of others that have been then this book is for you.  On the other hand, because we all are human and at various times commit many of the sins covered in this book, it should be required reading for all Christians.	2002-07-11

The second section is on how to resolve tough negotiating problems.  The third section covers how to use pressure points in negotiation.  Then comes negotiating with non-Americans followed by attitudes and beliefs of a power negotiator.  Section six covers developing power over the other side and section seven covers the various drives that motivate people in a negotiation.<br />Simply one of the best books on negotiation, it is a highly recommended read and should be kept near at hand for the occasional review whether to assist you in dealing with the car salesman, the children, or anyone else you deal with.	2002-07-11

After reading through it, I sat down in front of the television, watched several modern shows and found the plot line for every one of them in the book.  I flipped over to HBO and again found the storylines for each of the current movies in the book.  This is not to say that the book will help you write a story, it helps only with the very basic plot line.  A lot of would be writers lacking imagination will have a hard time with this book because it does not write the story for you.<br />Several years ago I was deeply involved in the study of magic tricks.  At the time I had an old-timer tell me that there were no new tricks, only new ways of presenting the same old tricks.  I did not believe that at all because of the wonderful new tricks that David Copperfield and others performed.  As I learned the secrets I found that he was indeed right.  New methods were extremely rare, almost every \\"new\\" trick was actually a masterful change of the surroundings, distractions, story line, etc.  This book is the same sort of thing.  It will provide you with the various changes and movements through a good story line, but it is up to you to provide the background and breathe life into the plot so that it becomes spellbinding.<br />In the hands of a skilled writer or anyone with a strong imagination this book can provide thousands of combinations of plots and subplots from which to springboard into a wonderful piece of fiction.  A recommended book for any serious writer with a decent imagination.	2002-07-11

He proposes that conflicts generally follow a basic recipe.  The ingredients in the recipe are fear and a perceived loss of respect.  If people don't act or react the way we expect then we fear a loss of control.  When we fear a loss of control or perceive that there has been a loss of respect then our self-esteem is injured and we follow our first reaction to a loss of self-esteem, we fight back by turning it into anger.  If this is the source of the emotional factor in conflict then the solution is to provide the other party with the ability to regain self-respect and at least some sense of control.<br />How to give this sense of control and self-esteem back to the other party is the focus of the book.  Lieberman takes you step by step through many scenarios so that you can learn how to adapt to a situation and proactively make peace with anyone.  Whether it is dealing with a long-standing conflict or stopping a problem before it gets out of hand, the book is filled with useful and practical techniques that are sure to dramatically change your relationships with others for the better.  A highly recommended read.	2002-07-11

For those who are not familiar with the basis of Kinesiology, the basic theory is that all living things have an energy field.  This energy field is connected to all other energy fields in some way or another.  In short, we are all connected to each other in some way.  Nothing we say or do or that has been said, done or felt occurs in a vacuum and so has an effect on energy.  Because of this, everything that is or was is written into an energy record of the collective unconscious.  The problem is how to access this information. This is where David Hawkins and his research comes in.<br />Through thousands of scientific experiments David Hawkins and others have found that muscle testing can be applied to determine when a field is positive or negative and things that change those fields. What makes Dr. Hawkins' research different is that while most kineseologists have worked with the individual and concerned themselves with how an individual's fields change based on their views, he has worked with determining the truth of information that is not known to the individual.  How could this work?  If everything is written into this collective unconscious then we all have access to it, we just don't know how we do or how to do it purposely.  Enter Dr. Hawkins' methods for how to access information on anything that has happened or is happening even if you were not a party to the event yourself.  Since you are accessing the record of the collective unconscious it only applies to things that have happened or are happening and not to any future event.<br />Written in a style that makes a fairly complex topic easy to understand and follow, the book is an easy read, but demands close attention to the details.  A recommended book for those interested in such things, I will have to admit that I tested out some of his comments and found that they were surprisingly accurate.	2002-07-11

He advocates a writing style is direct, clear and crisp.  He divides the book into four sections: The Principles, Methods, Forms and Attitudes.  Probably the best parts are the first two.  The Principles covers keeping your writing simple, removing clutter, writing for the audience, word choice and usage.  The Methods covers things such as unity within the writing, the lead and ending and various other aspects of writing methods.  The section on Forms covers various specific writing techniques and styles for different forms of writing.  Specifically it covers areas such as the Interview, Travel Articles, the Memoir, Business Writing and Technical Writing.  If you have a specific need for one of these forms then the section has some very good advice.  Finally the section on Attitude covers the required Attitude of the writer.<br />Throughout the book you learn that writing is indeed a craft that can be learned.  Zinsser points out the most important patterns and techniques of successful writers so that you can follow their lead.  This book is still one of the most recommended texts for people just beginning to learn to write and with good reason, it should be on the bookshelf of anyone serious about writing.	2002-06-22

A reader tends to skim the page looking for words of interest and if they don't find what they want then it is easy to just click an link or hit a search engine and go to another page that might be of interest.  In Web Word Wizardry the author leads the reader through the snares and pitfalls of writing for the Web in a style that demands attention and is directed towards a goal - getting the reader to actually examine the page.<br />By far the most comprehensive book that I have seen on this subject, Rachel McAlpine works through not only Web Pages but also writing and style for Ezines, writing for Search Engines, using Keywords and similar items.  She ends the book with a checklist for Meta Tags, Title Tag, Description, Body Copy, Links, Optimization, Micro Content, Skim-Reading, Clarity, Adapting for the Web, Credibility, and Profitability.  The checklists are well worth the price of the book by themselves.<br />With plenty of examples throughout the book it is clear and concise and a valuable reference to onyone designing a web site, Ezine or other Internet communication medium.  If you want your site to be professional and user friendly then use this book as a magnifying glass to evaluate your site.  Highly recommended.	2002-06-22

While he does cover several important areas and cover them well, I have two areas where I thought the text either belabored a point far beyond what was necessary or left out a point that was very important.<br />The belabored point was on the definition of a cult.  Zender discusses the fact that the very activities that many Christian groups use to define a cult are the same activities that they engage in.  While his points are well made on this front some of them also suffer from problems with his analysis.  For example, he accuses the Christian religion of meeting several of the aspects of the definition of a cult as espoused by Bob Larson in his book.  The problem is that Zender applies these to point out that the Christian religion as practiced today meets these traits of a cult.  For example, he accuses the church of meeting item two of Larson's definition which states that cults alter the diet of those who follow it.  They do this by \\"depriving one of essential nutrients and enforcing a low-protein diet\\" which \\"can lead to disorientation and emotional susceptibility\\".  He then points out that they use dozens of cookies at Vacation Bible School and so meet this criteria.  Well, so does a typical day care center, many Grandparents offer cookies, ice cream and other items to the grandchildren, etc.  As a matter of fact the typical parent would fit just about every factor for definition as a cult according to Larson's book.  I felt that Zender wasted my time with Chapter Six on the discussion of how the church today fits the bill as a cult when the problem is the definition of a cult as espoused by Larson would make almost all families cults.  The definition itself is defective so why use it?<br />For the most part, the rest of the book was excellent and points out many of the problems of the church as it practices religion today.  Accurate and filled with Biblically based arguments, it is a very good read.<br />On the other hand, it misses one of the best reasons to quit church (while not quitting God).  That reason is the perfection expected from the church.  I find it very hard to swallow that so many churches would forgive and accept anyone as a member if they would ask for forgiveness and join their church.  On the other hand, if someone who is a member of the church makes a mistake then they are much slower to forgive and much more likely not to forget.  For example, I once attended a church where a young, unmarried girl wanted to find new direction in her life and join the church.  She was welcomed into the youth group and encouraged to join other activities with the youth.  Then one of the young ladies who was already a member of the church and youth group became pregnant.  She was told that she could no longer be part of the youth and since she had made an adult decision she would be included on the role of the adult classes and was no longer to have any involvement with the youth activities.  With that sort of perfection expected if you join a church then why would anyone want to?  Once you are in then you must be perfect, something that even Apostle Paul was unable to attain.<br />Don't get me wrong, I like the book and would recommend it.  The chapters on God does not live in Boxes, the Church digs People into Spiritual Ruts, and the Church binds People to clocks and Buildings are insightful and excellently argued.  Taken as a whole it is a good read and can cause the reader to see things in a different light that is based on truth instead of institution.  An excellent book that is part of what are probably the three best books on the problems of the church today.  The other two books would be \\"Messy Spirituality\\" and \\"When Bad Christians happen to Good People\\".  Every Christian who realizes that something isn't quiteright about the way the Christian religion is practiced today should read these three books.ite right about the way the Christian religion is practiced today should read these three books.	2002-06-20

Among other things General Semantics focuses on the fact that what we perceive to be fact and reality is only a portion or one aspect of true reality.  By opening your understanding to more fully grasp all of reality it opens the doors to deeper understanding, happiness and better communication in all areas of life.<br />At several points the authors refer to \\"Science and Sanity\\" by Korzibsky.  This was the first authoritative text on General Semantics but was written in a very technical style that most people would find very difficult to follow and digest.  All the major points of Korzibsky's work are included here in a much more readable style that allows the reader not only to understand the concepts but to actually start applying them right away.<br />An excellent book for those who are interested in bettering their communication with others, NLP students and other communication professionals, as well as those interested in General Semantics, it is a recommended read.	2002-06-20

The book focuses on one of the things most lacking in many people's lives today.... balance between career and personal life.  Instead of spreading yourself thin among all the things that you have to do, the book leads you through techniques to determine the focal points in all areas of your life.  Then with this focus you can change your life and achieve more in the areas that are important to you while gaining control and peace.<br />I really liked the fact that this is a no nonsense book.  I have read other books that espouse similar ideas but part of getting control of your time is to use it wisely.  I really appreciate that this book is not filled with fluff and motivational stories, but is direct and to the point.  This makes it one of the best reference books on the market today for regaining balance in your life while focusing on achieving your most important goals.	2002-06-20

If you've ever dreamed of owning your own business but don't want to be tied down to a brick and mortar building, then this is the book for you.  Starting an Internet business could not be easier with the help of the information provided.  The book starts with interview information from three successful Internet businesses and then follows that with how to get your point across, the various formats for a storefront, required features of the successful storefront, payment options, and levels of e-business.  From there it moves to helping determine what is important to you and how to use that to find the right business for you.  From there it moves to the profiles of successful businesses.  These profiles are complete with how to market the business, startup costs, skills needed, online examples, etc.  It finally concludes with information on how to build your site, get it submitted to search engines, e-mail marketing, using links and pretty much just about everything that you need to know in order to get the business up and running.<br />Susan Sweeney, the owner of an international Internet firm, has produced a very thorough and easy to understand book.

Why would you want to learn this method?  Actually that is easy to answer, other than classical piano pieces, most piano players use this method and it is the easiest method to learn.<br />Scott Houston teaches you to play in this style and has you playing your favorite pieces in just hours of practice instead of weeks and weeks of learning to read notes and painstaking lessons.  You will not learn classical concert piano techniques, but you will learn to play your favorite pieces with confidence.<br />If you just want to learn to play piano for the purpose of having fun or entertaining at a party or playing for a pop, rock, or similar group then this is a wonderful guide.  If you want to learn classical piano then it is not what you need.  Absolutely the easiest method and a lot of fun, I enjoyed the book greatly.... and can actually play a few tunes after about four hours of practice.	2002-06-10

One of the key points is that most golfers don't put the ball where they want because they concentrate on hitting the ball.  As an alternative they should determine the position that their body and club should be in at the end of a successful stroke and swing to that position.  They call this the Swing to Balance.  Determine where you need to end up and then do what you need to get there.  Too many companies focus on hitting a target, getting a particular client, meeting numbers, protecting investment, etc.  These are ways of focusing on hitting the ball.  When you do that then you may hit the ball but it generally does not go where you want it to.  By Swinging to Balance you hit the ball as a normal secondary result while reaching the primary goal.<br />Another key factor is dealing with change.  As you develop a habit of hitting the ball a certain way your muscles retain that memory and it becomes comfortable for you to swing that way.  Any other swing will make you feel awkward until you get used to it.  Organizations face the problem of dealing with this muscle memory when they try to realign the company towards the goal of Swinging to Balance.<br />If you are a golfer then you will appreciate how the parallels are drawn between golf and business.  If you are not a golfer then you will still see the points that are made and learn from them, but perhaps miss some of the nuances of the comparison.<br />I know a lot of people who do business on the golf course, this would be a highly appreciated gift to most any of them.  What a nice way to say that you not only enjoy golfing with them but care about their business.  I don't know that I would have purchased this book off the shelf for myself (not a golfer), but having read it I do know of a couple of clients that golf regularly who I would consider purchasing a copy for as part of good marketing to them.	2002-06-10

I looked at several other texts that were larger but seemed to contain a lot more fluff instead of actually useful information.  This book was excellent for learning Perl and CGI starting from complete ground zero.<br />Within hours I was creating and testing scripts and actually wrote one to do what I needed done.  I also downloaded another script that would not work and was able to troubleshoot and fix it to do what I needed.  An excellent book that walks you through the steps one item at a time it was easy to understand and work through.<br />One of the things that this book contained that I did not see in other books was instructions on how to download, install and setup a personal server so that you can test the scripts you write as you learn.  This information alone makes this book superior to most others.  There is no better learning environment than being able to actually write and test the scripts.<br />Some HTML knowledge is assumed, however it is very little.  Picking up a basic HTML book allows you to quickly come up to speed with the knowledge assumed.  On the other hand, the required HTML knowledge is easily obtained from various sites on the Internet.<br />I could not recommend this book highly enough for anyone who needs to learn Perl and CGI basics and needs to get up to speed as soon as possible.	2002-06-10

What makes her experiences unique and of interest to others?  First, she is a resident doctor with a rare congenital disorder.  After suffering for years of painful infections and operations she learned to control her problem with monthly infusions and interferon injections.  Here is a doctor who has been living the patient experience all her life, from her early childhood, through school and medical school and even now as a doctor.<br />The book discusses her dealings with her condition as well as how it affected her life choices and outlook including her decision to take control of her own destiny by becoming a doctor.  A book of courage and determination in the face of obstacles, it is a light read through her life that can be inspiring to all.  One thing that makes this book different from similar books of courageous people is that almost all other books have an ending.  The person succeeds, the person conquers the problem and moves on, etc.  In this case her condition will not be cured, it is a lesson in real life that sometimes there is no end to a problem, only courage to make it the best it can be and go on about life - a good lesson for all of us to learn.	2002-06-09

It is not an exposition about the beliefs of various religious groups nor what defines a cult from a religion or any such thing.  Instead it deals with an all too common problem, people basing their understanding of a group on prejudiced things they have heard, gossip or similar information.  It deals with the alienation that often follows when parents and friends don't understand why a person joins a different religious group.  It also deals with how to recover that communication and recover the relationship.<br />This book guides you through various techniques to deal with this situation.  The first and foremost is to be calm and find out about the group for yourself.  There are various ways of doing this and the book covers all of them.  It also covers the things not to do in a situation like this.<br />This book is a definite recommendation to anyone seeking guidance on how to deal with someone else's religious choices or anyone who may be thinking of making a change themselves.	2002-06-09

From the time of Copernicus to Galileo to Darwin and beyond, science has continuously raised questions about ideas of belief and then answered the questions in a manner that does not require religious belief.  Religion has taken a beating more and more at the anvil of science.  The problem is that science and religion have always treated each other as being mutually exclusive.  You believe in one or the other.<br />While this book does not prove God exists, it does a very good job of showing that science and religion do not have to be at opposite ends.  Science has advanced over the last 25 years to the point where the best explanations for some things are that a guiding hand has been at work.  The position that if you believe in science then you cannot believe in God is shown to be untenable.  This does not prove that God exists, only that there is no real obstacle standing between science and belief in God.  Not an argument for a particular religion or a particular God, it points out that belief in a guiding intellect that pervades the universe is a tenable position and also the position most consistent with the current state of science.	2002-06-09

Often there is a big hole in our lives where a relationship once flourished.  Feelings are hurt, opportunities lost, time passes and more special times are missed because of the estrangement.  When do you find that enough is enough?  When you have decided that the cost of the estranged relationship is too high, how to you go about reconciling?  What if the other person is not ready to reconcile?  How do you bring peace back to your life?  These are all valid questions and here, finally, is a book on how to deal with these and other questions.  Here is a book that details how to get past the barriers and start onto that road to reclaim that which was lost.<br />The book is filled with examples of minor differences that have caused complete separation to the much more serious problems of estrangement due to child abuse and similar very serious problems.  She details her process of reconciliation with her mother after not speaking for ten years.  She also details how others have moved to the point of reconciliation and what they have done.  She starts by pointing out that all the knowledge that she had gained over the years was not necessarily correct.  Must you forgive the other person first?  Conventional wisdom is yes but she gives examples of people who have reconciled without forgiveness.  Do you have to discuss the issue completely and get everything out in the open?  Conventional wisdom is yes, yet she gives examples where reconciliation was possible only because they agreed not to discuss it between them.  We are not dealing with a cookbook where you can say the process of reconciliation is step one, step two, step three.  We are dealing with people and emotions and what is required for reconciliation is whatever the two people involved require.  Reconciliation is a very personal process.<br />What types of reconciliations are discussed?  Reconciling with a drunk driver who killed your child, a man shot by and then reconciled to his assailant, a young man who vandalized a church because of highly charged ethnic feelings but was reconciled to the church members.  Extreme examples that sometimes are hard to understand how a person can rise to that point of reconciliation.  But the world is a better place because people can.<br />The last of the book contains a simple test that the reader can take to determine if they are ready for reconciliation.  Part of the process is based on being ready to reconcile and having the common ingredients that make reconciliation successful.  These common ingredients include time, maturity, discernment, compassion, honesty, determination, courage, listening and accountability.<br />If you are entangled in an estranged relationship or know someone who is then this book should be required reading.  If you are ready to reconcile a relationship but dont know how then find the courage in the examples in this book.  If the cost of being apart has become too great then learn how to quit paying the costs.  An indispensable book for those who are ready to move on with their life after an estranged relationship or those who want to help prevent an estranged relationship in the first place when possible, it is a highly recommended read.ho killed your child, a man shot by and then reconciled to his assailant, a young man who vandalized a church because of highly charged ethnic feelings but was reconciled to the church members.

This instructional book is filled with not only some of the most direct and useful advice but with example after example to illustrate what solutions to the problems discussed.<br />The text illustrates how sometimes just changing a few sentences or even a few words can completely change the level of interest of the reader.  He shows how to lead the reader down one path and then surprise them with a sudden change, or how to keep them guessing where the author is taking them, or even how to take them down a path they expect but work it in such a way as to arouse their curiosity or emotions in ways that they did not expect.<br />This is a detailed writers workshop in book form.  It covers everything from how to develop a character, to designing plots, how to get the reader's attention and how to manipulate their emotions to want them to always continue to the next page.

Why does there seem to be so many different views and different ideas on how to best invest?  Of course risk is one of the biggest factors as is how much time you are willing to put into analysis each day.  Some people are comfortable with a lot of risk if the potential reward is a really large gain, others are not.  Some enjoy watching the stock tape cross their computer screen all day long and watching their investments, others are to content to watch their investment progress on a monthly basis.<br />Reese and Glassman examine the most respected investment advisors today and detail not only their philosophy but also the level of risk the investor should be comfortable with and the level of effort the investor needs to put forth to follow that person's advice.<br />Each expert is analyzed one at a time including the criteria they use for investing, how they determine if a stock meets that criteria or not and examples of individual stocks with an analysis of where they pass and fail the selected criteria.  The analysis is detailed and yet straight forward so that someone with minimal experience in stocks can understand the basis philosophy.<br />Who are these investors that are analyzed?  Only the most revered names in stock investng:  Peter Lynch, Benjamin Graham, William O'Neil, Warren Buffett, The Motley Fool, David Dreman, Martin Zweig, Kenneth L. Fisher, and James O'Shaughnessy.<br />Most of the experts selected have written their own books on how to invest.  This book distills down all the fluff and long winded information in the other books to a single chapter on each advisor, a chapter with all the information required to follow that person's style.  So, I guess you have a choice, buy several books and read them all or buy this one and get all the knowledge as well as a detailed step by step plan of how to follow their investing style.

In this book he discusses the techniques, motivation, training and other factors necessary to excel in the world of sales.<br />At first it appeared to be yet another book on how to sell, repeating the same concepts as other similar books.  However, as I read through it I became aware that there was something different about this book.  Some of the information was more up to date and some of it had different nuances that I had not been exposed to but there was still something else that made this book different.  Finally I realized what it was.  The book is a study of how to grow a sales superstar.  Looking at it again I realized that it starts with the basics of committing to excellence moves through becoming a sales consultant and dealing with objections and ends with managing your territory.<br />The chapters are actually organized in a logical order that portrays the growth of the sales person as well as the process of making the sale from beginning to end.  As a result, even though about eighty percent of the book is nothing new, it is a really useful book that helps put the jumbled advice of other books into perspective as a total process.  Figure out where you are at on this continuum and you can figure out what you have to do to move to the next level.<br />If you've read a lot of other sales books it is still worth the price just for this level of organization and insight.  If you are just starting and looking for ways to become a superstar then start here.  It may be all that you need, but if it is not then it at least establishes an organized total framework in which to work and understand other books and/or courses.	2002-05-16

It would be impossible in a brief review to convey the depth of understanding and clear vision of God and spirituality that this book conveys.  If you are a Christian and in your Mary Poppins world think yourself to be practically perfect in every way, then this is not the book for you.  For everyone else, including those who need to deal with perfect Christians, this is one of the best books that I have ever read on the subject of Christianity and spirituality.  The focus of the text is to challenge one of the most insidious practices of the church, the expectation of perfection among its members, rituals and procedures.  Through personal examples Michael Yaconelli illustrates the true grace of God and how it should show through in all the ways we interact with others.  If you have been taught to berate yourself because you are less than a perfect Christian, this book is a breath of fresh air that truly frees you from those chains of what you \\"should\\" be.  I have read many books on Christianity, theology, Bible Studies, etc. and many of them have been excellent, but if there were one book that I would recommend above all others this is the one that should be in every Christian's hands.	2002-05-09

One of the most important things that it teaches is knowing when to keep your mouth shut and just listen.  Sometimes just listening is the most critical part of a healing conversation. Sometimes we struggle so hard to find the right thing to say that we don't listen to what they are saying.  Often if we had just listened to what they were saying we would have known the appropriate thing to say.<br /><br />Excellent advice that anyone can use, it is divided into sections entitled \\"When you need a friend\\", \\"Health matters\\", \\"Healing conversations at work\\", \\"Transitions\\" and \\"Lost loves\\".  While these are fairly broad categories, they are subdivided into detailed sections that cover just about every situation you might come across.  From putting a pet to sleep to helping children understand illness to being fired or retiring the book is complete and reveals a dept of understanding and empathy not easily found in such books.  A highly recommended read.	2002-05-09

Rethinking the Past in a Changing World	Books	4	14	18	N	N	A view of the relationship between history and historian	What constitutes history and how it should be told has become an increasingly significant question over the years.  How events are portrayed in history texts often is more the result of the social climate at the time or the purpose of the writer than actual fact.<br />Part of the problem with history is that as new facts are discovered and new perspectives proposed history is rewritten.  Different groups offer a different perspective to the traditional perspective.  So, we now have black history, women's history, etc.  However, these same historians must deal with a fickle public whose primary interest in history has traditionally been that it be told with a particular purpose in mind.  When the Constitution states that everyone has a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness we are taught that it means literally everyone.  However, history has at times excluded American Indians, Black Americans and others.  Particular areas of the United States have excluded the Irish, the Catholic, the Polish, the Japanese or any number of other groups.<br />This book contains nine essays by Eric Foner, a professor of history at Columbia University, that were prepared for various conferences and book introductions.  In these essays Foner examines how the historian interacts with the history and their surroundings and how that interaction determines their perspective on history.  It includes essay on Mr. Foner's personal life as a historian and the things that influence his perspective.  Others include essays on modern Russia and post-apartheid South Africa and how they are rethinking their past in view of the current changes.  Probably the most interesting essays are in Mr. Foner's area of specialization - slavery, the Civil War and post-Reconstruction America.<br />An especially interesting read for those who are not familiar with the controversies of traditional history, it is a good read, logically argued and recommended for early college level students or higher.  For most of the essays the writing is slightly above the level of the average high school student.For most of the essays the writing is slightly above the level of the average high school student.	2002-05-09

Dr. Gawande exposes the myth of doctor perfection and replaces it with a compassionate look at the humanity of surgeons.  Of course this comes at the price of a loss of confidence in surgeons or at least a heightened sense of concern when someone you know goes into the hospital.<br />Do surgeons make mistakes?  They learn and practice on people and as part of that process they make mistakes.  So should you use only experienced surgeons?  What if they are not up to date on a newer and safer technique?  They still have to learn and practice them.  Where will our next generation of experienced surgeons come from if no one would use the less experienced ones?<br />These are tough questions that must be answered.  It is easy to say that surgeons need to practice on people and should be encouraged to while under the supervision of a more experienced surgeon, but what if it is your child being operated on?  Gawande even shares his experiences as he had to deal with this situation.<br />A thought-provoking and revealing book it will educate and entertain.  For people who want to see the human side of the surgeon's profession it is a recommended read.	2002-05-09

Not just theoretical in nature, the authors detail the process in a very easy to understand and implement manner.  The examples are detailed and to the point allowing anyone to follow the process.<br />Whether trying to turn around a business in trouble, keep a current one ahead of the competition or determine a business strategy for a startup, the book provides top quality guidance.	2002-05-09

The authors' contention is that addiction is a coping mechanism that people develop to deal with life's stressful situations.  Instead of doing the 12-step program the solution is to develop alternative coping skills.<br />Addiction is a symptom and not the disease.<br />Peale argues that treatment for addiction should be based on learning skills that allow the addicted person to cope better, communicate easier and relate to others better.<br />One of the more interesting points of the book is the analysis of people who try to kick an addiction without going through a 12-step type program.  Statistically, untreated people have the same or better success rate as those in treatment.  The author make a very strong case and argues it well.  This should be required reading for anyone dealing with an addiction or who knows someone dealing with an addiction whether it is drugs, sex, food, shopping or whatever other addictive behavior they may have.	2002-04-27

It is one of the best books and compares to the likes of Mark Minasi's works.  As the title indicates, this book concentrates strictly on the networking services of Windows 2000.  It covers all the typical items of DHCP, DNS, WINS, etc. in a very organized and detailed manner allowing you to quickly setup the services and get it right the first time.  It does an excellent job of explaining how the services work with each other and the problems an administrator might encounter.<br />Although not designed as a test preparation book, the book could be used for that purpose.  In my opinion it is much better than a test preparation book that tells you what answers to put where on an exam, it is a real-life problem solving book with the answers to the questions that you will have in reality instead of on an exam.<br />There is one more thing that is unique about the book and publisher.  When you purchase a Syngress title you are given a unique warranty against content obsolescence as the result of vendor upgrades.  If there is a vendor upgrade and you need to get the new information or changes to the information then you can download chapter updates directly from the Syngress web site.  In addition you can sign up for monthly mailings of customer questions and the detailed explanations.  Finally, you get a free membership to Access.GlobalKnowledge - an information source for IT professionals.<br />What a deal!  An excellent book, a warranty against becoming outdated three months after you read it and access to an informative and helpful web site.  This is a book that should be on every administrator's bookshelf and the extras just make it an even greater value.	2002-04-27

Generally, it is not that we actually see those relationships but through the influence of media, family and friends we are taught that the ideal relationship contains certain particular traits and anything less is not good enough.<br />Schwartz looks at twenty-five myths about relationships and how they keep you from achieving a happy and contented relationship.  Some of the myths she challenges are holy grails of what relationships \\"should\\" be.  For example, that your lover or mate should also be your best friend.<br />I don't agree with everything she says but she has compelling arguments for her positions and encourages us to challenge our preconceptions to see if they fit for us.<br />Not a deep book filled with psychological studies and analysis by any means, it is filled with practical advice and new ways to look at relationships.  A recommended read for anyone with a history of relationship problems, entering into a new relationship or just questioning the values that they grew up with.	2002-04-27

One of the most common complaints from women about men is that they don't talk.  This book is the result of years of getting men to talk and finding out what they would say, if they would talk openly.  Covering several areas from shame to sexual acting out, this is not a book about quick fixes but a detailed analysis of the psyche of men and what goes on under the surface.<br />Gratch breaks his analysis down to seven key attributes that you must understand in order to understand men.  First are the defensive attributes of Shame and Emotional Absence.  He explains how these affect a man's thoughts and actions as well as what can be done about it.  Then he discusses the four things that affect a man when he finally does open up.  These are Masculine Insecurity, Self-Involvement, Aggression, and Self-Destructiveness.  And finally he discusses the practice of Sexual Acting-Out.<br />An interesting and provocative book, some readers (mostly men) will have a problem with the analysis and some will find it enlightening.  Reasonably argued and filled with interesting insights, it is a reasonable analysis of how many men really operate deep inside.	2002-04-27

This book takes those concepts of Emotional Intelligence (EI) and applies them to successful leadership roles.  In doing so it moves leadership from an art form to science.<br />While it is not difficult to follow this book even if you are not familiar with his prior works, familiarity with the concepts would make the reading flow much smoother.  For this text he is joined by EI experts and co-authors Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee as they unravel the use of EI in the workplace.<br />The bottom line of Primal Leadership is that one of the most important tasks of a leader is to create good feelings in the people they lead. They do this by maintaining those same positive feelings in themselves.  In addition they have to create change, sustain change, and build an EI competent organization.<br />The book introduces the concept of \\"resonant leadership\\".  This is the tendency of employees to perceive the business environment in the same manner that their leaders do.  The moods, opinions, and actions of the leaders resonate to their employees and create the same feelings in them.<br />The top leaders develop four leadership styles and have the ability to easily change between them as needed. The book not only defines primal leadership but details how to develop and use these leadership qualities to make your business excel when others flounder.  A great read with a thought-provoking analysis, this book is required reading for those seeking to excel as leaders in their organization.	2002-04-27

In addition it breaks down those four areas into nine core factors that determine business success.  These core factors include Strategy, Judgment, Business Knowledge, Planning and Execution, Motivation and Courage, Leadership, Interpersonal, Communication, and Self-Management.<br />The organization of the information was logical and useful.  Some of the subjects covered include Strategic Advantage, Customer Loyalty, Sound Judgment, Thinking Strategically, Applying Expertise, Managing Technology, Planning, Managing Change, Influence, Coaching and Developing Others, Building Relationships, Managing Conflict and many, many others.<br />This is by far the most thorough and useful single reference book on managing that I have ever come across.  For ease of use it can't be beat with each section having it's own introduction and a list of the most valuable tips in that section.  Then to make it even more useful, at the end of the book is a listing of resources by chapter.  These resources include available books and seminars that relate directly to the items in that chapter.<br />If you are involved in business management pick up a copy of this book and keep it close at hand you will find yourself referring to it often.	2002-04-27

The guidance is solid and the writing style is easy to read.  These are the basic ground rules that everyone should know.  With sections that cover selling yourself as a speaker, in the classroom, in the job interview, as a product salesperson or even selling yourself in a confrontation or media interview situation, it covers pretty much all the bases.<br />There are more detailed books on persuasion and influence and using them to sell yourself, but this is arguably the best introductory text to the basics of selling yourself that I have read.  If you are new to selling yourself or the need to present yourself as credible in a classroom, court, or other situation then this is the book that you should start with.  Most of the books on persuasion and influence start a level above this one and assume that you already know this stuff.  Start here if you are trying to change your image or learning to deal effectively with customers, friends, relatives, co-workers or any other group.  Then graduate to one of the influence and persuasion books.  Even if you are experienced at selling yourself there is probably something here that can help you.  For me that would be the detailed section on facial expressions, something that I have not seen covered so well in any other text.  If you need to start with the basics to build a strong foundation or need to review the basics, then pick up a copy of this book.  You won't regret it.	2002-04-21

Instead of purchasing an advertisement in print media and hoping that potential customers will read it, or purchasing expensive television ads, the basis of buzz is to get friends, experts or other \\"hubs\\" to recommend the product or at least to talk about it.<br />How successful is a correctly implemented buzz program?  It continues to break sales records and speed the acceptance of new products in phenomenal fashion.  Often referred to as viral marketing, it spreads the same way a virus spreads, from one person to another, between friends, relatives, co-workers and any other social group that you belong to.<br />This book discloses the principles of buzz marketing, when it can be used, when it is not successful, how it has been most successful in the past and the basic principles that make it work or fail.  Thoroughly detailed with many examples, it is an excellent source of information on how to market your product or service in this manner.<br />Probably the best book available on buzz marketing, it is definitely the most thorough that I have come across.

Each item is organized into one of seven categories: 1) History and Politics, 2) Literature and Theatre, 3) Religion, Philosophy and Learning, 4) Visual Arts, 5) Music, 6) Science, Technology and Growth and 7) Daily Life.  Starting from 5000 BC and continuing to 1991, each area is shown in a parallel fashion so that you know which items were occurring at the same time in history.  For example, in the year 1838 in politics, Osceola, the Indian leader died and Queen Victoria was coronated, in Literature Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby were top sellers, in Visual Arts the London National Gallery was opened, in Science John Muir was born and in Daily Life the first traveling post office was opened.<br />If you have ever tried to fix an event in history in terms of what else was happening at the same time then this book is extremely useful.  If you are into genealogy then it can help understand what was going on in the lives of your ancestors.  If you are into science you can follow which scientists were contemporaries and what items were influencing them.<br />If you have any interest in history and want to get an overall picture of what was happening around the world at a particular time then this book can be a useful addition to your studies.  A recommended resource for those who are interested in such things I value it for it's ability to let me know what was going on during the time of my ancestors for my genealogy hobby.	2002-04-21

With thorough detail the author examines current research and examples to uncover how the tending instinct functions in today's society and how it explains the differences in how men and women respond to stress.<br />Most studies on stress and the \\"fight or flight\\" response that we have been taught since childhood have been based on studies of men and/or male rats or other creatures.  Shelley Taylor shows that that may be the case for men in general but for women the response is grouping together, reaching out to others, and \\"tending\\" each other.  Well researched, logically argued, it is a real treasure trove of insight.<br />The only thing that I did not like about the book is actually a comment more on today's society than on the author's writing style.  It is a shame that she feels the need to qualify so many of her comments, but she is probably right in doing so.  It keeps breaking up the flow of the writing to the point of being annoying.  For example, she writes \\"...women continue to be the mainstay of caring for children by a large margin\\".  That's an observable fact that I think most people would take as true.  However she follows it up with a parenthetical \\"...I do not mean that women should or must care for children or that only women can care for children, only that they are more likely to do so.\\"  It is a shame that in our politically correct society we have to be so careful not to offend that we need to sprinkle comments like this through a text that would otherwise be so well written.<br />Still, it is an excellent book and provides a different perspective on many issues related to tending and caring for others.  From the first chapter to the last, it is book that I would highly recommend and applaud the author for bringing such an insightful work to the public.  Bravo!ightful work to the public.  Bravo!	2002-04-21

There seems to be a multitude of beliefs as to exactly what happens in past life regression.  Is it real?  Is it something other than an actual past life?  Now to add more information to this debate and a whole different fascinating field of study, we have the work of the author Michael Newton, PhD.  Instead of just past life regressions, Michael has concentrated on what happens between the different lives?  When one life ends his studies begin and continue until the next reincarnation.<br />The book represents years of study and includes information from dozens of case studies.  The subjects covered include reincarnations, angels, ghosts, how evil people are dealt with after they die, soul mates and literally dozens of similar items.<br />With chapters on Death, Grief and Comfort, Earthly Spirits, Spiritual Energy Restoration it deals with many of the questions that people may have about the after life.  In addition it covers an advanced social system of souls that his research has uncovered.  That system includes Soul Groups, a Council of Elders, Community Dynamics, and the Ring of Destiny.<br />Well written and easy to follow, it is a fascinating read that some will find enlightening while others will find offensive and most will find somewhere in between.	2002-04-13
1581369:US	43546353	R34MOS0G5GLCQC	0500510504	729840444	The Seventy Great Mysteries of the Ancient World: Unlocking the Secrets of Past Civilizations	Books	5	22	25	N	N	Fascinating Read	I have always enjoyed books about mysterious events of the past, unknown civilizations, strange happenings, etc.  This book is full of such items.  The Seventy Great Mysteries of the Ancient World looks at some of these mysteries through the eyes of modern archaeology and other sciences to try to resolve at least some of the questions surrounding them. Each item is subjected to a scientific analysis of the knowledge that we have obtained to date.  Generally, the situation ends up being exactly what it has been in the past... an unresolved mystery.<br />Lavishly illustrated, it is written in a conversational style that is easy to read and understand. Logically divided into appropriate sections it starts with Myths and Legends, moves to Mysteries of the Stone Age, then to Ancient Civilizations, Tombs and Lost Treasures, Ancient and Undeciphered Scripts and the Fall of Civilizations.  The only thing that I did not like about the book was the short treatment of each item.  With seventy chapters (one for each of the mysteries) and roughly 300 pages that is only an average of four pages per mystery.  However, at the back of the book is an extensive listing of references to consult for further information on each of the items.  For those who like a complete synopsis of each mystery and the current level of knowledge this is excellent.  A fascinating book, it covered not only the mysteries that I was aware of but also many that I had never heard of before.  If there is one book that I would suggest to gain a basic knowledge of the greatest mysteries of the Ancient World then this one would be it.	2002-04-13

Easy to read, excellent writing style, it is a hard book to put down and begs you to read it slowly so that you don't miss something important.  One of the fun things about reading it is when the author makes a point and you can look back and realize that you have dealt with someone who used just that technique to get you to buy that candy bar, car, or change your mind about something.<br />Persuasive speaking is an important part of what I do and I am very successful at it.  The ability to persuade others has been very hard to pass on to employees and other speakers who have asked me how I do it.  This book allowed me to look at what I do and see how I can transfer that ability to others.  It has also helped me see some of the tricks of persuasion that snare the unwary and how they are used by unscrupulous people.<br />Cialdini not only makes his case by carefully presenting the techniques and the experiments on which they are based, but also details how they are used and how you can use them.  For each technique he also indicates how to know when it is being used against you and how to resist the influence.<br />A highly recommended book and one of the best on this subject, Cialdini's work is often quoted in other books on influence and persuasion.	2002-04-13

The book explains the concepts of Nonviolent Communication in detail with specific examples so that it is easy to understand.  The process itself is almost a spiritual journey as you move from a \\"get even\\" and \\"protect yourself at all costs\\" mentality to one of compassion and connection with others.  The book does a very thorough job of analyzing communication and all it's hidden facets.<br />One of the best books I have read on the subject of communication and how to grow and nourish your relationships with others, whether personal or professional.  A strong recommended read.	2002-04-13

I usually read a 300 page book in about two hours and am used to reading through them quickly and getting onto the next one.  This book was so fascinating that I slowed down to make sure that I got every bit of information out of it that was available.<br />This book should be required reading for everyone who wants to know how they are being influenced by the marketing people, unscrupulous sales people, cult leaders, governments and others promoters of influence.  It is a thorough course in how to spot an attempt to manipulate you and how you can analyse the situation to see if it is really something you want or not.<br />It has some of the most complete advice on how to examine an item and how to respond of any book on influence that I have read.  On the &quot;A&quot; list of must-read books.	2002-04-01

Through out the book it mentions Alzheimers and similar concerns and repeatedly speaks about not being concerned about particular memory lapses as you grow older.<br />It does have thorough coverage of memory myths and how some of these myths create or contribute memory problems as well as the best coverage of diet, medicine, supplements and similar factors of any of the memory books that I have read.<br />This is a workbook with many excercises to prove their points as well as show how various techniques work and how storing and retrieving memories works in the mind.<br />If I were asked who I would recommend this book to then it would have to be people in one of two groups.  First would be anyone who is aging and thinks that they are having memory lapses more often and are concerned about them.  Second would be those who want to know what drugs, nutritional supplements and dietary factors may increase or harm their mental capacities.	2002-04-01

Think using a dream dictionary is like trying to form a cohesive picture from a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle where all the pieces are cut exactly the same?  The Complete Dream Book takes a different angle on dream interpretation.<br />Based on a database of over 18,000 dreams, the author provides real-life interpretation of common dreams.  There are common dreams that occur during certain stages of life, at certain ages, and during certain changes and situations.<br />This book looks at these common themes in dreams and what they mean to the dreamer.  While she does cover common dream symbols such as cars, houses and the like, the fascinating part of the book is the common themes (can't get your locker door open or finding an new room in your home or finding a treasure, for examples).<br />This is the most useful and pragmatic dream interpretation book that I have ever read and I found myself regularly commenting about how appropriate an interpretation was for a particular dream of mine.<br />Kudos to Gillian Holloway for what has to be one of the most useful dream interpretation books on the market today.	2002-04-01

I love the format of presenting the Spanish on one page and the English equivalent on the facing page.  You can easily go from one to the other.  Because the stories are short and pretty basic, if you are trying to learn Spanish it is a great tutoring tool.  You should already know some basic Spanish before reading the book, but for the intermediate or advanced beginner it is a great way to increase your vocabulary and practice correct sentence structure.  In addition, the stories are from Spain and so teach some of the history and legends to help you get a feel for the country.  Finally, there is a small dictionary at the back of the book that contains most of the words that you might encounter in the text.<br />Whether you use it for a review, to learn Spanish, to increase your Spanish vocabulary or just like the stories, it is a great little book and this style of dual translation books is highly recommended as an adjunct to a Spanish course of any type to recommend to speed your learning of a foreign language.	2002-03-23

It is truly what the title suggests in that the publisher took three popular Dilbert books and placed them together into one large volume.  As always, the biting humor and often accurate portrayal of all things corporate will have you laughing out loud as you realize how absolutely preposterous some of the situations are while also realizing that this sure looks a lot like real life.	2002-03-23

The text covers just about every aspect of SQL from a setup and administrative point of view as well as the basics of database theory.  If you want a single general reference then this book works very well.  On the other hand, if you want a detailed reference on programming SQL then there are better texts.<br />The book covers the administration of an SQL Server in great detail including explaining why you would use a particular feature and why you may not want to use it in a different scenario.  For setting up a system and managing it this book it hard to beat.<br />Whether you are a new user, experienced user or an administrator, this book is hard to beat for theory, detailed information and administration of a Windows SQL Server 2000 system.  Highly recommended read and required on any administrator's bookshelf.	2002-03-23

Early Jewish tradition was to fill in interpretive information when necessary to resolve items that were ambiguous or unclear.  In addition, notes and commentary were often passed along with the texts and over time tended to become a part of the text.  As a result, the Bible of today includes a lot of commentary as well as the original texts.<br />Kugel's purpose is to try to reconstruct the Bible as it was in its original form as closely as possible.  While we all know that no copies of the original Bible exist today, the King James version was based on the Textus Receptus which was a Greek translation of the Bible and considered the oldest reliable source at the time.  Since then there have been many archaeological finds of manuscripts from earlier points in time and in the original Hebrew language.  Many of these passages differ somewhat from current translations.  In theory, the older versions should be closer to the original version.  Working from the oldest texts he examines some of the differences in the way passages were interpreted and what that could mean.  This gets us closer to an original version without all the intervening thoughts and interpretations that earlier writers had added in an attempt to make it more understandable and applicable to the people of their time.<br />Dr. Kugel thoroughly documents his work complete with quotes, sources and annotations as appropriate.<br />A fascinating book that sheds new light onto many passages it should be read by anyone attempting a serious and scholarly study of the Bible.	2002-03-23

It gives minimal information on formal Spanish but instead concentrates or getting the reader up to speed listening to, reading and speaking Spanish.  Think of it being like when you were a child and learned to speak English or whatever your native tongue.  You did not know all the rules for conjugating verbs or anything like that, but you did know what was the right word in a given situation.  That is more the focus of this book and it's method.  If you don't need to know technically precise Spanish but want to be able to get around on a trip to a Spanish speaking country or be able to understand basic signs and conversations then I would highly recommend it.	2002-03-23

The result is a book that teaches how to think critically and then apply those skills to everyday situations.  The world can be very confusing with the tremendous amount of information thrown at us every day.  How do you make a decision or analyze information to see if it is valuable to you or not?  This book details how to approach the various challenges of life by thinking clearly.  With an eight-step process to critical thinking, he provides information and exercises to get you going in the right direction.  Whether attacking problems, dealing with difficult people, deflecting propaganda directed at you or just bettering your life through better decision-making and fewer regrets, the collective knowledge in this text points the way to clear thinking.	2002-03-23

Where I would use one set of words to describe something someone else would use a totally different wording for the same thing.  Where I would use one type of illustration to make a point someone else will use a totally different one.  Friedman uses this sort of linguistic analysis along with other techniques to search the Old Testament and find passages that appear to be written by the same author.  What results is a Biblical history book that apparently had been scattered throughout several of the Old Testament books and now is brought together as one consistent and highly readable book.<br />Working from Hebrew sources, his research is sound and scholarly and yet the result is easily understandable and highly readable.  Mr. Friedman notes that as he researched this common authorship he noticed that each time one section ended the next section that met the same author's writing style started up from the same place the first left off as if there had been nothing between.  This further supported his position that it has at one time been one text and was probably the original work of prose for the Bible.<br />The book covers the period from the creation until the reign of Solomon and is a wonderful read for those interested in Biblical studies, early Jewish thought, or Biblical history.  A recommended read.	2002-03-23

Note that I said \\"marketing via e-mail\\" and not spamming via e-mail.  The authors actually address this issue and how to use e-mail marketing in a positive manner where it will be welcomed by the recipient and not instantly deleted.  Hans Peter Brondmo is an authority on this issue and is one of the owners of Post Communications, which uses e-mail marketing extensively.<br />The book details how to move from traditional marketing methods to an Internet based marketing system that concentrates on the efficient and positive use of e-mail.  It not only covers how to use it to obtain new customers but guides the reader step by step in how to effectively use e-mail to create and maintain customer loyalty and positive relationships.	2002-02-28

Not just how to get new customers, but how to maintain customer relations, how to create a decision support system, reporting on your data and multiple case studies.  What makes it unique among database marketing books is that it is not filled with technical words or jargon but gets down to the real world of how to use the principles in the book.  It starts with the basics of databases and moves into chapters on the economics of database marketing, designing the database, developing a strategy, customer loyalty, relationship marketing, customer cloning, financial planning and case studies.  A full and complete text on desktop database marketing it is a good read for anyone planning to market this way that leaves nothing to chance.	2002-02-28

An oversized book (as it should be in order to appreciate the full beauty of the photography), it is organized into five parts: The Land, Underwater, Science, The United States and The World.  Leave it out for guests to leaf through and enjoy because they will once they see it.  Of course it is not all just pictures, if you've ever wondered about those photographers behind the pictures it includes informative comments about them  and their achievements.<br /><br />I have noted that there are several reviews with negative comments about the size.  This is a coffee table style book at 12 inches by 10.5 inches.  Some have noted that their copy is 6 by 5 inches.  I reviewed the hardcover version which is large.  There may be another smaller version available or perhaps the paperback is smaller.  Make sure you are ordering what you want.	2002-02-28

The book not only goes over the most important aspects of running a business, but also provides best practices type information for each area.<br />Because each chapter is self-contained it does not depend on you reading prior chapters to understand the current one.  So, if you need to jump to the area on hiring and firing then you can do so and understand the chapter.  By the same token, if you don't need a chapter then you can just skip it (but I wouldn't advise you to do that because you never know when you may suddenly need it).  I liked the thoroughness and depth of coverage of the book.  In a world where too many books are nebulous and vague in their advice it is nice to find one that gives practical and useful advice.<br />Another high point of the book is the checklists.  The use of the checklist frees you from having to remember all the steps in a process or all the little problems that can emerge if something is missed.<br />The book is filled with practical advice and is sure to broaden your knowledge of management and provide you with more tools to manage your business.  From any level of management up to the top executives, this is a very useful book and a nice concise summary of the dozen or so separate books from my management courses in college.	2002-02-28

These four agreements are to be impeccable with your word, don't take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and always do your best.  Following these four agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz then teaches how Toltec laws can simplify our lives and how breaking old agreements that we were taught when we were young or have acquired over the years leads to personal freedom.	2002-02-28

As I read through the book I came to the realization that what he has discovered can only be described as holistic prayer.  It is prayer that involves every part of you; thought, emotions, belief, etc.  Why go another day with a prayer technique that we have learned from childhood with ritualistic repeating of things like, \\"Now I lay me down to sleep.....\\"?  Why not have a whole understanding of prayer and how it can be used to change the world.  That understanding is available now through this book.

Likewise, sometimes an inferior service ends up with many more customers.  Why is this the case?  Consumers want to feel connected to products in some way; they want a relationship with the product and/or the company that produces, markets or sells the product.  Beckwith does an excellent job of presenting his case in a concise manner and gives many, many detailed examples to illustrate his points.  The chapters are small and can easily be read in a fifteen or twenty minute break.  This combined with its small size makes it especially useful since it can easily be carried in a purse or briefcase where you can pull it out and read, re-read or refresh your memory on a regular basis.  Whether you are selling a product or a service, this book is required reading.  I spent several years as a top salesman with a close rate much higher than the average for my industry and product.  (A product that requires after sales service.)  This book includes many of the techniques that I used to build client relationships.  If you don't pick it up, read it, and use it then you had better be thinking strategically about how you are going to compete with the person who does because they will become a problem for you.	2002-02-20

What I found was a course that taught me more in two weeks than the two years that I took the course in high school.  This is a course in conversational German.  You don't learn the details of how to conjugate a verb into all the possible tenses and similar scholastic concerns.  What you learn is how to communicate with someone who speaks German.  Will you be totally fluent?  No.  But you will be able to get around and make yourself understood.  It gives you a better real world vocabulary than any of the other traveling courses or phrase courses that I have seen.  I wondered if it was easy for me since I already had some background in German and maybe it would not be so easy for a person who knew nothing about German.  So, I purchased and tried the Spanish course in which I had no knowledge whatsoever.  The result?  I actually learned conversational Spanish in two weeks and can carry on a basic conversation with ease.  Great system, great results, and by far the easiest way to learn a foreign language.	2002-02-13

Not quite as easy as one would be lead to believe from the cover, it is still one of the easiest methods I have ever had the pleasure of using.  And pleasure is the operative word, just listening to the CDs is all that is required.  No note taking, no study of vocabulary lists, nothing in the mode of traditional language learning.  Instead of going straight through the complete system I listened to each CD twice before going on to the next one.  The end result was that I could watch the Spanish channels and understand what is going on.  After finishing six of the eight CDs I was at a local tourist attraction with a friend who had just completed a thirteen week course at a local college.  A Latin woman approached us seeking help and he was totally useless while I was able to work through her conversation and provide her the answers that she needed.  How long did it take?  I just listened to it in my car instead of the stereo for two weeks.  Will you be totally conversant after completing the course?  No.  But you will have a good strong background in basic conversational Spanish and be able to carry on basic conversations with others.  The best way to learn conversational Spanish on the market today.	2002-02-13

Don't have time to search over hundreds of past issues to try to solve a problem?  This book is a compilation of helpful advice from the master of ingenious answers.  It is divided into appropriate sections such as cleaning, animal pests, cooking, household repairs and many others.  Each section can be a great read by itself but it is also useful as a reference since it has a thorough index to quickly locate the solution to any problem.  Whether it is getting rid of an odor, cleaning an unusual stain or fixing a creaking floorboard, there are simple solutions here for almost any problem.  Some will leave you wondering who tried it first and why (like rubbing table salt and a piece aluminum flatware in your hand to remove onion and garlic odors from your hands), but the end result is the same, it works.  Get the book and keep it someplace where you can grab it in a hurry, you never know when you will need it.	2002-02-12

Especially with it's growing popularity with various New Age movements.  Silberman takes a different direction and concentrates on the historical and political factors that influenced the development of the Kabbalah and it's rituals.  He takes the reader back to the beginnings or many of the rituals and discussed the political and historical influences of that time and how they worked together to weave a rich tapestry of religious tradition.<br />He has a remarkable ability to take a complex subject and put it into a readable style as he takes the reader on a journey from the Babylonian empire through the Roman and Byzantine empires, through Europe and to Israel.  For the new age reader who is more interested in the rituals and methods of the Kabbalah this will probably not be their favorite book, but for those desiring an understanding of the roots of the religious tradition this is an excellent book with a perspective that others do not offer.  A recommended read for any student of history, religion, or political sciences or others who just want to understand such things.	2002-02-12

It immediately draws up images of religious indoctrination into one or another particular religious group.  If that is what you are looking for in this book then you will be very disappointed.  Instead it is a recounting of the spiritual growth of the authors as well as their collection of inspirational writings from around the world.  The inspirational passages represent the wisdom and deep understanding of many cultures and are hard to read without some sort of emotional stirrings.  Well selected to be appropriate to the section, it is not indoctrination designed to lead you to confirmation in a particular religion but inspiration designed to lead you into your own personal confirmation.  A great book for keeping a healthy and positive perspective in life.	2002-02-12

He had won an emmy seven times for his broadcast reporting and was considered a peer among the likes of Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings (at least considered a peer by viewers if not by Dan, Tom or Peter).  In his book he steps forward to tell how reporting bias has interfered with truthful and honest reporting using specific examples.  You'll note that I said he was a respected veteran reporter.  After coming forward with an expose of the liberal bias in news reporting and how it is used to support the causes of various pressure groups instead of actually reporting news in an evenhanded manner, he was terminated from his employment.  The only thing that I did not like about the book was the common thread that ran through all of it that sounded like a child ranting and raving about the local bully.... Dan said this, Peter said that, while it may be accurate, hearing the story once was enough without having it repeated again and again throughout the book.  Mr. Goldberg's writing should rise above this like all the rest of the book.  When it turned to actual examples of how the facts differed from the reporting in multiple situations it becomes a fascinating book.  The examples are accurate and very detailed.  You end up with the conviction that this is a timely book, from a respected source, providing compelling evidence of strong bias in news reporting today.  I had the advantage of confirming Mr. Goldberg's accusations and depictions of the character of various high profile newscasters with a retired news producer from one of the big three networks.

This book is the standard issue book at many cooking schools.  That is actually how I came upon my first copy, from a friend who had finished Chef school and purchased a newer edition.<br />The illustrations are beautiful and very helpful, the directions clear and concise.  Make no mistake, this is a complete cooking school course with everything except the tuition and practice.  Starting at the beginning is a good idea because it is laid out like a course.  So, it teaches a technique and then from that point forward in the book it refers to the technique.  However, with a thorough index it is not a problem to find out where the technique was discussed.<br />There is no better book to learn professional cooking or just learn the techniques to astound your friends.  Thorough and well documented, when it comes to learning professional cooking techniques, this is the book to have.	2002-01-30

How about that new client sales meeting?  How about that blind date?  Or the daughter's new boyfriend?  A teacher?  An opponent?  It really doesn't matter why you need to quickly determine how to communicate with a person and understand the way they think, the fact is that we all need to do it on a regular basis in one form or another.  This book works through the Personality Typing paradigm of psychology and emerges with a comprehensive set of tools to determine quickly where a person fits within that paradigm.  This information can then be used to communicate effectively with the other person.<br />It works through this process by starting with you, the reader.  You go through several steps to determine which personality type you match and helping you to understand how that personality type tends to communicate.  Then you learn how to communicate with others with each of the different personality types.  It is a highly recommended book with techniques that are useful for anyone in any social or business situation, but expect to spend some time learning all the personality types.	2002-01-30

So, while sending your partner a nice card to cheer them up might mean love to you, you can't understand why it just elicits a brief \\"Thanks\\".  On the other hand, he calls during the day and says he'll be home early this evening and just gets an \\"Okay, take the hamburger out of the fridge when you get home then\\" response from you.  Since you express love by sending the card and he did by coming home early to see you, you both feel that the other does not express affection for you.  If he understood and sent you a card once in a while he would be speaking your language and you would understand that he is trying to tell you that he loves you.  That is what this book is about, understanding how each of you expresses your love for the other and learning to express affection in the other person's language.  Filled with examples and sections that help you and your partner learn about each other's preferred method of communicating affection, it is a highly recommended read for everyone who is in any kind of relationship.	2002-01-30

If you have every physical thing that you need but still feel something is missing, then this book is for you.  If you think you could be happier if you only had more, then this book is for you.  If you think that you have problems that others don't seem to have or that others have created for you, then this book is for you.<br />He takes an old proverbial saying that happiness is not in \\"getting what you want but wanting what you get\\" and he works outward from there.  Dealing with many spiritual aspects and techniques to learn to be happy with your life, it is filled with ideas and helpful information.<br />The emphasis is primarily on prayer and meditation to learn to accept and be happy with your current situation.  A good book and a recommended read, but know up front that it is not a guide to getting things, but a spiritual guide to becoming happy with what you have.  Not for everyone but I am sure that there are those to which it will be a Godsend.	2002-01-30

I say introductory because it starts at the very basic level and explains items step by step.  On the other hand it is pretty much an intermediate text because of its thoroughness and attention to detail.  And yet it is written in a style that is light, easy to read, and easy to understand.  One of the problems with trying to learn handwriting analysis is that there are a lot of books that contradict one another in terms of what a particular stroke means.  This book's author is a well respected authority in the field and the book contains information that is widely accepted by most schools of handwriting analysis.  Lots of good information with no blind alleys and many notes and examples, it is probably the top beginner/intermediate book on the subject out there today.	2002-01-30

The first book, Addictive Thinking, was pretty much a rehash to anyone who has read anything about alcoholism and addiction.  If you are completely new to trying to understand alcoholic addiction then it may have some value, but there are better books on that subject.  It would have more accurately been named Addictive Thinking in the Alcoholic.  On the other hand the second book, The Addictive Personality, was an excellent and broad reaching tome on addiction.  It covers how addictions form, what they mean to the person, what the person is thinking, their fears, concerns and innermost turmoil.  It not only applied to alcoholic addiction but food addictions, power addictions, sexual addictions, etc.  If you truly want to understand how addictions form and what is really going on below the surface then this is one of the best books I have read on the subject.	2002-01-26

You may have to tell a friend something that you know will hurt them deeply, you may have to tell the boss that you are quitting after many years of a friendly working environment, you may have to break off a relationship or who knows what else.  Difficult conversations are a part of life and often a staple part of life with a teenager.  That is where this book comes in.  The authors discuss the structure of these conversations and how you can get to the heart of the matter with compassion and clarity so that each party gets through it as a team or with a minimum of emotional pain.  It also examines why they are difficult conversations.  In short it teaches how to examine situations in terms of how each person perceived what happened, how each person feels about the situation or is likely to feel when they are confronted, and the identity issues that are involved when discussing the subject.  A fine book that will help many people learn how to deal with a difficult conversation, but should be augmented by \\"Words that Hurt; Words the Heal\\" or a similar text.	2002-01-24

Written in an easy to read style, each section starts with a handful of questions to point out how much you already know about graphology without realizing it.  It then goes on to explain how the samples should be interpreted and supplies the detailed knowledge needed to analyze it further.  There is a chapter with some analysis of doodles, but it is far too small to be of much value.  As for the rest of the book, all the typical forms of analysis from margins and slants to the details of crossing a \\"t\\" or doting an \\"i\\" are well covered.  Whether a beginner to the field or an experienced graphologist, this book has everything you need to understand graphology or improve your skill level.

It is a workbook containing most of the common and not so common techniques being used for relaxation and stress reduction today.  Each chapter not only describes a technique but also what symptoms you can expect it to relieve and an estimate of how long you will have to use it in order to master the technique.  I have seen no other book that does such a thorough job as this one.  That is not to say that there are not others that are much better on a specific technique, but this is the best overall survey of all the currently used and effective techniques and the only one that guides you to what to expect, the details of the techniques and how long you will have to practice before seeing results.	2002-01-24

The author is the director of an NLP training center in New York City, but the writing style and presentation of the material is done in an easy to understand and conversational style.  The book is also packed with examples to demonstrate the concepts, which helps tremendously in understanding how they are supposed to work.  At the end of each section are practical exercises that help you apply the techniques covered in that chapter.<br />I really liked the way that the book is laid out in short chapters that could be read in just a few minutes.  It made it easy to pick it up when I had a few minutes, read a chapter, read the exercises and apply that technique.  I also enjoyed the chapter about changing behavior and working with problems that you have tried unsuccessfully to rid yourself of before.  Some of the first sections seemed to spend a lot of time on basic communication techniques, which is a very important part of NLP, but it seemed repetitive to the point of being almost boring.  If you find the first sections fascinating then that is great, if you find them common sense and a bit more boring then hang in there as it does get better and provide a lot of useful information before the book is completed.  A good book with a lot of basic useful techniques that you can apply yourself, it is a wonderful reference that should be read several times a year to remind you that there are other techniques that you may not have tried which might help you unlock the promise of who you can be.	2002-01-24

This is the best book that I have read on the subject of Windows 2000 Active Directory Design and Deployment.  So many other books read like Microsoft white papers and nothing more.  This one includes a lot of real world advice and examples for designing and implementing Active Directory.  In addition it does one thing that other technical books don't generally do... it offers a business reasons in addition to the technical reasons why you would want to implement Active Directory in a particular way.  In a world where technical people generally do not understand what a business is trying to accomplish and business people don't understand what the technical people are doing or can do, this is a refreshing breath of fresh air.<br />The subject is covered thoroughly and the advice is solid and based on real world experiences.  No stone is left unturned in providing a concise and detailed path for analyzing the system, looking at business needs and problems, networking traffic issues and every tip and pitfall that you might encounter.  An excellent reference book to solve problems as well as a fine cookbook that walks you through the design and deployment process one step at a time.	2002-01-16

This book on the Windows 2000 Registry covers areas such as optimization, fixing problems and disaster recovery in addition to the traditional information on Keys, Entries and Data Types.  You will find that Hipson tends to take the \\"official\\" Microsoft position on many items.  However, there are many third party alternatives out there to help resolve problems.  For example, as consultants our company often has to work on a system that we did not set up.  So, since security is often messed up, the registry has problems, etc. we find ourselves in the position of having to boot the system in DOS and access the NTFS drive to repair a problem (and, No, I am not going to explain here how to reset the Administrator password this way).  Hipson indicates that it can't be done (the official Microsoft position).  However, there are many third party utilities out there in the real world that make this a no-brainer to do.<br />While this book contains a great deal of very good and very detailed information on the registry, the text actually is written in a very choppy manner.  It is an exceptional text to have around to help resolve a problem but not a particularly easy one to read from beginning to end.  In short, a better reference than a read, but an exceptional reference at that.	2002-01-16

Quality advice, technically accurate and containing many tips and warnings of potential traps, it simply is a required text for anyone working with this operating system.  Since my experience has taught me that Mark Minasi's books were quite simply the best on the market and this edition was as timely, thorough, accurate and detailed as any of his other works, I checked out the first edition and soon found out why it had received many poor reviews.  There is no better reference for the advanced user nor no better book for the beginner to learn the system accurately and in detail than this book.

My first experience with one of his books was after actually trying to do roaming user profiles in Microsoft Windows NT and finding that out of five books I consulted only Mark Minasi's was accurate and complete.  The others were written from Microsoft White Papers which had an error and the authors had obviously not actually set up the profiles because it was impossible given their instructions.  Since then I always look for Mark Minasi's books first and have always found the most through and useful information in them.  This book is no exception.<br />In Mastering Windows 2000 Server he covers all the topics that you need to understand and setup a system.  Topics covered include DNS, Active Directory, security (internal, remote, file level, etc.), heterogenous networks, the MMC, TCP/IP, IIS, RAS, Software Installation and dozens of other areas.  His treatment of each area is thorough and written in a style that most readers with a basic understanding of computers can easily understand.  It is not a book that is specifically pointed toward passing one of the MCSE exams but is much more useful than those books that teach you how to spit out Microsoft answers.  Instead it actually gives you the foundation and knowledge to actually work with the system and resolve real world problems, something that most exam focused books do not generally provide.<br />This book should be on the bookshelf of any administrator who is working in a Windows 2000 Server environment or anyone who wants to understand the system.  While my company has several technical books on the 2000 Operating System, Mark Minasi's are always the most consulted.  The other books are in such good condition that they could be sold again as new.... but not Mastering Windows 2000 Server by Mark Minasi.

However, it covers Active Directory in more general theoretical terms and does not do a thorough job of detailing how to plan and implement the system.  If you are unfamiliar with NDS or other Directory Services, the LDAP protocols and similar then this book is a good place to start.  If you are already familiar with such things then you will find this book to be lacking in useful information.  My recommendation would be to purchase the book if you are new to the whole Directory concept and read it as a foundational text and then graduate to a more detailed text, such as Windows Active Directory Design and Deployment, before actually implementing Active Directory or attempting to resolve problems with it.  For someone who already understands the concepts they should just go ahead and move to the above mentioned book and skip this one.	2002-01-16

This is about growing a consulting practice and not about starting one.  It assumes that you already have an established practice that you now want to expand.  There is almost nothing in here related to the initial marketing and starting a new business.<br />The book also concentrates on the needs of small firms in terms of the number of employees and owners.  This is not the book for a large consulting company although many of the principles can be applied to such companies.<br />Okay, now that that is out of the way, if you are wanting to grow a consulting business then this is a great book.  It carefully goes through the most common mistakes that consultants make and how those mistakes keep their business from growing.  The suggestions are strong, time tested and very valuable.  I completed a Master's Degree in business and the items in this book were more valuable then the entire five years of college.<br />Does it work?  My company grew until it became a target for merger with a competitor.  Then we started a new division and are using the same techniques for it to grow and it is growing faster than anyone expected.<br />When it comes to proposals I prefer the much more in depth book by Tom Sant on Proposal Writing but this one still does a good job in that area.  This is a great book for the already established consultant who just can't seem to get to that next step.	2001-12-15

It does have a lot of historical information and makes a fascinating read just for that fact.  But in addition it has scientific information from many disciples that just builds more fascination into the subject.<br />Each chapter stands alone and so you can pick one that sounds interesting and read it.  Each deals with a different aspect of the season and so does not build on a previous chapter.  Read it in the order of your interests.  Chapters cover such areas as Santa, reindeer, Christmas trees, food, snow and seasonal moods.<br />The writing style is easy flowing and fun to read.  You don't need to know anything about physics, or any other science for that matter, to follow and understand the book.  It is a unique style of writing because the book is easy and fun to read like a novel and yet packed so full of information that it is more like a science book.  So, which is it?  I'm not sure, but if regular science books were this interesting and fun instead of full of dry examples then perhaps science scores in schools would climb.	2001-12-15

This seemed like a simple problem on the surface.  On a game show you are given the choice of three doors behind one of which is a fabulous prize.  You pick one and afterwards the host turns around one of the wrong door.  Then he offers you to keep the door you originally chose or to change doors.  Do you stay or change?  This simple problem caused a great deal of controversy and numerous letters after Marilyn Vos Savant stated that it would be better to switch.  Her explanation is here as well and letters from various scholars as to why she was wrong.  Turns out, she was right.<br />With that background to catch your interest (and it does so very well) she then moves on to other topics and how statistics can be used to support just about any position.  Of particular fascination are the ways in which our intuition leads us to one conclusion but logic and mathematics prove that conclusion to be wrong.  As a good example, she covers politics and how the political engine uses our intuitional errors and statistics to prove both sides right!<br />I will have to say that she does a good job of explaining the problems and conclusions in a style that even someone who does not understand mathematics very well can still comprehend.  There are several other books that cover similar topics and if you like this one then you might also try them.  I loved Innumeracy and found it fascinating to read through.	2001-12-15

The overriding theme is to do things now and don't put them off.  The book covers all the bases for organization from developing a routine, planning processes, following through, managing and maintaining.  The area that it does not cover is the psychological factors in getting things done.  For example, one of the books that I read noted that one of the problems with a \\"to-do\\" type list is that we tend to look at it and do the easiest or most fun things first.  So, as a result our reward for completing one of the items on our \\"to-do\\" list is that we get a less desireable and more difficult task to do next.  Rearranging the \\"to-do\\" list so that you do the most difficult and least fun things first you set yourself up for success because as a reward for doing the difficult item you get a less difficult item or more fun item to do.  I know it is just playing games, but it does affect how well people get their \\"to-do\\" list completed.  I wish that he had included research like that in the book in addition to all of the good ideas for organizing and keeping track of things.<br />This book is designed solely for the work environment and getting things organized and done at work.  Still many of the items can be applied at home too.  It is a good book and a good read with a program that works if you implement and practice it.	2001-12-15

It takes the basics of finance and accounting and describes them in a very non-technical and easy to understand manner.  I am a degreed accountant with a strong finance and economics background and find it difficult to explain things to business owners and managers in a way that makes sense to them.  This book resolves that problem.  By the time they read through it once we can at least talk together and I don't feel like I am using a foreign language.<br />A very valuable book that should be required reading for anyone who goes into business for theirself or moves up the corporate ladder to a position where understanding these things is beneficial for their career.  While it is not a treatise on the details of accounting and finance it will give you a broad enough scope to understand what you should be doing and why things work the way that they do.  A recommended read.	2001-12-15

While she gives good advice about the need for insurance, savings, and similar items that you would expect from a financial planner, she also looks at how your past affects your current situation.  Your early experiences and the concepts of significant others affects your belief system and can free you to enjoy financial freedom or bind you into a position where you can't do what needs to be done.  For an extreme example, I knew a person who had lived through the depression and lived in an older mobile home until he died.  When he died they tore down the mobile home and found that he had over a million dollars in cash and bonds hidden in the trailer.  He past experience with the depression had made him a slave to hoarding money.<br />The nine steps include understanding how your past affects your present, facing your past and creating new truths, being honest with yourself, being responsible to those who depend on you, understanding the flow of money and recognizing true wealth.<br />Many people will find this a book that frees them from financial slavery so that they can go forward and have a more fruitful life.	2001-12-15

Although I photograph free lance for Today's Photographer Magazine and American Image Press, I consider myself an advanced amateur.  I wish that I had had this book in my hands when I started photographing.  It would have saved me countless dollars of development expense and time on photographs that were not at all what I wanted.<br />The book covers all the basics of photography: exposure, shutter speeds, apertures, light metering,  composition, depth of field, etc.  It covers the subjects in a very easy to understand writing style.  And when it comes to pictures, the book is literally filled with pictures, excellent pictures, showing the effect of various changes to camera settings.  After reading the book (or any chapter in the book) you will better understand what you need to do to take those beautiful and moving pictures that elude the basic &quot;snapshot&quot; photographer.<br />For a new photographer this is the place to start.  After you understand the concepts in this book and have a good handle on them then it would make sense to move up to a good book on the zone system or learn developing or something similar.  I've not encountered any other basic book that is as filled with good information and so many, many excellent pictures as examples of the concepts.	2001-12-15

It is mostly about airplanes and there is airplane after airplane on page after page.  No matter what you want your airplane to do, glide for long distance, do tricks or just plain look cool, it is in this book.  Unlike some other books on this subject it does not have any premarked papers secured to the inside of the book that you can rip out and fold.  On the other hand, these planes use ordinary paper and have such good illustrations that you can make them without any premarked patterns on the paper.  I love the book.  I've folded most of the planes and flew them.  It makes me a popular person at children get togethers and allows me to be a child again once in a while myself.<br />The only thing that I don't like is that it has no theory of paper airplanes.  If you fold one and it does not seem to be acting right then there is nothing in here that might teach you how to correct the problem.  If you want to learn the aerodynamics involved in making a paper airplane act the way it does, how lift and drag affect the flight, etc, then this book is useless to you.  But if you just want to follow the diagrams and make some great airplanes that are consistently fun, then this is your book.<br />Just \\"plane\\" fun.	2001-12-15

It does a good job of explaining the process of hypnosis and self-hypnosis but I would not say that it contains any particular \\"secrets\\".  The book follows standard procedures and provides a great number of illustrative inductions and similar scripted information.  It also goes out on a limb in some areas such as hypnotizing someone over the phone and similar.  Standard hypnotists would have some problems with this and similar parts of the book, so take part of it with a grain of salt.<br />It is a good book but if you want to understand hypnosis, hypnotic theory and application then the book Hypnosis, Medicine of the Mind is better.  On the other hand, if you are having trouble figuring out how to phrase an induction or how to create the wording that produces the results that you want then this book is a good one to reference for example scripts.  Here is where I think it's greatest value lies - lots and lots of example scripts to help you understand how to phrase things because how you say it greatly determines the results that you get.	2001-12-15

The focus of most proverb books is a short piece of knowledge that can be used to illustrate a point or add something deep and meaningful to a speech.<br />This book varies greatly from that format in that it supplies proverbs from many, many countries.  What I find particularly interesting is that it gives you a chance to understand differences in culture by understanding their proverbs.  For example, a common proverb in European countries is something along the line of \\"The squeaky wheel gets the grease\\".  On the other hand, the related Japanese proverb is \\"The nail that stands up gets beaten down\\".  Both refer to the same type of incident but show the cultural differences between the two.  Not just a book of proverbs, but a book of cultural understanding.<br />Fascinating read, great coffee table book, well organized, a must have for anyone who enjoys reading proverbs or just wants a good book around that is filled with valuable thoughts garnered over the years from a wide variety of cultures.	2001-12-15

Daily negotiations include with employees, supervisors, children, co-workers, or just about anyone that you run across.  The book goes over the steps of negotiating including identifying your weaknesses and your opponent's weaknesses, breaking a deadlock, handling difficult people, when to mediate, etc.  The book gives specific strategies for specific situations.  How you would negotiate a better price for a purchase is different for how you would negotiate a pay raise and these differences are discussed and illustrated.  The author also discusses common traps that negotiators set up for the unwary as well as blunders to be avoided.  I was pleasantly surprised to go to an appliance store where the prices are clearly marked on the appliances and find that I was able to negotiate a better price with the salesman.  I guess that even when it states a firm price, things are still negotiable if you know how to approach it.	2001-12-15

The book is a combination of his previous four books.  They are placed one after the other and bound together as one book.  The problem is that the books have not been culled of repeats.  So, many quotes show up in all four books and therefore show up four times in this book.<br />I will have to say that it contains lots of quotes that I have not seen anywhere else and it is an enjoyable read.  Each of the four books is organized into logical sections and related quotes in each section.<br />When you have ten minutes of time to kill it is easy to pick up and read a few passages and then put it down.  It is an interesting read and is well worth the price even with the repeats.	2001-12-15

In his book, Inner Cleansing, you will learn about the why and how of cleaning out the &quot;sludge&quot; that accumulates in our bodies.  How does it get there?  We live in a toxic world.  Between air pollution, additives to our water supply, additives to our foods, dyes, colorings, preparation methods, stress, etc. the modern person has no choice but to ingest, breathe or come into contact with various toxins and other problematic items.  These in turn cause premature aging, aches and pains, fatigue, heart problems, high blood pressure and a variety of other symptoms.<br />The book offers techniques to cleanse yourself of these toxins.  The techniques are simple and the things you need are readily available.  Unlike other programs for detoxification, this one does not require months to complete.  After only a couple of days you should feel the difference.  If you are having a nagging problem or just not feeling like yourself these days, this book may have the answers for you.  If it doesn't work for you then you have lost nothing, if it does work then you have regained a better life.  I will say that I often feel better after a regular cleansing program and am much more active than most of my friends my age.	2001-12-15

Another great book from the author that I have come to consider one of the most enlightened professionals in the field of human behavior.  Dr. David J. Lieberman, Ph.D. has written several books that have been translated into several languages and are consistently best sellers because he truly understands the psychological principles that affect us.  Yet he has an easy writing style that is easy to follow and easy to understand.<br />This is a stellar book for those wishing to understand deception and how to uncover the truth.  Like all books of this type it provides a wealth of information but you have to apply this information.  I decided to try practicing by using some of the techniques on the television game show \\"To tell the truth\\".  While this is not the best situation because the camera often leaves the contestants and it would be better to be able to view them all at all times, it is still a good place to practice.  Did it work?  Well, at the beginning I was getting the right person about one third of the time.  A week later I was finding out who was lying ninety percent of the time!  Now that is an excellent improvement!<br />Okay, detecting when you are being lied to is one thing.  Finding out the truth can be another.  Dr. Lieberman has received some criticism for this section of the book.  It seems that many people have problems with some of the techniques.  That is not to say that they are ineffective, they work well.  Some people have problems with such things as \\"leading questions\\" or feel that you are being deceptive when you ask an open-ended question.  What parent has not enjoyed the surprises that come forth after telling their child \\"I know what you did and it will go easier on you if you just confess now\\".  Of course the child is wondering what thing that the parent knows about because they want to confess to the thing they know about and get a lesser punishment.  But they don't want to confess to things the parent doesn't know about.<br />To have a problem with doing the same thing puts one in the position of having to defend the idea that something that is wrong to do with adults is okay with children because they are somehow less deserving of respect.  Or, perhaps, an adult who is lying to you is more deserving of respect than a child who is being honest with you.  Not a position that I would want to be in.<br />Well, if you still have a problem with some of the techniques of getting to the truth then you can just try confronting them with the lies that you have uncovered.  Remember that I successfully moved my ability to detect lies from one third to ninety percent just by using the information and not interacting with the person on the television at all.  All I had to do was watch them and listen to what they said.<br />I thought that it was great that he also included a chapter on being our own worst enemy... when we lie to ourselves.<br />In summary, it is a highly recommended book and very useful.  It details why you should suspect lying in various circumstances and how to confirm those suspicions.  Is it effective?  Yes.  However, if you are dealing with a problem of a friend, co-worker or someone else that you have to deal with on a regular basis lying to you then I would recommend a couple of additional books to help you confront them diplomatically and maintain the relationship.  One would be \\"Words that Hurt, Words that Heal\\" and the other would be \\"Get Anyone to Do Anything\\".have a problem with doing the same thing puts one in the position of having to defend the idea that something that is wrong to do with adults is okay with children because they are somehow less deserving of respect.

He discusses the obvious damages of slander, propaganda and gossip and also other ways that we hurt others.  For example, if we know something to be true about someone then do we tell someone else?  Well, that depends on the circumstances.  Is there an issue of someone else's safety involved?  Will it help another to avoid financial or other mistakes?  If it is just something that you know but will do nothing but cause humiliation to the other person then it is best to keep it to yourself, even if it is the truth.  If the only reason to tell someone else is to lower their opinion of the person then it is unethical to disclose the information.<br />Can people change?  I'm sure that each of us knows at least one person who has made a complete change in their lifestyle.  Some for the better and some for the worst.

Lieberman, Ph.D. is a recognized expert in the field of human behavior.  With multiple books translated in multiple languages this is yet another fine example of his ability to give sound advice in a down to earth and useful manner.  He divides the book into the five following general sections.<br />Section 1 relates to building rapport both instant rapport and keeping it over long periods.  It covers everything from first impressions, to getting someone to like you, to appearing confident, and many other items.<br />Section 2 relates to detecting if someone is lying or manipulating you.<br />Section 3 relates to taking control of a situation and getting people to actually do something.  Getting someone to actually take your advice, follow through on a commitment, do a favor, get along together, etc. are all covered in this section.<br />Section 4 relates to winning at a competition.  Possible competitions include not only a game but job interviews, dating and similar.<br />Section 5 relates to dealing with life's normal annoying, difficult situations.  For example, people who won't return phone calls, forgiveness, breaking bad news, dealing with rumors, dealing with a complaint, dealing with jealousy, etc.<br />It is easy to read the title to the book and assume that inside are the secrets to manipulating others and allowing you to take advantage of them.  This is not the case at all as Dr. Lieberman starts on page one with the comment that these techniques are not \\"ways to manipulate other people into liking you\\".  Are you going to get someone who can't stand your personality to suddenly like you and stand in line for the opportunity to do you a favor?  Not likely.  However, in the hectic world of today just getting someone to slow down enough to even notice you can be quite a chore.  This sort of situation is where these techniques are valuable.<br />Also if you feel manipulated by someone and don't know how to avoid it or get out of the trap then the information can be very valuable.  Recognizing when you are not in control of your own desires is the first step to changing the situation.  This book can help you to understand what is happening and why you feel the way you do and then it goes one step further in showing you how you can change the situation.<br />The bottom line is that everyone should know these techniques not only so that they can recognize when they are being manipulated and can do something about it, but also so they can tell when strong feelings are not what they seem but are the result of some basic principle such as the law of association or reciprocal affection or something similar.  How to make a good impression, how to change a bad one, how to stop being manipulated, how to regain control of your life, how to handle the problems of life, how to examine your feelings about someone and know if you really feel positive (or negative) about them or if it is just the normal reaction to various stimuli, it is all pretty much here in this book.  If there were a great book that gave an overview of these principles this one is it.  There are other great books that deal with one or two of these topics in greater detail, but none that I have read that expose you to the whole gamut of psychological principles with persuading, motivating, or getting others to at least accept your opinion as valid.

How to make a good impression, how to change a bad one, how to stop being manipulated, how to regain control of your life, how to handle the problems of life, how to examine your feelings about someone and know if you really feel positive (or negative) about them or if it is just the normal reaction to various stimuli, it is all pretty much here in this book.  If there were a great book that gave an overview of these principles this one is it.  There are other great books that deal with one or two of these topics in greater detail, but none that I have read that expose you to the whole gamut of psychological principles with persuading, motivating, or getting others to at least accept your opinion as valid.  A must on the bookshelf of anyone but the most recalcitrant hermit.	2001-11-10
1776944:US	43546353	R1ASSXJPBA7D7B	1579120865	425764221	5087 Trivia Questions & Answers	Books	4	44	45	N	N	Large book packed with trivia questions and answers	5087 Trivia Questions and Answers is one of the most thorough collections that I have read.  Of course one of the problems with trivia is that what one person finds fascinating another could care less about.  So, while one person would be fascinated by the 74 pages of questions on Sports and Games, I could care less.  Then again, the questions on the World and American history are great. With that in mind, knowing how much emphasis is placed on which categories should help determine if this book would be of interest to you.  It is divided into fifteen chapters, each with it's own focus of questions.  The chapters cover Arts, Comics &amp; Literature, 64 pgs, Sports &amp; Games, 74 pgs, War &amp; the Military, 26 pgs, Television &amp; Radio, 54 pgs, Business, Advertising &amp; Inventions, 38 pgs, Religion, the Bible &amp; Mythology, 14 pgs, America - Past &amp; Present, 78 pgs, The World, 66 pgs, Language, 32 pgs, Food, 24 pgs, Music &amp; Theater, 54 pgs, Presidential Trivia, 30 pgs, Science, Nature &amp; Medicine, 50 pgs, The Cinema, 116 pgs, and Miscellaneous, 24 pgs.<br />One thing that was different about this trivia book when compared to others that I have read is that you can't really cheat with it.  With most trivia books I have to admit that I end up doing something like the Jeopardy television show.  It is so easy to look ahead when reading a question and kind of steal a glance at the answer.  When the answer is right there, right after the question it is just so tempting to sneak a peak.  After a while you can end up reading the answers and then the question.  In this book the questions are on one page and the answers are on the back of the same page.  No sneaking a peak.  In addition, you can have two or three of you reading the book and discussing what you think the answers might be without someone looking ahead at the answers.  I really liked the format, I really liked the trivia choices, I really liked most of the categories.  Among trivia books, I really liked the book.liked the book.	2001-11-10

David Feldman has yet another winner with this book.  Personally I have loved his Imponderables books and this is the largest collection to date.  What are Imponderables?  Well, to be brief, they are the questions that everyone seems to ask at one time or another, but would not have the first idea where to find the answer.  For example, why do weather thermometers use red mercury and medical thermometers use red mercury?  Why are peanuts listed under the ingredients of plain M&amp;Ms?  Can one spider get stuck in the web of another one?  While the questions are trivial this is not like traditional trivia.  Among other things, my trivia books are always where I left them.  People pick it up read a few and put it down.  Then later they may pick it up again and read a few more.  With this book I have a hard time keeping track of where the book is located.  People pick it up read a few, can't put it down and take it with them to another room.  By the couch, by the chair, in a bedroom, in the kitchen, in the bathroom, who knows where it ends up?  Part of the fun is also being a child again.  The questions are the same kind of things that children ask when they are innocent and not afraid to ask questions about anything.  Get in touch with the child inside you and ask the questions that you wouldn't ask anymore as an adult.... Do Penguins have knees?	2001-11-10

The book is clear about that position though as it states right in the beginning that it is for \\"IT Professionals working with 2000 Server or who plan to take the exam\\".  It also states that it \\"Assumes a fundamental networking windows interface knowledge and BIOS settings and changing them\\".<br />Each chapter is followed by a lab exercise that helps the reader to apply the lessons learned in that chapter.  The problem is that in order to install the Windows 2000 Server software and be able to do the lab exercise you need two computers that meet the minimum requirements for Windows 2000 Server.  For most people they probable don't have two of them just sitting around.<br />A lot of people have complained that the book covered a lot of topics that were not on the exam.  While this may have been the case, I think that it is a good thing.  If you want something to make yourself another Microsoft clone who can pass an exam but not know anything about how to really do anything in the real world then get a book that focuses just on passing the exam and not one that has any additional information.<br />If all you want to do is pass the exam then look at something else like Transcender that does not require a Windows 2000 Server to learn on.  This book is suited to study for the exam, but does have a lot of other additional information that a real administrator (as compared to a Microsoft Certified certificate holder) might need.<br />On the other hand, much of the information assumes a fairly strong knowledge of many networking topics.  Many items are given in a cookbook fashion with a `how to do it' focus and little or no explanation as to why you would do it that way.<br />For most people this book is firmly in the middle ground; too much additional information for just test preparation, not enough detail for understanding true administration.  Too much of one, not enough of the other.  If this is where you are at in your knowledge level then it would be a good book.  If you can afford only one book then it would be a good book.  On the other hand there are better test preparation books and better administration book, but the cost is much higher for two books than one that is somewhere in the middle.h of one, not enough of the other.

Using a common sense approach they discuss why the traditional methods of dealing with bad eyesight are just another example of our society and everyone wanting a quick fix to any problem.  Instead of dealing with the problem we tend to grab the quick and easy fix and don the glasses and have the laser surgery or whatever gives us better eyesight instantly even if it is not in our long term best interest.<br />The book then proceeds to various exercises and techniques designed to correct the various causes of eye problems.  I tried the exercises for a while and found that it did seem to help me.  My eyes were not all that bad at a -2 and -1.5.  Now I have begun to notice that my eyes ache and sometimes I get a headache when I wear my glasses for an extended period of time.  Quite a change from wearing them all the time a couple of months ago.	2001-11-02

He covers quantum mechanics to some extend and the problem of an infinite number of parallel worlds which are created and collapsed on a near constant basis.  There are many examples of how when dealing with infinities most of our logic deserts us and the very basis on which we understand things may not hold true.  For example if you have two sets of numbers and one set has all integers and the other has the squares of all numbers possible then which set is larger?  The set with the squares of all numbers is missing an infinite number of numbers (for example, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, etc)  and so the one with all possible integers is larger since it contains all numbers.  But since all numbers have a square then they are the same size.  How can the be they same size and one infinitely larger than the other at the same time?  When dealing with infinities those rules don't apply and there is no contradiction.<br />Mr. Rucker leads us on a wonderful trail of discovering how these things work on a philosophical level and how they all relate together.  What sort of infinities exist and how does understanding infinities affect our concepts of philosophy are questions that this book attempts to work through.  A thoroughly enjoyable read for those who would like to expand their way of thinking or who enjoy delving into concepts that defy logic while being totally logical.	2001-11-02

Of course, whether it is interesting to you or not depends on what you are looking for.  If you want first hand accounts of what the Explorers saw and what their thoughts were then it can be interesting.  On the other hand, you have to understand that when they wrote their thoughts the purpose was to record what they saw and not to create a story for an average reader.  They were not concerned with reading style or any other similar information.  It reminds me of the translations of the Journals of Columbus.  Interesting at times, but pretty boring at other times.  Of course, those probably were pretty boring days spending day after day on the ship.<br />Things that I did like were some of the descriptions of natural wonders, animals, plants, etc.  It includes a liberal sprinkling of period maps and illustrations that make it interesting to see the difficulties that they were facing with so much information yet to be discovered.  I also liked the great number of quotes from original texts complete with misspellings and syntax problems.<br />I did not find it particularly interesting and had difficulty working my way through it.  There are other books that cover this subject in a better writing style.	2001-11-02

Not only one parallel universe but many, many parallel universes each of which interacts with your present. Most people would have no problem reading this book and coming away with an understanding of why the theory of parallel universes exists.  That is the end of the value of this book... you know about the experiment that was the basis for the theory and how the theory explains that experiment.<br />The remainder of the book is poorly written and hard to follow.  The theoretical underpinnings are put forward and contradicted at various points.<br />For those who want a very basic introduction, not about the theory of parallel universes, but about the experiment that started it all, this is as good an introduction as any other book that I have read.  Not a read for someone who is actually trying to understand the theory and it's implications.	2001-11-01

This book is one of them.  The author is well experienced in this area after giving programs on communications to Microsoft, Motorola and other large companies.<br />The author does a good job of analyzing the basic factors involved in how others act and react to various factors and how to use those same factors to persuade them to action.  Areas covered include motivation, matching your ideas to their needs, developing the relationship, non-verbal communication, handling resistance, influencing groups and writing to persuade.<br />Probably the reason that there are only two reviews is the price tag of the book.  There are other books on the subject of persuasion that are as good and even more up to date at about half the price of this book.  For more up to date coverage at a reasonable price that covers all the items in this book, try some books by Kevin Hogan or David J. Lieberman.	2001-11-01

This book offers a very good overview of the Registry.<br />The book covers common problems, common fixes, how to back it up (very important since a corrupted registry may cause your computer to not be able to start at all), how to restore it and how to backup and restore just certain branches of the registry.  Making changes to the registry is not for the faint-hearted.  Deleting a wrong key, changing the wrong key, or any other change can create havoc for your computer.  The book describes things in sufficient detail to allow you to make changes with confidence and knowing that you can get back to the original registry if something goes wrong.<br />I wish it had more information on how one could identify programs that a particular key is related to.  Why?  Because it is still very, very unusual to find a program that completely removes itself from the registry when you uninstall the program.  These dead parts of the registry make it larger and larger and cause your computer to boot slower and slower and also create more and more places where there may be software conflicts or other items that cause your computer to crash.  In the authors defense I have not been able to find any computer books that cover this topic in any significant manner.  So, it is still click and guess if you want to remove all the threads of a program in the registry.<br />All in all, this is still an excellent book on the registry and a good choice for a computer technician, or the courageous novice, to have on their bookshelf.	2001-11-01

Even a person who lies as a regular pathological pattern shows some sort of stress and physiological reaction.  It is not a quick process but it does show how to determine when a person is under stress. When that stress level changes as a result of a specific question then it is time to determine why there was a stress change.  Were they lying?  Maybe, or maybe it is because there are other stress factors related to the question.<br />The techniques go from learning to spot stress signals and knowing when a stress signal in one person is not a stress signal in another person to how to move to a position of determining the source of the stress.<br />The book also covers knowing when to shut up and let the person's stress levels and psychological state push them to completing a confession.<br />The book deals with questions of how to spot a lie, how to deal with it once it is uncovered, the social implications of lying. The book also covers the common ways that people react to being exposed and how they try to continue the deception.<br />An interesting part of this book is the part where Mr Walters does not let the person being lied to off the hook.  Sometimes the person being lied to is part of the reason for the lie.  Sometimes they set up the situation so that the liar feels they have no choice but to lie.<br />An excellent book on the subject from a highly experienced author, it gives all the foundational knowledge that you need to become an expert.  All you need now is practice.	2001-11-01

But first make sure what you are winning/losing.	This was an excellent book on argumentation skills.  However, first you have to define what it is to win.  What do you want to get from the argument and what are you willing to risk to get that?  Through several examples he works out how to win by losing, how to win by empowering others, how to win by redirecting the prejudice of others or using that prejudice to your advantage, etc.<br />He spends a great deal of time discussing the importance of using stories to illustrate points and does a fine job of it.  The book is filled with stories and experiences from his real life courtroom experiences and how his arguments affected the jury, sometimes in a manner that surprised him and sometimes in the manner he expected.  Even when the results were a surprise he explains why, after thinking about it, the decision went the way it did.<br />The book is highly slanted toward the argument styles of a lawyer in front of a jury.  However, it is useful to anyone in any potentially argumentative situation where a position has to be taken and defended.  How to argue, how to win, when to argue, when to shut up, it all starts with deciding what it is to win and then moving to that point.  It includes sections on arguing in the marriage and the workplace.  The one about handling arguments in a relationship is a particularly interesting chapter.	2001-11-01

Why is it that you still find new buildings going up with a pull bar on a door that needs to be pushed to be opened?  I even encountered a sliding door last week that had a vertical pull bar.  How would a person know by looking at the door that it should be slid instead of pulled?  Of course, you don't know and that is the sort of thing that is covered in this book.  There is really no reason not to make things much easier to use except poor design.<br />How relevant is this book?  I became exposed to it as required reading for computer engineering studies.  Maybe the next generation of designers will be able to think ahead about things and design them better.  Heaven knows it won't hurt Microsoft to have someone who understands a user interface better.<br />So, is it of value to people other than designers?  I think so.  For one thing it has changed the way that I look at things and when choosing a purchase I look at design considerations.  After all, why shouldn't I pick the one that is better designed on the outside?  Maybe that reflects a better design on the inside.  I've even found that I think of things I learned in this book when doing something around the house such as adding a set of doors to enclose my bookcase or when I enclosed my porch.  It has affected a lot of things that I do not to mention it is simply a delightful read and written in a very easy style.	2001-11-01

If you have been using GoldMine and have a good understanding of its purpose and function then there are interesting things in here to help you use it better.  However, if you are not knowledgeable about GoldMine and, as others have indicated here, your boss drops it on your desk and tells you to learn it then this book has minimal value.  Like every other book on GoldMine that I have read, it lacks an integrated approach.<br />The information in the book is good and accurate, but is all scattered pieces of knowledge without any information as to how all of it works together.  Think of it like this, suppose that someone wanted to teach you chess.  They described each and every piece and the board.  They described the manner in which each piece could move and restrictions on movement.  Then they said to go play chess.  You would surely lose if you don't know that the goal is to capture the other king nor how all the pieces work together to create an effective defense or offense.  This book describes how each piece works but not how to get them to work together.<br />Unfortunately I can't point anyone to any other book on GoldMine that does not suffer the same problem.  They describe all the ingredients and how to prepare the ingredients but not how to bake the cake.	2001-10-17

Presented in a fun and light style it is easy to read and presents some interesting items.  I don't really like the title because the items are not really cheap tricks.  They are pieces of information collected from many sources that are at least educational in nature.  There are parts that are very useful and may help each partner understand each other better.  Would I use this to try to save a floundering relationship?  No, but on the other hand, if you are trying to understand each other or get the other person's attention then it has several techniques for that purpose.<br />All in all it is fun and interesting and I enjoyed reading it.  At least when it described some of the ways that men think it was dead on.  Hopefully, it is just as accurate when describing the way that women think and you can gain some understanding of your spouse.	2001-10-17

From my standpoint it was very interesting because in my occupation I am the one who is sent in when a customer is unhappy and have to try to save the project.  I am very successful at that but have had a very hard time training others in how to get to the root of a problem and find a way to work it out to regain a working relationship.  As I read through this book I recognized item after item that I do easily and naturally.  This book finally quantifies those items and does so in a way where a person can train themselves to deal with difficult people or difficult situations.  Of course, it would be even better to know these principles from the beginning so that you don't get into those awkward situations to begin with.<br />Unless you are a complete hermit who does not deal with anyone on a regular basis, this book can prove helpful to you.  Read it, practice it, read it again.  Don't believe the title that this is just about talking your way to the top of an organization, it is an excellent book about communication and getting ahead in all aspects of life.<br />I even passed it along to a teenager who is having problems with social acceptance at his school.  I advised him to pick a chapter and try the techniques in it on purpose for a week, then pick another chapter and concentrate on it for a week.  After three weeks he indicated that people no longer turn away from him when he approaches, say hello to him on the streets, etc.  It is taking hard work for him but the results are nothing short of amazing.<br />I did not care for Chapters 11 and 12 where he moves from communication with and between others to a form of self therapy.  Perhaps others will find it valuable but I did not.  There are better books where the whole book deals with self-talk and personal therapy of various types.  That being said, it is still the best book that I have found on communication skills and how to deal with other people.  It is in fact just what it says, communication secrets to change your life.  It just became required reading for project managers at my company.It is in fact just what it says, communication secrets to change your life.

This is one of the easier books to understand on the zone system.  It does not get too tied up in the details of the system but describes enough detail to allow the reader to understand the basics of the system.  This book is really targeted to someone who is not familiar with the zone system or who has studied it in more complex books and did not really comprehend the system.  For this intended audience the book is right on target.  It takes the complex issues of the zone system and removes the calculations and just gives you what you need to know.  Think of it like the difference between an art teacher who says \\"Color the grass green\\" versus one who says \\"The grass must be green because chlorophyll absorbs the green portion of the light spectrum and so reflected light appears that color\\".  If you just want to know how to use the system without a lot of detail behind why the system works then this is a good book selection for you.	2001-10-02

The high point of this book is the quality of the illustrations.  Between drawn illustrations and large photographs it is easy to follow along.  The knots are correct and the illustrations represent the knots as tied.  This may sound like what you should expect from a knot book but it has been my experience that it is often not the case.  Between books that show the wrong illustration with the knot, leave out a step or suddenly show it from a different direction it is hard to find a good book with these items done correctly.  This book does a great job of getting the illustrations right and is easy enough to follow along with that anyone can be tying knots correctly quickly.  It also includes some knot history and explains how each knot should be used.  A beautifully printed hardback book, I really only had one problem with it.  For several of the knots the illustrations were clear but the method described and illustrated was not the easiest way to tie the knot.  For example, I know of noone who really ties a figure of eight loop using the method indicated.  The end result is the same and so this tying method is valid, but simply not the easiest.  Still, even with a more complex method of tying the knot illustrated it is so well illustrated that you have no problem tying it that way.	2001-10-02

If you are looking for a book that discusses the \\"secret\\" methods or remote viewing or some \\"secret\\" formula for making it work then you will be disappointed in this book.  On the other hand it is not filled with fluff and overly optimistic promises for the reader.  While McMoneagle indicates that pretty much anyone can learn how to do remote viewing, he also is more realistic in terms of what you should expect at different stages.  It is a growth process and he defines how to determine what stage you are at as well as the level of success that you should expect as you get better and better with practice.  If remote viewing works then this is the most realistic book about it that I have seen.  No \\"pie in the sky\\" promises or expectations, quite the opposite he explains that success may be measured in very small successes and even being just plain wrong is going to happen at times.  I think that he tries too hard to make the research appear more scientific than it is.  However, it is probably as close a scientific approach as can be done on this sort of subject.  The parameters for learning remote viewing are spelled out and done in a way that provides a working model for the reader to learn on their own without confusing the claims of publicity and ego-pumping charlatans with what can really be expected to occur.	2001-10-02

The primary value to the book is if you find one or two of the mistakes that you make on a regular basis.  Unfortunately they are then followed by several paragraphs of how to deal with that problem.  There are several full length books available on how to deal with just one of these problems.  It appears that these authors think that in a few paragraphs they can resolve problems that others take a whole book to deal with.  That being said, this book does have a value.  I don't think that I would recommend it to someone who makes one or more of these mistakes on a regular basis and wishes to do something about it.  For them I would suggest a book that deals more directly with their problem. However, it is an enlightening book for people who might read through it and find something that describes them.  That information and the techniques described to help with the situation might be just what they need to go further and seek more thorough help.  It is a good book to help you more clearly define a problem so that you can seek out other appropriate book to treat the problem.	2001-09-28

Tom Sant has put together one of the single best books on proposal writing.  Whether you are responding to a bid request or just designing a basic proposal the book is filled with tips for getting the winning contract.  Everything is covered here.  There are examples of bad proposals and details of what is wrong with them, examples of how to make your proposal stand out from the others and even a primer on the basics of persuasion.  It is well organized and flows well from the beginning to the end of the process not only defining what should be done but why you are doing it.  This knowledge gives you the ability to adapt to unusual situations instead of just using a boilerplate method for all your contracts.  It even comes with a small but thorough checklist in the appendix to make sure that you have left no stone unturned in creating the proposal.<br />There is however, one point that I would like to have seen added to the book.  At the last of the book he emphasizes the importance of editing your proposal.  When you are done then read it again as a whole to see that it contains continuity, check it for spelling errors, check it for grammar errors, etc.  Read it from front to back two or three times to make sure that you catch everything so that you don't lose credibility with your audience.  While I agree totally, on long proposals I also start from the back section and read the sections from back to front.  Why?  As you are rereading for editing your attention to detail tends to decrease and you become more careless after a certain point.  Starting from the back sections gives you a chance to read those sections while still fresh.  Does it work?  Well let's take a look at his book itself.  No errors jump out at me until page 178 where the word \\"about\\" is spelled \\"abut\\".  Well if that is the only problem then he has still done well.  Then I got to page 186 where he has an example of a badly worded item.  After showing the better wording the book states \\"That's a little better, isn't it?  A little easier to understand the first time through?\\"  Obviously he meant to say that it is \\"easier to understand THAN the first time through\\".  And then a third error on page 188 where he is discussing the importance of using \\"complement\\" and \\"compliment\\" correctly.  But during the discourse he actually spells \\"complement\\" as \\"conplement\\".  A perfect discourse that suddenly has three errors within ten pages.<br />This is still a fantastic book on the details of how to write a proposal, things to do, things to avoid, how to persuade, how to focus the proposal or contract, etc.  It belongs on the shelf of anyone who writes proposals and contracts or any form of communication, which involves convincing other people to see your position.  I even successfully used the information in the book to detail the current status and proposed direction of a mishandled project and was able to win the client back and keep the contract.little better, isn't it?

For people like me who love to accumulate useless but fascinating information it is a wonderful book.  It asks the questions (Why do we itch, why are there holes in Swiss cheese, why does an X stand for a kiss, etc....)  and then proceeds to answer them.  If you ever wanted to be a know-it-all (or want your know-it-all to at least have the right answers) then read this book and become the authority on useless information with your family and friends.  Much more fascinating than trivia books (after all you might want to know why cashews are not sold in their shells but who really cares who the runner up for the 1998 Ms America was?).<br />Each piece is a short question and answer so that you could pick it up and read one in a minute or two, but if you are like me then once you have read one you have to keep on reading the next and then the next until you have consumed an hour or more of fascinating reading.	2001-09-12

Pretty much any knot that you are likely to need is here somewhere.  The photographs and the drawings are very good when taken by themselves however the book suffers terribly when it comes to consistency and also leaves a few things out.  For example, it shows a seized half hitch by showing how to tie the half hitch and then saying to &quot;lash small stuff around the ends to secure&quot;.  It does not say how to lash the smaller cord.  Some people would also find it confusing that the illustrations on how to tie a knot sometimes do not match with the photograph of the finished knot.  For example, the half hitch picture shows the standing end of the rope toward you and the illustrations show tieing it with the standing end away from you.  Also the taunt line hitch (an extremely useful knot) in the photograph is around the standing end of the same rope (the most common way of tieing it) and the illustration appears to be tieing it around a pole of some type.  If you already have a basic understanding of knots then it is easy enough to figure out and follow and a good book to use to expand your knowledge of knots.  If you are a complete novice then you may find some difficulty following along but the extra effort is worth it when you get one figured out and tied right.	2001-09-12

Not all the sites are considered sacred from a traditional standpoint but are sacred from the standpoint of moving the observed to a sense of reverence.  From Ayer's Rock in Australia to Machu Picchu in Peru to Glastonbury Tor in England this is a collection of landscape photographs and paintings that are sure to leave a reader with a sense of awe.  With each picture there is also a poem or appropriate prose.  At another time and place they may have been inspirational words but here they only distract.  The last dozen pages of the book contain a few articles about the earth and our responsibilities for the earth and they are excellent articles.<br />This is a book to purchase and keep out in the open where you can open it to a random page and enjoy the beauty that it portrays.

Books	4	16	21	N	N	Interesting book for the open minded	Heroic writer or heretic or somewhere in between, everyone who reads this will place the text into their own category.<br />The primary theme of the book is that Jesus existed as a real person, survived the crucifixion, traveled the East and is buried in Kashmir.  This position is supported throughout the book by various references to historical documents and opinions.  One of the things that I really appreciated is that it has a great number of historical references and pointers to places and specific books where additional information can be obtained.<br />Of course, the author's position represents several theological problems for fundamentalists of various religious persuasions.  The author discusses some of these problems and discusses some of the implications of his position for various religious positions.<br />The author notes that many religious positions are the result of years of dogma and not from careful examination of the many writings of the era.  The author builds his case no only on Biblical references but also on the many, many other writings from the various cultures of the time.  This provides a more complete and balanced picture of the historical Jesus.<br />While I enjoyed the book and found it fascinating reading at points, it does suffer from some logical fallacies.  For example, most of his position is based on writings and commentary of other people's opinions.  Is this accurate?  Who knows?  Just because someone of the time period writes something does not make it factual.  Take for example the history of the United States.  High School textbooks are written by many professional historians but are generally terribly inaccurate.  If some future society were to take what is written in high school history texts as fact they would have a completely erroneous \\"historical\\" understanding of what happened in our country.  (See \\"One Night Stands with American History\\" and \\"Lies my Teacher Told Me\\" for examples).  For an entire argument to be based on earlier writings and opinions is not really an argument at all if the incidents in the writing cannot be confirmed.<br />On the other hand, while I said that most of his opinion is based on earlier writings and opinions, it is not entirely so.  The arguments that the person who was wrapped in the Shroud of Turin survived are excellent and based on good, sound, logical argument.  Other arguments based on semantics are equally convincing. So, some of his points are well argued and compelling.<br />For those who can read this with open and inquisitive mind the book offers an interesting, provocative, and at times compelling argument that Jesus may have survived the crucifixion and indeed have traveled to the East afterward.ed on earlier writings and opinions is not really an argument at all if the incidents in the writing cannot be confirmed. <br />On the other hand, while I said that most of his opinion is based on earlier writings and opinions, it is not entirely so.

It is not a book of dogma but a reference test that defines different ideas, thoughts and traditions.  Most items are short and so it lends itself to just picking up and reading an item or two when you have just a minute or two of free time.  Or read an item or two each morning or evening.  You don't have to follow from beginning to end but can just pick it up and open it to any page and just start reading.<br />Not in depth by any means, it is just what it purports to be a basic tome on basic Biblical literacy.	2001-09-05

For those of you who are familiar with the work of Ansel Adams and his remarkable black-and-white photographs, they are fine examples of the use of the zone system and he was a proponent of the system.<br />Basically it details how to get the right lighting exposure for a photograph.  By dividing the gray scale into eleven segments that are related to f-stops and shutter speeds it teaches how to place your subject in the right zone.  In addition it teaches where the darkest areas should fall, how to determine where the highlights fall, how to compress or expand the zones in development, etc.<br />If you want to rise above the average photographer then knowing how to use the zone system is a requirement.  This is an excellent book on the system and details it's use in an very user friendly manner.	2001-09-05

It was not difficult because of a difficult theme or difficult to understand information, it just plain drags at some places.<br />There were parts where I could not put the book down until I finished the chapter and parts where I could not wade through the chapter except that I was stuck on a plane with nothing better to do.<br />The primary problem is that this book moves from a fascinating book about the errors we are taught in our high school history classes to a sociology text on the plight of black people in today's society and how it relates to the past.<br />The scholarly part of the errors in history were well done and accurate but he apparently moves from his area of expertise in history into an area of sociology where some arguements are interesting but most are a continuous rehash of the same thing over and over.<br />I still would buy the book and recommend it but would have preferred it if he had stayed in the areas of historical inaccuracies and stayed away from extrapolating from those facts to derive social theories.	2001-09-05

It is simply the best book on the subject that I have ever seen.  It goes through the usual informative sections on animal anatomy and several step-by-step demonstrations and details.  It is here where this book stands out, in the detail of the demonstrations.  From detail information on the underpainting technique to detailing, drybrushing and using washes it covers everything in an easy to understand manner.

Albert Allen worked in the 1920s and his book and photographic work reflect the concepts of beauty at that time.  The hairstyles and props as well as the figures reflect the times.  This was a time period when nudes in sculpture and painting were okay but in photography it was not considered art but generally considered pornography.  Albert Allen forged ahead in spite of all of this.  The first part of the book covers his work, ideas (although many of them were quite strange) and photographs that are of an anatomical guide style.  Full frontal and rear photographs of what are mostly slightly overweight models by today's standard of beauty but consistently in line with concepts of beauty during the 1920s.  While a fascinating read and study of Albert Arthur Allen, most of the photography is very average by today's standards.  Then again there were some series that showed true genius in artistic composition and use of light.  A fine example of this is the Alo Studies taken from 1916-1923.  They resemble Maxfield Parrishs work but with nudes.  Instead of a study of nudes like most of the rest of the book they are a study in composition, light and art. If you study Albert Arthur Allen as an artistic study or his life as a study of where photography of nudes as an art form has come from then this is an excellent book.  Even as a study in sociology this is an interesting book to see how concepts of beauty and acceptance of nude photography as an art form have changed over the years.  His concepts of sociology, culture and racial differences and how they affected his photography are fascinating to read.	2001-08-19

It includes sections on skeletal structure, musculature, flexation, and how various poses are affect the illustrating of a human figure. This is not a book on how to draw a likeness of someone in particular but a good study on the human body and a foundation of it's structure and illustration.  If you are looking to draw a likeness then it is still valuable as a basic understanding of anatomy but there are better choices.<br />The book is a good buy for those who are interested in learning underlying anatomy in order to create accurate and detailed illustrations. It is a good buy and I'm sure will be a regular reference for me.	2001-08-19

Bill Lemon takes you through a series of several photographs and for each one he details what he did and how he did it.  The details are complete with not only the camera and film information, but also the details of the lighting, angles, custom development, model selection and posing information.  This is an excellent book to read through and study in order to expand your understanding of model photography.  By including all of the details and what the photographer was thinking and what he would do different after studying the results it provides a great deal of good information from a talented photographer.  It is great study in how to apply the techniques of lighting, camera settings and posing to get the results that you want.  If you want some detail knowledge or have studied lighting and posing and similar areas but are having trouble putting it all together into a comprehensive whole then this book is for you.  My only complaint is that it is too short and I would have loved even more examples of his work.	2001-08-19

It far exceeded my expectations.  I had expected another treatise on the mythology and belief systems of Puranic literature mixed with some way of tying it to today's understanding of life and the cosmos.  Instead it was a very scholarly work that delved into the knowledge of ancient India and how it was expressed in terms of mythology.  The author's interpretation of this mythology brings it into focus and ties it to what we have learned in the field of modern astronomy.  Instead of viewing the Puranic literature as being composed by those who were less knowledgeable and limited in their understanding and superstitious in their ways, his interpretations shows that they had a very advanced understanding of the universe around them.  A little complex and confusing at times, it required rereading of several sections before I really understood how they were tied together.  Not a work that I would recommend to a new-comer to the Puranic literature but a highly recommended volume to anyone with an intermediate knowledge.	2001-06-15

It is a thick volume in comparison to similar books but is filled with useful information.  It details the more common tracking techniques and gives very informative descriptions not only of what you are looking for but why you should look for particular signs and what they mean.  It covers various techniques for various terrain types, surface vegetations and track aging.  All in all one of the best books on tracking that you could purchase today.  I will warn you that while it covers technique and sign reading it does not cover the tracks of various animals to any significant extent, but then again it would be a much larger book if it did and given the thoroughness of the text perhaps a separate book on animal tracks would be warranted.  Unlike most tracking books, it does cover tracking people very well.	2001-06-15

Most of them tend to fall into one of two categories.  Either a treatise on the brain, how memories are formed, the types of memories and the basics of recall or a treatise of memorization techniques that have been used over the centuries.  The first type offers great information but very little useful advice for someone seeking to improve their memory.  The second type offers lots of techniques that may work in one situation or another but don't give enough information on how they work to allow you to adapt them to your own personal needs.<br />This book offers a nice medium ground.  It offers information on the various types of memories and current scientific research into memory and then follows up with several types of techniques to enable you to remember different things.  The advantage to this book is that since it gives you both pieces information in a concise, integrated work it provides you with the framework to design and/or adjust the techniques to your personal needs.<br />The book does not offer any new mnemonic techniques or any groundbreaking work in that area.  However, I found that by understanding how the techniques work and how to work with them I was able to adapt the systems and/or use multiple systems to quickly memorize material that had been problematic before.<br />The book covers basic systems from the common Loci system that is quick and easy to learn to the much more flexible and complex phonic system that requires much more study and practice to use effectively.  While these are not new, a work that details the manner in which they work and encourages you to adapt the system to your needs is new.  This is definitely one of the best single books that I have read on the subject and was immediately useful.<br />The only thing that I did not like about the book was the great multitude of references to other works, systems, and detailed applications of the system to various specific situations.  The references are not a problem in themselves as they do not break up the flow of the book and are summarized at the end of the book in an easy to read fashion.  The problem is that while they point out where information came from they do not point out where to get your hands on the information.  This has not been a problem for me in the past as I have generally not really cared to follow up to the original source of footnotes and references.  But this book was so well done that I found myself often wanting to follow up with the references and not able to locate them.  For example, in Chapter 12 he mentions a book and a game that contain 1,200 Bible verses set out with mnemonic devices to help learn them and where they are located in the Bible.  After a couple of examples to whet your appetite the only information in the reference material related to the footnote is where the book can be purchased.  Not even a mention of the book's name if one should desire to purchase it.  No mention of the game name nor where one might find it.  Of course it may not be too difficult to locate if you had a name for the game or book or anything else other than just the publisher.m to various specific situations.
