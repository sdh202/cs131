This planet is being settled by humans, but there have been some very odd children born...<br />A rather dark book, with hints at the worst aspects of eugenics, it at the same time manages to be rather touching.  The struggles of not only the TARDIS crew but also the parents of one of the mutant children against the planetary government focus in on the inhumanity of which humans are capable.<br />Exactly how the situation arose is the central mystery to the book, and its slow unfolding is the central driving force of the novel's latter narrative.<br />This is Steve Emmerson's second Doctor Who novel, and confirms that his first was not just a flash in the pan.	2001-09-15

Investigating a series of strange events, the Brigadier pulls out a long unused device which sends a signal to the Doctor - in this case, in his sixth incarnation.  What is the mystery that unites a spaceship shot down over England in 1944, strange demonic figures hidden in the shadows, and the final fate of Adolph Hitler?<br />Apparently written in three weeks when another book became unavoidably delayed, this book unites the current and previous editors of BBC's Doctor Who line of novels in a surprisingly well thought-through that combines fact and fiction into a coherent whole, while containing several plot twists that you probably won't see coming.<br />There is something about British writers which results in Hitler being portrayed as something more than just an evil dictator - and this book is no different.  The combination of extreme disgust and morbid fascination adds some fuel to the already volatile mixture.<br />For a book of its pedigree (which would be a hastily bred mongrel), this is surprisingly good.	2001-09-15

Sarah Jane Smith is seeking stories in South East Asia, and finds herself pursuing colourful pieces relating to the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule.  But is the strange little man with underworld connections who runs the Pimms Corporation really her old friend the Doctor?<br />This novel is more a story of investigative journalist and former travelling companion Sarah than it is of the Doctor.  Indeed, the Doctor's role is far more reminiscent of that he played when Who novels were produced by Virgin: a shadow figure, inclined to manipulate events from the background.<br />But the book doesn't suffer for that. Sarah is a strong character, well able to carry a large portion of the story, and we, as readers, get to see the Doctor's actions as most in the real world would - like observing a great storm from a distance, seemingly calm at first until it breaks with great force on the landscape.<br />Given the relative failure of teaming up a companion with a different Doctor seen in 'Asylum', it was good to see David McIntee carry this off successfully.  I have no inherent problem with old companions being reused, but unless it adds substantially to both the returning character and the story, there isn't much point.  In this case, Sarah's livelihood as a journalist is an important element in the Doctor's plan and is also the reason for her involvement, making the pairing seem quite reasonable.<br />With more than a nod to the oeuvre of James Bond, this book stands out stylistically from many recent books in the series, and again demonstrates the flexibility of the series' format.	2001-09-15

Villains from the past return, and this book includes some essential stories of Spidey's big name foes, Dr  Octopus and the Green Goblin.<br />The book also takes Peter Parker from his high school days to college, incidentally introducing both Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson while leaving behind earlier romantic interests such as Betty Brant and Liz Allen.<br />During this volume, we see the period when artist Steve Ditko took over the plotting of stories, which lent the book a more moralistic air.  Towards the end, Ditko leaves and is replaced by John Romita, making the book more clean-lined but less visually interesting.<br />This volume is a mixed bag, albeit of good quality material, and shows a comic that has largely outgrown its original premise but struggling to find a new one.	2001-09-07

In this book, Mrs Hudson and Mrs Warner are called into investigate the murder of Edgar Bramwell, a rich industrialist, who died mysteriously at a party at his home.  Despite the fact that there were six other people the room, no-one remembers how it happened...<br />The third book in this series (preceded by 'Elementary, Mrs Hudson' and 'Murder, Mrs Hudson'), this series has settled down nicely.  Originally, I had problems with Mrs Warner's astral projection, and fortunately it only gets a passing mention in this book.  The strength of Sidney Hosier's writing is in the portrayal of the characters, and Mrs Watson and Mrs Warner are well delineated.<br />The slow and steady unfolding of the plot is, however, a little less satisfactory.  The murder and its cause are pretty obvious from the start, even if they hadn't been given away in the blurb.  Early in the book, a character is introduced who will point the sleuths in the right direction, which makes it seem a little contrived.<br />However, there are a few twists that aren't immediately obvious, and the book itself is written in a sufficiently pleasing way to make this a relaxing read.  Just don't pick it up if you want to be strongly challenged!	2001-09-03

In a somewhat unsystematic purging, many classics were consigned to the flames, including several Doctor Who stories. Fortunately, some fans of the series had made their own audio recordings, and these (following a thorough re-mastering by the BBC) are being released.<br />'The Macra Terror' is one of these releases. The story features a human colony under siege from a race of monsters - not an unusual description of a Patrick Troughton story. What makes this story unique is the nature of the colony - set up like an archetypical British holiday camp, the enforced bon hommie and cheerful tunes cast it in a different light. (This kind of society was revisited some 21 years later in the Sylvester McCoy story 'The Happiness Patrol'.)<br />The comparatively recent addition of Jamie to the TARDIS crew mean that all three companions (the other two being Ben and Polly) have smaller roles than might be desirable. The Doctor is very much on centre stage in this story, and Pat Troughton is well in his stride in the part.<br />Linking narration is by Colin Baker, who played the Doctor's sixth incarnation, and is surprisingly subdued given Baker's portrayal of the Doctor. The visual aspects of the show would probably added quite a bit to the enjoyment of the show (particularly in setting the holiday camp tone), but based on stills the appearance of the Macra is probably not truly missed.<br />The story is quite strong and not unduly tied in to the shows ongoing history, so is suitable for both fans and casual listeners.	2001-09-02

Following an outrageous crime in Paris, where a criminal claiming to be Sherlock Holmes plays an pivotal role, the real Great Detective and his trusty biographer head off to the continent where things are far more complex than they first appear...<br />John Hall writes a reasonable Holmes book, relying upon the known plans of Professor Moriarty and featuring the French thief, Arsene Jupin, in a strong supporting role.<br />His writing plays to a desirable strength: Holmes and Watson are truly portrayed as detectives, accumulating clues and investigating leads, as they try to uncover exactly who is behind the plot and where to find him.  In this quest they utilise both the services of the French Surete and the contacts they develop in the underworld.  However, the relative ease with which they move through the organisation of the French master criminal makes him seem a little less formidable than would be desirable.<br />There is nothing wrong with the portrayal of Holmes and Watson, but be the same token they are not very exciting or notable.<br />Arsene Jupin (as Arsene Lupin is called here) is a bit bland.  Lupin, as originally portrayed, had a bit of a hard edge that reduced as his stories went along.  The portrayal here is Lupin at his most boring.<br />A reasonable read for Holmes fans, not so interesting for those who want to read Lupin.	2001-08-18

Initially, he appears to be an asset that everyone wants, but the long-hinted at power of Akira is slowly awakened as the story progresses.<br />The awakening of Akira changes the whole nature of the story.  Both in the content and in the illustrations, you can see that a very large change has come to the world, and that things won't be the same again.<br />And speaking of the illustrations: the sheer scope of the story is well captivated by Katsuhiro Otomo's art.  Quite, quite spectacular.<br />At the end of this volume, we are halfway through the six volumes of this epic story.  From my uncertain beginnings, I'm now sure I'll be following this through to the end.	2001-08-17

The characters are many and varied, some of whom have powers, some have super-science weaponry, some are simply people in costumes.  With a whole city of super-beings, we have normal jobs being carried out by people in costumes.  For example, the book begins with fears about the return of the Libra Killer, who in previous years has killed and decapitated prostitutes.  In Neopolis, the prostitutes have super powers, and these are used to play to their clients peccadilloes.<br />Then there is the murder investigation of the death of the Norse god of beauty, Baldur.  Boy, his relatives are an odd bunch - his father Woden, mother Frey, brothers Thunor and Hod, and uncle Lokk may help redefine your view of the Norse gods, especially if you read that other comic with Norse gods...<br />More fun is had by artists Gene Ha and Zander Cannon.  Look closely - you'll find possibly recognisable characters in all sorts of odd circumstances.  My favourite, possibly, is someone who looks like Charlie Brown in a Doctor Doom costume!  How much of this is from Alan Moore's scripts is another question...<br />If I have a problem it is that there is so much happening, so many throw away pieces, so many characters...  It's a little too much.  But then, you can read it over and over again for more detail.	2001-07-29

When I reviewed the first volume in this series, I described the general idea in the following way: 'Promethea' is an attempt to render the female super hero in an archetypical form.  This book has a strong mystical or spiritual theme, with the female lead cast in a pluralistic role: she is both Sophie Bangs, student, and Promethea, imagination personified.  Our Promethea is not the first, there is a whole line of Prometheas stretching back to ancient Egypt, and we get to know some of the earlier ones in this book.<br />This volume collects issues 7 through 12 of the series.  If anything, it tops the previous volume.<br />Alan Moore and JH Williams III are firing on all cylinders here - we get quite a detailed examination of spiritual themes, contrasted and compared to quantum physics; some superheroing; one of the most sensual comics you're likely to see, and a diverse cast of characters.	2001-07-29

And what a debut!  A vital utilisation of the time travel concept underlying the series, a fairly complex plot that slowly unravels as the story continues.<br />One of Ms Orman's strong points is characterisation, and this is on display herein.  However, she is not yet at the height of her writing powers in this book, good though it is.  You should give this, and any other books by the same author, a thorough read.	2001-07-29

In a somewhat unsystematic purging, many classics were consigned to the flames, including several Doctor Who stories.  Fortunately, some fans of the series had made their own audio recordings, and these (following a thorough re-mastering by the BBC) are being released.<br />'Galaxy 4' is one of these releases.  The first story of Doctor Who's third season, it is largely a parable of not judging by appearances.  The TARDIS lands on a desert planet, and the crew are almost immediately captured by a robot called, by Vicki, a Chumbly.  They are rescued but captured by the beautiful Drahvins, a race of female clones.<br />The planet has &quot;four hundred dawns&quot; before it explodes.  The Drahvins demand the aid of the TARDIS crew in eliminating their foes, the Rills, and capturing the Rills' functioning spaceship.  The Rills are hidden in their spaceship while their robots, the Chumblies, carry out their work.  The Drahvins say they are hideous.<br />Captured by one side or the other of the conflict at various points, the Doctor and his companions discover that the &quot;four hundred dawn&quot; estimate is vastly overstated...<br />In some respects, 'Galaxy 4' is an odd choice to release on CD.  The comparison of the physical appearance of the Drahvins and the Rills is not possible, and indeed the Rills are largely undescribed.  The linking narrative, read by Peter Purves who plays the Doctor's companion Steven, does its job and listeners should have no problem in following the fairly simple story.  However, it is neither important to the series as a whole or a particularly outstanding example of Doctor Who in 1965, so probably one for the Doctor Who fans rather than the casual listener.	2001-07-29

Roy Thomas is now the writer, and is plainly undertaking the work with enthusiasm and a desire to create something very much worth reading.<br />This volume sees the membership of the team in flux, with characters being added and removed, and some not even officially joining the team.  The stories themselves see members departing for personal reasons, and older members, who are technically off the team, dropping by.<br />It also sees the introduction of some elements that continue to have impact today: the first two conflicts with Ultron, the introduction of the Vision, Hank Pym taking up the identity of Yellowjacket, the Scarlet Centurion, the conflicts of loyalty that beset the Scarlet Witch and, in particular, Quicksilver...<br />Art-wise, we are generally in the safe and capable hands of John Buscema, although there are a couple of issues illustrated by Barry (Windsor) Smith, who will soon go on to greater things...  Also present are Don Heck, Gene Colan and Sal Buscema.<br />The stories still show the elements of a relatively new writer working out what works and what doesn't in this format.  However, they become increasingly self-assured towards the end, and Volume 4, when it is released, will show a far more mature writer...	2001-07-16

This party, though, is about to gatecrashed by the Valethske, a race of vulpine hunters.  But even they are no threat compared to the past of xenologist Aline Vehlmann...<br />With his third Doctor Who novel, Nick Walters assembles a promising cast and some excellent concepts, but sadly fails to deliver what should have been a good book.<br />One of the principle problems is that he builds and builds and builds the story but, like many readers, I expect pay-offs along the way.  While things happen that appear to be meant to be pay-offs, they don't feel that way to me.<br />I also found myself asking &quot;so when does the main part of the story begin?&quot;, and when your doing that 100 pages into a 280 page novel you have to wonder.<br />Mr. Walters two previous novels, 'The Fall of Yquatine' and 'Coldheart', seemed better plotted and constructed than this, which is a bit sad as I think the ideas behind this novel were excellent.<br />In particular, I'd be happy to see the Valethske come back for a second appearance.	2001-07-15

The human colony is largely based around the production of music, and the dominant native life-form, which closely resembles the terran tiger, seems harmless and friendly.  With perfect weather all year round, it seems like the perfect refuge.  But then...<br />When you run through the list of Doctor Who authors, there are a few whose work receives almost universal praise.  Kate Orman (with or without her husband, Jon Blum) is one of them.<br />Yet again Kate has written a book based around a believable alien world, and while it has a strong story-line, the reader is most likely to take away memories of the excellent portrayal of the characters.  Kate's take on the current Doctor, still with amnesia for events preceding the novel 'The Burning', is a very strong one, full of an enormous passion for life and a towering humanity.  Her interpretation of both Fitz and Anji are great, and each is explored and moved forward in this book.  And then there are all the many characters who may very well appear in this book only, who are nevertheless given very effective life.<br />Beyond that, with this story set on a world where music is held in high regard, it is great to read musical ideas being constantly brought up within the context of the book.  A devotion to music is a strong part of the characters, and so it is natural that it should be reflected in the way that many of the characters respond to the events of this book.<br />And then there are the tigers... About whom I'll say nothing more than their characterisation was also brilliant.  Read the book to see what I mean!<br />I was also pleased to see Kate take one of the oft-used situations from the TV series, where the Doctor is forced to choose between the humans and the non-humans, and firstly give it a serious spin and then bounce it out the door.  Things become clichés through overuse, but can be redeemed by turning them on their heads.  Kate more than does this.<br />I could rave on and on for hours about this book, but that's not really the point.  All I'll say is this: you'll be doing yourself a favour by reading it.	2001-07-15

Buoyed by the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel looked around for a new hero to star in their comics.  They introduced Spider-Man as a test in the last issue of Amazing Fantasy, found him popular, and released him in his own title.  This volume collects that first appearance, the first 20 issues of Amazing Spider-Man, and the first annual of that title.<br />In this volume you see the writing powerhouse of Stan Lee churning out many and great ideas very quickly, while ensuring that appropriate attention is given to the human interest/soap opera aspects of the title.  It is these aspects that helped to differentiate the Marvel range from its competitors, and you won't find them done better than in the beginnings of Spider-Man. <br />Artistically we have Steve Ditko at the helm.  Mentioned far less than the burgeoning talent of Jack Kirby, Ditko turns in some amazing pieces in this volume.  Tending towards the outré, it is in the occasional gothic pieces (like the first appearance of the Lizard in issue 6) that seem to me the most powerful.  However, Ditko is a much subtler artist than many of his contemporaries, and treasures of illustration turn up all the time.  It is possible that these touches are more visible in this black and white reprint.<br />And then there's the characters...  Sometimes clichéd, occasionally even bad (if I never see the Ox, Montana and Fancy Dan again it won't be too soon), the vast majority are dynamic and memorable.  In this volume, you can read the first appearances of the Vulture, Dr Octopus, the Sandman, the Lizard, Electro, Mysterio, the Green Goblin, Kraven the Hunter and the Scorpion - villains who still return almost 40 years later.  And the supporting cast: J Jonah Jameson, Aunt May, Flash Thompson...  This was the time when the Spider-Man mythos was laid down, and it continues to be influential today.  (Other important aspects, like Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Osbornes don't appear in this volume - but they will soon.)<br />The classic stories of one of the greatest comics characters.

Something has happened in the past, and the Silurians rule the world...<br />A sort-of sequel to the TV serial 'The Silurians' (novelised under the name 'The Cave Monsters'), this novel is the first in a sequence of five (the remainder being 'The Dimension Riders', 'The Left-Handed Hummingbird', 'Conundrum' and 'No Future') which sees the Doctor and companions dealing with threats that tie into the Doctor's past, and that have a single for behind them all.<br />Having said that, this novel does stand on its own, and is set in a world where the Doctor was slain towards the end of 'The Silurians', and looks at what might have happened under those circumstances.  It features the return of old allies the Brigadier, Liz Shaw and Jo Grant and puts an interesting twist on the lives of those people.<br />It is not, however, simply wallowing in the series' past.  There are numerous new elements, the ongoing character development of the Doctor, Ace and Benny continues, and the story climaxes in a moral dilemma that drives further wedges between the companions.<br />Jim Mortimore uses this book to explore the &quot;might have beens&quot; of the Who universe, doing an excellent job while reinforcing what we already know and accept about the series.	2001-07-08

Barbara is dead, from radiation poisoning acquired on Skaro.  And then there are two surprises: the universe outside the TARDIS has ceased to exist, and Barbara turns up, surprised that Ian is alive - he'd died in an adventure with Alexander the Great.  Something is going wrong here...<br />'Campaign' was originally advertised as being published by BBC as part of their Past Doctor series, and then it vanished from the schedule.  Both Jim Mortimore and BBC have been quiet as to why.  Mr. Mortimore has published this book himself, and the book advises &quot;Proceeds from this book will be donated to the Bristol Area Down Syndrome Association&quot;.  I guess it is open to speculation as to why BBC chose not to publish it, and how much it may have been changed after that decision.<br />'Campaign' is certainly not a normal Doctor Who book.  The universe is gone, and within the TARDIS things are going on in a strange fashion.  Like the short story collection 'Short Trips and Side Steps', this book is not unduly concerned with sticking to the established Who canon.  Indeed, Mr. Mortimore liberally plunders from early Doctor Who proposals (the names of companions Ian, Barbara and Susan change to other proposed names) as well as early published Who (Susan is sometimes referred to with the surname English, as she had in the first Doctor Who novelisation; Doctor Who's grandchildren from the comic strips, John and Gillian, also turn up).<br />The novel is about perception and theories of multiple universes as much as it is an adventure novel.  And despite a degree of fluidity around the characters' identities, there is an ongoing storyline that progresses and comes to a conclusion during the book.<br />Tending to a more avant garde presentation, this book is probably not for every Doctor Who fan, but is likely to contain features that may appeal to readers who would not normally read a Doctor Who book.<br />An oddity.An interesting experiment.

He also wrote a book called (somewhat unoriginally) 'Cybermen', which detailed the history of the silver giants.<br />Now, as a writer, Mr Banks makes a great actor...  Unfortunately, the text is slow moving and the characters largely uninspiring.  The end result is somewhat uninvolving, and unfortunately bogged down in cyberhistory.<br />The most redeeming feature is journalist Ruby Duvall, a character who was a possibility for a future companion.  But sadly, this was not to be.	2001-06-30

While the Doctor is resting in his room, the TARDIS is blown apart and two halves of the ship arrive in two separate times and places: with Benny at the beginning of the 20th century, and with Ace in the 220th century.  Without the Doctor, how will they reassemble the TARDIS?<br />This book is set concurrently with Iceberg, where the Doctor has an adventure without his companions.  With two very strong character as Bernice and Ace, it is possible to write a novel without the series' lead character.<br />Nigel Robinson's second original Doctor Who novel is an improvement on his first (Timewyrm: Apocalypse), which seemed too bland for my tastes.  By focussing in on the two companions, amongst the most popular in the series history, and having two interesting and strangely linked settings, he appears to have hit upon a combination that suits him.	2001-06-23

He warns them that they are under attack, and they are soon facing his old foe, the Toymaker.  A being of immense power, they must play the Toymaker's games and win or become his toys forever...<br />This audio story is the soundtrack of a mostly lost TV serial (only the final episode remains of the four that were made).  It takes otherwise familiar children's games like blind man's buff and changes them to something threatening.<br />What is unfortunate is that this conversion is not entirely successful: many of the games seem annoying, and Steven and Dodo's complaints that the Toymaker's pawns are cheating sounds very whiny.  With William Hartnell on holidays for the middle two episodes, we are denied of his usual dominance of the proceedings to make the story come alive.  And then there's the Toymaker, who would almost seem to be a refugee from the TV version of Batman with Adam West!<br />Conceptually good, but the execution is pretty poor.	2001-06-23

It is not what they expect...<br />On close review, this novel by first-time author Christopher Bulis doesn't necessarily have much outstanding about it.  It is a pretty standard sort of story, the kind that Doctor Who has been filled with.  This is not, by the way, a bad thing - while we may hope for outstanding stories, they wouldn't be outstanding if we didn't have the more run-of-the-mill to compare them to.<br />The novel, however, isn't poor.  Some of the characterisation could be better, the plotline improved, but these are not unexpected thins in a first novel.<br />I did enjoy the ultimate baddy of this novel, I'm not sure why.  The fact that I did, however, did raise this novel up a bit for me.	2001-06-16

The concentration on local Haitian politics and zombis that initially dominate the book are both the surface manifestations of two much larger matters that reveal themselves as the book progresses.<br />While well-thought through, the actual drama is not well-portrayed in this book.  Matters arise and are fairly quickly and routinely resolved, and hence it fails to draw the reader in.  Had Mr. McIntee had more experience, this would have been a better book.	2001-06-10

In a somewhat unsystematic purging, many classics were consigned to the flames, including several Doctor Who stories.  Fortunately, some fans of the series had made their own audio recordings, and these (following a thorough re-mastering by the BBC) are being released.<br />'The Highlanders' is one of these releases.  The story occurs at a crucial point in the show's history.  The role of the Doctor has changed hands to Patrick Troughton, and this is his second story.  In the first story, Troughton had the support of the Daleks as his opponents.  This story is also Doctor Who's last regular historical, which were proving less popular than the pure science fiction ones (at least with the production team!), and introduced Jamie who became a regular companion.  In short, the show was in transition.<br />'The Highlanders' is a good story.  The four regulars (The Doctor, Jamie, Ben and Polly) all have strong roles, with the Doctor taking a slightly back-seat role which is consistent with his general portrayal.  While the setting of the story (the aftermath of the Battle of Culloden) is a pretty grim one, the story manages some humorous moments such as the Doctor's penchant for disguises and accents.  These are temporary features which would probably have worn very thin if they had been retained as regular parts of the Doctor's character.<br />Linking narration is by Frazer Hines, who portrayed Jamie, and of course helps to fill in the details that the original television show would have displayed.  It is a very good choice for audio release, and should suit both fans and casual listeners.	2001-06-10

In a somewhat unsystematic purging, many classics were consigned to the flames, including several Doctor Who stories.  Fortunately, some fans of the series had made their own audio recordings, and these (following a thorough re-mastering by the BBC) are being released.<br />'The Massacre' is one of these releases. This story is a historical, set in Paris in 1572.  The entire tone of the story is dark, with doom hanging over the proceedings as the story moves towards the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day.<br />The Doctor and his companion, Steven Taylor, are separated in the first episode and Steven becomes the main character in the story.  This is fairly unusual as, since, apart from the first few stories, it is the Doctor and not his companions who are firmly placed on centre stage.  This situation leads to a twist: another character, the Abbot of Amboise, looks exactly like the Doctor.  Steven is believes he is the Doctor in disguise, but the people around Steven regard his as a villain.  Who is correct?<br />This makes 'The Massacre' an odd choice to release on CD.  The first appearance of the Abbot is a non-vocal one, so unlike the television watchers at the time of its release, we only know this thanks to the linking narration (provided by Peter Purves, who plays Steven).  Given the very different approach that William Hartnell takes for the Doctor and the Abbot, the lack of visuals to emphasise this detracts from the story.<br />For people not used to Doctor Who's early historical stories, this one is perhaps a little grim.  However, as a story showing the power of events and their capacity to crush whoever gets in their way, it is excellent.  This is a story where the Doctor is not the superhuman that some later stories portray him as.	2001-06-10

Stan even appeared to realise that as, part of the way through this volume, a new writer was brought in: Roy Thomas.<br />Roy has shown himself to be a great writer of this form, but his first few stories don't really show him at his best.  I believe that this was amongst his first published work.<br />On the plus side, however, the characterisation improves vastly, with some of the cast becoming easily distinguishable by their dialogue alone, a vast improvement from the period where all the characters spoke the same.<br />Not a showcase of the greatest Avengers issues, but of a period of transition.  Things were better before this, and also improve after.	2001-06-10

Some secrets from the past of recently returned companion Ace will lead to as many complications as the lost history of the previous inhabitants of Lucifer...<br />This book sees the debut of two authors who will return to write further books in this series solo.  And an interesting debut it is, too...<br />Drawing extensively on ideas from both the original TV series and the novels, it contains an original story which sets in place a number of features which will form a backbone for the Virgin Doctor Who range.  It expands on the idea of the Guild of Adjudicators, members of which will be allies and enemies of the TARDIS crew in both the New and Missing Adventures ranges, and draws together elements that have been used in the past into a more coherent view of the universe.<br />As well as doing that, the Doctor, Ace and Benny find themselves and a complex and convoluted plot which will add to the tension already existing between them.  This particular thread runs for many books, which is a good thing in terms of the depiction of the characters, but can be a little unpleasant for the reader.<br />If this book has a major flaw, it is that it suffers from being a first novel.  It is longer than it might be, and contains some extraneous elements that the authors might have removed without any harm to the book.<br />However, it is a book that certainly does reveal the potential of the two authors which bore better fruit in their future works.	2001-06-10

Ace has been away from the TARDIS for three years when events and time conspire to make her desire to return to the Doctor.  Using a piece of technology, she links to the TARDIS, but one much changed from her time there: the Doctor has lost his memory and Benny is in hiding for her own safety...<br />This book is a bit of a worry.  It's purpose appears to simply be to return Ace to the TARDIS crew and to tell a mildly Dalek-related story (odd, since Virgin didn't have the rights to use the Daleks in their books...).  It also features Absolom Daak, a charcter from the Doctor Who comic series, who is a Dalek Killer!<br />Despite all these Dalek-related issues, the story has little to do with them. Instead we are served up what amounts to a generic Who opponent, who is defeated in a generic Who way.<br />A lack of true creativity dooms this book to being, at best, a second-string novel in the long line.	2001-06-02

There is something on the loose, and it has affected some wasps.  They attack people, endeavoring to force themselves into their victims' mouths...<br />Not a book for those of very delicate stomachs, this story pits the TARDIS crew against a bizarre threat.  With a moderate size cast, exactly what is going on will not be obvious at the start.  And there are secrets in the pasts of the inhabitants of the village of Marpling which make matters even more complicated.<br />Like some Agatha Christie books, the number of suspects is slowly whittled down as the story progresses.  This seems more that reasonable, given the number of contemporaneous Christie mysteries set in English villages in the 30s...<br />Not afraid to concentrate on the more gruesome aspects of the story, Trevor Baxendale constructs a story whose difficulties increase as time passes.  If you have rad previous book from this author's pen, I believe this is better than his prevous work.	2001-06-01

The stories are read by Baker or his major companion, Nicola Bryant who played Peri in the series.<br />The longest story, 'Moon Graffiti' is read by both, and features a small amount of acting out of scenes as opposed to the straight narration of the other two stories.  It is also my favourite of the three.  This is a story which competes favourably with the best of Baker's televised stories, and the interaction between the two actors increases enjoyment.  In the far future, the Earth has been invaded by the Pararachnids and humanity has been driven underground.  The title derives from the disfiguration to the lunar surface visible from the Earth's surface.  The travellers are on Earth for a particular reason, but are caught up in events surrounding the conflict between humans and Pararachnids.<br />'Wish You Were Here' is, in my view, the worst of the three.  Read by Baker alone, it epitomises some of the worst aspects of the show's history.  Clichéd characters responding in questionable ways.  As an Australian, I was particularly annoyed by K'Tarth from &quot;the Aussie colony&quot;.  It tries to hard to be funny to succeed.  Probably the best aspect is Baker's narration.<br />'Vigil', read by Bryant alone, is quite a good story from which the collection takes its name.  The Doctor and Peri become involved in parallel and slightly linked adventures.  Both are confronted by the outcomes of their own actions, and the emotional content of the story is the highest on the collection.<br />If nothing else, listeners get to hear Baker and Bryant's vocal interpretation of each other's characters, which are sometimes amusing.  But this, like the collection overall, is really for Doctor Who fans more than casual listeners.	2001-05-27

Nyssa once travelled with the Doctor, but the Doctor who arrives is from a time before he met her!  It seems that something bizarre is happening in regard to the accomplishments of Roger Bacon, and so the Doctor heads for Oxford in 1278, little realising Nyssa has stowed away...<br />Introducing a companion into a story out of sequence is not something that happens often in Doctor Who, and adds a level of complexity to this novel with Nyssa carefully avoiding giving anything away about the Doctor's future.<br />And herein lies the problem: why make a book more complex for no very good reason?  Nyssa's presence adds little to the story, and she behaves in a way that is somewhat at odds with her established character.  While we have seen her tired and frustrated before, we have never seen her give up on everything!<br />Nyssa aside, the story largely progresses as a mediaeval murder mystery (along the lines of 'The Name of the Rose' and various detective series set in mediaeval times), and is not a bad sample of that genre.<br />Peter Darvill-Evans includes a lengthy afterword entitled 'A History of Errors and Falsifications' in which he details the trials and tribulations of an author trying to be both historically accurate and readable at the same time.<br />Overall, I found this book a pleasant distraction, not overly challenging or earth shattering, but perhaps a novel that belongs better in another genre without the Doctor Who trappings.	2001-05-27

Holmes soon recognises one of the lieutenants of the late Professor Moriarty as the hand behind the actions, but how does this tie in with the strange religious ceremonies they encounter?<br />Barrie Roberts turns out a good Holmesian pastiche, but this one misses the mask for me.  The storyline ties in with British history, Arthurian legends, sites of historical interest and more.  As such, I felt curiously uninvolved - the story proceeded without me finding a strong handle on which I could grab hold.<br />Because the subject matter is outside my areas of knowledge, I can't say how impressive the deductions of Holmes are, and so the story also fails here for me.<br />The depiction of Holmes and Watson seem quite true to their original portrayals.<br />I think the book works fine, but it may be more suitable to readers other than me.	2001-05-19

The adventure takes place in a society that has been shaped by a very strong religion, a religion that offers truth to its adherents.<br />And the outcasts of this society also play an important role in the book.<br />Steve Cole is a writer who produces a reasonable book, but seems to achieve better results with a partner.

It is certainly more action-packed than the first, although this shouldn't be confused with having no story.  This would have been easy to do, but the story is progressing, although slower than it might be expected by the pace of the action.  I'm sure others may have been tempted to tell the story in less space, concentrating on action.<br />Several of the characters from the first volume are prominently on display, including several who were somewhat in the background last time.  I expect that some characters will fade into the background, while others become more prominent.<br />Last volume, I suggested that I wasn't certain if I'd go the distance with this story.

But they are not alone on the planet: some temporally displaced commuters, a troop of Chelonians, and the galaxy's most renowned criminal and his gang have arrived through one method or another, and conflict is looming...<br />'The Highest Science' is a fun adventure story, with humorous trappings wrapped around a serious core.  The displaced groups have very different cultures, and their interactions with the Doctor and Benny are interesting to watch.  And then there are the plot twists...<br />For readers of Doctor Who books published by Virgin, this one does a very important thing: it introduces the Chelonians, a  race of cybernetically enhanced giant hermaphroditic turtle (no, I'm not joking).  Hugely threatening and bizarrely humorous by turns, this race are a masterful creation who turn up in several more novels.  Quite frankly, they're worth the price of admission alone.<br />This is Gareth Roberts first novel, and a very accomplished one it is too.

So, in the debut issue, we have Thor, Iron Man, the Hulk, Ant-man and the Wasp joining forces as an unexpected consequence of a plot by Loki against his half-brother, Thor.<br />However, the ideas changed quickly as the Hulk left and teamed-up with the Sub-mariner to fight his former allies and was replaced by Captain America, a World War 2 hero frozen between then and the 60s.  And then again, to suddenly have all the original members depart, leaving Cap with Hawkeye, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, three super-villains seeking to reform, as his teammates.<br />The stories in this volume represent a fairly diverse bunch, showing both the best and worst aspects of Stan Lee's writing at the time.  Interesting team dynamics, where the characters are not always each others' friends, villains with motives beyond the banal, references to events in other titles, secrets and subplots that aren't resolved in a single story all show the hallmarks of a writer seeking to develop a loyal following.  At the same time, we have blatant sexism and racism, villains with banal motives and some very hokey dialogue.<br />The art is OK, the early Jack Kirby issues not his best work, and I've never been fond of Don Heck's art.  It seems a little odd to be reading these stories in black and white, although this obviously keeps the price down.<br />If you want to see how one of the best super-hero team series started out, get this.	2001-05-05

But it is not only the dead who are on Heaven: there are also the living, and something in between, an ancient terror whose activities on Heaven are the reason for the Doctor's visit...<br />The books prior to this in Virgin's Doctor Who series were an extension of the TV series (although people would argue about how successful they were).  Here, the Virgin New Adventures start firmly establishing their own style here.<br />The book also sees the introduction of the first new companion created for the books - Bernice Summerfield, a professor of archaeology.

Unfortunately, it may take these influences too far - the jump cuts, the deliberate obfuscation, the subplots that go nowhere...  This makes it a somewhat difficult read.<br />Having said that, the novel introduces Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart, a popular continuing character in the series.  While Kadiatu's presence is welcome, the portrayal of Benny is problematic: this is her second story, and she spends most of it possessed by an alien intelligence.<br />Between the non-portrayal of Benny and the very dense text, this book is something of a challenge, and probably best left to Doctor Who enthusiasts.	2001-04-26

The days of fighting imaginary monsters are long gone, and Edmund has settled down in a sleepy village.

And then they meet the psychics...<br />The second in the loose Cat's Cradle trilogy, and the first in the War trilogy (the three books in which occur a long way apart), this story portrays a much darker future than those traditionally shown in the Doctor Who TV series.<br />Back in 'Planet of the Spiders', the Doctor was investigating psychic abilities.  This research makes a long delayed return, and in the hands of the manipulative Seventh Doctor, you can be sure that something nasty is on its way.<br />Not likely to be well received by people who want a simple continuation of the TV series, it is however a valid view of what Doctor Who could be like.	2001-04-13

The world houses an utopian society, but with a dark secret.

It certainly doesn't impress me as the utopia it is supposed to be!<br />This book continues to develop the Doctor as a major manipulator storyline, spun-out from some of his activities in the last season of TV stories.  This facet is probably the most interesting of those on display in this book.<br />One of the features of Doctor Who as a TV serial is that forgettable stories come along from time to time.  This book sadly continues that tradition.	2001-04-07

The whole thing hangs together wonderfully - she foreshadows future ideas, she refers back to her previous views, and has plainly thought this project through.<br />And, yes, she addresses the age-old questions - was Watson shot in the shoulder or the leg, why does Mrs. Watson call her husband John &quot;James&quot;, how many times was Watson married and to who, who was Mrs. Turner, which university did Holmes go to, etc.<br />If you are interested in the Holmes canon (as opposed to the stories) you may want to read this one.	2001-04-07

The Doctor and Ace arrive in the English village of Cheldon Boniface... Or so it appears!  Just past the village's outskirts is the surface of the moon.<br />The conclusion of the Timewyrm quartet, this one is perhaps the most interesting of the four (others might argue that 'Timewyrm: Exodus' should hold that distinction).  Inherent to this book is an examination of just how the change of personality that comes about with regeneration is played out in the Doctor's mind.<br />This book turns many of Doctor Who's accepted tenets on their heads while still maintaining them, and may very well be a true revelation to readers who follow the series.<br />Paul Cornell is often spoken of as one of the better writers on Virgin's New Adventures line.

UNIT investigate, first in the form of the Doctor and Jo and later, as the scale of events escalates, the troops are called in.  But what is happening on the surface is nowhere near the full story...<br />This book is not what I would normally expect from a Third Doctor, as it contains a large proportion of violence and a relative small amount of the Doctor (I can't imagine Jon Pertwee would except such a relatively small role!).<br />Set in England in the 70s, with the punk rock revolution occurring, the story is one that is essentially a horror novel with Doctor Who characters involved, but the most pivotal roles go to characters who are introduced in this book.<br />It is a good enough book, quite readable, but the relatively passive roles that the regulars play is not likely to draw the regular Doctor Who reader in if the story doesn't suit.	2001-03-30

Since these two are from different periods, it is plain something is wrong.  They soon pass through barriers to other time periods, which also show a similar degree of wrongness.  What has caused this?  And are they even on Earth?<br />The first new adventure of the Doctor travelling through time and space following the stranded on earth story arc borrows significantly from the past: we have a beginning that looks like the changeover between the first two episodes of the TV series, a world set up not dissimilar to that in 'The War Games', a Doctor without his memories like 'Spearhead from Space', and so forth.  And then it borrows from a movie, the name of which I won't reveal to avoid giving away the plot, but it is something-world, too.<br />So with all these references, how does the book stand up?  Very well, thanks.  Despite them, the novel is very much itself - its tone is nothing like those it recalls, and Jac Rayner is obviously in control.  The story contains a variety of humorous elements, ranging from light to quite black, but the humour doesn't unduly dominate.<br />Perhaps most importantly, the characters of Fitz and Anji receive a lot of focus.  This is Anji's first book as a full-fledged companion, and she wasn't the most sympathetic character in her first appearance.  She ends up far more rounded, and the repeated literary device of her composing imaginary emails to her dead boyfriend helps to deepen both her and her now lost relationship.<br />Fitz has been out of the books for a while, and there are some facts about the character that really haven't been given due attention.  This book helps to reintroduce him as a sort-of lovable loser while bringing these difficult facts to the foreground and having them dealt with - for the moment, anyway.  With the Doctor still nothaving fully recovered his memory, Fitz has many more cards in his hand than either of his travelling companions, but needs to be conscious of what gets out as it may force the Doctor back to the state that his century-long recovery on Earth has been meant to heal.<br />Character driven and with a fun plot, this book is a good read.  It is possibly a little overly backwards referencing for it to be a good start for new readers of the series, but regular readers should enjoy it.	2001-03-30

They start to investigate, and that leads to revelations about the rise of the Nazi party in Britain.  And that leads them to...<br />Terrance Dicks returns to the Doctor Who writing fold with the second novel in the New Adventures range.  And an improvement over the first this certainly is!<br />Now, here in Australia the British obsession with Nazis isn't anywhere near as strong, but it is very understandable.  Knowing what Britain should be like, the Doctor, Ace and the reader start looking for where things have changed in the past to cause the Britain depicted could come to pass.<br />Combining the old with the new (I won't reveal who the returning villain is), Mr. Dicks uses his familiarity with Doctor Who to craft an excellent novel.  At some points during his novelisations of Doctor Who TV serials, Mr. Dicks has given us some very marginal books as well as some good ones.  Given free reign after quite some time, he gives us a cracking good novel.<br />It's probably long out of print, but worth looking for in any case.	2001-03-21

After the BBC ceased producing the Doctor Who TV series, there were some questions as to what would happen to the books published - by and large, they were adaptations of the TV serial.  Due to company takeovers, Virgin now had the licence to Doctor Who books, and had been trying to obtain permission for original adventures. And in 1991, they began...<br />The Doctor finds a message from himself warning about a creature called the Timewyrm, and so he and Ace head off to the origin of the message - Mesopotamia 2700 BC.  There, a spacecraft has crashed and its cybernetic pilot is posing as the goddess Ishtar.  The Doctor and Ace throw in their lot with Gilgamesh to battle this false god from beyond the stars...<br />The new Doctor Who range commenced with a series of linked stories, of which this is the first (the remainder are 'Exodus', 'Apocalypse' and 'Revelation' - the spelling improved as well as the stories!).  Changing the medium of an established product is not the easiest thing to do, and sadly this novel is not a complete success.<br />Characterisation is a bit sparse and the plot derives to a large extent from the epic of Gilgamesh, the earliest known recorded story.  Personally, I don't have too much time for stories which take an established legend and then try to explain it by inserting aliens.  You may as well base your new story on an established one so that any number of your readers won't spot your source but those that do won't have any great possibility to be annoyed by your tampering.<br />John Peel is quite capable of producing good books, but also he can gives us real clangers.  This one falls into the latter category.	2001-03-18

One can only presume that the author couldn't come up with something more appropriate or sought to maximise readership.<br />The book itself is fraught with numerous problems, including an unconvincing portrayal of Sherlock Holmes and an extraordinarily clichéd portrayal of the villain behind the events in the prologue.  This latter made me wonder whether I should read any further.<br />In terms of it being a detective novel, the quality of the deductions is variable.<br />There is also an attempt to build some continuity with other non-Doyle-authored Holmes stories.  While this is appreciated, I must say that the choice of 'The Seven-per-cent Solution' was rather jarring, in that while the feat of breaking Holmes' cocaine addiction by Sigmund Freud is indeed chronicled in that book (as specified here), it also makes it plain that Professor Moriarty was a delusion of Holmes' drug-addled brain, whereas in this book  Moriarty was truly as portrayed by Doyle.  Very clumsy indeed.<br />Don't put this one high on your list of books to read !	2001-03-17

The natives of Blinni-Gaar are TV-addicted zombies, but the TV company has a very hidden agenda.  As they investigate, Channel 400 announces its latest star - the Doctor himself!<br />Treading well-trodden ground ('Vengeance on Varos' is the best-known, but the novel 'Time of Your Life' is also up there), the novel takes a leaf out of the books of both 'The Truman Show' and 'Edtv', in the story it depicts.<br />Having said that, the book is a Doctor Who story, so there are alien menaces to be considered, threats to the lives and welfare of the inhabitants of Blinni-Gaar is a substantial consideration in the Doctor's plans.<br />This is Mike Tucker's first solo novel (his previous have been with co-author Robert Perry), and his style is confident.  I would like to read another solo novel by him as I think this one lacked some of the zing the writing partnership had, but whether it is simply the nature of the story or Mr. Perry's absence remains to be seen.	2001-03-17

But there is something under the water, and another something in orbit around the planet, which will together add up to a potentially world-destroying threat...<br />The third consecutive Seventh Doctor and Ace story from the writing partnership of Robert Perry and Mike Tucker, this is a relatively simple but nevertheless effective traditional Doctor Who story.  In that I mean a story with a human base (in this case, the holiday resort) under threat from a mysterious menace, the nature of which becomes apparent as the story progresses.<br />The world of Coralee is an effectively realised one - humans and dolphins are the dominant species, and the dolphins are better depicted in a book than they would be on TV.  The cooperative nature of the two races in sharing the society seems, to me, quite believable.<br />One of the things that is common in Doctor Who on TV is the buildup of tension until the climax of the story.  With the control of events and the periods of time they happen in, this is fairly easy to accomplish (although somewhat undone by video and DVD technology!).  With the reader's control over pace in reading a book, the same feeling of claustrophobic fear is not so easily achieved in a novel.  For me, this book managed to do that, which is to be commended.<br />And, as one would expect, the portrayal of the Doctor and Ace are very true to their televised versions.<br />Overall, this book has no major defects and gives us a novel that is true to Doctor Who, the TV series, as we know it.	2001-03-11

In truth, the sphere contains a Cyberman...<br />There's something about the Seventh Doctor that seems to require writers gives us stories that feature Cybermen and Nazis - first 'Silver Nemesis' and now this.  However, unlike the twenty-fifth anniversary story, this one works!<br />Flowing quite neatly on from the established relationship between the Doctor and Ace - it is very trusting and mutually reliant.  This places it in distinct contrast with the earlier written New Adventures published by Virgin, which focussed on the Doctor's emerging manipulative nature and the strain it placed on his friendship with Ace.<br />The Cyberman in this story is a return to a classic monster - somewhat spoiled by the ridiculous &quot;allergy&quot; to gold introduced in 'Revenge of the Cybermen', this aspect is not considered in this book and therefore the task of the Doctor and his allies is much more real and dangerous.<br />A good example of how to write a traditional Seventh Doctor story, and a welcome return to a strong portrayal of a classic Who monster.	2001-03-06

The Doctor and Ace come back from a corrupted future to find out how Jack's actions have changed the course of history.  But the truth is more than they had thought...<br />The Doctor and Ace have a very interesting adventure in a classic setting, one which often inspires a great story (like 'Talons of Weng-Chiang', 'Evil of the Daleks' and - stretching over to the Edwardian era - 'Pyramids of Mars').  And Jack the Ripper is such a big figure in history that a Who story featuring him was inevitable ('Talons' was a step in that direction).<br />However, if you are expecting a simple &quot;Doctor vs. Ripper&quot; yarn, you will be surprised.  As you might expect from the title, the story ties in very much with the fictional history of Doctor Who, and in ways that you might find surprising.<br />To say to much would spoil the surprise, so get it and read it before someone spoils it for you...	2001-03-06

But none of them seem to be around, they and others have just vanished, and there have also been deaths amongst the domestic pets.  There is something preying on Perivale...<br />The novelisation of the last regular Doctor Who TV serial, the story is somewhat ironically themed around the concept of the survival of the fittest, and what that can mean to different people.  Bringing Ace back home, especially in light of the two preceding TV serials ('Ghost Light' and 'The Curse of Fenric'), seemed a logical step and the story, focusses on her response to a changed home town in comparison with the Doctor's perspective (if you like, an internal and external view of the problem).<br />While it seems to start off on a small scale, the story grows as the initial oddities prove to be minor manifestations of bigger issues, and the Doctor and Ace find themselves embroiled in a conflict that not only impacts upon Perivale's safety, but places them both under considerable threat - and I'm not just talking mortal peril here, if things go the wrong way they could end up quite different people.<br />A little overshadowed by the &quot;end of an era&quot; feel, this book is however well written and worth adding to your collection.  And you can take heart in the truth of its name: despite cancellation as a TV serial by the BBC, Doctor Who continues going strong to this day.

And, like in its predecessor there are tales of a ghostly hound out on the moors, this time accompanying an equally ghostly carriage.<br />This series are always well worth a read.  Laurie King brings carries off three significant tricks, each alone being worth the price of admission: characterisation of her leads, local and contemporary colour, and a great plot.<br />In terms of the first, both Holmes and Russell are depicted as somewhat prickly characters, unwilling to suffer fools gladly, and each with their own areas of interest and expertise.  Russell works well by herself, but sparks of all kinds fly when her husband is around (being narrated by Russell, we never see Holmes by himself).  In this book, the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould also features strongly, and occasionally view with the leads for our attention.  Given he is virtually bedridden, this is no small feat.<br />The depiction of different kinds of characters and their environments helps bring the story to life.  Between those who live on the moor and those who live in the village, lords of the manor and their servants and so forth, we have no opportunity to mistake where and when the book is set.  Two scenes which didn't really advance the plot but were wonderful are Russell's meeting with the local witch (as the moor dwellers call her), Elizabeth Chase, and a scene set in the pub where the locals spend the evening singing to entertain themselves - with its attendant rivalry between those who live in the village and those who live on the moor.<br />Russell's growing understanding of the moor as a place and a presence in the life of its inhabitants also works very well.<br />And lastly the plot: it's a cracker!  I'm not going to give anything more away, but the final outcome was not what I had expected at the beginning of the book.<br />In summary: what are you waiting for?	2001-03-03

But the base is also the target of a Russian Special Missions brigade, intent on raiding their allies, and it contains some odd goings on.  Ace will confront a large personal issue, and something else lurks under the surface of the ocean...<br />Ian Briggs produced a complicated but involving script, where a large number of elements were carefully balanced against each other to challenge both the Doctor and the viewer in working out exactly what was going on.  In adapting it into this book, he takes the opportunity to present some of the information in more detail and in ways that would never have worked on TV.<br />As part of Doctor Who's twenty-sixth season, the Doctor takes a more manipulative role than that which many viewers of previous years would have expected, and in this story it goes some way to causing him real problems.  The consequent shift of narrative focus to Ace allows her to become a fuller and more involved character.  And yes, there is a real personal ghost which is confronted by her during this book.<br />This story is satisfying in both formats (video and book), and stands apart sufficiently from the shows own continuity (without contradicting it!) that it could be enjoyed by fans and casual readers alike.	2001-03-03

As events escalate, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart is called back from retirement as figures from Arthurian legends walk the fields of England.<br />Marc Platt adapts Ben Aaronovitch's script into this novel, and the story is an odd patchwork.  The extent to which it works is probably a matter of personal opinion.  For me, it is OK but could have been better.<br />One of the strengths is the return of the Brigadier, whose relationship with the Doctor is well emphasised - their friendship is plain and obviously very strong.  There is also one of the Brig's best scenes in the show's history.<br />Not so well fitting are the Arthurian elements - while interesting enough, the assertion that a future incarnation of the Doctor will be known as Merlin is a little hard to take, and the attempts to insert technologically-based &quot;magic&quot; is quite poor.<br />There are also a large number of supporting characters, who do not seem to play a useful role.<br />An interesting experiment, treading some familiar ground (technology as magic has been covered in 'The Daemons', 'The Time Monster', 'Pyramids of Mars', etc. with varying degrees of success), which doesn't quite make if for me.	2001-03-02

The house is occupied by a group of characters who make the Addams' Family.  And then there's what's in the cellar...<br />'Ghost Light' was a great TV serial, possibly only marred by the density of the information making it a little hard to follow.  In adapting his story to this novel, Marc Platt is able to clarify it, if only by the reader having far more control over how quickly events happen.<br />Set well in the Victorian era, the story is based around the idea of evolution and informed by the Victorian debate on Darwin's theories.  Focussing in on Ace, the story assists in making the Doctor once more a mysterious element in the story.	2001-03-02

The main problem is that not very much happens, and we keep getting hinted at that there is more than meets the eye.<br />From my reading, scratching the surface just reveals even more surface.

It also has a nod to Franz Kafka - like Josef K in 'The Trial', all the inhabitants of the planet have a single letter as their surnames.<br />Containing several obvious swipes at the British Government under Margaret Thatcher, although one would hesitate to try to name who the Kandy Man represents!  The Kandy Man is the chief executioner of Terra Alpha, and specialises in death by confectionery.<br />A little bit odd, a little bit traditional, a little bit over-sweet.  You might like it, but it may also be a little bit rich for some tastes.	2001-02-27

Also on Iceworld is a young girl called Ace, who will play an important role in the Doctor's life.  And then there are some other people on Iceworld, and not very nice either.  And the dragon...<br />A substantial turning point in the Seventh Doctor's life, this story has its good and bad points.  Not the least one being the Doctor's very odd decision to hang himself off a cliff by his umbrella.  On a more positive note, Glitz's return is excellent and the villain of the piece, Kane, had a lot of potential.<br />Ian Briggs writes the book in a way that adds to the TV serial, with insights into the characters.  But, overall, it is a fairly shallow story, so read it quickly and don't think about the finer details.	2001-02-26

He is setting a trap for the Daleks - but why are there more than one group of Daleks on 1960s Earth?<br />A great new start to the Seventh Doctor's second season sees the Doctor becoming far more complex and assured, and uses the English army and its scientific advisers to get to what he wants.  But the two Dalek factions are rather more than he bargained for, and there are several more complicated factors in the story.<br />Ben Aaronovitch wrote this fabulous story for TV, and betters it with the novelisation.  He expands considerably on the original story, establishing some elements that survived considerably beyond the book, and making a very readable addition to the Doctor Who range of books.<br />This is also the best Dalek story for a long time, and should be appreciated.  Certainly worth you going out of your way to find!	2001-02-26

Off they go, but there is a stowaway with pursuers on her tail, and the trip to the Shangri-La Holiday Camp turns out to be considerably more than anyone bargained for...<br />At the time I'm writing this review, 'Delta' is the single Seventh Doctor story not released on video (due to happen real soon!).  It is also the only Seventh Doctor story I haven't seen, so this book is the only way I've experienced this story.<br />And a little odd it is too - the enforced bonhomie of the holiday camp, the coldness of the Bannermen, American secret service agents, aliens from all over the universe and a strange old beekeeper all add up to a story which could have been better, but certainly could have been worse!<br />Malcolm Kohll's writing style is pretty straightforward, and the story is not terribly challenging, so it won't necessarily be the most memorable leave that you'll ever have.	2001-02-26

But when they arrive, the place is very run down and populated with people who have broken down in tribes - the Caretakers, the Rezzies, and a variety of all-girl Kang tribes.  But there is something else in the building, controlling matters behind the scenes...<br />'Paradise Towers' is perhaps the first taste of what a large proportion of the TV Seventh Doctor serials would be like - familiar in some ways, but new in others.  Adapted to a novel by scriptwriter Stephen Wyatt, it makes an interesting read.<br />If you have watched the TV serial, you'll know what the story is about.  However, in the novel, Mr. Wyatt has the opportunity to present more background information.  So, if you liked the TV serial, you'll probably like the book, and the reverse is true.<br />If you haven't watched the TV serial, you will get a story which is on a fairly small and claustrophobic scale, with interesting ideas presented in sometimes inappropriate ways.  Its quite well written, but smacks of a need to create a new style of Doctor Who.	2001-02-25

The TARDIS is carrying the Doctor and Mel through the vortex, when it is suddenly drawn off course, and the Doctor is thrown to the floor, regenerating.  The TARDIS lands on the planet Lakertya, and the Rani enters the TARDIS, having her alien allies take the Doctor back to her base.  What is her plan?<br />Written by Pip and Jane Baker in both formats, it features the return of a renegade Time Lord, the Rani, and introduces her new race of allies, the Tetraps.  Unlike her original appearance ('The Mark of the Rani'), she has a big plan and she'll do whatever she needs to to achieve it.  The Rani is always untroubled by ordinary morals.<br />Into this plan, insert a Doctor disoriented by his regeneration, a race of pleasure-seekers, and a companion with more enthusiasm than sense, and you have a volatile mix.<br />Having said that, the story is pretty straightforward and in the traditional Doctor Who vein, probably a politic move given the casting upheaval that it was somewhat overshadowed as a TV serial by the ousting of Colin Baker from the title role and the introduction of Sylvester McCoy, the novel benefits from some distance from this highly questionable decision by the BBC (well, the ousting of Colin - Sylv plays a great Doctor!).  Having said that, the actual joy of watching Kate O'Mara playing the Rani playing Mel is actually a real treat - so you may want to watch the video for that reason alone.<br />The Bakers also have an annoying habit of scrambling letters to create words rather than just making it up.  The Rani is after loyhargil (otherwise &quot;holy grail&quot; - which is no hint at the true nature), and the Tetraps' cries at the end need only be read backwards top reveal what they are really after...	2001-02-25

Edwin is the elder brother of the infamous John Wilkes Booth, and it is his story that Holmes must investigate to resolve the mystery of the assassination attempts on his cousin's life.<br />Covering some of the same ground as Barrie Roberts' 'Sherlock Holmes and the Royal Flush', I ended up reading these two book in a fairly close period of time.  This allows me to compare how the two authors put facts from John Wilkes Booth's life and death into their books.  The problem is - it would be a dead giveaway on their plotlines to do so!  Suffice to say, 'The Surrogate Assassin' takes the issues in a more active and head-on way.<br />I found Christopher Leppek's writing style quite readable, and his portrayal of Holmes and Watson well within my view of how the characters should be written.  However, I did find some of the facts a little contradictory with the writings of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Holmes' creator.  For instance, he makes casual reference to Mycroft Holmes, who Watson would not even know of for several years to come!  Mind you, Doyle was pretty careless about such things as well (for instance, Moriarty's appearance in 'The Valley of Fear') so one shouldn't be too harsh.	2001-02-25

The Doctor is not familiar with the primitive Earth computer language involved, and so a local is needed.  Imagine his horror when that local turns out to be the woman he is trying to avoid: Mel Bush, his future companion...<br />In the wake of 'The Trial of the Time Lord', we have a Doctor who knows that he has the potentials to become the antithesis of what he believes in.  During his trial, he became aware that he would one day have Mel as a companion, and sees this as a step down the path towards becoming the Valeyard.<br />This story is the real introductory story for Mel, who must prove herself as worthy in ways that other companion have never had to.  One of the least popular of the Doctor's companions in her TV appearances, Gary Russell takes on the difficult task of proving Mel worthy to both the Doctor and the readers.  I guess the extent to which he succeeds is a matter of opinion: this book certainly makes Mel a less one-dimensional character than she appeared on TV.<br />As well as coping with that continuity issue, though, Mr. Russell might have been wiser to have set the whole thing up with an enemy who is mining the Doctor's past adventures on Earth for weapons.  Recognising and appreciating all the threats that arise later in the book really requires a bunch of knowledge of the Doctor's earlier adventures.	2001-02-24

The Doctor is travelling in the TARDIS with his companion Frobisher (a shape-changing Whifferdill who normally chooses to look like a penguin) when the TARDIS is invaded by a couple of assassins intent on the Time Lord's death.  Tracing the assassins' trail to the Gamma Delphinus system, where they become involved in complex political and financial intrigue, as well as a couple of rogues of the Doctor's acquaintance: Sabalom Glitz and Dibber.  But the identity of the person behind the whole thing is a large surprise...<br />This is the first non-comic strip appearance of Frobisher who, unfortunately, doesn't come across terribly well here.  In the comic strips or Big Finish's audio adventure with the Whifferdill, the wonderful 'The Holy Terror', the visual or voice content help make Frobisher more than he is here.<br />The return of Glitz and Dibber is welcome, as they were a great double act in 'The Mysterious Planet', but writer David McIntee makes one very foolish decision in this book, which I shan't relate as it is a significant event in the story.  Glitz certainly works better when he has a more-or-less reliable henchman with him.<br />The story is OK, expanding some of what we know about a couple of the alien races introduced in the books (the Doctor's would-be assassins are a Tzun and a Veltrochni), and featuring the Ogrons as general muscle, but for my money I would have rather had something that seems less of a runaround than this.<br />A good try, but not a successful one.	2001-02-24

But what Grant doesn't remember (he was very young when he was sent away) is that the Cybermen are using Agora as a farm - they call back every few year to capture and convert humans to Cybermen.  And here they come now...<br />This book spotlights Grant quite considerably, given that the Doctor is imprisoned for a good portion of it.  As the new companion, we get to find out a lot of Grant's background, as does he.  But the circumstances under which he learns things are not the best.  While Grant goes through the emotional wringer, the Doctor gets the physical version as the Overseers and the Cybermen masters try some things out on him...<br />Fairly relentless in its grimness, the book certainly isn't the easiest to read.  However, I recommend you persevere as it is worth your while - the eventual success of both the Doctor and Grant in the face of considerable adversity shows true triumph.	2001-02-23

There is an overarching storyline that continues and develops between the four and the whole makes more sense together.<br />This story had an odd origin: it was to be written by Robert Holmes, who wrote the first half before falling ill.  Tragically, he died shortly thereafter.  The second half was then taken up by Doctor Who's then script editor Eric Saward, but tensions between the production team led to Saward's resignation and withdrawal of hios script.  So enter Pip and Jane Baker, who also novelise this story, who get to finalise the story.<br />Featuring both new companion Mel and Sabalom Glitz (who first appeared in 'The Mysterious Planet'), the story is a little bit schizo.  The two halves don't necessarily meld well into a whole, the second half being rather less impressive than the first, but having the book written by the same team (rather than two different sets of writers) results in it being more complete in presentation than the serial.<br />The big thing about this book is that it reveals all the hidden bits within the earlier three, some of which contradicts what we saw earlier.  The true version, rather than the doctored version.  And there are several surprises, the full nature of which you should read the book to find out.	2001-02-22

There is an overarching storyline that continues and develops the four and the whole makes more sense together.<br />The first two parts represent the prosecution's case against the Doctor.  Now, he presents his defence with an adventure from his own future - his defence being that he improves.  In this adventure, modelled on the tried-and-true 'Murder on the Orient Express' style, is fairly straightforward.  The bad news is that the story is quite muddies by the trial sequence: it is regularly intrusive and the questions about the veracity of the story are very much at the forefront.<br />In this story we meet Mel, the Doctor's new companion who he has yet to meet.  Mel is a computer programmer and a fitness fanatic, and is sadly portrayed in a fairly one-dimensional way - a trait that characterised Mel during the vast majority of her TV serials.  I have been pleased that she has become a better developed character in the original novels and her one Big Finish audio - 'Fires of Vulcan'.<br />I wasn't too happy with the introduction of an &quot;old friend&quot; of the Doctor, who we have never seen before.  While this is fine, I don't think it actually added anything to then story.<br />A problem with this book is that the final understanding of what happens doesn't come until you read 'The Ultimate Foe', which is a rather sad thing.	2001-02-22

There is an overarching storyline that continues and develops between the four and the whole makes more sense together.<br />The idea is simple: the Doctor is put on trial by his own people for the crime of interference.  The first three parts are individual stories presented as evidence, with the overarching storyline finalised in the fourth part.<br />This one is a good start - the interaction between the trial and the evidence is fairly minimal, so the traditional-style adventure of the Doctor and Peri can be enjoyed.  The story was originally written by Robert Holmes, one of Doctor Who's best scripters, and is in fact his last full story.  It introduces Sabalom Glitz, an intergalactic purveyor of dodgy goods, and has a quite mysterious planet - it seems like Earth, but its in the wrong position.  Exactly what is the truth is revealed in part in this book - more is to come later...<br />This book only scratches the surface of the real reasons behind the Doctor's trial - and there is more to it than initially meets the eye.  And there is a big question - where is Peri?  Why isn't she still with the Doctor?  All the answers are still to come...	2001-02-21

There is an overarching storyline that continues and develops the four and the whole makes more sense together.<br />The first part told a tale of the Doctor's past; this time, we get to see the adventure in which the Doctor was involved when he was taken out of his timestream to be put on trial.  This story, featuring the return of the popular Sil from 'Vengeance on Varos', is more a typical Sixth Doctor story - a tale of body horror, extreme personalities  and the Doctor in conflict with his companion.  And it answers the question of exactly why Peri isn't at the Doctor's trial... (Or does it?)<br />In this segment, the interaction between the trial storyline and the main storyline (which is being presented as evidence) becomes stronger.  While this helps to draw the overall story together, it does detract a it from the individual segment.<br />Philip Martin writes good and original stories (the under-developed 'Mission to Magnus' aside), and this one is probably a little poorly served by the overarching trial story.  Some of the elements are not resolved until the end of the trial, and re-reading this book may assist you in understanding the whole.	2001-02-21

During the 1985 hiatus of Doctor Who, there was one small spark of hope: a six part radio play featuring the Doctor and Peri.  A spark of hope, that is, until you get to read this awful book.<br />The radio serial was never broadcast here in Australia, so this book is the first time I got to experience it (I have later on heard it).  Written for both radio and this book by the contemporary Doctor Who script Editor, Eric Saward, I am yet again struck by the man's complete failure to grasp the fundamentals of what Doctor Who is about.<br />The story starts with the Doctor waking up with a hangover, a decidedly unDoctorish thing to do, and continues with very poor understanding of the show.  The notional villain, Slarn, never actually meets either the Doctor or Peri and seems to be the kind of character that would feature in some low-grade British comedy.<br />In fact the whole thing is just plain silly and not a terribly good use of s well-loved fictional character.

I was forgetting this, the very wonderful League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.<br />The idea is simple: during the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, tales of heroic fiction were popular.  In this series, characters from those tales are brought together for a shared adventure.  In this volume, you can see Miss Mina Murray (from Bram Stoker's 'Dracula') leading a group consisting of Captain Nemo (&quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, Jules Verne), Allan Quartermain (&quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot; and lots of others, H. Rider Haggard), Dr. Hawley Griffin (&quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, H.G. Wells) and Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde (&quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, Robert Louis Stevenson).<br />These characters are such classics that even the most casual of readers will have heard of some of them, and if you are interested in the fiction of that period, it may well be a wonderful treat.  Asd well as these characters, the book is liberally peppered with characters from various Victorian sources, up to and including pornography!  Mr. Moore has certainly researched this one closely before applying his wonderful imagination.<br />Having said that, the art by Kevin O'Neill is certainly not completely in character with the art illustrating stories of the period, but Mr. O'Neill has toned down the style he often uses to better suit the content.<br />But wait, there's more: the volume concludes with a text story of Allan Quartermain, which features him in conjunction with Randolph Carter, John Carter and the Time Traveller (created by H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Rice Burroughs and H.G. Wells respectively) which ties in, at least in part, with the main story.<br />I'd like to reveal the villains of the piece, but that would be telling given that the revelation is part of the story's plot!  Good choices, though.  And a very enjoyable read.	2001-02-18

Unfortunately, their visit coincides with that of the Dwarf Mordant, a member of a manipulative alien race who delight in causing harm to others.  And Mordant wants a Time Lord there for his own reasons...<br />This story is actually quite silly.  It is full of clich&eacute;d behaviour and situations, and people seem to respond to things in odd ways that don't serve any kind of character development but do progress the plot, such as it is.<br />While I don't support the BBC's decision to skip a year of Doctor Who production, I am however happy that this one didn't get made.<br />Really only suitable to say that you have every Doctor Who book.	2001-02-17

Stranded on Earth in the late nineteenth century without his TARDIS or memory after the events of 'The Ancestor Cell', we find the Doctor caught up in events that relate to the fate of the village of Middletown, whose major source of employment (a mine) has just closed down.<br />Enter the mysterious Roger Nepath, traveller and collector of artefacts which relate to the topic of fire, and his plan to reopen the mine.<br />As is normal with the Doctor, he turns up and all hell breaks loose, although that looks like more than a turn of phrase in this book.  The cast of characters in this book are quite well-defined, although some of them undergo a transformation in fairly short order.<br />The actual nature of the menace is kept concealed for much of the book, although from the title, the striking cover, and the number of times early chapters end with the phrase &quot;And the burning.&quot;, you're on safe ground betting that it has something to do with fire.  While the revelation is not something new in Doctor Who, it should take quite a few people by surprise.<br />My one complaint is that Justin Richards, who is he BBC's consultant on its range of Doctor Who books, didn't really give me a strong impression that the Doctor has lost his memory.  There are a couple of things he should have recognised, but other than being told he has no memory a few times I didn't really get that impression.<br />Not the most auspicious start for a new story arc.  A book which spent more time on the changes in the Doctor's circumstances would have been better, with this perhaps the second.  Still, it's worth seeing where this is taking us.	2001-02-17

They are quickly drawn into the machinations of the Toymaker, an old foe and a very bored creature from another universe who amuses himself by playing games with them - and cheating.  And he wants revenge on the Doctor...<br />'Nightmare Fair' suffers from what I'm tempted to call Sixth Doctoritus - the story heads off in bizarre and gruesome directions where others are available and would have been preferable.  Williams has limited experience as a novelist, but does write in a readable way.<br />I suspect that, had this story been made into a TV serial as intended, it would have been suitably enhanced by the acting skills of the cast.

For me, I'm pulling odd faces about 'Heart of TARDIS'.<br />Dave Stone opts to present us with a double Doctor story featuring the second and fourth incarnations - it is set (or so it tells us) between 'The Tomb of the Cybermen' and 'The Abominable Snowmen' on the one hand, and 'The Stones of Blood' and 'The Androids of Tara' on the other.  Or so we are told - there is no real reason why it should be set between those stories.  In particular, the fourth Doctor is doing this story halfway through the Key to Time season, although there is very little in the story that would make you think so.  I don't comprehend why the quest for the Key is put aside for this story.<br />To my mind, all the characters are generally not particularly in character, and if we weren't told we were  that we were reading about the first incarnation of Romana, you'd never know.<br />The storyline is perhaps a little overly complex, and we get to see the same things over and over again.<br />If this rich read is to your taste, you might want to read it several time to understand how it fits together.  For me, I don't think a second reading will happen for a while!	2001-02-17

Several stories were planned and in the writing stage when this edict came down.  Three of these stories were novelised by their scripters - this one, featuring the return Sil and the Ice Warriors, was written by Sil creator Philip Martin.<br />The TARDIS pulled off course by Anzor, another Time Lord who bullied him while they were both at school.  The Doctor responds by becoming a cringing coward, but they eventually escape to the planet Magnus Epsilon.  There are plots within plots as the natives of the planet work with Anzor, but there is a mysterious series of happenings which reveal the presence of the Ice Warriors...<br />Not a very good example of Philip Martin's writing skills (both the earlier 'Vengeance on Varos' and later 'Mindwarp' are considerably better), its main problem is that it seems to largely be two stories stuck together - initially, the Doctor and Peri are facing Anzor and, just when he is defeated, up turn the Ice Warriors.<br />Sil's role is also comparatively small, and really misses Nabil Shaban's wonderful screen presence.  The Ice Warriors are very bland; really, they could be any alien race...  And I really hated the idea of a Time Lord school bully!<br />The end result is a very light read with the recurring opponents very poorly served.	2001-02-17

Essentially, following a particularly unpleasant finish to an adventure (never written, just referred to in this book), Mel decides to leave the Doctor and asks to be dropped off on Earth.  The Doctor complies, but both are drawn into events arising from the TV serial 'The Time Monster' (which was not very good!).<br />The book is weighed down with Doctor Who continuity and a seemingly desperate desire to straighten out the cosmology of the series.  It also features several references to non-Who (Star Trek, comics, etc.) matters.  I'm sure I missed several of the references.<br />However, Mr. Hinton wears one influence very plainly on his sleeve - Garth Ennis' great comic series 'Preacher'.  It is plain from the beginning how much Mr. Hinton enjoys this comic (which I'd recommend to most, although some with strong Christian beliefs may find some of it difficult).  Unfortunately, Mr. Ennis did it a whole lot better (twice!), and I don't it works for me in this book.<br />That said, my main problem is that (in my opinion) Doctor Who works much better on a smaller scale than this.  I enjoyed Mr. Hinton's last novel ('Millennial Rites') much more than this, even though it was more cosmic than the usual Doctor Who fare, probably because it didn't go as far as this one.  Do write again, Mr. Hinton, but on a smaller scale!<br />I suspect this one is really for the die-hard Doctor Who reader, with the very high number of continuity references making it either semi-intelligible or possibly boring to casual readers.	2001-02-16

The Doctor has had it with Peri - her truculence and unwillingness to join in his unfocussed joi de vivre means that he decides to drop her off back on Earth.  But on the way they run into a Kontron Tunnel, and so they investigate.  One end is Earth, 1179 AD and the other on the planet Karfel, a planet with which the Doctor is familiar.  But the situation on Karfel is rather more complicated than they might have expected...<br />'Timelash' is, put simply, a bit of a mess.  The Doctor and Peri don't actually become fully involved in the story until about half-way through, and the villain of the piece is pretty clichéd, including deciding to make Peri his mate.  The political situation on Karfel could have been quite interesting, but sadly its carboard cut-out intrigue.<br />The advantage of the novel over the TV serial is that you are spared both the dreadful sets and the even more dreadful overacting of Paul Darrow in the role of Tekker.<br />Not one to seek out actively.	2001-02-16

What will be the greatest threat to the Doctor, Steve and Dodo - the fast approach Mongol horde, the dark angel below the city, or the palace intrigues?<br />It has been quite a while since a First Doctor novel was published, and so 'Bunker Soldiers' is quite welcome.  Martin Day projects the atmosphere of the Hartnell era - things happen a slow pace and a great feeling in doomed inevitability hangs over the book.<br />The book is written from two perspectives: a third person for a large portion, but interspersed with Steven Taylor as the narrator.  This helps bring Steven's character to life and, with actor Peter Purves narrating the lost Hartnell stories on CD, it is easy to imagine him doing so.<br />The main problem is Dodo - she really doesn't have much to do in this book.  However, there is an excellent bit for Dodo quite late in the book when it becomes possible that her actions may later inspire a great tragedy, which causes Dodo a great degree of distress.<br />Hopefully it won't be so long until the next First Doctor novel arrives.	2001-02-16

The Doctor has been on Earth with no memory of his past for over a century.  He has an appointment to meet Fitz in a bar called St. Louis'.  He hopes to learn who he is from this man he doesn't remember.  But for Fitz, only a few days have passed, and when he hears about a man with two hearts being killed in Brussels, he heads off to investigate...<br />'Escape Velocity' is the final story in the &quot;trapped on Earth&quot; story arc, and features the welcome return of Fitz Kriener.  Fitz's concerns about the Doctor bring them both into the plots of a small group of aliens, trapped on Earth and trying to esacpe, and the attempts by two of Earth's richest men to become the first independently-funded men in space.<br />It is also the story of Anji Kapoor and Dave Young, a couple who are having troubles - and they haven't seen nothing before this story...<br />As a conclusion to a story arc, it is fairly satisfying (although I was somewhat disappointed that the Doctor made no mention of Miranda - anyone would think 'Father Time' never happened!), but it is perhaps more successful as the re-launch of the series into its travels through time and space.  In doing so, it evokes the very first Doctor Who TV serial, 'An Unearthly Child', quite successfully by way of returning the series to its roots without necessarily ignoring over 35 years of stories in between.<br />This is apparently Colin Brake's first novel, although he is a writer of TV scripts, and he appears to have mastered the art of novel writing very well.  Hopefully we'll be seeing more books form his pen in the future.	2001-02-16

As king for elegance, the Doctor suggests England at the end of the 19th century.  And it is at the end of the 19th century they arrive, but not in England.  Instead, they arrive in South Africa, at the beginning of the Boer War, and soon find themselves in the company of a war correspondent by the name of Winston Churchill...<br />This book introduces the Players, a group of shadowy beings who play games by manipulating the fates of people and countries.  Terrance Dicks reuses them in his Eighth Doctor novel, 'Endgame', but this is their first appearance and hence sets the tone for the latter novel.<br />It also sets a pattern followed by the later 'Divided Loyalties', which is to say the book has three parts, the first and last featuring one incarnation of the Doctor (here, the Sixth) and the middle an earlier one (in this case, the Second).  This is a fairly satisfying arrangement, as we get to see more than one incarnation without having to go through all the hoopla of having two different incarnations meet.<br />It also re-uses some supporting characters from the last Second Doctor serail, 'The War Games'.  While the return of Lieutenant Carstairs and Lady Jennifer is no doubt a bonus for Who fans, I don't believe casual readers would find this in anyway a problem.  And then there's Tom Dekker, from 'Blood Harvest', a Seventh Doctor novel.  The Sixth Doctor's era seemed particularly concerned with the shows continuity, but I'm pleased to say this book uses continuity as it should: as a reward to those who follow the series without isolating casual readers.<br />I am sometimes critical of Terrance Dicks writing, but not with this book: it seems like he had had a break from writing Who and leapt back into it with relish.<br />On all counts, a worthy addition to the series.	2001-02-16

The Second Doctor and Jamie are sent on a mission to investigate time travel experiments on Station J7, where the Doctor's old friend Dastari is in charge.  During their investigations, the base is attacked by Sontarans and the Doctor is captured, leaving Jamie behind.  Sometime later, the Doctor returns to the base, but this time in his sixth incarnation with Peri in tow.  He is looking into a strange illness that has swept over him, and finds eveidence that his earlier sef maay be dead...<br />One of the best stories from the Sixth Doxtor's era, it is sadly filled with inaccuracies about the second incarnation - to put it bluntly, wrong on almost every count!  The novelisation suffers from the absence of the acting skills of Pat Troughton and Frazer Hines, who breathe real and substantial life into their roles once more, so this leaves those familiar with the Doctor's history somewhat puzzled as to exactly who this earlier Doctor is.  (In fact, this stroy has led to first a theory and now a fact that the Second Doctor had some travels between his sentence at the end of 'The War Games' and his exile in his third incarnation...)<br />This story being set in the era of the Sixth Doctor, it is a bit overly concerned with some gruesome matters, in this case cannibalism.  While the wide-ranging dietary habits of the Androgums are played as a somewhat humorous matter, the desire of  Shockeye to catch and eat both Jamie and Peri are a little beyond the norm of threats to companions.<br />The plotting at cross-purposes of the Sontarans, Dastari and Chessene does breathe some life into the villains of the piece - so often, the bad guys all seem to be of the one mind, so it is good to see some differentiation in plans and methods as is shown here.<br />Overall, a worthwhile book, but a bit nastier than the average Who fare.	2001-02-16

The BBC, in the days before home video, decided that some of its programs were no longer required in its archives. In a somewhat unsystematic purging, many classics were consigned to the flames, including several Doctor Who stories. Fortunately, some fans of the series had made their own audio recordings, and these (following a thorough re-mastering by the BBC) are being released.<br />'The Web of Fear' is one of these releases. This story is very important in Doctor Who's long history - it points the way forward to a major change in format. At the beginning of the series, the Doctor's companions included two teachers (Ian and Barbara). No story took place on contemporary Earth as one of the plot threads was the endeavours of these two teachers to return to their own time and place. Even after they returned home, this aversion to contemporary Earth continued. The first story fully set on contemporary Earth was 'The War Machines', and 'The Web of Fear' was the second.<br />Following on from the popularity of the Yeti in 'The Abominable Snowmen' (another lost story, and sadly not also available as a CD soundtrack), the Doctor, Jamie and Victoria again encounter the Yeti - this time in the contemporary London Underground. This story introduces Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart, who afterwards is promoted to Brigadier and placed in charge of the British section of the United Nations Taskforce. One of the most popular of Doctor Who's supporting cast.<br />The story is strong, with an underlying mystery - who is the agent of the Great Intelligence who is controlling things? There is a sizable cast with lots of suspects. As the story progresses, the web closes in and the cast members are thinned out. Tension would have been quite high for the viewers experiencing this story, one episode at a time over six weeks. It is still palpable in this story, even if you were to listen to all two and a half hours in one sitting.<br />Of course, we are deprived of the visuals and linking narrative read by Frazer Hines (who plays Jamie in the story) can only go some way towards bridging these gaps. For me, the season in which 'The Web of Fear' appeared is the first I can remember watching Doctor Who as a child. My memory could supply a limited amount of imagery to accompany the sounds, but I don't believe this is necessary.<br />'The Web of Fear' is one of the best stories of Patrick Troughton's era playing the Doctor, and it is a good story for anyone interested in the show. For the fans, the bonus is that the story is a precursor to the UNIT stories, which were to form the backbone of the series a couple of years after this story was broadcast. <br />Highly recommended. OK BBC, where's 'The Abominable Snowmen'?	2001-02-16

This novel looks at the consequences of that off the cuff suggestion.<br />Strange dreams of black tidal waves threaten the Doctor's mind, when he suddenly realises that they remind him of the anti-matter gateway he encountered on Zeta Minor.  He sets course for the Morestran Empire, and arrives about 1000 years after he last encountered them.  He has been incorporated into their religion as the mysterious figure known as 'il Dottore', who is seen as a savior of the Morestran Empire.  But there is something rotten in the Morestran Empire, and the Sorensen Project seems to be at it's heart...<br />Nyssa and Tegan end up playing more active roles than the Doctor for great chunks of this novel, which is not a bad thing.  I am, however, getting a little tired of Nyssa being &quot;transformed&quot; in novels - to a vampire in 'Goth Opera', mummified as part of her transformation to be a vessel for Nephthys in 'Sands of Time', and infected with anti-matter here.  Luckily, she is faring better in the Big Finish audio stories she has featured in.<br />While the Morestran Empire's culture is interesting enough and the characters are well-portrayed, I found that the book dragged a bit and could have done with a rewrite to make it shorter.  The fact that I have never liked 'Planet of Evil' probably didn't help this sequel for me.	2001-02-16

Watson	Books	4	1	1	N	N	This dish is served cold	The second Sherlock Holmes book from the pen of Larry Millet, this one is an improvement on the first - which was quite good in any case.<br />At the end of 'Sherlock Holmes and the Red Demon', Watson makes reference to this case.  Holmes and Watson are again summoned to St. Pauls in Minnesota to investigate the fact that the son of a friend of Holmes' American patron has gone missing.  Shortly after Holmes' arrival, he discover gruesome proof that the missing man was murdered.<br />What distinguishes this book from its predecessor is that there is no spectre of an impending disaster - a great fire that is hinted at from the beginning of the earlier book - we instead have no idea exactly what the climax of the story is likely to be.  The cast of characters is probably stronger, and in particular the addition of St. Pauls-based former policeman, bar owner and sometime detective Shad Rafferty who is great - a hint at the end of this book suggests that Rafferty will be back in Millet's third book 'Sherlock Holmes and the Runestone Mystery'.<br />Possibly a little slow, it is however in line with the original Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and the depictions of Holmes and Watson is pleasingly in line with their originals - a task that sometimes proves elusive to other writers.	2001-02-16

I can't really say why, so I suspect I have just never got around to it.  This 350-odd page volume is the first of several, apparently in excess of 2000 pages all up, so I'd assume there will be about 7 volumes.<br />Set in Neo-Tokyo post-World War III (which started in 1992 - I mean, I know I was busy but I would have thought I'd have noticed!), the first volume revolves around a motor cycle gang of 17 year olds in a &quot;youth vocational training school&quot; who become entangled with the conflict between a government project involving people with psychic powers and a guerilla force that opposes them.  And Akira?  Who knows for certain... Various people use the word with a sense of something big that is anticipated, but the reader doesn't know exactly what.<br />While I find (as is often the case) some of the behavior of characters in manga to occasionally border on the ridiculous (I don't have much time for people behaving oddly in order to raise a laugh with the reader), the story progresses quite reasonably and the art is generally quite good, although the manga-style of overly cartooning expressions can be annoying if you aren't expecting it.<br />As to getting the whole series...  Not 100% sure, but certainly there is enough interest in this one to guarantee I'll be getting the second volume at the very least.	2001-02-16

With odds of  several billions to one against, we all know that there is a ship on a collision course.<br />And so begins one of the more noteworthy Doctor Who stories of the show's twentieth season: a story that introduces a new companion (Turlough), brings back the Brigadier, relies on time travel and has several surprises in store.<br />And several problems, too.  The original story was written to return one of the Doctor's first companions, Ian Chesterton, in a one-off reappearance, but when William Russell was unavailable they just slotted the Brigadier in instead without substantially rewriting the story.  And so the story fits poorly with previously established Doctor Who chronology, and we have the unlikely situation of the Brigadier teaching maths at a boys' school.<br />So, the story's saving grace is that it is a good story.  Had it been less well written, it would have fallen flat on its face.<br />This book is also the first part of a trilogy of stories, followed on from by 'Terminus' and 'Enlightenment'.	2001-02-11

The whole is highly unstable.  The Doctor opts to stay to help un-merge the ships.  However, while this is a complex matter, things are far more complex: someone is smuggling drugs, and strange creatures are seen in the unstable areas where the ships overlap...<br />One of the better stories of Doctor Who's season seventeen (which, sadly, isn't saying much), the story is quite good and is largely let down on video by some of the acting.

And there not one but two renegade Time Lords are laying down their plans...<br />This story is probably best remembered for introducing the Rani, a renegade Time Lord of the female gender (I really don't like to call her a Time Lady because she certainly isn't a lady!).  Played with great panache on TV by Kate O'Mara, here in the novelisation by script writers Pip and Jane Baker she comes across very cold - perhaps colder than on TV.  While I generally like the Rani, I do have a problem with the fact that the Bakers can't seem to show us that she is a genius - they have to have people tell us she is again and again and again...<br />Also on Earth, and the reason for the TARDIS being knocked off course, is the Master.  He draws the Rani into his plans for revenge on the Doctor and Peri, using her genius (about which he waxes lyrical on several occasions) by hijacking some of her inventions.<br />The story suffers a little at the hands of the continuity craze that held the Doctor Who production team in its grip at the time.  For instance, in speculating about who could have interfered with the TARDIS' journey, Peri suggests the Daleks might have been behind it.  Peri hadn't met the Daleks at this point, and it seems unlikely she's know about their time travel technology.<br />However, once out in the English countryside, the story settles down into a more acceptable state, and we get the spectacle of three Time Lords trying to outthink each other.  A good thing which we rarely have had the opportunity to observe.<br />The Bakers' writing style is OK, but I suspect it reflects their unfamiliarity with novel writing.	2001-02-10

So there he and Peri go, only to find themselves caught up in the plot of some time travelling Cybermen...<br />Adapted as a novel by script editor Eric Saward, this book is one of those examples where too many continuity references spoil the plot.  The TV serial upon which it is based was broadcast in 1985, but the book relies upon the events of the 1966 serial 'The Tenth Planet' and the 1967 serial 'Tomb of the Cybermen', as well as some references back to the very first Doctor Who serial ('An Unearthly Child' 1963) and bringing back a character from the previous season (Lytton from 'Resurrection of the Daleks' 1984).  Add to this that the story doesn't get many of the facts right and you know you've got a problem...<br />However, the real problem is that this is an excessively violent Doctor Who story.  Eric Saward's term as script editor saw the violence steadily increasing, and with the new (sixth) Doctor, he went overboard.<br />Stripped back and completely rewritten, this could have been a good story.  Sadly, it isn't.	2001-02-10

It's the Sixth Doctor, so you know the answer to this question is bound to be both violent and unpleasant...<br />I have heard this book was originally planned to be a Doctor Who-Judge Dredd crossover.  The fact that it isn't is, I think, a good thing - Earth's history in Doctor Who is convoluted enough without adding another fictional history on top of it.  And I'm not terribly fond of Judge Dredd.<br />However, it seems that the storyline wasn't sufficiently rewritten to cope with Dredd's excision.  With the Doctor spending much time incarcerated, Peri is portrayed in an uncharacteristically violent way which I assume is in part because she takes on roles that were set for Dredd.<br />That said, Dave Stone does find some replacement of the missing Judge Dredd trappings by using the Adjudicator's Guild, much expanded upon while Virgin had the licence to produce Doctor Who, and so fits the story back into the Doctor Who universe quite successfully.<br />Not the greatest of Doctor Who novels, and perhaps too reminiscent of the worst aspects of the Sixth Doctor's tenure, it probably isn't a book that will satisfy the casual Doctor Who readers.  Those of us who read them all will read it anyway, and it may also be good for Dredd fans as it contains (I think!) quite a bit they will like.	2001-02-09

There is a threat from the future menacing a girl with two hearts.  A girl who calls the Doctor &quot;Dad&quot;...<br />Normally, when I get my Doctor Who books for the month, I start with the Past Doctor book - mostly out of comfort.  This time, though, the magic name &quot;Lance Parkin&quot; made me start with the Eighth Doctor book.  As I've said elsewhere, if you see Lance Parkin's name on the cover, get it.<br />This book is set in the 1980s, and Mr. Parkin is reveling in it.  There are regular references to songs of the period (and the book takes place over the decade, so there is a variety of music, too), and he takes then effort to remind you of what we now take for granted that people in the 80s did  not.<br />After 'The Infinity Doctors', you just know that Lance Parkin is the right man to write a book in the current story arc.  In that book, we had a Doctor who was both familiar and strange - and so too do we have another familiar and strange Doctor in this book.  And given how largely non-Canonical 'The Infinity Doctors' was, surprise surprise - there are some links between that book and this.<br />Mr. Parkin also writes with a moderate sense of mischief, strewing the book with many references to the history of Doctor Who.  I won't spoil them for you, other than mentioning that two of the chapters are entitled 'Escape Velocity' (the title of the next Eighth Doctor book) and 'Death Comes to Time' (the new Doctor Who radio serial, currently in production).<br />And the Doctor's daughter?  She's mentioned in the blurb, so I feel no guilt in mentioning her here.  But you'll need to read the book to see exactly who she is - maybe.  Like many good authors, there is just enough uncertainty about the character that you want another book to make it clearer.	2001-02-09

Reyburn - I haven't seen, read or heard any others.<br />I found it rather unsatisfying.  The plot is fairly thin (it relates to a train shipment of gold that has gone missing without any obvious places it could be hidden), and I didn't find the deductive abilities of Sherlock Holmes well-portrayed.<br />I also wasn't pleased by the depiction of Holmes, Watson, Mrs. Hudson and most especially Mycroft Holmes.  Holmes himself seemed too supercilious and Watson, supposedly his perfect foil, seemed particularly dim.  But Mycroft...  Sherlock's brother is meant to be at least his equal in deductive abilities, but this Mycroft must have slipped out for a quick lobotomy before the performance.<br />Had the play been either a good demonstration of Holmes' deductive powers, or portrayed the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle characters in a truer form, it would have been fine by me.  But to fail on both counts is a very sad thing.<br />It might be more enjoyable to hear in performance rather than simple reading, where the work of the actors might overcome my misgivings to one degree or another.	2001-02-09

Both these are clues to the strange happenings that are starting to engulf the small fishing village on the island...<br />The Sixth Doctor's era is rightly remembered as the most gruesome of the TV series, and this book fits right in.  Taking a lead from movies like 'Night of the Living Dead', the Doctor, Peri and newly acquired friends from the village progress slowly through a story that, at points, literally drips blood.  Some of the occurrences are not for the squeamish.  And you may find yourself shouting at characters who do things you know they shouldn't from what you've seeing various horror movies.<br />Justin Richards ties the whole thing together with a suitably Who-style explanation, showing yet again the highly flexible nature of the series which can fit a horror gore-fest within its milieu without any problems.	2001-01-31

The TARDIS crew find themselves arrive on Barclow, which is a planet claimed by both the humans and the Chelonians, who are waging a war in a very polite fashion (hence the title).  But there are also other matters afoot, and a great enemy (whose identity I'm not at liberty to divulge here) is behind a complex plot to destroy the Doctor.  Oh, and K9 runs for president as well...<br />This book is the last of Virgin's Missing Adventures series, featuring past incarnations of the Doctor.  The decision not to renew Virgin's license plays a subtle role throughout the book, up to an including the very tongue-in-cheek ending.<br />The Doctor and Romana are yet again well characterised by Gareth Roberts, and the return of the Chelonian (originally created by Gareth Roberts for the seventh Doctor novel, 'The Highest Science') make a welcome return.  The book also looks at a few other important aspects of Doctor Who history and plays a role in setting up the Bernice Summerfield adventure series that Virgin published following BBC re-claiming the Doctor Who license.<br />It is both a great book and important for defining what was to come.	2001-01-30

The reason?  A rare ore (Zeiton-7) essential to time travel has been exhausted and there is none left on board.  However, there is just enough energy left for a jump to Varos, one of the few sources of zeiton ore in the universe.  But Varos is a former prison colony and some particularly unsavoury practices are still in place, which lead the Doctor and Peri into contact with rebels...<br />This novel is adapted by the original scripter of one of the best stories of Colin Baker's first full season as the lead in Doctor Who.  Like much of that season its has a number of hallmarks which really shouldn't have been allowed to become common - violence, including and especially on the part of the Doctor, and a seeming disregard for pain and suffering.<br />By the same token, this story introduces some good elements - Sil, one of the few recurrent foes from the Sixth Doctor's period (but given how short it was, that's hardly surprising!) and a fairly post-modern version of a Greek chorus, where minor characters Etta and Arak provide a commentary on the story which is also a critique of TV violence, advertising and other issues.	2001-01-29

The TARDIS arrives above Earth in the year 2084, where things are quite tense.  The world is broken in two hostile power blocs, fingers poised on their respective buttons.  The TARDIS arrival is in the area under surveillance of  an armed satellite, the Doctor dematerialises the ship and arrives in a Seabase, one of the lines of defence in Earth's cold war.  There arrival corresponds to the plans of the Silurians and Sea-Devils, the original inhabitants of Earth...<br />This novel by Terrance Dicks is based on the original script by Johnny Byrne, who previously wrote 'The Keeper of Traken' and 'Arc of Infinity'.  While Mr. Byrne's scripts started out quite good, they deteriorated over these stories (and one must ask to what extent script editor Eric Saward played in this...).<br />The problem with 'Warriors of the Deep' is that it is notionally a sequel to the Third Doctor stories 'The Silurians' and 'The Sea-Devils'.  It contains references to previous encounters with these races - but which has no real resemblance to the earlier stories.<br />Reading the book gives you a huge advantage over those viewing the TV serial - you don't have to look at the Myrka, and you can imagine a truly horrendous monster...	2001-01-29

After a random jump, the TARDIS is entered by an alien being who sets some coordinates and vanishes.  They find themselves at zero coordinates, a place that looks initially like a featureless void.  But there is another ship trapped here, and a gateway between universes, if only they can work out how to use it.  And the remnants of a war that just won't end...<br />Very stylish visually on TV, this story doesn't immediately translate that well to the written medium.  However, Steve Gallagher (the original author, here writing under the pseudonym John Lydecker) adds additional material to help bridge the translation problem.<br />If you didn't understand the original TV serial (which was pretty short on explanation), this may help.	2001-01-27

The Doctor and new companion Peri, having left the desolate planet of Sarn, arrive in Astroville and witness the murder of a shopkeeper.  As he dies in the arms of the travellers, he gives them the coordinates to the lost treasure of Rovan.  So off on a treasure hunt go the travellers, but find they are not the only ones and that they must compete in a number of challenges to win through...<br />I think the worst Doctor Who book in the BBC range, 'The Ultimate Treasure' is a shocker!  Characterisations of the Doctor and Peri are off, the whole treasure hunt competition makes no great degree of sense, the puzzles and challenges aren't that challenging, and...  Well, I could go on and on.<br />I'm not giving this 1 star because, despite my dislike of it, Christopher Bulis is sufficiently professional that it hangs together fine.

However, the TARDIS crew are not the only unusual visitors to Earth at this time: a spaceship has crashed there, and its occupants have plans which threaten Earth's future...<br />One of Doctor Who's strengths is portraying strange events in an historical setting.  'The Visitation' is a fine addition to this tradition, with a lively storyline, an interesting new alien race, and a degree of individuality shown by the companions - with three (Adric, Nyssa and Tegan), it sometimes transpires that they seem interchangeable.  And then there's Richard Mace, a fine supporting character who adds some local colour (if you can use that term in a temporal sense) to the proceedings.<br />All-in-all, a well thought-out and produced story, appropriately novelised  by it original author.	2001-01-27

This one has an advantage over the first in that the plotline and murders are less far-fetched than those in the earlier book.<br />It retains the good points of the first book: a mix of historical and fictional characters, a sense of humour that doesn't overpower the rest of the book, and a reasonable degree of irreverence.<br />It also has some of the earlier problems: Lestrade is not depicted as a very good detective, and I particularly dislike his technique of  accusing people of being murderers in order to get information.<br />An entertaining series, but not the best on the market.	2001-01-27

But the landing place is no coincidence: a Concorde has disappeared and it seems likely to the Doctor that it was the other ship they materialised to avoid.  Using his UNIT connections, the Doctor arranges to have the TARDIS loaded onto a second Concorde and it is flown on the same path as the missing plane - and also vanishes down a time contour to...<br />The novelisation of the story given the unenviable task of finishing up Doctor Who's nineteenth season, 'Time-Flight' is inevitably overshadowed by 'Earthshock' and Adric's death.   It also has a less coherent storyline than its immediate predecessor, with another old for returning in a somewhat ludicrous disguise and some unbelievable occurrences (for example, how do the Concordes land safely at the other end of the time contour?).<br />Peter Grimwade's novelisation of his own script is competently done, and helps explains some deficiencies in the original TV serial, but it can't overcome the problems inherent in the original storyline.	2001-01-26

Following their adventure on Androzani, the Doctor saved Peri by giving her the only dose of the cure to the poison that had infected them both.  The Doctor has regenerated again - and this time &quot;it feels different&quot;.  Just how different is refelcted in the Doctor's bizarre manic-depressive behaviour, trying to strangle Peri at one moment and then seeking out a solitary planet to become a hermit the next.  But this planet is as unpopulated as it seems, and there is one strand of a complex plot to conquer the universe just outside...<br />Considered by many to be the worst ever Doctor Who TV serial, this is adapted by then-Script Editor Eric Saward.  If you have read other Who reviews by me, you will know that I believe that Mr. Saward did a poor job as Script Editor and lowered the standards of the program.<br />Together, a bad story and someone who really didn't &quot;get&quot; Doctor Who come together to give us a book that really only should ever be purchased by Doctor Who completists.

The characters are many and varied, some of whom have powers, some have super-science weaponry, some are simply people in costumes.  With a whole city of super-beings, we have normal jobs being carried out by people in costumes.  For example, the book begins with fears about the return of the Libra Killer, who in previous years has killed and decapitated prostitutes.  In Neopolis, the prostitutes have super powers, and these are used to play to their clients peccadilloes.<br />Then there is the murder investigation of the death of the Norse god of beauty, Baldur.  Boy, his relatives are an odd bunch - his father Woden, mother Frey, brothers Thunor and Hod, and uncle Lokk may help redefine your view of the Norse gods, especially if you read that other comic with Norse gods...<br />More fun is had by artists Gene Ha and Zander Cannon.  Look closely - you'll find possibly recognisable characters in all sorts of odd circumstances.  My favourite, possibly, is someone who looks like Charlie Brown in a Doctor Doom costume!  How much of this is from Alan Moore's scripts is another question...<br />If I have a problem it is that there is so much happening, so many throw away pieces, so many characters...  It's a little too much.  But then, you can read it over and over again for more detail.	2001-01-26

The intended audience is young adults, and the books concentrate on the adventures of the Baker Street Brigade (or Irregulars), working for Sherlock Holmes. <br />I'm not in the intended audience group, so I should say up front that the writing style of the book isn't exactly what I'm normally looking for, but I suspect that it would be good for the juvenile audience it is aimed at. The writing style is very clean and clear but, for me, lacking in character.  In this particular volume, the three members of the brigade (Danny, Peachy and Duff) are drawn into the events surrounding mysterious deaths and possible sabotage during the construction of the Central and South London Underground Line. <br />In the first three books, the brigade become part of an investigation.  In this one, some odd events come to their attention, and they commence investigation.  It is only later that Sherlock Holmes becomes involved.  While this is preferable, giving the lead characters more control over events, the initial items do seem pretty trivial, making them seem exceedingly nosy.<br />Probably well suited to the &quot;Young Adult&quot; market that it is targeted at.	2001-01-26

The sabotage causes the ship to start to break up, and Nyssa vanishes in an unstable area.  The TARDIS locks onto a nearby space liner, and the Doctor hopes Nyssa is on board it.  But the liner seems abandoned, but there is a dark secret to its journey, and more at the terminus of its trip...<br />The middle story of the Black Guardian trilogy was written by Steve Gallagher and is again novelised by him under the pseudonym John Lydecker.  Given the peculiar wonder of his previous effort, 'Warrior's Gate', one could be excused for expecting another good story.  However, some sad disappointment awaits.<br />While the story isn't all that bad, and works better in a written form than it did as a TV serial, some of the concepts end up being swamped by when in Doctor Who it occurs.  For instance, the Black Guardian plays a relatively small role (it might have been better if it turned out that the liner was part of the plan all the time), Tegan and Turlough are largely sidelined, and a couple of characters, Kari and Olvir, get cast in companion-like roles while real companions spend their time crawling through ducts.  And then there is the pilfering of Norse mythology for names - why call the guards on Terminus 'The Vanir' and the creature 'the Garm'?<br />And so a reasonable story gets drowned in a soup of extraneous ideas and, sadly, Nyssa gets a confused story to leave with.	2001-01-26

This is Carole Buggé's first novel-length Sherlock Holmes adventure, having previously written short stories  in 'The Game's Afoot' and 'The Resurrected Holmes'.<br />While this first novel is a good attempt, I was a little disappointed that I found it fairly easy to work out how the story was going to come out, and who was doing what.  The story not only features Sherlock Holmes, but his brother Mycroft and his opposite number, Professor Moriarty.  With three substantial intellects at work, I really should have been guessing up until the very end.<br />Another problem is the chess motif adopted in the story.  At some points it appears that there is a literal chess game going on, at others that it is a metaphorical chess game.  Since it sometimes one and sometimes the other, some of the things that happen make absolutely no sense in terms of the other paradigm.<br />Having said all that, the portrayal of the characters is good, and the plot line more than passable.  I actually suspect that Ms. Buggé wrote the book so that attentive readers could penetrate the plot, which is certainly preferable to those writers who use Holmes' deductive abilities as deus ex machina.  Ms. Buggé's second Holmes novel, 'The Haunting of Torre Abbey', is on my shelf of unread books and I will read it in due course.  Hopefully some more experience will take the promise of this novel into a mote fully developed book.	2001-01-22

I  was looking for more Sherlock Holmes stories to read, and so this book was a disappointment.  (One of the reasons for writing this review is to allow others to know what it is before they buy it.)<br />Having read it, I'm still disappointed.  While Colin Bruce does a decent job in explaining physics for the layman, I wasn't overly thrilled with his attempts to portray Dr. Watson, Sherlock Holmes, Mycroft Holmes, Professor Challenger and Professor Summerlee, all characters created by the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  Their portrayal is variable, and bends to suit the explanatory purpose of the book rather than remaining true to the characters.<br />Given that the book is et in Victorian London, its explanation of scientific theories that weren't derived until decades later is also disappointing.  Had the minds featured in the book been able to come up with the theories that they did before 1901, we'd be more advanced than we are.<br />Possibly useful to help explain physics to the layman, but not much use for Sherlock Holmes aficionados.	2001-01-22

The TARDIS arrives, but it appears to be a primitive agrarian society.  The local villagers appear somewhat shocked, not only by the presence of strangers but by their enquiries about scientists.  They report them to the Tower.<br />Who lives in the Tower?  Why is science banned?  And what about Adric, who has stowed away in the TARDIS and is now wandering an alien world?<br />'State of Decay' was originally written some years earlier, but was not made for fear that it would be seen as sending up BBC's production of 'Dracula', which would have been shown around the same time.  It is odd to see a story of vampirism in Doctor Who (and this has paved the way for several other vampire tales in the novels - 'Blood Harvest', 'Goth Opera' and 'Vampire Science'), but it does work to some extent.  Unfortunately, it gets a bit silly towards the end.	2001-01-22

But some fusing of the local sands shows a spaceship has been here, and that there is a minor war going on between the rulers on nearby Androzani Major and the rebel, Sharaz Jek, hidden on this planet.  But even that is only the surface, and there is a complex plot behind it all...<br />Taking the elements of his earlier script and adding in some 'Phantom of the Opera' riffs, Robert Holmes produced what is considered by many to be the finest story featuring the Fifth Doctor.  It is here adapted by Terrance Dicks.<br />The layering of plots behind this story, which benefits from the absence of oppressed primitives and a giant monster, slowly peel away as the Doctor and Peri resolve one problem only to find another.<br />Worth a look, although the TV serial is better.	2001-01-22

No one knows where they are,  but the Doctor was teaching Tegan how to set the coordinates.  Why she set them for Manusa soon becomes plain, as the Mara makes its presence plain.  A struggle for Tegan's mind is about to begin...<br />Following on from 'Kinda', 'Snakedance' sees the Mara cast as a threat against a completely different society than that which we saw last time.  This is a successful sequel: it retains strengths from the story upon which it is based, but casts it sufficiently differently that you have no risk of mistaking which story is which.<br />Given the mystical/spiritual side to the story, it probably could have done with a more subtle noveliser than Terrance Dicks.

Trow has written a series of (I think!) 16 books about Inspector Sholto Lestrade of Scotland Yard.  Lestrade will be (more or less) recognisable to readers of the Sherlock Holmes stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br />In this book, though, those stories are pure fiction.  Lestrade is not as incompetent as Holmes' many fans have been led to believe, and indeed, Doyle has taken liberties with the real Sherlock Holmes, a not terribly bright consulting detective.<br />In this book, Lestrade is investigating a series of murders which turn out, unsurprisingly, to be related.  The story is richly populated with historical characters, who wander in and out of the story with great regularity.  Some of them are even considered, if briefly, as suspects.<br />Mr. Trow has an interest in the period, not the least of which is in the mysterious murderer known as Jack the Ripper (he has written 'The Many Faces of Jack the Ripper'), and the Ripper gets some mention in this book.  Lestrade's immediate superior is Sir Melville McNaghten, who was a senior officer involved in the Ripper investigations.<br />I would have preferred if the book involved more detective work - Lestrade's methods are pretty hit and miss - but the nature of the murders are bizarrely amusing.<br />There is also a significant streak of comedy in the book, mostly of the punning kind, but quite often this is may lead you to think that the characters, rather than the author, are joking.<br />It's an interesting book, although perhaps not everyone's cup of tea.	2001-01-18

Here they are drawn into a series of events including a crime committed with the modus operandi of a criminal some three years dead, the peculiar art of Menlove Stokes, and the operations of the Nisbett brothers and their Ogron thugs.<br />This novel is written with a very light hand, and flows wonderfully.  Gareth Roberts captures the characters of the Doctor and Romana brilliantly, and Menlove Stokes, who returns in 'The Well-Mannered War' is a great supporting character.

Authors doing this seem to get caught up with adding new and &quot;interesting&quot; facts, which somehow manage to detract from the original.  They aren't original enough where they should be, and do not play to their original's strengths to the extent they should.  Having said that, 'The Sands of Time' isn't as bad in that respect as, say, 'Twilight of the Gods'.<br />A sequel to the classic 'Pyramids of Mars', this book starts when the TARDIS materialises in the British Museum's Egyptian wing.  The TARDIS crew are obviously comfortable with travelling, as they take their collective eye off the game for a moment and Nyssa is kidnapped.  The Doctor and Tegan then meet a man who has met them, but whom they have never met, and end up at the unwrapping of a mummy.  It is Nyssa, and she has been entombed for 4000 years...<br />While I'm not terribly impressed with its tie-ins with 'Pyramids of Mars', this book does have quite a number of redeeming features.  The plot itself has very carefully thought through time travel aspects, relates closely to the milieu of the Fifth Doctor, and doesn't pull rabbits out of hats - the reader is handed several important pieces to the resolution of the story at the beginning, and their actual role becomes plain late in the book.<br />More importantly, the characters and their relationships are central.  There are some occasions when you may wonder why some the people who have travelled in the TARDIS continue to do so.  In this book, the importance of the characters to each other shows through very strongly.<br />Not a great sequel, but still a good book.	2001-01-18

But as the Doctor and Turlough argue, Kamelion sets course for the source of the alien signal: Earth!  And so is set in motion the story that will see the Doctor travelling on without either Turlough and Kamelion...<br />The penultimate TV serial of the Fifth Doctor is novelised by its original scripter, Peter Grimwade.  To set things in place for the new Doctor, he has the task of clearing out accumulations from the Fifth's period (that's Turlough and Kamelion, Tegan having departed in the unnovelised 'Resurrection of the Daleks'), tying up their respective stories, and introduce a new companion, Peri.  And tell a story that stands on its own in the meantime.<br />The result is a little mixed, but still quite reasonable.  Turlough is given a substantial role in this story, and it is the second TV serial in which Kamelion actually does anything.  Resolving their back-stories lays much of the story's basics in place.  And, while I won't tell you exactly who, one of the Doctor's old enemies has a substantial role to play as well.<br />This story is inextricably tied with the show's history, and hence may contain elements that could confuse someone with no real familiarity with the show.	2001-01-16

Although, given that the two authors' contributions are in different typefaces, one must assume that the credits have been negotiated Hollywood-style since Mr. Russell certainly contributed more words.<br />This book probably has a limited audience (although some people would say &quot;It's a Doctor Who book!  Of course it's only got a limited audience!&quot;), and it is hard for me to imagine exactly who it is for.<br />I found it interesting enough, but tales of negotiating a particular property, no matter how interested I am in that property, through the maze of TV production really isn't my kind of thing.<br />Information on discarded versions of the story (and I'm so glad they were discarded!) are probably the most interesting part of the book for me.<br />I also found the very different ways of expressing themselves employed by Messrs. Segal and Russell interesting to read, but unless you have an interest in the content then that's hardly going to get you in.<br />If you are interested in Doctor Who as a TV show (as opposed to the story told on the TV show), or interested in the internal politicking of TV production, this may be the book for you.	2001-01-16

The Doctor takes the TARDIS to the village of Little Hodcombe, in order to visit Tegan's grandfather.  Initially it appears that they have arrived in the wrong time period, but in fact there is an historical reenactment of a battle during the English Civil War being carried out.  But there is something more at work behind the scenes, and Tegan's grandfather is missing...<br />Based on a 2 episode TV serial by the scriptwriter Eric Pringle, this book seems less rushed than the original series (which probably should have been 3 episodes long).  With a little more time and room, the story is better in this form than the televised version.<br />Unfortunately, the story itself has some problems not uncommon in Doctor Who.  The Doctor has two companions, Tegan and Turlough, who each end up with not much to do.  Instead, some supporting characters that feature in this story get to do all the companion-type things.  One would have hoped that the story could have been written a little differently to allow the regulars larger roles.<br />However, the idea behind the story is quite a good one, so this particular failing is probably something more likely to be seen in retrospect rather than as the story progresses.	2001-01-14

The only real failure, in my view, was 'The Little Problem of the Grosvenor Street Furniture Van',  but I readily accept that this is due to my personal tastes.  The story is notionally written by Arthur Stanley Jefferson (better known by the name he acted under, Stan Laurel) and is a slapstick comedy story.  I've never been a fan of slapstick, and even if I had some fondness for it I'd rather see it in its best medium, something visual.<br />Having said that, the other 14 stories were all fine with me.  I'll take the opportunity to specifically mention 'The Affair of the Counterfeit Countess' by Craig Shaw Gardner, which proves that you can tell a successful Holmes story and still be funny, and 'The Secret Marriage of Sherlock Holmes' by Shariann Lewitt, which lives up to its title (!).  Both these step outside what one might expect in a Sherlock Holmes story and pull it off well.	2001-01-14

Frontios is a planet under siege, with meteor showers occurring regularly - indeed, the TARDIS materialises during one, and some of those in authority wonder of the events are linked.  While plainly not welcome, the travellers find themselves unable to leave when the TARDIS is destroyed in a second meteor shower.  What is causing these?  Why do bodies go missing?  And how will the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough ever leave without the TARDIS?<br />A return effort from Christopher Bidmead, probably best known for authoring the last Fourth and first Fifth Doctor stories 'Logopolis' and 'Castrovalva', adapts his own script of this Fifth Doctor serial.<br />'Frontios' is not up to his earlier work in terms of quality, but is still a decent enough story.  This story also sheds a little more light on Turlough, which is welcome and long overdue.  Of course, one cannot help but wonder what happened to Kamelion when the TARDIS was destroyed?  There are a few niggling things like that which detract from the story.	2001-01-14

The TARDIS arrives on a moon of Delta Magna, and the Doctor and Romana set off to find the fifth segment through the swamp, leaving K9 behind.  But the actual location of the segment is vague - the tracer gives a reading over a wide arc.  Their attempts to locate the segment are complicated by the situation on the moon: a gas refinery is harvesting the swamp's output, but is under siege from the Swampies, the original inhabitants of Delta Magna who have been relocated to this moon.  Rumours of the arrival of gunrunner Rohm Dutt are causing much tension...<br />The fifth story in the Key of Time sequence is a bit of a mixed bag.  Originally written by Robert Holmes, one of the best writers in the series' history, it shows every sign of being a rather rushed job.  Interestingly, the bare bones of this story were later reused by Mr. Holmes in the last Peter Davison Doctor Who story, 'The Caves of Androzani', to much better effect.<br />Readers of this book are spared some of the poor (so-called) special effects that plague the video production of the story, however the adaptation by Terrance Dicks doesn't help rise this story out of its own mire.	2001-01-14

The Doctor steers the TARDIS back to Earth, and arrives some ten years earlier than intended - in the 1970s.  This was the time when his third incarnation had been exiled and later made his base of operations, and when many aliens sought to invade Earth.  Now in his fifth incarnation, the Doctor find himself, along with companions Tegan and Turlough, drawn into the UNIT investigation of strange occurrences in the coastal resort of Tayborough Sands, which turns out to be quite gruesome...<br />Setting a Fifth Doctor story in the milieu more associated with is third incarnation is, perhaps, a little risky - on the printed page, the specific incarnation of the Doctor can be hard to maintain plainly in the mind of the reader, so surrounding him with events and characters that evoke a different incarnation can make this even more difficult.  Then there are continuity problems: if this Doctor meets people he knows earlier in time than when he has otherwise met them, the writer has to include reasons why these encounters aren't remembered.<br />This is the problem I have with 'Deep Blue' - the story that Mark Morris is telling here gets swamped by all the things he needs to do to maintain continuity, and the reader has to keep reminding hi/herself that when the Doctor is talking to the Brigadier, Yates or Benton that this is the Fifth Doctor.<br />While Mr. Morris doesn't do a bad job at this, the book would have been better had it been a Third Doctor or if the UNIT elements had been from some time other than that strongly associated with the Third.<br />Also, the nature of the alien invasion depicted herein is, perhaps, not for those with weak stomachs...	2001-01-12

A very good thing to be made to do.<br />Make no mistake: this book will not be a comfortable read to all.  As it indicates in the blurb (which I didn't read first), one of the characters in the book was sexually abused by his father starting at age four.  Now, the details of this are not examined closely, but we are never allowed to forget how Pete was abused.  It's not in our faces, but it's never too far below the surface.<br />Having said that, the book is a triumph.  Mixing fiction and autobiography together, Armistead Maupin sets out a book which is about the way in which fiction is created.  The book is the fictionalised account of Gabriel Noone's failing relationship, his long-distance meeting with a young survivor of sexual abuse, and how the two help each other forward, and all the trials and tribulations associated with that progress.<br />But don't get comfortable: 'The Night Listener' turns your expectations on their heads on several occasions.<br />Mr. Maupin also remembers his long time fans: there are several nods to the 'Tales of the City' series and its characters.  If you haven't read those books, I don't think that this book would suffer, but if you have, you get a few little bonuses.<br />As good a book as I have read in a long time.	2001-01-12

This is the novelisation of the anniversary story, adapted by the script writer, Terrance Dicks.<br />From the title, you will be unsurprised to hear that the story teams up the first five incarnations of the Doctor (well, more or less - on TV, Tom Baker wasn't interested in returning so soon to the show, so the Fourth Doctor's role in negligible) against a big threat, the nature of which I can't reveal in this review for those who don't know the story.<br />As well as five Doctors, we have numerous companions and old enemies in roles of varying importance - some are cameos, others (like contemporary companions Tegan and Turlough, the Doctor's granddaughter Susan, the Brigadier, and Sarah) have more substantial parts to play.<br />The story also probes more into the history of Gallifrey and the Time Lords.<br />In many respects, the results is sometimes like a &quot;best of&quot; Doctor Who, but there are some surprises.  But it isn't challenging, and it isn't amazingly original.  But it is a celebration of the most successful science fiction show ever on TV.	2001-01-09

The Doctor, Tegan and Turlough are enjoying a meal in a restaurant when they are swept up in a space-time event and wind up in the Crystal Bucephalus - a restaurant wherein diners can choose any restaurant from history to dine in, and the space-time mechanism of the Bucephalus will arrange it.  And the Doctor, much to his chagrin, is the owner - having invested mnoney to lose it in the restaurant's creation.  But with space-time accessible from the Bucephalus, there are others who are keen to get their hands on it...<br />Setting this book in a restaurant is an inspired idea, as you may very well feel like you've had a banquet by the time you are finished.  The Doctor, Tegan and Turlough are quite well portrayed, and even Kamelion gets to do something (although it is, yet again, being controlled by someone else...).<br />While you are enjoying the main plotline, the story is embroidered with many many references to Doctor Who (and other, including Star Trek) trivia.<br />While perhaps a little rich for some tastes, it is still a book many will savour!	2001-01-08

But the message is incomplete, and the location appears to be an Edwardian racing yacht.  But many things are considerably more than they seem...<br />'Enlightenment' is a great story that, unfortunately, suffers slightly in the translation from TV to book, because the visual impact of some of  the scenes is lessened in the written word.  Barbara Clegg, who wrote the screen play, does a great job in translating the story despite the fact that (I believe) she originally wrote it thinking about how it would look presented visually.<br />Unlike 'Terminus', 'Enlightenment' makes its place in the Black Guardian trilogy an important aspect of the story overall, and is therefore comfortably placed.  Unlike some Doctor Who stories, the bad guys operate on a more intellectual level, so that overcoming them cannot rely upon force of strength.  Indeed, the Eternals, who feature in this story, are sufficiently outside normal human morality that they can be cast in roles as both allies and enemies.  The Doctor, Turlough and Tegan and have roles to play, and Turlough in particular is in a role that no other regular character in the series could be convincingly cast in.<br />A worthwhile addition to Doctor Who's history.	2001-01-07

But not this one.<br />My impression is that the idea for a short story occurred, but it was padded out to make is a short novel instead.  Worse still, there is very little in the way of deduction in this story.<br />The title itself is a little misleading, and the depiction of the regulars (including Inspector Lestrade) is done more as parodies than characters.<br />And then there is a jokey bit, where law officers refuse to believe that Holmes and Watson are themselves because they don't look like the Sidney Paget illustrations from the Strand magazine.  The author found this so enjoyable that it gets used twice.<br />Not atrocious, but not what I'd expect from Val Andrews either.	2001-01-07

So they leave the metal mutt to dry out and start a different holiday, at the Leisure Hive on Argolis.  Argolis is a sterile wasteland since the war with the Foamasi, and the Leisure Hive is the only way they can continue to survive, through the money paid by galactic tourists.  But its not all fun and games, and their is murder afoot, and the Doctor is the number one suspect...<br />Season eighteen of Doctor Who, Tom Baker's last in the role, starts off with this story.  This story is a great improvement on what we were served up in season seventeen and the novelisations also had a change as well - many of them are now written by the original authors, rather than the ubiquitous Terrance Dicks.  The upshot of this is that the novels themselves are fresher, and tend to expand on the original TV serial rather than simply recounting them.<br />This one has a good storyline, with several twists, and David Fisher's writing style is quite good as well.	2001-01-07

His intention is to obtain the measurements of the real one to assist in repairing the TARDIS' chameleon circuit.

The Doctor gains two companions (Nyssa, who first appeared in 'The Keeper of Traken', and Tegan), faces an old foe, and gives his life to save the universe.<br />The story is quite clever, tying in with many events of the seventeenth season, and setting in motion the first story of the next season.<br />The adaptation  is by Christopher Bidmead, the author of the original script, and is quite worthwhile as well.

While she does so, the Doctor, Adric and Tegan set out to explore the jungle around the ship.  And it is more complicated than it looks: strange wind chimes, natives who don't speak, and an Earth exploration party who have been vanishing one-by-one are just the surface of a far more complex problem that lurks inside...<br />One of the best stories of Peter Davison's tenure, it is here adapted in a straightforward fashion by the prolific Terrance Dicks.  For those who have some knowledge of Buddhism, the story's basis is plain, but even without that knowledge it remains an excellent, if esoteric, exploration of the mind.<br />If you are particularly fond of big explosions and large scale combat, look elsewhere.  This book achieves both its threat and solution by quieter means and is all the more satisfactory for that.	2001-01-06

He asks the Doctor to come to Traken to ensure that the evil doesn't destroy the Union.  But little does the Doctor know which of his old foes is the evil sensed by the Keeper...<br />The penultimate story featuring Tom Baker as the Doctor, this story is great in its own right but also important in that it sets the stage for the next story, 'Logopolis'.

The third book, 'The Turing Test', was a vast improvement in this regard, the best had yet to come.  In the second prologue to this book, Ace and the Doctor's seventh incarnation see a man who the Doctor thinks looks familiar, but then concludes he has never met before.  It is plain from the description that this man is the Doctor's eighth incarnation, and the two have in fact met...<br />This book is set during the Cold War, and as it progresses the Doctor is drawn into then world of espionage and double agents (Kim Philby is one of the most prominent supporting characters), and comes up against old enemies who remember him from his second and sixth lives, the extradimensional being known as the Players.<br />I've never been a great fan of spy thrillers, so a large part of this book certainly wasn't my cup of tea.  However, there are quite a few scenes that rise from the spy story and plainly mark this as Doctor Who.<br />While I've only rated this 3 stars, that second prologue deserves 5 stars!	2001-01-05

Given the success of their chronicling of the further adventures of the Seventh Doctor, Virgin publishing listened to the requests of their readers and launched a second series: Doctor Who Missing Adventures, featuring the earlier incarnations of the Doctor.  This is the first of the series, and features the Fifth Doctor.  And just to make life interesting, it ties in with the Seventh Doctor book 'Blood Harvest'.<br />From the title and the cover illustration, have no doubts that this is a vampire novel.  Vampires, Doctor Who-style, were introduced in the TV serial 'State of Decay'.  The established ages-old conflict between the Time Lords and vampires puts all kinds of pressure on the TARDIS crew when Nyssa is attacked and transformed...<br />The novel also features a person from the Doctor's past, mentions of old companions, and generally fits in very comfortably in the Doctor Who milieu.

But there is something secret happening on Skonnos...<br />'The Horns of Nimon' is probably the worst Doctor Who story ever featuring Tom Baker in the title role.  It features a  retelling of the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur (including the appearance of the Nimon), and doesn't do it in an entertaining way.  With this novelisation, we are spared some of the poorer effects that were on display on TV, but the story is so poor that nothing could save it.	2001-01-03

This story acts as a sequel to one of the stories in Doctor Who's tenth season, but sadly an imperfect sequel.<br />Like any story set, to whatever extent, on Gallifrey, it looks backwards at the Time Lords history.  I certainly welcome the return of Borusa, the Doctor's old teacher, who is now President of the Time Lords.  Borusa is a very strong character (and events in 'The Five Doctors' have always seemed out of character to me) who enlivens the stories in which he appears.<br />The story is interesting enough, but could have been better if it was either no a sequel to an earlier story, or if it had been more consistent with that story.  There is also some strange physics, which seems largely to justify setting the Earth portion of the story in Amsterdam.  Terrance Dicks adaptation is quite straightforward, but it is a pity he didn't try to include additional bits to make it more consistent with the earlier story.	2001-01-01

Looking at the cover and reading the blurb on my copy offers no clues to either, and this story really emerges like a shark from the deeps, especially when compared to that which proceeded it ('Black Orchid&quot;).<br />It is adapted by Ian Marter, who played companion Harry Sullivan some seven years before the broadcast of this story, and, as I have previously commented, his writing style is rather not the straightforward adaptation that most Doctor Who novelisations enjoy and/or suffer (depending on your view and the novelisation).<br />One substantial complaint (with the original story, and hence also featured in this adaptation): Eric Saward, who began as script editor for this season as well as writing the story in the first place, obviously wasn't happy with the concept of the Doctor not using weapons and solving things by thinking them out.  On the cover of my copy is a photo of the Doctor with a gun, straight from the serial.  A very bad move, Mr. Saward.  This increased violence continued while Mr. Saward was script editor.	2000-12-31

After the game, they are invited to Cranleigh Hall, where it turns out that Nyssa is the spitting image of their host.  But Ann Talbot is in the eye of someone haunting the secret passages of Cranleigh Hall, and Nyssa is therefore just as likely to be the target...<br />One of those odd beasts, the two part Doctor Who serial, here adapted by original scriptwriter Terence Dudley, this book makes the adaptation of several much longer serials seem positively anorexic.  Mr. Dudley takes the opportunity to fill out the story without adding strange appendages (such as, for instance, in the case of 'The Sontaran Experiment').<br />Not as packed with events as many Doctor Who books, this one seems relatively relaxing in pace.	2000-12-31

The TARDIS is invaded by a force from the past, which asks him &quot;How many doors must you slam, Doctor, before you understand the magnitude of what you did?&quot;  And so it's off to the planet Dymok, where a shadow from the past places the present under threat and the Doctor must try to undo a past mistake.<br />Featuring the return of the classic William Hartnell foe, the Celestial Toymaker, and the crowded TARDIS of the Fifth Doctor, Adric, Nyssa and Tegan, this book is written in three parts (or rounds, as it puts them).  The first and third feature the TARDIS crew, but the middle round is an all-star visit to Gallifrey's past to discover exactly how the Doctor and the Toymaker first came to be in conflict.  So many Time Lords you'll need a score card to keep track!<br />Aside from this visit to Gallifrey's past, the other great feature of the book is the characterisation of the Doctor's companions.  For instance, we are treated fairly early on to Tegan's impressions of the Doctor, Nyssa and Adric, and complimentary is not a word that springs to mind.  As the book progresses, discord is sewn amongst the four friends with potentially disastrous results.<br />So, here we have a book which not only deals with the &quot;present&quot;, but has its eyes fixed firmly on the past as well as the &quot;future&quot; - in the form of the unmade but novelised Sixth Doctor story 'The Nightmare Fair'.  If Doctor Who's continuity gives you a headache or makes you nauseous, leave this one to those (like me) who enjoy it.	2000-12-31

The TARDIS materialises at Gallifrey's coordinates, and Gallifrey shows on the scanner, but outside is a completely different planet.  This world, Alzarius, is about to experience Mistfall, when strange monsters emerge from the mist.  The Doctor, Romana and K9 get caught up in the problems of the planet's inhabitants, as well as trying to find out why they aren't on Gallifrey.<br />Adapted from his own TV serial, Andrew Smith, a young Doctor Who fan, produces a great story which rises above many stories written by professional writers.  It also introduces Adric, who becomes a companion of the Doctor at the end of this story.	2000-12-30

The TARDIS materialises in an enormous spaceship, which is en route to Earth.  They meet three aliens: two human-looking (Persuasion and Enlightenment), and one frog-like creature called Monarch.  Monarch invites the TARDIS crew to remain for the short journey to Earth.  The ship also contains some Earth humans from previous visits.  But Monarch has a plan he is not divulging...<br />This story is, perhaps, the weakest of Peter Davison's first season as the Doctor.  Monarch's plan is particularly convoluted, the Doctor's companions are largely undifferentiated from each other, and the story is full of annoying bits, the most annoying of which, to me anyway, is Tegan's ability to speak a particular ancient Aboriginal language - most Australians know nothing of the many Aboriginal languages, let alone be able to converse in them.  It appears simply an effort to recognise Tegan's nationality - the other human passengers, who are Chinese, Greek and Mayan, all speak English!<br />Possibly a good indicator of the relative merit of this story can be see by the fact that, of all the Peter Davison Doctor Who stories, this is the only one not yet released on video.	2000-12-30

Featuring the Fifth Doctor, Adric, Nyssa and Tegan as well as the Seventh Doctor, Roz and Chris, it also shines an unclear spotlight on the origins of Gallifreyan time travel, and introduces a character called 'The Patient'.<br />What is perhaps best in this novel is the conflict between the Doctors.  The Seventh is known for his manipulative nature, and so the open and honest Fifth finds himself trying to oppose his later self.  That both Doctors are portrayed in a sympathetic manner is a tribute to Mr. Parkin's writing skills and familiarity with all aspects of the history of Doctor Who (as you may expect from the author of 'A History of the Universe').<br />Also worth noting: the Patient, or Patience as she is also known, is also featured in 'The Infinity Doctors', also by Lance Parkin, which expands further on this very interesting addition to the Doctor Who universe.	2000-12-29

The Doctor's regeneration is unstable, and he is placed in the Zero Room, which will assist with his recovery.  But the TARDIS is on a new course for the Big Bang, which will destroy it...<br />A satisfactory follow-up to 'Logopolis', with all the companions and the Doctor's new incarnation all with things to do.

A small group of elderly people from the future have established themselves in the 1930s for unknown reasons, and they aren't the only people with access to the time corridor.  And then there's a mysterious vapour which is killing people, and worse...<br />Gareth Robert's follow up to his wonderful 'The Romance of Crime' is another great book.  He has captured the characters of the Doctor and Romana from the seventeenth season wonderfully, and set them in great stories which put that period of Doctor Who (with the exception of 'City of Death') to shame.<br />If you are a Doctor Who fan and you haven't read this, do so.	2000-12-27

Their first landing takes the Doctor and the newly-regenerated Romana to Skaro, to which the Daleks have returned seeking something...<br />This story marks the return of the Daleks after an absence of  five years, and is the first story in a season with Douglas Adams of 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' fame as script editor.  And an odd little thing it is, too.<br />What I don't like about it is that it fails to take itself seriously enough.  (At the risk of sounding like I'm saying &quot;but some of my best friends are...&quot;, I don't object to humour in Doctor Who - but it should be a relatively minor element.)  Romana's regeneration, essentially because she felt like it, devalues the Doctor's own various regenerations, and the Doctor's taunts of the Daleks plainly reduce their value as an enemy.  A bit more thought, and less obsession with humour, could have handled these things much better.<br />And then there's Davros.  After 'Genesis of the Daleks', it became impossible to have a Dalek story without Davros in it.  Why?  I also have a problem with the old &quot;such-and-such is a genius, therefore they can do anything&quot; theory that surrounds supposedly brilliant scientists.  Davros' knowledge is thousands of years out-of-date, there is no reason to assume that he can provide the Daleks with the technological advantage they are seeking.<br />This book (and the video of the same story!) are certainly not a high point in Doctor Who's history.	2000-12-27

As they try to find the being who set up the distress signal, they fall foul of  Chloris' ruler, the Lady Adrasta, who will do anything to retain her ruthless grip on the planet...<br />Season seventeen of Doctor Who seems to be one in which the show lost its way.  As a rule, the stories were less well thought out than they should have been, and contained somewhat ludicrous elements.  'The Creature from the Pit' is one of the worst offenders - science that it would be generous to describe as half-baked, unlikely cultures, and strange creatures all conspire to drown any good points which the story has.<br />If you aren't a Doctor Who completist, look elsewhere.	2000-12-26

But there is trouble: Atrios is at war with its twin, the planet Zeos.  The war has lasted a long time, and Atrios is under the command of the Marshal, its war leader, while the royal family have been reduced to figureheads.  But Princess Astra has other ideas, and her plans are inexorably caught up in the quest for the final segment.<br />One of the problems with the Key to Time series is that it is, perhaps, too long.  The elements introduced five stories earlier finally come to fruition in this story, but have largely been ignored between the first and last story.  And, indeed, the whole of 'The Armageddon Factor' is overshadowed by the anticipated assembly of the Key and confrontation with the Black Guardian that they seem insignificant and even annoying.<br />Which is a bit of a pity, really, since this story contains a substantial antiwar and anti-propaganda message that, I believe, should have been in the foreground rather than hidden behind the almost anti-climatic conclusion to the Key to Time sequence.	2000-12-24

She is preparing to return to the TARDIS when she meets Count Grendel, and there begins a series of events that make up this story.<br />If you are familiar with 'The Prisoner of Zenda', there is not much that will surprise youin this story.  However, it is a quite decent change of pace for Doctor Who, and has sufficient science fiction trappings added that those who don't know the original story probably won't notice.<br />A high adventure romp, well worth a read.

He has in more recent years created a line of comics under the imprint &quot;America's Best Comics&quot;, of which Tom Strong is one of those titles.  This volume reprints the first seven issues of that comic.<br />'Tom Strong' is an attempt to render the male super hero in an archetypical form.  This book has a strong science and family theme, with the male lead cast in a paternal role: Tom is a husband and a father, and has other family members around him, and he is also the leader of a society called the Strongmen of America, ordinary people who takes Tom's life as an inspiration.  This book looks over the 100 years that Tom has lived to date, and throughout it he derives benefits from his family/ies and passes them on to the next generation.<br />What's good: Tom represents all those things we have enjoyed about many characters in the past.  You'll spot echoes of Tarzan, Doc Savage, Superman, Tom Swift and many more as you read.  Alan Moore has built an impressive back-story, which reveals itself slowly as the book unfolds, and everything fits together very well.  Tom is also a thinker, rather than just a brawler - he overcome problems with his brain more than his fists.  Tom's wife, Dhalua, and daughter, Tesla, are also fabulous characters.<br />What's not so good: I gave it 5 stars, so not much.  My main complaint is that that many of the villains are overly stereotypical for me.  With a little more effort, they could have been more rounded people.  I could also have lived without the comical sidekicks, talking ape King Solomon and robot Pneuman.<br />Lots of thumbs up, and also check out Alan Moore's female archetype in 'Promethea'.	2000-12-22

The third of six stories in the Key to Time sequence (the second, the Pirate Planet, was never novelised), this story sees the TARDIS taking the Doctor, Romana and K9 to modern day Earth where the trace of the segment suddenly vanishes.  Instead, they find a ring of standing stones, large footprints, an archaeological survey, and a cult of druids.<br />Initially quite inventive, I found the end segment of the story (details of which cannot be stated due to the anti-spoiler rules that apply to these reviews) to be somewhat unoriginal.  Terrance Dicks adaptation is fairly pedestrian, but serves the story well enough.<br />One of the things most missed in reading this book is the wonderful performance of  the late Beatrix Lehmann as Professor  Rumford.  So popular was this performance that it is rumoured that it was considered to add her as a new companion.  Sadly, this didn't happen - but you can still see it on video.	2000-12-22

He is obviously a huge fan of Holmes, and has put this book together with a great degree of enthusiasm.  However, it lacks the most important ingredient: skill.<br />The book itself is a odd hodgepodge of things: the best thing is the opening essay, 'The Moriarty Principle', which looks at the role and importance of  Moriarty in defining Sherlock Holmes.  Then we have lots of photos of the Norwegian Explorers of Minnesota, a Sherlock Holmes fan club, poems (more or less - there is a lot more to poetry than just getting things to rhyme!), some essays of aspects of the Holmes canon and related matters (including an examination of whether Holmes' assigned birthday of 6 January really suits the astrological sign that would be his), some scripts and fiction.<br />Sadly, it really isn't worth the cost of the book overall.	2000-12-21

Indeed, it allows the reader to relax into the more complex ideas introduced at the start of the book and get to know Romana, without bombarding us with some of the more convoluted story lines that later became normal for this season.<br />(Incidentally, the second story in this sequence, 'The Pirate Planet', was never turned into a novel.)	2000-12-18

In new Doctor Who fiction is that the stories featuring the previous incarnations are placed between existing television serials, sometime seemingly inappropriately.  This is certainly the case with any novel set during the Key to Time period, of which there have been so far three: 'The Shadow of Weng-Chiang', this book, and 'Heart of TARDIS'.<br />'Tomb of Valdemar' is set between 'The Ribos Operation' and 'The Pirate Planet', and takes advantage of the somewhat prickly nature of the relationship between the Doctor and Romana, only recently flung together by the White Guardian.  This novel moves that relationship along so that the more relaxed dealings between the two travellers in later stories in the season makes more sense.<br />The novel also justifies its existence by claiming that the potential outcome of events told therein may be as significant as those forthcoming events that the assembly of the Key to Time are to prevent.<br />It also has an interesting storytelling device, not normally used in the range: that of a narrator who is involved in the events, retelling the story much later in life.  This adds a different slant to the story, although it does remove any significant dramatic tension around the character who tells the story as you know she survives.<br />My main criticism would be that there are too many plot lines running in this book.  Readers may find it useful to keep a score card to try to track who is doing what and their motivation!<br />Overall, I think the book's good points outweigh its bad, but Simon Messingham should think about simplifying his plotting in the future!	2000-12-18

He refuses to answer any questions from his companions, and directs the TARDIS to Gallifrey.  The invasion of time has begun...<br />The last story in Doctor Who's season fifteen, and the last with Leela as a companion, this story unfolds as it progresses.  No-one in this story knows as much as they think they do, and this drives the story onwards.<br />Particularly good in this story is the Doctor's previous teacher, Borusa, who is quite a bit of fun in his endeavours to act with appropriate dignity in different circumstances, while still playing a real and significant role.<br />Terrance Dicks adaptation is fairly pedestrian, but the story is strong enough to survive this.  The main problem, and not Mr. Dicks' fault, is the departure of Leela under what can only be described as lame circumstances.	2000-12-17

At least, in written form, we are spared the endless CSO background that made the story even more of a chore to watch.<br />Terrance Dicks tries to lift the story from its mire, and makes a good effort, but there wasn't any real way it could be saved.	2000-12-16

Excuse me, they prefer to be called Eight-legs - so excuse me please ladies.<br />And very creepy they are, too.  There they are with psychic powers, and able to possess humans by crouching on their backs (and disappearing, so you don't know who's really possessed).<br />The story is also replete with Buddhist imagery, the return of the disgraced Mike Yates, a strong role for Sarah, a very real and comfortable friendship between the Doctor and the Brigadier, and a surprise person from the Doctor's past.

This is being caused by a Time Scanner being used to probe the origins of an apparently human skull, but one which is from a time some eight million years before mankind evolved.<br />There is an ancient power at work, and the Doctor must deal with it to prevent the end of the world...<br />Chris Boucher is reasonably on form with this story (but not as good as 'Robots of Death') and the adaptation by Terrance Dicks is, while not inspiring, quite reasonable.  The main advantage of this story is that some of the special effects in the TV serial were none-too-special.<br />You may also wish to read this book as background to the eighth Doctor novel, 'The Taking of Planet 5'.	2000-12-14
2177623:US	52724725	R32LK62KLQ9YGY	0312863624	956689859	Against the Brotherhood: A Mycroft Holmes Novel (Mycroft Holmes #1)	Books	4	6	7	N	N	Mycroft Holmes series off with a promising start	Quinn Fawcett has begun a series of books relating to Mycroft Holmes, the older and more intelligent brother of the better known Sherlock.  Mycroft has been a figure of fascination since he first appeared in 'The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter' in 1893, and has often been featured in stories as the man behind the Victorian British secret service.<br />Mr. Fawcett  also takes this view.  He also endeavours to retain Mycroft's depiction as an armchair theorist, although not to the extent that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did, the depiction is at least fairly consistent (unlike, for instance, the depiction in Glen Petrie's 'The Hampstead Poisonings').<br />It is therefore unsurprising to find that the book is largely narrated in the first person by Mycroft's secretary, Paterson Erskine Guthrie, who is also Mycroft's agent in the field.  While Mycroft eventually follows Guthrie into the field later in the novel (and there is an excellent explanation of why no-one notices this), Guthrie is principally in the spotlight, and thus preserving the wonder of his employer's intelligence - much as Dr. Watson does in the Sherlock Holmes stories.<br />Holmes and Guthrie are pitted against the Brotherhood, a secret society who have plans against the many governments of Europe, who are a very nasty bunch.<br />While spy thrillers are not normally a genre of choice for me, this book was quite an entertaining read.  And if you enjoy this, there are another three books (at least!) in the series.	2000-12-13

The Doctor and Leela accompany Stockwood's expedition.<br />The book falls into two parts: the journey and Easter Island.  There are a number of incidents on the journey there, making the first half of the book something of a sea-road trip.  And then Easter Island, including the mystery of the well-known giant head statues.<br />Probably the best aspect of the book is the concentration on Leela's character.  She was popular on TV, but this book truly concentrates on the noble savage in less-than-noble civilisation that makes Leela unique amongst the Doctor's many companions.  Many little details of her life as part of the Sevateem are revealed, so if you are a Leela fan, make sure you get this one.<br />On top of this, the story is good.  Some parts did press very hard against my suspension of disbelief, but it never got to the stage where I couldn't accept the book.<br />Worth a read.	2000-12-09

He has in more recent years created a line of comics under the imprint &quot;America's Best Comics&quot;, of which Promethea is one of those titles.  This volume reprints the first five issues of that comic.<br />'Promethea' is an attempt to render the female super hero in an archetypical form.  This book has a strong mystical or spiritual theme, with the female lead cast in a pluralistic role: she is both Sophie Bangs, student, and Promethea, imagination personified.  Our Promethea is not the first, there is a whole line of Prometheas stretching back to ancient Egypt, and we get to know some of the earlier ones in this book.<br />What's good: as Promethea, Sophie doesn't know all the answers although, it seems, Promethea does (sounds confusing?  Sophie is Promethea, but Promethea isn't Sophie).  Indeed, Sophie finds herself thrust in to a broad canvas full of elements that she doesn't know about or understand.  The book allows for Sophie and Promethea to be intellectual, rather than just wiping the enemies off the face of the Earth (and the Immateria) with her caduceus - even where she does that, it is thought through.<br />What's not so good: I gave it 5 stars, so not much.  My main complaint is that it finishes at an inopportune moment.  Sophie is learning about the four weapons she has, and learns about two and then it stops.  The comic book has continued, so the rest will be in volume 2, but it still a bit inconsiderate.<br />Lots of thumbs up, and also check out Alan Moore's male archetype in 'Tom Strong'.	2000-12-09

Also returning are Uvanov and Toos, two of the Sandminer crew from 'Robots of Death'.<br />For me, especially in comparison to 'Robots of Death', is slow and plodding.  Some of the events seem rather pointless.<br />Whereas 'Robots of Death' was a murder mystery, this book is something of a spy thriller - not one of my favourite genres.  If they suit you better, this might be a book you'll enjoy.	2000-12-08

(Please note: another three stories, probably intended for the series, have been published as 'Footsteps in the Fog').<br />As is probably obvious from the cover, this the repulsive story of Crosby the Banker and the red leech.  In this book we are introduced to Dr. Grimsby Defoe, who is set up as the replacement for Professor Moriarty.  Of course, we know there never was anyone who could assume the role of Moriarty and Holmes regularly complained that there was no challenge left in the London underworld after Moriarty's death.<br />The other thing about Dr. Defoe is that the description given of him is, practically word for word, that of the Devil Doctor himself, Fu Manchu.  A little originality would not have gone astray!<br />There is some slight improvement in other areas: Holmes is not depicted as being willing to accept supernatural matters (a quote from 'The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire' is included).  While there is a Christian homily at the end of the book, at least this is delivered by a priest instead of Holmes.<br />Not really worth your while, unless you want a basic story that borrows far too liberally from other sources.	2000-12-08

This serial was quickly adapted into this novel.<br />The TARDIS materialises in Victorian London, with the Doctor decides to show Leela how her ancestors lived.  Instead, they get caught up in a Fu Manchu-like story filled with a Tong, a mysterious murderer, trips through the sewers, normal animals grown to unusual sizes, and enough revcognisable elements recast in surprising ways.<br />The story is aided and abetted by wonderful supporting characters, not the least being theatre-owner henry Gordon Jago and police pathologist Professor Litefoot.  There are also literary references to Sherlock Holmes, Oscar Wilde, and so on.<br />The story is wonderful, and this book, while it could be better, is still more than acceptable.	2000-12-08

Someone is killing the crew one-by-one, and the travellers are the first suspects...<br />Sort of like I, Robot meets Dune on the Orient Express, the story is a science fiction murder mystery with the characters each having backgrounds that allow for most anyone to have done it.<br />The main problem with the book is that you are deprived of the wonderful costumes and sets that greatly enhanced this story on TV.  This story was sensibly selected as an early video release, and is also one of the earliest DVD releases, so you know it is held in high regard.	2000-12-06

His two novels, which follow on directly are 'Last Man Running', set in a jungle, and 'Corpse Marker', a science fiction story with robots.<br />There is a real resemblance between this book and Leela's first appearance - there are strange and vicious creatures in the jungle, but the real threat is from lost technology.<br />The book's best point is the characterisation of Leela - as the creator of this character, Mr. Boucher shows a real mastery of how to portray her.  It would have been better if the story had been different from the earlier story, it would have been more worthwhile.	2000-12-05

An international terrorist, known as Marcos is apparently in London, and Churchill wants this confirmed and his activities looked into - is he here on a job, or just hiding from the foreign police?<br />I enjoyed this one more than the first - probably the &quot;investigating a murder in a country manor&quot; style story that one featured has been done to death.  This book had a far more palpable sense of events transpiring outside Mrs. Hudson's control, and that failure was a possibility.<br />I have two complaints: the first, as with 'Elementary, Mrs. Hudson', is her friend Mrs. Warner's astral projection ability.  In the first book, it seemed a lazy way to get the sleuths evidence.  In this book, having used it in the first, Sydney Hosier seems to feel almost obliged to do so again, when this time it would have been just as easy to gain the information in another way.<br />Secondly, the book seemed a bit padded.  While I have no problem with &quot;character&quot; bits in books, in fact I encourage them, there is a murder scene about halfway through which seemed somewhat gratuitous (especially the dreams that preceded it).  A bit shorter and more concise would not hurt.	2000-12-05

The year 2000 is fast approaching, and the world is concerned about what the Millennium Bug will bring (ah yes, the good old days!).<br />One company, Condef, promises to provide solutions to every Y2K problem, no matter how unprepared you are.  But someone is gathering together old I2 equipment...<br />The Doctor is duly aided once more by Commander Harry Sullivan of MI5, formerly a travelling companion.  And, while she is largely absent from these pages, Sarah Jane Smith is still a significant player in this book.  (Interestingly, apparently Justin Richards had planned for Harry and Sarah to be married...).<br />The book's main problem is that it suffers from sequelitus - if you've read 'System Shock&quot;, you know a lot of what happens in 'Millennium Shock' even before you pick it up.  Still, it isn't a bad read.	2000-12-04

The Doctor is trying to get Sarah back to her home in South Croydon, but they land in a quarry in which explosive excavation is taking place.  Sarah is caught in the aftermath of an explosion, and buried alive.  When she is rescued, she is clutching a large stone hand.  Shortly after she awakes, she is acting strangely and says &quot;Eldrad must live&quot;...<br />A story of megalomania that transcends death, Sarah is a strong focus of the action.  The story falls neatly into two parts: the possession of humans by the hand of Eldrad, and Eldrad's quest for revenge on the Kastrians.<br />Sarah's departure, while sad, is rather more human than many departures given that it derives from good character interaction between her and the Doctor.<br />If you can get this on video, its better than the book as Lis Sladen turns in a sterling performance and Eldrad should be seen rather than simply read about.	2000-12-04

This story is the first in which the Doctor appears without a regular companion, and it goes a long way to establish what we know about the Doctor's home planet.  For some people, this made the Time Lords real, for others it ruined the concept.<br />The story depicts the Time Lords as a very political, short-sited group.  Their President is assassinated, and it appears that the Doctor is responsible.  The Doctor is, more or less, assisted by his old teacher, Cardinal Borusa, who plays a substantial role in the background.  This relationship between former teacher and pupil is central to several later stories.<br />This story also sees the return of...  But the would be telling!<br />Personally, I think this story betters the Doctor Who universe, because the prospect of omnipotent Time Lords sitting off at the side watching things really doesn't fit with what we have seen them do to this point.	2000-12-03

The Egyptian artifacts are more than they seem, mummies start to walk, and the small cast of the story are soon trapped within a force barrier, as Sutekh, an ancient evil, tries to return to wreak his revenge...<br />The book lacks the wonderful scenery and period costumes of the original TV serial, but the period feel is retained.  This is the story where the Doctor is plainly cutting his strong ties to UNIT, and becoming once more a wanderer: &quot;I'm a Time Lord, remember, not a human being... I walk in eternity.&quot;<br />As well as retelling this great story in the novel format, Terrance Dicks adds both a prologue and an epilogue that add to the story.<br />It's a great piece of Doctor Who, enjoyable in this book or on video (or both).	2000-12-02

The Doctor has spotted some pictures of alien pods found in the Antarctic permafrost, and takes it upon himself to investigate.  His decision corresponds to a crisis at the Antarctic base, and so the Doctor and Sarah head down in time to find that one of the scientist has been infected by the pod and is transforming into a savage plant-human hybrid.  A pair of travellers who claim to have gotten lost are trying to find the second pod, and there are forces in play that are not obvious to the Doctor.<br />The story is the last appearance of UNIT for many years, and none of the UNIT regulars are featured.  Their absence is made up, at least in part, by strong characters such as Harrison Chase and Amelia Ducat (although the latter is sadly underrepresented in this book).<br />Overall it is an unsurprising story, but amusing all the same.	2000-12-02

With 'System Shock', Justin Richards gives this a go by reintroducing Harry Sullivan some twenty years after his travels in the TARDIS.<br />The Doctor and Sarah arrive on Earth in 1998, where they are drawn into an MI5 investigation of I2, a software company.  They meet up with Harry, now an Assistant Chief of Staff of MI5, who assists them in this story of alien takeover via the Internet.<br />I found the returning Harry to be an excellent addition to the story.  At the time of his travels with the Doctor, Harry was an often bumbling do-gooder who seemed more capable of getting in people's way than assisting.  His time post-UNIT has made him a much more competent character without destroying his essential Harryness.<br />Also pleasing are the different reactions of the Doctor and Sarah to this older Harry.  It's normal for the Doctor, but Sarah is shocked.  It brings home the reality of time travel to her.<br />The story is pretty stock-standard, not different enough to warrant that close an examination, but it does provide a background on which the interaction of these characters can be watched.<br />'System Shock' has generated a sequel, 'Millennium Shock' which should please those who enjoy this book.	2000-12-02

Forced to materialise there temporarily, the TARDIS picks up an unwelcome passenger in the form of a ball of Mandragora energy, which forces the TARDIS off course to 15th century Italy.<br />There, Prince Giuliano is in a precarious position politically, under threat from his uncle Count Frederico, and the second, hidden threat of the Brotherhood of Demnos, a black-magic cult that Mandragora plans to use for its own ends...  Caught up in political intrigue and the manipulations of a secret society, the Doctor and Sarah must prevent the annexation of Earth by the Mandragora Helix.<br />'The Masque of Mandragora' was an excellent TV serial, and makes the transition to the written page under the pen of its producer, Philip Hinchcliffe.  The adaptation is a reasonable one, but perhaps suffers from the lack of the wonderful scenery of Portmeirion, where the serial was shot.  However, the story is a strong one and makes a good transition to the novel form.	2000-12-02

But the planet has a very large secret, one which threatens the whole universe...<br />'The Planet of Evil' is one of those Doctor Who serials that so many people seem to love, but which leaves me cold (perhaps not a surprise, as it was written by Louis Marks, who also wrote 'Inferno', which falls into the same category.

Here he meets journalist Sarah Jane Smith, who is posing as her Aunt Lavinia, a noted virologist, in the hopes of getting a scoop.<br />As it turns out, the scientists have been kidnapped by Jingo Linx and taken back to the Middle Ages, where he has crash-landed and used his technology to travel forward for the skilled help he needs to repair his spaceship.  The Doctor also heads back in the TARDIS, with Sarah stowing away...<br />A fun mediaeval romp with a realistically threatening alien foe, the story was a great start for the series' eleventh season.

Terrance Dicks does a fair job of adapting the story, but the visuals are sadly missed.  Except the Skarasen.  The written version is much better than what we saw on TV!	2000-12-01

This, combined with elements from Doyle's own stories, should mean that regular Sherlock Holmes readers will feel comfortable with this book.<br />Having said that, it should also be noted that the stories do not push any boundaries of the Holmes canon, and so while comfortably reassuring in their familiarity, are unlikely to spark strong passions.<br />A satisfying if unchallenging read for Holmes enthusiasts.	2000-11-30

He makes the rendezvous and meets up with the Brigadier, now in his seventies but back with UNIT in an advisory capacity.  There is a problem, and the Brigadier thinks the Doctor's assistance is required.<br />And so begins a complex tale with many parties involved: UNIT, the CIA, two races of aliens and a terrorist group called the Sons of Nostradamus.  There are a number of twists and turns, and real danger for all parties.<br />If you've read either the aforementioned 'Devil Goblins of Neptune' or 'The Hollow Men', you won't be surprised to find the book liberally peppered with song titles and lyrics, as well as quotes from televised Doctor Who, all slipped in quite casually for the informed reader, but not so intrusive that I think they would detract for those whose taste in music doesn't match those of Mr. Topping.<br />The role of the CIA in both this book and 'Devil Goblins' opens a number of questions, which I expect we'll see answered in future books.<br />All-in-all, a decent read that blends genres (Doctor Who-style science fiction with X-Files-style science fiction and spy fiction), concentrates on the characters and has a sense of fun.  A worthwhile addition to the series.	2000-11-30

While legends of the ghost have been heard for some time, the effect of sighting the ghost on the lighthouse keeper's wife is extreme.  Once they are there, Homes and Watson discover that there are a number of other events which must be understood to correctly resolve the mystery.<br />This story is an attempt to tell the tale of the politician, the lighthouse and the trained cormorant, mentioned in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 'The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger'.  It fails to do so successfully as Kel Richards fails to address the fact that, in that story, Watson threatens to reveal that story due to attempts made to destroy his case papers, and that at least one reader would understand.  I can't explain why not without detailing the story completely, but suffice to say it does not.	2000-11-29

Aided by Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle, the time travellers investigate exactly what is happening.<br />'Evolution' is best described as a traditional Doctor Who story.  There are no big surprises, but things are sufficiently convoluted that you are unlikely to guess the outcome.<br />John Peel, as is usual for him, peppers the novel with a variety of references to other Doctor Who stories.  I suspect that this would be a satisfying read for Doctor Who fans who favour a traditional approach.	2000-11-29

He tended to fill his story with stereotypes, and reuse set pieces from story to story.  I'm not sure how he wrote 'Genesis of the Daleks'.  I guess it proves that he was a good writer, but perhaps too lazy to give us his best all the time.<br />Terrance Dicks' adaptation is not as good as the story deserves, but it is still quite good.<br />The Doctor, Sarah and Harry are sent on a mission for the Time Lords - the Doctor is instructed to prevent the creation of the Daleks.  This story lands the trio at the end of a thousand year war, which has dragged two civilisations back to almost primitive levels.  But the atomic and biological weapons used earlier in the wars have caused mutations...<br />Davros, the chief scientist of the Kaleds, is determined to make his race stronger through this mutation, and to this end he has designed a machine to house the ultimate mutated form of his race.  Together, mutant and machine will be known as Daleks.<br />Davros is one of the great supporting characters ever created for the show, rather sadly ruined by his subsequent appearances.  The great portrayal by Michael Wisher cannot translate properly to the written page, but he is still great.<br />An epic story worth a read by all Doctor Who fans.	2000-11-29

Karn has a number of spaceships which have crashed on it, with apparently no survivors - any who do are being harvested for spare parts by Condo, the servant of Dr. Mehendri Solon.  But what is he using them for?<br />The heavy gothic overtones of this story are wonderful (although probably better if you watch it on video...) and you can plainly see the influence of  the movie 'Frankenstein' in many parts.

However, something is wrong.  There are mysterious happening and unlikely coincidences which point to the fact that something else is happening.<br />I have this view that, while not all of Terry Nation's Dalek stories are wonderful, whatever else he writes for Doctor Who is worse.  While not as bad as 'The Keys of Marinus', this story isn't too flash either.<br />Labelling the story 'The Android Invasion' goes quite some way to telling the reader (and viewer of the original TV serial) what is happening here.  Terry Nation's use of fairly simple characters doesn't help, and his portrayal of returning UNIT regulars Harry Sullivan and RSM Benton is flat and bland, and since these were the last appearances of these characters (at least on TV), a fairly poor sending off.<br />In the season in which this story appeared, this story was the low point.

This world is big enough for us.  No ghosts need apply.&quot;  His willingness to accept supernatural possibilities in this book is solidly against this view.<br />The story itself, even ignoring these non-Holmesian views, is fairly simple and has some ludicrous aspects that were not well appreciated by me.<br />I also didn't like he sudden Christian homily added at the end of the story.  While I have no doubt that Holmes and Watson are Christians, their religion has never been in focus in the stories, and it seemed grafted on - presumably either reflecting the faith of the author, or because of some endeavour to counterbalance the supernatural elements for some imagined religious group who might object to the supernatural tone.<br />I get the impression that this book was written for a younger audience (although it is not stated so anywhere I can see), but even so I don't think it is a good introduction to Holmes for young readers.	2000-11-28

When it came to writing original Doctor Who novels, I have found that Mr. Dicks usually does a far better job.  However, 'Catastrophea' is an example of the fact that he can produce some right stinkers.<br />Set during the show's tenth season, the Doctor and Jo are travelling away from the planet Spiridon when the Doctor senses a huge amount of pain.  He materialises the TARDIS to investigate.<br />On the planet Kastopheria, they find native race, the People, are being repressed by human colonists.  The Doctor is mistaken by the humans as revolutionary leader El Llama (and being a revolutionary, he has to have a Spanish sounding name - very lazy writing!) while the People recognise him as a prophesied saviour.<br />As it turns out, the humans are using a drug known as skar to keep the People passive.  But the Doctor soon discovers there is more to skar than the humans understand...<br />I think the main problem with this story is that Mr. Dicks came up with some ideas and wrote the book before thinking it through properly.  It hangs together OK (Mr. Dicks is too professional a writer for it not to), but there are sudden turns of events that just seem so unlikely.<br />For Doctor Who completists only!	2000-11-28

I was annoyed by the names that are employed to conceal the &quot;identities&quot; of the people involved - the Rt. Hon. Treasure Fortune M.P. indeed!  Krihc House near the village of Chirk.

Imagine everyone's surprise when the people running the company turn out to actually be aliens!  Who could possibly have predicted that?<br />In keeping with the spirit of the third Doctor's era, political messages are somewhat ham-fistedly thrust forward, and the whole thing is wrapped up in a quasi-Star Trek storyline that is somewhat out of step with Doctor Who as we know it.<br />With more room to expand upon the contents of his radio play, Mr. Letts makes them more in line with Doctor Who - and possibly this is in part because the radio production was very brash and noisy, so the book seems sedate.<br />If you want to experience 'The Paradise of Death', this book is the way to go.	2000-11-25

The landing is not a good one - the TARDIS is perched precariously on the mountainside, and falls after the travellers disembark.  Trying to climb to a castle they can see above, the Doctor and Jo find the entrance to a confusing series of underground passages, neatly foreshadowing the political maze they will soon find themselves embroiled in.<br />They have landed on the planet Peladon in the far future.

And does the Jack the Ripper chronology fit the facts?<br />In this book, Edward Hanna does a good job with both.<br />The sad part is that he doesn't do it better.  There are no great surprises in this book.  The &quot;true&quot; identity of Jack the Ripper (according to this book) is a fairly well-known one, one of the more publicly known theories, which mean that the theory has been expounded many times.<br />Not bad, but not interesting enough to get too excited about.	2000-11-14

The cases are &quot;secret&quot; because of one reason or another, including the involvement of high profile clients.<br />While the idea is a good one - and has been used before with the several versions of Sherlock Holmes investigating the activities of Jack the Ripper - the execution is sometimes frustrating.  The cases under investigations are resolved in history, and so the &quot;solutions&quot; would have come about without Holmes' involvement (although Donald Thomas writes is such a way as you wouldn't think so).<br />I think that, for me, the main frustration is that Holmes is rarely there for the end, having done his investigations and left it to his clients and/or the authorities to finish the matter.  While it is plainly established in he original Sherlock Holmes stories and novels by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle that Holmes often resolved cases and left the credit to the official police force, somehow these stories make this quite frustrating.<br />However, the way in which Holmes and the investigations themselves are written is certainly good fare for fans of the Great Detective, although you might want to have a case in which he plays an active role in the conclusion handy in case you feel the frustrations I did.	2000-11-14

The TARDIS arrives on an alien world, and Jo heads out into the jungle to seek help.  But little does she realise that the fluid sprayed on her by the plants around the TARDIS has infected her...<br />When the Doctor awakes, he goes out looking for Jo.  He encounters a party of Thals, one of the two intelligent races from the planet Skaro.  They are on this planet, Spiridon, seeking to uncover the plans of their enemies, the other race from Skaro, the Daleks.  The Daleks are amassing an army to plunder the Earth and Draconian empires after the war that the Master is trying to provoke begins.<br />If you are familiar with the first Dalek story, you will find much that is familiar in this one.  However, compared to most Dalek stories ('The Dalek Master Plan' aside), this one is written on a much bigger scale.  It is one of those times when the Daleks truly seem a threat to space faring races, even though they are rather bogged down in this story.<br />Terrance Dicks' adaptation could do with more spark, but given that the characters as portrayed in the original are fairly flat this is possibly no surprise.  A readable version of typical Doctor Who.	2000-11-14

I'm not sure, though, that this destination is any better.<br />This story is full of strange alien races and serious bodily transformations, especially for one of the regulars.  And with any such transformations, the return to normal afterwards is a difficult thing to believe.<br />The society of Nooma also causes me some difficulty.

Many people complain that the original Doctor Who novels are too unlike the TV series upon which they are based.  But even where the novels stray from the TV series' usual fodder, they are normally remaining fairly safely within a standard science fiction/horror genre.  But not Paul Magrs.<br />Mr. Magrs has been compared to the magic realism style of writing, and with good reason.  While many of the occurrences in his books are strange and outrageous, they never seem to be out of place - at least, not within his books.<br />Like his previous Doctor Who novels, this one features the wonderful Iris Wildthyme, a Time Lady from Gallifrey and the self-declared love of the Doctor's life.  Like the Doctor, Iris travels through time and space in a TARDIS, which is stuck in the form of a number 22 bus to Putney Common.   Unlike the Doctor's TARDIS, Iris's is just a little bit smaller on the inside.<br />In this book, Iris and her companion Tom (a young, gay black man, so you know he is exactly the sort of companion who wouldn't be featured in Doctor Who as televised) travel to the 1970s to meet up with the Doctor's third incarnation, still exiled to Earth by the Time Lords.  He is immediately attracted to Iris - not because she is the love of his life, but because she has a working TARDIS.<br />In the meantime, Tom is being sought out by an attractive young man, and not for the reason he hopes!  This young man is one of the &quot;Children of Destiny&quot;, and is seeking to have Tom join their ranks.  But what exactly is the &quot;destiny&quot; of which they are children?<br />If you like your Doctor Who just like on the telly, you should probably avoid this book.  If, on the other hand, you want to see it from a very different and fresh perspective, pick this book (and 'The Scarlet Empress' and 'The Blue Angel') up now!	2000-11-09

This novel is Terrance Dicks' adaptation of the anniversary story.<br />The Doctor is visited by Dr. Tyler, whose cosmic ray research coincides with the vanishment of a game warden, who is seeking help to resolve some mysterious results.  But it turns out that he has somehow captured a blob of anti-matter, which is the bridgehead of an assault on our universe from the universe of anti-matter.<br />Under siege in his nonfunctional TARDIS, the Doctor calls on the Time Lords  for help.  However, they too are under siege and decide that since they can't help the Doctor, he's have to help himself.  And so the Doctor's earlier incarnations arrive to help him.<br />This story is important in Doctor Who's history, as it reveals more of the history of the Doctor's people, the Time Lords.  And it's also quite a lot of fun!<br />One of the unfortunate aspects of the story is that, sadly, William Hartnell was too ill to fully participate in the story.  I'm sure it would have been more enjoyable had he been able to take a larger role, and this adaptation does not increase the Doctor's first incarnation's role in the story.	2000-11-09

At the end of that story, he talks about repairing and testing the TARDIS before haring off around time and space.  The next televised story, 'Carnival of Monsters', appears to take place after this maintenance.<br />David McIntee's novel takes place in the period between the two stories.  The Doctor has repaired the TARDIS and decides to take a safe test flight into Earth's past.  He invites Professor Elizabeth Shaw, who was his assistant at the start of his exile on Earth to Join he and Jo on the flight and they head for a point in history of Liz's choosing - the impact on Earth by a extraterrestrial body at Tunguska in 1908.<br />However, things never go as they were planned, and the Doctor, Liz and Jo end up in Russia in 1916, up to their eyeballs in the intrigue of the court of Tsar Nicholas and the strange influence of Rasputin...<br />An interesting historical, far more successful than Mr. McIntee's own inclusion of the Marquis de Sade in 'The Man in the Velvet Mask'.  The general details around Rasputin's life and death are probably known to many, so it is interesting to see this represented in the Doctor Who format.<br />The best part of the book occurs at the very end of the book, reaffirming the view that &quot;you can't rewrite history; not one line!&quot; in a very dramatic fashion.<br />If you don't like Doctor Who historicals, avoid this one.  But if you are happy with such stories, this one is interesting.	2000-11-09

One of Jon Pertwee's favourite serials, 'Frontier in Space' is here adapted by its original author, Malcolm Hulke.<br />This story is an old fashion space opera, something not common in Doctor Who.

Suddenly, the freighter's crew starts to respond to them as though they are the alien Draconians - and Draconians invade the freighter.

Sadly, Mr. Hulke varies the ending of the story so that the Master doesn't shoot the Doctor - which means that the story doesn't flow easily into the second part.	2000-11-09

They arrive on a ship in 1926, where they are taken as stowaways.  However, it quickly develops that there is something not right here: the ship is terrified by a plesiosaur, events repeat themselves in a predictable loop, and the passengers cannot see strange metal plates in the ship.<br />And then the ship somehow opens up and a giant hand removes the TARDIS...<br />Where this story is better than Mr. Holmes previous efforts are multiple story strands and the excellent interaction of supporting characters.

It is adapted by its original author, Malcolm Hulke.<br />The Doctor and Jo visit the Master in his island prison, where he is given every luxury except his freedom.  But there is something going on out to sea.  Three ships have gone down with all hands in the recent past, and the Doctor takes it upon himself to investigate.<br />What undersea menace is at work?  And how is the Master involved?<br />The eponymous race of this story have the misfortune of appearing in a story with the Master, and are largely relegated to the role of being &quot;the muscle&quot;.  This is unfortunate, as it has set the tone for all subsequent appearances.  (The Sea Devils' &quot;cousins&quot;, the Silurians got to hold the spotlight in their first showing and have held it ever since!)<br />The novel itself has the distinct advantage over the video in that the original TV serial was overlong, and the novel avoids spending too much time on running around.  However, the straightforward adaptation of this story compares unfavourably with Mr. Hulke's adaptation of 'The Silurians'.  There are also illustrations of a fairly poor quality.	2000-11-07

As with the others, she sets out to relate the otherwise untold investigations of the Great Detective, as mentioned in passing in the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br />In choosing to write these &quot;untold stories&quot;, there is a problem: there are so many people telling them!  I have, in the last two weeks, read three different versions of the story of the repulsive red leech, of which the world was not ready to hear.  In many respects, authors who write completely new stories are (perhaps!) Doing the readers a favour.<br />Having said that, many of the attempts can be patchy, and so it is often good to relax with an author of known quality and see what she has to say on these.<br />The stories presented here don't particularly push the boundaries of the Holmesian experience, but are certainly on par with many of the works of  Doyle, so readers seeking a &quot;true&quot; recreation of Sherlock Holmes will be satisfied.  But, with those boundaries unpushed, and with the sheer quantity of Sherlock Holmes stories to read, I'm afraid that this book doesn't rise above three stars for me.	2000-11-07

Some elements from that novel carry through to this, and on their way collect a variety of other elements from the Doctor's past.<br />Faced with the problem of the Master's escape from imprisonment, the Brigadier seeks the assistance of a rising star of the scientific community: Ian Chesterton, formerly a companion of the Doctor (in his first incarnation), and Chesterton's wife, Barbara, is also drawn into the affair.<br />But it is not just the Master at work here, and the Brigadier and the Chestertons are faced with the dilemma of which is the greater evil: the Master or (can't be revealed here!)...<br />There have been very few attempts to spin the supporting cast of Doctor Who off into their own stories - probably the best known is the pilot episode of 'K9 and Company', featuring K9 and (arguably) the Doctor's best ever companion, Sarah Jane Smith.  A few other book also exist: Harry Sullivan and Turlough each have one; Ace and Benny had a largely Doctorless outing in 'Birthright' - and the aforementioned Professor Summerfield features in books and audios in her own right; the Brigadier, Sarah and Victoria all feature prominently in 'Downtime' (based  on a fan-produced direct-to-video release of the same name); and Liz Shaw starred in a 4 volume fan-produced direct-to-video series called PROBE.<br />With the very rich background that Doctor Who provides, it is a great pity there isn't more books like this.

Add to this imaginary occurrences and dreams that slip unannounced into the intertwining narratives and you'll probably appreciate that I'm not going to try to describe any storyline - the storyline you interpret for yourself is probably the best one for you.<br />Mr. Ware's illustrative style is clear, clean and detailed.  He also imbues each scene with emotional content, whether from variations in colouring, a slightly different depiction of a person or place to suit the particular Corrigan's own emotions at the time, or techniques like the size of individual panels and combining panels in sequence.<br />This book is more an emotional than intellectual journey.

And now it is time to reveal the truth about Sherlock Holmes and the man who was known as Jack the Ripper...<br />But, the legacy of the Ripper lives on, and will stop at nothing to prevent the truth getting out.<br />Fairly well-written, the story doesn't contain too many twists and turns that can't be predicted, but exactly what tack a particular author would take with this kind of story isn't predictable.

It is adapted by Doctor Who's script editor of the time, Terrance Dicks.<br />In many respects, 'The Claws of Axos' is an archetypal third Doctor and UNIT story.  It contains all the classic elements: a possible threat which turns out to be more than meets the eye, officials who cause more harm than good due to their own self-importance, the stalwarts UNIT troops disarmed by the regular army, and the Doctor several steps ahead of everyone.<br />The substantial difference from this standard story is that the aliens, the Axons, offer humanity a gift - the miracle element, Axonite, which could help solve humanity's problems.<br />Not bad, but also not particularly good.  Possibly more enjoyable as a video.	2000-11-02

It returns, but when recovered has no crew whatsoever, and is highly radioactive.  UNIT is called in to try to discover what has happened.<br />It turns out that someone has kidnapped the ambassadors of an alien race.  If they are not returned, Earth faces destruction...<br />'The Ambassadors of Death' was overly-long as a TV serial.  Terrance Dicks takes the opportunity to present us with a slimmer version of the story - not necessarily lacking in detail, but seemingly faster-paced.  This is probably an illusion, but one which readers should take graciously.<br />This story explores Doctor Who's new 'exiled on Earth' format, and does so quite sensibly by reversing the usual roles of humans and aliens.	2000-11-02

He takes up both issues with the Brigadier.<br />As if the threat of the return of the Autons is not enough, the Doctor is warned by the Time Lords that they are in league with another renegade Time Lord, the Master...<br />Doctor Who's eighth season  introduced a new opponent: the Master, another Time Lord, who featured in every story of the season and has been a regular ever since.  The first story also introduced a new companion for the Doctor, Jo Grant, fleshed out the ranks of UNIT with the addition of Captain Mike Yates, and saw the return of the Autons from the previous season.<br />The story works better as a TV serial than a novel, but it is still a good adaptation by Terrance Dicks.  The illustrations aren't too good, with limited resemblance to the regulars and the other characters looking nothing like the actors who played them on TV.<br />(For those who want to know more about the Master: try to get a copy of 'The Dark Path', which was written to reveal what it was that made an old friend of the Doctor become so evil.)	2000-11-02

But don't judge a book by its title.<br />An alien object breaks up when entering Earth's atmosphere, and you know that means we're in for alien visitors.  The matter is duly reported to the Doctor, but he is having problems of his own.  Someone is trying to kidnap him...<br />This story contains some globe-spanning intrigue as well as a new menace from beyond Earth (from Triton, one of the moons of Neptune, to be precise - the hokey name had to come from somewhere...), and, following on from the more &quot;adult&quot; tone of season seven, UNIT is not the happy family you might have expected from season eight.<br />A decent read, with quite a few plot twists which may surprise you.	2000-11-02

All this and to pit the Doctor against the Silurians once more.<br />The disappearance of a young boy ties in with a policewoman making cave paintings - a sign that an encounter with the Silurians have raised deeply-buried racial memories.  The Doctor finds his closest allies distracted by personal matters, and must investigate largely on his own.<br />Mr. Russell tries to fit too much into the one book.  While much of it is fairly well handled, it results in a disjointed read.  The continuity holes in 'Warriors of the Deep' aren't that important that a book such as this needed to be written to fix them.<br />Probably Liz Shaw and her reasons for leaving UNIT are the best part of the book.	2000-11-02

He and Liz Shaw are summoned by the Brigadier to Wenley Moor, where strange things are happening at a nuclear research station.  There are mysterious power losses, nervous breakdowns, and UNIT's assistance is sought after one scientist is killed and his pot holing companion goes mad.<br />There is something in the caves under Wenley Moor, and it is not friendly...<br />One of the earliest Target novelisations, author Malcolm Hulke obviously takes a fairly free hand in retelling this story.  It is a recognition that what works well on TV won't necessarily work well in a book.  This book is not simply an adaptation, but a reworking of the story for a different medium.	2000-11-02

One of several novels set after the TV serial 'Inferno', and featuring Liz Shaw as the third Doctor's companion, 'Eye of the Giant' is essentially a B-grade sci fi movie plot in a Doctor Who story.<br />An alien artifact is found in the stomach of a shark, and brought to UNIT's London HQ for investigation.  The Doctor uses his space-time visualiser to find out where it came from, but strange radiation results in a crossable bridge to an island in 1934, where a small movie crew are at work.<br />An alien ship has crashed on the island, and its contents will effect the future of Earth...<br />As well as featuring the under-appreciated Liz Shaw, this novel is also used as an introduction to UNIT regular Mike Yates, here holding the rank of sergeant.  As well as spending some time exploring the characters, the novel also looks at another under-used Doctor Who item: whether actions carried out in the past can result in changes to the present.  And not a very pretty set of consequences are on display...<br />Christopher Bulis is generally a good author, but I would have been happier if his 1930s characters were less reliant on established clichés.	2000-11-02

Based on the TV serial 'Colony in Space', Malcolm Hulke adapts his own story, which features the first trip of the third Doctor and Jo in the TARDIS.<br />Showing Jo the TARDIS interior, the ship suddenly takes off without any actions from the Doctor and the pair are deposited on an alien planet 1000 years in the future.  They are captured by colonists, who believe they are working for the IMC, a mining company who wants to exploit the minerals of their planet.  Amongst conflict between the two groups of humans, and the possible threat of the Primitives of the world, a Earth Adjudicator arrives to settle the problems.  But he is, in fact, the Master...<br />For the first trip into space in two years, this story is actually very dull, making the Earth-based ones seem much better by comparison.  It is quite drawn out, taking a while to get to the point, with several spurious conflicts that seem to exist simply to string out the book.<br />The illustrations are OK, but not great.<br />This novel was one of the first published by Target, and somewhat spuriously adds the meeting between the Doctor and Jo to the beginning of the book.  If you were reading the novelisations in order, this would be your second encounter with this seen, the previous one being three books before!	2000-11-02

(I say arguably, since 'The Trial of a Time Lord' went for 14 episodes, but had a number of sub-stories.)<br />This novel is the adaptation of the prologue and first six episodes.  It is written as a &quot;stand alone&quot; book, and could be read separately from the second part ('The Mutation of Time') if you really wanted and couldn't find the second part.  (It is certainly a better tactic than trying to cram so much information into a single volume - witness the adaptation of 'The War Games' for a different way of adapting a long story.)<br />In essence, the Daleks and a number of other alien races form an alliance to invade human space (or the Solar System, as the story oddly refers to it).  They have constructed a secret weapon which requires a Tarranium core to power it.  The Doctor, with companions Steven and Katarina arrive on the planet Kembal and stumble into the investigation of Space Security Service agent Bret Vyon.<br />Little do any of them know, but there is a traitor in the hierarchy of the human government.<br />Possibly the main fault of this story is that it is a little meandering - not as bad as, say, 'The Keys of Marinus' and 'The Chase', but containing some things that could have been left out in the original.  John Peel, however, correctly retains them in this adaptation.<br />What Mr. Peel does do is insert a wide variety of references to the universe of Doctor Who that, in 1965 when this story was shown, hadn't yet been thought of.  By doing so, he adds to the text.  It is also interesting to see how he layers the prologue into rest of the story.<br />As such, this novelisation not only stands in for the original story (most of which no longer exists on tape), but is probably a more enjoyable read for Doctor Who fans than a straightforward adaptation would have been.	2000-10-27

The TARDIS arrives on a space station, and the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are separated from their ship when the station is split apart.  Inevitably they get caught up in this trivial tale of claim jumping and political struggle for the control of a mining company.<br />Read it if you are a completist.  Avoid it otherwise.	2000-10-27

The original story ran for ten episodes, and replaced two scripts that fell through.  I think that many viewers thought it was a bit padded.  The novel confirms this, as the page count is about that of a four or six episode story adaptation.<br />The TARDIS lands in what appears to be World War I.  However, as they endeavour to avoid capture they see a number of things that are anachronistic, but invisible to the inhabitants of  the world, and the fact that something is very wrong when, after passing through a fog bank and encounter Roman soldiers.<br />Some alien force has kidnapped soldiers from various wars on Earth, and are conducting war games for a reason that is revealed late in the story.<br />At the climax of the story, some of the Doctor's past is revealed - more than had been the case to this point.  And the resolution of the story requires that the Doctor change his form again...<br />In adapting this story, Mr. Hulke wisely trims the early-middle of the story, where things contained a bit of a run around.  It is an important story, and this adaptation preserves the most important parts for the reader.	2000-10-27

These delicate, dolphin-like water-breathers wear powered armour decorated to make them look like sharks, and have a code of honour that prevents them from any substantial friendly interaction with other races.<br />'The Final Sanction' depicts a war between humanity and the Selachians, into which the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe stumble.  Recognising the period they are in, the Doctor tries to take his companions away from this time but the TARDIS has vanished.<br />When Zoe is captured by the Selachians, the Doctor is faced with a dilemma: to save her, he must risk disrupting the true course of history.  Will the Doctor risk disruption of the timestream or will he leave Zoe to a gruesome fate?<br />By taking a new look at this fascinating race, especially what their lives are like when not engaged in battle, and bringing into doubt one of the strongest tenets of the series, Mr. Lyons gives us a novel that is well worth reading.	2000-10-27

I also enjoyed it as a book, and even Terrance Dicks seems to have been inspired to put a little more effort in than is common for him at this time in his writing of Doctor Who novels.<br />Arriving on Earth in the Twenty-first Century, the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe are soon caught up in a crisis involving the Earth's only method of distance travel - Travelmat (or T-mat) is having problems at its relay point on the Moon, and the Earth authorities are obliged to send a rocket to the Moon to investigate.  Given the lack of suitable people with requisite experience, the TARDIS crew volunteer.<br />But the lunar base has been taken over by an old foe, the Ice Warriors...<br />Depicting an Earth which has become unduly reliant on a single form of technology, this story depicts those who can think outside the normal boundaries as the only truly successful people.  It is in this climate of mental stagnation that the Doctor is shown at his best.<br />As well as this societal commentary, the story features a number of claustrophobic settings which add to the tension of the story, and the lumbering menace of the Ice Warriors is again palpable.<br />This story survives in its original from and has been released on video.  The novel succeeds over the original in that the TV serial tends to be quite slow moving at times, but the video wins out in the portrayal of the Ice Warriors.  Enjoy either or both for their strengths!	2000-10-27

Probably the second best Cybermen story ever made (beaten by 'Tomb of the Cybermen' and only rivaled by 'Earthshock').  This novelisation has the benefit of an increased page- and word-count.<br />The TARDIS arrives on contemporary Earth with a problem, so the Doctor decides to enlist the aid of friend Professor Travers in repairing it.  They quickly get drawn into what appears to be some kind of commercial espionage, but turns out to be an official investigation of the activities of the company, International Electromatics.<br />The story is notable for the introduction of Doctor Who's mainstay organisation, UNIT, and features the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.  The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe assist UNIT in their investigation and infiltration of IE.  But they soon encounter their old enemies, the Cybermen.<br />The only problem with this story is the Cybermen: they are essentially a nondescript opponent.  It is their human ally, Tobias Vaughn, who is the real villain of the piece.<br />While it isn't complete (two of the eight episodes have been lost), watching the video is preferable to reading the book as Kevin Stoney's portrayal of Tobias Vaughn really makes the story, adding to great performances by the regulars.	2000-10-27

In the novel, the TARDIS crew are present at the eruption of Mount Vesuvius (an era far better explored in the audio play 'Fires of Vulcan').  Using an emergency unit that pushes the TARDIS out of reality, the travellers find themselves in a white void where something tries to lure them out...<br />They find themselves in a strange land, populated by characters from myth and literature.  And the ruler of this land has plans for the Doctor.<br />While the story is OK in this novelised form, the original story is so striking that this effort pales in comparison.

'The Dominators' is the first story of Patrick Troughton's last year playing the Doctor.  It is adapted as a novel by Ian Marter.  Like the TV serial upon which it is based, the book has a problem: it is not very interesting!<br />The TARDIS brings the Doctor, Jamie and new companion Zoe to the planet Dulkis.  The Dulcians are a peaceful race, having eliminated war.  They are also very slow in making decisions and find it hard to believe anything out of their normal sphere of knowledge.  So the arrival of a pair of warlike Dominators and their robots, the Quarks, is generally disbelieved by the rulers of the planet.  This allows the Dominators' plan to progress, with limited opposition from the TARDIS crew and some Dulcians...<br />Unfortunately, the Dominators, Quarks and Dulcians are all pretty one-dimensional.  Mr. Marter tries his best, and inserts a number of small items into the novel to prevent it from being dry as dust.  But there is only so far he can raise this story from its very pedestrian plot.	2000-10-22

The crews of some gas rigs have vanished, and the operations of refinery have been subject to odd changes in gas pressure within the pipes.<br />What is it lurking in the refinery's pipes?<br />This is one of many stories of which the BBC no longer has a copy.  They released the soundtrack on audio cassette some years back, and it is likely to be re-released on CD sometime in the future.  Some clips of the series can be found on 'The Missing Years' video, released in conjunction with 'The Ice Warriors'.<br />While Mr. Pemberton's novelisation is quite good, and benefits from its higher than normal page count, watching the few remaining clips only emphasises what has been lost.

Adapted by the prolific Terrance Dicks, his work in this case is extremely straightforward and unlikely to inspire much additional good feeling for this relatively slow-paced and quite predictable story.<br />The Doctor and Jamie arrive inside a rocket, where they encounter a hostile servo-robot.  With the TARDIS out of action, the two are forced to complete the rocket's journey to an enormous space station (the eponymous wheel in space) where they assist the crew against the steadily unfolding plans of the Cybermen.<br />The story is full of coincidences (for instance, the Doctor disconnects a TARDIS component, which they bring with them, which fortuitously makes a handy weapon and tool) and generally shows signs of lazy plotting.  These are not the fault of Mr. Dicks, although the text might possibly have helped to conceal some of these had he made a stronger attempt.	2000-10-22

Whereas the original visit to the planet Vortis had no real connection to the overall Doctor Who universe, Christopher Bulis decides for some reason to change it from a strange and distant world to just another bunch of aliens being invaded by humans.<br />In endeavouring to recapture the questionable magic of the original without simply rehashing it, we are presented instead with a wandering planet and the offspring of the original menace, the Animus.  Even the original foot soldiers of the enemy, the Zarbi, whom the BBC once hoped would become as popular as the Daleks, have no substantial part to play in the story.  Indeed, the appearance of one on the cover is probably the most noticeable contribution they make to the story.<br />Sequels are hard.

Neither 'The Burning' nor 'Casualties of War' have particularly satisfied me as they haven't convinced me that anything has changed.  The Doctor has lost his memory, but apart from a few references to this it appears to have had no impact on the story.  I was therefore delighted when finally I got the impression that something was very different in 'The Turing Test'.<br />Paul Leonard writes this story from three perspectives, those of real people alive at the time and still well known today: mathematician and code breaker Alan Turing, and novelists Graham Greene and Joseph Heller.<br />The Doctor is alive and well on Earth, and is trying to work out exactly who he is.  In this quest, he encounters the three &quot;authors&quot; of the story who assist him, in one way or another and with different degrees of willingness, to track down some people who are also very different from other people.<br />The story is entertaining on a variety of levels.  It is a fairly straightforward adventure story (although the backtracking inherent in the changing of &quot;authors&quot; might frustrate some).  It is also a different Doctor, one who is operating with a very personal agenda which is at odds with his normal methods.  It is also about what makes people &quot;human&quot; (in a very broad sense), and we are given a variety of examples both within the human cast and also with those who are not truly human.<br />I hope that the rest of the story arc is up to the standard this novel has set.	2000-10-21

The stories that depart from this formula (like 'The Highlanders', 'Enemy of the World' and 'The Space Pirates') are usually quite forgettable - with the obvious exception of 'The Mind Robber'.  Why Justin Richards chose to stray so far from the essence of the second Doctor in this novel is a bit of a mystery.<br />Arriving in what appears to be a medieval castle, but is actually a prison in space, the Doctor, Jamie and Victoria are caught up in a series of political intrigues around the future of a space empire.<br />With elements of 'The Man in the Iron Mask' mixed liberally with visual descriptions of what would have been slapstick comedy if presented visually, the novel is interesting enough but seems overly obsessed with the comic elements that were only one factor in Troughton's stories.  Dealing with the future of empires really wasn't this incarnation's interest, and I'm afraid that Jamie and Victoria are probably among the last companions you'd want in such a story - both should have been more out of their depth.	2000-10-21

Travers is working with a group of soldiers, trying to defeat the Intelligence, but little do they realise that one of them is an agent of the Intelligence.<br />This story is very important to the history of Doctor Who.

Released fairly early on in the range of Target novelisations, it remains one of the freshest.<br />The TARDIS materialises in England during a future Ice Age.  Humanity is fighting to prevent its own glacial destruction by the use of the Ioniser, a number of which are positioned strategically around the world.  The Doctor, Jamie and Victoria arrive in the middle of a crisis, and the Doctor is able to provide advice which brings the Ioniser back from the brink of disaster, and is pressed into service to replace the base's missing chief scientist, Penley.<br />Meanwhile, one of the base scientists finds a warrior frozen in the ice, but close to the surface due to the operation of the Ioniser.  He brings it back to the base as an archaeological find, and sets about melting the ice coating.  But little are the inhabitants aware that this warrior is from Mars, and not dead but simply in suspended animation...<br />The story is full of strong images, with scenes set within base, the Martian spaceship and the glacier itself.  The characters have strong motivations, and many have far too much pride to allow any compromises to be reached.  Mr.. Hayles' descriptions evoke memories of the series from when I first saw it as a child.<br />This story is also available on an incomplete video release from BBC (with the two missing episodes partially reconstructed by use of some of their soundtracks and stills in an interesting format).	2000-10-21

This is Ian Marter's adaptation of one of the true oddities of Patrick Troughton's period playing the Doctor.  While I generally enjoy Mr. Marter's novelisations, he got stuck with a real stinker here.<br />Set in 2030, it deals with the political manipulations of Salamander, who just happens to be an exact replica of the Doctor.  By creating a series of &quot;natural&quot; disasters, he is hoping to increase his current high popularity by assisting the survivors.  But not everyone is convinced, and when those opposed to Salamander encounter the Doctor and learn that he is not the villain, they enlist him in an elaborate infiltration plot.<br />By all accounts, Patrick Troughton did a great job playing both the Doctor and Salamander.  However, in this novel, we don't get the benefit of the late Mr. Troughton's acting skills.  We also have to overcome the obvious problems in believing that a young man from the 1740s and a young woman from the 1860s can convincingly play the roles of espionage agents in 2030.<br />Even without these problems, there is still the big issue that the story is really lightweight.  Someone should have thought twice before allowing this pallid attempt at a James Bond story to have been made.<br />Uninspiring.  For Doctor Who completists only!	2000-10-21

It is written by Terrance Dicks, the most prolific of adapters, and being one of his first his prose style is more dynamic than his later adaptations.<br />The TARDIS arrives in the Himalayas, and the Doctor is excited by the opportunity to return the holy ghanta, a bell he has in safe keeping for the Det-sen Monastery.  Leaving Jamie and Victoria in the TARDIS, he sets off to return the bell, promising to return to bring them once their welcome is ensured.  When he arrives at the monastery, he finds that the yeti have become hostile and British explorer Edward Travers convinces the monks that the Doctor is behind this.<br />Meanwhile, Jamie and Victoria get bored waiting in the TARDIS and head out to explore.  They find a cave with a pyramid built of silver spheres before being trapped by a yeti...<br />The story has several twists and turns, with both the nature of the yeti and their master not being what they at first appear.  It is both excellent and original, but the broadcast version is now lost (except for one episode of the original six).  This novel is the best way to enjoy this great piece of Doctor Who history.	2000-10-20

Inevitably they find themselves drawn into events around a plan to rescue King Charles from prison.<br />In this book, Mark Gatiss takes the opportunity to explore the characters, especially Ben and Polly.  Ben was established as a sailor in his first appearance, but this book is his first real opportunity to demonstrate his nautical skills after he is pressganged into serving on a ship.  Polly gets romantically entangled with a Royalist conspirator, although she doesn't learn this at first.  And the Doctor and Jamie are imprisoned in the Tower of London (being Scottish, Jamie's supposed allegiances make him an enemy of the Lord Protector).<br />Mark Gatiss is a good writer.  He paces things well, and understands foreshadowing.  He is also fairly humorous (as one would hope, based on 'The League of Gentlemen' TV series which he is one of the writer/actors in) but not overbearingly so.<br />Even if you are not a fan of the Doctor's historical adventures, you may still enjoy this one.	2000-10-20

Not only is it, perhaps, the archetypal second Doctor story, but 'The Tomb of the Cybermen' is the first thing I remember watching on TV.  Scared me enormously at the time!<br />The TARDIS arrives on the planet Telos where the Doctor, Jamie and Victoria meet with an archaeological expedition.  The archaeologists are on Telos to dig up the last remains of the Cybermen, and the Doctor refuses to leave because of them. <br />Despite being called 'The Tomb of the Cybermen', the silver giants are not dead but merely frozen.  Some members of the expedition are not interested in a scientific discoveries but in using the power of the Cybermen to conquer Earth.<br />The adaptation is good, and better than many.  Mr. Davis sticks to the original story and uses a larger word count than most novelisations to tell it.  While it is still possible to see the original serial on video, you get the additional bonus of not having to see how poorly 1967 special effects have aged.	2000-10-20

At  the time the story was broadcast, back in 1967, it was intended to be the last ever Dalek serial in Doctor Who (Terry Nation had hoped to have a standalone Dalek series produced in America).<br />Like 'The Power of the Daleks', this adaptation is by John Peel and benefits from a larger page count than the general run of Target adaptations.  This allows Mr.. Peel to explore the motivations of the different characters, which increases the enjoyment of the read.<br />Following on directly from 'The Faceless Ones', the TARDIS has been stolen by persons unknown from Gatwick Airport.  Following leads which the Doctor believes were deliberately left for them, he and Jamie end up at an antique store run by Edward Waterfield.  The antiques at this shop appear to be both authentic and brand-new.<br />As it turns out, Waterfield is an agent for the Daleks and he takes the Doctor and Jamie back to the 1860s, his own time, where the Daleks force the Doctor to conduct experiments on Jamie to discover the Human Factor, which they believe is what has allowed the humans to defeat them in the past.<br />The climax of this story occurs on the Daleks' home planet, Skaro, and introduces the Emperor Dalek, the ruler of the Dalek race and its empire.<br />A decent size adaptation which allows the reader the opportunity to sink their teeth into a juicy story, which includes a few twists and turns which may take those who don't know the storyline a few surprises.	2000-10-20

Some travellers with Chameleon Tours have travelled overseas but have not come back.  Families are reassured by postcards describing events of their holidays.  But these postcards are fakes...<br />After Polly mysteriously vanishes, someone who looks like her turns up working at the Chameleon Tours desk.  But she says she isn't Polly...<br />This story of alien abduction and substitution has something of an X-Files feel, except that the authorities aren't an active participant in the aliens' plans.  It is sadly the last story for Ben and Polly, who are essentially written out part way through the book and return at the end to make their farewells.<br />Like many of Terrance Dicks' adaptations, it is readable but lacks any particular inspiration in its writing.	2000-10-20

And not a bad story, as it turns out.<br />The TARDIS arrives in the &quot;far future&quot; on a colony world, which seems based on the concept of English holiday camps.  The fact that they meet one of the colonists, who claims that the colony is being invaded by monsters, before he is imprisoned for medical treatment casts some doubt on the claims that everything is just peachy keen.<br />The activities of the invaders are more invidious than many in the series, and the enforced cheerfulness of the colony mean that the travellers have a hard time convincing people that the monsters do exist.  Especially after Ben falls under the influence of the invaders...<br />While this adaptation is quite solid, what is lacking is the atmosphere of the colony.  The BBC have long since destroyed the original TV serial, but its sound track has been released on both cassette and CD.  For my money, the audio version is better than this adaptation.	2000-10-20

A number of stories vie for the unenviable position of the worst Doctor Who story ever made.  This is one of them.<br />'The Underwater Menace' is a tale of unbelievable science being practiced by a truly insane megalomaniac (his plan must result in his own death) in an unlikely setting.<br />The TARDIS arrives on a desert island, and its crew are captured one by one.  They find themselves prisoners in the lost kingdom of Atlantis.  The Atlanteans are being aided by Professor Zaroff in their plan to raise the island back to the surface.  But there is more to Zaroff's plans than even the Atlanteans know...<br />About the only thing we are spared is the over the top acting of Joseph Furst as Professor Zaroff in this fairly straightforward adaptation of a Doctor Who series that should never have been made.

Doctor Who was in the process of reinventing itself: a new Doctor was in place and this story saw two further significant changes.  It is the last of the truly historical stories, and it introduces Jamie, one of the Doctor's most popular travelling companions.<br />Set just after the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the Doctor, Ben and Polly emerge from the TARDIS and encounter a small group of highlanders escaping from their defeat at Culloden.  The obviously English accents of the TARDIS crew result in conflict, which escalates when English soldiers arrive.<br />This story is one of  trust and betrayal.  The TARDIS crew are all fairly well-served by this story, but some of the Doctor's antics (adopting numerous disguises) seem quite light compared to the story's serious tone.<br />Gerry Davis was the script editor at the time this show was made, and produces a straightforward adaptation.  Like many such, we don't get into the character's heads too much.<br />As a (more or less) straight historical, casual science fiction readers should probably leave whatever copies of this book can be found to Doctor Who enthusiasts.<br />The original tapes of this story have been destroyed, but the soundtrack has recently been released by BBC.

Not only does it introduce one of the Doctor's most popular foes, the Cybermen, but it also introduces the concept of regeneration, and important factor in the series longevity.  It is adapted by one of the co-authors of the original script, Gerry Davis.<br />The TARDIS arrives on Earth in the year 2000 (a departure from the original script, where it was set in 1986!) at the Antarctic.  They are captured by troops from the nearby space base, Snowcap, where a space flight which is being monitored is off course for no apparent reason.  And then the reason is sighted: a new planet, a duplicate of Earth, is seen in space...<br />Mondas is inhabited by the Cybermen, once human who have replaced their limbs by plastic and steel, and their brains by computers.  (A handy guide to the creation of the Cybermen appears before the story starts.)  They are seeking to invade Earth for reasons that become plain towards the end of the book.<br />The book isn't bad.  It is archetypal B-grade science fiction, much like many of the stories in the second Doctor's era,  but as long as you aren't expecting highly original science fiction you'll be fine.	2000-10-18

It is intended to link all computers in the world are linked via WOTAN (which means the Internet would have been invented in 1966!).  However, it turns out that WOTAN has plans of its own...<br />The first televised Doctor Who story to be set in its entirety on contemporary Earth, the story is essentially the template for many future stories - particularly the beginning of the Third (Jon Pertwee) Doctor's era.<br />It also sees substantial changes to the TARDIS crew.  Dodo is back on Earth in her own time, and is obliged to leave during the course of the story.  More importantly, new companions Ben and Polly are introduced.  They don't follow the templates set by original companions Ian and Susan, and represent a new kind of companion who would be generally replicated over the next five years.<br />Those are the good points.  The story itself is not very original, and the adaptation is quite straightforward.  Worth a read (or a watch, the video is available) for Doctor Who fans, but probably enjoyable to more casual readers as well.	2000-10-18

Originally a luxury hotel, it has fallen on hard times and is being used to host a murder mystery hotel.  However, someone is taking the &quot;murder&quot; aspect of the game far too seriously...<br />Waiting in the wings are the Selachians, an alien race with a serious axe to grind after years of persecution, who are after something in the hotel which will help them revenge their mistreatment.  They are quite complex, rather than being simple killing machines that many alien races are depicted as in Doctor Who.<br />The novel features good portrayals of Ben and Polly, who show stronger feelings for each other than have otherwise been portrayed.  This doesn't surprise me, as they more-or-less flirted with each other at various points.<br />While the story is not as complex as many Doctor Who novels, however this suits the period of the show in which this story is set.  It doesn't require familiarity with the show to be enjoyed.	2000-10-18

Possibly the most important of these was the first story of the second Doctor (as portrayed by Patrick Troughton).  Whereas 'The Tenth Planet' introduced the concept of regeneration, 'The Power of the Daleks' had to make it work.<br />In this adaptation, John Peel is fortunate to have a decent page count in which to portray the story.  Unlike the vast majority of Doctor Who novelisations, this one has the time to examine the motives of the characters rather than just describing their actions.<br />The Doctor and his companions, Ben and Polly, arrive on the Earth colony of Vulcan.  While Polly accepts that the man claiming to be the Doctor is indeed him, but Ben is more sceptical.  Following some arguments, the Doctor exits the TARDIS and straight into the assassination of an Earth official, for whom the Doctor will be taken to be.<br />Explorations by the colony have uncovered a buried spaceship, and with the Doctor's assistance it is opened and inside is a Dalek...<br />This story is also important in the history of depiction of the Daleks.  In all previous stories, they have been in control.  In this story, they are vastly outnumbered by the humans and lack resources to aid them.  But these are Daleks, so they find a way to bring themselves to a position to fight the humans.<br />The Doctor's endeavours are greatly impeded by internal politics of the colony.<br />If only all the Target novelisations had been given this amount of space and thought in their adaptation!	2000-10-18

(They can accept the TARDIS is bigger on the inside, but not travelling in time?)  They become caught up with some pirates, who are searching for buried treasure.<br />Probably this story would have benefited from a less traditional adaptation.  It tells the story well enough, but lacks any real spark.  It also fails in the original mission for Doctor Who historicals, which was to educate the viewers.

While the story still exists in its original form, the BBC have not released it on video so I cannot say whether the reputation is earned or not.<br />The novelisation is one which features a fun romp through the events leading up to the gunfight at the OK Corral.  The Doctor has a toothache, and they seek the services of a dentist - and the dentist in Tombstone is Doc Holliday.  Through the connivance of Doc, the TARDIS crew (and the Doctor in particular) find themselves in a difficult situation.<br />This story features a fair degree of comedy, although it is not as forced as was the case in, say.

Dodo Chaplet is perhaps the companion of the Doctor most in need of fleshing out.  We really didn't get introduced to her (she just stumbled into the TARDIS in the final minutes of 'The Massacre') and we never really saw her go (she was bundled off to the country, never to return, halfway through 'The War Machines').  Given that she is a cut-down version of Vicki (who was herself a cut-down version of Susan), she needs some attention.<br />Recognising that Dodo seemed entirely at home in the TARDIS in 'The Ark' (simply disbelieving that it could travel through time), Steve Lyons undertakes a story which establishes Dodo as part of the TARDIS crew and sees some travel in space (from England to America) that still allows her scepticism to be in place.<br />'Salvation' is a story about mysterious beings, claiming to be gods, arriving on Earth and setting themselves up as a modern-day pantheon.  They are Max, the God of Materialism; Norman, the God of Order; Jennifer, the Goddess of Free Love; Dennis, the God of War; and their leader, the Patriarch.  And some amusement they caused me (gods named Norman and Dennis?  Much chuckling.)<br />The theme of the story is largely the need to believe, and what people will do for their beliefs - and to those who have different beliefs.  But it also remains a human story, even with its larger focus.<br />Mr Lyons is far kinder in his approach to Dodo than some other authors have been (see 'The Man in the Velvet Mask' and 'Who Killed Kennedy?'), but I really wonder why authors are so obsessed with giving Dodo a sex life.	2000-10-17

Back in the early days of the show, this certainly wasn't the case - the TARDIS was a means of getting there, and time travelling essentially occurred between stories.  Not so with 'The Ark'.<br />In his straightforward adaptation of his own script, Paul Erickson brings us a story where the TARDIS arrives on a spaceship and explores, but gets into trouble when Dodo accidentally infects the crew with the common cold, a disease so long eradicated that they have no immunity to it.<br />While the Doctor saves the day by inventing a cure, the TARDIS crew then journey on and arrive 700 years in the future to see the consequences of their actions.<br />This story features an alien race called the Monoids, who are initially depicted as working in a subservient fashion with the humans.  (There is some claims that they are partners, but it is plain that it is the humans who are in charge here.)<br />What sets this story apart from the majority of Doctor Who is that it looks at the impact of the TARDIS crew on the lives of groups of people.  It is, perhaps, unfortunate that it is done in such a heavy handed way, although it would probably have been much harder to have produced a story based on a more subtle impact when the original version was broadcast back in 1966.	2000-10-17

Ace, in exploring the TARDIS, turns up an item acquired by the second Doctor, which the current incarnation decides he should have left in place.  The TARDIS takes the two back to the space station from which the item originated, and headlong into adventure.<br />This book is written by Peter Darvill-Evans, who had been the editor for the Doctor Who line of books published by Virgin.  Ace is much more independent than she is sometimes portrayed, and in fact the two are separated for much of the book.  As the story progresses, one or the other is dominating proceedings.<br />What I found particularly good is the examination of the impact of the Doctor on the people he is helping.  Their position is so low that they find his actions miraculous, and he is fairly quickly cast in the role of a messiah.  While this is not too far away from the way some people follow the Doctor, I don't recall it having been explored to the same extent as in this book.  The Doctor finds his choices constrained by the sheer number of people directly relying upon him, and some of the things he would have preferred to do (like finding Ace) must be put on hold as he deals with the urgent needs of those who are his followers.<br />'Independence Day' is a welcome change from the dominance of Mike Tucker (with and without Robert Perry) in producing seventh Doctor and Ace books - not because Mr Tucker does it badly (quite the opposite) but sometimes a different view is refreshing.	2000-10-17

Sadly, the Toymaker is really the only worthwhile element in this story.<br />The story features the TARDIS crew, captured by the Toymaker, and forced to play against the Toymaker and his servants in a series of games.  If they lose, they will become the Toymaker's playthings.<br />The games are largely English school games and while this may have worked on-screen, the description of them is pretty unengaging.  Unfortunately, most of this story no longer exists in its original form (and the one episode I have seen is pretty boring, too) so this may be the only way to enjoy this story.<br />The Toymaker has been popular enough to return (in written form) a couple of times: you might want to read 'Nightmare Fair' or 'Divided Loyalties' to see him in a better story.	2000-10-17

Donald Cotton's adaptation of his own script is very much not a straightforward adaptation.<br />This book is narrated by the Greek poet Homer - who wrote 'The Iliad', about the siege of Troy.  This book is also about the siege, and it certainly isn't 'The Iliad'!  Homer didn't even appear in the original version of the story.<br />The Doctor, Vicki and Steven arrive towards the end of the siege, and the Doctor, who leaves the TARDIS alone, is mistaken for Zeus, king of the Greek gods and taken into the Greek camp.  Steven and later Vicki also leave the TARDIS, and all three are caught up in a variety of difficult circumstances.<br />This story contains a very strong streak of humour.  Some of the Doctor's suggestions for how to get past the walls of Troy are quite funny.  Homer's narration, which is full of anachronistic references, is also amusing (in a way that the TV serial never could have been).<br />If you like your Doctor Who deadly serious, then this certainly isn't the story for you!<br />'The Myth Makers' no longer exists on video tape in the BBC's vault.  It will therefore be welcome when the soundtrack is released on CD (scheduled for January 2001).	2000-10-17

This book is based on a serial that was first broadcast in 1964 and looks at the possible dangers of insecticides.<br />The TARDIS arrives in 1964 and, due to an accident on landing, the ship and its crew are miniaturised.  Much like the later &quot;Land of the Giants&quot; TV series, their adventures tend to centre on the threat of full-sized items to miniaturised people.  As you can imagine, the insecticide DN6 becomes a major peril.<br />Running parallel with this story is one for the full-sized people.  DN6 is under investigation, and its inventor will stop at nothing to prevent his own financial ruin if it is banned.  While the actions of the full-sized people have consequences for the Doctor, Susan, Barbara and Ian, it is not towards the end of the stories do our travellers start to have an impact on them.<br />The novelisation is a straightforward adaptation by the prolific Terrance Dicks.  While no literary masterpiece, it is certainly readable.  You may have to excuse some very questionable science, but that's not something new with Doctor Who.	2000-10-11

This book is the novelisation of her introductory story.<br />If you watch &quot;The Rescue&quot; on video, you will see that it is fairly insubstantial.  In fact, you'd probably doubt that any kind of decent book could have been made from it.  Luckily, Ian Marter shows otherwise.<br />By focussing on the fairly scant details provided in the televised story, Mr Marter adds detail and concentrates on character motivation to retell the story in more detail than is normal in the novelisation of Doctor Who stories.  He does this without grafting more on to the story (unlike, for instance, his adaptation of &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;) and hence the story is a true but enhanced version of the original.<br />This kind of adaptation is not common enough in Doctor Who stories, so read this one to see what could have (and should have!) been done.	2000-10-11

This is the novel based on their second appearance in Doctor Who.<br />Terrance Dicks adapts this story in a very straightforward manner.  As I'm inclined to say about a number of Mr Dicks' novelisations of these serials, the main problem is the lack of spirit in the writing.<br />There is a great degree of tragedy in this story: the human race largely wiped out, the survivors fighting a losing battle with their invaders, and individual stories of triumph and tragedy in a world greatly transformed by the Daleks.<br />It is a very different story from &quot;The Daleks&quot;, far more gritty (certainly the grittiest Doctor Who science fiction story that had been broadcast), and brings the treat of aliens into the backyard of the original viewers (although, for an Australian like me, its still a bitter distant).<br />Sadly, if you watch the original on video, the performances of the actors imbue the story with more life than Mr Dicks does.  The important last scene, which could be extremely emotional, is presented in a very dry fashion which relies on the reader to truly imbue it with emotion.  Given that Bill Hartnell's final major speech is a true delight to watch, it is a pity that it isn't presented in such an engaging way here.<br />Not a bad book, but not as good as the video.<br />(By the way, this story was later adapted into the movie &quot;Daleks Invasion Earth 2150AD&quot;.)	2000-10-11

(Novelisations did not recommence until 1973 under the Target banner.)<br />The Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Vicki arrive in twelfth century Palestine, and are soon split up: Barbara is captured by the Saracens, while the rest fall in with King Richard the Lionhearted.  While Ian is knighted and dispatched with a message to Saladin and to rescue Barbara, the Doctor and Vicki are caught up in court intrigue.  Given the way things go, one could argue which of them is in the most danger.<br />Strong characterisation by David Whitaker (author of both the original script and this book) makes this book a very good read (sadly, we only have half of the story still existing on video), and yet again demonstrates that the historical stories were often very good, exceeding the science fiction stories in some cases.<br />This book is illustrated by line drawings.

The most notable feature is the huge museum (from which the story derives its name).  A significant chunk of the book is taken up by the exploration of the museum, culminating in the discovery that they have &quot;jumped a time track&quot; and are seeing their future, which includes themselves on display as exhibits in the museum.  Then time rectifies itself, and they find themselves truly on Xeros before they are made exhibits...<br />While the remainder of the book, as the Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Vicki try to avoid their fate of ending up on display, has some interesting elements, not the least of which is speculation about whether various possible actions will ensure or prevent heir supposed fate, it takes place in a fairly dull environment.  The native Xerons are rising up against their conquerors, the Moroks, who have built the museum to display their triumphs in war (including the Daleks!  A most unlikely claim - I'm sure they were included on the cover to make the book sell better).<br />The novelisation is by Glyn Jones, who wrote the original script, but it fails to make the story much more interesting.  It has some good ideas that are swamped by the blandness of the rest.  Forgettable.	2000-10-11

They get caught up in the events, but not everything is at it seems...<br />Possibly if the revelations of what is really going on were less unpleasant I might have enjoyed this book more.

Sadly, it more closely resembles 'The Keys of Marinus' than 'The Daleks' or 'The Dalek Invasion of Earth'.<br />Getting John Peel to adapt this novel was a good idea.  Mr Peel is a great fan of the work of Mr Nation, and hence more likely to give it the best interpretation.  He also adds some continuity references to other stories.  Unfortunately, despite Mr Peel's efforts, it is let down by one thing - the original story.<br />In this story, the Daleks have invented a time travel ship not too dissimilar to the TARDIS (it looks quite different, though) and set off in pursuit of their enemies in the TARDIS.  It is a chase, going from one location to another.  Most of these are extremely bland, and an almost pointless exercise in building tension.<br />As well as their version of a TARDIS, the Daleks also have another new piece of technology: they create a robotic duplicate of the Doctor, who has the task of infiltrating the group of travellers and destroying them.  In the case of the book, we are spared the presence of an actor who doesn't look like Bill Hartnell playing the duplicate in many scenes.<br />The story actually doesn't take off until the end, where the TARDIS crew and the Daleks are on the planet Mechanus, where the threat of the Daleks and their duplicate are added to by the Mechonoids, a race of robots.<br />This story is also notable, as it sees the departure of companions Ian and Barbara and arrival of Steven.  Other than the Doctor himself, the TARDIS crew has changed entirely.  After this, the Doctor is almost always the focus of the stories.	2000-10-11

Steve Lyons' excellent Doctor Who historical is a &quot;must-read&quot; for all fans of the series.<br />The TARDIS arrives outside of Salem in 1692, although the travellers get the date wrong (they think it is a year earlier) and the Doctor asks his three travelling companions to stay in the village while he repairs the TARDIS.  It should have been peaceful...<br />Inevitably, they get caught up in the beginnings of the witch trials, but manage to escape, arriving fortuitously in 1954 (9 years earlier than Ian and Barbara want, to be able to return home) and take in a performance of Arthur Miller's &quot;The Crucible&quot;.  Seeing the fates of people she knew depicted on the stage, Susan uses the TARDIS' fast return switch to take them back to where they came from.<br />&quot;The Witch Hunters&quot; includes excellent characterisation of the three companions of the Doctor: Susan is young and brash and not quite human, and so forms a catalyst for the witch trials themselves; Ian is still eminently hopeful and heroic, and even believes it may be possible to save some of the victims of the trials; and Barbara is stoic and thoughtful, she has learned her lesson that history cannot change from &quot;The Aztecs&quot; and is now determined to save her fellow travellers above those they meet.<br />As the historical events inevitably unfold, it is the interaction of the four characters with each other and with the inhabitants of Salem that drive the book forward.  Not particularly a fun read, but very strongly character-driven - much as the series was at the period in which the novel is supposed to fall.	2000-10-11

This is during the reign of King James and is best remembered for the plot by Guy Fawkes to blow up the Houses of Parliament.<br />Gareth Roberts could have chosen to follow a fairly straightforward line in this book, but instead we end up with a plot worthy of a James Bond movie.  He also chooses to play with one of the fundamental ideas of the Hartnell era, summed up by the Doctor in 'The Aztecs': &quot;You can't rewrite history!  Not one line!&quot;  In this story, Guy Fawkes is the agent of a secret society and seems a fairly decent chap.  The possibility of history going off the rails occurs when Fawkes is killed by his co-conspirators.<br />The story takes the opportunity to parody various elements of Doctor Who.  In this story, like 'The Crusades', Vicki is obliged to dress as a boy and call herself Victor, supposedly to prevent unwarranted advances.  But in a takeoff of the pursuit of Barbara by Nero in 'The Romans', this merely brings her to the attention of King James, who is determined to have his way with &quot;Victor&quot;.<br />The translation of the Bible into the King James version is occurring during this book, and some of the efforts of the translators affords some humour.<br />While these are amusing, the depiction of the characters (especially the travellers) and Mr Roberts main story, how can history continue unchanged when Guy Fawkes is dead, are the bread and meat of this excellent story.  For me, it would have been improved if some of the most Bondian excesses had been cut, but they may very well appeal to other readers.	2000-10-11

The way the Venusians cope with the forthcoming end of their world, ranging from a fatalistic acceptance of the end to a wide variety of seemingly hair-brained schemes.  Different groups of Venusians are in conflict with each other.<br />While this isn't the Doctor's first trip to Venus, but his companions Ian and Barbara have a very difficult time coping with the alien society.  In fact, the Venusians way of &quot;remembering&quot; their dead family members (by eating them, which passes on some of the memories) makes their experiences even more strange than they might have been.<br />While the conflict continues, another group of aliens arrive offering to save the Venusians by moving them to Earth (billions of years before humanity evolved).  Can the travellers allow this to happen?  Are the Sou(ou)shi as benevolent as they appear?<br />(During Jon Pertwee's period playing the Doctor, he used what was often called Venusian aikido.  These odd five legged aliens are supposedly who this martial art was learnt from.  Now that's bizarre!)<br />There are a lot of questions, and reading this book to find the answers is (in my opinion) an excellent use of your time.	2000-10-11

The novel holds that, when the Doctor was called into his own future to assist with the Omega crisis (in 'The Three Doctors') he was assigned the task of chairing the convention, but due to an bureaucratic oversight this was erased along with memories of meeting his next two incarnations.<br />This book also introduces Time Lord Irving Braxiatel, who goes on to play a significant role in the life of seventh Doctor companion Bernice Summerfield.<br />Like 'The Plotters', another novel set in similar places in both actual history and the history of the show, we get to see a complex spy network involved with secret societies.  A number of historical figures are drawn into the story, including playwrights William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe (both spies in the employ of the English government) and Galileo Galilei.<br />The Convention plays a central role to the story, as different forces work to ensure it succeeds and opposing forces that it fails.  The Doctor's efforts are, in part, hindered by recently acquired companion Steven Taylor, who is a bit of a rogue element in the TARDIS crew.<br />Where this novel succeeds is by setting in place a complex web oif opposing forces, and guiding the TARDIS crew, and we readers, through it in what is both a stimulating and enjoyable read.	2000-10-11

They didn't.  What they did get with this book is a fairly interesting story of a quite alien world.<br />The Menoptera, who once ruled the world of Vortis, have been driven off when the previously docile Zarbi mysteriously become both organised and aggressive.  At the time when the Menoptera are re-invading, the TARDIS arrives and the Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Vicki find themselves split up and under threat from the various sides in the conflict.<br />Whereas the TV story looks rather clunky, as the special effect technology wasn't able to cope with the demands of the story, the novel allows for the reader to make the Zarbi, the Menoptera, the venom grubs, the Optera and even the Animus far better than they appeared on TV.  One does question, however, how useful the line illustrations in this novel are.  Their quality is variable, but not that good.<br />What we have here is an interesting concept, better realised in this book than on video, but if this kind of story was written these days it would have been even better (I suggest you read &quot;Venusian Lullaby&quot; instead).	2000-10-11

This story introduced the Monk, a mysterious traveller in time and space with his own TARDIS.  However, unlike the Doctor, the Monk wants to change history...<br />Set in 1066, not long before the Battle of Hastings.  The Monk is planning on supplying the Saxons with nuclear weapons so they can destroy the invading Vikings (talk about overkill!).  The Doctor, therefore, sets himself and his companions with the task of ensuring history stays on track.<br />Things are complicated by the Doctor's new companion, Steven, who seems happy enough to accept that the TARDIS can travel through space but doesn't believe it can traverse time.<br />This description may make the book sound better than it actually is.  It isn't bad, but not terribly wonderful either.  The problem is that, rather than adding in substantial interaction with natives of the time, the story ends up being the two Time Lords (although not called such at this point in the show's history) trying to out trick each other.	2000-10-11

This how included some props (and even cast members!) from &quot;Carry on Cleo&quot;.<br />The trick for Donald Cotton, who wrote the original script and also the novelisation, is that the televised story relies on both witty commentary and slapstick.  Slapstick doesn't translate to the written word, so Mr Cotton plays up some of the witty wordplay and adds a new level of comedy by producing this as an epistolary novel rather than a straight novelisation.<br />Extracts from the journal of Ian Chesterton, the diary of the Doctor, Nero's scrapbook and other sources combine together to lay out the televised story, but in an interesting format.<br />It is a good strategy, which helps this book stand out amongst the many simple and straightforward novelisation of Doctor Who serials.	2000-10-11

Unfortunately, he appeared to get tired and some of the novels are a bit lacklustre.  This is one of them.<br />&quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; is, in essence, two stories: the meeting of the Doctor and Susan with Ian and Barbara, and then an adventure at &quot;the dawn of history&quot;.  The relative importance of the two stories is shown by the number of pages Mr Dicks allocates to each: about 40 to the first, and about 80 to the second.  In the original serial, the first was one episode, and the second three episodes.<br />The first story is the more interesting, as it sets the longest-running science fiction serial in motion, establishing a mystery that would not be resolved for years.  Two school teachers (Ian and Barbara) investigate the home of a mysterious pupil (Susan) and end up travellers in time and space.<br />The second story sees the travellers captured by a tribe of cavemen with a leadership crisis.  The leader is the one who can make fire, and this secret is lost.  The travellers must decide whether to give them the secret of making fire, and who to give it to.  One of the strengths of this story is the endeavour to portray the cavemen as a simple people, without real understanding of the world.  It is interesting to see how they try to express new concepts in their dealings with the travellers.<br />What lets this novelisation down is that, whilst Mr Dicks is faithful in his adaptation of the original, it lacks the spark and spirit one would wish to see.  You're probably better off watching the video than reading this book.	2000-10-10

However, their civilisation doesn't make a lot of sense.<br />The TARDIS arrives on a human spaceship orbiting the planet Sense-Sphere.  The crew of the ship appear to be dead, but turned out to be paralysed by the Sensorites, who are the natives of the planet.  Given the unthreatening and occasionally comical appearance of these aliens, the big build up to their arrival is somewhat amusing.<br />All is not well on Sense-Sphere.  The Sensorites are dying from a mysterious plague that only started after a previous human expedition.  The Doctor is obliged to assist them in curing the plague in order to regain the TARDIS lock, which the Sensorites have removed (at this early point in the program's history, the crew were depicted as travellers who end up having adventures rather than actually seeking them out, so there is always a reason why they can't leave).  The seeking of a cure becomes even more desperate when Ian succumbs to the plague...<br />One advantage that Nigel Robinson has in novelising this story is that the reader's imagination will establish better sets and props than were present in the televised story.  However, in writing a straightforward novelisation, he is inevitably tied to the political intrigue plot line, which all hangs off the ludicrous proposition that the Sensorites are so physically identical that even they themselves can't tell each other apart except for variations in clothing.<br />I say: a good attempt given the original material he had to work with.	2000-10-10

It is envisaged to occur very early in the first season of the series, where the story lines essentially alternat between historical and science fiction.  How a story featuring magic, elves and dragons would have gone over is a good question.<br />I found the story quite enjoyable.  The setting is an excellent change of pace for Doctor Who, and Christopher Bulis populates the story with a variety of memorable characters.  The crew of the TARDIS are thrust into a world that shouldn't exist, and cannot re-enter the TARDIS due to some automatic defence mechanism which has activated for no apparent reason.  (There is a reason, of course - but it is so integrally tied up with the conclusion of the story that I won't say any more about it!)<br />Needing to re-enter the TARDIS to leave, the Doctor is obliged to study magic in order to learn the way in which this world works.  Kidnapped by Marton Dhal, Susan too gains some magical skills.  However, as you'd expect, there's more to all this magic than meets the eye as the travellers and the inhabitants of Elbyon discover at the climax of the book.<br />Mr Bulis has a good descriptive turn of prose which makes it easy to envisage what this story might have looked like, but not if made with the technology used when this stories supposed contemporaries were made.  I'm sure it would have been a visual treat.	2000-10-10

Mr Marter wrote a number of novelisations, and have one thing in common - he endeavours to add sufficient detail to expand the story beyond a simple and straightforward novelisation.<br />In this story, the TARDIS arrives back on Earth - not, as Ian and Barbara hope, back in the London of 1963 but just outside of Paris in 1794, during the French Revolution.  Captured (other than the Doctor) by soldiers, they are cast into prison as suspected spies and get caught up in various political machinations within the complex and paranoid French society.<br />While The Reign of Terror was probably the first Doctor Who story with deliberate comedy included, I don't think this translated well to the written word.  Perhaps this is no bad thing.<br />The standout aspect of this novelisation, when compared to many others of Doctor Who stories, is the comparative richness of the text.  Mr Marter could have written this book with less words, but rather than ignoring the detail of the world in which the travellers find themselves, he embroiders detail which assist in making this far more than many of its fellow novelisations.  Given the often grimness of the period in which it is set, this helps in bringing the story to life.	2000-10-10

In this story, the TARDIS crew arrive towards the end of the Aztec civilisation and, unsurprisingly, find themselves unable to re-enter the tomb in which the TARDIS materialised.  They must deal with the Aztecs (in whose city they have arrived) in order to find the way back to the ship.<br />Comparing this book with the television story that it is based upon is inevitable.  On the screen, very strong performances (in particular by Jacqueline Hill as Barbara and John Ringham as Tlotoxl) bring the story to wonderful life, so it is disappointing that the novel is not as engaging.<br />It does, however, contain an excellent storyline.  Barbara is mistaken for a reincarnation of a previous high priest, and is determined to moderate the more bloodthirsty aspects of Aztec society in the hope that the Spaniards won't wipe them out and the good aspects of their civilisation can be preserved (Barbara obviously has a higher opinion of colonial powers in the thirteenth century than I!).  She enters into this plan against the advice of the Doctor.<br />Speaking of whom, the Doctor's unintentional (?) romance during this story is quite delightful, but again the original performances by Bill Hartnell and Margot van der Burgh (playing Cameca) are better to watch than reading this book.<br />Early in Doctor Who's history, it was quite possible for the travelling companions to play the most important role in a story, and this story is certainly Barbara's.  However, the novel is not exactly awe-inspiring and so, given a choice, I'd watch the video.	2000-10-10

While this Dalek story firmly established Doctor Who as a favourite in the hearts of the public, it is rather sad to see that his second script was a cliche-ridden story that might just as well have been a Flash Gordon serial (no offence to Flash Gordon fans, but the ideal stories for the two characters are very different!).<br />The TARDIS arrives on the island Marinus, where the crew are captured but later convince the Keeper of the Conscience of Marinus that they are not saboteurs - unlike the Voord, who they help the Keeper to overcome.  Arbitan, the Keeper, sets the travellers on a quest to obtain the microcircuit keys that control the Conscience, a computer that governs the world and eliminates feelings of evil, so that it can be reset to also influence the Voord.<br />Each key is hidden in a location which the travellers must explore to find it, overcoming a variety of perils.  Unfortunately, even for 1964 when this story was broadcast, the perils are old hat as are the ways in which the travellers overcome them.<br />Philip Hinchcliffe's novelisation is quite workmanlike, but given the paucity of the original story can't do too much to rise it out of the ranks of mediocrity in which it rightly belongs.	2000-10-10

He chooses to follow the obvious path: a direct translation of a television story to the written word.<br />The story is based on a simple premise: the TARDIS materialises in the Himalayas and the travellers meet up with Marco Polo and his caravan.  Marco wants to return to Venice, but Kublai Khan won't allow him.  He thinks that, if he presents the mysterious TARDIS to the great Kahn he may be allowed to return home.<br />So, a reasonably large proportion of the story involves the Doctor, and to a lesser extent Susan, Ian and Barbara, trying to regain possession of their ship.  However, it is also concerned with Marco Polo and two of his travelling companions: Ping-Cho, a young girl engaged to be married to a man she has never met at the Khan's court, and the warlord Tegana, servant of the Khan Nogai, an enemy of Kublai Khan supposedly on a peace mission.<br />In the original format of Doctor Who, the stories were meant to contain a substantial educative component.  This one does, delighting in a variety of moderately obscure facts, perhaps the most interesting of which surround the Hashashins (or Assassins, as we would say), a political force who gain power through terror and the threat of assassination.<br />The story is, in essence, a road trip for the travellers who eventually end up in the court of the great Khan, where the Doctor endeavours to regain the TARDIS in a game of backgammon.  But on the way, there are a variety of adventures and odd happenings.<br />I suspect that this story would have worked better in its original form, but sadly the BBC have destroyed all tapes of the serial this book is based upon.  It makes a reasonably engaging, if almost entirely unchallenging, read.	2000-10-10

The story itself is marred by some very peculiar decision on the acting styles of some of the regulars.<br />Fortunately, in this novel, we are spared this.  This novel largely focusses around Barbara as a mysterious force invades the TARDIS and some of the travellers, particularly Susan, act oddly.  Tensions between the characters increase as the Doctor becomes suspicious that Ian and Barbara have caused the problem by endeavouring to return to Earth by meddling with the control console.<br />The main strength of this book is the insight into the thoughts of the characters, particularly Barbara.  While it is possible to watch the TV serial and develop views about what they are thinking, this book takes the guesswork out of this (which is good, given some of the odd performances mentioned above).<br />The weak point of this book is that it begins (again!) with a recap of the first meeting of the TARDIS crew.  If you were reading the novelisations in broadcast order, this would be the third and has the third depiction of this event.<br />Overall, a good novelisation that surpasses the original.	2000-10-09

Now, Mel has never been the most popular of the Doctor's travelling companions, which I suspect is partially because of her overly exuberant personality and partially because none of the stories she appeared in really suited her.<br />In her first appearance in a Big finish audio play, I was happy to see that situation reversed.  Mel firmly takes centre stage in this adventure set in the last days of Pompeii, with Vesuvius about to erupt.  We learn that the Doctor was aware that his TARDIS had been found buried in Pompeii, and had avoided going there.  But, having arrived by accident, he feels that he has no choice but to stay and let events proceed, even if it means his death.<br />Mel refuses to accept that there is no choice but to accept that the future is set. Her attempts to save the Doctor, herself and others from the eruption of Vesuvius shows her character's strong points at their best. <br />The Doctor's late conversion from a fatalist to someone willing to her try to change the future seems out of character. <br />Not the best of the Big Finish productions to date (but please note that the general quality is high), this one is certainly worth listening to.	2000-10-08

In a somewhat unsystematic purging, many classics were consigned to the flames, including several Doctor Who stories. Fortunately, some fans of the series had made their own audio recordings, and these (following a thorough re-mastering by the BBC) are being released.<br />&quot;The Macra Terror&quot; is one of these releases. The story features a human colony under siege from a race of monsters - not an unusual description of a Patrick Troughton story. What makes this story unique is the nature of the colony - set up like an archetypical British holiday camp, the enforced bon hommie and cheerful tunes cast it in a different light...   <br />The comparatively recent addition of Jamie to the TARDIS crew mean that all three companions (the other two being Ben and Polly) have smaller roles than might be desirable. The Doctor is very much on centre stage in this story, and Pat Troughton is well in his stride in the part.<br />Linking narration is by Colin Baker, who played the Doctor's sixth incarnation, and is surprisingly subdued given Baker's portrayal of the Doctor. The visual aspects of the show would probably added quite a bit to the enjoyment of the show (particularly in setting the holiday camp tone), but based on stills the appearance of the Macra is probably not truly missed.<br />The story is quite strong and not unduly tied in to the shows ongoing history, so is suitable for both fans and casual listeners...	2000-10-08

Most every other character in the Sherlock Holmes milieu seems to have series of stories written about them, so why not his landlady Mrs. Hudson?<br />This is the first of a series (last time I looked, four novels have been published) and represents Emma Hudson's first solo case as a detective.  According to the book, she has made a number of suggestions about Holmes' cases before this book, but thus has been hushed up by Watson.  (An aside: I found the name Emma a bit of a surprise, since most other authors name her Martha - but it appears she wasn't given a Christian name by Conan Doyle, so Emma will do.)<br />While Holmes and Watson are out of town, Mrs. Hudson receives a telegram from an old friend, seeking Holmes' aid in a matter.  She immediately packs her bag and finds herself in the middle of a non-investigation of a murder at a country house.  With the exception of her friend, Violet Warner, none of the occupants of the house believe Lady St. Clair was murdered (or so they say...), and it is not until a second murder victim is found that the police show the slightest interest.<br />Mr. Hosier has put together a decent mystery, and although I worked out whodunit (in regards the first murder) about two-thirds of the way through, I hadn't worked out all the details or how the two murders were actually connected.<br />My one complaint: Vi Warner's astral projections.  To me, this is a lazy way of allowing characters to find out things without having to work for it.  It allows the author to avoid coming up with ways for the detectives to gain clues.  What role it plays in future books in this series I will wait to see, but I'm sceptical.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this book as a way to relax with some mental stimulation, and will read others in the series in due course.	2000-10-08

Watson, son of his late chronicler.  Dan Kilcup obviously tries to produce stories worth reading, but sadly doesn't succeed.<br />The problems, to me, are a poor portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, a failure to depict the Edwardian age in a believable fashion, and an attempt to use language beyond the author's grasp of vocabulary.<br />Kilcup's Holmes is an extraordinarily arbitrary character.  I have no problems with the fact that Holmes is not infallible as this is consistent with Conan Doyle's portrayal.  However, some of his actions are very strange, and do nothing to progress his investigations.  I think his intention was to make Holmes likable, but I think he fails.<br />In setting stories in a particular time period, an author should portray the period believably.  Mr Kilcup's characters use oddly harsh language - not necessarily for our time, but for that about which we are reading.  Other things, details like Holmes' unlikely query of a London cabby as to when the next train to Brussels leaves, grate rather harshly.<br />With these factors distracting the reader, Mr Kilcup's use of words in the wrong context certainly makes the reading of this book a chore.<br />Sorry, Mr Kilcup, but not worth the time I spent reading it let alone the money I spent buying it.	2000-10-05

It isn't a bad book, but unfortunately it isn't a great one either.<br />From my perspective, this book reads like a re-run of &quot;The Burning&quot; - which is unfortunate, since it folows on from that book.  The Doctor turns up in a small English village, notionally without his memory and with his TARDIS unavailable as it is healing.  A mysterious force from the beginnings of time is threatening the village and, after numerous casualties, the Doctor and some temporarily acquired friends triumph.<br />Unfortunately, for the second of so far two books in this story arc, I really had no impression that the Doctor is without his memory.  His actions are so normal that this is unnoticeable.  As in &quot;The Burning&quot;, a variety of interesting characters are introduced solely for the purpose of killing them off.  Once upon a time, death wasn't something that happened in every one of the Doctor's adventures.  It would be nice if this happened again, even just once!<br />However, this is all a little too harsh.  Steve Emmerson in what I believe is his first book shows that he certainly has the ability to write a readable book.  Had it not been preceded by &quot;The Burning&quot;, &quot;Casualties of War&quot; might have been a more enjoyable experience for me.  So Steve, please write another!	2000-09-30

It's an odd place - Baker's second last season is (in my opinion) one of the worst in the show's history, while his last was a return to the excellence that accompanied Baker's arrival in the role.<br />This book therefore manages to combine some of the odd humour of season sixteen with the better production quality of season seventeen.  Into the bargain, a story idea that should have been used in the show at some time is featured.  The Doctor, Romana and K9 arrive at a place where they have just been, and must travel back in time to carry out the activities that they have been told they have done.<br />Like the last month's Past Doctor novel, Imperial Moon, the Doctor has some foreknowledge of what is happening but must act to preserve the web of time.  And in this case, the Doctor is told he sacrificed his life to save the day.<br />Given the crossing of the timelines inherent in the story, Jonathan Morris does an excellent job in making the story plain when it could have been confusing.  He does this in two ways: firstly, with strong and memorable scenes which stay in the reader's mind; and secondly, by use of somewhat cliched characters.  Obviously, I approve of the former but the latter is another harking back to season sixteen.<br />&quot;Festival of Death&quot; is a good read, and given the similarity of theme to &quot;Imperial Moon&quot; it is interesting to compare and contrast the two different incarnations of the Doctor in their approaches.	2000-09-22

The results are variable.<br />The book is overshadowed by Holmes'  failure to stop a massive fire that kills hundred of people.  While this  may seem to give away part of the story, it is plainly revealed in the  blurb, broadly hinted at in the introduction, and the extent of the fire is  shown on a map before the novel begins!<br />Instead, the reader gets to watch  Holmes seeking to discover who is behind the impending disaster.  So, while  Millett's depiction of Holmes' deductive activity is fine.  Most of the  clues Holmes relies upon are in plain sight of the reader, which is not  always the case in a Holmes' story, so perhaps some readers can enjoy  matching withs with the Great Detective.<br />I found Millett's portrayl of  Holmes a little off-key, and this is highlighted by Watson maiking  references to Holmes' unusual behaviour.  Not being from Minnesota (or even  America!) I cannot comment of the depiction of the area and its people, but  for a foreigner they seemed quite natural.<br />Millett has written two  further Holmes novels - &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Ice Palace Murder  (hinted at in the closing pages of this book) and &quot;Sherlock Holmes and  the Runestone Mystery&quot; - both of which I believe are also set in  Minnesota.  Based on this book, I believe they are likely to be worth a  read.	2000-09-19

And it will also be no surprise  for me to say that the ship sinks towards the end of the book.<br />William  Seil sets out to set up an intriguing group of passengers, many of who have  ulterior motives, as Holmes and Watson form part of a party protecting  secret submarine plans being transported to America on the Titanic's maiden  voyage.<br />The cast includes relatives of better-known Holmesian mainstays -  we have Christine Norton, daughter of Irene Adler, and Colonel James  Moriarty, brother to the more famous professor.  As well as fictional  characters, actual members of the crew and passengers of the Titanic play  their roles.  I was well pleased to see mystery writer Jacques Futrelle  given a significant role in the novel.  Sadly, Futrelle's stories of  Professor Van Dusen, the Thinking Machine, have been allowed to fall out of  print, but it is particularly good to see Watson and Futrelle make  reference to the Thinking Machine's exploits and to contrast them to  Holmes' own during the novel.  I'd suggest that his role is a due tribute  to one of the many victims of the Titanic's fatal voyage.<br />As the novel  progresses, a number of stories are played out as the reader sees the  different suspects duly investigated.  The characters are driven by a  perceived deadline in the ship's arrival in New York, but we readers know  that the iceberg is waiting to cut short the events of the book.<br />This is  Seil's first book (and only to date...), and does show some of the  weaknesses of first books - such as a desire to pack too much in.  However,  his writing style is pleasing and characters fairly well-defined.  While  not breaking new ground (hardly a requirement in a Holmes' book) is a  decent if unchallenging read.	2000-09-10

The writing style is very clean and clear but, for me, lacking in  character.<br />In this particular volume, the three members of the brigade  (Danny, Peachy and Duff) are drawn into the events surrounding the arrival  of a Persian crown in London, and the possibility that its legendary curse  is real.<br />Unlike the first two, this book seems less concerned with  solving the mystery than in concentrating on events particular to the  characters which arise out of the investigation.  While this is no bad  thing, it is perhaps not what might have been expected.  I was also  surprised that Dr Watson did not even rate a mention, given the medical  nature of one of the problems under examination.<br />For me, this book was a  very quick read that provided a modest degree of satisfaction.  For parents  looking at buying books for their children, I would suggest that this  series would encourage examination of problems and solutions rather than  jumping to conclusions.  They are also likely to be a good introduction to  Sherlock Holmes and his world.	2000-09-10

Whether this  is an alternate universe, someone tampering with history, or some other  explanation is one of the nubs of the story.<br />Being set in 1878,  Christopher Bulis has drawn from the literature of the time for the feel of  the story.  The ghosts of Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, H. Rider Haggard and  Arthur Conan Doyle appear to have been whispering in Mr. Bulis' ear.   However, in advancing the story and bringing it to its conclusion, it is  contemporary science fiction of Doctor Who that sets the tone.<br />The Doctor  is in his fifth incarnation (portrayed on TV by Peter Davison) and is  assisted by the less than trust-inspiring pairing of Turlough (who joined  the TARDIS crew to kill the Doctor for the Black Guardian) and Kamelion (a  former slave of the Master).  Like in real life, Kamelion plays a  relatively minor role (the Kamelion robot proved too problematic to use  prominently in filming the series), so it largely falls to the Doctor and  Turlough, and their astral mariner allies, to deal with the mysteriously  populated jungle crater on the lunar surface.<br />The novel has obviously  been well thought through by Mr. Bulis, who displays his influences  proudly, and the moral dilemma of Turlough is well-portrayed and within the  established scope of his character.  The portrayal of the Victorian  characters is good, and I especially enjoyed the inclusion of Queen  Victoria and her gillie, John Brown, who open the book and... but that would  be telling!  Captain Richard Halliwell and Miss Emily Boyes-Dennison, who  carry a moderate portion by themselves, appear to be included in part to  show the impact of the &quot;New Woman&quot; on Victorian society.<br />I  found it a good read, which I believe would benefit from close attention  however having the advantage of not requiring it.  It seemed well-suited to  the Davison-era of Doctor Who, although perhaps earlier than it is set as  it doesn't suffer from the efforts of the script editor of the season it  was set in trying to make the show more &quot;grim and gritty&quot;.	2000-09-02

Unfortunately for me, Bernard Bale seems more interested  in going through Jon Pertwee's life with emphasis on a series of amusing  anecdotes.<br />While this may have been fine, I got stronger impressions of  the author's personality than I did that of the subject.  At several  points, Mr Bale makes comments which are obviously his opinion on a topic,  but which have little to do with Jon Pertwee.  For example, saying  &quot;Probably today's society has relaxed school rules to a ridiculous  level...&quot; (p16) sufficiently annoyed me that I began to dread what  other personal opinions Mr Bale would foist upon me.<br />I was, however,  pleased I continued because there is a truly wonderful part of the book  awaiting.  Jon Pertwee's last wife, Ingeborg, contributes recollections of  her life with her husband, which takes up a significant part of the book  (p160-237 of 246 pages!) which is a delight to read.  It is during this  section that we get a window on Jon Pertwee the man, rather than the public  figure.  (I am actually a little mystified that Ingeborg Pertwee was not  listed as the co-author of the book.)<br />If you are a fan of Jon Pertwee,  this book, especially the recollections of Ingeborg Pertwee, will help put  his achievements as an actor into perspective with his life.  Probably best  read in conjunction with Jon Pertwee's final memoir (&quot;I am the  Doctor&quot; by Jon Pertwee and David J Howe).<br />My rating is essentially 2  stars for Bernard Bale's part of the book, and 4 stars for Ingeborg  Pertwee's.	2000-08-26

Watson, M.D.	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Odd concept, but good stories	'Resurrected Holmes' is a somewhat convoluted idea well-executed.  It is a  collection of short Sherlock Holmes stories supposedly written by other  well-known authors.  In other words, the actual authors who wrote the  stories had to write them in the style of the purported authors, who were  supposedly endeavouring to write in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Watsonian  voice.<br />Now, that may or may not take your fancy.  What is needs to be  said is that, by and large, the stories in this volume are of an excellent  quality, so even if the literary conceit that is the book's starting point  fails to please you, the stories themselves should.<br />For true Holmes  completists, each story is one of the unchronicled stories referred to by  Watson in his accounts of Holmes' investigations (with the exception of the  final story, which reveals the truth behind 'The Adventure of the Second  Stain').<br />In some cases (for example, 'The Adventure of the Boulevard  Assassin' and 'The Madness of Colonel Warburton', ascribed to Jack Kerouac  and Dashiell Hammett respectively) the voice of the putative author  occassionally overwhelms the Holmesian nature and may be a substantial  distraction for those reading this book purely as a Sherlock Holmes  collection.<br />However, some of the stories are good enough to warrant the  price of admission alone.  I particularly enjoyed 'The Adventure of  Ricoletti of the Club Foot (and his abominable wife)', notionally written  by P.G. Wodehouse, in that it managed to be both a convincing Holes story  while also being a comedy of manners that its putative author might well  have appreciated.<br />Marvin Kaye knows his Sherlock Holmes, and this volume  plainly displays his (and the contributing authors) deep-felt love and  admiration for the Holmesian canon.  Recommended.	2000-08-26

Later, they are called upon to investigate Houdini's death.<br />As well as  showing Holmes' deductive powers, the high falutin lifestyle and odd  circumstances of the death of Houdini, the novel manages to cast light on  the political situation of Hungary between the two world wars.<br />As a  bonus, Andrews throws in two encounters between Holmes and his creator, Sir  Arthur Conan Doyle.<br />By combining diverse plot elements with a fine touch  in characterisation and a surprise outcome, this book, like most of Val  Andrews' Holmes pastiches, is a satisfying read.	2000-08-20

He seems determined to  portray the British characters as upper-class twits, sometimes only in the  speech patterns but often in their other actions.<br />I was also disappointed  that Mycroft was not either a complete armchair theorist nor a man of  action.  Had he been portrayed as one or the other, he might have seemed  more consistent.  Instead, while he states an unwillingness to carry out  physical activity, when the time comes he charges in with the best of them  without a second thought at the time later.<br />My view: a clever plot  somewhat let down by the characterisation and writing.  I understand that  Glen Petrie has written other Mycroft Holmes books, which I would be happy  to read.	2000-08-20

As also noted, women in general, regardless of their  class, are similarly unable to move outside easily perceived behaviour.   Those who can, like Irene Adler, are given masculine traits and then  married off to ciphers.<br />A number of Victorian scandals and their  influence on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing are identified.<br />For those  students of Victorian history, or those interested in the Holmesian canon,  this book provides insight and views from odd angles. I found it an easy  read due to Jann's writing style, which detailed her arguments without  bogging me down in verly technical language.	2000-08-13

It  is easy to sit back and observe these stories dispassionately, because they  lack any passion.<br />The closest Mr. Hammer comes to providing a true  continuataion of Doyle's writing is in the last, best and longest of the  stories, &quot;The Matter of the Furnival Curse&quot;.  It is in this story  that the characters come closest to achieving some semblence of  humanity.<br />The book is very well presented, but good packaging doesn't  make up for a lack of substantial content.	2000-08-13

Sherlock Holmes pastiches tend to fall into two categories: those that  seek to simply tell another adventure, and those that try to turn our  preconceptions of the Great Detective topsy turvy.  The Adamantine Sherlock  Holmes falls into the latter category.<br />Starting with Holmes' claim to  have spent some of the &quot;Great Hiatus&quot; in Tibet, Hapi proposes a  liaison between him and Irene Adler which produces a son named Redlock who  sets out to become his father's antithesis.  This decision is based of the  many examples of paternalistic and Euro-centric bias in Doyle's writings,  enumerated at great length, which infuriate Redlock and drive him to seek  to undo his father's deeds.<br />Sprinkled liberally with Buddhist parallels  found in the Holmesian Canon, this book seeks to show Holmes' journey to  enlightenment from the Imperial mentality of his creator.<br />For me, while I  can appreciate the obvious scholarship that went into its writing, it is a  little overly preachy and contains too much of a &quot;West is bad, East is  good&quot; mentality.  I think Hapi would have been better to have  concentrated in telling a story, rather than giving us a redemption of  Sherlock Holmes which is drowned in copious footnotes.	2000-08-06

Atkinson describes his readings as &quot;eccentric&quot;, a view which I  must support.  By drawing parallels between the stories and a variety of  literary, pop cultural and religious matters, some far better known than  others, Atkinson reveals sidelights on well-known stories which should  delight many readers.<br />The book would be of interest to students of  literary criticism or ardent Holmesians, and especially to those who are  both.<br />My view: a good and stimulating read that encouraged me to re-read  old favouites.	2000-04-29
