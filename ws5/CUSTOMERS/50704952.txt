Hayley Albright cares for her younger siblings and a house full of eccentric &quot;staff.&quot;  She's got a full plate and then some. But she can't walk away from the injured man she finds on a trip home from London, so she simply adds him to her responsibilities, and soon he's like a member of the family.  Only she's never wanted to kiss a member of the family in quite the same way she enjoys kissing Stephen Barrattson, the simple tutor who's stumbled into her life.<br />Stephen doesn't know what to make of this odd household where children are seen and heard with regularity, where hugs, kisses and smiles are given away without a thought, where a simple tutor is made to feel at home.  With all his heart he  wishes he was a tutor, so he could stay in the warm embrace of this family...of this woman.  But Stephen has a secret.  He's no tutor.  He has a title, and has someone trying to kill him.  For everyone's sake, he has to walk away.  The only problem is, he's leaving his heart behind.<br />Stephen has a few really stupid moments, but as much as I wanted to smack him, they fit his character, and he did redeem himself in my eyes in the end.  And Hayley was one of my favorite types of heroine--able to take on the world, and yet willing to open her herself to love. This was a delightful book, full of unique characters and a love story that twisted my heart.	2001-02-22

Her life is following a set course until it's tossed topsy turvy and Nerienne finds herself allied with one of her mother's enemies in a battle to save  Gayome.  Durgan is a man denying his legacy as he fights for his people's  freedom from the tyranny of Gayome's ruler.  The last thing he ever  expected was to be allied with the next ruler . . . and even worse, to be  falling in love with her when he has every reason to hate her for all the  hardship her mother produced during her reign.<br />In Dreamsinger, JA  Ferguson has built a believable world, believeable conflicts, but more than  that, she's created two characters who are fighting against the odds to  save their world, their people and to create a love that would touch the  hearts of any world.	1999-11-28
